INTRODUCTION \n1.  South Asia\u2019s financial markets are among the least integrated. Domestic credit rating \nagencies (DCRAs)\u2014there are nine of these in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka,1  and financial \nsector  regulators  in  Bhutan,  the  Maldives,  and  Nepal  have  begun  to  prepare  for  the \nestablishment of DCRAs\u2014have a vital role in developing South Asia\u2019s financial and capital \nmarkets and facilitating the integration of its financial markets. The Basel II Accord has spurred \nproposals for improvements in the prudential regulation and supervision of DCRAs in view of the \ncomplex credit risk involved in structured financial products, especially after the global financial \ncrisis that began in 2008. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported DCRAs with \nequity investments since 1987.2 This time, with the proposed technical assistance3 (TA), ADB \nseeks to help build robust financial systems in South Asia through more effective use of credit \nrating information and a prudential regulatory framework for DCRAs. The sharing of information \non  each  country\u2019s  DCRA  policies,  regulations,  and  issues  will  strengthen  financial  sector \ncooperation and integration and make South Asian DCRAs more credible and visible. The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  DCRAs  promote  a  credit  culture,  increase  transparency,  and  reduce  information \nasymmetry between lenders and investors, thus enabling investors to make informed decisions. \nThe sharing of credit information levels the playing field among market participants and fosters \ncompetition in the financial system. Credit reporting4 makes a debtor\u2019s quality much  more \ntransparent. Good borrowers are rewarded, and it becomes more costly to default on obligations.  \n \n3.  DCRAs  build  information  frameworks  critical  to  the  efficiency  of  financial  markets. \nInvestors  can  optimize  their  risk\u2013return  profiles,  monitor  their  portfolios  through  regular \nsurveillance and credit rating adjustments, and have timely information for trading and risk \nmanagement. Issuers can assess their loan risk and raise funds under given market conditions, \nand are encouraged to conform to prudential and best corporate practices. Other financial \nintermediaries (such as commercial banks) can better assess risk on behalf of clients. Financial \nregulators are able to exercise more efficient prudential regulation and supervision. \n \n4.  The DCRAs now operating in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka are supervised by \nsecurity regulators. These countries differ from one another in the ownership, size of operations, \nand business focus of their DCRAs, as well as in the penetration and use of credit rating \ninformation  in  their  financial  markets  and  regulations.  But  Basel  II  has  underscored  the \nsignificance of DCRAs in external credit assessment. Under the accord commercial banks must \n                                                 \n1  These  are  (i)  Credit  Rating  Agency  of  Bangladesh  (CRAB),  (ii)  Credit  Rating  Information  and  Services \n(Bangladesh), (iii) Brickwork Ratings(India), (iv) Credit Analysis & Research (CARE) (India), (v) CRISIL (India), (vi) \nInvestment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India (ICRA), (vii) Fitch Ratings India, (viii) Fitch Ratings \nLanka (Sri Lanka), and (ix) RAM Ratings (Lanka) (Sri Lanka). In India, there are other credit rating information \ncompanies using a name of credit rating agency but they are not under the registration of Securities Exchange \nBoard of India.  Those are Dun & Bradstreet, SMERA, ONICRA, and Micro-Credit ratings International.    \n2  An equity investment of Rs0.6 million ($0.45 million) was made in CRISIL (India) in 1987, RM0.49 million ($0.19 \nmillion) in RAM (Malaysia) in 1990, and B5 million ($0.2 million) in TRIS Rating (Thailand) in 1993.  \n3  This TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 February 2010.  \n4  More accurate and transparent financial statements, based on International Financial Reporting Standards, can \nhelp reduce information asymmetries between debtors and creditors. \n ", "2   \nrate their loan assets independently to calculate risk weight and determine capital adequacy. \nThe fact that many of these banks still do not have internal credit rating systems heightens their \nneed for the credit rating information from DCRAs.  \n \n5.  The global financial crisis that began in 2008 showed the importance of monitoring the \nmethods and practices used by credit rating agencies in assessing debt obligation and debt \ninstruments. Financial regulators in advanced economies have made efforts to deal with credit \nrating inadequacies or weaknesses. In emerging economies, such as those in South Asia, the \nprudential regulation and supervision of DCRAs is no less critical to the transparency and \nefficiency of debt instruments. DCRAs are deemed to have a better understanding of the \ndomestic sovereign environment and local companies because they have more access to local \ninformation than their global counterparts. But DCRA ratings\u2014their transparency, accuracy, \nautonomy, and quality\u2014are still a concern to investors. In South Asia, while the code of conduct \nfor  credit  rating  agencies  of  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  is \nrecognized as common practice, each regulator has its own regulatory principles, compliance \nframework, and enforcement mechanism for DCRAs.5  The status of each country\u2019s regulatory \nframework for DCRAs must therefore be examined, and best practices in compliance and \nenforcement determined on the basis of dialogue among country regulators and DCRAs.  \n \n6.  In Bhutan, the Maldives, and Nepal, the banking sector dominates the provision of funds \nfor private sector development. The capital markets are still nascent, with a limited numbers of \ncompanies  listed  on  the  stock  exchanges  and  negligible  trading  of  public  bonds  in  the \nsecondary markets. No DCRAs are operating. But there is growing demand for corporate bonds \nand an increasing need to streamline public debt issues and market rules. The central banks in \nthese  countries  plan  to  introduce  risk-based  supervision  under  Basel  II,  which  involves \ncalculating capital adequacy by linking risk to cost of capital. Credit information bureaus have \nbeen established to store data on the interest payment and repayment of loans by borrowers.6 \nAt a time when the monetary and security authorities are preparing for the framework for \nestablishing a credit rating agency and the provision of credit rating information to the financial \nmarkets, a study to identify areas where the information could be effectively used would be \nbeneficial.7 \n \n7.  DCRAs are a key part of resource mobilization. They support private sector development \nby  giving  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  better  access  to  finance  and  by \npromoting infrastructure development through more efficient flow of information. A vibrant SME \nsector attracts investments and creates jobs, thereby lessening the impact of the economic \nslowdown in South Asia. But since the SME sector is largely informal and has no organized \ninformation on industries, market shares, competition dynamics, or management track record, \nSME creditworthiness must be assessed with tools and methods that are different from those \nused  for  large  corporations.  DCRAs,  by  virtue  of  their  credit  rating  skills  based  on  vast \nexperience with country-specific data, have helped expand financial services to underserved \n                                                 \n5  To this end, ADB prepared a handbook on international best practice in credit rating in December 2008. ADB 2006. \nTechnical Assistance for Capacity Building and Regional Cooperation of Selected Credit Rating Agencies in Asia. \nManila (TA 6372-REG).  \n6  Credit information bureaus created by the central banks operate in all the South Asian countries.  \n7  Besides its use in rating bond issues in local currency, the credit rating  information or expertise of a credit rating \nagency  can be used in rating initial public offerings, security receipts, SMEs, corporate governance, mutual funds, \nfinancial facilities, and insurance companies.  \n ", "  3\nsegments of the SME sector.8 This will allow risk-based pricing in lending to the sector and thus \nunlock capital in the banks for increased lending to the SMEs. SME credit rating by DCRAs (i) is \nconducive to more efficient decision making and better credit terms from banks because of the \nindependent and third-party analysis of the credit quality of the borrower; (ii) facilitates the \nexpansion of SMEs by increasing their credibility among bankers, customers, and business \nassociates; and (iii) sets benchmarks in credit rating reports for SME credit or lending spread.  \n \n8.  In public\u2013private partnership (PPP) infrastructure financing, the risk components and the \nmethods of assessing a project company differ from the risks and assessment methods usually \nassociated with corporate lending.9 A separate evaluation framework may therefore be needed. \nRatings by DCRAs offer key advantages derived from their (i) knowledge of and information on \nthe government\u2019s policy of pricing flexibility and willingness to intervene in the infrastructure \nsector; (ii) understanding of economic management risk to the state and local governments; \n(iii) dissemination  of  project  company  risk,  which  would  expedite  decisions  by  participating \nfinancial institutions and investors; and (iv) facilitation of bond issues for PPP infrastructure \nprojects. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will contribute to the development of efficient national and regional financial \nsystems with expanding volume and reach in South Asia. Its outcome will be the development \nof national and regional financial markets through increased transparency, accuracy, autonomy, \nand quality of credit rating information provided by DCRAs in the region, as well as more \neffective use of the savings pool to meet the growing financing needs, especially of SME and \nPPP infrastructure projects.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will have five parts: \n(i)  The conduct of country studies in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, \nand Sri Lanka, covering each country\u2019s (a) regulatory framework (current and \npotential significance of DCRAs, role of the credit information bureau, regulation \nand  supervision,  enforcement,  governance  issues)  and  recommended  best \npractice;10 (b) use  of  credit  rating  information  in  SME  financing  (financing \n                                                 \n8  The National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC), the nodal agency for the development of small-scale industry \n(SSI) in India, provides subsidies to entities in the industry to allow them to get a credit rating from credit rating \nagencies or credit rating information companies impaneled with it, such as CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, Fitch, Dun & \nBradstreet, SMERA, and ONICRA. A circular from the Reserve Bank of India has urged banks to consider the \nNSIC scheme. Although commercial banks are not required to give concessions to better-rated entities under the \nNSIC scheme, banks generally give some benefits, especially to those with a higher rating. The number of SSI \nentities rated under the NSIC scheme now total 16,000-\u201317,000. \n9  The risks in PPP infrastructure financing typically pertain to (i) project construction risk, (ii) project implementation \nrisk, (iii) bidders\u2019 risk, and (iv) subcontractors\u2019 risk. The documents used in due diligence are (i) engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contracts; (ii) concession agreements; and (iii) fuel supply and power purchase \nagreements.  \n10 The handbook on international best practice in credit rating in December 2008 prepared under ADB regional TA \nwill be used in the country studies (footnote 5).  \n ", "4   \nframework, methods, government support, constraints, required conditions, and a \ncase study) and policy recommendations; and (c) use of credit rating information \nin PPP infrastructure financing (framework, methods, and government support, \nconstraints, required conditions, and a case study) and policy recommendations. \nThe country study on India will provide a useful and valuable reference to other \nSouth Asian countries in view of India\u2019s advanced regulatory framework and \ninnovative use of credit rating information, and the variety of products of its \nDCRAs, as indicated in recent research reports.11 \n(ii)  On the basis of the country studies, the development of a model framework for \nthe region for (a) the regulation and supervision of DCRAs, (b) the use of credit \nrating information in SME financing, and (c) the use of credit rating information in \nPPP infrastructure financing. \n(iii)  The preparation of books and manuals on credit rating methods for (a) SMEs, \nand (b) PPP infrastructure projects. \n(iv)  The conduct of a South Asia regional forum. \n(v)  The conduct of a workshop in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and \nSri Lanka.  \n \n11.  The regional forum and the country workshops will be held to disseminate the outputs of \nthe  TA  and  to  discuss  current  DCRA  issues  with  regulators  (central  banks  and  securities \nregulators) and with the DCRAs themselves.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $550,000.  It  will  be  financed  with  a  grant  from  the \nInvestment  Climate  Facilitation  Fund 12  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility,  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  This  amount  includes  the \nremuneration, travel expenses, and per diems of the international and national consultants. It \nalso  covers  the  cost  of  the  training  workshops  and  best-practice  dialogues  (including  the \nhonoraria and travel expenses of resource persons); travel expenses, hotel accommodation, \nand subsistence allowances of the participants; and other training expenses such as payment \nfor the venues and training materials. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency. The South Asia Financial Sector, Public Management \nand Trade Division, will implement the TA in coordination with the concerned agencies in each \ncountry. ADB will also collaborate with the Association of Credit Rating Agencies in Asia in \ndisseminating the TA outputs and coordinating the regional forum.  \n \n14.  The TA will require about 6 person-months of international consulting services, to be \nprovided by resource persons (1 person-month) and by specialists in credit rating agencies \n(2.5 person-months), credit rating agency regulation (0.5 person-month), credit rating for SME \nfinancing (1 person-month), and credit rating for PPP infrastructure financing (1 person-month). \n                                                 \n11 Ministry of Finance. 2009.

All consultants and resource persons will be \nselected using the biodata technical proposal. The consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nconsultants will be hired individually because the specialized independent studies in the South \nAsia  countries  require  greater  flexibility  in  sourcing  a  broader  range  of  specialists.  The \ndisbursements  under  the  TA  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook.15 The funds under the TA shall be expended only in ADB member countries. No \nactivities financed under the TA may be held in each country unless ADB receives a no-\nobjection letter from each government. A non-objection letter has been under request to each \ngovernment. The outputs of the TA will be disseminated at the regional forum, the country \nworkshops, and the website of the South Asia Department. The scope of work and outline terms \nof reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility for Best Practice for Regulatory Framework and Use \nof Credit Rating Information of Domestic Credit Rating Agencies in South Asia, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \n                                                 \n13 The national consultants will be hired from among nationals of the country where the country study is to be made.
