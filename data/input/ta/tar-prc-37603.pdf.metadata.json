During  the review  and  update  of the  country  strategy  and  program  for  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC)1 in October 2004, the Government requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to include the Nanjing Qinhuai River Environmental Improvement Project (NQREIP)2 \ninto the lending program, and to provide project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the \nNQREIP.3 A Reconnaissance Mission was conducted in March 2005, and a Fact-Finding Mission \nwas fielded in May 2005. The Mission had discussions with key stakeholders and reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  Nanjing  municipal  government  (NMG)  and  concerned  central  and \nprovincial authorities on the proposed Project\u2019s objectives and scope, and the objectives, outputs, \ncost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA.4    \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nanjing is located on the lower reaches of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River and is the \ncapital of Jiangsu Province. It is an important transportation hub and, due to the city\u2019s long and \ndistinguished history (being the ancient capital of 10 dynasties spanning 450 years), is a cultural \ncenter in eastern PRC. Nanjing is a rapidly developing city with a total population of about 6.5 \nmillion, of whom 4.5 million comprise the urban population. Official data record about 27% of the \npopulation as agriculture-based in 2003 compared with over 50% in 1990, indicating a sizable \nmovement of the population to urban areas. Nanjing comprises 11 districts and 2 counties. Eight \nof the districts now form what is considered the main urban area. The three outlying districts were \nformerly counties that have been upgraded to urban district status in light of recent urbanization \nand future development plans. As in many large PRC cities, rapid economic growth over the past \n20 years has placed increased stress on the environment and city infrastructure. High population \ndensity in the main downtown area has been a constraint to improved livelihood. The current \ntreatment rate of wastewater generated in Nanjing is approximately 66%. \n \n3.  Qinhuai River, referred to as the \u201cmother river\u201d of Nanjing, flows through the urban area \nbefore it joins the Yangtze River. It has a total reach of 110 kilometers (km), with the lower 34 km \npassing through the city\u2019s main urban districts, and has many tributaries. The official water quality \ntarget for the lower Qinhuai River is class V, but currently the river fails to achieve that target by a \nsignificant margin. The high intensity of rainfall has historically caused localized urban flooding in \nsome areas of the city, while the flat topography and lack of natural flow in local watercourses \nresult in stagnant water and the associated health and sanitation problems during the dry periods. \nThe urban poor, including those among the floating population and new migrants, suffer most \nfrom the existing problems of water pollution and flooding.  \n \n4.  NMG has responded to these challenges by making major investments in wastewater \ntreatment, urban drainage, and river channel improvements on local watercourses during the past \n10 years. The city has a well-prepared development plan with a principal planning horizon up to \n2010. The main development objectives of the city are to continue a high and sustainable rate of \neconomic growth as the main means of improving the quality of residents\u2019 livelihood and reducing \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004. People\u2019s Republic of China. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005-2007). Manila: ADB. The \ninclusion of the Project was confirmed during the Country Programming Mission held in April 2005. \n2 Nanjing was nominated as the PRC pilot city for the Water for Asian Cities Program implemented by ADB and the \nUnited Nations Human Settlements Programme (UNHABITAT).  \n3 In addition to the Nanjing Qinhua River Environmental Improvement Project, the Government requested advisory \ntechnical assistance to support corporate bond issue to fund projects to be undertaken by Nanjing Water Services \nGroup Limited, an integrated water and wastewater company to be established. The public and private sector \nactivities supported by ADB will complement each other, but will be prepared and implemented autonomously. \n4 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 16 May 2005. ", "2   \nthe poverty that still exists for some urban and rural residents.5 Growth in gross domestic product \nis needed to provide employment for the continuously migrating population from rural areas to the \nurban areas, as well as from neighboring provinces and cities. NMG has developed plans to meet \nits urban environmental objectives, which it intends to formalize and restate in its 11th City Five-\nYear Plan for 2006\u20132010, currently under preparation.   \n \n5.  The proposed NQREIP will address the above key urban environmental challenges and is \nbeing designed as a natural extension of the investments made in recent years. The rationale is \nto reduce waterborne pollution and urban flood risk in Nanjing, with particular focus on the \nQinhuai River catchment. The Project will improve the urban environment and public health \nthrough better management of wastewater and urban watercourses, and will improve the quality \nof  life  for  the  urban  poor  by  mitigating  health  and  other  risks  from  localized  flooding  and \ninadequate sanitation. \n \n6.  On the basis of discussions with NMG, criteria for the inclusion of project components in \nthe NQREIP were identified.6  After discussions with NMG and project agencies, field visits, and \nwith the objective of achieving maximum developmental impact and value-added from the ADB \ninvestment, the identified subprojects were grouped into four multisector components: municipal \nwastewater management (component A), river system management (component B), stormwater \nmanagement (component C), and sludge management (component D). \n  \n7.  Municipal wastewater management includes construction of 2 extensions to wastewater \ntreatment plants (WWTPs) and 13 sewer system subprojects. The WWTPs are (i) phase 2 East \nWWTP with planned capacity of 100,000 tons/day (t/d), to serve the southeast portion of the \nurban Nanjing area and encompassing the middle section of Outer Qinhuai River; and (ii) phase 2 \nJiangning Science Park WWTP in the new development area of Nanjing with a rapidly growing \npopulation, with a planned capacity of 40,000 t/d. This component includes construction of 130 \nkm of dedicated wastewater sewers and the associated secondary branches, which will intercept \nsewage and convey it to the prospective WWTPs; and five dual-purpose pumping stations.  \n \n8.  River system management includes (i) flow augmentation, (ii) bank stabilization and \nerosion control, (iii) water replenishing, and (iv) construction of an urban wetland area. Nanjing \nhas relatively low ground elevation and many rivers, canals, and other waterways; therefore, flood \ncontrol has been an important task. Historically Qinhuai River\u2019s tributaries were interconnected \nwith sufficient flow capacities. Through years of siltation and improperly managed development \nactivities, flows from these waterways have been greatly reduced and at several locations are \ncompletely blocked. This component is expected to restore the flood control function of the \nwaterways and facilitate their self-purification functions. \n \n9.  Stormwater management includes the construction and/or renovation of seven pumping \nstations, construction of 80 km of stormwater discharge pipes, and evaluation of improvements to \nthe  current  centralized  stormwater  management  center.  Because  of  relatively  low  ground \nelevations, the city\u2019s stormwater management relies solely on reliable pumping stations and \nwaterways with sufficient flow capacities. Localized floods are almost certain to occur several \n                                                 \n5 The overall percentage of population receiving assistance is about 2%. The basic welfare system for protection from \npoverty is the \u201cminimum living standard scheme\u201d, and at present some 72,000 urban residents are registered for \nsupplementary assistance under this scheme. There are no specific areas where poor people are concentrated; \nrather, they are scattered throughout the city.  \n6 These included (i) strong link to the overall project rationale, (ii) maximum social impact, (iii) least resettlement impact, \n(iv) timeliness of proposed works in relation to the indicative NQREIP implementation schedule, and (v) preparation \nstatus and readiness to participate. In addition, the results of the diagnostic study of Nanjing\u2019s water and wastewater \nsector prepared under the Water for Asian Cities initiative have been used for identifying potential projects. ", "       3         \ntimes a year without the pumping stations. The purpose of this component is to develop a reliable \nand effective flood management system that allows all stations to work in a coordinated manner \nand prevent situations of simply transferring floods to other areas.  \n \n10.  Sludge management will evaluate the treatment and disposal options for the sludge \ngenerated from operations of the Nanjing\u2019s WWTPs (including those to be constructed under \ncomponent  A)  and  the  river  dredging  activities  (that  form  part  of  component  B).  Sludge \nmanagement will develop the overall least-cost alternative for sludge disposal to a stage that can \nbe readily implemented. Currently NMG believes that a dedicated sludge disposal landfill is the \noptimum solution, but it needs to be further reviewed during the TA.  \n \n11.  Capacity-building initiatives including managerial and information system improvements, \ntogether with technology and knowledge transfers, will increase the value added of the TA and \nthe ensuing project. The TA consultants will study and give advice to NMG on (i) wastewater \ninstitutional  arrangements;  (ii)  improvements  in  sewerage  operations,  including  possible \nupgrading  of  geographic  information  systems  (GIS);  (iii)  improved  management  of  flood \nalleviation and water flows in the local river system; and (iv) other policy and reform issues. \n \n12.  The project objectives are similar to those of the successfully implemented Suzhou Creek \nRehabilitation Project. Several other ongoing ADB projects including those in Anhui, Fujian, \nHebei, and Hubei provinces, feature pollution control initiatives. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country strategy and with the Government\u2019s objectives in the urban, social, and water \nsectors.  \n \n13.  During the review and identification of the project components, several policy-related \nissues  were  discussed,  including  integrated  environmental  approaches  and  solutions,  and \neconomically sound investments. As a result, component D was included in the project scope, \nand  the  scope  of  component  A  was  revised.  Other  policy  discussions  evolved  around  the \ninstitutional setup of the water and wastewater sector and proposed reforms, the flow of funds in \nthe sector, the tariffs and financial sustainability of the enterprises, and the potential for private \nsector involvement. The preliminary total cost of the project is CNY2,033 million ($246 million), of \nwhich the proposed ADB loan is estimated at $100 million. \n \n14.  During the preparation of the TA, NMG and ADB reviewed the lessons learned from other \nTAs funded by ADB in the PRC and other countries, and how that experience can best be \nincorporated in the TA. Feasibility study (FS) reports commissioned by implementing agencies \n(IAs) and prepared by domestic design institutes (DIs) provide the foundation for the TA work, \nfurther project preparation, and loan approval by the national and ADB authorities. However, \nthese FSs often do not fully meet their purpose. Para. 17 describes the modified arrangement for \nthe TA to ensure the quality of FSs at entry. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The TA will prepare an investment project suitable for ADB financing that will facilitate \neconomic development, improve environment and quality of life in Nanjing through extended and \nimproved wastewater treatment and sewerage infrastructure, river system management, and \nmitigation of flood risks. The TA will help NMG establish the technical, economic, financial, social, \nand environmental justification of the proposed project and prepare plans in compliance with \nADB\u2019s safeguard policies. In addition, the TA will assist NMG on policy issues and required \n ", "4   \ncapacity building, and will review the proposed project implementation arrangements. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1, and the initial poverty and social analysis is in \nAppendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will review and analyze the medium- and long-term sector plans for wastewater \nand environmental management in Nanjing municipality, in the context of broader integrated \nwater resources management and the Nanjing urban development plan. Changes in the sector \nplans will be recommended to make them more responsive to the development objectives of \nNanjing,  and  to  provide  an  improved  water  environment  to  its  residents,  particularly  the \nvulnerable groups. The scope of works included in the proposed project will be analyzed in the \ncontext of both the Nanjing urban development plan and sector policies. The individual project \ncomponents  and  viable  alternative  solutions  will  be  analyzed  in  detail  to  establish  project \njustification  based  on  least-cost  criteria,  and  to  minimize  adverse  environmental  and  social \nimpacts. The justification process will follow relevant ADB and national guidelines. The TA will \ndevelop measurement of baseline health and environment indicators for future monitoring of \nNQREIP benefits.  \n \n17.  On the basis of (i) discussions with NMG, the proposed IAs and DIs; and (ii) review of \nsome  existing  FSs,  the  current  capacity  of  IAs  and  DIs  to  produce  the  required  FSs  was \nassessed, and the project team prepared an outline terms of reference (TOR) tailored to the FSs \nfor the proposed project components. Two workshops on ADB policies and procedures, and in \nparticular on FS requirements and TA procedures were held for the Executing Agency, IAs, and \nDIs. The IAs agreed to utilize this outline TOR in procuring project preparatory work from the DIs. \nNMG agreed to ensure that the FSs are undertaken in accordance with the proposed TOR to the \nextent possible to ensure good quality FSs and smooth TA implementation. Close coordination \nbetween  the  TA  consultants  and  the  DIs  will  enhance  their  capacity  to  undertake  FSs  in \naccordance with international standards.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $800,000 equivalent, comprising $432,000 in \nforeign exchange and $368,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested that \nADB  finance  $600,000  equivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $168,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government has agreed to provide the balance of the local currency cost, \nequivalent to $200,000, for counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative support, and \nlogistics, as well as financing the preparation of FSs, environmental impact assessments, and \nresettlement plans. Details of the cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  NMG will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  A project leading group, chaired by the \nvice mayor of NMG, was formed to provide overall guidance and support to project preparation. It \nincludes directors of Nanjing Municipal Construction Commission (NMCC), Nanjing Municipal \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NMDRC), Nanjing Municipal Finance Bureau (NMFB), \nNanjing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau (NMEPB), Nanjing Municipal Public Utilities \nBureau (NMPUB), and a Jiangning district representative. A project management office (PMO) ", "       5         \nwill be established within the NMCC. The director of the NMCC will be the director of the PMO. \nThe  PMO  will  ensure  interdepartmental  coordination  and  the  TA  team\u2019s  access  to  reports, \ninformation,  and  data  needed  for  the  effective  conduct  of  the  TA.  The  PMO  will  also  be \nresponsible for liaising with ADB during preparation of NQREIP. The vice director of NMCC will \nbe  the  PMO  executive  deputy  director.  The  PMO  will  include  representatives  from  NMCC, \nNMDRC,  NMFB,  NMEPB,  NMPUB,  Nanjing  Construction  Investment  Corporation  (NCIC), \nJiangning district, and others as may be necessary to facilitate TA activities. One experienced \nand qualified PMO staff member will work full-time for the TA and will work closely with the \nconsulting team.  \n \n20.  The Mission discussed with NMG the basic principles for identifying and selecting IAs. \nBased on the criteria, five IAs were confirmed: Nanjing Municipal Water Company, Qinhuai River \nConstruction Development Company, Jiangning Water Company, Nanjing Drainage Management \nDivision, and Nanjing Municipal Engineering Construction Division.  \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 7 months, from approximately November 2005 to June \n2006. A total of 46.5 person-months of consulting services will be provided: 18.5 international and \n28  domestic.  International  and  domestic  consultants  will  provide  expertise  in  municipal  and \nriver/hydraulics engineering, social analysis and resettlement, environmental impact assessment, \nand financial, economic, and institutional analyses. ADB will engage an international consulting \nfirm, in association with domestic consultants, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The \nquality- and cost-based selection method and simplified technical proposal procedure will be \nused. The outline TOR for consulting services is in Appendix 4. Equipment provided under the TA \nfor consulting services will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n22.  The consultants will prepare inception, interim, draft final, and final reports, and improve \nand modify the resettlement plans and prepare summary environmental impact assessment in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  Workshops  attended  by  a  broad  group  of  project \nstakeholders, and tripartite review meetings involving NMG, ADB, and the consultants will be held \nto guide the consultants and to review their reports. The consulting team will coordinate closely \nwith the consulting team for the TA to support a potential corporate bond issue to fund projects to \nbe undertaken by Nanjing Water Services Group Limited, whose subsidiaries include at least one \nof the project IAs. Close coordination on information and activities will take place in strengthening \nthe managerial and institutional capacities of the company, improving efficiency of its operations, \nand other capacity-building measures.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  preparing  the  Nanjing  Qinhuai  River \nEnvironmental Improvement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicatorsa  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nEnhanced  Percentage of water  Official NMG statistics   \u2022  Project design is \nenvironmental  bodies in the project    implemented effectively. \nprotection, economic  area meet target levels  Nanjing EPB monitoring   \ndevelopment, and  by 2010.  data  \u2022  ADB and the Government \nimproved quality of life      sign loan agreement. \nin Nanjing   Percentage of  Socioeconomic surveys   \n  waterborne diseases,  and project data  \u2022  Applicable national and \nand the associated    local environmental laws \naverage number of  Nanjing public health  and regulations are \nsickdays at the  department statistics  enforced.  \nworkplace decreased   \nfrom 2005 to 2015. \n \nPercentage of people \nliving in flood-prone \nareas decreased from \n2005 to 2015. \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nProject design and  Memorandum of  ADB loan fact-finding and  \u2022  Effective stakeholder \nfeasibility studies (FSs)  Understanding signed  appraisal missions;  participation and sense of \nagreed upon by the  by the Government and  Management Review and  ownership are developed. \nGovernment and ADB  ADB during loan fact- Staff Review Committee   \nfinding and/or appraisal  Meetings  Risks \nmissions scheduled for     \nmid-2006  Memorandum of  \u2022  Government plans \nUnderstanding  change. \n \n\u2022  The Government decides \nto seek alternative \nfunding. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
