For  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  digital  finance  creates  new  enablers  for \ndevelopment impact and poverty alleviation at the macro, meso, and micro levels of the financial \nsector as well as the numerous crosscutting development themes across the ecosystem. ADB \ncan assist in various ways. In the private sector, ADB can support digital finance by profiling \nchampions and identifying funding opportunities that promote financial inclusion. In the public \nsector,  ADB  can  help  conceptualize  pilot  projects  for  government-to-person  projects,  and \ncrucially assist governments as they craft fair and effective regulations that enable growth. Such \nadvancement through financing and pilot projects, as well as improvement and implementation \nof regulation, will directly benefit all users of digital finance although specifically women; micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs); and the base of the pyramid1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Digital finance, financial technology, and mobile money have been emerging areas of \ninterest for ADB and other multilateral development banks, both for public sector and private \nsector  operations.2 These  areas  have  enormous  reach  and  interconnections  with  other \ntechnological  themes  such  as  \u201cbig  data\u201d3 and  \u201cthe  internet  of  things\u201d4 as  well  as  with \ninfrastructure development. Digital finance will play a defining role in the future of the financial \nsector  globally.  Innovation  is  paving  the  way  for  new  applications  of  managing  financial \ntransactions, encompassing trade, e-commerce, supply chain, loans, and investments.5 The \nprivate sector is at the heart of this change, given the valuable assets that are at stake - such as \ncustomer revenues, influence, and data.6 Most banks, to varying degrees, are embracing bank \n2.0 or bank 3.0 approaches that develop product offerings and core banking systems to meet \nevolving customer habits and/or preferences. Banks are also keen to ward off attacks from \nyounger, more flexible, and targeted financial technology companies or \u201cfintechs\u201d that specialize \nin developing highly effective technology to create alternative finance modalities for customers7. \nBanks also must compete with or partner with mobile network operators (MNOs) that have an \ninfrastructure and distribution advantage to build payment systems into their mobile proposition8. \nHowever, MNOs are often not licensed for activities in the finance sector, giving opportunity for \nstrategic partnership for financial institutions. However, these new modalities affect the risk \nprofile  of  financial  transactions.  Global,  regional,  and  local  regulators,  central  banks,  and \npoliticians  are  watching  the  developments  in  global  financial  technology  with  an  eye  on \nbalancing progress and innovation with prudent risk control. \n \n                                                \n1  The largest but poorest socioeconomic group in a society.

Key to ADB\u2019s interest in digital finance is the pivotal role it can play in financial inclusion \nand  inclusive  finance.  In  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific  alone,  about  490  million  people  were \nunbanked in 2014.9 Many of these people live remotely and/or rurally. Owing to unequal access \nto infrastructure, made worse by low financial literacy and onerous know-your-customer and \nloan application requirements from financial institutions, this population are excluded from basic \nfinancial services. While the majority of the unbanked and underbanked population lacks regular \naccess to the internet, mobile phones with MNO prepaid SIM (subscriber identity module) card \nare almost universal. Although this is not a substitute to a formal bank account, it is a key \nenabler  for  financial  inclusion  given  its  vast  distribution  network  (2.5  billion  of  the  world\u2019s \n4.3 billion mobile phone users are in Asia and the Pacific,10 including 1.6 billion smartphone \nusers).11 The crosscutting ecosystem benefits that build off of a network of mobile financial \ntechnology must also be considered for its development potential. Kenya\u2019s M-Pesa is an oft-\nquoted example of the effect of crowding in education, health care, and other applications \nacross the M-Pesa ecosystem through application programming interface (API) technology.12 \nADB notes three specific beneficiaries that have outsized potential for financial inclusion as a \nresult of digital finance - women, the base of the pyramid, and MSMEs. \n \n4.  Regulation, demand, awareness, infrastructure, technical understanding, education, and \nother  supply  considerations  all  affect  the  growth  of  the  digital  finance  market.  High  initial \ninvestments  but  low  near-term  returns,  high  customer  dropout  rates,  issues  related  to \ninteroperability, and building critical agent networks, prevent growth. ADB can have a multi-\npronged approach to building capacity in digital finance. ADB\u2019s non-sovereign operations can \njoin other development investors by providing capital and technical assistance (TA) to private \nsector champions (both banks and nonbank technology companies \u2018fintechs\u2019) that are driving \nchange and financial inclusion for key segments. ADB\u2019s sovereign operations can assist by \nconceptualizing  pilot  projects  with  government  stakeholders  such  as  government-to-person \npayments, as a way to improve transparency, governance and reducing transaction costs. \nCrucially, ADB is well positioned to help tackle regulation\u2014a key challenges (or enabler), with \nwide impact across the ecosystem. Regulation is pivotal for private sector operators to scale up \noperations and drive financial inclusion. Fair and well-crafted regulations are essential as they \ngive comfort and trust to the market. They create a level playing field for companies to calculate \nrisk\u2014facilitating growth that will create financial inclusion. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n5.  The TA will have two components: a \u201cOne ADB\u201d public and private sector product \nfocused on regulation, and a Private Sector Financial Institutions Division (PSFI)-only market \nscoping and investment building process that will run in parallel to the \u201cOne ADB\u201d product. \n \n6.

Output  2:  Private  Sector  Financial  Institutions  Division  investment  pipeline \ndevelopment. A separate PSFI-only market scoping and investment-building process will run in \nconjunction with output 1. Under the TA, PSFI will employ an individual consultant to build on \nthe  value  chain  analysis  conducted  in  output  1.  Output  2  will  identify  and  analyze  risks \nassociated with specific financial technology transactions in countries included in the report. The \nconsultant will identify target segments and companies fit to ADB\u2019s investment value proposition \nin debt and equity.  \n \n9.  Justification. The digital finance space is moving incredibly fast, and governments need \ntime to embrace and understand new technology\u2014creating a regulatory lag. Bridging the gap \nbetween technology innovation and government decision making is vital. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  impact  is  aligned  with  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  that  target \nproductive activities, job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage \nthe formalization and growth of MSMEs, including through access to financial services. The \nSDGs target a reduction in the number of unbanked people (SDG 1.4: By 2030, to ensure that \nall men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have access to financial services). \n \n11.  The outcome will be for ADB investments in digital finance, financial technology, and \nmobile banking to be rolled out following the PSFI investment pipeline being identified and the \nregulatory road maps outlining preconditions for the development of an enabling environment \nfor digital financial technology developed for each country.  \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).14 \n  \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will be executed and implemented by ADB, with PSOD as the focal point. ADB, \nthrough PSOD, will be responsible for all technical implementation issues. The TA activities \nunder output 1 will be implemented with the help of an international consulting firm with strong \nbranding and will be a firm with proven experience in the area of digital finance both in the \npublic and private sectors. The firm will also have experience developing knowledge papers, \nfinancial technology databases, and specific engagements on both public policy development \nand financial technology. Output 1 will require 7.5 person-months of international consultant \nservices.  \n                                                \n13 Regional considerations will also be taken into account. This may require additional funding to identify, for \nexample, remittance flows from country to country and regulation harmonization across governments. \n14 Certain outputs under this TA will be linked to those under the ADB. 2013.

Ouput 2 will be linked to this TA. \n ", "4   \n17.  Consultants for output 1 will be engaged via the consultants\u2019 qualifications selection \nprocess in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time), as they require specific skills. For output 2, the consultant will be engaged via \nindividual consultants selection process in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Outputs 1 will be \nimplemented over 12 months from the start date (January\u2013March 2016), for completion in April\u2013\nDecember 2016. Output2 1 will be implemented over 36 months from the start date (January\u2013\nMarch 2016), for completion in April\u2013December 2018. \n \n18.  Both the consulting firm and the individual consultant will provide ADB with TA progress \nreports at the midterm point of their respective engagements, which outline the status of TA \nimplementation in addition to a final TA report. Pursuant to Article 14(iii) of the ADB Charter,15 \nthe applicable developing member country's government's no objection to the implementation of \nthe TA in the relevant country will be established before the implementation or financing of the \nTA in that country. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nPromoting Financial Inclusion through Financial Technology, and hereby reports this action to \nthe  Board.\n                                                \n15 ADB 1966.
