INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Uzbekistan is committed to strengthening governance, increasing \ntransparency and accountability of government, and ensuring results-based delivery of public \nservices. The government has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to further \naccelerate its own e-government initiatives. The TA was discussed with the government and \nconfirmed in a memorandum of understanding signed in November 2012.1 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Uzbekistan has taken significant steps toward increasing its online presence and is \nranked second among countries in Central Asia by the 2012 survey on e-government.2 While its \nglobal ranking among 190 countries remains in the middle range, its score increased by 13.3% \nin 2012, reflecting impacts of legislative changes adopted in 2007 and 2009 and significant \ninitiatives launched under phase 1 of the national information and communication technology \n(ICT) strategy.  \n \n3.  National  information  and  communication  technology  strategy.  The  government \nlaunched  the  strategy  in  2002. 3  Achievements  include  establishment  of  an  institutional \nframework for ICT implementation, nationwide public and government connectivity, preparation \nof an e-government master plan, and implementation of diverse ICT applications and pilot \ninitiatives including expansion of software and hardware for public financial management4 and \neducation5 undertaken with ADB support.  \n \n4.  Phase 2 of the strategy was initiated in March 2012.6 The main objectives of phase 2 are \nto expand government ICT applications and improve their integration, increase public access to \ngovernment information, and improve government transparency and accountability. Phase 2 \n(2012\u20132014) includes a broad set of ICT activities including assessment and pilot start ups, and \nphased  implementation  of  major  initiatives.  The  strategic  list  of  ICT  applications  support \nadvancement of economic growth and private sector development,7 effective public financial \nmanagement,8 needs-based  delivery  of  social  services,9 and  more  accountable  delivery  of \npublic services.10 The next steps are to develop, in coordination with the respective client \nagencies,  detailed  plans  for  implementation  of  each  programmed  ICT  activity  based  on \nconfirmed resource commitments. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 November 2012. \n2  The Government Portal of the Republic of Uzbekistan. http://www.gov.uz/en/; United Nations. 2012.

E-government master plan. An in-depth assessment of the ICT policy and legislative \nframework  and  ICT  readiness  across  the  government  (in  terms  of  ICT  infrastructure  and \ncapacity) has been undertaken. An e-government master plan was prepared, comprising a road \nmap, implementation plan, and consolidated list of ICT applications across key government \nagencies. The ICT activities selected for phase 2 were prioritized from the e-government master \nplan. Of these, ADB support has been requested for assistance in online property registration, \nsingle-window business registration, e-procurement, and expanding the government portal to \nincrease  access  to  public  information  and  enable  greater  interactive  public  exchange  on \ngovernment programs and services.11 ADB support is sought to build upon global experiences \nand  best  practice,  particularly  the  models  in  Japan  and  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  e-\ngovernment results in Armenia and Georgia that have been developed with ADB support. \n \n6.  Property  registration.  According to the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2012 report, \nregistering property in Uzbekistan requires 12 procedures, takes 78 days, and costs 0.9% of the \nproperty  value.12 To  simplify  and  streamline  the  registration  process,  the  government  has \nprioritized development of a computerized land registry to enable online title registration through \na single window. Integration with collateral registries and credit information systems will reduce \ntime requirements for credit evaluation, and support more effective portfolio risk management. \nCoordination  with  the  Housing  for  Integrated  Rural  Development  Investment  Program,13 \nimplemented with ADB support, offers synergy with finance sector policy development and a \nbasis for a nationwide pilot.14 \n \n7.  Business registration. Private sector development is important to ensure sustainable \nand inclusive economic growth, particularly in rural areas where micro and small enterprises \n(MSEs) account for 50%\u201380% of employment. The government reports that the private sector \ncontributes 82.5% of total gross domestic product, with MSEs accounting for 54% of gross \ndomestic product and more than 75.1% of employment nationally. A program of measures to \nimprove the legal, regulatory, and enabling environment for private sector development and \npromote MSE expansion and employment was launched in 2011\u2014the Year of Small Business \nand  Private  Entrepreneurship.  Doing  Business  2012  advises  that  starting  a  business  in \nUzbekistan is now easier with lower capital requirements, reduced procedures, and reduced \ncost of registration (footnote 12). \n \n8.  To  further  improve  the  business  environment  and  advance  MSE  development,  an \nadditional set of reforms was initiated in July 2012.15 The 3-year program (2012\u20132014) was \ndeveloped  in  consultation  with  the  Uzbekistan  Chamber  of  Commerce,  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank. The program prioritizes actions to \nincrease transparency of regulatory and procedural requirements for business registration and \noperation,  and  further  simplify  and  reduce  administrative  barriers.  Under  this  program  the \nlaunching  of  an  online  single  window  business  registration  process,  and  online  access  to \n                                                \n11 Letter from first deputy prime minister and minister of finance dated 19 September 2012, and letter from deputy \nminister of finance and head of treasury dated 24 October 2012. \n12 World Bank. 2011.

Public  procurement.  To  achieve  greater  transparency  and  accountability  for  public \nprocurement,  a  new  law  is  being  drafted  to  provide  a  unified  legal  framework  for  public \nprocurement.  An  e-procurement  feasibility  study  has  been  undertaken  and  selected \ne-procurement components and pilot initiatives launched. All public procurement is posted on \nthe government portal at  least  30  days  in  advance  of  supplier  selection,  and  through  the \ncommodity exchange an electronic bidding system is operated for procurement of public goods \nand services valued at more than $300 and less than $100,000. The online auction system \noffers  increased  transparency  and  enables  small  businesses  to  participate  in  public \nprocurement. Further development and nationwide rollout of the e-procurement system requires \nadditional policy work and development of procedures in accordance with the new law. A unified \nend-to-end  e-procurement  system  that  addresses  the  full  range  of  public  procurement \nrequirements will require phased development and pilot tests prior to nationwide implementation.   \n \n10.  Public access to information. Since its establishment in 2003, the government portal \nhas  rapidly  evolved  from  a  purely  informative  website  with  limited  links  to  a  more \ncomprehensive and interactive one. Features include (i) access to multilingual (Uzbek, Russian, \nand English) information on the roles of national, regional, and local governments, and functions \nof executive and line ministries; (ii) access with search functions to public archives of laws, \ndecrees, and government orders; (iii) access to downloadable forms; and (iv) access to audio, \nvideo, and other web-feed formats. Improved and expanded structure, regular updates, and \ngreater integration is required to provide citizens and businesses with access to information on \ngovernment programs, improve transparency of government delivery of public services, and \nenable greater public participation in government processes.  \n \n11.  Government  coordination  and  technical  oversight.  To  address  institutional \nchallenges of government-wide implementation of the national ICT strategy, a coordination \ncommittee for development of computerization and ICT has been established. The committee is \nmandated to oversee the prioritization of e-government applications and the development of a \n3-year  investment  plan  (2012\u20132014).  The  Ministry  of  Economy  is  the  lead  agency  with \nresponsibility for coordinating e-government financing and implementation plans across the \ngovernment and inclusion of these plans in national investment plans.  \n \n12.  The committee also oversees e-government design and implementation. The committee \nis supported by Uzinfocom, a technical agency established to ensure effective integration of e-\ngovernment software and hardware platforms, and information security of all e-government \napplications. With its network of regional offices and district focal points, Uzinfocom provides \noperational and technical information technology (IT) support across the government. Extensive \nstakeholder consultations and capacity development of technical agencies and client or end \nuser agencies will be critical success factors for the e-government initiatives.  \n  \n13.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  Uzbekistan  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016 \napproved in September 2012.16 The TA also supports its objectives promoting governance, \ninstitutional  improvement,  and  capacity  development.

Manila. \n17 Since 2001, UNDP has been significantly involved in developing an enabling ICT legal and policy framework and \npromoting e-government. With the Chamber of Commerce, work has proceeded on e-commerce, e-banking, and \nan e-digital signature. Support has also been provided for e-taxation, automation of customs administration, and \nenvironmental and geographic information system applications. \n ", "4   \ndevelopment agencies of the Republic of Korea,18 are also providing extensive support for the \ndevelopment and implementation of the government\u2019s ICT strategy and e-government initiatives. \nADB is working with this group and continued coordination will be critical to ensure synergy, \nmore effective delivery of public services, and accelerated development. \n \nIII.
