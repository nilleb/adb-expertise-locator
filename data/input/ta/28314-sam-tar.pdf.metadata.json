INTRODUCTION\n1. In November 1994, the Government of Western Samoa requested the Bank for\ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare a proposed Urban Development Project. The Bank Mission\nthat visited Western Samoa in October 1995, held discussions with Treasury Department; the\nDepartment of Lands, Survey and the Environment (DLSE); and other Government agencies; and\nreached an understanding on the objectives, scope, cost, and other aspects of the TA.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The two principal islands of Western Samoa are Upolu and Savai'i. The capital,\nApia, is located on the north coast of Upolu and has a population of about 35,000 people, which\nis about 21 percent of the national population. The town of Salelologa and its neighboring\nvillages on the east coast of Savai'i have a population of about 12,000 people. The urban\npopulation growth rate has slowed recently, as a result of emigration to New Zealand, American\nSamoa, Australia, and United States.\n3. Western Samoa's social structure is based on extended families and village\ncommunities. Much of the country's land is under customary ownership. However, in Apia, about\ntwo thirds of the land is freehold, with much being owned by churches. The rest is customary\nland, or land owned by the Government and administered by the DLSE. The Western Samoa\nLand Corporation administers significant areas of state-owned land on the urban fringes.\n4. The country's economy is beginning to recover from the effects of two devastating\ncyclones in 1990 and 1991 and a pest (Taro blight) that affected its major crop. 2 Agriculture is\nthe mainstay of the economy, supported by remittances and international assistance. The\ncountry's gross domestic product (GDP), currently about $1 ,000 per capita, declined between\n1990 and 1992 as a result of the cyclones and crop damage. The high growth rate in GDP of\n6 percent in 1993 was followed by a contraction in 1994.\n5. Apia is the country's principal port and accounts for more than 90 percent of the\ncountry's paid employment. It is the center of the country's small, growing tourist industry and\nis also the center for manufacturing, distribution, and Government services, which together\naccount for about 40 percent of GDP. The center of the city is located on low lying, swampy\nland formed by the estuaries of two rivers. The location was selected during the last century as\nthe site of European settlement, and its central location and natural harbor have stimulated urban\ngrowth. Public works were initiated during German administration late last century, and were\ncontinued during the New Zealand administration from 1914 to 1956. Investments in\ninfrastructure have continued since the country gained independence in 1962.\n6. While development has spread into the valleys and onto the hillsides behind the\nthe center of the city, the natural environment continues to present challenges in the provision\nof urban services. Deficiencies in drainage and sanitation cause flooding and pollute the\ngroundwater and the marine environment. Inadequate solid waste disposal contributes to the\ndegradation of the environment. The unsafe and irregular water supply exacerbates the\nsubstandard living conditions of the urban poor.3 A Government Task Force identified the urban\nThe TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in April 1995.\nThe Bank has assisted in the recovery with Loan No.1993-SAM(SF) Cyclone-Damage Rehabilitation, for\n$8.64 million, approved on 19 November 1992.\nWater supply, sanitation, drainage and solid waste management deficiencies have been highlighted in\nManaging Urban Environmental Sanitation in Selected Pacific Island Countries, The World Bank, February\n1995.", "2\ndevelopment issues during the preparation of the National Environmental and Development\nManagement Strategy (NEMS) for the Government.1\n7. Several Government agencies are responsible for planning, financing and\nproviding urban infrastructure support services including (i) the Treasury, for coordination of\ninternational assistance and for budgeting and finance; (ii) DLSE for maintenance of land\nregisters, topographical information, environmental planning and assessment including the\ncoordination of NEMs, and solid waste management; (iii) the Water Authority for water supply\nand sewerage services; (iv) the Public Works Department (PWD) for roads, stormwater drainage,\npreparation of building codes, and assessment of building standards; (v) the Visitor's Bureau for\ntourism development; (vi) the Traffic Control Board and the Ministry of Transport for traffic\nplanning and management; and (vii) the Health Department for noise, air emission, and general\nhealth standards. The Government has proposed that an Urban Authority be established to\ncoordinate the planning and provision of services. The draft legislation is being prepared now.\n8. In 1992, the Government directed that urban development planning should be a\nfunction of DLSE and a Bank-financed housing sector study2 recommended that urban planning\nshould be institutionalized within DLSE. However, the recommendation in the housing sector\nstudy needs to be complemented by a more detailed study of institutional measures to improve\nurban planning. Earlier PWD had prepared urban land use zoning plans, which are used for\nguidance; but have not been formally adopted by Government.\n9. Apia's water supply system, which was upgraded in 1989 with assistance from\nGermany, Saudi Arabia, and New Zealand, covers most of the urban area. However,\nunconstrained consumption has caused demand to exceed supply.3 Direct cost recovery from\nconsumers amounts to less than 20 percent of the Water Authority's operational costs. The\nEuropean Union has provided assistance for a national water tariff study. It is proposed that\nwater metering, with new water tariffs, will be introduced in 1996 during the implementation of\na proposed European Union financed rural water supply project.\n10. A drainage master plan has been prepared and drainage improvements, to meet\nthe immediate needs were completed with assistance from Germany in 1991. However, the\ndrainage system needs to be maintained. The blocked drains contribute to the flooding of low\nlying areas in the center of the city during the rainy season, which extends from December to\nApril. Development in the low lying areas is also intensifying and worsening the problem.\n11. Apia has no central sewerage system. The houses are served by septic tanks,\npour-flush latrines, or pit latrines. Effluent from these facilities often discharges to the nearest\nopen drain. Some industrial and commercial establishments discharge untreated wastes into\nthe ground or into streams and open drains, contributing to the pollution identified in the NEMS\nof the ground, surface, and coastal waters.\n12. Apia's solid wastes are collected in open trucks operated by private contractors\nengaged by DLSE. The wastes are taken to a refuse disposal site west of the city. The\nA State of the Environment Report and a National Environment and Development Strategy document have\nbeen prepared with assistance from the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme and United Nations\nDevelopment Programme.\nTA No. 1332-SAM, Housing Sector Study, for $350,000, approved on 5 June 1990.\nDemand currently exceeds 450 liters per capita per day (lcd) in contrast to level with a more usual per capita\ndemand of 100 to 200 lcd; see the Bank's Water Utilities Data Book.", "3\ncompaction and cover of the deposited wastes is poor. A solid waste disposal site in a coastal\nmangrove swamp, formally closed in 1992, is still used on an informal basis by local residents.\nCasual dumping of rubbish contributes to the blockage of drains in the central area of the city.\n13. Since 1990, several road and traffic management improvements in the urban areas\nin Apia have been completed by PWD, with assistance from Australia. However, local areas of\ntraffic congestion remain associated with market and public transport activities. Only limited\nprovision has been made for pedestrians' requirements.\n14. As recognized in the NEMS and other studies, immediate efforts are required to\nimprove urban services because economic growth will continue to encourage steady\nurbanization. Improved urban planning and carefully controlled urban development is required\nif the degradation of the urban environment is not to reach serious proportions. Several policy\nissues need to be addressed, such as improving the coordination of the planning for the\nprovision of urban development and services, selecting appropriate and affordable levels of\nservice, and implementing demand management measures, and cost recovery. Improvements\nin these areas will support the Bank's strategy for Western Samoa, which includes strengthening\nthe country's institutional capacity, improving the environment, and providing social infrastructure\nby improving the urban areas.\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n15. The objectives of the TA are (i) to identify and recommend policy, legislative, and\ninstitutional improvements to ensure the sustainability of integrated urban planning and\ndevelopment; (ii) to identify and prioritize the urban development needs of Western Samoa; and\n(iii) to prepare a feasibility study for a first-stage urban development project (the Project) as\nidentified from the prioritized development needs.\nB.\t Scope\n16. The TA will take into account the rate of population growth, the degree of\nurbanization, the socioeconomic conditions and cultural characteristics of the urban population,\nthe current level of urban infrastructure, and the future demand for services. The TA will be\norganized into two phases. Phase I will include a review of planning policies and practices, and\nof the institutional framework for urban planning. Recommendations will be made for policy\nreforms, an improved institutional framework, and improved coordination of urban planning and\ndevelopment. An urban strategy and flexible urban structure plans will be developed, and a\nprioritized program of urban development improvements, which can be carried out in stages, will\nbe prepared and will form the basis for an investment package that will be identified in\nPhase II. Technical, economic, and financial feasibility studies will be prepared. Socioeconomic\nevaluation and public participation will form an important part of both phases, and an initial\nenvironmental examination or an environmental impact assessment, if warranted, will be carried\nout.\n17. The TA will cover institutional strengthening, urban planning, social dimensions,\nurban roads and traffic management, solid waste management, water supply, urban drainage,\nsanitation and wastewater management strategy, and operation and maintenance of urban\nservices and facilities. The Government's existing urban planning practices and regulations will\nbe reviewed, and recommendations for improvements will be made. Social dimensions will", "4\ninclude the identification of beneficiary groups and their socioeconomic profiles, preferences for\naccess to infrastructure, and willingness and ability to pay for services. Participatory workshops\nwill be conducted. A system for monitoring and evaluating the benefits of the Project will be\nprepared.\n18. A prioritized program for urban road improvement, rehabilitation, and repair will\nbe prepared, taking into account projected increases in urban traffic, pedestrian access, and\nrequirements for routing water distribution pipelines, drainage channels, sewers, electric power\ncables, telephone cables, and other urban services. Resource requirements for an appropriate\nstandard of road maintenance will be assessed.\n19. The solid waste management studies will identify deficiencies of, and necessary\nimprovements to, solid waste collection and disposal capability and capacity. A solid waste\nmanagement strategy will be prepared and operation and management improvements will be\nrecommended.\n20. A review of urban water consumption and demand levels will be carried out and\nproposals for demand management will be reviewed. Recommendations will be made for the\nimplementation of demand management measures. The condition of urban water distribution\nsystems and requirements for water treatment at unprotected spring water sources will be\nreviewed. The extent and condition of urban stormwater drainage will be reviewed, and a\ndrainage improvement strategy will be developed. Proposals for urban piped sewerage systems\nwill be reviewed and low-cost, low technology alternatives will be assessed. A sanitation and\nwastewater management strategy, including an immediate action plan, will be prepared.\n21. Institutional strengthening measures will be prepared to improve the organizational\nand management capability of Government agencies responsible for the planning, delivery,\noperation, management, and maintenance of urban services. Particular attention will be given\nto financial management, tariff structures, and cost recovery mechanisms. The proposal to create\nan urban authority will be reviewed and proposals for improved coordination of urban planning\nand the provision, operation, and maintenance of urban services will be recommended.\nRecommendations and proposals will be made for improving the routine maintenance of urban\ninfrastructure.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n22. The total cost of the TA is estimated as $597,000 equivalent, comprising $466,000\nequivalent in foreign exchange and $131,000 equivalent in local currency. The entire foreign\nexchange cost and $86,000 equivalent of the local currency cost, for a total of $552,000\nequivalent will be financed by the Bank. The TA will be provided as a grant. The remaining local\ncurrency cost will be financed in kind by the Government, through the provision of counterpart\nstaff, office space, facilities and support services. The detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 1.\nThe investment potential of the ensuing Project is expected to be about $10 million, subject to\nthe findings of Phase I. The Government has been informed that Bank approval of the TA does\nnot commit the Bank to finance any ensuing Project.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n23. DLSE will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and will coordinate among the\nconsultants and other Government agencies concerned with the Project including PWD, the\nWater Authority, and Treasury. The Government will assign a Project Coordinator from DLSE,", "5\nand will provide support staff to assist the consultants. An advisory committee will be\nestablished, and will meet each month during the implementation period to ensure\ninterdepartmental cooperation and coordination, and to identify and overcome potential\nimplementation problems. The advisory committee will be chaired by the Director of DLSE and\nwill include representatives from PWD, Ministry of Women Affairs, the Water Authority, Ministry\nof Transport, and Treasury.\n24. The TA will be implemented over a period of six months by a team of consultants\nto be selected in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. An\nestimated 21 person-months of consultants services will be required. A firm of international\nconsultants will provide 17 person-months of expertise in urban planning, municipal engineering,\nwater and sanitation engineering, roads and traffic engineering, economic and financial analysis,\ninstitutional development, and social dimensions. The international consulting firm will associate\nwith domestic consultants, who will provide four person-months of services in civil engineering,\nwater supply engineering and cost estimation. The terms of reference of the consultants are in\nAppendix 2. The consultants will purchase computers and a printer for use during the\nimplementation of the TA, by direct purchase to ensure that the equipment is compatible with\nequipment used by Government agencies. The equipment will be handed over to DLSE at the\nconclusion of the TA.\n25. The consultants will submit an inception report at the end of the first month, an\ninterim report after three months and a draft final report at the end of the fifth month. The\npresentation of the interim report, which will coincide with the conclusion of Phase I, will describe\nthe findings of Phase I and will include proposals for institutional improvements in urban\nplanning and development, urban structure plans, and a prioritized program of urban\ndevelopment. The draft final report will present full details of all findings and recommendations,\nincluding the feasibility studies. Tripartite meetings will be held among the Government, the\nBank and the consultants to discuss the interim and draft final reports. A final report will be\nsubmitted one month after comments on the draft final report have been made by the\nGovernment and the Bank. The TA is expected to be completed in December 1996.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n26. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the\nIndependent State of Western Samoa, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $552,000\nfor the purpose of the Integrated Urban Development Project, and hereby reports his action to\nthe Board.", "\t\n6 Appendix 1\nESTIMATED COST OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n($)\nForeign\t Local\nCurrency\t Currency\n\t\nCost\t Cost Total\nA.
