INTRODUCTION \n1.  Development  gains  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  are  increasingly  under  threat  from  the \nimpacts of disasters due to natural hazards and climate change. With the economic costs of \ndisasters averaging $53.8 billion a year in Asia and the Pacific between 2005 and 2010,1 the \ncombined development assistance contributions of all the region\u2019s development partners does \nnot keep pace with the economic and social costs of disasters in Asia and the Pacific. This \nassistance amounted to $32 billion for the developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian \nDevelopment bank (ADB) in 2009.2 Ultimately, this means that progress toward the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and other development targets is being undermined by disaster \ndamage and losses that adversely affect development investments. \n \n2.  To reverse this trend, greater attention is needed to address disaster risk management \n(DRM) in the context of development planning and practice. Since development projects by \nnecessity have a local presence and footprint, a key entry point for this integration is the land \nuse management process, which is one of the principle components of local development \nplanning. While there are gaps and deficiencies in the practice of land use planning in many \nparts of Asia and the Pacific, a focus on improving practice and making land use management \nmore risk sensitive will enable stronger outcomes for protecting development investments. \n \n3.  Through this technical assistance (TA) project, ADB will support a series of focused \nresearch and development activities to review the obstacles that have arisen in the past in \neffectively addressing DRM in the context of land use planning and enforcement, the solutions \nthat are being developed to overcome these obstacles, and the best ways to share these good \npractices with a wide set of development practitioners within DMCs.3 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n4.  ADB was the first multilateral development bank to have a dedicated disaster policy4; \nADB\u2019s long commitment to DRM is reinforced in Strategy 2020, with DRM, climate change \nadaptation (CCA), and risk financing identified as core areas of operations.5 ADB promotes an \nintegrated disaster risk management effort based on (i) disaster risk reduction (DRR), (ii) CCA, \nand (iii) disaster risk financing (DRF). Between 1987 and May 2011, ADB contributed $12.55 \nbillion to DRM activities through 522 projects. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  High levels of urbanization and poverty and low levels of effective risk governance are \ncompounding  disaster  exposure  and  vulnerability  for  populations  throughout  Asia  and  the \nPacific. Population settlements have often been located in areas of high disaster risk because of \ntheir geographic amenities\u2014such as easy communication and transport along rivers and coasts \nand locations along coastal mountains that are picturesque and offer better defense; these \namenities also, however, bring significant exposure to disaster hazards. These same rivers and \ncoasts are often at high risk for flooding, and coastal mountains or bays are often situated along \nridgelines or trench lines linked to earthquakes faults.  \n                                                 \n1  Based on ADB analysis of data from the EM-DAT database maintained by the Centre for Research on the \nEpidemiology of Disasters (CRED), Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Belgium. \n2  According to OECD figures sourced from the OECD website on 29 August 2011. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 October 2011. \n4  ADB has had two prior disaster policies: ADB. 1987. Rehabilitation Assistance to Small DMCs Affected by Natural \nDisaster. Manila (R74-87); and ADB. 1989. Rehabilitation Assistance After Disasters. Manila (R191-88). The \ncurrent policy is ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila (R71-04). \n5  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "2  \n \n6.  This vulnerability is exacerbated by faulty systems of land management in which lands, \nwhich should have been left as floodplains, fault easements, or forests, are deemed habitable or \nused for informal settlement due to a lack of effective land access policies. As more people \nmigrate into existing settlements that typically have weak regulatory and planning regimes, the \ncarrying capacities of both natural resource and infrastructure systems are increasingly strained, \nand the poorest and most vulnerable often find themselves living on risk-prone marginal land. \nWeak compliance with and enforcement of building regulations increase the vulnerability of \nurban housing and infrastructure to hazard events. In these situations, individual and household \nincentives for investing in risk reduction are diminished, leading to accumulations of disaster \nvulnerability, damage, and loss, which lead to further poverty in a negative spiral. Climate \nchange is predicted to increase these negative impacts through both the increased frequency \nand severity of certain types of disaster events and the impacts on livelihoods that may reduce \ncoping capacities. \n \n7.  The trend of urban risk accumulation can be reversed if risk-sensitive policies and \npractices are incorporated into urban development. Land use planning and zoning are standard \ntools for managing urban development, are used to varying extents throughout most countries in \nAsia  and  the  Pacific,  and  can  be  readily  modified  to  include  risk  management  elements. \nHowever, in most instances, existing land use plans are not properly implemented or enforced \nwith regard to protecting against disaster risk and do not incorporate mechanisms for DRR or \nCCA. In essence, the land use planning process and its regulatory environment are risk-blind.  \n \n8.  The knowledge exists to achieve risk-resilient development, and there is an increasing \nawareness  among  development  professionals  of  the  negative  consequences  of  disaster \nhazards, including those related to climate change. However, this knowledge has not found its \nway into day-to-day practice. The main reason is that disaster risk management and adaptation \nare still often managed separately from urban development planning. To bridge this gap, better \ntools and shared learning are needed that highlight how to take advantage of opportunities for \nintegrating risk reduction into urban development processes and systems and for using an all-\nhazards approach that captures the synergies between CCA and DRR so that investments in \nthese areas offer two-pronged protection. These tools and learning also need to be carefully \nmatched to the specific needs and context of the planners and development professionals, and \nincorporated into disaster risk management practices. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the TA will be strengthened access to tools and guidance on risk-sensitive \nland use planning and development leading to reduced urban disaster risk in DMCs. The \noutcome will be enhanced knowledge of risk-sensitive land use planning and development \namong participating DMCs. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The proposed TA will support an interactive process with a selected set of cities to \nreview innovative urban risk reduction practice in those cities and elsewhere, and to develop \nguidance materials to more effectively address risk reduction and adaptation in the design, \nimplementation, and management of urban development projects. The target audience for these \nguidance materials will be city planners and managers within DMC cities throughout Asia and \n ", "  3\nthe Pacific and sector specialists from ADB and other development partners working on urban \ndevelopment projects.  \n \n11.  To maximize the range of experience contributing to the TA, participating cities will be \nselected in consultation with regional department and resident mission staff and development \npartners, using criteria to ensure diversity in terms of regional representation, city size and type, \nrisk profile, and level of capacity. Five to six cities will be involved in the workshop activities \nunder the TA. These cities and DMCs have not been selected yet, but will be chosen on the \nbasis of  \n \n(i)  risk exposure and vulnerability, \n(ii)  regional/geographic diversity, \n(iii)  progress in initiating or achieving risk-sensitive land use plans and development \nprojects, \n(iv)  alignment with country partnership strategies or country operation business plans, \n(v)  receptiveness to proposed TA outputs, \n(vi)  presence or absence of international donor community resources, and \n(vii)  potential to benefit cities through application of TA results to existing or future \nADB investment projects (based on a review of ADB project pipelines for DMCs \nin which short-listed cities are located). \n \n12.  Three of the participating cities will also be selected for further development of case \nstudies under the TA based on their experience in designing and implementing incentives for \nrisk-sensitive land use management. \n \n13.  The TA will have three primary outputs: (i) development of guide and sector notes for \nintegrating  risk-sensitive  land  use  management  into  sector  development  projects,  including \nurban development, transport, and water; (ii) case studies of incentives for DRR and CCA and \nhow these have been used to align decision-making among various sets of urban stakeholders; \nand (iii) development of a set of urban risk indicators to track progress in implementing urban \nrisk reduction measures. \n \n14.  Guide and sector notes for integrating risk-sensitive land use management into \ndevelopment  projects.  This  guide  will  help  national  and  local  governments  ensure  that \ninfrastructure and settlements are sited and constructed with appropriate sensitivity to existing \nrisks from all relevant natural hazards, as well as new and uncertain risks due to climate change. \nA set of sector notes on urban DRM will also be developed. Both the guide and the sector notes \nwill cover good practices in the design, advocacy (awareness raising), implementation, and \nenforcement of effective risk-sensitive land use management measures, focusing, in particular, \non the application of these tools in real contexts. Planned topics for the sector notes include \nrisk-sensitive urban redevelopment (including public infrastructure as well as private businesses \nand housing); transport planning; and water, wastewater, and drainage planning, and will build \non work ADB has recently collaborated on (such as the study of Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City and \nManila6). As the Environmental and Safeguards Division of ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) is currently in the process of developing a set of sector \nadaptation notes, these sector notes on urban DRM will be integrated into those adaptation \nnTohtee svi etow st heex perexstesendt  pheorsesinib alere.

Case studies of incentives for implementing DRR and adaptation measures. These \ncase studies will focus on identifying how incentives (such as title amnesties, zoning easements, \nproperty or transfer tax breaks, insurance discounts, and credit provision) have been used to \nraise awareness and align decision-making with respect to DRR and CCA among various sets \nof urban stakeholders, including national and local governments, the private sector, civil society, \nand the residents of both formal and informal settlements. The case studies will also seek to \nidentify gaps in the current application of incentives and to identify innovative solutions for \naddressing those gaps. \n \n16.  Set of urban resilience indicators. Several efforts have been made between 2001 and \n2009 to develop a set of urban resilience indicators, including initiatives by the Universidad \nNacional de Columbia in Manizales, Columbia, the Inter-American Development Bank and the \nEarthquakes and Megacities Initiative. These have tended to be complex efforts to cover a wide \nrange  of  factors  and  have  relied  on  black-box  formulas  and  weightings.  In  practice,  such \nindicators have not been widely adopted because of their inherent complexity and the difficulties \nin adapting the indicators more generally due to their proprietary or black-box nature. This \ncomponent of the TA will focus on building a simple set of open indicators that could be applied \nand improved as part of (i) the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) local government reporting \nprocess that the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN ISDR) is currently testing \nand rolling out, and (ii) the Global City Indicators Facility. By embedding these indicators within \nthese  other  ongoing  initiatives,  their  generation  and  use  can  be  streamlined  to  increase \nadoption in cities throughout Asia and the Pacific. \n \n17.  The dissemination strategy for the outputs will include (i) local dissemination among \ndecision-makers and practitioners within the participating cities, (ii) national dissemination in \nthose  DMCs  through  professional  associations  and  networks,  and  (iii)  regional  and  global \ndissemination through ADB knowledge-sharing mechanisms and through initiatives such as the \nUN ISDR Making Cities Resilient campaign.8 Dissemination options include a web-based toolkit, \ninternal  ADB  announcements,  workshops,  presentations  at  external  conferences,  and \ncollaboration with relevant development networks and professional associations to promote the \ntools and related training materials to be developed under the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The research and development TA is estimated to cost $700,000. ADB will provide \n$371,000 from TASF\u2014IV and $329,000 from TASF\u2014other sources on a grant basis from its \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The  proposed  TA  will  be  implemented  over  26  months.  ADB,  through  the  Public \nManagement, Governance, and Participation Division within the RSDD, will be the executing \nagency. The Public Management, Governance, and Participation Division will manage the TA in \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

Manila (TA 6511-REG). \n8  UN ISDR is currently sponsoring the global Making Cities Resilient campaign, which has already signed on almost \n800 cities and will run through 2015. \n ", "  5\nclose coordination with ADB\u2019s regional departments covering the DMCs from which participating \ncities will be selected and the RSDD\u2019s Environment and Safeguards Division and Sustainable \nInfrastructure Division. Once participating cities are selected, letters of no objection will be \nsecured from the relevant governments in those DMCs. \n \n20.  The TA will utilize 22.5 person-months of consultancy inputs to be provided by six \ninternational  consultants  (16.5  person-months)  and  three  national  consultants  (6  person-\nmonths). The consultants will be engaged through a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Given the project\u2019s importance, \ncomplexity, and impact the quality- and cost-based selection method, based on a quality-to-cost \nratio of 80:20, and simplified technical proposals will be used. Disbursements under the TA will \nbe made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (May 2010, \nas amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. \nActivities  funded  by  this  TA  are  subject  to  formal  review  and  approval  of  the  relevant \ngovernments  and  ADB.  The  TA  is  expected  to  be  implemented  from  November  2011  to \nDecember 2013.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.
