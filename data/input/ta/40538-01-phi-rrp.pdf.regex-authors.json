The DPSP 2 is \nto be provided as a single tranche, based on completed prior actions \ndemonstrating satisfactory progress.  \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nSector: Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector: Economic management \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, governance, private sector \ndevelopment \nSubthemes: Promoting macroeconomic stability, public governance, \nprivate sector investment \n   \nEnvironment  Category C       \nAssessment \n   \nThe Program  The  broad  goals  of  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  Philippine \nRationale  development  plan  (MTPDP)  are  stimulating  higher  and  more \nsustainable economic growth (up to 7% per annum by 2009), creating \njobs (1 million jobs created by 2009), and reducing poverty. Poverty \nrates have declined in the past two decades, but increased to 33% of \nthe population in 2006 from 30% in 2003. The critical fiscal situation \nthat emerged in 2002 compressed public investment and funding for the \nsocial sectors and hurt the poor. These problems were compounded by \npoor governance in public expenditure management (PEM), corruption \nin procurement, and a weak investment climate. Increases in energy \nprices in 2006 contributed to the spike in poverty incidence in 2006. \n \nReforms supporting fiscal consolidation; strengthening governance in \nPEM; reducing corruption in key government agencies; and improving \nthe  investment  climate,  rural  development,  and  infrastructure  are \ncrucially important to putting economic growth on a more sustainable \npath, redirecting spending to the social sectors, and contributing to \npoverty  reduction.  The  2007  ADB  study,  Philippines:  Critical \nDevelopment Constraints, reiterated these areas as core to growth in \nthe Philippines and was used in formulating the subprogram 2. \n \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  Government  implemented  a  series  of \nmeasures  to  address  the  fiscal  imbalance,  resulting  in  a  swift  and \nimpressive  turnaround  in  the  fiscal  situation  and  improved \nmacroeconomic  stability  in  2006.  These  measures  provided  much \nneeded fiscal space for increasing spending on the social sectors and \ninfrastructure in 2007. With increased spending for priority sectors, set \nwithin  a  medium-term  balanced  budget  framework,  the  Philippines \nenjoyed its best macroeconomic performance in more than 30 years: in \n ", " ii \n \n2007 economic growth was 7.2%, investment growth 11.5%, inflation \naveraged 2.6%, and the national government deficit at 0.2% of the \ngross domestic product (GDP). However, the sharp slowdown in the \nUnited  States  economy,  volatility  in  its  financial  markets,  and  the \nunexpected surge in global food and oil prices at the start of 2008 are \nbeginning to affect growth conditions in the Philippines economy, hurt \nthe  poor,  and  create  new  challenges  to  medium-term  fiscal \nsustainability. At the same time, the surge in food prices has refocused \nGovernment attention on improving the rural investment climate. \n \nThe  subprogram  2  for  2008  builds  on  reforms  initiated  under \nsubprogram 1 for fiscal consolidation and strengthening of governance \nin PEM and procurement. Responding to recent developments in the \nglobal economy, subprogram 2 broadens the reform program in the four \ncore areas to (i) improve fiscal sustainability, maintain macroeconomic \nstability,  and  improve  creditworthiness;  (ii)  enhance  governance  in \nPEM;(iii)  improve  the  investment  climate,  rural  development,  and \ninfrastructure; and (iv) reduce poverty and increase social inclusion. It \nsets the groundwork for a more substantial agenda for the investment \nclimate, rural development, and poverty reduction under subprogram 3. \n \nThe  DPSP  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  parallel  development  policy  loan \nrepresent a joint effort of ADB and the World Bank to support and \ndeepen a common reform agenda with the Government. The DPSP \nreflects the Government\u2019s commitment to its reforms over the medium-\nterm, and ADB\u2019s commitment over the medium-term to provide financial \nsupport to program implementation. The DPSP benefits from input from \nthe  governments  of  Australia  (Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment), Japan (Japan Bank for International Cooperation), and \nthe  United  States  (United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment); and the World Bank through preparation of its second \ndevelopment policy loan, which is expected later in 2008. \n   \nImpact and  The subprogram 2 will support the Government\u2019s efforts to (i) achieve \nOutcome  and sustain higher economic growth, and (ii) reduce unemployment \nthrough improved investor confidence. To achieve these objectives, it \nwill undertake strategic reforms to \n \n(i)  improve  fiscal  sustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability, \nand improve creditworthiness by enhancing the quality of fiscal \nmanagement by (a) raising tax revenues annually for the next 2 \nyears (2008\u20132009) through tax policy reforms; (b) strengthening \ntax  administration  and  enforcement,  and  reducing  revenue \nleakages  through  improved  governance;(c)  reducing  inefficient \nspending  to  allow  for  increased  social  and  poverty-related \nspending; and (d) strengthening the debt management strategy to \nprudently manage government-contingent liabilities and risks; \n(ii)  enhance governance in PEM by (a) improving PEM from budget \npreparation to budget execution, and accounting, recording, and \nreporting;  (b)  strengthening  performance  management  and \nimproving public service delivery; (c) reforming procurement; and \n ", "  iii \n(d)  implementing  anticorruption  and  enforcement  strategies  in \nrevenue-collecting agencies and key procurement agencies; \n(iii)  improve the investment climate and promote rural development by \n(a) clarifying and strengthening the legal and regulatory framework \nfor  investment  and  trade,  and  (b)  facilitating  infrastructure \ndevelopment  through  greater  public\u2013private  participation  and \ngreater coordination of public infrastructure investments; and \n(iv)  reduce  poverty  and  increase  social  inclusion  by  improving  the \npolicy framework for social protection, sustaining real spending on \nhealth and education, improving targeting of programs, improving \nservice  delivery,  and  introducing  a  conditional  cash  transfer \nprogram tied to family performance outcomes in child education \nand health. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $250,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility  for  the  Development  Policy  Support  Program, \nsubprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft program loan agreement.  \n   \nPeriod and  The subprogram 2 period will be from April 2007 to October 2008, with \nTranching  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $250  million  to  be  disbursed  when  the \nGovernment has met the conditions for loan effectiveness. Subprogram \n3 of the DPSP will be submitted for Board consideration approximately \n12 months after the effectiveness of the subprogram 2, subject to the \nGovernment\u2019s readiness to continue with its reform agenda.  \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures and \nassociated  costs  of  reform,  and  to  help  maintain  current  social \nexpenditure and infrastructure spending. \n   \nExecuting Agency   Department of Finance (DOF)  \n   \nImplementation  The  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM)  will  be  the \nArrangements  Implementing Agency responsible for implementing the subprogram 2. \nIt will be supported by relevant government line agencies, including the \nOffice  of  the  Ombudsman,  Department  of  Education  (DepEd), \nDepartment  of  Agriculture  (DOA),  Department  of  Health  (DOH), \nDepartment of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), Department of \nTrade and Industry (DTI) and the National Economic and Development \nAuthority (NEDA). The DPSP coordinating committee chaired by the \nDOF  undersecretary  and  comprising  officials  from  DOF,  DBM,  and \nNEDA, will be responsible for coordinating program implementation and \nsustaining subprogram 2 actions with DBM and relevant government \nline agencies involved in supporting the DPSP. The committee will meet \nquarterly to monitor progress, oversee program implementation, and \nprovide guidance and direction to DOF and DBM.    \n \n ", " iv \n \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nDisbursement  costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n   \nProgram Benefits  The DPSP will provide significant benefits and have a positive impact \nand Beneficiaries  on the poor because of the following:  \n(i)   fiscal consolidation achieved and progress toward medium-term \nfiscal  sustainability  will  promote  macroeconomic  stability,  and \nfoster broad-based economic growth, job creation, and poverty \nreduction\u2014cornerstones  of  the  Government\u2019s  MTPDP  and  the \nPhilippine development forum; \n(ii)  an increase in tax revenues as a percentage of GDP will provide \nadditional resources for spending on social sectors and therefore \nhave a direct positive impact on the poor; \n(iii)  better governance and efficiency in PEM will include enhanced \ncredibility  in  the  budget,  implementation  of  the  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  and  procurement  reforms,  budget \nexecution, and more systematic recording and reporting of budget \naccounts; \n(iv)  lower transaction costs for business by reducing bureaucracy and \nimproving trade facilitation will open new opportunities, increase \ninvestment  and  productivity,  boost  the  economy,  increase \nincomes, and create jobs; \n(v)  higher  infrastructure  spending  will  generate  long-term  growth, \nstimulate investment, create jobs, and raise incomes; \n(vi)  improved  social  sector  outcomes  as  a  result  of  increasing \nspending,  and  implementing  better-targeted  social  assistance \nprogram,  a  conditional  cash  transfer  program  linked  to  family \nperformance outcomes in child education and health; and \n(vii)  sustainable governance programs by institutionalizing governance \nprograms  such  as  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework, \nintegrity development reviews, and DOF\u2019s anticorruption revenue \ninitiatives  in  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  and  Bureau  of \nCustoms, will help support the sustainability of these initiatives. \n   \nRisks and  The  DPSP  is  firmly  embedded  in  the  MTPDP,  the  Philippines \nAssumptions  development forum, and the Government\u2019s ongoing sector strategies \ncovering  fiscal  consolidation,  tax  administration  reform,  PEM, \nprocurement  reform,  investment  competitiveness,  rural  development, \nand social protection. The assumptions underlying the DPSP include \nthe following:  \n  \n(i)  The economy will be able to withstand global oil and food price \nshocks. \n(ii)  The  Government  will  stay  on  course  with  key  policy  reform \nmeasures, and continue to liaise effectively with Congress.  \n \n ", "  v \nHowever, the DPSP has risks: \n  \n(i)  A sharp slowdown in the United States economy and turbulence in \nits  capital  markets  affect  growth  conditions  in  the  Philippines \neconomy.  The  surge  in  food  price  inflation  persists  in  2008, \nslowing  household  consumption  and  economic  growth,  and \nthreatening to increase poverty. This may stress the fiscal policy if \nthe  economy  slows  down  faster  than  expected.  ADB  staff \nestimates suggest that food price increases of 30% could increase \npoor families\u2019 spending on rice by up to P50 billion, including the \n7% of the population that are vulnerable to falling into poverty. \nHowever,  these  effects  may  be  mitigated  by  the  continued \nresilience of remittances, which are up by 14.5% in dollar terms \n(20% in peso terms) in the first 4 months of 2008 over the same \nperiod in 2007, and continued robust tax revenue collections in the \nfirst semester of 2008 providing some space for additional budget \nspending. \n(ii)  However, with the economic stresses in 2008 and with an election \nin 2010, the Government may be tempted to introduce populist \npolicies that could threaten fiscal discipline in 2008 and 2009. \n(iii)  The  2010  presidential  elections  may  slow  implementation  of \nreforms.  However,  the  Government  has  full  ownership  of  the \nDPSP  reform  program,  which  is  embedded  in  the  Philippines \ndevelopment forum and its sector strategies; moreover the first \nDPSP generation is expected to be completed before the next \nelections. \n(iv)  The  capacity  of  agencies  to  implement  reforms  may  be \nconstrained by resources and other emerging priorities in 2008. \nHowever, many development partners are supporting the reforms \nthrough technical assistance. \n   \nTechnical  Policy and advisory technical assistance (PATA) is included with the \nAssistance  subprogram 2. The PATA is estimated to cost $1.15 million equivalent. \nADB will provide $800,000 on a grant basis from the ADB technical \nassistance  funding  program.  The  Government  will  provide  the \nremaining $350,000 equivalent by providing counterpart staff and other \nfacilities. \n \nThe PATA will support DBM in implementing and monitoring key PEM \nreforms, with the focus on enhancing budget execution, accounting, \nrecording,  and  reporting.  The  PATA  has  three  components.  Under \ncomponent 1, it will support DBM with its budget execution reforms. \nActivities  include  assistance  with  streamlining  budget  execution \nprocedures  and  information  systems,  conducting  diagnostic \nassessments  of  spending  behavior  of  line  ministries,  strengthening \npayroll and allowance internal control and monitoring procedures, and \nimplementing the rollout of DBM\u2019s internal control and audit in selected \npilot  ministries.  The  second  component  will  build  on  the  results  of \ndiagnostic work on the government financial management information \nsystem  (GFMIS),  which  the  DBM  will  undertake  in  2008  including \nimplementing the road map for developing an integrated GFMIS within \n ", " vi \n \nthe national Government. This component will support DBM in initiating \ndevelopment of the GFMIS, building on existing information systems \nsuch  as  the  electronic  national  government  accounting  system \n(eNGAS),  e-budget,  and  Philippine  government  electronic  portal \n(PhilGEPS). This component will help DBM establish an interagency \nworking group to oversee GFMIS reforms across government. The third \ncomponent will help DBM develop and implement change management \nstrategies to support the DBM budget reform program and its reform \nunit,  and  prepare  a  strategy  for  rollout  to  selected  line  ministries. \nAssistance will be provided to selected line ministries to strengthen \ncapacity to provide timely posting of budget data on the DBM website.  \n \nA  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  will  implement  the \nPATA activities. ADB will engage a consulting firm or individuals in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). A total of 50 (19 international and 31 \nnational) person-months will be required.  \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Philippines for the Development Policy Support Program, Subprogram 2 \n(DPSP 2). 1 This report also describes proposed policy and advisory technical assistance (PATA) \nfor improving public expenditure management (PEM), and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the PATA. The \nprogram design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  Development Strategies and the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan \n2.  In 2004, the Government announced the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan \n2004\u20132010 (MTPDP),2 setting out the country\u2019s development priorities, policy agenda, programs, \nand projects for the next 6 years. The key objectives of the MTPDP are to achieve higher and \nmore sustainable economic growth, create jobs, reduce poverty, and make progress toward the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  It  identifies  the  fiscal  imbalance;  inadequate \ninfrastructure;  rapid  urbanization  and  congestion,  especially  in  Metro  Manila;  increasing \nunemployment; and inefficient delivery of basic services as major challenges. \n \n3.  In 2005, the Government and the international development partners decided to convert \nthe annual Consultative Group meetings into the Philippines development forum (PDF). The \nPDF provides an opportunity for ongoing dialogue, involving other stakeholders, such as civil \nsociety, the private sector, and the academic community. The Government convenes the PDF \nto  discuss  the  reform  agenda  and  ways  the  development  partners  can  assist  with \nimplementation.3 The PDF allows the development partners to enhance their policy engagement \nwith the Government and to provide an impetus to MTPDP implementation. Currently the PDF \nhas seven working groups, each focusing on priority areas of the Government\u2019s development \nagenda (Figure 1). In March 2006, the Government agreed with the World Bank to use the PDF \nagenda as the basis for a World Bank development policy loan. Shortly after the workshop, the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) was invited to join the process and to prepare the reform \nagenda through the DPSP. The agenda was refined and modified through subsequent PDF \nworkshops in 2007 and 2008 to reflect the Government\u2019s new priorities and medium-term \nchallenges. When the DPSP was first formulated in 2006, it was anchored in four core areas of \nthe PDF: fiscal consolidation, governance, investment climate and infrastructure, and social \nprogress. At the request of the Government, subprograms 2 and 3 of the DPSP will continue \nwith these four areas and add rural development as part of the investment climate component \nreflecting the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s increased focus on improving the investment climate.  \n \n4.  To  help  implement  the  MTPDP  priorities,  the  Government  adopted  several  sector \nstrategies,  most  with  a  time-bound  implementation  plan  and  clearly  defined  ministerial \nresponsibilities; some are supported by ADB sector programs and TA (Figure 2). The fiscal \nconsolidation  strategy,  which  began  earlier  in  2004,  outlined  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nstabilization and consolidation strategy up to 2010. It has been successful in reducing the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

The key strategic goals are to achieve a balanced public budget by 2010; and increase \nprimary expenditures from 12.6% of GDP in 2007 to 13.6% by 2010, and tax revenues from \n14% in 2007 to 15% by 2010. The tax administration reform program was launched in 2006 with \nthe establishment of a senior tax administration reform group to oversee the program at the \nBureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). In 2007, the group produced an action plan for 2007\u20132010 \nand  began  implementation  of  the  first  phase  in  mid-2007,  beginning  with  cleaning  and \nexpanding the taxpayer database and piloting computerization of two revenue district offices \n(RDOs). In addition, BIR and the development partners established a government and aid \ncoordination group for tax reform to support the reform program. ADB has actively participated \nin  this  group  and  in  2008  is  implementing  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  selected \ncomponents  of  BIR's  reform  agenda.4 The  Government\u2019s  budget  and  procurement  reform \nagenda, under the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), is focused on implementing \nthe medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), the organizational performance indicators \nframework (OPIF) to enhance management performance, and governance initiatives to improve \nbudget transparency. The Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) under DBM has set \nout a 3-year action plan for 2007\u20132010 to implement the 2003 procurement law. ADB is actively \nworking  with  GPPB  to  harmonize  Government  and  ADB  procurement  procedures,  and  to \nstrengthen operations of the Philippines government electronic portal (PhilGEPS), which is \nmandated under the procurement law as the portal for posting procurement agencies\u2019 bid \nnotices and awards. With fiscal consolidation on track, the Government is now shifting its reform \nattention to microeconomic reforms. The National Competitiveness Council, formed in October \n2006, is mandated to help the Government develop a strategy to improve competitiveness. ADB \nhas been actively engaged with the council to develop ways to institutionalize a regulatory \nreview  process  within  government.  The  council  drafted  and  advocated  a  framework  for \ninstitutionalizing a regulatory impact assessment within government; adoption of an action plan \nis included in subprogram 3 of the DPSP (para. 56 and 64). In 2007, the Government, with ADB \nassistance, developed and issued a new social protection definition that sets out the core \ncomponents as labor market programs, social insurance, social welfare, and better targeted \nsocial safety net programs. \n \nB.  The Government and Its Development Partners \n5.  The DPSP, structured as a program cluster, aims to help the Government achieve its \nmedium-term  goals  of  sustained  high  economic  growth  of  6%\u20137%  per  annum,  lower \nunemployment, and reduce poverty, as highlighted in the development policy letter addressed to \nthe ADB President (Appendix 2). For effective development results, the DPSP focuses on a \nbroad policy agenda that addresses thematic and cross-cutting issues in five core areas: fiscal \nsustainability, governance in PEM and anticorruption in the key revenue-raising agencies, the \ninvestment climate, rural development, and poverty reduction and social inclusion. These are all \nkey outcomes and outputs of the ADB country strategy and program.5 The DPSP emphasizes \nthe  achievement  of  measurable  policy  outcomes  and  results,  while  leaving  detailed  policy \nprescriptions to programs and projects in individual sectors. In this way, the DPSP complements \nand  reinforces  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan  programs  and  projects  aligned  with  the  Government\u2019s \nstrategies (para. 6). For example, the DPSP sets out broad policy outcomes for improving PEM, \n \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2007.

The DPSP also sets out a broad policy outcome for rural development including a trigger \non development of a strategy but leaves the details to the development of the strategy and \nsubsequent  projects  to  ADB\u2019s  sector  programs,  such  as  the  proposed  integrated  natural \nresources  and  environmental  management  program,  currently  under  preparation,8 which \nincludes development of an uplands strategy for watersheds. ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Agriculture, \nEnvironment, and Natural Resources Division leads the dialogue with the Government including \nthrough  the  PDF  working  group  on  rural  development.  The  close  alignment  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda and the DPSP strengthens the Government\u2019s commitment to the \nreforms under the DPSP. The DPSP process is guiding ADB\u2019s activities in the Philippines in \n2008 and 2009. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program 2005\u20132007 for the Philippines identified three key \npriorities for ADB assistance that ensured a strategically focused program. Program selectivity \nwas guided by country-specific constraints\u2014macroeconomic instability (fiscal consolidation and \nPEM), investment climate, and social sector. In this way, ADB operations were designed to \naddress these constraints under three corresponding pillars in a comprehensive and integrated \napproach to development. The DPSP operationalizes the strategy by providing an umbrella \noperation that complements and reinforces ADB\u2019s sector program loans and projects (Figure 2). \nUnder the first pillar of macroeconomic stability, the local government financing and budget \nreform program rolls out budget reforms and financing for local government units (LGUs). A \nseries of TA projects on tax administration and public financial management (TA on chart of \naccounts harmonization) are provided for capacity development in these areas. Under the \nsecond pillar of the investment climate, ADB\u2019s strategic focus has been on the energy sector \nand capital market development. The Power Sector Development Program loan9 has deepened \nthe market for energy with the establishment of the wholesale energy market and is expected to \nresult in privatization of almost 70% of the National Power Corporation\u2019s energy assets by the \nend  of  2008.  The  Financial  Market  Regulation  and  Intermediation  Program  loan  promotes \nimproved intermediation and efficiency.10 The Infrastructure for Rural Productivity Enhancement \nSector Project11 supports infrastructure development in the southern Philippines and is expected \nto construct from 800 to 1,000 km of rural feeder roads, 5,000 hectares of common irrigation, \nand about 100 portable water systems. It is the first ADB project to work directly with 95 \nmunicipalities  and  involves  substantial  capacity  building  of  LGUs.  In  addition,  ADB  has \ncontinuing operations in the urban, rural, and water sectors such as coastal fisheries and \nresource management, agrarian reform, and infrastructure; these have had a positive affect on \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007.

The implementation of the \nHealth Sector Development Program facilitated the Government\u2019s application of a programmatic \napproach using multiple development partners.13 The secondary education project14 provided \nsupport for components of the Government\u2019s ongoing education reform and decentralization \nprocess (footnote 12). \n \n7.  The  Medium-Term  Programmatic  Approach.  Key  features  of  the  DPSP  include  \n(i) three single tranche operations, with a well-defined, medium-term framework specified at the \noutset and including completed high-impact reforms prior to consideration by the ADB Board of \nDirectors; (ii) triggers for subsequent subprograms to ensure a continuous dialogue between the \nGovernment, development partners, and stakeholders; and (iii) a small number of well-targeted \npolicy actions designed to achieve high-impact outcomes in priority sectors. In this way, the \nDPSP  provides  a  coherent  medium-term  reform  strategy  with  three  discrete  but  linked \nsubprograms and a strong emphasis on performance, as the decision on whether to proceed \nwith the next subprogram is contingent on overall satisfactory performance of the triggers. It \nrecognizes the necessity for flexibility in the reform measures, with provisions for incorporating \nlessons and responding to changes in the external environment in the design of downstream \nsubprograms.15  \n \n8.  The DPSP has the following three phases: \n \n(i)  Subprogram  1.  Financed  by  ADB  ($250  million)  in  2007,  it  supported  the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  program  creating  the  basis  for  continuous \npolicy dialogue and engagement during 2007\u20132009. \n(ii)  Subprogram  2.  The  present  phase,  to  be  financed  by  ADB  ($250  million), \nincreases the focus on strengthening governance in PEM and procurement. It \nbuilds on reforms initiated under subprogram 1 for fiscal consolidation, increases \nthe focus on strengthening governance in PEM and procurement, addresses new \nrisks  to  the  program,  and  incorporates  lessons  from  the  assessment  of \nimplementation of policy reforms in 2007 and 2008. \n(iii)  Subprogram 3. Expected to be processed in 2009 with ADB financing, it will \nincrease the focus on institutionalizing governance programs, the investment \nclimate,  and  the  social  sector.  With  fiscal  consolidation  achieved  under \nsubprogram 2, reforms will focus on PEM. Subprogram 3 will increase attention \nto  institutionalizing  priority  programs  of  the  Government  such  as  the \nanticorruption revenue programs in BIR and Bureau of Customs (BOC), and \nregulatory reform. It is expected to be closely aligned to ADB\u2019s new country \nstrategy and program for the Philippines for 2009\u20132011. \n \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2008.

The  DPSP  and  the  World \nBank\u2019s parallel development policy loan comprise a joint effort of ADB and the World Bank to \nsupport and deepen a common reform agenda with the Government. The DPSP reflects the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to its reforms over the medium-term, and ADB\u2019s commitment over \nthe medium-term to provide financial support to program implementation. In formulating the \nDPSP, the Government and ADB have drawn on the Government\u2019s agenda as articulated \nthrough the PDF and its sector strategies. The Government of Japan is currently considering \ncofinancing the Subprograms 2 and 3. The World Bank is preparing its second development \npolicy loan, which is expected later in 2008. ADB and the World Bank have coordinated reviews \nof subprogram 2 policy triggers with the Government. Formulations of subprogram 2 and the \npolicy triggers for subprogram 3 of the DPSP have benefited from input from the governments of \nAustralia  (Australian  Agency  for  International  Development),  Japan  (Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation),  and  United  States  (United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment); as well as the World Bank. The DPSP and its support for coordinated sector-\nspecific interventions are part of efforts to align and harmonize the strategies of development \npartners  with  those  of  the  Government.  Appendix  3  provides  the  development  partner \ncoordination matrix. \n \n10.  The DPSP cluster has a number of important features. First, it is fully based on the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda  and  this  promotes  full  ownership  and  participation.  Second, \ndesigned  as  a  program  cluster  with  subsequent  subprograms  linked  by  triggers  within  a \nmedium-term framework, it encourages continuous engagement by the development partners \nover the medium term. Third, the fiscal and cross-cutting policy framework, including the full \nimplementation of the MTEF and piloted internal control and audit, coordinates well with the \nADB\u2019s sector reform programs such as the proposed governance and justice reform program, \nwhich  are  designed  to  broaden  and  deepen  the  DPSP.  Fourth,  the  DPSP  emphasizes \ninstitutionalizing  procedures,  processes,  and  programs  to  ensure  effective  implementation, \nrather than focusing merely on conditions that often do not yield any clear results on the ground. \nThe Government commits to the DPSP in the development policy letter (Appendix 2). \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR  \nA.  Review of the Economy, Investment Climate, and Millennium Development Goals \n11.  Best Macroeconomic Performance in 30 Years. Data from the National Statistical \nCoordination Board indicates economic growth at 7.2% in 2007, the highest on record for almost \n30 years. It is among the highest growth rates in the Asian region. Growth has been broad-\nbased with services the fastest growing sector with a growth rate of 8.2% in 2007, contributing \nto  56%  of  economic  growth,  followed  by  industry  and  agriculture.  On  the  demand  side, \nconsumption  remains  an  engine  of  growth  rising  by  5.9%  in  2007  contributing  to  65%  of \neconomic growth. \n \n12.  Three Features of the Current Economic Growth Performance. First, the current \neconomic expansion is the longest in three decades, with economic growth averaging 5.1% per \nyear since 2000, compared with average annual growth of 2% in the 1990s (Appendix 4). \nSecond, the current economic expansion reflects improved economic fundamentals associated \nwith historically low inflation in 2007, fiscal consolidation, declining public debt as a share of \nGDP, current account surplus, and higher total factor productivity growth. In contrast, previous \nexpansions were associated with sharp macroeconomic imbalances including high inflation, \nincreasing public debt, and at times deterioration in the balance of payments. These are all \nfeatures  of  a  boom\u2013bust  business  cycle  not  based  on  economic  fundamentals.  Political \n ", "8     \n \ninstability helped shorten economic expansion in the 1980s and 1990s. Third, remittances have \nplayed an important part in current economic growth. Remittances reached an all-time high in \n2007, with $14.4 billion recorded through the banking system, or a growth rate of 13% over \n2006.  Informal  remittances  are  estimated  at  $3  billion.  Remittances  have  kept  the current \naccount in surplus at 5 % of GDP and boosted household consumption as they account for \nmore  than  10%  of  household  incomes.  Remittances  posted  through  the  banking  system \naccelerated to $5.4 billion (or 14.5% year-on-year growth rate) in the first 4 months of 2008, \nallaying  fears  that  the  slowdown  in  the  United  States  (US)  economy  would  decrease \nremittances to the Philippines.  \n \n13.  Recovery of Investment. Investment spending picked up strongly in 2007 for the first \ntime in 10 years, growing by 11.8%, well above its average annual growth rate of 0.8% from \n1997 to 2006 (Table 1). The upturn was driven by the 25% growth in public infrastructure \nspending in 2007. Private sector investment also grew strongly with private construction growing \nby a robust 15.9% compared with negative 1.4% in 2006. Spending on durable equipment grew \nby 4.4%. Foreign direct investment approvals (a measure of intended investment) doubled in \n2007 over 2006. Overall, the investment to GDP ratio (in current prices) improved from 14.0% in \n2006 to 14.8% in 2007. Investment growth slowed to 6.6% (year-on-year) in the first quarter of \n2008, primarily due to a 9.5% contraction in public construction. Private construction remained \nrobust  growing  by  15.1%.  Also  encouraging  for  investment,  purchases  of  new  durable \nequipment grew by 8.2% in the first quarter of 2008, double the growth rate in 2007. \n \n14.  Deterioration of the External Environment. In 2008, the Philippines economy has \nbeen affected by three adverse developments in the external environment: (i) impact of US \nfinancial  sector  turbulence,  (ii)  the  US  and  global  economic  slowdown,  and  (iii)  recent \ncommodity and fuel price increases. The sharp slowdown in the US economy and turbulence in \nits financial markets is affecting growth conditions in the Philippines. While the economic growth \nrates of the Philippines and other developing economies can and do diverge from the US growth \nrate, volatility in the US is transmitted to developing economies. The direct impact of the US \nfinancial crisis is limited, but indirect effects are possible through restructuring of balance sheet \neffects of US banks. Possible effects include credit crunch and in recent months rising spreads \non sovereign and corporate bond issues. The unexpected recent surge in international food and \nenergy prices has resulted in higher domestic inflation in 2008. Inflation hit a 17-year high of \n12.2% in July 2008 on a year-on-year basis, with rice prices up by 43%. ADB staff forecasts for \ninflation suggest a continuation of double-digit food price inflation through to the third quarter of \n2008. The economic growth rate of 4.7% in the first quarter of 2008 and 4.6% in the second \nquarter of 2008 suggests that these adverse effects are beginning to affect the real economy. \nPrivate consumption slowed from 5.8% in 2007 to 3.4% in the second quarter of 2008 and \nexports in value-added terms contracted. These adverse developments have increased the \ndownside  risks  to  the  balance  of  payments  and  public  debt  sustainability.16, 17 While  the \nPhilippine central bank (Bangko Sentral ng Philipinas) has been operating a prudent monetary \n                                                 \n16  For example, a recent International Monetary Fund report simulated the impact of a 20% increase in global \ncommodity prices on the stability of the Philippines\u2019 balance of payments, measured by foreign reserve coverage in \nmonths of imports. It shows that the simulated price increases would lower reserves between 0.5 and 0.8 months \nof imports, not enough to trigger a balance of payments problem. However, a larger price increase would increase \nthe vulnerability of balance of payments. International Monetary Fund. 2008.

Prudent Fiscal Management. The Government deficit fell to P12.4 billion in 2007 (0.2% \nof GDP) from P64.8 billion in 2006 (0.9% of GDP). This fiscal performance compares with a \n2.7% budget deficit in 2005 and 5.2% in 2003. The consolidated public sector budget essentially \nremained in balance for a second consecutive year surpassing the medium-term target of a \nbalanced budget in 2010 (para. 17). The nonfinancial public sector debt to GDP ratio declined to \n67%, back to its level in the early 1990s (Figure 4). Unlike previous budgets, the reduction in the \ndeficit came about through increases in total revenues rather than suppression of expenditures \n(Appendix 5). In March 2006, PDF stakeholders cautioned against disproportionate reliance on \nexpenditure cuts rather than revenue collection. Noninterest expenditures increased by 19% in \nthe 2007 budget over 2006 (2005 budget reenacted),18 aided by a reduction in debt servicing \ncosts of P36 billion from lower interest rates on public debt and the peso exchange rate \nappreciation. Spending on the social sectors (health and education) and public infrastructure \nwere the main beneficiaries of the boost in spending in 2007, with spending on infrastructure \nrising by 45.4% assured by the Government\u2019s commitment to earmark 30% of incremental \nvalue-added tax revenue collections to the social sectors. On the revenue side, tax revenue \ncollection increased by 9% over 2006, but fell short of its budget target of 17.3% (para. 18). To \nmeet  the  shortfall  in  revenues,  the  Government  accelerated  privatization  of  assets  raising  \nP90 billion in proceeds, up from P5 billion in 2006. More than 40% came from privatization of \nstate-owned energy assets. One important consequence of the Government\u2019s commitment to \nfiscal discipline is improved investor confidence in the economy as reflected in the international \ncredit-rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s second improved credit rating for the Philippines in 12 \nmonths from \u201cnegative outlook\u201d in 2006, to \u201cstable outlook\u201d in 2007, to \u201cpositive outlook\u201d in 2008. \nFiscal discipline continued into 2008 with the budget deficit at P33.4 billion for the first 7 months \ncompared with P39 billion for the same period in 2007. \n \n16.  Unemployment,  Poverty,  and  Income  Distribution.  The  sustained  economic \nexpansion is beginning to improve the Philippines' stubbornly high unemployment rate for the \nfirst time in a decade. Lower long-term economic growth coupled with relatively restrictive labor \nregulations meant higher longer-term unemployment in the Philippines compared to its regional \nneighbors. In 2007, the unemployment rate fell to an average of 7.3% from 7.9% in 2006; \nhowever the economic slowdown in 2008 has raised the average unemployment rate. Progress \non poverty reduction and income inequality has been less clear. The 2006 family income and \nexpenditure survey indicates an increase of the poverty rate from 30% in 2003 to 33% in 2006. \nHowever, ADB staff assessments suggest that much of the increase in poverty is attributed to \nenergy  cost  increases  in  2006  rather  than  structural  changes  to  household  incomes  and \ndistribution  as  the  Gini  coefficient  did  not  change  significantly.  Hence,  the  spike  may  be \ntemporary and not a reversal of recent trends. Table 2 shows that both poor and nonpoor \nfamilies spent a larger share of their budgets on fuel, energy, and transportation in 2006 \ncompared to 2003 (Supplementary Appendix B). Recent World Bank projections19 of poverty \nincidence, measured by the $2 a day poverty line, indicate a reduction in poverty from 46.9% in \n2006 to 44.9% in 2007 (Supplementary Appendix B). However, ADB expects a new spike in \npoverty in 2008 due to the surge in food prices. ADB poverty impact simulations show that food \nprice inflation is estimated to raise food expenditures of the poor (those living below the poverty \nline) by as much as P50 billion in 2008, including the 7% of the population that are vulnerable to \n                                                 \n18  Congress failed to pass the proposed 2006 national government budget. Consequently, the Government reenacted \nthe 2005 budget for 2006, as permissible under the Philippines constitution. While, Congress approved a budget \nsupplement in mid-2006, overall the reenacted budget resulted in suppressed public spending in 2006.  \n19  World Bank. 2008.

In 2006 the Government advanced the target to achieve a balanced \nnational budget under the MTPDP by 2 years to 2008, based on the surge in tax revenues in the \n2006 budget (tax revenues grew 1.3 percentage points of GDP in 2006). The 2007 budget \ndeficit was recorded at 0.2% of GDP, making the 2008 target highly probable. However, much \nhas changed since the end of 2007. Global developments have deteriorated and these are \nbeginning to negatively impact the Philippine economy, as is the case for the region. The \nGovernment has decided, and development partners concur, that the balanced budget target \nshould be reverted back to 2010 to provide flexibility in fiscal policy in 2008 in the event \nprograms are necessary to mitigate the impact of recent increases in food prices on the poor \nand to maintain priority spending programs if the economy slows down. The Government is \ntargeting a deficit of no more than 1% of GDP in 2008, 0.5% in 2009, and a balanced budget in \n2010. The 2010 target is achievable, but requires increased efforts to raise tax revenues to \nmeet the Government\u2019s fiscal program target of 15% of GDP by 2010 (para. 18). \n \n18.  Tax Revenue Performance. BIR cash collection in the first half of 2007 was up 5% over \nthe same period in 2006, and up 9% for the entire year, short of the 2007 budget target for BIR \nof a 17.3% increase over 2006. BOC also experienced a shortfall in collection from its budget \ntarget. Government and ADB assessments of revenue performance in 2007 show that the tax \nshortfall occurred in the first semester of 2007 because of a combination of tax administration, \nmacroeconomic, and governance factors. These include (i) the removal of the 70% cap on \nvalue-added tax credits that contributed to an estimated drop in value-added tax collections of \nP19 billion in the first semester, (ii) front loading of excise tax payments in the fourth quarter of \n2006 to avoid the excise tax hike in January 2007, significantly lowering excise tax collection in \nthe first quarter of 2007, (iii) a surge in smuggling of petroleum through the Subic special \neconomic zone, and (iv) faster than expected appreciation of the peso exchange rate for the \nyear, resulting in lower value-added tax and customs duties collected on imported products than \noriginally  budgeted.  The  prevalence  of  tax  exemptions 20 and  generous  taxable  income \ndeductions in the growth sectors of the economy limited growth-induced tax collection. Weak tax \nadministration and inefficiencies in the tax policy indicate that BIR has been unable to lift tax \nrevenues  through  improvements  in  tax  efficiency  and  enforcement.  By  mid-2007,  the \n                                                 \n20  The Department of Finance estimates tax holidays and other fiscal incentives result in foregone tax revenues of \nabout P47 billion per year. \n ", "12    \n \nGovernment undertook short-term remedial actions that partially restored tax revenues to its \nbudget targets with tax revenue collections growing by 13%\u201315% in the second semester of \n2007 over the same period in 2006.21 The recovery in tax revenue collections continued into \n2008 with BIR tax revenue collection rising by about 14% year-on-year for the first 6 months of \n2008, in line with 2008 budget targets and an improvement in the tax to GDP ratio estimated at \nabout 0.26% in 2008 (Figure 4). \n \nFigure 3: Public Sector Deficit and Debt\n(as % GDP)\n6  110 \nNFPS Debt \n5  100 \n4  90 \nDefic3it  %  80  Debt %\n2  70 \n1  NFPS deficit 60 \n0  50 \n1990  1992  1994  1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 \n-1  40 \nGDP = gross domestic product, NFPS = nonfinancial public sector        \nSource: Bureau of Treasury, Department of Finance.

Senior personnel changes at BIR were also \nmade in the first semester of 2007 including the replacement of the BIR commissioner. \n ", "  13\n19.  Sustaining Priority Spending. The Government is targeting an increase in the rate of \nnoninterest  expenditure  to  GDP  from  12.6%  in  2007  to  13.6%  by  2010.  Ensuring  priority \nspending is sustainable within a balanced budget framework over the medium term will require \nfurther  effort  to  raise  tax  revenues.  Reaching  the  Government\u2019s  revised  medium-term  tax \nrevenue target of 15% of GDP by 2010 will require additional reforms to tax policy and tax \nadministration. The Department of Finance (DOF) is targeting an increase in tax administration \nefficiency that would add tax revenue collections of up to 0.3% of GDP per year from 2008 to \n2010. To accomplish this target, BIR has developed a comprehensive tax administration reform \nprogram up to 2010, but implementation has been delayed and is much slower than expected. \nThis is partly due to the complexity of the reform program and the fact that BIR\u2019s budgetary \nresources for long-term reforms are critically constrained as reflected in the continuous decline \nin BIR operating costs per employee since 2000 (Appendix 5). Staff resistance, vested interests, \nand corruption have also contributed to the slow start to reform as it is rolled out to the regional \ntax offices. Staff resistance and corruption are intertwined with BIR\u2019s resource constraints. For \nexample, starting salaries of legal staff at BIR is P12,000 per month compared with P32,000 \n(plus P24,000 allowances) for legal staff at the central bank. Thus, the Government must \naddress longer-term resource constraints at BIR.22 A draft bill has been submitted to Congress \nthat if passed will allow BIR to set salaries closer to market values. In the short term, BIR should \nfocus its efforts on priority areas of tax administration that are likely to achieve the biggest \nefficiency gains in the short to medium term. These include reforming and increasing the rates \nof excise taxes in 2009, and rationalizing investment incentives once Congress passes the \nrevised bill (expected in 2008).23 The anticorruption revenue programs\u2014\u201crun after tax evaders\u201d \n(RATE) in BIR and \u201crun after tax smugglers\u201d (RATS) in BOC\u2014have made some progress in \nidentifying tax evasion cases and increasing tax prosecutions. But BIR and BOC will need to \ninstitutionalize  these  programs  within  their  organizations  to  ensure  they  become  effective \ndeterrents to tax evasion. At the same time, institutional linkages will need to be strengthened \nbetween BIR, Department of Justice, and Court of Tax Appeals; and capacity developed to \nensure effective, coordinated effort in tax prosecution. Strengthening the revenue-forecasting \ncapabilities of DOF (and the Bureau of Treasury) is important to ensure realistic tax revenue \nforecasts. In response to weak tax revenue performance in the first semester of 2007, ADB is \nproviding TA to BIR and DOF to strengthen revenue-enhancing measures, enforcement, and \nprosecution of tax evaders (footnote 4).24 \n \n20.  Debt Management. Fiscal savings of P36 billion from lower debt servicing costs in 2007 \nclearly demonstrate the importance to fiscal policy of effectively managing public debt and debt \nservicing costs. While progress has been made in debt management, particularly lengthening \nthe average maturity of government debt and maintaining a diverse portfolio of obligations, \nmuch needs to be done to improve the institutional framework for debt management. Current \ndebt management systems at DOF are compartmentalized with separate units in the Bureau of \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2008. Philippines Economic Governance Assessment: Lessons from Models of Good Governance in the \nPhilippines. Manila (Governance, Finance, and Trade Division staff report). \n23  ADB staff estimates suggest that about 55% of all investment incentives are redundant; investors would have come \neven without the incentives.

It also assists BIR \n(and the RATE program) and the National Prosecutors Office in developing tax cases, training prosecutors in tax \ncases, developing a database for tracking tax cases, and facilitating institutional linkages between BIR, National \nProsecutors Office, and Department of Justice to accelerate tax prosecution cases. \n ", "14    \n \nTreasury, Corporate Affairs (covering contingent liabilities of government-owned and -controlled \ncorporations and others), and the International Finance Group (covering official development \nassistance and international commercial borrowings). Consequently, debt management is not \nconducted within an integrated debt framework as suggested by best international practice. The \ndebt information management system is outdated and human resource capabilities are limited. \nA medium-term debt management and risk strategy is needed. DOF with ADB assistance has \noutlined options for strengthening debt management including a strategy.25  \n \n2.  Governance in Public Expenditure Management and Anticorruption \n21.  Governance Issues. Three features are apparent from an assessment of the various \npublished indicators of governance and corruption in the Philippines. First, the Philippines had \ndeclining ranks in most governance and corruption indicators since 1998, bottoming out in 2004, \nand improving since 2005, except for indicators on corruption and political stability (Table 3). \nSecond, the Philippines\u2019 scores for the quality of legislative and regulatory frameworks are \nbetter than those for implementation of such laws and service delivery (Figure 5). Third, on a \nregional  basis,  Philippines\u2019  scores  for  most  indicators  are  good,  except  for corruption  and \npolitical stability indicators (Table 4). \n \nTable 3: Update on Governance Indicators: the Philippines  \n \nYear  Voice and  Political  Government  Regulatory  Rule  Control of \nAccountability  Stability  Effectiveness  Quality  of Law  Corruption \n1996  53.6  29.8  60.2  67.8  54.8  45.1 \n1998  60.6  38.9  49.8  62.4  50.0  43.2 \n2000  54.3  21.6  49.8  56.6  35.7  36.9 \n2002  52.9  25.0  52.6  50.7  34.3  38.8 \n2004  49.5  11.1  50.2  46.8  31.4  34.0 \n2005  51.9  17.3  55.0  51.7  41.9  35.9 \n2006  45.7  11.1  54.0  50.7  44.3  22.8 \n2007  43.3  10.1  56.4  50.5  33.8  22.2 \nSource: World Bank. 2008.

Important  bureaucratic  improvements  demonstrate  that  the  Philippines \ncontinues to make progress in targeted areas of revenue collection and expenditure integrity \nunder the DPSP and other sector programs. Selected improvements include the following: \n \n(i)  The momentum in the filing of tax evasion cases increased during the second \nyear of operation of the RATE and RATS programs. \n(ii)  The Millennium Challenge Corporation TA grant of $21 million to DOF and the \nOffice of the Ombudsman (OMB) has helped strengthen governance initiatives \nthrough capacity building of staff in techniques and processes for identifying tax \nevaders  and  smugglers.  The  number  of  corporate  income  tax  returns  filed \nincreased by 12% in September 2007 over the 2005 program baseline. The \nGovernment recently surpassed the threshold for eligibility for the Millennium \nChallenge Corporation compact, which provides the Government with possible \naccess to substantial grants to support economic growth-enhancing initiatives. \n(iii)  A  key  success  is  improved  efficiency  and  transparency  in  reform  of  public \nprocurement.  The  Philippine  Government  Electronic  Procurement  System \n(PhilGEPS),  the  centralized  electronic  government  procurement  system,  is \nmandated  for  use  by  all  government  agencies,  government-owned  and  \n-controlled corporations, and LGUs. It completed its first full year of operation in \n2007, with the objective to capture data on bid opportunities and awards starting \nwith  all  12  GPPB  member  departments,  which  includes  the  major  procuring \ndepartments like public works, transportation, education, and health. \n(iv)  OMB  has  completed  an  additional  11  integrity  development  reviews  in \ngovernment agencies. It has developed action plans and established integrity \ndevelopment committees in government agencies perceived as being the most \ncorrupt by respondents to the social weather survey of 2006 (BIR, BOC, Land \nTransportation Office). \n(v)  Government-owned power sector assets worth $7.7 billion were privatized in \n2007 within a clear rules-based, transparent, and competitive framework. \n \n23.  However, perceptions about corruption persist and the Government must continue to \nmake  credible  progress  in  governance  and  anticorruption  initiatives  in  its  revenue  and \nexpenditure management programs. In this regard, beginning to institutionalize these programs \nwithin government agencies to ensure they are sustainable over the longer term will be a crucial \nundertaking for the Government.  \n \n24.  Procurement.  The  2006  country  procurement  assessment  report,26 comparing  the \nPhilippines  public  procurement  system  with  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) benchmarks, gave the Philippines a high score for its legislative and \nregulatory framework, and good scores for integrity and transparency in the public procurement \nsystem, institutional framework, and management capabilities. But the Philippines does less \nwell in procurement operations, monitoring, and enforcement (Figure 5). GPPB, responsible for \nimplementing the law, with input from development partners developed a 3-year action plan to \nensure  that  (i)  the  law  is  fully  implemented,  and  (ii)  weaknesses  identified  in  the  country \nprocurement assessment report are addressed. The action plan includes a comprehensive set \nof measures to strengthen the institutional framework, capacity building of procurement officers, \nand  enforcement.  Most  recently  the  Government  issued an  executive  order  to establish  a \nprocurement transparency group comprising government representatives from key procurement \nagencies and civil society groups. The group will track and monitor the procurement process in \n                                                 \n26 GPPB. 2007. 2006 Country Procurement Assessment Report.

Public Expenditure Management. Implementing improved systems for PEM, including \nthe MTEF, which aligns the budget planning process with strategic objectives and priorities, is \nintegral to improving PEM efficiency, and therefore sustainable priority spending. Progress is \nbeing  made.  DBM  continues  to  increase  use  of  the  MTEF  in  preparing  the  2008  budget \nincluding preparing a budget strategy paper and disseminating forward estimates for 3 years for \nall  22  departments.  The  OPIF  that  links  budget  allocations  to  management  performance \nindicators has been rolled out to all national government line departments. The second edition \nof the OPIF, Performance Budget of Departments for 2008, was submitted to Congress to \nsupport the 2008 budget proposal. The Government intends to roll out the OPIF to the rest of \ngovernment, the constitutional office, state colleges and universities, and the legislative and \njudiciary.  Additional  measures  to  increase  PEM  transparency  and  accountability  were \nimplemented by posting budget releases and disbursements of priority programs and projects of \nselected departments as well as payments made to external creditors on the DBM website. \nHowever, during implementation of subprogram 2 triggers for PEM, the Government, ADB, and \nother  development  partners  identified  several  core  areas  to  be  addressed,  beginning  with \nbudget preparation through to budget execution and reporting, which will require a much longer-\nterm and coordinated effort in capacity development (paras. 26-28). \n  \n26.  Budget  Preparation  and  Credibility.  Initial  reviews  show  several  gaps  in  budget \npreparation including the need for strengthening the multiyear perspective in fiscal planning and \nbudgeting and key to this is rolling out the MTEF to line ministries and involving them in \ncomputing the forward estimates necessary to ensure the MTEF is institutionalized within the \ngovernment. The link between the forward estimates to budget ceilings must be strengthened to \nensure fiscal discipline in the medium term. Often in-year reallocations of the approved budget \nbetween line agencies undermines the credibility of the budget composition, defined as the \nextent to which the budget is realistic and is implemented as intended. Public access to key \nfiscal information in the budget documents needs to be improved, including presentation of \nbudget documents for public consumption. Finally, revenue forecasts for budget preparation are \noften ambitiously set in most years in part arising from weaknesses in forecasting capabilities at \nDOF.  \n ", "  17\n27.  Budget  Execution  and  Controls.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  other  development \npartners have identified several gaps in budget execution to be addressed in the short and \nlonger term. These include weaknesses in recording and management of cash balances as \nmore than one treasury account makes reconciling balances difficult; monthly (and even daily) \ncash  forecasting  capabilities  of  the  Bureau  of  Treasury  to  improve  predictability  of  the \navailability of funds for commitment to expenditures during the budget cycle; payroll controls, \ninternal  controls  for  nonsalary  expenditures,  and  internal  audits  within  line  ministries,  and \noversight by Commission of Audit. DBM is in the process of establishing internal audit units \nwithin line ministries. Also of importance are the rollout of the program, establishment of the \nindependence of the internal audit units, and reporting and internal audits of special purpose \nfunds.  \n \n28.  Budget  Accounting,  Recording,  and  Reporting.  Accounts  reconciliation  lacks \ntimeliness and in-year budget reports on obligations, cash releases and allotments, obligations, \nand disbursements are not timely, and thus do not allow effective tracking of indicators of \nbudget efficiency. The key underlying cause of weaknesses in budget execution, recording, and \nreporting is the absence of an integrated government financial management information system \n(GFMIS). The current manual recording of accounts payable results in frequent reporting delays \nfrom line ministries and regions to DBM. The Government is developing the initial components \nof the GFMIS such as the eBudget (electronic releasing and programming of the budget), \neNGAS  (electronic  national  accounting  system),  and  PhilGEPS  (electronic  government \nprocurement system); but these are fragmented and, except for the PhilGEPS, coverage is low. \nIt pretested and pilot tested the e-Budget system in the first quarter of 2008 before rollout to \nregional offices. Completing the design and development of the GFMIS over the medium term \nwill  be  important  to  enhance  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  services  and  improve \ntransparency. \n \n3.  Investment Climate \n29.  Investment Growth. While investment showed healthy signs of recovery in 2007, much \nneeds to be done to place it on a sustainable path. ADB staff estimates suggest that the \nPhilippines is underinvesting in physical capital by as much as 5 percentage points of GDP \ncompared with its long-run equilibrium rate. The Government\u2019s increased public spending on \ninfrastructure has increased the investment rate (Figure 6). It will need to continue this to reach \nrates on par with regional neighbors of about 5% of GDP, and to implement measures to \nincrease private investment, such as improving the investment climate (lowering regulatory \ncosts), trade facilitation, and rural development; and establishing a transparent framework for \ninfrastructure development, including improving the resource efficiency of public infrastructure \nspending as a corollary to fiscal consolidation efforts. \n \n ", "18    \n \nFigure 6: Investment Growth\n60\npublic construction\n40\n20 private construction\n0\n1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006\n-20\n-40\n-60 Source: National Statistical Coordination Board\n \n. \n \n30.  Regulatory Costs. The 2007 Philippines: Critical Development Constraints27 reiterates \nthe importance of investment (both physical and human capital) to sustain high economic \ngrowth in the long run. The report highlights several critical constraints to growth, including tight \nfiscal space; inadequate infrastructure, particularly in electricity and transport; and governance \nconcerns. The Doing Business 2008 report28 indicates the time and cost involved in launching a \nbusiness in the Philippines in 2007 did not improve from 2006. The devolution of licensing \nfunctions to LGUs, a cumbersome business registry system, duplication of functions between \nnational  agencies  and  LGUs,  and  proliferation  of  laws  related  to  fiscal  incentives  have \ncontributed  to  relatively  high  regulatory  costs.  The  Government  is  gradually  developing \nregulations in some sectors, but in an ad hoc manner as no government-wide system is in place \nto systematically review the regulatory impacts of proposals by decision makers.29 The National \nCompetitiveness  Council  has  drafted  and  advocated  a  framework  for  institutionalizing  a \nregulatory impact assessment within government and to guide the formulation of an action plan \n(paras. 56 and 64).  \n \n31.  Trade Facilitation. In the early 1990s, the Philippines undertook major trade policy \nreforms including reducing average import tariff rates to about 8% in 2000, and dismantled most \n(but not all) nontariff barriers. Trade facilitation costs remain relatively high. Depending on the \nproduct, exporters and importers must deal with several different government agencies to obtain \npermits. In all, about 40 different government agencies issue regulations or permits on exporting \nand importing goods. Until recently, the Department of Agriculture had five separate agencies \ndealing with certification of different kinds of commodities. The Philippines is not yet a member \nof  the  Kyoto  Protocol  for  Customs  that  promotes  transparency  and  efficiency  in  customs \nprocedures and operations. Customs has not yet completed the full rollout of Asycuda, the \ncustoms information management system, which promotes arms-length transactions between \nimporters and customs officials, and produces timely trade and customs data collection. As an \narchipelago nation, relatively low trade facilitation costs are crucial for competitiveness (para 33). \n \n32.  Rural Investment Climate. The Critical Development Constraints report (footnote 28) \nhighlights constraints in the rural economy that have been a drag on investment and poverty \n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2007.

The 2007 midterm progress report on achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals30 reiterates the need to improve the rural investment climate, especially connectivity \nbetween farmers and urban markets and the creation of an enabling environment for developing \noff-farm income-generating activities, as key to lowering poverty in rural regions. Constraints to \nrural investment and poverty reduction include poor rural road infrastructure, costly shipping, \nand logistics. Protection from imports is relatively high in the agriculture sector, and especially \nhigh for rice milling, coffee, pig raising, and sugar and sugar milling, resulting in higher costs to \ndownstream producers and consumers (Appendix 4). Recent international evidence is pointing \nto the positive role of supermarkets in rural economy development through investments in \nefficient procurement practices, distribution centers, contract farming, and export channels. The \nGovernment partially deregulated the retail sector in 2000, but remaining restrictions still deter \nforeign investment. The recent surge in food prices has refocused attention on the inefficient \nsubsidy programs and the need for policies to improve agricultural productivity, connectivity \nbetween the rural and urban economies, and the rural investment climate and infrastructure. \nADB assistance in this sector has helped address some of these rural investment climate issues, \ne.g., the Infrastructure for Rural Productivity Enhancement Sector Project (footnote 11). ADB \nhas  programs  in  the pipeline  including  project  preparatory  TA  for the  proposed  integrated \nnatural resources and environmental management sector development program, which includes \nthe formulation of an uplands development strategy. \n \n33.  Inadequate  Infrastructure.  Studies  and  surveys  on  the  Philippines  indicate  trade \nfacilitation costs (from factory to port) are relatively high on a regional basis. The World Bank\u2019s \nlogistics performance index ranks Philippines 65 out of 150 countries.31 A breakdown of the \ncosts shows that costs related to infrastructure (road, rail, and domestic shipping) account for \nthe higher costs. The logistics survey shows that the Philippines performs well in terms of \ncustoms facilitation (ranked 53 out of 150 countries), domestic logistics costs (rank 19), and \ninternational shipments (rank 63); but below the median for infrastructure (rank 86). Public \nspending on infrastructure at about 2.7% of GDP in 2007 is at half its average in the 1990s. \nThus,  increasing  infrastructure  spending  is  crucial  to  lowering  domestic  and  foreign  trade \nfacilitation  costs  and  therefore  economic  growth.  In  2007,  the  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment  Agency  (NEDA),  the  Government  planning  agency,  identified  and  presented \nprojects at the PDF\u2014a positive step for increasing infrastructure investment. Much more needs \nto be done to encourage private sector participation in infrastructure, including public\u2013private \npartnerships, by reducing risks and uncertainty, clarifying rights and obligations in joint ventures \nbetween private and public sectors in infrastructure investments, and standardizing procedures. \nThe Bureau of Treasury law needs to be revised to ensure transparency of policies relating to \naward of concessions, issuance of public guarantees, and provision of public subsidies. This will \nincrease  the  confidence  of  private  operators  and  financiers  in  government  commitments. \nTransaction quality needs to be ensured through a transparent project preparation and bidding \nprocess, and timely contract completion through better performance management by project \nmanagers and appropriate links to incentives and sanctions to minimize cost overruns.  \n \n                                                 \n30 Asian Development Bank, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and United Nations \nDevelopment Programme. 2007.

The \npoor are heavily concentrated in agriculture, or the nonwage (informal) sector. In contrast, the \nnonpoor are more likely to be in wage employment in the nonagriculture sector. While the \nnonpoor are more likely to benefit from remittances sent by family members working overseas, \nADB  staff  estimates  still  suggest  that  remittances  reduced  the  national  poverty  rate  by  \n5 percentage points (Supplementary Appendix B). Disparities in the incidence of poverty across \nregions are significant. A negative relationship exists between subnational per capita GDP and \npoverty  incidence.  Poverty  incidence  is  low  in  the  National  Capital  Region,  Central  and \nSouthern Luzon, Ilocos, and Central Visayas, where per capita GDP is above the national \nmedian. Much higher poverty incidence is recorded in regions with relatively low per capita GDP, \nsuch  as  the  Autonomous  Region  of  Muslim  Mindanao,  Mindanao,  Bicol,  and  Eastern  and \nWestern Visayas. A look at poverty magnitude\u2014the total number of poor people\u2014presents a \nsomewhat different picture of regional disparities, as the areas with low poverty incidence tend \nto have larger populations, and vice versa. About one in five poor Filipinos live in the National \nCapital Region and the surrounding provinces (e.g., Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Quezon, Rizal, \nZambales). \n \n35.  Millennium Development Goals. The 2007 midterm progress report on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (footnote 31) indicates that halfway to the 2015 target year, the Philippines \nhas made considerable progress in some areas (particularly in reducing poverty; improving \ngender equality; reducing child mortality; combating HIV, AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; \nand improving access to safe drinking water and sanitary toilet facilities). However, challenges \ncontinue in  the  areas of  universal  access  to  education,  maternal  mortality,  and  access to \nreproductive health services. Access to primary education has dropped. The net enrolment rate \nfell from 97% in 2000 to 84% in the 2005/06 school year, representing a setback to the 2015 \ntarget of universal access. The report shows uneven progress and wide disparities across \nregions. Most of the lagging regions and provinces are in Mindanao, while the frontrunners are \nin Luzon. The National Capital Region, Ilocos Region (Region 1), Cagayan Valley (Region 2), \nWestern Visayas (Region 6), Central Visayas (Region 7), and Southern Mindanao (Region 11) \nconsistently lead for most indicators. The rest of the country\u2019s regions lag in most of the targets. \nTable 5 presents a snapshot of Philippine progress compared with its regional neighbors.  \n \nTable 5: Progress on Millennium Development Goals: Regional Comparison \n \nGoal  1    2      3      4    5      6       \n \n$1/day poverty  Underweight children  Primary Enrolment  Reaching grade 5  Primary completion  Gender primary  Gender y secondar Gender tertiary  Under 5 ortality m Infant mortality HIV prevalence  TB prevalence TB death rate Water urban  Water rural  Sanitation urban  Sanitation rural \nIndonesia  \u2022  \u2207  \u2022  \u0398  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u0398  \u0394  \u0394  \u0394  \u2022  \u2022  \u2207  \u0398  \u0398  \u0398 \nMalaysia  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u0398  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2207  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022   \nPhilippines  \u0398  \u0398  \u2207  \u2207  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u0394  \u0394  \u0394  \u2022  \u2022  \u2207  \u0398  \u0394  \u0398 \nThailand  \u2022    \u0394      \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u0394  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022 \nViet Nam    \u2022  \u2207  \u0394  \u2207  \u0398  \u2022  \u2207  \u2022  \u2022  \u2207  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u0394 \n\u2022 Early achiever; \u0394 On track; \u0398 Slow; \u2207 No progress or regressing. \nSource: Asian Development Bank, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and United Nations \nDevelopment Programme. 2007.

Poverty  reduction  programs  should  focus  on  the \ndimensions of poverty highlighted in paras.  34 and 35. The Government will need to increase \ninvestment in education and infrastructure, particularly in the MDG lagging regions. Targeted \npoverty reduction programs, such as the proposed conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, are \na useful way to link social assistance with human capital development. The success of this \ndemand-side intervention will, to a large extent, depend on supply-side readiness, i.e., the \navailability of quality education and health services in the CCT program areas.  \n \n37.  Catching Up with the MDGs. Fiscal austerity measures introduced from 2001 to 2006 \nto reduce the Government deficit disproportionately hurt social policy expenditures. This is one \nof the reasons the Philippines is having difficulty meeting some of its MDG targets, particularly \nthose in education and health. During 2001\u20132005, the share of central Government spending on \nthe social sector was 22% in the Philippines, compared with 45% in Thailand and 37% in \nMalaysia (footnote 32). The share of public expenditure on education fell from 3.0% of GDP in \n1991 to 2.7% in 2005, as compared to 6.2% in Malaysia and 4.2% in Thailand. In 2004, public \nexpenditure on health as a share of GDP was 1.4% in the Philippines compared with 2.2% in \nMalaysia and 2.3% in Thailand.32 Weak governance and inequality in resource allocation have \nalso  contributed  to  poor  social  sector  outcomes.  The  Government  is  well  aware  of  these \nproblems and is committed to improving quality and access to basic education and health care, \nreversing recent declines in performance. The 2007 budget allocated substantial real increases \nto the social sector (6% over the 2006 budget). The proposed budget for 2008 increased \nallocations to the education and health sectors by about 11%. The increased share for the \nDepartment  of  Education  (DepEd)  will  provide  larger  allocations  for  teacher  recruitment, \ntextbooks, new school buildings, and repair and maintenance of existing schools; this is to \nwiden coverage and improve quality. The Government intends to move to a needs-based \nformula for allocating school funding. In the health sector, the Government adopted the Formula \nOne for Health implementation framework for health sector reforms in the medium term (2005\u2013\n2010). The overall goal is to improve the quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity of the \nhealth system, particularly for the poor. ADB\u2019s Health Sector Development Program (footnote 12) \noffers one example of how systematic provincial public expenditure reviews and the use of \nprogrammatic initiatives can help effect improvements to local service delivery. \n \n38.  Social Protection. ADB actively participated in policy dialogue on social sector issues in \n2007 primarily through the PDF Working Group on MDGs and Social Progress. In a number of \nworking sessions in 2006 and 2007, the subgroup on social protection, led by the Department of \nSocial Welfare and Development (DSWD), refined the definition of social protection, using the \nADB definition as a model. In February 2007, NEDA issued Social Development Committee \nResolution No. 1, series of 2007, on Adopting a Philippine Definition of Social Protection. The \nresolution recognizes the need for a common framework in designing and implementing social \nprotection programs, and sets out that social protection \u201cconstitutes policies and programs that \nseek to reduce poverty and vulnerability to risks and enhance the social status and rights of the \nmarginalized  by  promoting  and  protecting  livelihood  and  employment,  protecting  against \nhazards and sudden loss of income, and improving people\u2019s capacity to manage risks.\u201d The four \ncomponents of social protection are (i) labor market programs, or measures aimed at enhancing \nemployment opportunities and protection, and the rights and welfare of workers; (ii) social \ninsurance, or programs that seek to mitigate income risks by pooling resources and spreading \nrisks across time and classes; (iii) social welfare, or preventive and development interventions \nthat seek to support the minimum basic requirements of the poor; and (iv) social safety nets and \nstop-gap mechanisms, or urgent responses that address effects of economic shocks, disasters, \n                                                 \n32  United Nations Development Programme. 2007.

The resolution includes examples of each of these \ncomponents  and  recommends  that  all  concerned  government  entities  adopt  and  use  the \ndefinition. \n \n39.  Conditional Cash Transfer Program. With the aim of refining targeted programs for \npoverty reduction, in 2007, DSWD designed a new CCT program, known as the Pantawid \nPamilyang  Pilipino  Program.  The  program  falls  under  the  social  welfare  category  of  the \nPhilippine definition of social protection. With more than a decade of implementation experience \nand  proven  results,  particularly  in  Latin  America,  CCT  programs  provide  income  support \nconditional on human capital investments, such as sending children to school or attending \nhealth clinics, thus reducing the risk of future poverty. CCTs have additional benefits that \ninclude  reduced  child  labor  and,  as  cash  benefits  are  often  paid  directly  to  mothers,  the \nempowerment of women. The program goal is to build the human capital of children aged 0\u201314 \nfrom the poorest families. The cash grants will be linked to five conditions: (i) pregnant women \nreceive pre- and postnatal care beginning in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, and the birth is \nattended by a skilled health professional; (ii) parents attend parent effectiveness service classes; \n(iii)  children  aged  0\u20135  receive  regular  preventive  health  checkups  and  vaccines;  \n(iv) children aged 3\u20135 attend day-care or preschool programs; and (v) children aged 6\u201314 are \nenrolled in school and demonstrate at least an 85% attendance rate. These conditions are \nselected to address the persistent human development bottlenecks, including high infant, child, \nand maternal mortality rates; malnutrition; low completion rates in primary education and low \nprogression to secondary education; and high prevalence of child labor. The CCT program was \npiloted tested from June to December 2007 covering 6,000 households in the provinces of \nAgusan del Sur and Misamis Occidental, and the cities of Pasay and Caloocan. Two targeting \ninstruments are being tested in the prepilot: the community-based monitoring system (CBMS) \nand a proxy means test. DSWD recognizes that using uniform, objective, and transparent \ncriteria to select beneficiaries is crucial for the success of the program. With the recent external \nprice  shocks,  the  Government  has  decided  to  scale  up  the  program  to  cover  321,000 \nhouseholds nationwide. \n \nC.  Lessons \n40.  In  the  process  of  assessing  implementation  progress  of  triggers  for  subprogram  2 \n(Appendix 7), several lessons were identified for formulating subprogram 2 and designing policy \ntriggers for subprogram 3. These include the following:  \n \n(i)  Numerical targets such as the tax revenue to GDP ratio should be cautiously \nused as triggers. Numerical targets that are ambitiously set and not supported by \na realistic reform timetable are likely to fail.  \n(ii)  If necessary, triggers should be supported by TA, such as the subprogram 2 \nPEM triggers.  \n(iii)  The  Government  and  ADB  identified  gaps  in  Government  budget  execution, \ninternal audit and controls, and reporting underpinned by an underdeveloped \ngovernment computerized accounts system. The Government asked ADB for \nlonger-term integrated TA to strengthen the Government\u2019s PEM framework. \n(iv)  The  program  cluster  with  triggers  contains  adequate  flexibility  to  respond  to \nlessons identified during implementation and to incorporate new Government \npolicy priorities such as the CCT program (para. 39). Once rolled out, the CCT \nprogram  will  be  an  important  vehicle  for  social  assistance  in  response  to \neconomic shocks, such as the recent surge in food price inflation. \n ", "  23\n(v)  The Government has implemented several important fiscal, governance, and \nanticorruption programs, such as the MTEF in DBM, RATEs program at BIR, and \nthe OMB\u2019s integrity development reviews. Going forward, institutionalizing priority \nprograms within agencies will be important to ensure long-term sustainability. \n(vi)  Judicial reform is important to increase judicial performance and credibility in tax \nprosecution cases. ADB is assisting tax prosecution through TA on tax revenue \ncollection. This will complement the proposed governance and justice reform \nprogram, which lays out a longer-term reform program and capacity building in \nthe justice subsector (footnote 7). \n \n41.  As a result, subprogram 2 incorporates several new important policy accomplishments \nthat have enhanced the Government\u2019s agenda in the four core areas, as well as addresses \nimplementation difficulties with some triggers identified during implementation. Subprogram 3 \nwill focus attention on institutionalizing priority programs of the Government with greater weight \non investment climate, poverty reduction, and PEM. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n42.  The  impact  of  the  subprogram  2  will  be  sustained  economic  expansion,  lower \nunemployment,  and  reduced  poverty  through  improved  fiscal  sustainability,  public  financial \nmanagement, a better investment climate, and improved delivery of public services. \n \n43.  The DPSP cluster includes a series of policy reforms that underpin the key priorities of \nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda. These reforms are designed to accomplish the following:  \n \n(i)  Improve  fiscal  sustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability,  and \nimprove creditworthiness by enhancing the quality of fiscal management by \n(a) increasing  tax  revenues  annually  for  the  next  2  years  (i.e.,  2008\u20132009) \nthrough tax policy reforms; (b) strengthening tax administration and enforcement, \nand  reducing  revenue  leakages  through  improved  governance;  (c)  reducing \ninefficient spending to permit increased social and poverty-related spending; and \n(d)  strengthening  the  debt  management  strategy  to  manage  government \ncontingent liabilities and risks prudently. \n(ii)  Enhance governance in PEM by (a) improving PEM from budget preparation \nthrough  to  budget  execution,  accounting,  recording,  and  reporting;  \n(b)  strengthening  performance  management  and  improving  public  service \ndelivery;  (c)  reforming  procurement;  and  (d)  implementing  anticorruption  and \nenforcement  strategies  for  revenue-collecting  agencies  and  key  procurement \nagencies.  \n(iii)  Improve  the  investment  climate  and  promote  rural  development  by  \n(a)  clarifying  and  strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for \ninvestments and trade, (b) facilitating infrastructure development through greater \npublic\u2013private  participation  and  greater  coordination  of  public  infrastructure \ninvestments, and (c) improving rural\u2013urban connectivity.  \n(iv)  Reduce  poverty  and  increase  social  inclusion  by  improving  the  policy \nframework for social protection, sustaining real spending on health and education, \nimproving targeting of programs, improving service delivery, and introducing the \nCCT program tied to performance outcomes in child education and health.  \n \n ", "24    \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n \n44.  The  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  for  subprogram  1  of  the  DPSP \nidentified  11  policy  triggers  for  subprogram  2  (footnote  1).  In  the  process  of  assessing \nimplementation progress, the Government proposed a few key changes (Appendix 7 provides \nan assessment of subprogram 2 triggers): \n \n(i)  Tax revenue to GDP. While the tax trigger is assessed as partially accomplished \nas  tax  revenue  collection  recovered  to  14%  growth  for  the  \n12  months  ending  June  2008  and  therefore  the  tax  revenue  to  GDP  ratio \nincreased by about 0.26%, the Government asked to eliminate this numerical \ntrigger  and  shift  the  focus  to  remedial  actions  to  enhance  tax  collection  in \nsubprogram  2  and  priority  revenue-enhancing  measures  in  subprogram  3  to \nachieve its medium-term revenue targets. In this way, the Philippine DPSP is \naligned to ADB\u2019s approach taken in Indonesia, which avoids setting numerical \ntargets  as  triggers  and  instead  focuses on  broad  policy  measures aimed  at \nenhancing revenue sustainability. Numerical targets are appropriately monitored \nthrough the design and monitoring framework.33 The Philippine DPSP specifies \nthe medium-term tax revenue to GDP target of 15% by 2010.   \n(ii)  Social  protection.  The  Government  recommended  adding  a  new  trigger  to \nreflect emerging policy priorities in 2007. The Government views strengthening \nprograms to the poor and vulnerable groups as a priority in view of the country\u2019s \nvulnerability to frequent natural disasters, and recent exogenous shocks to the \neconomy  such  as  the  surge  in  food  price  inflation.  In  this  context,  the \nGovernment proposed a new trigger on social protection, namely, adopting a \nnew definition of social protection to lay the groundwork for better programs and \nreforms over the medium term (para. 38).  \n(iii)  Support  for  the  procurement  reform. During 2007, the Government asked \nADB to increase attention on the procurement reform program and, in particular, \nsupport for its transparency measures. As a result, the subprograms 2 and 3 \ninclude additional reform measures for procurement, including establishment and \noperationalization of the procurement transparency group. \n \n45.  In total, the Government and ADB are focusing on 11 policy triggers (Appendix 2, policy \nmatrix).  Most are supported by 26 measures to clearly outline a blueprint for government \nimplementing agencies to follow and execute, while a few measures have definitive outputs \n(e.g.,  establish  a  body,  action  plan,  and  capacity  building  and  training  programs).  The \nGovernment has made substantial progress in completing these measures. Of the 11 triggers, it \nhas fully or substantially accomplished 9, and partially accomplished 2. All of the 26 other \nmeasures were accomplished in 2007 and 2008. \n \n46.  Progress in achieving the DPSP performance indicators and targets set out in the design \nand monitoring framework for subprogram 1 and updated for subprogram 2 (Appendix 1) has \nbeen substantial. Of the 18 performance indicators, 6 are assessed as early achievements (i.e., \nsurpassed or expected to surpass medium-term targets set for the end of the program cluster in \n2009), 8 are on track to achieve medium-term targets, one has progressed slowly, two have \n                                                 \n33  The Indonesian DPSP 3 includes a tax revenue policy trigger as follows: Improve value-added tax by reducing the \ntime for refunds. The trigger does not specify a numerical target, but is monitored through a performance target in \nthe design and monitoring framework that specifies. Reduce the time to obtain [value-added tax] refund from 12 to \n18 months. ADB. 2007.

In the spirit of the DPSP cluster, which aims to support the Government\u2019s policy reform \nagenda  on  a  continuous  basis  rather  than  through  predetermined  rigid  conditions,  the \nGovernment asked that the substantial progress be recognized. Furthermore, as individual \nloans under the DPSP cluster are sequenced to provide continuous support in a predictable \nmanner, it asked ADB and the development partners to remain fully engaged as part of the \nongoing  dialogue,  support  and  continuously  monitor  implementation  and  completion  of  the \nremaining policy trigger, and provide longer-term TA for strengthening PEM capacity. ADB\u2019s \nprogram cluster approach provides for such flexibility in reform programs that are implemented \nover time, by taking emerging circumstances into account. \n \n1.  Accomplishments under Subprogram 2 \n48.  Subprogram 2 focuses on four of the seven core policy areas outlined by the PDF: \nimprove fiscal sustainability, maintain macroeconomic stability, and improve creditworthiness; \nimprove governance in PEM and reduce corruption; strengthen the investment climate and rural \ndevelopment; and reduce poverty and increase social inclusion.  \n \na.  Improve  Fiscal  Sustainability,  Maintain  Macroeconomic  Stability, \nand Improve Creditworthiness \n49.  Fiscal Discipline. The Government\u2019s immediate objectives are to balance the budget by \n2010 and reduce nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) debt to 65% of GDP by 2009. In 2007 (i) \nreduction of the national government deficit to 0.2% of GDP in 2007, a consolidated public \nsector surplus in 2006, and a deficit of 0.1% in 2007 surpassed program expectations and \ncontributed significantly to the recent upgrade of the country\u2019s credit rating by Standard & Poor\u2019s \nin early 2008; and (ii) corresponding with the improved budget situation, nonfinancial sector \npublic debt fell from 87% of GDP in 2005 to 74% in 2006 and 67% in 2007 on track to exceed \nthe Government\u2019s medium-term target of 65% of GDP by 2009, and return to debt levels of the \nearly 1990s. The national government debt decreased from 72% in 2005, to 64% in 2006, and \n59% in 2007. \n50.  Tax Revenue Sustainability. While tax revenues fell short of budget targets in 2007, \nrecovery occurred in the second semester of 2007 and continued through to the first 6 months \nof  2008  to  partially  bring  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  tax  targets  back  on  track.  The \nrecovery in tax revenues was achieved by remedial actions including increased inspections and \nuse  of  legislative  instruments  such  as  tax  amnesties  to  recover  taxes  in  arrears.  During \nsubprogram  2,  the  Government  initiated  medium-term  actions  for  revenue  sustainability \nincluding DOF\u2019s submission of its revised investment incentives rationalization bill, which aims \nto streamline investment incentives, to the new Congress at the end of 2007. Congress is \nexpected to pass the bill in 2008. While tax administration reforms were slow to begin, progress \nincludes cleaning the taxpayer database, identifying unregistered corporations (about 9,429 \nregistered at the Securities and Exchange Commission) and inactive taxpayers in the database \n(162,352 taxpayers), and beginning to address the backlog of registrations. \n \n ", "26    \n \n51.  Debt Management. Based on a report outlining options for a debt management strategy \nor system, produced with ADB assistance, the Government proposes the establishment of a \ndebt and risk management division in its rationalization plan submitted to DBM. \n \nb.  Improve Governance in PEM and Reduce Corruption \n52.  Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. The Government\u2019s immediate objectives are \nto implement the MTEF and OPIF, and improve transparency in budget planning and execution. \nThe 2008 budget is based on a more refined MTEF drawn from an improved budget strategy \npaper  and  forward  estimates  for  2008\u20132010  developed  with  all  22  departments  and  their \nattached agencies. The indicative budget ceilings for departments and agencies based on \nforward estimates were issued for the first time. The MTEF promotes fiscal discipline by setting \nforward budget estimates for agencies (over 3 years), which promotes strategic prioritization of \nmedium-term  spending  objectives,  supported  by  the  budget  strategy  paper  that  analyses \nspending constraints and options for government. The Government continued to strengthen \npublic sector performance management through the rollout of the performance-based budgeting \nprocess  by  DBM  through  the  adoption  of  the  OPIF,  which  identifies  the  contribution  and \nalignment of programs and activities of line agencies to their major final outputs that directly \nsupport national and sector goals. The Government has now rolled out the OPIF to all 22 \ndepartments, incorporated OPIF implementation in the 2008 budget, and incorporated the OPIF \nin the 2009 budget call. The Government printed the second edition of the OPIF book for 2008. \n \n53.  Transparency in Budget Execution. DBM has made gradual progress in improving \ntransparency in the budget with the following key measures in 2007 and 2008. DBM posted on \nits website detailed 2007 data on all payments to contractors for central offices and four pilot \nregions of the DepEd, DOA, DOH, and DPWH. A link with the DPWH website was established \nas payments to contractors are uploaded on the DPWH website. The Government encountered \ndifficulties implementing this policy trigger due to the underdeveloped government financial \ninformation management system. Consequently, to accomplish this trigger DBM had to scan all \ndocuments from the agencies and then post them on its website, requiring considerable time \nand human resources. This underpinned the necessity of developing an integrated GFMIS. The \npolicy trigger on detailed data on allotments and quarterly cash releases by central offices of \nDepEd,  DOA,  DOH,  and  DPWH.  disclosed  retroactively  on  the  DBM  website encountered \nsimilar difficulties. Hence, DBM elected to publish data on the allotment releases, obligations, \nand disbursements on the major programs and projects of the four departments for 2007. To the \nextent that data could be secured on the outputs and impacts of these projects, these data were \nalso posted to signify the Government\u2019s thrust to greater results orientation and accountability. \nFinally, DOH submitted its 2008 budget proposal to DBM based on a new budget structure \nconsistent  with  its  major  final  output.  Three  other  departments  (DepEd,  DOA,  DPWH) \ndesignated to submit budget proposals on the new budget structure under subprogram 2 were \nunable to do so as DBM had not approved their rationalization plans. However, the Government \nremains committed to restructuring department budgets in line with major final outputs under the \nOPIF to improve the budget\u2019s readability and performance focus. \n \n54.  Procurement. The following set of key measures was undertaken in 2007 and 2008 to \nimprove transparency and efficiency in public procurement. The PhilGEPS completed its first \nyear of full operation, with all bid notices and more than 77% of all procurement results (award \nnotices,  failed  bids,  canceled  bids,  and  short-listed  bids)  posted\u2014a  major  achievement  in \nimproving transparency and competition in procurement. The Government issued Executive \nOrder 662A to create a procurement transparency group to promote public monitoring and \nenhance transparency of the public procurement system, as mandated under the procurement \n ", "  27\nlaw. The group comprises representatives from GPPB, key procurement agencies, and six civil \nsociety organizations (CSOs) nominated by the CSO Forum, a voluntary gathering of major \nCSOs.  The  six  CSOs  are  the  Bishops\u2013Businessmen  Conference,  Makati  Business  Club, \nTransparency and Accountability Network, Ateneo Government Watch, Confederation of Filipino \nConsultants,  and  Procurement  Watch  The  procurement  transparency  group  will  be \noperationalized  under  subprogram  3  and  will  start  with  tracking  procurement  of  selected \ninfrastructure projects from the time the bid notice is posted to selection of the winning bid. \nGPPB produced a 3-year action plan for 2007/10 with concrete measures to implement the \n2003 procurement law. \n \n55.  Expenditure  Integrity.  OMB  and  DBM  completed  integrity  development  reviews  in  \n11 agencies in 2007, in addition to 5 completed under subprogram 1. The reviews use a \ncorruption diagnostic instrument that examines an agency's practices and procedures for their \nvulnerability to corruption. OMB has placed resident officers in the departments to help develop \nand implement an action plan on a voluntary basis, as buy-in from the department is considered \nnecessary for successful implementation. To implement and monitor progress on action plans in \nthe agencies, OMB has established integrity development committees in BIR, BOC, DOH, \nDPWH, LRA, and LTO. The committees include membership from the CSOs. All six agencies \nare in different stages of implementing their action plans; DOH is currently the most advanced. \nFinally, subprogram 2 supports the Government\u2019s efforts to reduce revenue leakage through its \nanticorruption and collusion initiatives such as RATE, RATS, and revenue integrity protection \nsystem (RIPS). As of December 2007, cases filed with the Department of Justice included  \n112 cases for tax evaders filed under the RATE program; 52 smuggling cases filed under RATS, \nof which 11 cases have been filed with the Court of Tax Appeals; and 70 cases filed under RIPS. \nAs of September 2007. OMB has suspended 18 officials charged by the RIPS program. To \nimprove investigation and prosecution of tax and graft cases, the Government with assistance \nfrom the Millennium Challenge Corporation has strengthened OMB and DOF, and as a result \nincreased  the  conviction  rate  of  cases  filed  by  OMB  before  the  anticorruption  court,  the \nSandiganbayan, from 25% in September 2006 to 56% for 2007. An objective of the RATE \nprogram is to increase the number of individual and corporate tax returns filed with BIR. By \nSeptember 2007, individual tax returns had increased by 4% from the baseline 487,594 returns \nreported in 2005, and corporate income tax returns were up by 12% in 2007 from 134,151 in \n2005. \n \nc.  Strengthen the Investment Climate and Infrastructure \n56.  Investment Climate Reforms and Infrastructure. The Government\u2019s main objective is \nto increase the share of investment and infrastructure spending in the GDP. Reform areas of \ncritical significance targeted under the DPSP include (i) clarifying and strengthening the legal \nand regulatory framework for investments; and (ii) facilitating infrastructure development, and \npromoting rural development through a better investment climate. Subprogram 2 supports the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  business  transaction  costs  in  2007.  The  National \nCompetitiveness  Council  drafted  and  advocated  a  framework  for  addressing  bureaucracy \nthrough a regulatory review assessment with assistance from ADB TA on competitiveness. The \nframework  will  provide  the  basis  for  an  action  plan  to  institutionalize  regulatory  review \nassessments within government under subprogram 3. The Government issued Circular No. 137 \n(30 July 2007) mandating NEDA to approve national agency proposals for changes to fees and \ncharges, and streamlined visa procedures for foreign investors. The Department of Trade and \nIndustry continues to advocate for improvements in LGU business registration by publishing a \nhandbook on best practices. To improve the policy framework for infrastructure investments, the \n ", "28    \n \nNEDA Infrastructure Committee submitted a list of priority investment projects to DBM at the \nstart of budget preparation. \n \nd.  Reduce Poverty and Increase Social Inclusion \n57.  The DPSP supports the Government\u2019s agenda to improve the social sectors by \nincreasing  funding,  improving  governance  in  the  budget  process  and  procurement, \nengaging civil society in monitoring procurement, and improving targeting of poverty \nreduction programs. Reform areas of critical significance targeted under subprogram 2 include \n(i) NEDA issued Social Development Committee Resolution No. 1, series of 2007, on Adopting \na  Philippine  Definition  of  Social  Protection,  which  lays  the  foundation  for  reforming  social \nprotection programs and assistance (para. 38); (ii) the Government continued the rollout of the \nCBMS  for  poverty;  as  of  March  2008,  32  cities,  and  46  provinces  (21  provincewide)  had \nadopted the CBMS, and more than 11,758 barangays (communities) were at varying stages of \nimplementation; and (iii) DSWD designed the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, a CCT \nprogram  where  benefits  are  linked  to  meeting  selected  education,  health,  and  nutrition \nrequirements; and pilot tested it from June to December 2007 covering 6,000 of the poorest \nhouseholds in the provinces of Agusan del Sur and Misamis Occidental, and the cities of Pasay \nand Caloocan.  \n \n2.  Triggers for Subprogram 3 \n58.  The development policy letter sets out the Government reform agenda for the next  \n1\u20132 years, building on the reform momentum of subprograms 1 and 2. Triggers for subprogram \n3 are described in Appendix 2. \n \na.  Improve Fiscal Sustainability, Macroeconomic Stability, and \nCreditworthiness \n \n59.  Fiscal Policy. Subprogram 3 has four fiscal triggers. The first two are to achieve a \nnational government budget deficit of not more than 1% in 2008 and remain on track to achieve \na balanced consolidated public sector budget. Subprogram 3 recognizes that some flexibility in \nthe budget balances is necessary to protect priority spending in the social sectors (education, \nhealth, and social assistance) and infrastructure in the event the economy slows down faster \nthan expected and the surge in food rice inflation has a material impact on the welfare of the \npoor. The third trigger is to establish the debt and risk management office as a middle office to \nintegrate debt management functions in DOF. \n \n60.  Tax Administration. The fourth trigger is to complete the cleaning of the corporate \ntaxpayer database initiated under subprogram 2, and make substantial progress in encoding the \nbacklog of tax registration and tax return files. \n \n61.  Impact and Outcomes. By the end of 2009, the DPSP-supported program is expected \nto have improved the Philippines macroeconomic fundamentals and economic growth rate. \nFiscal  sustainability  will  have  improved  by  2010  as  reflected  by  the  balanced  national \ngovernment and consolidated public sector budgets. Public debt will have fallen, supported by \nthe mobilization of additional tax revenues of 0.9 percentage points of GDP over this period. \nCorresponding  with  revenue  mobilization,  public  expenditure  increased  by  1.0  percentage \npoints. \n \n ", "  29\nb.  Strengthen Governance in Public Expenditure Management \n \n62.  There are six triggers to support institutionalization of governance programs focus on \nkey aspects of developing an efficient PEM system, internal control, and greater transparency in \nprocurement. The first trigger will continue the rollout of the MTEF by ensuring that forward \nestimates produced by DBM include greater information on and linkage to program outputs from \ndepartments and agencies to strengthen the interrelationship between the MTEF and OPIF. A \nsupporting milestone includes the computerization of forward estimates, which would allow \ntimely computation of budget ceilings by line ministries. The second trigger will be DBM initiating \ndevelopment of the GFMIS starting with a diagnostics of the GFMIS scope and requirements. A \nsupporting milestone will be to produce a longer-term PEM reform program supported by TA \nfrom ADB and other development partners. The next two triggers will continue progress in \nimproving transparency in procurement with greater involvement of CSOs. These two triggers \nrelate to expanding the coverage of the PhilGEPS to three non-GPPB member departments \n(Department of Environment and Natural Resources, DENR, DOA, and DSWD) in 2009 in \ncompliance with the procurement law. This will require significant process changes in the three \ndepartments to ensure compliance with the PhilGEPS. The Government will expand coverage \nto the remaining seven national departments in 2010 (these departments have relatively low \nprocurement budgets). GPPB will operationalize the procurement transparency group and start \ntracking selected infrastructure projects. The fifth trigger starts reforms of internal controls, \nformulation of national guidelines for internal control standards, and pilots of the guidelines in \none department and one agency. The final trigger is to institutionalize the RATE program by \nstrengthening it with permanent staff, budget, operating procedures and guidelines, and training \nprogram. \n \n63.  Impact and Outcomes. By the end of 2009, the DPSP is expected to have improved \nthe  budget  allocation  of  resources  and  efficiency  through  strengthened  institutional  and \nreporting frameworks by linking the medium-term development plan and/or priorities of national \ndepartments  with  the  budget  process  (via  the  MTEF).  This  will  improve  performance \nmanagement  and  the  delivery  of  public  services,  and  lead  to  greater  transparency, \naccountability, and monitoring of public procurement. More departments will have an MTEF, and \ncompleted  the  rollout  of  the  OPIF  to  constitutional  bodies  (e.g.,  state  universities).  The \nGovernment made progress in developing the GFMIS to improve efficiency in budget execution, \nrecording, and reporting. Internal control will be established in two agencies with the rollout to \nother line ministries beginning in 2009. All publicly bid opportunities and awards of central \noffices of 22 national departments will be posted on the PhilGEPS. The anticorruption revenue \nprograms will continue to increase the number of tax returns. \n \nc.  Improve Investment Climate and Infrastructure \n \n64.  Subprogram 3 has two investment policy triggers. The first trigger is to promote a \ngovernment-wide approach to regulatory reform where the Government will adopt and begin \nimplementing an action plan for institutionalizing a regulatory review within Government. The \naction plan will include establishment of an oversight agency or unit mandated to advocate \nregulatory impact assessments across government. This will be a long-term effort. The second \ntrigger assesses bottlenecks in distribution of agriculture products from farmer to supermarket \nand/or traditional market, and defines appropriate public sector options for addressing identified \nbottlenecks. This would prepare the foundation for a broader rural investment climate strategy \nand support proposed ADB sector activities in its uplands strategy and watershed projects. \nSupporting milestones include the Philippines ratifies the Kyoto Protocol for Customs, and \nestablishes and operationalizes a single national electronic widow to improve trade facilitation. \n ", "30    \n \nIn infrastructure policy, the medium-term objective is to establish a public\u2013private infrastructure \npartnership  project  preparation  facility.  In  the  interim,  the  Government  will  accomplish  the \nfollowing  milestones:  develop  a  set  of  standard  transaction  documents  for  public\u2013private \npartnerships; issue a set of guidelines to govern joint ventures between government and private \nsector entities; and formulate a strategy for risk assessment and management, particularly for \ninfrastructure projects approved by the Development Budget Coordination Committee. \n \n65.  Impact and Outcomes. By the end of 2009, the DPSP-supported program is expected \nto have improved the Philippine investment climate. The investment to GDP ratio is expected to \nincrease from 14% GDP in 2006 to 16%\u201317% by 2009 and the share of public investment in \nGDP to increase by 1\u20132 percentage points. This progress will be achieved by reducing the \ntransaction costs of doing business (as reflected in reduced number of days to start up a \nbusiness), lowering trade facilitation costs, and increasing private participation in infrastructure.  \n \nd.  Reduce Poverty and Increase Social Inclusion \n \n66.  Subprogram 3 has one social policy trigger. The Government is to expand the CCT to \n321,012  households.  Supporting  milestones  will  be  completion  of  the  CBMS  rollout  and \nproduction  of  a  poverty  monitoring  report  by  NEDA  for  submission  to  senior  government \npolicymakers.  \n \n67.  Impact and Outcomes By the end of 2009, the DPSP will have improved systems for \npoverty monitoring and targeting. The majority of LGUs will have adopted the CBMS; and \nGovernment MDG targets for elementary and high school survival rates, and child immunization \ncoverage will be on track to meet the 2015 targets. The CCT pilots will be complete, and a \nsustainable CCT designed, and implementation under way.  \n \nC.  Financing Plan \n \n68.  The Government has requested a loan of $250,000,000 to finance the Subprogram 2, \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon interbank-offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft program loan agreement presented to the Board. The Government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB. \n \n69.  The ADB funds are to support reforms outlined in the development policy letter and \npolicy matrix (Appendix 2). The loan size was determined by the strength of the policy package, \nits  development  impact,  the  importance  of  the  sectors  covered,  adjustment  costs,  direct \nbudgetary costs, and the development financing needs of the Government, as estimated by \nDOF. Direct adjustment costs include (i) reductions in the revenue of the relevant agencies as a \nresult  of  reductions  in  red  tape  under  the  action  plan  for  institutionalizing  regulatory \nassessments; (ii) costs of carrying out improvements to the PEM systems, including the GFMIS, \nand  establishing  systems  for  disclosing  budget  releases  and  disbursements  on  the  DBM \nwebsite, (iii) costs of implementing the tax administration reform program, and (iv) costs of \ninstitutionalizing the anticorruption programs in revenue-collecting agencies. \n \n ", "  31\n70.  The program loan reflects the development financing needs of the Government (Table 6). \nWhile the DPSP supports the Government\u2019s efforts to balance the national government and \nconsolidated public sector budgets by 2010, the DPSP also recognizes the need for flexibility in \nthe national government budget for 2008. The Government aims to increase development and \nsocial spending in 2008 and, given the need for additional funding to mitigate the effects of the \nslowdown  in  the  US  economy  and  the  surge  in  rice  prices  on  the  poor,  the Government \nenvisages a targeted government deficit of no more than 1% of GDP in 2008 and 0.5% of GDP \nin 2009 with a balanced budget in 2010. According to DOF budget reports, the gross external \nfinancing requirements for 2008 are estimated at $2.8 billion. The Subprogram 2 proposed loan \namount of $250 million will help close the financing gap for 2008.  \n \nTable 6: Projected Government Financing Requirements for 2008 \n \nFinancing Mix 2008    Proposed Amounts in 2008 ($) \n   \n      Programmed gross external borrowings  2.5 billion \n       of which:   \nADB\u2019s proposed loan pipeline   \nDPSP   250.0 million \nLGU finance reform   300.0 million \nGovernance and justice reform  100.0 million \nOther aid and commercial borrowingb  1.85 billion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DPSP = Development Policy Support Program, LGU = local \ngovernment unit,. \nSources: Department of Finance and Asian Development Bank. Exchange rate P46/$1. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n71.  The implementation arrangements established under subprogram 1 will remain under \nsubprogram  2.  DOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  responsible  for  overall  program \nimplementation activities, reporting to ADB, administering and disbursing the Loan proceeds, \nand maintaining accounts. DBM and NEDA shall be the implementing agency responsible for \nimplementing subprogram 2, and shall be supported by the relevant line agencies including \nDepEd, DA, DOH, DPWH, DTI, and OMB. The DPSP coordinating committee initiated under \nsubprogram 1, chaired by the DOF undersecretary and comprising officials from DOF, DBM, \nand NEDA, will be responsible for coordinating implementation and sustaining the DPSP policy \nactions together with DBM and relevant line agencies involved in supporting the DPSP (DepEd, \nDOA, DOH, DPWH, and OMB). The committee will meet quarterly to monitor progress and \noversee program implementation. ADB may be invited to participate in the meetings as an \nobserver. DOF will be responsible for day-to-day program implementation activities, and will \nreport on implementation progress.   \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n72.  The subprogram 2 period is from 1 April 2007 to 30 October 2008. All actions included in \nthe policy matrix were implemented between April 2007 and August 2008. \n \n \n \n \n ", "32    \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n73.  The program loan of $250 million will be released in a single tranche upon satisfactory \ncompletion of all conditions in the subprogram 2 policy matrix (Appendix 2). The loan proceeds \nwill be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  no  more  than  180  days  before  the \neffectiveness date of the loan. Items specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 8) and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are excluded. In accordance with the \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for \nProgram Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as \nthe Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required if during each year that loan \nproceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of Philippines total imports minus imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch year. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required. \nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans. In accordance \nwith the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for program loans, all \ngoods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will be procured, with \ndue consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard \npublic procedures and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. Goods \ncommonly traded on the international commodity market will be procured in accordance with \nprocedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n74.  The  reform  needs  supported  under  the  DPSP  will  be  financed  by  local  currency \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the subprogram 2 loan.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n75.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n76.  A  core  component  of  the  DPSP  cluster  focuses  on  governance  and  reduction  of \ncorruption in key national government agencies vulnerable to such practices. The DPSP cluster \nincludes  reforms  to  PEM  through  the  MTEF,  and  measures  to  improve  transparency  and \naccountability in the budget cycle in agencies with large procurement budgets (e.g., DepEd, \nDOA, DOH, and DPWH). The DPSP supports implementation of the procurement reform law \nand measures to improve transparency in the procurement process (para. 78). The DPSP \nsupports the work of OMB and DOF in reducing corruption in key revenue-collecting agencies of \nBIR and BOC through such anticorruption initiatives as the RATE, RATS, and RIPS programs \n(para. 56). The DPSP cluster supports OMB\u2019s integrity development reviews of key national \ngovernment  agencies  as  a  way  of  identifying  weaknesses  in  national  government  agency \nsystems and procedures that may increase their vulnerability to corruption, and implementing \naction  plans  to  address  these  vulnerabilities.  Subprogram  3  supports  the  Government \n ", "  33\ninstitutionalizing these governance and anticorruption programs within the relevant agencies to \nassure their longer-term sustainability and effectiveness. \n \n77.  The country\u2019s financial management systems were assessed prior to subprogram 1 in \n2007 to better understand fiduciary risks and determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements for \nthe purpose of the DPSP. This assessment was updated for subprogram 2. The update is \nbased on diagnostic work done in the last 12 months including the public expenditure and \nfinancial accountability assessment led by the World Bank, with ADB participation during the \nfirst stage. The assessment identified core areas to be addressed with development partner \nsupport. Discussions with the Government during implementation of the PEM triggers under \nsubprogram 2 and its ongoing PEM reforms were also considered. Based on this assessment, \nthe  fiduciary  arrangements  proposed  for  the  DPSP  remain  acceptable.  The  assessment \nindicates  that  the  Government  has  made  progress  in  improving  systems  related  to  PEM, \nfinancial accountability, and procurement; although weaknesses remain and continued progress \non implementing the Government\u2019s program to improve governance and reduce corruption is \nessential. The Government places significant emphasis on making progress in implementing the \nMTEF in line ministries and the OPIF; improving the credibility of the budget, its execution, and \nreporting; as well as implementing other transparency measures. In this regard, the proposed \nADB policy and advisory TA is designed to support the Government (DBM) to strengthen PEM \ncapacity. \n \n78.  Assessments of the Philippines\u2019 public procurement reforms show substantial progress, \nas mandated by the procurement law and the issuance of implementing rules. The empowered \nGPPB  is  overseeing  implementation  to  make  sure  that  transparency,  efficiency,  and \naccountability principles of the law are carried out. The PhilGEPs system has completed a \nsuccessful first full year of operation making progress in improving transparency. The 2007 \ncountry procurement assessment report (footnote 27) gave the Philippines a high score for its \nlegislative and regulatory framework, but it does less well in procurement operations, monitoring, \nand enforcement. In response, GPPB with input from development partners developed a 3-year \naction plan to ensure full implementation of the law, and address weaknesses identified in the \nreport. A major reform is the establishment of a transparency group. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n79.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at the central bank (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) to receive all loan \nproceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms \nsatisfactory to ADB. DOF will be required to submit quarterly progress reports as well as a final \nreport on the progress of subprogram 2 implementation. \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n \n80.  In cooperation with the DPSP coordinating committee (para. 71) and other development \npartners, ADB will carry out periodic reviews of program implementation, and assess the impact \nof the DPSP. The Government will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with \nother multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for DPSP implementation, and \nprovide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  ADB,  in \ncollaboration with the coordinating committee, will undertake a review of program performance \n8 months after loan effectiveness to review the outcome of subprogram 2 and begin preparation \nof subprogram 3. In addition to the review report, the committee will submit to ADB within 8 \n ", "34    \n \nmonths of loan effectiveness of the subprogram 2, a review report that assesses compliance \nwith, and impact of, the agreed actions under subprogram 2 and subject to the Borrower\u2019s \nreadiness to continue with the DPSP cluster, defines requirements for adjustments to activities \nto be undertaken under the proposed subprogram 3 of the DPSP. In addition, participants in the \nPDF (partner agencies, CSOs, and other stakeholders) will be encouraged to support civil \nsociety monitoring of the DPSP reforms. \n \n81.  The Government and its development partners have agreed on the updated outcome \nand output indicators to monitor DPSP implementation and evaluate its impact, within the \noverall DPSP framework (Appendix 1). \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n82.  In connection with subprogram 2, a policy and advisory technical assistance (PATA) \ngrant is proposed to support capacity development in PEM. The PATA is estimated to cost \n$1,150,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide $800,000, to be financed by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $350,000  equivalent  by  providing \ncounterpart  staff  and  other  facilities.  A  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  will \nimplement the PATA activities. ADB will engage a consulting firm or individuals, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A total of 50 (19 international and 31 national) \nperson-months  of  consulting  will  be  required.  The  PATA  purpose,  outputs,  methodology, \nimplementation arrangements, and budget are in Appendix 9, and the terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n83.  The key benefits expected from the DPSP are as follows: \n \n(i)  Progress toward medium-term fiscal sustainability will promote macroeconomic \nstability  and  foster  broad-based  economic  growth,  job  creation,  and  poverty \nreduction, all of which are cornerstones of the Government\u2019s MTPDP and PDF. \n(ii)  An increase in tax revenues as a percentage of GDP will provide additional \nresources for spending on the social sectors and therefore have a direct positive \nimpact on the poor. \n(iii)  Better governance in PEM will improve prioritization and efficiency of spending in \nkey sectors such as the social sector. \n(iv)  Lower transaction costs for business, because of the reduction in bureaucracy \nwill  open  new  opportunities,  increase  investment  and  productivity,  boost  the \neconomy, increase incomes, and create jobs. \n(v)  Higher  infrastructure  spending  will  generate  long-term  growth,  stimulate \ninvestment, create jobs, and raise incomes. \n(vi)  Improved  social  sector  outcomes  will  result  from  increased  spending,  better \ntargeted social assistance programs, and implementation of the CCT program \nlinked to better outcomes for child education and health.  \n(vii)  Sustainability  of  key  governance  programs  will  be  facilitated,  as  the  DPSP \nsupports the institutionalization of governance programs including the MTEF and \nintegrity development reviews. DOF\u2019s anticorruption revenue initiatives in BIR \nand BOC will help support the sustainability of these initiatives. \n ", "  35\nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n84.  The DPSP is subject to the following risks. \n \n(i)  A sharp slowdown in the US economy and turbulence in its capital markets affect \ngrowth conditions in the Philippines economy and negatively impact fiscal policy. \nThe surge in food price inflation persists in 2008, slowing household consumption \nand economic growth, and threatening to increase poverty. ADB staff estimates \nsuggest that food price increases of 30% could increase poor families\u2019 spending \non rice by up to P50 billion, including 7% of the population that are vulnerable to \nfalling into poverty. However, these effects may be mitigated by the continued \nresilience of remittances, which are up by 14.5% in dollar terms (20% in peso \nterms) in the first 4 months of 2008 over the same period in 2007. The DPSP \nprovides fiscal flexibility by providing for the national government budget deficit of \nup to 1% of GDP in 2008. \n(ii)  With the economic stresses in 2008 and an election in 2010, the Government \nmay be tempted to introduce populist policies that could threaten fiscal discipline \nin 2008 and 2009, and economic efficiency. \n(iii)  The 2010 presidential elections may slow implementation of reforms. However, \nthe  Government  has  full  ownership  of  the  DPSP  reform  program,  which  is \nembedded  in  the  Philippines  development  forum  and  its  sector  strategies. \nMoreover the first DPSP generation of reforms is expected to be completed \nbefore the next elections. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n85.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the development needs as outlined \nunder the DPSP implementation arrangements. \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the date of subprogram 2 of the DPSP \nloan agreement, as described in the development policy letter (including the \npolicy matrix), will continue to be in effect for the duration of subprogram 2 and \nsubsequently. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n86.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$250,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for the Development Policy Support Program, \nSubprogram  2  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Program Loan Agreement presented \nto the Board. \n \n    Haruhiko Kuroda \n    President \n \n8 September 2008 \n ", "36  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n      Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  Performance Targets  Update to  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Subprogram 2  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact   By 2010, revised    National Statistics  Assumption \n  MTPDP goals attained:    Office (NSO) data  \u2022  Macroeconomic and \n      and National  political stability \n(i)  Sustainable  (i)   Real gross  (i)   Economic  Statistics   \nhigher economic  domestic product  growth 7.2% in  Coordination Board  Risks \ngrowth  (GDP) growth at  2007  (NSCB)  \u2022  Lack of effective \n  6%\u20137%    [early    coordination among \n    achievement]    national government \n        departments \n(ii)  Reduced  (ii)  Unemployment  (ii)  Unemployment  Annual national labor  \u2022  A sharp slowdown in \nunemployment  reduced from 8% in  reduced from  force surveys from  the United States \n2005 to 6.5% in  7.9% in 2006  NSO  economy and \n2010a        to 7.3% in    turbulence in its \n2007    capital markets \n  [on track]    transmit to the \nPhilippine economy. \nSurge in food price \ninflation persists in \n2008, slowing \nconsumption and \neconomic growth, \nand increasing \nunemployment and \npoverty.  \nOutcome  By 2009:  (i)   Standard &  Three major  Assumption \nImproved investor  (i)   Upgrade in  Poor\u2019s  international credit- \u2022  Economy able to \nconfidence  sovereign credit  upgraded  rating agencies  withstand external oil \nrating (BB-negative  outlook from  monitoring on the  and food price \noutlook or  \u201cstable\u201d in  Philippines  shocks in 2008 \nequivalent in 2005)  2007 to     \n  \u201cpositive\u201d in     \n  2008    Risk \n    [early    Political and regulatory \n  achievement]    uncertainties may \n      continue to prevail \n(ii)   Increase in share of  (ii)   Fixed capital  NSCB  \nfixed capital to  formation   \nGDP in the range  increased by \nof 2 to 4  0.8 percentage \npercentage points  points in 2007 \n(14% in 2006)  from 2006. \n    [on track] \n   \n \nOutputs  By end-2009 (with      Assumption \n  baseline 2004/05      \u2022  Government stays \n1.

The sector analysis provides a summary assessment of recent economic performance.1 \nIt concludes that the Philippine economy has shifted to a higher growth path based on improved \neconomic fundamentals. Better economic management has contributed to this turnaround in the \neconomy. However, much needs to be done to increase the investment rate to sustain higher \neconomic growth above 6 % per annum over the medium term. \n \nA.  Background \n \n2.  Long-Term Economic Performance. Available data and discussions with stakeholders \nindicate that the long-term performance of the economy is improving. The current economic \nexpansion is the longest in three decades, with economic growth above 4% per annum since \n2000 or averaging 5.1% per year, compared with an average annual growth rate of 2% in the \n1990s. Asian Development Bank (ADB) staff estimates indicate that the Philippines\u2019 potential or \nlong-term economic growth rate is increasing in line with structural change in the economy and \nis estimated at about 6% (Figure A4.1). In terms of per capita income, growth has averaged \n2.2% per annum since 2003, compared with an average annual rate of 0.3% per annum in the \n1990s and a negative 0.8% rate in the 1980s. While per capita income growth since 2003 is at it \nhighest rate in three decades, it remains below the regional average of 3.6%, primarily because \nof a much higher population growth rate than in neighboring countries. Higher and sustained per \ncapita income growth is necessary to reduce poverty. \n \nFigure A4.1: Philippines Growth Performance \na. Business Cycle and Potential Economic Growth    b.

Economic growth since 2000 has closely followed \npotential  economic  growth  suggesting  the  expansion  is  based  on  improved  economic \nfundamentals. In particular, economic growth in the past 3 years is associated with historically \nlow  inflation  supported  by  a  well-governed,  independent  central  bank;  greater  fiscal \nconsolidation; declining public debt as a share of GDP back to levels of the early 1990s; the \nlongest  ever  running  current  account  surplus;  and  higher  total  factor  productivity  growth  \n(para. 5). In contrast, previous expansions were associated with sharp fluctuations in growth \naround long-term trends and substantial macroeconomic imbalances including high inflation, \nincreasing public debt, and at times deterioration in the balance of payments\u2014all features of a \nboom\u2013bust business cycle not based on economic fundamentals. Political instability also helped \nshorten economic expansions in the 1980s and 1990s. \n \n4.  Improved  Economic  Management.  This  has  contributed  to  better  economic \nfundamentals in the last decade. Selected examples of improved economic governance include \nthe major trade policy reforms undertaken since the early 1990s, improved competition policy in \nkey areas of telecommunications, air transportation, financial sector, and most recently the \npower subsector and tax reforms. After years of endemic corruption and mismanaged monetary \npolicy, the central bank was reformed under new legislation in 1993 to become among the best \ngoverned and credible central banks in the region. With greater autonomy, professionalization of \nstaff, and development of appropriate monetary tools including inflation targeting adopted in \n2000,  the  central  bank  has  successfully  lowered  inflation  to  well  under  10%  per  annum  \n(Figure A4.2). The country\u2019s macroeconomic management has improved when benchmarked \nagainst  neighboring  economies  such  as  Indonesia,  with  inflation  and  national  government \ndeficits below regional averages in recent years (Table A4).  \n \nTable A4: Philippine and Indonesia, GDP Growth and Government Financials \n(as % of GDP, unless otherwise stated) \n \n       Budget          Inflation \n    GDP  Surplus/    Tax  Interest    (% \nCountry  Year  Growth  (Deficit)   Revenue  Revenue  Costs  Debt  average. \nfor year) \nIndonesia  2006  5.5  (1.0)  19.0  11.0  2.4  39.0  13.1 \n  2007  6.3  (1.2)  17.8  11.3  2.0  35.0  6.4 \nPhilippines  2006  5.4  (0.9)  16.2  14.3  5.1  64.0  6.2 \n  2007  7.2         (0.2)a         17.1a  14.0  4.0  59.0  2.6 \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \na Includes proceeds from privatization of state commercial assets. \nSources: Department of Finance, Republic of Philippines; and Department of Finance, Republic of Indonesia. \n \n5.  Total Factor Productivity. In contrast to previous growth spurts, total factor productivity \n(a  measure  of  improved  economic  efficiency)  as  a  driver  of  economic  growth,  increased \nsignificantly over the last decade (Figure A4.3). From 2000 to 2006, total factor productivity \ngrowth averaged 2.4% per annum, compared with an average zero growth in the 1990s and \nnegative productivity growth in the 1980s. The growth occurred across major economic sectors \nand  especially  surged  in  the  services  sector  associated  with  growth  in  high  value-added \ninformation technology services. Microeconomic reforms in the 1990s and 2000s contributed, as \nthe economy adjusted to trade reforms (i.e., lower import protection), competition reforms in \nmajor sectors noted earlier, and financial sector reforms. Measures of import protection show \n ", "Appendix 4  57\nthat  the  Philippine  economy  is  now  relatively  open  with  low  protection  in  manufacturing, \nalthough  pockets  of  high  protection  persist  in  agriculture  (rice,  corn,  coffee,  pork),  food \nprocessing (processed meats), and furniture production. \n \n6.  Remittances. Remittances hit record levels estimated at $14.4 billion sent through the \nbanking system in 2007 up from less than $5 billion in 2000. Remittances have kept the current \naccount in surplus at 5% of GDP, boosted household consumption, and contributed to reducing \nhousehold debt. Remittances have also reduced the national poverty rate by 5 percentage \npoints (Supplementary Appendix B).  \n \n7.  Investment. Investment grew by 11.5% in real terms in 2007, up from 1.4% in 2006. \nThe upturn was driven by increased public infrastructure spending, up by 29.5% in 2007. Private \nsector investment also grew strongly with private construction increasing at 15.9% compared \nwith negative 1.4% in 2006. Overall, the investment to GDP ratio improved from 14.0% in 2006 \nto 14.6% in 2007. The investment to GDP ratio is low compared to its precrisis average of 23%. \n \n8.  Challenges  to  Sustaining  Economic  Growth.  In  the  short  term,  the  Philippine \neconomy is vulnerable to the sharp slowdown in the United States economy and turbulence in \nits  capital  markets;  the  recent  surge  in  international  food  prices  is  slowing  household \nconsumption. Over the medium term, however, the critical challenge facing the Philippines is to \nsustain a higher investment growth rate.  \n \nB.  Medium-Term Investment Issues \n \n9.  Investment needs to grow by at least 10% per annum to sustain economic growth above \n6%. ADB staff estimates suggest that the Philippines is underinvesting in physical capital by as \nmuch  as  5  percentage  points  of  GDP  compared  with  its  long-run  equilibrium  rate.  The \nGovernment has increased public spending on infrastructure and this has lifted the investment \nrate; it will need to continue this and to implement measures in a number of areas to increase \nprivate investment. In an ADB survey on investment incentives, investors rated macroeconomic \nstability, political stability, skilled labor, incentives, openness, bureaucracy, legal system, and \nlaw and order as their most important investment decision factors. Therefore cross-cutting \nmeasures  to  improve  the  investment  climate  include  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability; \nlowering regulatory costs; improving trade facilitation; promoting rural development including \nconnectivity with urban markets; and establishing a transparent framework for infrastructure \ndevelopment, including improving the resource efficiency of public infrastructure spending as a \ncorollary to fiscal consolidation efforts. \n ", "58  Appendix 4 \n                                                                                                     \nFigure A4.2: Economic Management and Fundamentals of the Philippines Economy \n \na.

The Government has outlined a strategy to increase the investment rate over the next \nfew years supported by the Development Policy Support Program:  \n \n(i)  Continue to promote reduction in national and LGU bureaucracy and implement \nprocesses  to  improve  the  quality  of  regulation  making  by  institutionalizing  a \nregulatory  review  process.  The  Government  has  produced  a  handbook  on \nbusiness regulatory reform and best LGU practices, and disseminated it to LGUs. \nThe  National  Economic  Development  Authority  is  mandated  to  review  all \nproposed adjustments in user charges and surcharges by line ministries. It will \nadopt  and  implement  an  action  plan  to  institutionalize  a  regulatory  review \nassessment across government as a more systematic way to address regulatory \nreforms. \n(ii)  The Government recognizes that it needs to continue to lower trade facilitation \ncosts in terms of time required to get goods to and from the Philippines, its cost, \ntransparency in trade facilitation, and timely collection of trade data and customs \nrevenues.  It  is  implementing  the  national  single  window,  which  will  allow \n ", "60  Appendix 4 \nimporters to electronically track shipments through customs. The Department of \nAgriculture has consolidated five certification agencies into one, and will integrate \nthis with the national single window. The Government has signed on to the Kyoto \ncustoms protocol and will submit this to Congress for ratification in 2008. \n(iii)  With assistance of ADB and other development partners, the Government will \ncontinue investments in irrigation and clean water, and road infrastructure to \nimprove  rural\u2013urban  connectivity.  The  Government  with  ADB  assistance  will \ndevelop strategies for uplands investment and development, and to address \nbottlenecks in connectivity between farmers and urban retailers. \n(iv)  The Government continues its public spending infrastructure program and the \n2008 budget has earmarked 12% increases in 2008. Over the medium term, the \nGovernment\u2019s  objective  is  to  establish  a  public\u2013private  partnership  project \npreparation facility to improve the quality of project preparation. In the interim, the \nGovernment  will  take  steps  to  establish  a  project  preparation  facility.  It  will \ndevelop a policy framework for risk management and guarantees for public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships  in  infrastructure  projects  approved  by  Development  and \nBudget  Coordination  Committee  and  develop  a  set  of  standard  transaction \ndocuments for public\u2013private partnerships. The National Economic Development \nAuthority will initiate the development and rollout of the web-based monitoring \nsystem to track progress in implementation of all foreign-assisted projects.  \n \n \nFigure A4.4: Investment Decision Factorsa \n \nImportance to investment decision Philippines rating\n10\nx\n0)   \n1 8\nm \nu\nm\nxi 6\na\nm\ne (\nor 4\nc\ns\ne \ng\na 2\ner\nv\nA\n0\nMacroeconomic Political Export markets Local market Openness  Incentives Local laws, red Transparency Legal system Law and order Cheap labour Skilled labour Access to mat.

The  immediate  pressing  issues  for  macroeconomic  policy  are  the  acceleration  of \ndomestic price inflation and its impact on growth conditions in the Philippines, the 2008 fiscal \npolicy, and the poor. While much has been done to put fiscal policy on a sound path, critical \nissues for the Government over the medium term include sustaining priority spending through \nefforts to raise revenues, improve efficiency of public expenditure management, and increase \neffectiveness of debt management. The Government has outlined a fiscal sustainability strategy \nsupported by the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP). \n \nA.   Inflation \n \n2.  From an average of 2.8 % in 2007, consumer price inflation accelerated to 9.6% in May \n2008 year-on-year, well above the upper limit of the central bank\u2019s inflation target of 3%\u20135% for \n2008.  Core  inflation  (which  excludes  volatile  food  and  energy  prices)  reached  6.2%  in  \nMay 2008, from an average of 2.8% in 2007. The rise in food prices\u201413.7% in May year-on-\nyear\u2014accounted for 70% of inflation in the first 5 months of 2008 (Figure A5.1a). Available data \nsuggest that much of the recent surge in inflation can be attributed to the sharp increase in \ninternational food prices, in particular prices of grains (Figure A5.2b). The appreciation of the \npeso to dollar exchange rate moderated the impact of imported food inflation on the domestic \neconomy in 2007. However, with increased risks of the peso depreciating this year (as real \ninterest rates are currently negative), the exchange rate will not be able to contain imported \ninflation. If international food price inflation persists, further domestic inflation is expected in the \ncoming months. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) staff forecasts for inflation suggest the \npossibility of double-digit food price inflation during the second quarter of 2008. Food price \ninflation is estimated to raise food expenditures of the poor by P50 billion in 2008, including an \nadditional 7% of the population that are vulnerable to falling into poverty as a consequence \n(Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n \nFigure A5.1: Inflation in the Philippines \n   \n      a.

Lack  of  Fiscal  Discipline.  The  national  Government  has  posted  only  four  budget \nsurpluses in 37 years; three were in the 1990s. Fiscal indiscipline coupled with poor monetary \npolicy management (until 1993 when the central bank was reformed) were the main contributors \nto macro instability from the late 1970s to 2004 (Figure A4.2). In 2005, the Philippines emerged \nfrom  another  serious  fiscal  situation  (from  1998  to  2004)  when  budget  revenues  dropped \nsignificantly leading to suppressed expenditure in the social sectors and substantial decline in \npublic sector real wages.1 The deficit reached 5.2% of GDP and the nonfinance public sector \ndebt exceeded 100% of GDP in the same year. The Government has restored macroeconomic \nstability and maintained it through fiscal discipline. The cornerstone and the measure with the \nhighest revenue impact was the reform of value-added tax in November 2005, which extended \nthe value-added tax base to energy products, and increased the rate from 10% to 12% effective \nFebruary 2006. Other measures supporting fiscal consolidation include increasing (i) excise \ntaxes on alcohol and tobacco products by 30% at the end of 2004 (although not fully indexed to \ninflation), (ii) the corporate income tax rate from 32% to 35%, and (iii) electricity tariffs. As a \nconsequence of these reforms, tax revenues grew by over 1.3 percentage points of GDP in \n2006,  the  national  government  deficit  fell  to  1.1%  of  GDP  from  2.7%  in  2005,  and  the \nconsolidated public sector budget (which includes the balances of the government-owned and  \n-controlled corporations) turned in a surplus for the first time in almost a decade, aided by the \nfinancial improvement of the National Power Corporation. Fiscal consolidation continued in 2007 \nwith the national government deficit falling to 0.2% of GDP and the consolidated public sector \ndeficit remaining in balance for a second consecutive year. Tax revenues in 2007 grew by 8%, \nshort  of  the  budget  target  of  14.8%.  Nevertheless,  total  revenues  grew  by  14%  aided  by \nproceeds from privatization of state-owned assets, demonstrating the Government\u2019s resolve in \nmaintaining fiscal discipline. \n \n4.  The reduction in the national government deficit by 2.3 percentage points in 2005 over \n2003 was entirely due to expenditure suppression (Table A5.1). In 2006, revenues played a \nlarger role in deficit reduction, accounting for 85% of the deficit reduction of 1.6 percentage \npoints over 2005. In 2007, revenues accounted for the entire reduction in the deficit from 1.1% \nof GDP in 2006 to 0.2% in 2007. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  For  a  detailed  discussion  on  the  fiscal  problem  and  consolidation  strategy  see  ADB.  2007.

Considerable fiscal gains have been achieved since 2005, and fiscal space has been \nprovided from increased tax revenues since then. Building on these is an important medium-\nterm goal. The Government is committed to a balanced budget by 2010. In the context of a \nmedium-term  balanced  budget  framework,  the  three  major  medium-term  issues  are  \n(i) sustaining priority spending through efforts to increase revenues, (ii) improving efficiency of \npublic expenditure management, and (iii) increasing effectiveness of debt management. \n \n6.  The Government\u2019s goal is to raise national government noninterest expenditures by an \nadditional 1 percentage point of GDP over the next 3 years. This includes raising capital outlays \nby 1.2 percentage points to reach its target of 3.2% of GDP by 2010. To achieve these goals, \nthe Government targets an increase in tax revenues of 1.6 percentage points. The tax revenue \ntarget is achievable but requires increased efforts. Revenue management is challenged by  \n(i) the proliferation of tax incentives in growth sectors of the economy that may have resulted in \nas much as P47 billion in foregone revenues; (ii) generous income tax deductions that have \neroded the tax base; (iii) poorly structured excise tax regime; and (iv) weak tax administration \nincluding over half of regional tax offices using a manual operating system resulting in a backlog \nin processing of tens of thousands of income tax files and new tax registrations, weak systems \nfor monitoring tax credits, management of tax arrears, and tax audits. The Government is \nsystematically addressing these issues. The Bureau of Internal Revenue has a comprehensive \ntax administration reform program up to 2010 with support from the World Bank, Swedish \nInternational Development Agency (SIDA), and ADB (in 2008), but implementation has been \nslower than expected. This is partly due to the complexity of the reform program and its \noutreach to all 79 revenue district offices (RDOs), but also because BIR is resource constrained \nas  reflected  in  the  decline  in  budget  operating  costs  per  employee  \n(Figure A5.2e). Over the longer term, the Government will need to address budget resource \nallocations to BIR as it implements its tax reforms. \n ", "64  Appendix 5 \n \nFigure A5.2: Fiscal Policy Performance \n \n  a.

Medium-Term Outlook. The medium-term outlook for fiscal policy (Table A5) presents \nthe Government\u2019s baseline scenario based on assumptions about improvements in revenue \ncollections, economic growth ranging from 5% to 7% per annum from 2008 to 2010, relatively \nlow inflation around 5% after 2008, and continuing tax administration reforms supported by the \nDPSP. The fiscal deficit is projected to be less than 1% in 2008, 0.5% in 2009, and balanced in \n2010, consistent with the need to ensure debt sustainability. The fiscal consolidation is primarily \ndriven  by  an  improved  revenue  effort,  with  tax  revenues  projecting  to  rise  by  about  \n1.6 percentage points of GDP over the next 3 years. Primary expenditures would rise by  \n1.6 percentage points and capital outlays by 1.2 percentage points. The national government \nand  nonfinancial  public  sector  debt  would  continue  to  fall  below  50%  of  GDP  ensuring \nsustainable debt and providing a buffer in the event of future shocks to the economy. While the \nscenario is indicative, it does demonstrate the need to continue increasing revenue effort. \n \n8.  Medium-term  sustainable  priority  spending  requires  improving  efficiency  in  public \nexpenditure  management  by  ensuring  a  balanced  public  expenditure  program  for  capital \nspending and recurrent expenditures, as well as for discretionary and nondiscretionary spending \nitems (interest payments and wages). This will require continuing to reorient spending to priority \nsectors  of education, health,  and  public  infrastructure.  Implementing  improved  systems  for \npublic  expenditure  management  including  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework,  which \naligns  the  budget  planning  process  with  strategic  objectives  and  priorities,  is  integral  to \nimproving  efficiency  in  public  expenditure  management.  Progress  is  being  made.  The \nDepartment of Budget and Management has incorporated the medium-term framework into the \n2008 budget including forward estimates for a 3-year rolling period produced for all 23 national \nagencies. It is now in the process of computerizing the computation of forward estimates and \nwill roll it out to priority line ministries. Recent diagnostic assessments carried out by the \nInternational Monetary Fund, World Bank, and ADB under the DPSP identify several core areas \nto be addressed with aid support beginning with budget preparation through to budget execution \nincluding  scope  to  improve  cash  management,  establish  internal  controls  and  audit,  and \nstrengthen budget reporting processes. Integral to this will be the development of an integrated \ngovernment financial management system. The ADB-supported Health Sector Development \nProgram offers one example of how systematic provincial public expenditure reviews and the \nuse of programmatic initiatives can help effect change.  \n \n9.  Debt Sustainability. Public debt as a share of GDP has declined to levels of the early \n1990s, but remains high by regional standards (Table A5 and Figure A5.2b). At the end of 2007, \nnational  financial  sector  public  debt,  which  includes  the  debt  of  government-owned  and  \n-controlled corporations, is estimated at $118 billion or 69% of GDP, down from its peak of \n101% in 2003. National government debt accounts for the bulk of the national financial sector \npublic debt and is estimated at $89 billion or 59% of GDP in 2007, down from 64% in 2006. A \nprudent  borrowing  strategy,  economic  growth,  and  appreciation  of  the  peso  to  the  dollar \ncontributed to the rapid decline. Debt servicing costs as a share of national government budget \nexpenditures also declined from 29% in 2006 to 23% in 2007, thereby freeing up P36 billion for \npriority spending in 2007. However, at 4% of GDP, the Philippines\u2019 public debt servicing costs \nare high by regional standards and about double that of Indonesia (Table A4). Overall debt \nservice  burden  remains  manageable.  However,  external  debt  (accounting  for  40%  of  total \nnational government debt) is vulnerable to increased risks of depreciation in the peso to dollar \nexchange rate in 2008. Domestic debt servicing costs are vulnerable to rising interest rates on \nGovernment securities in 2008: the average interest rate on new issues of 364 day Treasury \nbills increased from 5.2% in January 2008 to 6% by March 2008. As of the first 5 months of \n2008, interest payments on national government debt were P133 billion, well within the 2008 \nbudget target of P146 billion for the same period. \n ", "66  Appendix 5 \n \n10.  The Government has outlined a strategy to support a sustainable adjustment in fiscal \npolicy  over  the  next  few  years  and  measures  to  improve  public  expenditure  management \nsupported by the DPSP. Activities include the following:  \n(i)  Continue to implement tax policy reforms to enhance the revenue system by \nbroadening the tax base and rationalizing income tax incentives. A revised tax \nincentives rationalization bill was submitted to Congress at the end of 2007; \nCongress is expected to pass the bill in 2008. Its revenue effects will not begin to \nbe  realized  until  2009.  Other  measures  include  reforming  the  structure  and \nadministration of the excise tax on cigarettes, and raising the rates in 2009. \n(ii)  Strengthen tax administration, including by completing the update of taxpayer \nregistration; and improving registration processes, audit strategies, management \nof arrears, and tracking and monitoring of tax credits. \n(iii)  Increase spending on the social sectors and public infrastructure in the 2007 and \n2008 budgets. \n(iv)  Pilot  performance  contracts  in  large  government-owned  and  -controlled \ncorporations to identify monitorable targets. \n(v)  Strengthen debt management systems to bring them in line with international \nbest practice. \n(vi)  Continue to implement a rolling 3-year, medium-term expenditure framework and \ncomputation of forward estimates. \n(vii)  Program for strengthening budget execution including initiating development of \nthe  government  financial  management  information  system  with  technical \nassistance from ADB, among others.  \n ", "  Appendix 6  67 \n         \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title:  Philippines/Development Policy Support Program, Subprogram 2 \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Southeast Asia Department/ \nPolicy-based program loan \nModality:  Division:  Governance, Finance, and Trade Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Philippines: The DPSP policy areas largely correspond with \nthose of the Government as spelled out in the Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan (MTPDP) 2004\u20132010, which \nfocuses on five core areas: (i) economic growth and job creation; (ii) energy dependency and power sector reforms; (iii) social \njustice and basic needs; (iv) education and youth opportunities; and (v) anticorruption measures and governance. The \nMTPDP mission is to \u201cfight poverty by building prosperity for the greatest number of Filipino people.\u201d  \n \nThe Government has made substantial progress in addressing fiscal consolidation and is now shifting to ensuring sustainable \nfiscal policy by enhancing tax revenues over the longer term. This is necessary to increase social expenditures. In 2008 the \nGovernment will operate a budget deficit of no more than 1% of GDP, 0.5% of GDP in 2009, and balanced budget by 2010. \nThis ensures fiscal discipline while at the same time provides flexibility on fiscal policy to protect social spending, such as \nduring the recent episode of food price inflation. The value-added tax reform is producing results, as well as the intensified \ncollection performance by the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs in the first semester of 2008. The \nincreased revenue from reforms in 2006 was used to reduce public debt, and to finance infrastructure and social services in \n2007 and maintain this level of spending in 2008.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe sustained economic expansion is beginning to impact the Philippines' stubbornly high unemployment rate for the first time \nin a decade. Lower long-term economic growth coupled with relatively restrictive labor regulations meant higher longer-term \nunemployment in the Philippines compared with its regional neighbors. In 2007, the unemployment rate fell to an average of \n7.3% from 7.9% in 2006, although the economic slowdown in 2008 has raised the average unemployment rate. Progress on \npoverty reduction and income inequality has been less clear. The 2006 family income and expenditure survey indicates the \nheadcount poverty rate increased by 3 percentage points from 30% in 2003 to 33% in 2006. \n \n2. Design Features. With support through the DPSP, the Government is addressing these issues of poverty and vulnerability \nto poverty by reforming social protection programs, introducing the conditional cash transfer program, and increasing \nspending on the social sectors. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nThe DPSP supports the Government to address these issues through the program\u2019s social sector component. The DPSP \nsupports increased spending on the social sector in areas where the Philippines is lagging in its Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) (e.g., education). It also supports the design and implementation of the conditional cash transfer program that \nlinks assistance with outcomes in family education and health. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nADB staff assessments suggest that much of the increase in poverty can be attributed to energy cost increases in 2006 rather \nthan structural changes to household incomes and distribution as the Gini coefficient did not changed significantly. Hence, the \nspike may be temporary and not a reversal of recent trends. However, a new spike in poverty us expected in 2008 due to the \nsurge in food prices. Mitigating these effects for households is the fact that remittances to the Philippines accelerated in the \nfirst 5 months of 2008. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "68  Appendix 6 \nB.

Trigger dropped from Program. \n0.5% of GDP in 2007  Tax revenues up by 9% in 2007 resulting in a drop in the tax \nto GDP ratio from 14.3% in 2006 to 14% in 2007. The \nshortfall occurred in the first semester of 2007, with tax \nrevenue collection up 5.1% for the same period in 2006. \nRemedial actions were undertaken in mid-2007 contributing \nto a recovery in tax revenue collection: tax revenues grew \nbetween 13% and 15% in the second semester of 2007 and \n13.8% in the first semester of 2008. Overall, for the 12 \nmonths ending June 2008, tax revenues grew 14% on a \nyear-on-year  basis.  With  nominal  GDP  growth  estimated \nbetween 10.4% for the 12 months ending June 2008 (and \n11.6% in the first semester of 2008), the tax to GDP ratio \nincreased  about  0.3  percentage  points.  Factors  that \ncontributed  to  the  shortfall  in  tax  revenues  in  the  first \nsemester include macroeconomic factors (peso exchange \nrate  appreciation,  slower  growth  in  imports),  tax  policy \nchanges (removal of the cap on value-added tax credits), \ntax  administration  and  enforcement  weaknesses  (front \nloading of excise tax payments at the end of 2006, and a \nsurge in fuel smuggling out of the Subic special economic \nzone). Weak tax administration and inefficiencies in the tax \npolicy indicate that BIR and BOC were unable to increase \ntax revenues through improvements in tax efficiency and \nenforcement.  Remedial  action  undertaken  in  mid-2007 \nincluded  removal  of  senior  BIR  personnel,  including  the \ncommissioner, and increased use of legislative instruments \n(tax amnesties and abatements) to encourage payment of \ntax arrears and increase inspections. Technically, the trigger \nwas not accomplished in 2007; however, progress since \nAugust 2007 indicates the Government\u2019s commitment to tax \nrevenue enhancement and therefore partial accomplishment \nof the trigger. With hindsight, the formulation of the trigger \nwas inappropriate. The trigger is a revenue forecast and \ntherefore  subject  to  change  based  on  changes  in  the \nunderlying  macroeconomic  assumptions  (nominal  GDP \ngrowth, inflation, peso exchange rate), which also changed \nduring 2007. The tax trigger was dropped to align with the \napproach the Asian Development Bank (ADB) used in the \nIndonesian  DPSP,  which  avoids  numerical  targets  and \nforecasts for key macroeconomic policy triggers including \nrevenue  collection,  and  instead  monitors  performance \nthrough the DMF. \n ", "70  Appendix 7 \nOriginal Triggers as Specified in   \nSubprogram 1 Document, Table A2.2 of  Performance \nAppendix 2 \n4.

Three  other \ndepartments (DepEd, DOA, DPWH), designated to submit \nbudget  proposals  on  the  new  budget  structure  under \nsubprogram  2,  were  unable  to  do  so  as  DBM  had  not \napproved  their  rationalization  plans.

To support implementation of the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP), the \nGovernment of the Philippines asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide policy and \nadvisory  technical  assistance  (PATA).  The  core  objective  of  the  PATA  is  to  support  the \nGovernment (Department of Budget and Management [DBM]) to implement and monitor key \npublic expenditure management (PEM) reforms with a focus on enhancing budget execution, \naccounting,  recording,  and  reporting.  The  PATA  requires  analytical  inputs  and  institutional \ncapacity building to DBM and selected line ministries with the rollout of PEM reforms. The scope \nof the PATA parallels the DPSP, covering the governance and PEM component, and impact \nand outcomes listed in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \n1.  Issues \n \n2.  Medium-term sustainable priority spending requires improving the efficiency of PEM. \nKey challenges for the Government are to balance the public expenditure program between \ncapital  spending  and  recurrent  expenditures,  as  well  as  between  discretionary  and \nnondiscretionary spending items (local government unit [LGU] transfers, wages, and interest \npayments);  and  to  implement  improved  PEM  systems.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  other \ndevelopment partners identified several PEM issues from budget preparation through to budget \nexecution, cash management and forecasting, accounting, recording and reporting, internal \ncontrol, and audit that will require a much longer term and coordinated effort in capacity building. \nIntegral  to  improved  budget  execution  is  developing  a  whole  of  government  approach  to \nfinancial management information systems building on existing, fragmented systems such as \nthe electronic national accounting system (eNGAS) and PhilGEPs. \n \n3.  The PATA supports a core element of the Government\u2019s PEM reform agenda. Under the \nDPSP cluster the Government is committed to rolling out the MTEF, initiating development of \nthe GFMIS, piloting and then rolling out internal control and audit to national line agencies, and \nenhancing budget transparency and reporting. The PATA complements another ADB technical \nassistance (TA) on enhancing tax revenue collection including providing assistance to upgrade \nrevenue-forecasting capabilities at the Department of Finance. It complements activities of other \ndevelopment  partners,  including  the  World  Bank  and  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment. The World Bank has a small grant providing support to DBM\u2019s budget strategy \npaper and Australian Agency for International Development is assisting with computation of \nforward estimates under the MTEF. ADB has worked closely with development partners in \npreparing the PATA, and will continue to do so during implementation to ensure efficient use of \nresources.   \n \n2.  The Technical Assistance \na.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The PATA will support the DPSP cluster by (i) enhancing budget execution, accounting, \nrecording, and reporting; and (ii) initiating the development of an integrated GFMIS, which is a \npolicy trigger for the DPSP subprogram 3. \n \n ", "74   Appendix 9 \n5.  Impacts of the PATA are an enhanced PEM system with improved budget transparency \nand  efficiency.  Over  the  longer  term,  these  reforms  will  improve  sustainability  of  priority \nspending.    \n \nb.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The key PATA activities are divided into three components: \n \n7.  Implement Public Expenditure Management Reforms. This component will support \nDBM with its budget execution reforms. Activities include assistance with streamlining budget \nexecution procedures and information systems; conducting diagnostic assessments of spending \nbehavior of line ministries; strengthening payroll and allowance internal control and monitoring \nprocedures, including for special purpose funds; and implementing the rollout of DBM\u2019s internal \ncontrol  and  audit  in  selected  pilot  ministries.  This  component  will  help  DBM  implement \nbudgetary  reforms  in  government  owned  and  controlled  corporations  (GOCCs),  including \nbudget process, internal controls, organizational structure, and assessment of subsidies and net \nlending to GOCCs. The component will provide staff capacity training in improving budget \nexecution.  \n \n8.  Develop a GFMIS. This component will build on the results of diagnostic work on a \nGFMIS that will be undertaken by DBM in 2008 including implementing the road map for \ndeveloping an integrated GFMIS within the national government. This component will support \nDBM to initiate the development of the GFMIS building on existing information systems such as \nthe electronic national accounting system (eNGAS), e-budget, and PhilGEPS, and will be the \nbuilding blocks for subsequent TA. It will start with aligning the chart of accounts between DBM \nand COA. This component will help DBM establish an interagency working group to oversee \nGFMIS reforms across government.  \n \n9.  Implement Change Management. This component will develop and implement change \nmanagement strategies to support the DBM budget reform program and its reform unit, and \nprepare a strategy for rollout to selected line ministries. Technical assistance will be provided to \nselected line ministries to strengthen capacity to provide timely posting of budget data on the \nDBM website.  \n \n  3.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The PATA is estimated to cost $1,150,000 equivalent. ADB will provide a $800,000 grant \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will provide the remaining $350,000 \nequivalent by providing counterpart staff and facilities (Table A9). \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  DBM will be the executing agency, as it is responsible for national budget execution. It \nwill chair the interministerial working group on PEM; provide office space, counterpart staff, and \nother services to the consultants; and closely coordinate with line ministries and agencies and \nother stakeholders involved in PATA implementation. The PATA will commence in the first \nquarter  of  2009  and  be  completed  in  the  first  quarter  of  2010,  coinciding  with  the  third \nsubprogram.. DBM will procure equipment and software in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The equipment and software will be handed \nover to DBM upon completion of the TA.  \n \n ", "                          Appendix 9        7  5\n12.  A team of international and national consultants will implement the PATA. ADB will \nengage a combination of a consulting firm and individuals to implement all three components, \nthrough simplified technical proposals using quality- and cost-based selection for firms. ADB will \nengage individual consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). A total of 50 (19 international and 31 national) person-\nmonths of consulting will be required.  \n \n13.   The consultants will regularly provide written reports in English: (i) an inception report to \ninclude a comprehensive implementation plan will be submitted within 4 weeks after the PATA \nstarts; (ii) an interim report; (iii) progress reports; and (iv) a draft final report and, subsequently, \na final report to be submitted before the PATA ends. Specific timing and content of the reports \nwill be discussed with DBM. The reports will be submitted to DBM and ADB.  \n \nTable A9: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Total Cost \nA.   Asian Development Bank Financing   \n  1.
