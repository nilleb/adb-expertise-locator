The  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area \n(BIMP-EAGA) cooperation initiative was formally launched in 1994 as a joint strategy of the \nparticipating  governments  to  address  the  social  and  economic  development  of  their  less-\ndeveloped  and  more  remote  territories.  Following  early  gains,  cooperation  development  in \nBIMP-EAGA was disrupted by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. As the economies recovered, \nregional leaders at the seventh Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in \nNovember 2001 supported the revitalization of the BIMP-EAGA cooperation initiative. Between \n2002  and  2003,  BIMP-EAGA  reassessed  its  strategies  and  implemented  structural  and \ninstitutional reforms to strengthen its consultations and dialogue mechanisms. In 2004, with the \nhelp of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners,1 BIMP-EAGA \nbegan the process of developing a new road map to chart the subregion\u2019s economic and \ncooperation development for the following 5 years. At their second summit in Kuala Lumpur in \nDecember  2005,  the  leaders  approved  for  implementation  the  BIMP-EAGA  Road  Map  to \nDevelopment (2006\u20132010).  \n \n2.  The road map has guided the prioritization of the subregion\u2019s cooperation initiatives in \nthe last 2 years. At the fourth summit in November 2007, the leaders supported the decision of \nthe ministers and senior officials to conduct a comprehensive midterm review of the road map to \nensure that the measures being implemented remain relevant and fully support the goals of \nBIMP-EAGA and that targets will be achieved in a timely manner. The leaders also reiterated \nthe ministers\u2019 and senior officials\u2019 request for ADB to support the review process. \n \n3.  BIMP-EAGA is one of two2 subregional cooperation initiatives in archipelagic Southeast \nAsia  that  ADB  supports.  As  BIMP-EAGA\u2019s  regional  development  advisor,  ADB  has  been \nproviding assistance to key BIMP-EAGA initiatives. The proposed regional technical assistance \n(RETA) will give ADB the means to enhance its role by ensuring the accelerated implementation \nof the BIMP-EAGA road map within a results-focused framework.3 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The  subnational  area 4  comprising  BIMP-EAGA  share  the  similar  challenge  of \nconsiderable  geographic  distance  from  their  country's  core  economic  regions.  They  are \nresource-rich island economies that are less developed than the capital regions. BIMP-EAGA \nwas created at a time of prosperity for the participating countries, encouraging the governments \nto undertake activities to narrow in-country development gaps and ensure that the benefits of \neconomic  growth  accrue  to  the  more  remote  territories.  Taking  advantage  of  the  physical \nproximity, cultural affinity, and long history of trade between the EAGA component areas, a \ncooperative strategy was adopted to increase cross-border trade, tourism, and investments, and \npromote  the  integration  of  the  economies  of  the  subregion.  Cooperation  in  this  area  was \nenvisioned to be private sector-led and market driven.  \n                                                 \n1  Including the ASEAN Secretariat and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ, the German \nAgency for Technical Cooperation), that provided the BIMP Facilitation Center with technical assistance. \n2  The other subregional cooperation initiative is the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle. \n3  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 27 March 2008. \n4  The focal subnational areas of BIMP-EAGA are (i) the provinces of Kalimantan, Maluku, Papua, and Sulawesi, in \nIndonesia; (ii) the states of Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan in Malaysia; and (iii) Mindanao \nand Palawan in the Philippines. Brunei Darussalam is a full state member of EAGA. The member countries use the \nterm BIMP-EAGA (or simply EAGA) to refer to the subregional cooperation initiative and the geographic subregion.  \n ", "2   \n \n5.  The strong commitment and support of the government leaders to immediately identify \nand address the structural impediments to growth in the EAGA made early gains possible. \nBetween 1994 and 1997, national policies were modified and cooperative agreements were \nfacilitated to ensure the success of the cooperation initiative. Among other things, transport \npolicies and travel regulations were relaxed, resulting in improved subregional connectivity and \nincreased cross-border movement of people and goods. Business, cultural, and social networks \nwithin the subregion expanded and joint-venture investments in agribusiness, tourism, and \ntrading  increased.  The  1997  financial  crisis,  however,  disrupted  early  plans  and  progress \nslowed. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, the private sector businesses which were \ninitially expected to play the leading role had to retrench staff. Governments were forced to \nfocus on the most urgent nationwide macroeconomic and structural challenges and had little \nfinancial  capacity  to  support  regional  programs.  Public  sector  investments  in  regional \ninfrastructure declined severely, resulting in the further slowdown in the implementation of key \nEAGA development initiatives.  \n \n6.  Growth  in  the  region  resumed  in  late  2001  and  regional  leaders  supported  the \nrevitalization and repositioning of the EAGA. ADB technical assistance played a helpful role in \nthese  efforts. 5  This  renewed  interest  in  the  EAGA  cooperation  initiative  was  an \nacknowledgement  of  the  vital  role  subregional  cooperation  could  play  in  sustaining  the \neconomic  recovery  of  the  EAGA;  however,  it  was  also  aimed  at  supporting  the  broader \nintegration goal of ASEAN. This, along with new challenges arising from a significantly changed \nregional  and  global  economic  environment,  led  the  EAGA  to  reassess  its  approach  to \ncooperation development. As part of the economic integration efforts, the leaders declared \nBIMP-EAGA a test-bed for the implementation of regional agreements and, more recently, as an \nimportant  economic  corridor  in  ASEAN.  To  initialize  the  revitalization  efforts,  the  EAGA \nimplemented important structural reforms, starting with the reprioritization of the sectors for \ncooperation. The creation of a subregional central secretariat\u2014the BIMP Facilitation Center \n(BIMP-FC) \u2014 was another major step taken to ensure continuity of the regional cooperation \neffort through the effective monitoring and coordination of cooperation activities among EAGA \ninstitutions and stakeholders as well as with development partners. Another measure included \nthe restructuring of the private sector umbrella organization, the BIMP-EAGA Business Council \n(BEBC). In 2004, the ninth ministerial meeting approved the preparation of a broad-based \ndevelopment road map to chart BIMP-EAGA\u2019s cooperation activities over the next 5 years. In \n2005, the EAGA leaders approved for implementation the new development road map that is \nfocused  on  enhancing  the  subregion\u2019s  competitive  advantage  through  cross-border \nconsolidation, complementation, industry clustering, and value-chain management. \n \n7.  As embodied in its development road map, the ultimate goal of BIMP-EAGA is to narrow \nthe development gap across and within the EAGA member countries. Road map targets6 were \nestablished alongside its four pillars of (i) promoting intra- and extra-EAGA trade, investments, \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001.

Technical Assistance for Strengthening SME's Regional Networking \nCapacity in BIMP-EAGA. Manila (TA 6146-REG, approved on 5 December, for $700,000). \n6  The road map targets are to increase (i) internal and external trade among EAGA focus areas by 10% by 2010, (ii) \ninvestments in the EAGA subregion by 10% by 2010, and (iii) tourism movement in EAGA by 20% by 2010. \n ", "  3\nand tourism in selected priority sectors (namely agro-industry and natural resources, transport, \ninfrastructure,  and  information  and  communication  technology)  with  particular emphasis  on \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprise  development  in  these  sectors;  (ii)  coordinating  the \nmanagement  of  natural  resources  for  sustainable  development  of  the  subregion;  (iii) \ncoordinating the planning and implementation of infrastructure support to economic integration, \nwith active participation of the private sector; and (iv) strengthening the BIMP-EAGA institutional \nstructures and mechanisms for effective implementation of the EAGA road map and action plan.  \n \n8.  The road map has guided the direction of cooperation activities in BIMP-EAGA in the \nlast 2 years. The EAGA leaders at their fourth summit expressed encouragement over the \nsteady progress in the implementation of the road map. They noted in particular the signing of \nthree landmark subregional transport agreements7 aimed at facilitating cross-border air, sea, \nand land connectivity. In conjunction with the transport agreements, measures to harmonize \nborder formalities were set in motion in 2007.8 These efforts are a major step forward in \naccelerating  economic  integration  and  realizing  EAGA\u2019s  long-term  goal  of  establishing  the \nsubregion as a single production base and tourism destination. BIMP-EAGA countries have also \nintensified  cooperation  in  environmental  management  and  biodiversity  conservation.  The \ncountries have signed cooperation agreements, such as the Heart of Borneo Initiative and the \nSulu Sulawesi Marine Ecoregion, that aim to establish networks of protected forests and marine \nresources through international cooperation led by the governments and supported by a global \neffort.  Other  major  accomplishments  of  BIMP-EAGA  include  (i)  actively  re-engaging  local \ngovernments  in  cooperation  development,  (ii)  implementing  a  communications  strategy \ninvolving the subregion\u2019s private sector media, (iii) adopting a structured project development \nprocess and results-based project monitoring and evaluation framework, and (iv) introducing \nsubregional value chains for priority commodities.   \n \n9.  While accomplishments have been significant, performance of the different sectors has \nbeen  uneven.  Prioritization  and  implementation  of  projects  under  the  natural  resource \ndevelopment sector has met with difficulties. Participating countries tend to continue protecting \ntheir competitive advantage in key industries\u2014such as oil palm, seaweeds, fisheries, and agro-\nindustry\u2014thereby  threatening  the  efficient  establishment  of  subregional  value  chains. \nImplementation of some flagship projects has been delayed by the lack of funding for needed \nsectoral assessments, especially in areas affecting private sector investments. Thus the private \nsector response to public sector actions has been weak in almost all sectors except tourism. \nMoreover, enterprise development in EAGA continues to be constrained by the lack of effective \naccess by small and medium-sized enterprises to equity and credit financing.  \n \n10.  EAGA officials anticipated that these issues would affect the timely implementation of \nthe road map and the realization of the goals and targets. Hence, the senior officials agreed to \nconduct a review of the road map programs and projects to ensure that they are contributing to \nthe realization of the goals of the subregion. There was a strongly articulated need to determine \nif the programs and projects embodied in the development road map remain relevant and \neffective in meeting the current and emerging challenges and opportunities facing BIMP-EAGA \n                                                 \n7  These transport agreements essentially provide the protocol for testing the implementation of related agreements \nof ASEAN and include (i) the \u201copen skies\u201d agreement granting fifth freedom air traffic rights to selected international \nairports (signed in January 2007), (ii) facilitating the cross-border movement of buses and coaches and exchange \nof traffic rights (signed in November 2007), and (iii) strengthening sea route cooperation on designated priority and \npioneer routes (signed in November 2007). \n8  ADB is supporting the BIMP-EAGA initiative to harmonize Customs, Immigration Quarantine and Security rules, \nregulations, and procedures through a regional technical assistance cofinanced by the Cooperation Fund for \nRegional Trade and Financial Security Initiative. \n ", "4   \nwithin the remaining period of the road map and beyond. The senior officials also emphasized \nthe need to confirm that cooperation structures and mechanisms adequately facilitate and \naccelerate the implementation of the development road map.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the RETA is to help accelerate the implementation of the road map. This \nwill involve determining the progress of implementation to date in relation to the road map \ntargets.  Implementation  issues  and  potential  constraints  will  be  identified  and  solutions \nformulated to address them. The outcome will be more focused and results-oriented action \nplans that will directly contribute to achieving the road map goals and targets.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The RETA will focus on helping BIMP-EAGA achieve the two-fold objectives of the \nmidterm review. The main objective will be to (i) comprehensively take stock of the progress \nachieved and the results realized in the implementation of the road map; (ii) identify the various \nissues and challenges facing the implementation of the BIMP-EAGA road map; (iii) identify the \npriorities that BIMP-EAGA should pursue in the remaining period of the road map (2008\u20132010) \nto  achieve  the  road  map  goals,  including  the  accelerated  increase  of  trade,  tourism,  and \ninvestments;  (iv)  determine  if  the  current  institutional  structures  and  mechanisms  are \nappropriate and are facilitating or constraining the accelerated implementation of the road map; \nand  (v)  recommend  changes  or  adjustments to  the  road  map  as  warranted.  A  secondary \nobjective of the midterm review is to identify future priorities that BIMP-EAGA might pursue in \nthe next 5 years (2009\u20132013) based on emerging opportunities in the various sectors. To the \nextent possible, the RETA will endeavor to provide a quantitative assessment of the road map \naccomplishments, even as it acknowledges the difficulties in obtaining updated disaggregated \nstatistics on trade, tourism, and investments for the component areas of the subregion.  \n \n13.  As agreed with the BIMP-EAGA senior officials, the midterm review process will be \nundertaken by the stakeholders themselves with ADB providing technical guidance and expert \nadvice. The senior officials emphasized the need for the active participation of the clusters,9 \nworking groups, and the private sector in the review process. This is to ensure their ownership \nof, and responsibility and accountability for, the results of the performance assessment and the \nsubsequent midterm review report to be presented to the BIMP-EAGA leaders at the fifth \nsummit  in  Thailand  in  December  2008.  The  BIMP  FC  will  lead  the  review  process  in \ncoordination and collaboration with the different national secretariats, clusters, and working \ngroups.  \n \n14.  A lead facilitator will work closely with the head of the BIMP FC in reviewing relevant \ndocuments and reports including agreed action plans, and in designing the midterm review \nworkshops and other consultation activities. The lead facilitator will formulate a scorecard and \nidentify the quantitative and qualitative parameters for objective assessment of the performance \n                                                 \n9  Clustering the working groups was part of the structural reform of 2001\u20132003, when the 11 working groups were \ngrouped into four clusters that now represent the priority areas for development in EAGA as follows: (i) transport, \ninfrastructure, and information and communication technology; (ii) natural resources; (iii) tourism; and (iv) small and \nmedium-sized enterprise development. \n ", "  5\nand contribution of the individual clusters and working groups in realizing the goals of the BIMP-\nEAGA road map.  \n \n15.  Sector experts will be engaged to prepare an assessment of the growth prospects of \npriority industries (e.g., transport and trade logistics, agro-industry, fisheries, and tourism) and \nthe potential competitive advantage of BIMP-EAGA in these industries. Based on their findings, \nthe experts will recommend actions to be adopted by the clusters and working groups to \nenhance EAGA\u2019s competitiveness in these industries. The sector experts will present their \nfindings and recommendations during the workshops, which will serve as additional guides for \nreprioritizing  and  refining  the  activities  and  target  deliverables  of  the  clusters  and  working \ngroups. \n \n16.  Focused group discussions and other consultation activities with such stakeholders as \nthe Local Government Unit Forum, the BEBC, and the BIMP-EAGA Tourism Council will be \nconducted to supplement the review made by the clusters and working groups. This is to obtain \na broader view of the aspirations and expectations of how the BIMP-EAGA cooperation initiative \ncan be best utilized to promote economic development and poverty reduction in the subregion.  \n \n17.  A midterm review task force will be created to function as the core group to review and \ndiscuss the preliminary reports, paying particular attention to the cross-cutting goals of the road \nmap not falling under any specific cluster or working group. The task force will be composed of \n(i) the country chairs of the four clusters, (ii) the national secretariats, (iii) the head of the BIMP-\nEAGA FC, and (iv) the executive vice chairman of the BEBC. A consolidation workshop will \nreview the final draft of the midterm review report.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $300,000 to be financed on a grant basis by \nADB's TA (technical assistance) funding program. The RETA cost estimates and budget are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n19.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, responsible for implementation and \nmonitoring in consultation with the BIMP-EAGA member countries. A no-objection letter will be \nobtained before starting the RETA activities in the territory of the participating member countries. \nImplementation and monitoring of the RETA will be done in close consultation with the BIMP \nFacilitation Center and the midterm review task force. \n \n20.  The RETA will finance about 37 person-months of consultant services (18 international \nand 19 national), including sector experts who will conduct the sector assessment studies. The \nconsultants will be hired as individuals and will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consultants\u2019 \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB will be actively involved in implementing the \ntechnical assistance, including the conduct of workshops facilitated by the RETA, and ADB staff \nwill be used as resource persons when appropriate. \n \n21.  The RETA implementation period is from April to December 2008. \n \n ", "6   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.
