An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared for \nAssessment  representative subprojects and a summary is attached as Appendix 10. \nFor each subsequent subproject proposed under the Project, an IEE will \nbe prepared as one of the subproject approval requirements. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is the first response of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto the needs assessment of conflict-affected areas carried out by ADB \nand others in early 2003. The areas, in the North and East of the \ncountry, make up about 24% of Sri Lanka's land area and contain about \n10% of its population. The assessment, which was presented to the \ninternational  aid  community  at  the  Sri  Lanka  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment  Conference  held  in  Tokyo  in  June  2003,  identified \nimmediate  and  medium-term  rehabilitation  needs  across  all  sectors, \ncosting  about  $1.9  billion,  of  which  about  $700  million  is  required \nimmediately.  The  Project  will  address  the  most  critical  of  these \nimmediate  needs  by  rehabilitating  essential  economic  and  social \ninfrastructure,  thereby  contributing  to  the  restoration  of  community \nlivelihoods in the conflict-affected areas. It will enable people to rebuild \nand  resume  their  normal  lives  by  reconstructing  roads;  power  and \nelectrification  infrastructure;  and  community  facilities  including  small-\nscale  water  supplies,  sanitation,  education,  health,  access  roads, \nrenewable energy, and other community development activities. \n   \nRationale  Since 1983, the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka have been \na battleground, in which about 65,000 people have been killed, many \nmore  have  been  disabled,  and  at  least  800,000  people  have  been \ndisplaced. The whole population of Sri Lanka has suffered from the \nconsequences of the war, but the North and East and the adjacent areas \nhave borne the brunt of the conflict. Livelihoods, particularly for the poor \nin the conflict-affected areas, have been destroyed. Much of the physical \ninfrastructure  and  the  means  of  production  have  been  damaged, \ndestroyed,  or  have  deteriorated  over  time.  The  conflict  has  been  a \nconstraint  to  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  It  has  not  only  caused \nextensive suffering and dislocation but has also sharply reduced the \neconomic contribution of the region to national development, required \ndefense expenditures that became unsustainable, restrained growth in \nsocial expenditures, discouraged investment, and stifled tourism.  \n \nResumption of economic life and re-establishment of normal livelihood \ndepend  critically  on  rehabilitation  of  key  infrastructure  facilities  and \nrestoration of communities. The ceasefire that commenced in February \n2002 and continues to be in effect has provided the opportunity for \nsupporting these essential activities. ", "iv   \nObjectives and  The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  support  rehabilitation  of  essential \nScope  infrastructure  and  restoration  of  community  livelihoods  in  the  most \nseverely conflict-affected areas of the North and East, predominantly in \nthe  districts  of  Jaffna,  Mannar,  Kilinochchi,  Mullaittivu,  Vavuniya, \nTrincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara. \n   \nThe Project will focus on the highest priority sectors and areas for which \nADB\u2019s assistance is most appropriate, based on the needs assessment \nand reflecting consultations with the Government, development partners, \nthe  Liberation  Tamils  of  Tiger  Eelam  (LTTE),  local  communities, \nnongovernment organizations, and others. \n \nThe Project is being prepared and will be implemented using a sector \napproach, through which subprojects will be selected on the basis of \npre-agreed  criteria.  It  will  include  the  following  components:  (i) \nrehabilitation  of  about  500  kilometers  (km)  of  national  roads;  (ii) \nrehabilitation of power transmission, distribution, and rural electrification; \nand  (iii)  smaller-scale  community  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nactivities, such as schools, water supplies, health centers, minor roads, \nrenewable  energy,  income  generation  opportunities,  and  others,  for \nconflict-affected communities throughout the project area. It will also \nfinance a feasibility study for water supply and sanitation systems for the \nJaffna Peninsula, where the lack of such systems largely because of the \nconflict has resulted in a serious public health crisis. \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated total cost is $107.9 million equivalent inclusive of taxes, \nduties, and fee and charges during implementation.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nComponents  ADB   Gov\u2019t  Ben.

The proposed ADB loans are SDR35,024,000 ($50 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  [ADF])  and  $30  million  equivalent  from  ADB's \nordinary capital resources (OCR).  \n  \n \n ", "  v\n  The ADF loan will have a 40-year term including a grace period of 10 \nyears, with an annual interest rate of 1.0%, with repayment of principal \nat 2% a year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year \nthereafter.  For  the  OCR  loan,  the  interest  will  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate-based lending \nfacility, with a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, with a \nfront-end fee of 0.5% and a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum. \n \nPeriod of  Until June 2008 \nUtilization   \n   \nEstimated Project  December 2007 (about a 4-year period of implementation). \nCompletion Date  As the area was a battleground of ethnic and communal tensions for the \nlast two decades, which destroyed not only physical assets but also the \nhuman capacity in the area, extra efforts and time are necessary for \nclearing  mines  and  unexploded  ordnance,  for  ensuring  community \nparticipation, proper targeting, and adequate control and monitoring, and \nfor  addressing  capacity  constraints.  To  be  able  to  perform  these \nactivities properly, the Project needs a longer period of implementation \ncompared with that of a rehabilitation project after natural disasters. \n   \nExecuting Agency  For Component A, the executing agency (EA) will be the Ministry of \nHighways (MOH) and the implementing agency (IA) will be the Road \nDevelopment Authority (RDA). For Component B, the EA will be the \nMinistry of Power and Energy (MOPE) and the IA will be the Ceylon \nElectricity Board (CEB).  For Component C, the EA will be the Ministry of \nHome Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government (MHAPCLG) \nand  the  IA  will  be  the  North  East  Provincial  Council  (NEPC).  For \nComponent D, the EA will be the Ministry of Housing and Plantation \nInfrastructure (MHPI) and the IA will be the National Water Supply and \nDrainage Board (NWSDB). MHAPCLG will be the coordinating EA. \n   \nImplementation  A  national  project  committee  will  be  established  to  oversee  overall \nArrangements  project implementation at the national level. It will be co-chaired by the \nsecretaries  of  the  MHAPCLG  and  the  MOH,  and  will  include \nrepresentatives of the MOPE, MHPI, Ministry of Policy Development and \nImplementation,  Commissioner-General  for  Relief  Rehabilitation  and \nReconciliation, Ministry of Relief, Rehabilitation and Refugees; Ministry \nof Eastern Development and Muslim Religious Affairs; Ministry Assisting \nVanni Rehabilitation; the IAs; and ADB. The committee will meet at least \ntwice each year. \n \nA project coordination committee (PCC) will be established to coordinate \nproject activities, to maintain effective high-level contact with the LTTE, \nto ensure proper implementation of the Project, and to resolve project-\nwide implementation issues. Supported by a small secretariat, the PCC \nwill be chaired by the chief secretary of the NEPC, and will comprise \nrepresentatives from all IAs as well as the MHAPCLG other relevant \nagencies, and ADB.  The PCC will meet periodically to, among other \nthings, review, prioritize,and approve subproject proposals. \n   \n ", "vi   \n  The  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  all  activities  within  their  respective \ncomponents.  Existing  project  management  units  for  related  ADB-\nfinanced projects, appropriately strengthened, will assume responsibility \nfor the project activities within their sector components. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  with  the  Government\u2019s \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n  Components A and C, due to the wide geographical spread of the \nproject  sites,  the  need  for  local  knowledge  of  security  and  other \nfrequently-changing matters relevant to accessing the project area, and \nthe small scale of most packages, are not likely to attract international \ncontractors and suppliers. In addition, detailed designs for the works will \nnot be prepared before bidding; rather, works will be bid upon based on \nsimple standard designs and quantities to be refined during construction. \nTherefore,  for  these  components,  local  procurement  procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB  will  be  the  preferred  mode.  For  Component  B, \nspecifically for the larger transmission line subcomponent, international \nprocurement procedures will be adopted. \n   \nConsulting  Consulting services will be required for components A, C, and D, and will \nServices  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Reflecting the need to commence \nproject  activities  quickly,  the  following  arrangements  will  be \nimplemented. For Component A, RDA will select the consultant from \namong  the  four  consortia  of  international  and  domestic  consultants \nalready engaged in ongoing national road sector projects in Sri Lanka. \nSelection  will  be  based  on  simplified  technical  proposals  under  the \nquality-cost-based selection method. For Component C and for overall \nproject  coordination,  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  under  a \nnegotiated  contract  with  the  existing  consultant  for  the  ADB-funded \nNorth  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project.  For \nComponent  D,  full  proposals  will  be  invited  from  the  short-listed \nconsultants that passed technical qualification as approved by ADB for \nthe Secondary Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, and will be \nevaluated based on full technical proposals using the quality-cost-based \nselection  method.  Overall,  about  100  and  1570  person-months  of \ninternational  and  domestic  consultant  inputs,  respectively,  will  be \nrequired for the Project. \n   \nProject Benefits  The conflict-affected areas experience poverty levels estimated to range \nand Beneficiaries  from 60% to 90%, which are much higher than the rest of the country. As \nthe  needs  assessment  so  clearly  revealed,  little  economic  or  social \ninfrastructure remains intact, and what is present has long passed its \nuseful life. Until this infrastructure is restored, it will not be possible for \ncommunities in the areas to restore their livelihoods, even to a very \nbasic  level,  and  begin  the  long  process  of  catching  up  with  the \ndevelopment that has been available to the rest of the country for the \npast two decades. \n  \n \n ", "  vii \n  The Project will address urgent needs of the almost 2 million conflict-\n  affected people in the project area. Many are physically disabled people, \nwomen-headed  households,  and  children.  These  people  are  now \nbeginning  to  rebuild  their  lives  in  an  area  that  has  been  either \ndevastated by conflict or suffered through many years of neglect. In \nparticular, the beneficiaries will be communities served by the Project's \nroads, the electricity, and the small-scale activities undertaken under the \nProject's community restoration and development component. \n \n  They will benefit from improved infrastructure, giving them improved \naccess to economic opportunities and social services, and reducing their \nisolation from other parts of the country. Where appropriate, primarily for \ncomponents  A  and  C,  the  works  will  be  designed  to  be  within  the \ncapabilities  and  resources  of  domestic  contractors  and  community-\nbased organizations. This will provide domestic contractors and local \ncommunities  with  the  opportunities  to  develop  their  capacity  to \nundertake works of this nature, and begin the process of developing a \nfunctioning economy in the area that has been largely reduced to relying \non subsistence support from the Government. \n   \nRisks and  The major risk is that the Project, through poor targeting and inadequate \nAssumptions  control and monitoring, will exacerbate the tensions that ultimately led to \nconflict. Assuming that project benefits are shared equitably among the \nmajor ethnic groups and across the project area, the Project will not \ncontribute to an intensification of social tensions. Rather, the Project will \ncontribute positively to the rebuilding of communities in the conflict-\naffected  areas  and  to  beginning  the  long  process  of  economic \ndevelopment. The Project has been designed, and will be implemented \nin a manner, to ensure that balances among ethnic groups and regions \nwithin  the  Project  areas  are  carefully  managed,  and  that  there  is \ntransparency and complete community ownership of its activities. \n \n   \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Conflict Affected Areas Rehabilitation \nProject. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Since 1983, Sri Lanka's Northern and Eastern provinces have been a battleground \nbetween the Government army and the Liberation Tamils of Tiger Eelam (LTTE). Some 65,000 \npeople have been killed, several times as many have been disabled, and at least 800,000 have \nbeen displaced. While the whole population of Sri Lanka has suffered from the consequences of \nthe war, the North and East and its adjacent areas have borne the brunt of the conflict. \n \n3.  In February 2002 the Government and the LTTE signed a ceasefire agreement and \nbegan the long process of negotiating a permanent end to the conflict. While this will require \nmuch more time, patience, and goodwill to achieve, there are already clear signs that normalcy \nis  returning  to  the  country  and  to  the  most  intensely  conflict-affected  areas  in  particular. \nHundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees are returning to \ntheir homes in large numbers, usually to find that their villages have been devastated; schools \nand community facilities no longer function; and basic infrastructure for access, agriculture, \nshelter, income generation, and most other needs requires complete rehabilitation. In a true \npost-conflict situation, such needs would require urgent attention to bring relief to people who \nhave lost almost everything, but also to remove the potential for the absence of such relief to \nrekindle conflict. Sri Lanka is not yet in such a post-conflict situation; an effective ceasefire is in \nplace, but the conflict has yet to formally end. Relief and rehabilitation thus become critical \nfactors in moving the peace process forward. Peace dividends, for the people and areas directly \naffected by the conflict and for the country as a whole, are essential for providing a foundation \nfor peace and, where ethnic differences have played so large a role in initiating and prolonging \nthe conflict, for community reconciliation.  \n \n4.  The Government, the LTTE, and the international community clearly recognize the \nlinkage between peace and development; that the achievement of the former will to a large \nextent depend on effective implementation of the latter. The multilateral agencies operating in \nSri Lanka\u2014the United Nations family, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nin particular\u2014gave substance to this recognition by undertaking a comprehensive assessment \nof  relief  and  reconstruction  needs  for  the  country\u2019s  most  seriously  conflict-affected  areas, \nprimarily the eight districts that make up the Northern and Eastern provinces and the areas of \nthe four districts adjacent to them that have also been impacted by the conflict (Map). The \noutcome of the assessment1, available as Supplementary Appendix A, was presented to the \ninternational community at the Sri Lanka Reconstruction and Development Conference, held in \nTokyo in June 2003. The assessment took into account the thoughts and wishes of a very wide \nrange of stakeholders, including government ministries responsible for relief and rehabilitation \nactivities, government agencies based in the North and East, the LTTE and its agencies, \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  community  groups,  IDPs,  and  many  others.  The \nproposed Project, for which a project framework is presented in Appendix 1, is the ADB\u2019s first \nresponse  to  the  needs  assessment.  It  represents  the  outcome  of  wide  consultation  with \nstakeholders, including the LTTE, who contributed to the design of the Project. Reflecting the \nurgency of the immediate rehabilitation program, the Project has been prepared under ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n1 Sri Lanka Assessment of Needs in the Conflict Affected Areas (May 2003) prepared by the Government of Sri \nLanka with support from ADB, United Nations, and World Bank (the needs assessment). ", "2  \ndisaster rehabilitation procedures as appropriate and in anticipation of ADB\u2019s forthcoming policy \non disaster and emergency assistance being prepared during the processing of the Project. 2 \n \nA.  Existing Situation \n \n5.  Of the eight districts making up the Northern and Eastern provinces, effectively the \nproposed project area, the LTTE controls Kilinochchi and Mullaittivu districts completely, and \ncontrols substantial portions of the remaining ones. Prior to the conflict, these districts had a \npopulation of about 2.1 million, with Jaffna having the largest and Mullaittivu the lowest. Due to \nthe conflict, there have been significant population movements in all districts and into the \nbordering districts. Present populations are uncertain, since figures vary considerably between \ndifferent sources. However, it does appear that populations in Ampara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, \nVavuniya, and Mannar have increased, while there have been substantial decreases in the \npopulations of Jaffna, Mullaittivu, and Kilinochchi. In adjacent districts, particularly Puttalam and \nAnuradhapura, large numbers of IDPs live. \n \n6.  In early 2002, prior to the ceasefire, there were some 800,000 IDPs from the North and \nEast and contiguous areas, many of whom were women and children. About 91,000 IDPs lived \nin 264 welfare centers around the country; the rest lived with family and friends. Up to a million \npeople left the country, with about 100,000 of them having fled to India. Since the ceasefire \nagreement was signed, over 270,000 IDPs have spontaneously returned to their areas of origin \ndespite the adverse conditions of security uncertainty, mine contamination, land and property \nrights issues, and lack of infrastructure and basic services. Many of these returnees now exist in \nconditions little better than those they experienced in the welfare centers. \n \n7.  Livelihoods, particularly for the poor in the conflict-affected areas, have been destroyed, \nand devastation and land mines await many of the returnees. Not only did the war cause losses \nof income and property, it also caused death, injury, psychological stress, and war-related \ntrauma. Much of the physical infrastructure and the means of production have been damaged or \ndestroyed, or have deteriorated over time. Their replacement and rehabilitation is essential if \neconomic life is to resume and normal livelihoods are to be re-established. \n \n8.  The conflict has been a constraint to growth and poverty reduction. It has not only \ncaused extensive suffering and dislocation in the region but has also sharply reduced the \neconomic  contribution  of  the  region  to  national  development,  led  to  mounting  defense \nexpenditures, restrained growth in social expenditures, discouraged investment, and stifled \ntourism. It has been estimated that the conflict reduced annual growth rates by 2% for the \ncountry over the past two decades. The impact in the conflict area has been even worse. \nParagraphs 9-17 provide a brief overview of the present situation in the areas and for the \nsectors that would be addressed by the proposed Project. Amounts where mentioned have \nbeen extracted from the needs assessment report. \n \n9.  The road system, although largely inadequate prior to the conflict, was reasonably well \nmaintained, but currently all pavement surfaces have deteriorated, and some have entirely \ndisappeared.  Bridges and culverts have been destroyed. Less than 15% of the road surface in \nthe region is still intact. Where access is possible, riding conditions are poor, vehicle speeds are \nlow,  and  vehicle-operating  costs  are  high.  The  conflict  has  also  caused  stagnation  in \ninfrastructure development. The poor condition of the road system is one of the constraints \npreventing  people  and  returning  IDPs  and  refugees  from  gaining  access  to  economic \n                                                 \n2  ADB's Guidelines on Operational Procedures 25 and Operations Manual \u2013 Policies and Procedures: Rehabilitation \nAssistance after Disaster (1995); and ADB\u2019s Policy on Disaster and Emergency Assistance (W-Paper, 2003). \n  \n \n ", "  3\nopportunities and good quality services. Although some of the damaged or destroyed structures \nhave been temporarily repaired or replaced, and all significant roads are now open to traffic, \nthey have a limited capacity and need to be replaced with permanent and adequate structures. \nIt is estimated that about $90 million is required for immediate road rehabilitation and further \n$180 million is required over the next 6 years. \n \n10.  For power, due to the conflict the percentage of households currently electrified in the \nNorthern Province is 22% and in the Eastern Province 40%, as against a national average of \n60%. The power supply to the north was through the transmission line from Anuradhapura to \nJaffna and the grid substations at Kilinochchi and Jaffna. To provide supply to the Jaffna district, \ndiesel-powered  generators  were  installed  by  an  independent  power  producer.  In  power \ntransmission, about 145 kilometers (km) of transmission line between Vavuniya and Jaffna has \nbeen  destroyed.  In  the  east,  a  132  kilovolt  (kV)  line  and  a  grid  substation  were  under \nconstruction but were not completed because of the conflict.  \n \n11.  There has been considerable damage to the power distribution system though the \ndamage in the Eastern Province is slightly less than the Northern. In the latter, 90% of the \ndistribution system suffered damage, but nearly 50% of the lines in Jaffna district have now \nbeen repaired. In Mannar district there was about 50% damage, but most repairs have been \ndone. Vavuniya suffered about 70% damage, and 20% still need to be repaired. Systems in \nMullaittivu and Kilinochchi, both areas controlled by the LTTE, were destroyed and no repairs \nhave been carried out. Overall, about $41 million and $105 million, respectively, are required for \nimmediate and medium-term power system rehabilitation. \n \n12.   For water supply, limited piped water is available in all major towns except Kilinochchi \nand Mullaittivu, where the systems are completely destroyed. In most towns these services are \nlimited to 1-2 hours per day in a very limited service area. In many urban schemes the overhead \nwater reservoirs and the distribution networks have been damaged or destroyed. Most rural \nwater facilities are also in a depleted state. Water supply and sanitation facilities in most \nhospitals and schools have been destroyed or neglected. Ground water contamination in urban \nareas due to the use of soakage pits has been identified as a major health hazard. The \nproportion of households that have access to safe water supply in the North and East is only \n20% as compared to 45% nationally, and access to sanitation is 25% compared to the national \naverage of 72%. All districts confirm the presence of preventable intestinal disease, with many \nreporting the emergence of typhoid and cholera epidemics, indicating faecal pollution of the \nwater resource. Immediate action is required to improve water supply and sanitation systems, \nwhich require about $45 million and $64 million in the next 2 and 6 years, respectively. \n \n13.  The Jaffna Peninsula is particularly badly affected by the war. Since Jaffna has  no \nsurface watercourse, most water is extracted from shallow groundwater and surface storage \nbehind desalination barrages, most of which have been destroyed. The situation is compounded \nby Jaffna\u2019s unusual geology: a relatively thin soil cover over impermeable limestone bedrock. \nThe result is that water is being drawn from the same thin aquifer that is absorbing the city\u2019s \nwaste, leading to a serious increase in waterborne diseases, including cholera. Under this \npeculiar situation, there are immediate needs to carefully investigate, study, and design the \nwater resources management comprehensively, as a basis for the more reliable solution to \nprovide the Jaffna peninsula with a safe water supply and sanitation systems. \n \n14.  Irrigation schemes serve the role of providing water for all farming needs. Of the total of \n323,700 hectares (ha) under irrigation in the North and East, large to medium schemes amount \nto 266,700 ha while 57,000 ha are under minor schemes. Due to the conflict and consequent \nabandonment, irrigation schemes are in  a very poor condition. The immediate needs are to \n   \n ", "4  \nrepair the breach and damage to the main head works and to clear the overgrowth in the \nschemes, so that farmers can commence cultivation of at least part of their paddy lands and \nprovide some form of food security as well as income. Requirements estimated to improve \nirrigation systems are about $52 million immediately and $81 million in the next 6 years.  \n \n15.  The education system, from pre-school to tertiary and technical-vocational, is severely \ndamaged. Problems such as nonenrollment, dropouts, absenteeism, and poor learning quality \nare  aggravated  as  a  consequence  of  displacement,  poverty,  single-headed  households, \ndamaged infrastructure, and lack of human resources. There are about 1,970 schools in the \nregion, with a total enrollment of about 648,000. The rate of student drop out is 15%, almost four \ntimes the national average. About 50,000 children are out of school. \n \n16.  Following the ceasefire, student numbers are expected to return overall by about 6%-9% \nannually as IDPs return, dropout rates fall, and retention and transition rates rise. These \nimprovements will require an increase in school capital stock, such as buildings, basic facilities, \nfurniture, equipment, literature and material, as well as an increase in qualified teachers. As \neducation is of paramount importance in restoring normalcy and security, rehabilitation of the \nsystem will be very important in the overall processes of peace building and reconciliation. It is \nestimated that rehabilitation of education system will require about $55.5 million immediately \nand $61 million in the next 6 years.  \n \n17.  Health care services, in terms of availability, accessibility, and quality, have all been \naffected leading to increased mortality and morbidity. Malaria and other preventable diseases, \nonce well controlled, are now widely spread. Health infrastructure has suffered heavy damage \nor destruction, particularly in the North. Many health institutions are totally destroyed or not \nfunctioning. Many others are in disarray due to lack of maintenance. Damage extends to the \nhealth system's water supply, sanitation, and electricity systems. Estimated immediate and \nmedium-term needs for health facilities are $37.7 million and $46.7 million, respectively.  \n \nB.  The Government's Strategy  \n \n18.  The Government recognizes that peace is the key to reducing conflict-related poverty; it \nis the critical pillar upon which the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy3 is based. The \nGovernment's policy on relief and rehabilitation aims to bring the population affected by the \nconflict back to productive life by providing basic amenities to help the people to create a \nphysically, economically, and socially sustainable environment for their reintegration. In 1999, \nthe Government, supported by its development partners, initiated a Relief, Reconstruction, and \nRehabilitation Framework process to address challenges in the delivery assistance to the \nconflict-affected areas. The framework, prepared based on extensive and wide consultations, \nprovides  overall  guidance  on  relief  modalities,  institution  building,  rehabilitation,  and \nreconstruction. The policy prescriptions address vital issues including the observance of human \nrights and basic rights of displaced persons; the intimate linkages between relief, rehabilitation \nand development; decentralization of program management and coordination; the issues of \nlanguage  parity  and  nation-building;  the  need  to  look  at  security  concerns  in  a  wider \nperspective; and the need to make urgent preparations for the transition to peace. \n                                                 \n3  Government of Sri Lanka 2002.  Regaining Sri Lanka  - Connecting to Growth: Poverty Reduction Strategy. \nColombo. \n  \n \n ", "  5\nC.  External Assistance \n \n19.  International and domestic agencies have been working in the area, supporting a wide \nrange of activities including resettlement, relocation, and rehabilitation activities. A summary of \nthe major activities is provided in Appendix 2. The United Nations High Commissioner for \nRefugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross play a vital humanitarian and \nsecurity role. Other agencies include the Food and  Agriculture Organization, United Nations \nChildren Fund, United Nations Development Programme, World Food Programme, bilateral \nagencies, and large number of international and domestic NGOs. The World Bank is supporting \nrehabilitation of irrigation schemes and community-based social and economic infrastructure. \nBilateral  sources,  including  Australia,  Netherlands,  Norway,  and  United  Kingdom  are  also \nsupporting small rehabilitation and income generation activities. \n \n20.  At present, ADB and the World Bank are providing the largest volume of support to the \nNorth and East. ADB, through the North East Community Restoration and Development Project \n(NECORD),  approved  in  2001  for  $25  million,  with  cofinancing  from  the  Organization  of \nPetroleum Exporting Countries Fund, and the governments of Germany and the Netherlands, is \nproviding significant support for the rehabilitation program, with interventions covering health \nand  education  facilities,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  agriculture,  shelter,  roads,  income \ngeneration and many others.4 ADB is also providing support, through other programs, for road \nand power sector rehabilitation. The World Bank has approved two conflict-related projects, one \nfocusing on village recovery through the reconstruction of small-scale irrigation facilities, and the \nother covering a wide range of other activities including payment of resettlement grants to IDPs. \n \n21.  Ongoing development projects that have significant components for the North and East \ninclude:  the  World  Bank-financed  Basic  Education  Project;  ADB-financed  Third  Road \nImprovement  Project,5  Secondary  Education  Modernization  Project,6  Aquatic  Resource \nDevelopment and Quality Improvement,7 and Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation;8  and  the  German  Government-financed  Primary  Education \nProject, Teachers In-Service Training Project, and Integrated Food Security Project. United \nNations agencies and bilateral programs support a very large number of smaller projects, \nprimarily focusing on relief and immediate rehabilitation activities. \n \nD.  Lessons Learned  \n \n22.  A review of ADB-wide experience with rehabilitation assistance indicates that projects \nshould (i) be prepared as quickly as possible, (ii) focus on restoring facilities, (iii) feature a \nflexible implementation process, (iv) provide strong consulting support and ADB supervision \nduring implementation, (v) be supported by equally quick action by the Government, and (vi) be \ncompleted entirely.9 \n \n23.  Other  lessons  learned  from  earlier  assistance  in  the  North  and  East  include:  (i) \nbeneficiary participation must be ensured during project preparation and implementation; (ii) \nenvironment and social aspects should be considered during implementation, since the need for \nrapid response may not permit a detailed treatment prior to the approval of the project; (iii) \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

The proposed Project has been carefully designed to reflect each of these lessons. \n \nE.   The Asian Development Bank's Strategy  \n \n24.  The Poverty Partnership Agreement10 between the Government and ADB states that \nADB will assist in addressing conflict-related poverty by (i) supporting the relief, rehabilitation, \nand reconciliation process and post-conflict planning together with other external agencies; (ii) \nproviding selective rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance to the conflict-affected areas; (iii) \nincluding specific components in development projects aimed at addressing the needs of the \nconflict-affected  poor  and  providing  support  for  conflict  prevention;  and  (iv)  building  local \ncapacities to support the Government's decentralization policy.  \n \n25.  The  Country  Strategy  and  Program  for  Sri  Lanka  2004-200811  supports  the \nGovernment's efforts in (i) implementing the economic reform program, (ii) promoting regionally \nbalanced development, (iii) rehabilitating and reconstructing the conflict-affected areas, and (iv) \nreducing poverty. ADB operational priorities will aim to maximize development impacts and \npeace dividends while contributing to the strategic objectives. The civil conflict in the North and \nEast was identified as one of the basic causes of poverty, not only in the North and East but \nalso throughout the entire country. Strategic support and meaningful interventions will help to \nsupport  the  ongoing  peace  process  and  address  the  conflict-related  poverty  through \nrehabilitation and reconstruction. Regionally balanced development is crucial to supporting the \npeace process, promoting social stability, and enhancing efforts in poverty reduction through \nhigher and sustained economic growth for the whole country. The economic reform program will \ninstall the necessary policy and institutional framework to improve efficiency in all sectors. \n \n26.  During the Sri Lanka Reconstruction Conference held in Tokyo in June 2003, ADB \ndeclared its commitment to providing peace-supporting assistance to Sri Lanka. The proposed \nProject, which is based on the needs assessment and wide consultation with the Government, \nthe LTTE, and others, will address a small portion of the identified immediate and medium-term \nneeds throughout the conflict-affected areas.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n27.  The objective of the Project is to rehabilitate and reconstruct essential infrastructure and \nto improve living conditions in the areas severely affected by the conflict, particularly in the eight \ndistricts of the Northern and Eastern provinces12 and conflict-affected divisions of the four \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2002.

Components and Outputs \n  1.  Component A: Road Rehabilitation  \n \n28.  The objective of Component A is to provide a reliable transport network in the conflict-\naffected areas, where most of the network is presently in very poor condition. The rehabilitation \nof strategic road links throughout the region will help provide an enabling environment to \npromote economic growth and community development. Rehabilitation will consist of low-cost \nintermediate interventions to bring the deteriorated roads up to an all-weather maintainable \ncondition. The scope of the component will comprise urgently needed rehabilitation of about 500 \nkm of the major road links (Class A and B) that are in extremely poor condition and require \nimmediate maintenance as they have high priority for restoring reliable access throughout the \nNorth and East. Capacity building of the nascent construction industry in the conflict-affected \nareas will also be provided. Appendix 3 provides selection criteria and the list of candidate roads \nthat are not only the highest priority but also the lower priority that could be rehabilitated in the \nevent that additional funding becomes available. The roads included in the list have been \nselected after extensive consultation with all stakeholders, including the LTTE, on the basis of \neconomic value, geographical distribution, and ethnic or community balance. \n \n29.  Basic rehabilitation will be executed to provide a low-cost all weather access that will \nsuffice until a more substantial reconstruction program can commence. It will also provide \nreplacement of small, damaged roadway bridges and some ferries. The road network will have \nthe capacity to serve present and future traffic demands for up to 10 years, allowing for more \nsubstantial improvement projects to be implemented progressively over this period. The road \nworks will include location and removal of mines and unexploded ordnance, reconstruction of \npreviously surfaced roads, drainage improvements and clearing, and repair or replacement of \nbridges as necessary. As the works will be carried out within the existing right-of-way, neither \nland acquisition nor resettlement will be required.  \n \n  2.  Component B: Power and Electrification \n \n30.  The objective of Component B is to restore what had previously been a functioning \nelectricity supply in the North and East, particularly in the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, and Mullaitivu \nareas. The transmission backbone, previously in place between Anuradhapura and Jaffna, \nneeds to be restored. In parallel, the distribution  network  threading  from  the  transmission \nbackbone must be rebuilt. The details of Component B are in Appendix 4. \n31.  Power Generation.  As the connectivity with the national grid can only come after the \ntransmission backbone is completed, a  short-term generation facility of about 2 megawatts \n(MW)  will  be  installed  by  the  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  (CEB)  as  quickly  as  possible  in \nKilinochchi. The Project will reconstruct the distribution system that will evacuate the power from \nthe plant to consumers in Kilinochchi town and the surrounding area.  \n32.  Power Transmission.  The  transmission  backbone  comprises  three  major  132  kV \nsegments: Jaffna  - Kilinochchi, Vavuniya  - Kilinochchi, and Anuradhapura  - Vavuniya. It is \nenvisaged by the Government that the transmission line between Anuradhapura and Vavuniya \n                                                 \n13 Anuradhapura, Moneragala, Polonnaruwa, and Puttalam. \n   \n ", "8  \nwill be augmented to a 220 kV line. Since the line from Jaffna to Kilinochchi may be funded by a \nbilateral agency, the Project will focus on the transmission of power between Vavuniya \u2013 \nKilinochchi, including location and removal of mines and unexploded ordnance, and a grid \nsubstation in Kilinochchi. \n33.  Power Distribution and Rural Electrification.  Due to the conflict, the districts of the \nNorthern Province have the lowest electrification ratio compared to other areas in the country, \nand the electrification ratio is particularly low in Mullaittivu, Mannar, and Kilinochchi. The Project \nwill rehabilitate distribution networks and rural electrification in the North and East, including \nlocation and removal of mines and unexploded ordnance. As power systems in districts like \nKilinochchi  have  been  practically  destroyed,  the  project  funds  will  reconnect  clusters  of \nhabitants in these areas through distribution and rural networks between Vavuniya and Elephant \nPass. However, these facilities are dependent on the short-term availability of power generation \nin Kilinochchi (para. 31) as well as reconstruction of transmission lines to the area (para. 32). \n  3.  Component C: Community Restoration and Development \n \n34.  Component C (Appendix 5) will include rehabilitation of (i) small-scale water supply, (ii) \nsanitation, (iii) irrigation, (iv) education and health facilities, (v) village and rural access roads, \n(vi)  renewable  energy,  and  (vii)  other  community  livelihood  restoration  activities.  The \ncommunity-focused restoration and reconstruction will include small-scale community-based \ninfrastructure,  as  prioritized  by  the  communities.  Methodologies  conducive  to  community \nparticipation,  local  capacity  building,  and  the  provision  of  employment  will  be  introduced, \ncomprising  (i)  introduction  and  training  to  local-level  planners  in  appropriate  planning \nmethodologies  such  as  integrated  rural  accessibility  planning;  (ii)  applying  a  labor-based, \nequipment-supported technology approach; and (iii) promoting small-scale contracting. If the \nneed arises, de-mining of project sites and pathways leading to the infrastructure sites will be \ndone. Beneficiaries' contributions will be included in this component.  \n \n35.  Especially  in  areas  where  IDPs  are  returning,  the  small-scale  water  supply \nsubcomponent will include (i) rehabilitation of water supply schemes in total disrepair, (ii) \nprovision of bowsers and plastic holding tanks, (iii) replacement of destroyed truck and tractor \ntrailer mounted bowsers to be used for provision of drinking water, (iv) repair or replacement of \ngenerator sets to provide uninterrupted electricity supplies to run existing water supply facilities, \nand (v) repair of hand pump tube wells and dug wells to serve families. \n \n36.  The  sanitation  subcomponent  will  include  rehabilitation  of  sanitary  facilities  for \nhouseholds, schools, and medical facilities. The approach and procedures of implementation of \nthe water supply and sanitation subcomponents will be in accordance with the National Policy \nfor Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector, particularly in a community participation process \napproach including cost-sharing arrangements, selection of technology, procurement of small \nworks by beneficiaries, and participation of local government in the implementation.  \n \n37.  The irrigation subcomponent will include rehabilitation of existing medium and small \nirrigation schemes. The works will include rehabilitation of tank bunds, channel system, access \nroads, and other structures, without changes to, or diversions of, natural watercourses. The \nsubcomponent will also include the rehabilitation of barrages in the Jaffna Peninsula. \n \n38.  The  education  subcomponent  will  rehabilitate  facilities  and  other  support  required \nimmediately to restore the education services, including (i) rehabilitation and reconstruction of \nschool buildings, (ii) restoration of school furniture, (iii) restoration of library and laboratory \nfacilities, (iv) rehabilitation of limited accommodation facilities for teachers in rural areas, (v) \n  \n \n ", "  9\nrehabilitation of water supply and sanitation services, and (vi) provision of teacher training on \nselected subjects as necessary. \n \n39.  The road subcomponent will consist primarily of the labor-intensive restoration of gravel-\nsurfaced rural roads connecting villages to the road network, irrigation schemes, or community \nfacilities, and a small number of higher-level provincial roads with all-weather surfaces. All road \nconstruction will be on existing alignments and will not require land acquisition or resettlement.   \n \n40.  The  health  subcomponent  will  include  rehabilitation  of  community  health  centers, \nincluding building, water supply, sewage system, paramedic quarters, offices, and provision of \nequipment and a mobile clinic. \n \n41.  The small-scale renewable energy subcomponent will be implemented in isolated rural \ncommunities where interconnection does not prove to be cost effective, initially on a pilot basis. \n \n42.  The  community  livelihood  restoration  subcomponent  will  include  rehabilitation  of \ncommunity infrastructure, regeneration of community economic activities, and reinforcement of \ncommunity  conflict  resolution  mechanisms  and  support  for  conflict-affected  children.  The \nactivities will help in the economic and social rehabilitation of severely affected groups like \nphysically disabled persons and widowed women. \n \n4.  Component D: Jaffna Peninsula Water Supply Feasibility Study \n \n43.  Component D is a comprehensive study of the water resources in the Jaffna peninsula \nand  the  adjacent  area.14  This  immediate  activity  was  required  as  identified  in  the  needs \nassessment,  because  of  its  critical  linkage  to  health,  education,  shelter,  and  economic \ndevelopment outcomes. The Jaffna Peninsula, more than any other part of the conflict-affected \narea, is afflicted by avoidable waterborne diseases, as a consequence of its high IDP density, \nunusual  topography  and  morphology,  and  the  intense  conflict  that  took  place  there. The \noutcome of the study will be sufficient to quickly prepare an investment project that will begin the \nprocess of providing the peninsula with safe and reliable water supply and sanitation systems.  \nThe outline terms of reference is in Appendix 6. \n \nC.  Special Features \n44.  The Project has been formulated on the basis of a package of especially urgent needs. \nFor normal life to resume, infrastructure destroyed must be rebuilt, social services must be \nrestored,  people  must  have  access  to  employment  opportunities  and,  in  the  very  special \ncircumstances of there as yet being no formal end to the conflict and the intense ethnic tensions \nthat initiated the conflict, the peace process must be supported by parallel rehabilitation and \ndevelopment. The people must see a rapid peace dividend, a reason not to return to conflict.  \n \n45.   Specifically for the power sector, a functional electricity network would not be possible \nwithout  all  components,  including  reconstruction  of  the  Vavuniya-Kilinochchi  backbone \ntransmission line. This will provide a revenue-generating facility to the area, and at the same \ntime will provide urgently needed electricity for hospitals, schools, water supply, and irrigation \nfacilities. It is also considered essential that road improvements be spread throughout the North \nand East and the adjacent districts that contain sections of the same road links, to enable IDPs \nto return and settle, commerce to develop, and links within the area and with the rest of the \n                                                 \n14 As no cofinancing commitment has been made, the Government requested that the study be included under the \nloan. \n   \n ", "10  \ncountry to be quickly restored. The inclusion of the comprehensive study on water supply and \nsanitation systems in the Jaffna Peninsula is crucial, since direct intervention without a proper \nstudy in the very peculiar situation will worsen the already serious public health crisis.  \n \n46.  The community-level infrastructure restoration activities reflect the direct interventions to \nthe communities, particularly IDPs, in resuming their normal life, where subprojects will be \nselected, implemented, and operated by communities, assisted by NGOs, to be used by the \ncommunities. Community ownership of the Project will be built to ensure the sustainability of the \nProject. The user groups will be formed\u2014some of them have already exist\u2014and an agreement \nwill be made for them to contribute in kind or in labor, about 10% of the total rehabilitation costs, \nand to be responsible in operating and maintaining the facilities after completion. Training to \noperate  and  maintain  the  facilities  will  be  provided  as  necessary.  A  close  and  multilevel \nmonitoring mechanism has been established to prevent any abuse of the resources allocated. \nThe Project will engage an appropriate agency, possibly through bilateral assistance, to monitor \nthe impact of the Project on the communities. \n \n47.  The proposed Project is being processed and will be implemented expeditiously. The \nprocedures for processing, procurement, consultant engagement, subproject selection, and the \ntype of works to be done, reflect the flexibility necessary to expedite the assistance without \nsacrificing quality, transparency, and safeguards. However, as the area was a battleground of \nethnic and communal tensions for the last two decades, which destroyed not only physical \nassets but also the human capacity in the area, extra efforts and time are necessary for clearing \nmines,  for  ensuring  community  participation,  proper  targeting  and  adequate  control  and \nmonitoring, and for addressing capacity constraints. Therefore, the Project needs a longer \nimplementation period compared with a more typical rehabilitation after natural disasters project. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n48.  The estimated total cost is $107.9 million equivalent inclusive of taxes, duties, and \ninterest during implementation (Table 1). Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $41.9 million \n(38.8%). Local currency costs are estimated at $66.0 million equivalent (61.2%).  \nTable 1: Cost Estimatesa \n($ million) \nForeign  Local   \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Total \n1.

Financing Plan \n49.  The Government has requested a loan of SDR35,024,000 ($50 million equivalent) from \nADB's Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund [ADF]) and a loan of $30 million from \n  \n \n ", "  11\nADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR).15 The ADF loan will be used to finance parts of road \nrehabilitation, distribution and rural electrification, community restoration and development, full \ncosts of consulting services, and interest during implementation. The OCR loan will be used to \nfinance part of road rehabilitation, power transmission and equipment, and the front-end fee and \ncommitment charge. The Government will meet 25% of the total project cost in local currency, \nincluding taxes, duties, administration expenses, land-related costs, and relocation allowances. \nThe balance, about $0.9 million, represents the beneficiaries' contribution to the Project's direct \ncosts, particularly under Component C. Detailed project costs and financing plan are shown in \nAppendix 7. \n \n50.  The ADF loan will have a 40-year term including a grace period of 10 years, with an \nannual interest rate of 1.0%, with repayment of principal at 2% a year for the first 10 years after \nthe grace period and 4% a year thereafter. For the OCR loan, the interest will be determined in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered (LIBOR)-based lending facility, with a term of \n32 years including a grace period of 8 years, with a  front-end fee of 0.5% (the fee will be \ncapitalized in the loan) and a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decisions to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign Exchange  Local Currency  Total  % \nADB (ADF + OCR)  41.9  38.1  80.0  74.1 \nGovernment *  0.0  27.0  27.0  25.0 \nBeneficiaries (in kind)  0.0  0.9  0.9  0.9 \nTotal  41.9  66.0  107.9  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \n*Including  $13 million for taxes, duties, and land-related costs and relocation allowances. \nSource: Staff estimates. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n51.  The  Project  management  arrangements  described  here  reflect  the  present \nGovernment\u2019s administrative structure in the North and East, and will be likely to change during \nthe project implementation period. The Project\u2019s loan agreement will address this probability by \nreferring to successor entities and arrangements satisfactory to ADB.   \n \n52.  The Ministry of Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government (MHAPCLG), \nunder the oversight of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, will be the coordinating executing agency \n(EA) for the entire Project. For Component A, the EA will be the Ministry of Highways (MOH) \nand  the  implementing  agency  (IA)  will  be  the  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA).    For \nComponent B, the EA will be the Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE) and the IA will be the \nCEB.  For Component C, the EA will be MHAPCLG and the IA will be the North East Provincial \nCouncil (NEPC). For Component D, the EA will be the Ministry of Housing and Plantation \nInfrastructure  (MHPI)  and  the  IA  will  be  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board \n                                                 \n15 The Government requested a $80 million loan from ADF, however, since the available ADF is only $50 million the \nGovernment asked ADB to provide $30 million from OCR to implement the Project. Possible cofinancing is sought \nfor the additional $30 million. Once the cofinancing is committed, the terms of this loan will be adjusted accordingly. \n   \n ", "12  \n(NWSDB).  The Government agreed to provide adequate staff for the coordinating agency and \neach IA, acceptable to ADB, and the associated costs as part of its contribution to the Project. \n \n53.  IAs will be responsible for all activities within their respective components, including staff \nrecruitment, consultant selection and appointment as necessary, subproject identification and \nsubmission  as  applicable,  civil  works  and  other  procurement  as  applicable,  component \nimplementation, funds management, and progress reporting. Existing project management units \n(PMUs)  for  related  ADB-financed  projects,  appropriately  strengthened,  will  assume \nresponsibility for the project activities as follows: (i) Component A: PMU of the Road Network \nImprovement Project (Loan 1649); (ii) Component B: PMU of the Power Sector Development \nProject (Loan 1930); (iii) Component C: PMU of the NECORD Project (Loan 1846); and (iv) \nComponent D: PMU of the Third Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Loan 1575).  \n \n54.  As a condition for the Project loan negotiations, a national project committee has been \nestablished to oversee overall project implementation at the national level. The committee, \nsupported by a small secretariat, will be co-chaired by the secretaries of MHAPCLG and MOH, \nand  will  include  representatives  of  MOPE,  MHPI,  Ministry  of  Policy  Development  and \nImplementation, Commissioner-General of Relief Rehabilitation and Reconciliation, Ministry of \nRelief, Rehabilitation, and Refugees; Ministry of Eastern Development and Muslim Religious \nAffairs;  Ministry  Assisting  Vanni  Rehabilitation;  Ministry  of  Defense  (as  required); \nrepresentatives from IAs; and ADB.  It will meet as required but at least semiannually.   \n \n55.  As a condition for the Project loan negotiations, a project coordination committee (PCC) \nhas been established to coordinate project activities, to manage top-level interaction with the \nLTTE, to ensure proper implementation, and to resolve project-wide implementation issues. The \nPCC,  supported  by  a  small  secretariat,  will  be  chaired  by  the  chief  secretary  of  NEPC, \ncomprising  of  representatives  from  all  IAs  (PMUs)  as  well  as  MHAPCLG,  other  relevant \nagencies, and ADB. As the peace process develops it is anticipated that the LTTE will be \nrepresented, either directly or through one of its agencies, on the PCC. The PCC will meet \nperiodically in Trincomalee, initially not less than once a month and thereafter not less than \nquarterly, to, among other things, review, prioritize, and approve subproject proposals.  The \nPCC secretariat will also be responsible for establishing a management information system \nacceptable  to  ADB  to  track  subprojects  through  their  preparation,  submission,  approval, \nimplementation, and evaluation stages. The system will also be used to monitor the critical \ngeographical and community balances to ensure the Project maximizes benefits for the Project \narea and, equally important, does not contribute to the intercommunal tensions that led to the \nconflict in the first place.    \n \n56.  Because of the scale and complexity of the Project, the likelihood that other similar \nprojects will follow, and the essential need for close coordination with the many involved \nagencies\u2014Government,  LTTE,  external  sources  of  assistance,  international  and  domestic \nNGOs, and others\u2014the responsibility for project administration will be delegated to ADB's Sri \nLanka Resident Mission in Colombo immediately after approval of the Project. The resident \nmission will closely monitor the Project's management of the geographical and community \nbalances, establish effective linkages with all project stakeholders, including the LTTE, and \nensure quality control, speedy implementation, and rapid assistance to the EAs and IAs on \nprocurement and other project implementation matters.  \n  \n2.  Implementation Period \n57.  The Project will be implemented over a 4-year period, reflecting the time required for \nclearance  of  mines  and  unexploded  ordnance,  specification  and  packaging  of  civil  works \n  \n \n ", "  13\ncontracts, community consultation and mobilization, and the approach to implementation by the \nlimited but evolving institutions and capabilities. The disaster that caused the damage lasted for \nmore than 20 years and resulted in the destruction of almost all physical assets in the project \narea. The area is contaminated by mines and unexploded ordnance, which will require time to \nremove. Equally important, the conflict destroyed much of the human capacity in the area, of the \nGovernment, of nonstate actors\u2014not least the LTTE\u2014and the private sector. The Project will \nbegin the essential but time- and resource-consuming task of rebuilding this capacity; for this \nprocess to be effective it should not be rushed. The scheduled completion date is December \n2007, as detailed in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Social and Environmental Measures \n58.  The Project is not expected to require land acquisition or resettlement. Reconstruction \nand  rehabilitation  will  take  place  on  existing  infrastructure  locations.  No  new  roads  or \ntransmission lines will be developed. The works will be designed to ensure that improvements \nwill be within the existing rights-of-way. However, to comply with the ADB's safeguard policy \nrequirement for a sector loan, a resettlement framework,16 as presented in Appendix 9, has \nbeen agreed upon by the Government and ADB to address any possible land acquisition or \ninvoluntary resettlement-related adverse impacts on the Project-affected persons. The fact-\nfinding mission confirmed that there are no encroachers on the land used to rebuild the facilities. \nNo indigenous people will be negatively affected by the Project. The Project will not undertake \nany activities involving the use of land that is the subject of an ownership-related dispute.  \n \n59.  The  Project  is  classified  as  a  category  \u201cB\u201d  project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) because the proposed Project involves only \nrehabilitation of the existing infrastructure. An initial environmental examination (IEE) for sample \nsubprojects is provided in Supplementary Appendix B, which is summarized in Appendix 10. No \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated.  For  subsequent  subprojects  related  to \nnational roads, power transmission lines, and irrigation schemes, IEEs will be required. The \nformat of the IEE is provided in Supplementary Appendix C. For subprojects located within \nareas subject to the Coast Conservation Act No 64 of 1988, the Flora and Fauna Act, and the \nForest Act, ADB will require that applicable environmental clearance is obtained from the \nrelevant project approving agency prior to award of any contracts for that subproject. All \nenvironmental concerns associated with rehabilitation activities as well as anticipated mitigation \nmeasures will be incorporated into contractors\u2019 work assignments. To ensure compliance with \nADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policy and with the Government\u2019s environmental requirements, \nan  environmental  assessment  framework  is  provided  in  Appendix  11  to  guide  the \nimplementation of the Project.  \n \n4.  Selection and Approval of Subprojects \n60.  Subprojects of components A, B, and C will be identified and proposed by the respective \nIAs in accordance with sector-specific criteria agreed upon by the Government and ADB from \ntime to time. In addition, regardless of the sector, each subproject will be proposed on the basis \nof the following general criteria:  \n(i)  The subproject will rehabilitate or reconstruct the conflict-damaged infrastructure, \nand/or directly address the requirements of the conflict-affected people. \n(ii)  The subproject will be identified and prioritized based on the needs assessment \nand will be further selected and designed incorporating beneficiary consultations. \n                                                 \n16 The resettlement framework has been posted in the ADB web site. \n   \n ", "14  \n(iii)  The subproject reflects the requirement for a reasonable balance of activities \namong communities. \n(iv)  The subproject will not be financed by another aid agency, unless the other \nagency and ADB are cofinancing it. \n(v)  The  subproject  must  be  technically  feasible  and  the  least-cost  solution \nalternative, taking into account the need to provide for a reasonable increase in \ndemand in the future. \n(vi)  The equipment, materials, and other resources required can be acquired in, or \ntransported to, the subproject location without unreasonable obstruction or delay. \n(vii)  The subproject can be completed within the project implementation period. \n(viii)  The subproject will not involve any land acquisition or involuntary resettlement, or \nif land acquisition or involuntary resettlement is required, it will be conducted in \nconformity with ADB's  Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and  Handbook on \nResettlement and in accordance with the resettlement framework (Appendix 9). \n(ix)  The  subproject  is  in  compliance  with  the  Government's  environmental \nrequirements,  ADB's  Environmental  Policy,  Environmental  Guidelines  for \nSelected  Infrastructure  Projects  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003) and the agreed environmental assessment framework (Appendix 11). \n \n61.  IAs will prepare subproject proposals in formats agreed upon between the Government \nand ADB during the project inception period. The proposals will be reviewed, prioritized, and \napproved by the PCC during its regular meetings, in which ADB will participate. The subproject \nproposal and approval procedures, reflecting the close and multilevel monitoring mechanism, \nare provided in Appendix 12.   \n \n5.  Procurement of Civil Works and Equipment \n62.  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement, and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to ADB.  As the Project \nis being implemented under the provisions of ADB\u2019s disaster rehabilitation procedures, ADB's \nprocurement guidelines will be flexibly interpreted. For components A and C, which have a wide \ngeographic spread, and because of the security and other frequently-changing matters relevant \nto accessing the project area, and also the small scale of most packages, the works are not \nlikely to attract international contractors and suppliers.  In addition, detailed designs for the \nworks will not be prepared before bidding, rather works will be bid based on simple standard \ndesigns and quantities, to be refined during construction. Therefore, local procurement using \nprocedures acceptable to ADB will be the preferred mode. For Component A, state-owned \nentities will not be eligible to participate in the Project, either as sole contractors, joint venture \npartners, or subcontractors. For Component B, specifically the  transmission line construction \ncontract,  procurement  will  be  undertaken  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB) \nprocedures. \n \n63.  Civil works for components A and C will be packaged in a range of values, to suit the \nvarying capacities of domestic contractors.  Most civil works contracts will be below $2 million \nequivalent, except for a very few that may be in the range of $2 million-$4 million. Contracts with \nestimated  values  equivalent  of  more  than  $4  million  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Contracts with estimated values of more than $1 \nmillion but not more than $4 million will be procured in accordance with local competitive bidding \n(LCB) procedures. Contracts with estimated values of less than $1 million may be procured \n  \n \n ", "  15\neither through LCB or by using special procedures that may include negotiated contracts, \nmanaged labor contracts, community-based contracts,17 or similar arrangements, in accordance \nwith procedures acceptable to ADB. A managed small-scale contractors scheme under a \nsupervision consultant or a management contractor may also be used. Under the ongoing \nNECORD and other projects in the conflict-affected areas (footnotes 4-8), the use of similar \narrangements has proved to be a very effective way to undertake these simple and small-scale \nworks and to build capacity of domestic contractors where little presently exists.  LCB civil works \nprocurement will typically utilize single-stage-two-envelope procedures and bidding periods of \nnot less than 21 days.18 For the ICB contracts, a single-stage-two-envelopes bidding procedure \nwill be applied with a bid submission period of 45 days. \n \n64.  Equipment and materials valued at more than $0.5 million equivalent will be procured \nunder ICB, valued from  $0.3 million to $0.5 million equivalent by international shopping, and \nvalued less than $0.3 million equivalent by local procedures acceptable to ADB. Specific \napproval from the Government will be required for vehicle procurement. For Component B, \nCEB's standard LCB procedures acceptable to ADB may be used for manufacture of aluminum \nconductors and procurement of concrete poles, line hardware, and accessories.  \n \n65.  The  standard  bidding  documents  approved  by  ADB  under  the  Road  Network \nImprovement Project (Loan 1649), the Power Sector Development Project (Loan 1930), and \nNECORD Project (Loan 1846) will be adopted for subprojects, subject to a one-time review by \nADB to ensure that they remain current with ADB requirements. ADB's approval will be required \nfor all civil works and supply contracts valued at more than $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, \nprior to award of the respective contracts. For contracts valued at less than these amounts, the \nfirst three contract packages of each component will also be subject to ADB review and \napproval; and for subsequent contracts, ADB post-facto approvals will be applied. However, if \nADB does not approve the award or terms of any such contract, the Government will not use \nloan proceeds to finance such contract, and in the event that loan proceeds are used to finance \nsuch contract, the Government will refund to ADB any such payment. Independent procurement \naudit, if required, is provided for in the Project costs. \n \n66.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval of advance action for procurement of \ncivil works, including inviting and receiving bids for contracts up to the stage of ADB's approval \nof the EA's recommendation for award of contract before the date of loan effectiveness. The \nGovernment has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance action would not commit ADB to \nfinancing the Project or the procurement costs. \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n67.  Consulting services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Reflecting the need to commence project activities quickly under ADB\u2019s procedures \nfor disaster rehabilitation loans (footnote 2), the following arrangements will be implemented.  \n \n68.  For Component A, RDA will select the consultant from among the existing consultants \nalready  engaged  in  ongoing  ADB-financed road sector projects in Sri Lanka,19 subject to \n                                                 \n17 ADB's Project Administration Instruction 3.05 will be used for reference during implementation. \n18  The LTTE has requested that people within the area be able to participate in projects to improve their living \nconditions and capacity. Under NECORD, training is provided to about 400 local people in basic construction skills. \n19 ADB. 1994.

The period for the proposals will be 45 days, and the evaluation will \nbe done under quality-and-cost-based selection method. No consultant will be required for \nComponent B. For Component C and overall project coordination, direct negotiation will be \ncarried  out  with  the  existing  consultant  for  the  NECORD  project,  subject  to  satisfactory \nperformance. For Component D, full technical proposals will be invited from the short-list of \nconsultants that passed the technical qualifications approved by ADB for the Secondary Towns \nWater Supply and Sanitation Project (footnote 8), using the quality-and-cost-based-selection \nmethod.  \n \n69.  Consultant inputs are estimated to be as follows:  (i) for Component A, 72 and 1078 \nperson-months international and domestic consultant inputs, respectively, and the associated \ncosts will be about $4.1 million; (ii) for Component B, no consultant inputs; (iii) for Component C, \n250 person-months of domestic consultant inputs, with the estimated costs of about $0.7 million; \n(iv) for Component D, 30 and 100 person-months international and domestic consultant inputs, \nrespectively,  with  the  estimated  cost  of  about  $1.2  million;  and  (v)  for  overall  project \ncoordination and monitoring, 140 person-months of domestic consultant inputs with estimated \ncosts of about $0.5 million (Appendix 13).  \n \n70.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval of advance action for recruitment of \nconsultants,  including  preparing  and  negotiating  variations  to  existing  consulting  services \ncontracts. The Government has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance recruitment \naction would not commit ADB to financing the Project or the recruitment costs.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n71.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as \namended from time to time, and detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB.  For \ncomponent D, disbursement will be through direct payment procedures. \n \n72.  For Component A, two imprest accounts, one for ADF loan and one for OCR loan, will \nbe established at the Central Bank for RDA for use in procurement of civil works and equipment. \nThe initial amount to be deposited into the imprest account will not exceed the equivalent of 6 \nmonths\u2019  estimated  expenditure,  or  $2  million  for  ADF  loan  and  $1  million  for  OCR  loan, \nwhichever is less. Consulting services will be procured utilizing direct payment procedures.  \n \n73.  For component B, an imprest account for ADF loan be established at the Central Bank \nfor CEB for use in procurement of civil works and equipment. The initial amount to be deposited \ninto the imprest account will not exceed the equivalent of 6 months\u2019 estimated expenditure, or \n$500,000, whichever is less. For the OCR-financed of the component B, disbursement will be \nthrough direct payment or commitment letter procedures.  \n \n74.  For Component C, an imprest account will be established at the Central Bank with \nMHAPCLG, which in turn will fund a second generation imprest account (SGIA) at the project \nlevel with NEPC.  The initial amount to be deposited into these imprest accounts will not exceed \nthe  equivalent  of  6  months\u2019  estimated  expenditure,  or  $800,000,  whichever  is  less.  Third \ngeneration imprest accounts (TGIAs) will be established by NEPC at banks to be agreed by the \nGovernment and ADB for each district. The initial amount to be deposited into each TGIA will \nnot exceed the equivalent of 6 months\u2019 estimated expenditure, or $100,000, whichever is less. \nThe SGIA and TGIAs are necessary as the implementation of Component C will be in provincial \nand district levels. Both MHAPCLG and NEPC have experience with operation of the imprest \naccounts under the previous ADB-funded NECORD project, and have adequate accounting and \n  \n \n ", "  17\ninternal controls over the SGIA and TGIAs. Each TGIA will be established only after ADB is \nsatisfied with the accounting capabilities for that account. \n \n75.  The imprest accounts, SGIA, and TGIAs will be established, managed, and liquidated in \naccordance with the ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed \nto  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  Statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to \nreimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances made into the imprest accounts, \nSGIA, and TGIAs. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under statement of \nexpenditure procedures will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000.   \n \n8.  Project Performance Management System \na.   Accounts and Audit \n76.  The IAs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the financing \nresources received and expenditures made on the Project, including the goods, works, and \nservices financed out of the loan proceeds and out of local funds. These project accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards by auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will submit annual audited reports \nand related financial statements to ADB within 12 months after the end of each fiscal year. The \naudit of imprest accounts, SGIA, TGIAs, and statements of expenditure will be carried out as \npart of the annual audit, with the auditor\u2019s opinion of that part to be separately set out in the \nauditor\u2019s report. Independent audit, if required, is provided for in the project costs. \n \n    b.  Reports \n \n77.  Each IA, through PCC, will submit to ADB monthly reports on the implementation of the \nrespective component. The reports indicate, among other things, progress made and problems \nencountered during the review period, remedial steps taken or to be taken, and proposed \nprogram activities of the following 3 months. Based on these reports, the secretariat of the PCC \nwill develop a web-based management information and reporting system, through which the \nGovernment, ADB, and other interested parties can routinely monitor and review project status, \nincluding procurement and disbursement activities, community participation and balances, and \nmajor issues and problems, etc, will be decided between the Government and ADB during the \nproject inception period and will include at least end-of-month financial and physical progress \nreports within 1 week of the end of the month to which they relate.  \n \n78.  Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will furnish to \nADB a project completion report providing a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, \ncontractors\u2019 and consultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, and other details as \nmay be requested by ADB.  \n \n    c.  Project Performance Management System \n \n79.  A performance monitoring system will be established in accordance with ADB's Project \nPerformance Management System Handbook, based on the key indicators and targets outlined \nin the project framework. For Component A the baseline will be the existing roughness (based \non visual assessment) and traffic levels. For Component B, the baseline will be the connectivity \nto the rural electric system. For Component C, the baseline will be the socioeconomic condition \nof the project beneficiaries. Benchmark surveys will be conducted before project implementation \n   \n ", "18  \nfor monitoring purposes as well as for checking against selection criteria.20 An NGO will be \nengaged, under the PCC consultant, to monitor the impact of the Project to the communities. \nd.  Project Review \n80.  In addition to regular reviews by Sri Lanka Resident Mission staff and participation by \nsuch staff in the PCC meetings, a detailed midterm review of the Project will be carried out \naround December 2005. The Government will submit to ADB a detailed progress report on the \nimplementation and achievements of the Project. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n81.  The conflict-affected areas experience poverty levels, estimated to range from 60% to \n90%, which are much higher than the rest of the country. The needs assessment demonstrated \nthat little economic or social infrastructure remains intact, and what is present has long passed \nits useful life. Until this infrastructure is restored, it will not be possible for communities in the \nareas to restore their livelihoods, even at a very basic level, and begin the long process of \ncatching up with the development that has been available to the rest of the country for the past \ntwo decades. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is provided in Appendix 14. \n \n82.  The Project will address urgent needs of the almost 2 million conflict-affected people in \nthe  project  area.  Many  are  physically  disabled  people,  women-headed  households,  and \nchildren. These people are now beginning to rebuild their lives in an area that has been either \ndevastated by conflict or suffered through many years of neglect. In particular, the beneficiaries \nwill be communities served by the Project's roads, the electricity, and the small-scale activities \nundertaken under the community restoration and development component. They will benefit \nfrom improved infrastructure, giving them improved access to economic opportunities and social \nservices, and reducing their isolation from other parts of the country. Where appropriate, \nprimarily for components A and C, the works will be designed to be within the capabilities and \nresources  of  domestic  contractors  and  community-based  organizations.  This  will  provide \ndomestic contractors and local communities with the opportunities to develop their capacity to \nundertake works of this nature, and begin the process of developing a functioning economy in \nthe area that has been largely reduced to relying on subsistence support from the Government. \n \n83.  Road rehabilitation will greatly contribute to and underpin improvements in the living \nconditions of people, including resettling populations and other vulnerable groups. It will provide \naccess to vital services and support renewed economic and development-oriented activities that \nwill in turn enhance people's livelihoods in the longer term. \n \n84.  The Project focuses on restoring pre-existing facilities with appropriate provision for \ntechnical improvement and future demand, based on a least-cost approach. The existing traffic, \nas in any other war-torn areas, has been low or nonexistent for long periods. While undertaking \na detailed economic analysis would not produce a reliable result, subproject proposals will \ninclude a traffic study and a basic economic analysis, as baseline information for subsequent \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation. Observations on roads that have been opened since the \nceasefire agreement, in particular the A9 highway from Vavuniya to Jaffna, indicate that traffic \nrapidly builds up to a reasonable level. Progressive extension of opening hours and reduction of \n                                                 \n20 ADB is also preparing technical assistance, financed by the Government of the Netherlands, to conduct poverty \nassessment and information management in Sri Lanka including the conflict-affected areas. \n  \n \n ", "  19\nformalities will result in further increases in traffic volumes. Therefore, the impacts of the road \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  component  are  expected  to  be  improved  accessibility  and \nreduced isolation of the project areas. The travel time and vehicle operating costs will be \nreduced, which will in turn result in greater availability of transport services, lower agricultural \ninput costs, and higher agricultural output prices.  \n \n85.  Electricity growth has a direct bearing on the gross domestic product growth of Sri \nLanka. The Project will restore the supply of power to the conflict-affected area, with its \nattendant economic and social benefits, thereby beginning to narrow the gap in access to power \nbetween the areas and the remainder of the country. The beneficiaries of power rehabilitation \nare industry, fishery, agriculture, livestock production, housing, education, health, water supply, \nand irrigation. It will benefit the whole population and improve living standards.  \n \n86.  The Project will assist with stabilizing the economic basis of those affected by the \nconflict,  reducing  dependencies  on  Government  support,  and  supporting  the  affected \ncommunities  in  restoring  a  sustainable  livelihood.  Under  the  Project,  communities\u2014both \nreturned IDPs and people who remained behind\u2014select activities that will benefit the entire \ncommunity and implement the activities with the assistance of NGOs funded through the \nProject. Through peace-building activities like strengthening of village-based mechanisms for \nconflict resolution, people will learn to better define and implement nonviolent responses to \nconflict,  thus  contributing  to  a  more  harmonious  social  climate.  The  Project  will  use \nmethodologies  conducive  to  community  participation,  local  capacity  building,  provision  of \nemployment, and the provision of venues for those wishing to share their experiences. This will \nsupport the local communities' sense of ownership, instill trust and self-confidence, and assist in \nthe mental healing process.  \n \nB.  Peace and Conflict Risks \n87.  The peace and conflict impact assessment is provided in Appendix 15. On condition that \nthe beneficial outcomes are shared equitably among the major ethnic groups and across the \ntarget area, the Project is not expected to contribute to an intensification of social tensions. The \nsmall scale, local nature of Component C activities appears to make them unlikely to be \ncaptured by elite or sectarian interests. Through  this component,  the Project can potentially \nmake a positive contribution to the rebuilding of the infrastructure and socioeconomic fabric of \nthe conflict-affected areas. The challenge will be in implementing Component C in a sensitive \nmanner, i.e., ensuring that: \n(i)  districts and communities are selected in ways that ensure an ethnic balance that \nreasonably reflects the general ethnic composition of the area; \n(ii)  rigorous  measures  are  applied  to  limit  the  potential  of  corruption  diverting \nresources to local, subnational, and national elites; \n(iii)  all activities are characterized by transparency, so that the relevant stakeholders \nunderstand the project criteria and how the Project is progressing; \n(iv)  peace-building activities are designed and implemented in ways that make the \ncommunities more resilient to pressures that might otherwise lead to violence; \n(v)  implementation is done using local resources to the extent possible, encouraging \na sense of ownership of the dividends flowing from the ceasefire. \n \n   \n ", "20  \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \nA.  Specific Assurances \n88.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  The  Project  management  arrangements  reflect  the  present  Government \nadministrative  structure  in  the  North  and  East  that  may  change  during \nimplementation. The Government will immediately notify ADB of any proposed \nchange in the administrative structure in the project areas, and take all steps \nnecessary to ensure that the project management arrangements are revised in \nconsultation with ADB to reflect the new administrative structure and protect the \nviability of the Project.  The Government will take all steps necessary and within \nits power to ensure than any successor project management entities enter into \nsuch project or other agreements with ADB as ADB may request.  \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that all project interventions contribute to peace \nbuilding and community reconciliation. In the event that any intervention is having \nor is thought to have negative impact on peace building and reconciliation efforts, \nthe Government agrees that ADB will have the discretion to determine whether \nthe intervention should be continued, redesigned, suspended, or cancelled.  \n(iii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  staff,  consultants,  materials,  vehicles, \nequipment and other items required for project implementation will be given \nreasonable access to the project area.   \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that adequate counterpart funds are made available \nto the Project when and in the amount required to enable the IAs to discharge \ntheir responsibilities under the Project. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the facilities provided under the Project are \noperated and maintained appropriately, and that adequate budgetary and other \nresources will be provided for this purpose. The Government will also ensure that \ncommunity-based organizations charged with operating and maintaining facilities \nprovided under the Project are provided with the support and training required to \nundertake these activities. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that adequate environmental mitigation measures, \nin accordance with (i) the Government\u2019s environmental regulations and (ii) ADB's \nEnvironment Policy (2002), Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure \nProjects and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), are incorporated into \nall subproject designs and implementation.  The Government will ensure that the \nagreed  environmental  assessment  framework  is  implemented;  that  all \nsubprojects for which an IEE is required include such IEE in the subproject \nproposal; and that all subprojects for which the Government\u2019s environmental \nclearance is required obtain such clearance prior to the award of any contracts \nfor that subproject. \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that, to the extent possible, subprojects will not \nrequire  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.    In  the  event  that  land \nacquisition and/or involuntary resettlement are required for any subproject, then \n  \n \n ", "  21\nthe Government will prepare a resettlement plan in accordance with the its own \napplicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(1995), ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement:  A Guide to Good Practice (1998), \nand the resettlement framework, and submit it to ADB for review and approval \nbefore any land acquisition is initiated.   \n(viii)  The  Government  and  each  IA  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  meet,  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB,  the  agreed  selection  criteria  and  implementation \narrangements. \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that in the event that CEB is reorganized, before \nany successor entity or entities becomes an IA under the Project, the new \ncompanies shall enter into agreements with ADB with respect to their rights and \nobligations under the Project.

Objectives and Scope \n \n1.  The primary objective of Component A is to provide a reliable transport network in the \nconflict-affected areas.  The rehabilitation of strategic road links throughout the region will help \nprovide an enabling environment to promote economic growth and community development.  \nRehabilitation will consist of low-cost intermediate interventions to bring the deteriorated roads \nup to an all-weather standard of maintainable condition.  The Project will also provide for \ncapacity building of the nascent construction industry in the conflict-affected areas.  \n \n2.  The scope of Component A includes (i) reconstruction of about 500 kilometers (km) of \nnational  roads;  (ii)  replacement  of  small,  damaged  roadway  bridges;  and  (iii)  mine  and \nunexploded ordnance clearance along project roadways. The candidate roads are listed in \nTable A3.1.  \n \nTable A3.1: Indicative Roads Requiring Immediate Rehabilitation \nRoad  Length  Estimated Cost \n(km)  ($ million) \nPriority 1 Road Links     \n   A-9:    Kandy \u2013 Jaffna (Medawachchiya - Vavuniya,   55  4.2 \n              167-    176 and km 290 \u2013 km 320)     \n  A-35:  Paranthan \u2013 Mullaitivu  52  4.0 \nB-357:  Paranthan \u2013 Poonakary  26  2.1 \nB-424:  Trincomalee \u2013 Kuchchaveli - Pulmoddai  55  4.2 \n  A-12:  Trincomalee \u2013 Harowpathana  30  2.4 \n  A-34:  Mankulam\u2013 Mullaitivu  49  3.8 \nB-269:  Velankulam \u2013 Mankulam  38  3.0 \n  A-32:  Poonakary \u2013 Mannar  85  6.5 \n  A-29:  Harowpathana \u2013 Vavuniya  46  3.6 \nB-296:  Puliyankulam \u2013 Mullaitivu  32  2.5 \n    A-4:  Siyambalanduwa \u2013 Pottuvil  30  2.4 \nB-374:  Pottuvil \u2013 Panama  20  1.6 \n            Subtotal Priority 1 Roads  518  40.3 \nPriority 2 Road Links (Subject to Funding)     \nB-297:  Mullaitvu\u2013 Pulmoddai  45  3.4 \n    A-5:  Maha Oya \u2013 Chenkaladi  45  3.4 \n  A-14:  Thalaimannar \u2013 Paraiyanankulam  80  6.0 \n  A-30:  Paraiyanankulam \u2013 Vavuniya  36  2.7 \n            Subtotal Priority 2 Roads  206  15.5 \nTotal National Roads  724  55.8 \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: The Needs Assessment Report and Saff estimates. \n \n3.  The length of roads requiring rehabilitation and the estimated costs associated exceed \nthe available funding; therefore the project roads will be selected during implementation based \non the general criteria of the subprojects and the following sector-specific criteria:  \n \n(i)  the overall network must provide connectivity throughout the region; ", "  Appendix 3  25 \n(ii)  all district headquarters must be connected to the network; \n(iii)  the selected roads are important links for transporting fisheries, agricultural, and \nlivestock products; \n(iv)  the roads will facilitate resettlement of internally displaced persons, improve \ncommunication links, and reduce travel times and costs; and \n(v)  consultations  with  stakeholders  will  be  taken  into  account  in  selecting  and \nprioritizing the project roads.   \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n4.  The Road Development Authority (RDA) under the Ministry of Highways will be the \nImplementing  Agency.  The  existing  project  management  unit  (PMU)  within  the  RDA  now \nadministering  the  ongoing  Asian  Development  Bank-funded  Road  Network  Improvement \nProject1 will be strengthened to also implement the road infrastructure component of the Project.  \nA team of international and domestic consultants will be engaged to assist the PMU and RDA in \n(i) road selection, (ii) road design, (iii) cost estimates and bidding documents, (iv) procurement \nprocessing, (v) construction supervision, (vi) the contractor mentoring program, and (vii) survey \nand clearance of unexploded ordnance.   \n \nC.  Outline Terms of Reference \n \n5.  The component will, through low-cost intermediate interventions, restore project road \nsections to an all-weather standard of maintainable condition. Rehabilitation of small bridges \nwithin the length of  subproject roads may also be required. The works will be grouped into \nvarious contract sizes and will be procured using local competitive bidding procedures.   \n \n6.  A team of international and domestic consultants will be required to (i) evaluate and \nrecommend road subprojects, (ii) develop contract packages and prepare corresponding cost \nestimates and bid documents similar to the simple format documents prepared for the ongoing \nA9 highway improvement, (iii) provide procurement assistance, (iv) conduct surveys for and \nclearance of mines and unexploded ordnance within subproject rights-of-way, (v) monitor and \nsupervise construction activities, (vi) provide technical guidance to the PMU as necessary \nduring implementation, (vii) assess availability of materials within project areas and locate or \nidentify materials sources, (viii) develop low-cost soil stabilization construction measures for \nroad improvements in poor soil areas, (ix) assist in maintaining project data records, monitor \nprogress and submit progress reports, and (x) conduct benefit monitoring surveys.   \n \n7.  The consultant will also assist small, domestic contractors during the Project through a \ncontractor-mentoring  program.  Utilizing  a  managed-contract  construction  scheme,  a \nrepresentative from a large domestic contractor will serve as consultant to the Project by \nbreaking one or more subprojects into smaller packages more suitable to the capacity of the \nexisting domestic contractors.  The contractor-consultant will prepare the contract packages and \nassist the contractors throughout construction with planning and implementing the works.   \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

Rationale \n \n1.  Electricity growth has a direct bearing on the growth of gross domestic product in Sri \nLanka. The beneficiaries of power sector rehabilitation and improvements will include industry, \nfishing,  agriculture,  livestock  production,  housing,  education,  water,  and  irrigation.  The \nreconstruction of the north-south transmission line and the grids will benefit the population of the \nProject area and lead to the improvement of living standards.  Further, electricity will be the \nbasis on which resettlement can become an attractive option and thus migration of internally \ndisplaced persons to urban areas will be lessened. \nB.  Objective and Scope \n2.  The objectives of this component of the proposed Project are to (i) restore services to a \nuseable and maintainable condition to meet the demands of the returning populations; and (ii) \nensure that the services, once restored, are affordable, financially and technically sustainable, \nand maintained. \nC.  Components and Outputs \n1.  Conceptual Framework \n3.  In electricity grids, generation, transmission, and distribution go hand in hand with each \nother.  Restoration in just one of these components would not address the effectiveness of the \noverall system. To this end, the objective is to restore a complete and functional electricity grid \nin the northeast. Due to the conflict, the transmission system is scattered at best, with total \ndamage in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, and Mullaitivu districts. The transmission backbone needs to be \nrehabilitated from Anuradhapura to Jaffna.  In parallel, the distribution network, threading from \nthe main transmission line, also needs to be repaired.  Most importantly, generation capacity\u2014\nwhether it is from connection to the national grid or regionally generated\u2014will need to be re-\ninstalled to be able to utilize the transmission and distribution networks. \n2.  Generation \n4.  The supply of power comes from interconnection with the national grid and is supported \nby generation within the region. Connectivity with the national grid can only come after the \ntransmission backbone is restored; therefore, as an immediate action the Ceylon Electricity \nBoard (CEB) will re-installed power generation of 2 megawatts in Kilinochchi. The effectiveness \nof  the  Kilinochchi  distribution  component  of  the  emergency  facility  is  dependent  on  the \nKilinochchi power generation station. \n3.  Transmission \n5.  The transmission backbone comprises of three major segments: Jaffna to Kilinochchi \n(132 kilovolts [kV]), Vavuniya to Kilinochchi (132 kV), and Anuradhapura to Vavuniya (132 kV). \nThe replacement of the damaged transmission line in the first two segments\u2014from Jaffna to \nKilinochchi and from Vavuniya to Kilinochchi\u2014has to be given priority.  It is envisaged that the \ntransmission line between Anuradhapura and Vavuniya should be augmented to a 220 kV line. ", "28  Appendix 4   \n6.  It is indicated that a bilateral funding agency is considering funding the transmission line \nand grid substations between Jaffna and Kilinochchi, which leaves the restoration of the power \ntransmission  system  between  Vavuniya  and  Kilinochchi  as  the  main  target  for  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) intervention. \n4.  Distribution and Rural Electrification \n7.  As  a  result  of  the  prolonged  conflict,  the  districts  of  the  north  have  the  lowest \nelectrification ratio compared to other areas in the country. Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi districts \nhave totally nonfunctional electricity.  After surveying the districts in both the Northern and the \nEastern provinces, it is deemed necessary to re-establish the distribution network covering all \ndistricts in them. Since the electricity system in districts like Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi are \npractically destroyed, a significant portion of the funds will go into the restoration of distribution \nand rural networks between Elephant Pass and the North Central Province. \nD.  Implementing Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n8.  CEB, or its successor entities as per prior agreement with ADB, will implement the  \npower component. CEB's general manager and additional general manager (distribution and \noperations),  or  the  management  of  the  successor  companies,  will  supervise  the  project \nmanagers and teams who will implement CEB's rural electrification and 33 kV distribution \nsubcomponents. CEB's general manager and additional general manager (transmission), or the \nmanagement of the successor companies, will supervise the project managers and teams who \nwill implement CEB's transmission subproject. Before implementation, these groups from CEB \nwill prepare proposals for all subprojects for ADB\u2019s review and approval. As per prior agreement \nwith ADB, the same implementation arrangements will be established to ensure successful \nproject implementation by CEB's successor entities. \n2.  Period of Implementation \n9.  Implementation of the Project will begin in January 2004 and be completed in December \n2007. CEB will be responsible for directly supervising implementation and monitoring of the \noperational performance of the component B, and will submit progress reports regularly as \nagreed for ADB review. ADB will also monitor the overall financial and technical performance of \nthe power sector in relation to the Government's fiscal position. \n3.  Procurement \n10.  Goods and services financed by ADB will be procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. For such procurement, bid specifications will be prepared in a manner as to \nensure maximum competition under international competitive bidding procedures. Each supply \ncontract estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of \ninternational competitive bidding. Each contract estimated to cost less than the equivalent of \n$500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping.  CEB\u2019s  standard  local \ncompetitive bidding procedure may be used for the manufacture of aluminum conductors and \nprocurement of concrete poles, line hardware, and accessories. The CEB successor companies \nwill also follow ADB's Guidelines for Procurement in procuring goods and services financed by \nthe Project.  ", "Appendix 5  29 \nCOMPONENT C: COMMUNITY RESTORATION AND DEVELOPMENT \n \nA.  Water Supply, Sanitation, and Irrigation \n \n1.  The  scope  of  the  water  supply  subcomponent  is  (i)  rehabilitation  of  water  supply \nschemes in total disrepair, (ii) provision of bowsers and plastic holding tanks, (iii) replacement of \ndestroyed truck and tractor trailer mounted bowsers to be used for provision of drinking water \nespecially  in  areas  where  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs)  are  returning,  (iv) \nrepair/replacement of generator sets to provide uninterrupted electricity supplies to run existing \nwater supply facilities, and (v) repair of hand pump tube wells and dug wells to serve families. \nThe scope of the sanitation subcomponent will include rehabilitation of sanitation facilities to \nhouseholds, schools, and medical facilities. The scope of the irrigation subcomponent will \ninclude rehabilitation of existing medium and small irrigation schemes. The works will include \nrehabilitation  of  tank  bunds,  channel  system,  access  roads,  and  other  structures.  This \nsubcomponent will also include the rehabilitation of the barrages in the Jaffna Peninsula that is \nnot being financed by other sources. \n \n2.  Selection criteria for water supply and sanitation subprojects will be as follows: \n \n(i)  The  number  of  connections  should  not  exceed  500  and  agreement  for \nmanagement  of  the  scheme  by  the  respective  local  authority  and/or  a \ncommunity-based organization (CBO). \n(ii)  For  water  supply  systems,  the  numbers  of  families  to  be  served  for  each \ninstallation should be consistent with national policies. For wells, at least 20-25 \nfamilies should benefit from one well, consistent with national policy standards.  \n(iii)  For sanitation facilities also, the number of families to be served should be \nconsistent with national policy standards. \n(iv)  Potable water source is not available within a radius of 500 meters. \n(v)  Water Resources Board and/or the National Water Supply and Drainage Board \nhave carried out preliminary investigations, and have certified that potable water \nof sufficient quantity and quality is available, and the abstraction of water would \nnot create adverse impacts to existing water users or the groundwater table, in \nboth the short and long term. \n(vi)  For tubewells, beneficiary communities have agreed to contribute labor and other \nmaterials  in  kind  for  the  installation  of  hand  pumps  and  construction  of \nbasements, together estimated to be about 5-10% of the total cost of civil and \nmechanical works for a typical tubewell.  \n(vii)  For open dugwells, beneficiary communities have agreed to voluntarily contribute \nin kind or labor about 10% of the total cost of civil works.  \n(viii)  For sanitation facilities, beneficiaries have also agreed to voluntarily contribute \nthe labor required for construction of the civil works.  \n(ix)  Beneficiaries  have  agreed  to  maintain  the  wells,  and  have  formed  a  water \nmanagement organization for this purpose.  \n(x)  The community, especially women, have agreed to the location of the wells.  \n(xi)  No land acquisition to construct the wells is required.  ", "30  Appendix 5 \n(xii)  Where the location of a well on privately owned land is unavoidable, a written and \nlegally valid assurance from the landholder must be available allowing permanent \naccess of other beneficiaries to the well.  \n(xiii)  Total cost is below SLRs120,000 for a single tubewell and SLRs150,000 for an \nopen dugwell, and the number of wells provided in any village is limited to three. \n \n3.  Selection criteria for irrigation subcomponents will be as follows: \n \n(i)  There must be a clear benefit, in economic terms, arising from the rehabilitation \nwork,  which  will  typically  be  limited  to  activities  on  canals  and  distribution \nsystems, and will not include major work on tanks and headworks. \n(ii)  The expenditure for rehabilitation works will not exceed $700 equivalent per \nhectare of the command area affected by the works. \n(iii)  The schemes should be those where a significant proportion IDPs are now \nreturning to their land, and require the rehabilitation work to proceed to restore \ntheir previous livelihoods.  \n(iv)  Land ownership is clearly defined.  \n(v)  The rehabilitation required is not simply the  result of maintenance not done, \nexcept where the scheme has been inaccessible due to security reasons. \n(vi)  Large-scale  capital  works  will  not  be  included;  preference  will  be  given  to \nschemes where relatively low-cost labor-intensive works on downstream canals \nand farm access works are required. \n(vii)  Rehabilitation of the main barrages in Jaffna Peninsula should be in coordination \nwith  the  proposed  study  and  should  only  include  the  ones  that  will  not  be \nfinanced by other sources. \n \n4.

The water supply and sanitation subcomponent is to \nbe implemented to the extent possible through the existing government structure and agencies, \nwith  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  providing  assistance  and  coordination  where \nappropriate and required. For water supply schemes, procurement of major equipment items will \nbe implemented by relevant line agencies. Health and sanitary education will be provided by the \nMinistry of Health. Water supply and sanitation activities for schools will be undertaken by the \nProvincial Education Ministry, as part of the education subcomponent of the Project. School \ndevelopment societies could also contribute to this activity. Improvements to water supply and \nsanitation systems in communities will be carried out through the respective government agents. \nAt the local level, water supply and sanitation activities will be undertaken, and the resulting \nsystems  maintained,  by  user  groups  or  CBOs.  These  organizations  will  be  assisted  by \ngovernment agencies and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) as appropriate. Procurement \nrelating  to  civil  works,  equipment,  services,  and  the  use  of  CBOs  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with the procedures as agreed in the loan agreement. \n \n5.  The irrigation subcomponent is to be implemented by the Provincial Department of \nIrrigation for the medium to minor schemes and by National Irrigation Department for major \ntanks, with the PMU providing assistance and coordination where appropriate and required. \nCoordination with the user groups and CBOs should be ensured in the implementation of any \nrehabilitation works of the channel networks. Procurement relating to civil works will be carried \nout in accordance with the procedures as agreed in the loan agreement.  \n ", "Appendix 5  31 \nB.  Education \n \n6.

Wherever  possible,  the  works  will  be  executed  through  contracts  with  domestic \ncontractors. Where this is not possible, the works could be carried out through government \nagencies,  community-based  organizations,  etc.  using  a  labor-based  equipment  supported \ntechnology approach. \n12.  Detailed selection criteria will be developed during the project inception period, based \nlargely on the following: \n \n(i)  Only road classes C, D, and rural, are to be included, subject to there being \nsufficient traffic to justify rehabilitation. \n(ii)  Priority is to be given to roads serving agricultural or fisheries activities that link \nvillages and relocation schemes included in the project scope to nearby market \ncenters and townships, as identified by the communities and included in village \ndevelopment plans. \n(iii)  Roads  that  provide  access  to  protected  areas,  such  as  wildlife  reserves, \ncontrolled forests, etc, are not to be included. \n(iv)  Roads to be improved should benefit a substantial proportion of population. ", "Appendix 5  33 \n(v)  The scope of the activity of road repairs is limited to existing road alignments, \nwhere no land acquisition is required, except for internal and access roads for \nrelocation villages. \n(vi)  More  than  90%  of  beneficiary  families  have  agreed  to  participate  in  the \nconstruction and to carry out maintenance after rehabilitation. \n(vii)  Beneficiaries are willing to contribute in kind, or in labor, about 10% of the total \nvalue of the civil works cost. The beneficiaries will ensure that the burden of this \ncontribution does not fall on the poorest members of the community. \n(viii)  The security forces have agreed that the road can be improved. \n(ix)  The estimated base cost, at 2003 prices, should be less than SLRs500,000 per \nkilometer. \n(x)  Confirmation is to be available that the beneficiaries are the original landowners, \nor occupiers, and not new settlers. \n(xi)  Availability of a disaggregated civil works cost estimate showing the works items \nthat would be completed by the beneficiaries, in lieu of their voluntary share. \n(xii)  A  written  agreement  from  the  community  accepting  the  responsibility  for \nmaintenance of the road is available. \nE.  Small-Scale Renewable Energy \n \n13.  The renewable energy subcomponent will be implemented in isolated rural communities \nwhere improvement of the existing interconnection does not prove to be cost effective.  Small-\nscale  renewable  energy  schemes  will  be  provided  in  16  villages  on  a  pilot  basis.    The \nsubcomponent will be implemented with the participation of the community and also maintained \nby the community or the user groups. The subproject selection criteria will be as follows: \n \n(i)  Priority will be given to remote villages or where IDPs are returning. \n(ii)  The appropriate technology will be selected based on an initial assessment of \npotential sources and that will meet supply demand.  \n(iii)  The user groups will be formed by the community and agreeable to pay portion of \nthe initial cost. \n(iv)  Where user groups are willing to pay a tariff on the metered consumption on a \nmonthly basis or as agreed during the implemented. The tariff should at least \nrecover the operation and maintenance cost of the system.  \n(v)  CBOs  or  appropriate  user  groups  are  willing  to  sign  for  operation  and \nmaintenance of the system with the supplier or an appropriate organization that \nprovide technical assistance. \n(vi)  The user group is willing to store any parts that are hazardous to the environment \nand return them back to the supplier or the appropriate organization that revives \nor safely disposes of such items.   \n \n14.  Implementation  Arrangements.  This  component  will  implemented  by  the  PMU  in \ncoordination  with  the  government  agent,  CBOs,  and  NGOs.    Procurement  of  goods  and \nservices will follow the procedures set out in the project loan agreement.  ", "34  Appendix 5 \nF.  Community Livelihood Restoration \n \n15.  The objective of this livelihood restoration subcomponent is to improve the well-being \nand stabilize the income of the conflict-affected village populations by (i) satisfying immediate \nbasic needs of the most vulnerable households, complementing the Government\u2019s efforts under \nthe Unified Assistance Scheme; and (ii) restoring community-level small infrastructures. The \ntarget beneficiaries will be from communities containing significant proportions of IDPs, female-\nheaded households, youth and children in the divisions worst affected by the conflict. The \nproposed assistance will not exclude original occupants.  \n \n16.  This  subcomponent  comprises  (i)  household  level  interventions  and  re-creation of \nassets,  and  (ii)  community-focused  reconstruction  and  restoration.  The  household  level \ninterventions  will  be  specifically  aimed  at  the  most  disadvantaged  groups  within  the \ncommunities  and  include,  depending  on  the  needs  identified  during  implementation,  the \nprovision of small livestock, energy-saving stoves, biogas or other alternative energy sources for \nthe household level, as well as skills development needed in conjunction with the restoration, \noperation  and  maintenance  of  the  household  level  infrastructure.  In  addition,  other  micro-\nenterprises will be facilitated through skills training (e.g. for para-veterinarians, agroprocessing, \nor  small  business  management).  The  preparation  and  dissemination  of  available  training \nmaterial, brochures, and documents will be in all three languages of the country.  \n \n17.  The community-focused reconstruction and restoration will include storage facilities, \nreconstruction  of  community  multipurpose  halls,  libraries,  markets,  etc.,  depending  on  the \npriorities identified by the communities. Peace-building activities to strengthen village-based \nmechanisms for conflict resolution will enable the communities to negotiate access to resources \nwith competing communities and assure equitable and sustainable distribution of benefits. \nThese activities will be inherent to the identification, prioritization, and planning process.  \n \n18.  The  beneficiary  communities  for  activities  outlined  in  this  section  will  be  selected \naccording to the following criteria: \n \n(i)  percentage of female-headed households; \n(ii)  percentage of households having access to safe drinking water; \n(iii)  number of displacements experienced by majority of community members within \nlast 10 years; \n(iv)  average level of indebtedness per household; \n(v)  number of violent incidents involving more than two people in the community in \nthe past 6 months; \n(vi)  percentage of children below 10 years who show signs of malnutrition (stunting \nor wasting); and \n(vii)  care  to  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  ethnic  composition  of  the  district  is \napproximately reflected in the choice of beneficiary communities in that district. \n \n19.  The  beneficiary  households  for  activities  outlined  in  this  section  will  be  selected \naccording to the following criteria: \n \n(i)  female-headed household without adult male wage earner; \n(ii)  inadequate housing or access to clean water and sanitation; \n(iii)  number of meals per family member during dry/low season; ", "Appendix 5  35 \n(iv)  ratio of children aged 0-16 years to adults aged 17-60 years in family; and \n(v)  viable proposals for increasing family income. \n \n20.  Benchmark surveys will be conducted prior to implementation. \n \n21.  Goods and services to be financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  standard  procedures.  Equipment  and \nmaterials will be procured by local procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. Procurement for \nsmall scale and community-based subprojects, including procurement of NGO services, will \nfollow procedures provided in Appendix 12. These procedures include ADB\u2019s approval before \nthe subproject commences.  ", "36  Appendix 6 \nCOMPONENT D:  \nJAFFNA PENINSULA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION FEASIBILITY STUDY \n \n1.  Jaffna\u2019s water supply and sanitation situation is precarious. All water for domestic and \nother uses is obtained directly from groundwater, recharged by collecting rainwater in the \nextensive pond system in the peninsula. The system is supported by barrages built long ago \nacross inlets from the sea, to provide storage and to prevent salt water contamination. All urban, \ncommercial, and agricultural waste is discharged into the same groundwater system. Barely \nadequate before the conflict, the system is now largely in ruins, due to direct war damage and \nneglected maintenance, and has effectively ceased to function. Water is provided for limited \nhours (1-2 hours maximum) through this system, from a well system in Thirunelvely and \nKondavil within the peninsula. The waste disposal system, such as it is, has caused the \ncontamination of the groundwater system. Now, all areas in the peninsula confirm the presence \nof preventable intestinal disease, with typhoid and cholera now emerging as major public health \nchallenges.  \n \nA.   Objective and Scope \n \n2.  Since direct rehabilitation intervention may worsen the situation, the Project will finance \na comprehensive feasibility study as a precondition of physical intervention. The study will \nrecommend a safe and reliable water supply and sanitation systems rehabilitation project to be \nimplemented separately. The study will also assess the institutional capacity in managing the \nsystem, and recommend an institutional development strategy. The study will do the following:  \n \n(i)  Assess the characteristics of the existing water supplies and sanitation facilities, \nhealth and decease incidences throughout the district, including the levels of \nservice, access to safe drinking water, quality of water, and cost of water.  \n(ii)  Assess the effect of the existing water supply and sanitation service levels on the \npopulation and their current socioeconomic situation.  \n(iii)  Identify all pollutant sources, and the degree of pollution caused by each of these \nsources and rank them in the order of seriousness using a suitable criteria. \n(iv)  Develop a zoning plan for land use in consultation with relevant stakeholders for \n50years\u2019 worth of projection of domestic/institutional/commercial and industrial \nwater demand. \n(v)  Work  out  the  possible  options  for  integration  of  water  scheme,  based  on \nresources availability and needs assessment to gain operational efficiency and \neconomies of scale. \n(vi)  Assess  water  needs  for  the  population  and  identifying  satisfactory  levels  of \nservices and expected population and industrial growth. \n(vii)  Categorize all available water resources covering ground water, surface water at \nIranamadu Tank, rain water harvesting, and desalination. Develop a phased plan \nfor implementation to ensure uninterrupted perennial water supply. \n(viii)  Carry out detailed cost benefit analysis of all the above possible water resources \noptions and develop criteria for prioritization of all of these options.  \n(ix)  Develop an implementation plan to address at what stage in different water \nresources options shall be harnessed and implemented. \n(x)  Provide recommendation on the appropriate technology for the extraction of \nground water giving attention to salinity intrusion and control of pollution levels. ", "  Appendix 6  37 \n(xi)  Prepare a preliminary design of the new water supply system. Include density \ncriteria to select areas to be served by urban schemes, and recommend options \nfor a rural community-based water supply system. \n(xii)  Develop policies and guidelines for water extraction rights for surface water and \nground water to encompass all the stakeholders; make recommendations for an \ninstitutional framework to administer and enact these guidelines and policies. \n(xiii)  Address the issue of the pollution of ground and surface water by haphazard \nsolid waste disposal. Provide recommendations on handling the solid waste \ngiving recommendation on appropriate technologies that could be used along \nwith a tentative investment plan. \n(xiv)  Identify  the  extent  of  mine  and  unexploded  ordnance  contamination  in  the \nselected sites for the system, and estimate the costs of their survey and removal.  \n(xv)  Prepare a financial and economic analysis for the proposed investment scenarios \nin accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines. \n(xvi)  Provide a socioeconomic profile of the intended beneficiaries and indicate how \nthe poor sector of the population will benefit from the investment following ADB \nguidelines. Prepare a strategy to increase access to service by poorer sectors of \nthe population and participation by women and minority groups and water user \ngroups. \n(xvii)  Prepare an environmental impact assessment and an appropriate resettlement \nplan as required for the proposed investment in accordance with ADB guidelines. \n(xviii)  Develop an implementation plan, including indicative procurement packaging and \nimplementation schedule, taking into account the capacity of the domestic and \nforeign contractors working in the post-conflict situation.  \n(xix)  Assess  the  need  for  complementary  sanitation  improvements  to  minimize \nimpacts on the fragile water resources in the peninsula.  \n(xx)  Develop guidelines for an on-site sanitation disposal system and recommend \nappropriate technologies to minimize ground water pollution. \n(xxi)  Assess the existing institutional set  up and its capacity to manage the water \nsupply network in the peninsula and propose intuitional arrangements for its \noperation and maintenance, incorporating the act approved by the Parliament for \nthe water supply sector and the water supply and sanitation guidelines to be \ndeveloped. \n(xxii)  Prepare a strategy to enhance institutional efficiency in billing policy, collection \nprocedures, operation and maintenance, including computerization and a staff \ndevelopment program.  \n(xxiii)  Introduce appropriate information and communication technology and networking \nwith local authorities, including the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, \nthe Water Resources Secretariat, and other institutional support required to local \nbodies and conduct public awareness campaigns on issues related to water \nconservation and sanitation.  \n(xxiv)  Prepare  designs  and  tender  documents  for  the  initial  phase  of  the \ninvestment plan.

No \nindigenous peoples will be affected, as the Project is designed to ensure that all communities, \non an equitable basis, will benefit from the Project.  The Project will address the special needs \nof minority communities in the context of their social and cultural systems. As part of the \nselection criteria, subprojects that may entail significant impacts will not be included. The Project \nwill be implemented under a sector approach, therefore, the following resettlement framework \nwas agreed upon between the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to guide \nthe Government in preparing a resettlement plan (RP) should it be found to be necessary during \nimplementation.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n3.  The resettlement framework aims to ensure that screening, planning, and management \nprocedures for involuntary resettlement on all subprojects will be in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement and other ADB social safeguard policies. \n \n4.  This policy framework has been built upon the existing laws of the land, Electricity Act \nNo. 17 1969 and amendment, National Involuntary Resettlement Policy (2001)2, and ADB\u2019s \nresettlement policy.  The policy principles adopted are as follows:  \n(i)  Avoid, minimize, and mitigate negative land acquisition and resettlement impacts \nby reviewing alternatives to the Project.  \n(ii)  If  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  the  displaced  persons  should  be \nhelped to re-establish themselves and improve their quality of life.  \n(iii)  Gender quality and equity should be ensured and adhered to throughout the \npolicy.  \n(iv)  Affected persons should be fully involved in the selection of relocation sites, \nlivelihood compensation, and development options at the earliest opportunity; \ncash compensation will be used since the Project will only require a small \namount of land.  \n(v)  Compensation for loss of land, structures, and assets should be based on full \nreplacement cost3 (including transaction costs) and should be paid promptly.  \n                                                 \n1  Insignificant impacts; it means fewer than 200 people are displaced from housing, fewer than 200 people will lose \nless than 10% of their productive assets, or 200 people or more will experience only minor impacts. A short \nresettlement plan will be required for each Category B subproject. \n2  To assist the relevant agencies in planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating all involuntary resettlement \nimpacts,  the  following  guidelines  are  provided:  i)  General  Guidelines  on  Planning  and  Implementation  of \nInvoluntary Resettlement; (ii) Guidelines for the Preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan; iii) Process Manual for \nthe Implementation of the National Involuntary Resettlement Policyof the Ministry of Land; and iv) Guidelines for a \nParticipatory Resettlement Process.\n \n3  Replacement cost means the cost of replacement of lost assets and income.  If land, it means the cost of buying a \nreplacement land near the lost land with equal productive potential plus the cost of preparing the land to levels \nsimilar to those of the affected land and cost of any registration and transfer taxes. If structures, it means current ", "42  Appendix 9 \n(vi)  Resettlement should be planned and implemented with full participation of the \nprovincial and local authorities.  \n(vii)  Help those affected to be economically and socially integrated into the host \ncommunities; participatory measures should be designed and implemented.  \n(viii)  Common  property  resources  and  community  and  public  services  should  be \nprovided. \n(ix)  Resettlement should be planned as a development activity. \n(x)  Affected persons who do not have documented title to land should receive fair \nand just treatment.  \n(xi)  Vulnerable  groups  should  be  identified  and  given  appropriate  assistance  to \nsubstantially improve their living standards.  \n(xii)  The Government should bear the full costs of compensation and resettlement. \n \n5.  Persons affected by the Project will be entitled to various types of compensation and \nresettlement assistance that will help in the restoration of their livelihoods, at least, to the pre-\nproject standards as shown in the following matrix.   \n \nTable A9:  Entitlement Matrix \nType of Losses  Entitlement  Implementation Issues \nTemporarily affected  \u2022 Rental payment during the temporary use of  The land will be restored to its \nland (during  affected person\u2019s land.  previous or better quality. \nconstruction)  \nPermanent loss of  \u2022 Cash compensation will be used since the  Payment of land will be made \nland (with land  Project will only require small amount of land.  available to the divisional \ntitle/ownership    secretaries as soon as the \nrecords)  Ministry of Finance approves \nthe proposal for payment of \ncompensation.   \nLoss of crops and  \u2022 Cash compensation for loss of crops at  The trees/crops are identified \ntrees by cultivators  replacement cost.

", "Appendix 9  43 \nC.  Procedures  \n \n6.  For the Category B subprojects, the following checklist needs to be answered and \nattached to subprojects proposals:  \n \n(i)  Will the subproject require land? What is the quantity of land required? \n(ii)  Will the impact be permanent or temporary (during construction)? \n(iii)  Who owns the land? How is land currently used? \n(iv)  If private land, how many landowners/tenants/sharecroppers will be affected? \n(v)  If state land, is it subject to customary claim? \n(vi)  If state land, are there any squatters or encroachers? \n(vii)  Are there any houses, structures, trees and crops that will be affected? \n(viii)  How many households will be physically displaced? Can they move back to the \nresidual land? \n(ix)  Are there any public or community infrastructures? \n(x)  Will indigenous peoples be adversely affected? \n \n7.  In preparing the resettlement plan, the following procedures must be followed:  \n \n(i)  Carry out consultations with various stakeholders to obtain their views on how to \navoid or minimize adverse impace impacts, prepare the resettlement plan, and \nidentify the needs and preferences of affected persons. \n(ii)  Undertake census (100% coverage), asset inventory, and detailed measurement \nsurveys.  A socioeconomic survey of sample population will also be undertaken.   \n(iii)  Analyze data to identify different categories of affected persons based on the \ndegree and scale of impacts of the subproject.   \n(iv)  Formulate  time  bound  schedule  for  resettlement  plan  implementation, \nprocedures for grievance redress, monitoring and evaluation procedures, and \nbudget. \n(v)  Prepare a draft plan following the entitlements matrix (para. 5). If there are new \ncategories of affected persons and types of losses are identified, the entitlements \nwill be included in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \n(vi)  Translate into local languages and present the draft subproject resettlement plan \nduring  consultation  and  public  meetings  for  comments.  The  final  plan  will \nincorporate the comments and suggestions of the affected communities. \n(vii)  Submit the resettlement plan to ADB for review and concurrence.  The approved \nsubproject plan will be implemented before the award of construction contracts.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements, Consultation, and Grievance Mechanisms \n \n8.  The  implementing  agency  for  the  road  component  will  be  the  Road  Development \nAuthority, for the power component will be the Ceylon Electricity Board, and for community \nrestoration component will be the North East Provincial Council, which will also be responsible \nfor overall coordination of the Project. Screening of subprojects, preparation, implementation, \nand monitoring of subproject resettlement plans will be the responsibility of the concerned \nimplementing agencies through their respective project management units (PMUs), under the \noverall coordination of the project coordinating committee, which will be established within the \nNorth East Provincial Council. \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \n9.  The  subproject  resettlement  plans,  if  required,  will  be  based  on  consultation  with \naffected  persons  and  local  government  representatives,  an  appropriate  census,  and  an \ninventory of losses. Grievances will be handled by the respective divisional secretary with the \nassistance of the village heads and PMUs. Resettlement plans will be disclosed through the \nPMU field offices and local village offices. Each implementing agency will carry out its own \ninternal  monitoring  activities  and  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  the  project  coordinating \ncommittee  and  to  ADB;  they  will  include  progress  on  planning  and  implementation  of \nresettlement plans. \n \nE.  Cost Estimates and Financing \n \n10.  The associated costs of land acquisition and resettlement, if any, will be included in the \noverall project costs.  The estimate will include measures for (i) planning and budgeting for land \nacquisition and resettlement costs, annual budget, and sources of funding; (ii) arrangements for \napproval of resettlement plan cost estimates; and (iii) the flow of funds to reach people affected.  \n \n ", "Appendix 10  45 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Project Description \n \n1.  The  Project  involves  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  national  roads,  power \ntransmission lines, and irrigation in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. The \nProject was classified as a \u201cB\u201d project and therefore an initial environmental examination (IEE) \nfor sample subproject was prepared based on the Project\u2019s fact-finding mission. The sample \nroad subproject is the rehabilitation of the Trincomalee-Kuchchiveli (50 kilometers) including \nrehabilitation of the existing platform for ferry ram, and reaping, gravelling, compacting, and \nsealing of the pavement. The sample power component is the rehabilitation of the Vavuniya-\nKillinochchi transmission system (75 kilometers), including reinstallation of substations and \ntransformers, and laying down the missing transmission line. The sample irrigation subproject is \nthe rehabilitation of the existing scheme in Batticaloa, including rehabilitation of channel and \nirrigation system, and protection of water tank. \n \nB.    General Environmental Profile of the Project Area \n \n2.  Climate. The average temperature in the project area is 29(cid:176) C \u2013 37\u00baC. There are four \nseasons influenced by the monsoon winds of the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. During the \nfirst season, mid-May to October, the leeward slopes in the project area (east and northeast) \nreceive little rain. In the second season, October through November, periodic squalls occur and \nsometimes tropical cyclones bring rain to the area. From December to March, monsoon winds \ncome from the northeast, bringing moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The northern slope and \nsome project area may be inundated by up to 125 centimeters of rain during these months. \nDuring March to mid-May, the project area may experience light showers and variable winds.  \n \n3.  Topography, Geology, and Soil.   The Project is located in dry land, on a flat plain \ndissected by long, narrow ridges of granite running from the central highlands. A coastal belt \nabout 30 meters (m) above sea level surrounds the island. In the Jaffna Peninsula, limestone \nbeds are exposed to waves as there are low-lying cliffs in almost all places. Offshore islands \ncan be found in the area, where the coast cuts across the stratification of the crystalline rocks, \nrocky cliffs, and bays. These conditions have created one of the world\u2019s best natural harbors at \nTrincomalee. The Jaffna Peninsula and Mullaittivu have miocene limestone.  The mineral \nresources found in the area are cement and clay. The soil in the project area is dominated by \nreddish brown earth. This type of soil has very high potential for agriculture, but it erodes easily.  \n4.   Surface Water and Groundwater. Sri Lanka\u2019s rivers rise in the central highlands and \nflow in a radial pattern toward the sea. Most of the rivers are short. The longest river is \nMahaweli Ganga, which passes through the project area. In the project area, the rivers feed \nnumerous artificial lakes or reservoirs (tanks) that store water during the dry season.  \n5.  Ecological Resources. The dry land\u2019s typical ground cover is scrub forest, interspersed \nwith tough bushes and cacti. Various adaptations to dry conditions have occurred to conserve \nwater, e.g., trees have thick bark, most have tiny leaves. When water is absent, the plains of the \ndry zone are dominated by brown and gray vegetation, and when the water is available, or in \nthe area near the lake or rivers, green vegetation is abundant with a high variety of flowers. \nVarieties of flowering acacia are well adapted to the arid conditions and flourish on the Jaffna \nPeninsula.  Among  the  trees  of  the  dry  land  forest  are  some  valuable  species,  such  as \nsatinwood, ebony, ironwood, and mahogany. Three sanctuaries are located in the Northern and \nEastern provinces, but none of them and no national parks are located in the project area itself.  ", "46  Appendix 10 \nC.  Environmental Profile of Areas Affected by the Project \n \n1.  Road Rehabilitation \n \n6.  The Trincomalee - Kuchchiveli road (50 kilometers [km]) lies at an altitude 1-5 m above \nsea level. The topography is mostly plain. The land use along the road consists of agriculture, \nsmall patches of settlement areas, and barren land.  The settlement area mostly belongs to ex-\nrefugees.  There are two fishing villages along the project road. There are no environmentally \nsensitive areas along this road; however, between km 10\u201314 and km 37 to the ferry platform, \nthe project road is located within 300 m of the coastal line.  \n \n2.  Power Distribution and Transmission \n \n7.  The Project\u2019s transmission line is located in the middle of the island, and the land use \nalong the transmission line is dominated by grassland, forest scrub, tanks, agriculture (paddy \nfield and other homestead), and settlement areas. There are no national parks or sanctuaries \nalong the transmission line.  \n \n  3.  Irrigation \n8.  The total area served by the Navakiri irrigation scheme is 17.505 acres, located in \nUhana  and  Porativupattu  divisions  in  Batticaloa  district.  The  land  of  the  area  includes \nagriculture, abandoned agriculture land, and scrub and spotty areas with good tree cover, \nparticularly near the water tank. The sources of water for this irrigation scheme are from \nNavakiri Aru and Senayahe Samudra. The deterioration of the scheme, particularly the part for \nconveying the water, is now quite severe.  \n \nD.   Potential Impact and Mitigation Measures \n \n9.  Road  Rehabilitation.  There  will  be  no  significant  environmental  impact  from  road \nrehabilitation due to the location of the project road; the rehabilitation will be executed only on \nthe  existing  alignment  that  is  not  located  in  any  environmentally  sensitive  area.  The \nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  stage  will  be  temporary,  including \nincreased dust and other volatile chemical substances from the asphalt plant, noise, and \nvibration. Measures to minimize  these impacts will be adopted and included in the contract \ndocuments,  and  at  least  will  include  (i)  maintaining  the  optimum  moisture  content  during \nhandling of soil, (ii) spraying water to minimize dust, (iii) maintaining safe distance between the \nasphalt  plant  and  public  facilities  including  education  facilities,  (iv)  strictly  controlling  the \nconstruction works that create noise and vibration by prohibiting night works in the residential \nareas, (v) pumping stagnant water, and (vi) providing an adequate drainage system. The \nenvironmental impact associated with the operation of the Project is mainly on traffic safety, but \nit will not be significant due to very low traffic volume on the road. Nonetheless, adequate traffic \nsigns and, if necessary, physical barriers to reduce vehicle speed will be installed. \n \n10.   Power Transmission and Distribution.  There will be no significant environmental \nimpact from the power component due to sitting of these transmission and distribution lines and \nsubstations;  project  activities  will  be  executed  at  the  existing  location.  The  environmental \nimpacts associated with the construction stage will mostly involve traffic disturbance as the \ntransmission line is located along a national road. To minimize this impact, a clear traffic sign \nwill be placed in the construction area. The good practice during the installation of cable or \ndistribution lines will be adopted and will be included in the bidding document to minimize ", "Appendix 10  47 \nelectric  shock  problems.  There  will  be  no  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the \nrehabilitation of the substation because the Project will not involve replacement of transformers \nand conductors, but it will provide new transformers to replace the missing parts. To avoid future \nproblems, the Project will use only free poly chlorinated biphenyl transformers. Due to low \npopulation density and the type of substation that will be installed, it is unlikely that there will be \ndisturbance due to the noise generated from transformers. However, to the extent possible, it is \nrecommended that the transformers be located at a reasonable distance so that the resulting \nnoise level will not exceed 55 decibels at daytime and 45 decibels at nighttime.  \n \n11.  Irrigation.  There will be no significant impact from irrigation works due to the location of \nthe Project; it will not require any land for expansion and will not affect any protected area. The \nworks will include cleaning up the sedimentation of tanks and laying down the irrigation base; no \nenvironmental impact is expected from these works. There is no evidence of salinization and \nwater logging in the project area, therefore, it is unlikely that the operation of the irrigation will \npromote salinization and water logging problems. Nonetheless, the prefabricated irrigation line \nthat will be used by the Project will further prevent salinization and water logging problems.   \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangements and Public Consultation \n     \n12.  The overall implementation of the environmental monitoring and management plan as \ndescribed in the IEE report will be the responsibility of the implementing agencies, which will \nensure  that  the  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  Government's \nenvironmental monitoring requirements. These observations will be reported as part of the \noverall project implementation reports. \n \n13.  Implementation of mitigation measures during the construction stage will be carried out \nby the contractors. An environmental engineer, as part of the implementation consultant team, \nwill assist each implementing agency in preparing contractual documentation so that the bidding \ndocuments, bills of quantity, and other contractual obligations of contractor clearly identify \nenvironmental responsibilities and describe penalties for noncompliance. The consultant will \nalso be required to assist the implementing agencies in monitoring the implementation of the \nenvironmental management plan that was described in the IEE report.  \n \n14.  The Project has been prepared based on the Needs Assessment, which was carried out \nbased  on  extensive  consultations  with  the  Government,  Liberation  Tamils  of  Tiger  Eelam \n(LTTE),  nongovernment  organizations  working  in  the  area,  civil  society,  and  others. \nConsultations with the representative of the LTTE and the local government agencies were also \nundertaken during the preparation of the IEE. Their concerns focus on their need to have a \nbetter access and electricity.  None of them indicated any long-term potential adverse impacts \ndue to the proposed Project. \n \nF.  Conclusion and Recommendations  \n \n15.  The initial  finding  of  the  IEE  study  shows  that  the  negative  environmental  impacts \nassociated with the rehabilitation of road, transmission lines, and irrigation are deemed to be \nminor and the mitigation measures will be incorporated into the contract documents for  the \ncontractors. The Project will generate environmental benefits particularly in improving access to \nthe basic services and markets due to improvement of roads, reducing the use of kerosene due \nto availability of the electricity, and improving the agriculture production due to improvement of \nirrigation.  All the proposed mitigation measures for all project components are manageable and \na full environmental impact assessment to assess further impacts of the Project is not required. ", "48  Appendix 11 \nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.   Introduction \n1.  The proposed subprojects will involve activities to rehabilitate and improve national \nroads; power transmission and distribution lines; and community restoration and development \nincluding rehabilitation of irrigation schemes,1 school buildings, water supply and sanitation \nsystems, rural roads, and small-scale renewable energy generation.  \n \n2.  In accordance with the Government's Guidance for Implementing the Environmental \nImpact Assessment 1998, all subprojects are exempted from the environmental clearance \nrequirement, except for subprojects located within the area declared as a coastal zone or \nsubject to the Forest Act and the Flora and Fauna Act (para. 5), which require environmental \nclearance from their respective project approving agencies.   \n \n3.  As the Project will only restore the pre-existing facilities damaged during the war, in \naccordance with  Environmental Assessment Guidelines 2003 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), all subprojects related to the rehabilitation of roads, power transmission, and irrigation \nscheme  (without  river  diversion)  are  categorized  as  \u201cB\u201d  projects,  while  the  remaining \nsubprojects are categorized as \"C\" projects. For each \"B\" subproject, an initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) needs to be prepared. However, for any \"B\" subproject through the area as \ndescribed in para.5, the summary IEE report and other government clearance document will \nneed to be disclosed through the ADB website as early as possible. \n \n4.   To  comply  with  both  the  Government\u2019s  and  the  ADB\u2019s  environmental  impact \nassessment requirements, the following environmental assessment framework will be adopted. \n \nB.  Subproject  Selection and Environmental Assessment \n5.  To the extent possible, proposed subprojects should not be located within the following \nareas subject to the Forest Act, the Flora and Fauna Act, and the Coast Conservation Act: \n(i)  within/or less than 100 meters (m) from sanctuaries or any national wilderness \nheritage areas including protected forests and national parks; or, \n(ii)  within coastal zones as described in the Coast Conservation Act No. 57/1988, \nnamely land area within 300 m of the coastal line, or water bodies such as \nlagoon, estuary, and river within 2 kilometers of the coastal line. \n \n6.  For each \"B\" subproject, regardless of where the subproject is located, a simplified IEE \nreport  must  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  as  part  of  the  subproject  proposal.  The \nsimplified  IEE  report,  in  a  checklist  format,  will  be  attached  in  the  project  administration \nmemorandum to be prepared during the inception mission of the Project . \n \n7.  For each \"B\" subproject located in the specified areas (para. 5), the simplified IEE report \nmust also be submitted to the relevant project approving agency for clearance. Such clearance \nmust be obtained prior to award of civil works contracts for that subproject. The approving \nagencies are (i) the Ministry of Highways for road subprojects, (ii) the Ministry of Power and \nEnergy for power transmission and renewable energy subprojects,  and  (iii)  the  Ministry  of \nIrrigation for irrigation subprojects.  \n \n                                                 \n1 The irrigation works will not involve any diversion of rivers. ", "Appendix 11  49 \nC.  Responsibilities of Implementing Agencies and ADB  \n \n8.  The following review procedure will be adopted to facilitate identification and mitigation \nof potential environmental problems/risks related to each subproject: \n \n(i)  Implementing Agencies\u2019 Responsibilities \n \n(a)  Prepare the simplified IEE report for each \"B\" subproject as required and \nsubmit to ADB as part of the subproject proposal. \n \n(b)  Obtain environmental clearance from relevant project approving agency \nfor each \"B\" subproject located in areas described in para. 5 as required \nand submit to ADB before awarding any civil works contracts for that \nsubproject. \n \n(c)  Ensure  the  implementation  of  environmental  mitigation  measures  as \ndescribed in the IEE report and the approving agency clearance (if required).   \n \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s Responsibilities \n \n(a)  Review IEE reports and approve qualifying subprojects. \n \n(b)  Publish the IEEs of the \"B\" located in the areas described in para. 5 \nsubprojects in the ADB website.  \n \n(c)  Monitor the implementation of mitigation measures through project review \nmissions,  and  conduct  environmental  performance  monitoring  as \nnecessary.   \n \nD.  Environmental Performance Monitoring and Public Disclosure \n9.  The implementing agencies must ensure that ADB is given access to all subprojects to \nundertake environmental monitoring, if needed. However, they have the full responsibility for \nmonitoring and reporting to ADB on the implementation of environmental mitigation measures \nfor all subprojects described in the IEE report and approving agency clearance (if required). The \nenvironmental monitoring report must be documented by each implementing agency as part of \nthe subproject-specific record.  \n \n10.  Each  implementing  agency  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental \nassessment  documents,  including  the  environmental  monitoring  reports,  are  properly  and \nsystematically kept as part of the subproject-specific record. \n \n11.  All  environmental  documents  are  subject  to  public  disclosure;  therefore,  these \ndocuments should be made available to public, if requested.  \n ", " 50 Appendix 12 \nCOMPONENT C:  \nSUBPROJECT SELECTION PROCESS \n \n1.  The process described in this appendix will be used to prepare subprojects under the \nCommunity Restoration and Development component of the proposed Conflict Affected Area \nRehabilitation Project.  \n \n2.  Subprojects will be initially conceived by beneficiaries, nongovernment organizations, \ngovernment departments, or newly-formed village rehabilitation committees that arose from the \nneed to restore community livelihoods and area infrastructure damaged or lost as a result of the \ndecades-long  conflict.  These  subproject  proposals  will  be  presented  first  to  the  divisional \nrehabilitation committee present in each of the eight project districts. This committee then \nreviews  and  evaluates  each  proposal  against  the  set  subproject criteria. If approved, the \nproposal will be forwarded to the district rehabilitation coordinating committee (DRCC), which \nfurther scrutinizes the subproject. The district project management unit (PMU) assists these \nagencies in preparation of the subproject proposals in the standard formats used for the Project.  \n \n3.  After approval by the DRCC, district PMU through the government agent or district \nsecretary presents the subproject to the PMU located in Trincomalee. The PMU makes a \ndetailed review of each subproject, considering if the subproject (i) addresses the overall scope \nof Project, (ii) is eligible under the general and subcomponent-related criteria, (iii) will create any \nproblems in the area, (iv) has been sufficiently justified, and (v) will attain the desired outputs \nand benefits.  The PMU also (i) performs a detailed review of the subproject cost estimate and \nimplementation schedule; (ii) verifies beneficiary contribution; (iii) assesses if contractors are \navailable and capable of performing the work; (iv) confirms that land will be available as \nnecessary; and (v) investigates any gender-related, social, or environmental concerns.  \n \n4.  If the PMU finds that the subproject satisfies all the evaluation criteria, the proposal will \nbe then forwarded to the project coordinating committee (PCC) and, 15 days prior to a PCC \nmeeting,  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  relevant  secretaries, \nministries,  provincial  and  district  heads  of  departments,  government  agents,  government \nsecurity coordinators (Police, Army), nongovernment oganizations, the United Nations system, \nand any other development institution implementing projects in the area (World Bank, World \nUniversity Services of Canada, etc.).  \n \n5.  The PCC, chaired by the chief secretary of the North East Provincial Council, meets, \ntypically at 2-month intervals, to present each subproject for conditional approval. Attendees at \nthe PCC include ADB, relevant PMU staff, government agents, district deputy project directors, \nand representatives from concerned national ministries. Subprojects not approved by the PCC \nwill be returned to the PMU/district PMU for further clarification or justification. If approved by \nthe PCC, the PMU informs the proponent to further develop the subproject to include the \ndesigns, bill of quantities, specifications, and the bid documents. The final proposal will then be \nforwarded to ADB for approval.  Subprojects not approved by ADB will be returned to the PMU \nfor further clarification or modifications to better comply with project criteria or ADB guidelines.  \n \n6.  Once ADB gives final approval, competitive tenders will be called, bids will be evaluated, \nand awards will be made to the substantially responsive lowest bidder.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSectors  identified  as  national  priorities  in  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty \ncountry poverty analysis? Yes  partnership agreement? Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \n   The 2 decades of conflict damaged physical infrastructure, deprived communities of basic services, and \ndestroyed productive assets and social capital. It has caused people to lose income and property; it \nalso caused death, physical injury, psychological stress and war-related trauma. War also prevented \nnew investments from taking place. It created deep fractures and accentuated ethnic tensions within \nand among communities. \n \n   Reestablishing and restoring essential infrastructure, particularly the road network, power and electricity \nsupply, water supply, sanitation, and irrigation facilities is critical for the revival and resumption of \neconomic activities that could contribute to employment creation, income generation, rehabilitation of \ndisplaced populations, improvement of security and stability, interethnic reconciliation, and political \nunification  of  the  country.  Moreover,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  restoring  people's  livelihood, \nincreasing social stability and harmony, and enhancing economic recovery through improving education \nfacilities, applying 'do-no-harm' procedures, and introducing postconflict impact assessments as filters \nfor prioritization of interventions assuring ethnically equitable distribution of benefits. \n    \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n \nThe Northern and Eastern provinces constitute about 30% of Sri Lanka's land area, and a population \nestimated to be about 2 million or 10% of the national population. There were some 800,000 internally \ndisplaced persons, most of whom were women and children. Up to a million people left the country. In \n2002, over 270,000 displaced people spontaneously returned to their areas of origin. A number of people \nwho had been living abroad have also returned. It is expected that the movement of persons to and within \nthe conflict-affected areas will continue. Many of these returnees and refugees are especially vulnerable \ndue to gender, age, disability, belonging to ethnic or religious minorities, or their underprivileged social \nstatus.   \n \nLess than 15% of the road surface in the region is still intact. As little or no maintenance was carried out \nduring the conflict, all pavement surfaces have deteriorated and some have entirely disappeared. There \nhas been considerable damage to the power distribution system. Households currently electrified in the \nNorthern Province is 20% and in the Eastern Province 40% as against a national average of 56%. The \nconflict has prevented any progress that might otherwise have occurred, and on the contrary has made \nthe situation worse.  \n \nIn most towns, water supply service is limited to 1-2 hours per day in limited service areas. The overhead \nwater reservoirs and the distribution networks have been damaged or destroyed. The proportion of \nhouseholds who have access to safe water supply is only 20% as compared to 45% nationally, and the \npercentage of households who have access to sanitation is 25% compared to the national average of \n72%.  All  districts  confirm  the  presence  of  preventable  intestinal  disease.  Many  districts  report  the \nemergence  of  typhoid  and  cholera  epidemic  proportions,  indicating  faecal  pollution  of  the  shallow \ngroundwater resources.  \n \nAll aspects of the education system, from pre-school to tertiary and technical-vocational, are severely \ndamaged.  Problems  such  as  nonenrollment,  dropouts,  absenteeism,  and  poor  learning  quality  are \naggravated  as  a  consequence  of  displacement,  poverty,  single-headed  households,  damaged \ninfrastructure, and lack of human resources. The rate of student dropout is 15%, almost four times the ", "  Appendix 14  53 \nnational average. About 50,000 children are out of school. \n \nIn the northeast, the agricultural sector's contribution to the gross domestic product had amounted to \naround 40%, whereas for the entire country agriculture accounts for about 20%. However, due to the \nconflict, minor irrigation schemes are in poor condition, out of the 2,398 minor irrigation tanks recorded in \nthe area, over 30% require rehabilitation due to the impact of the war. Destruction and loss of livestock \ncaused a significant decline in the livestock population. Most of the formerly surplus-producing agricultural \nareas have changed into food-deficit areas. Substantial destruction of standing crops and those around \nhomesteads took place, and farming equipment and infrastructure were lost. Mines and unexploded \nordnance still prevent access to livelihoods, to agricultural and common land, economic and social \ninfrastructure. \n \nThe conflict in Sri Lanka has been a constraint to growth and poverty reduction. It has not only caused \nextensive suffering and dislocation in the region but has also sharply reduced the economic contribution \nof the region to national development, led to mounting defense expenditures, restrained growth in social \nexpenditures,  discouraged  investment,  and  stifled  tourism.  It  was  estimated  that  the  conflict  has \npotentially reduced 2 percentage points of annual growth for the country in the past 2 decades. The \ngrowth in the conflict area in particular has been even worse. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nThe Project will be implemented through stakeholder consultation. Community consultation will be carried \nout to determine subproject selection priority. Methodologies conducive to community participation, local \ncapacity building, and the provision of employment will be introduced. Depending on the technical \nrequirements, opportunities for local communities to work in the project implementation will be \nincorporated. \n \nD.

Background \n \n1.  Sri Lanka is currently emerging from two decades of armed conflict, a conflict which \nitself stemmed from previous decades of accumulating social tensions. Consequences of the \nconflict  include  more  than  60,000  people  killed,  more  than  800,000  persons  displaced \ninternally, tens of thousands of families who have fled the country, physical infrastructures\u2014 \nespecially in the north and the east\u2014devastated, an economy starved of investment and \nhobbled by insecurity, enormous social trauma, and a significant deterioration in the quantity of \nqualified human resources available in both the social and economic spheres. A memorandum \nof understanding signed by the Government and the Liberation Tamils of Tiger Eelam (LTTE) in \nearly 2002 has generated fresh hope that a lasting peace can now be negotiated and serve as \na basis for the future development of the country. \n \n2.  Political structures in government-controlled areas are democratic, but decision-making \nauthority remains hierarchical and highly centralized in Colombo. The technical quality of public \nservices is quite good compared to most developing countries, although their efficiency is often \nquestioned. For several decades, government structures have tended to be dominated by the \nmajority  ethnic  community.  In  LTTE-controlled  areas,  decision-making  authority  is  highly \nconcentrated in the hands of a small group of senior leaders, who until now have exercised this \nauthority with very little direct accountability to the local populations. Technical capacity with \nregards to governance in these areas tends to be low, due to the flight of many skilled Tamils. \nIntimidation and killing are not unknown tactics for silencing critics or competitors for local \npower, although the identity of the perpetrators is not always clear. Abuses of human rights \nwere widespread during the years of conflict. \n \n3.  Most of the conflict-affected areas, whether on the government or LTTE side, have been \nessentially devoid of new investment during the 20 years of armed conflict, although initial signs \nof  new  investment,  both  public  and  private,  have  begun  to  emerge  since  the  cease-fire \nagreement was signed in early 2002. On balance, the private sector plays a greater role in \neconomic life than it did 20 years ago. Taxes have become a controversial issue in LTTE-\ncontrolled areas, with the LTTE imposing various types of levies on individuals and companies \nin order to finance a portion of their activities. While reliable social statistics are not available for \nthe areas targeted by this Project, anecdotal evidence from numerous aid agencies indicates \nthat social problems such as alcoholism, domestic violence, sexual abuse, drug abuse, and \nsuicide  have  significantly  increased  over  the  years  of  conflict.  Such  increases  suggest \nwidespread  psychological  trauma,  alienation,  and  stress  resulting  from  the  breakdown  of \ntraditional social support networks. \n \n4.  Key actors who have an influence on the evolving conditions in the conflict-affected \nareas include the LTTE, who wish to ensure that peace will bring not only rehabilitation to the \nnorth and east, but also significant autonomy in the governance of the region. The Government, \nwhich controls about half of the conflict-affected areas, including Jaffna, sees peace and the \nensuing stability as an essential ingredient in re-launching Sri Lanka\u2019s economy. However, \nthere are elements in the south that continue to actively promote the dominance of the largest \nethnic community, thus limiting the Government\u2019s scope to take peace initiatives and to make \nwhat are perceived by some as unacceptable concessions. ", "    Appendix 15  55\nB.  Project Context \n \n5.  The Project will be implemented partly in government-controlled areas and partly in \nLTTE-controlled territory. Although boundary lines between these areas will be the subject of \nfuture peace negotiations, for the moment they are not actively contested by either party. The \npolitical and security situation in the project area will depend greatly on the progress of the \npeace talks, but for the moment it is generally stable, although punctuated by frequent reports \nof relatively minor breaches of the ceasefire agreement and of intimidation of local citizens and \ngroups. Economically, there has been some improvement since the ceasefire agreement in \nearly 2002, with some small-scale private investment, notably in the services sector, some \nincrease in rehabilitation activities by aid organizations, and increased trade due to the opening \nof road links between LTTE and government-controlled areas. Poverty remains nevertheless \nendemic, with tens of thousands of internally displaced families looking to resettle in their \nplaces of origin. These returns are significantly augmenting the population of a number of \ndistricts such as Jaffna, Kilinochchi, and Mullaitivu that had seen large outflows during the war. \n \n6.  In areas of mixed ethnic composition, notably in the east, relations between the three \nmain groups (Tamil, Singhalese, and Muslim) have degenerated in recent months, despite the \nefforts of community leaders to establish conflict resolution mechanisms. Competition over \nlimited  resources  and  disputed  land  rights  in  some  areas  have  acted  as  triggers  for \nintercommunal  violence  on  recent  occasions.  Currently  many  Muslim  communities  feel \nmarginalized  in  debates  over  the  country\u2019s  future,  believing  their  specific  needs  are  not \nadequately taken into account and feeling under threat by the LTTE. Singhalese community \nmembers, especially those along the east coast, generally feel vulnerable to LTTE pressure \nand complain of not being adequately protected by the government. Tamils are cautiously \nhopeful that the LTTE and the government will continue to advance in establishing a lasting \npeace, but also appear unsettled by recent intercommunal violence. \n \n7.  The ethnic composition varies across the project area, with Tamils strongly dominating \nin the north. In the districts in the east, the three main groups are relatively equally balanced. \nNevertheless, individual communities tend to be essentially mono-ethnic, thus producing a \nschool system that is fragmented as well as communities that do not communicate easily with \neach other. \n \n8.  Infrastructure in much of the project area, but especially the north, was destroyed or \nseverely damaged during the armed conflict, while the rest was not maintained and therefore \ndeteriorated due to lack of funds or access. Since the ceasefire, most people appear to feel that \ntheir personal security has improved, but also fear the gains are fragile. Some studies, such as \none commissioned by Canadian  International  Development  Agency  in  2002,1 suggest that \npsychological trauma is widespread among all ages, with feelings of fear, depression, and \nhelplessness  being  common.  Children  have  been  particular  victims,  not  only  due  to  the \npsychological trauma suffered at an impressionable age, but also due to malnutrition that has \nhampered their development, loss of years of schooling, and exposure to physical dangers \nsuch as landmines. Many women have suffered the trauma of losing the main breadwinner in \nthe family, obliging them to provide for their children and elder parents, often after being forced \nfrom  their  land.  In  addition,  the  conflict  environment  has  rendered  women  particularly \nvulnerable to sexual harassment. \n                                                 \n1  Simms, Dr. Chris. 2002. Study on Psychosocial Distress in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka. ", "56  Appendix 15 \nC.  Prognosis \n \n9.  The general trend over the past 18 months has been a gradual decrease in the overall \nlevel of tension in the country, although there is a clear sense that this decrease could easily be \nreversed. In addition, the general trend does not exclude outbreaks of violence in specific \nlocations as a result of local \u201ctriggers\u201d being set off by local issues. These issues tend to be \nrelated to competition for local resources, for example fish or access to arable land. Because of \nthe lack of trust and effective dispute resolution mechanisms at higher levels, the danger is that \nthese local triggers can cause wider eruptions of violence through contagion. In the current \ncontext, this danger appears more of a concern than national or subnational leaders inciting \ntheir followers to violence at the local level. \n \n10.   Because specific ethnic groups tend to dominate in specific economic sectors, the \nproject implementers will need aware that certain project interventions might be perceived as \nfavoring one group at the expense of another. Thus they will need to consider not only whether \naid to one sector will achieve the desired outputs but also the potential impact on other groups \nin the area. In addition, they will need to ensure that the way aid is apportioned between \ndifferent sectors allows for a reasonably equitable sharing of benefits among all ethnic groups. \n \n11.  Groups that may consider they could benefit from a re-escalation of tensions or even \nconflict include security forces on both sides whose influence and resources have expanded \ngreatly over the life of the conflict and could be expected to shrink if and as long-term peace \ntakes root. Thus demilitarization will soon become an issue if the peace process is to be \nconsolidated.  \n \n12.  With regards to groups that can play a mitigating or transforming role in the event that \nsocio-political tensions worsen, there are numerous religious authorities of all faiths who appear \nwilling  to  contribute  at  both  the  local  and  provincial  levels.  There  are  also  a  number  of \nexperienced NGOs with extensive roots in the area, who have developed both credibility and \nexpertise in conflict mediation and transformation at the local level. Finally, a number of \ncommunity-based organizations, such as village rehabilitation committees, have generated \ncredible  leaders  over  the  past  several  years  who  could  also  be  a  useful  resource  in \nconstructively addressing local tensions. \n \n13.  The most likely scenario over the next few years is that the overall peace will hold, \ndespite periodic confrontations and outbreaks of violence. However, achieving transparent, \neffective, democratic governance according to generally accepted international norms is likely \nto continue to be a problem in the near future, acting as a brake on the long-term development \nof the country, particularly in the northeast but also to some extent in the south. As a result, the \nProject will need to pay particular attention to the quality of its management and how the \noutputs connect with the governance structures that will be put into place as the peace process \nadvances. \n \nD.  Project Parameters \n \n14.  A key to the project being perceived as providing a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d will be the extent to \nwhich target populations consider that benefits to them are being maximized. This means that \nnot only should the outputs (roads, schools, community services) be efficiently delivered but \nalso that implementation methods favor the maximization of benefits locally. For example, local ", "    Appendix 15  57\nlabor  should  be  used  as  much  as  possible  while  contracts  and  subcontracts  should  be \ndesigned to facilitate the participation and reinforcement of domestic contractors. Also, where \nwork is to be implemented by civil society organizations such as nongovernment organizations, \nattention should be accorded to strengthening their technical and management capacity as \nneeded, in order to ensure not only the effectiveness of the work they carry out for the Project \nbut also their capacity to contribute to the future development of their area.  \n \n15.  The Project as it is formulated has the capacity to apportion benefits in an equitable \nmanner among the different ethnic groups, subject to the provisos mentioned earlier and \nsubject to ethnicity being one of the criteria (but not the only one) used in targeting specific \ncommunities. There is a risk that certain parts of the Project may be temporarily destabilized by \nthe eruption of local tensions, but as long as tensions remain local, this is likely to be of short \nduration. However, past experience indicates that the protection will be more cost effective if \nthe Project, when it enters a district or a new locality, takes the time to explain its objectives to \nlocal leaders and to gain their endorsement. In addition, the specific peace-building measures \nreferred to in the section on livelihoods can equip the beneficiary communities to deal more \nconstructively and more effectively with the inevitable intra- and intercommunity tensions that \nwill arise and that risk destroying or reversing the gains made as a result of this emergency \nProject. It will also be useful for the periodic project reviews to include assessments of changes \nin the political and security environment and how/if they impact on the Project, as well as how \nthe project appears to be impacting on peace and conflict factors in the target areas.  \n \nE.  Correspondence between Project and Context \n \n16.  As  the  project  responds  to  generally  recognized  needs,  the  support  for  such \ninterventions is by and large strong among government and LTTE representatives, as well as \nwith community leaders. However, in the light of negotiations with regards to a proposed interim \nadministration for the north and east and eventually on how the concept of federalism is to be \ndefined by the negotiating parties, it will likely be necessary that ADB discuss carefully with the \nGovernment and the LTTE how decisions agreed at the negotiating table affect implementation \narrangements for the Project, within the parameters of the original loan agreement. Most of the \nexecuting agencies indicated in the project proposal should not present significant problems \nwith  regards  to  exacerbating  tensions,  given  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  previous \nexperience  with  similar  activities  in  the  area  and  the  relations  of  mutual  trust  that  have \ndeveloped. \n \nF.  Projected Impacts \n \n17.  As long as the beneficial outcomes are shared reasonably equitably among the major \nethnic groups and across the target area, the Project is not expected to contribute to an \nintensification of social tensions. In addition, the modest-sized nature of the projected project \nactivities appears to make them unlikely to be captured by elite or sectarian interests. Possible \ninadvertent negative outcomes for this type of project that will need to be monitored include \nopportunities for illegitimate profit taking on construction contracts and opportunities for levying \nvarious types of nontransparent taxes or fees by nonstate actors. \n \n18.  Regarding the potential for disillusionment among the beneficiary populations once they \nsee the actual outcomes delivered by the Project, the danger appears to be fairly modest, given \nthe small scale, local nature of the outputs and the opportunity for the communities in the target ", "58  Appendix 15 \nareas to define a portion of the inputs they will receive. The key will be in maintaining complete \ntransparency with both the local authorities and the ultimate beneficiaries on what the Project \ncan and cannot deliver and consulting with local representatives on the most appropriate \nmethodology to adopt as the Project advances. This includes being sensitive to any changes in \napproach  that  appear  to  be  advisable  in  the  light  of  changing  circumstances  over  the \nimplementation period. A further significant asset of the Project, which will help ensure that the \noutcomes are sustainable over time and are realized in a stable environment, is the support \nbeing planned for specific peace-building activities at the community level. These activities will \nhelp ensure that the target communities develop or reinforce conflict-resolution mechanisms to \npeacefully and equitably solve disputes that arise during and after the implementation period. \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n19.  The  components  of  the  Project  as  presented  can  potentially  make  a  positive \ncontribution to the rebuilding of the infrastructure and socioeconomic fabric of the conflict-\naffected areas of Sri Lanka. The challenge will be in implementing the Project in a sensitive \nmanner, i.e., ensuring that: \n \n(i)  Districts and communities are selected in ways that ensure an ethnic balance that \nreasonably reflects the general ethnic composition of that area. \n(ii)  Rigorous measures are applied to limit the potential of corruption diverting resources \nto local, subnational, and national elites. \n(iii)  All phases of the Project are characterized by transparency, so that the relevant \nauthorities, community leaders, and beneficiaries understand the project parameters \nand how the Project is progressing. \n(iv)  Community-level peace-building activities are designed and implemented in ways \nthat make the target communities more resilient to pressures that might otherwise \nlead to violence. \n(v)  Implementation is done using local human and material resources as much as \npossible, encouraging a sense of ownership of the dividends flowing from the \nceasefire. \n \n20.  Indicators that might be considered in order to track changes in the degree and nature \nof communal tensions and that could serve as warning (or reassuring) signs, include: \n \n(i)  the number of violent incidents involving four or more people\u2014averaged on a per \ncommunity basis\u2014within the previous 6 months; \n(ii)  the number of disputes involving more than five households\u2014averaged on a per \ncommunity basis\u2014that have been resolved in a nonviolent manner in the past \n6months; \n(iii)  the average total number of times each family in the village\u2014averaged on a per \ncommunity basis\u2014has traveled to another village or town in the previous month; \nand \n(iv)  the judgment in community meetings as to whether the present security climate in \ntheir area is very poor, poor, fair, good, or very good.
