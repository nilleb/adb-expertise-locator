With economic growth averaging about 5.8% per annum since the end of the conflict in \n2009, Sri Lanka is close to attaining upper middle-income country status.1 To serve the dynamic \ntransformation of the economy, the functions of the transport sector are gradually changing to \nprovide growth-oriented infrastructure, support more diversified services, promote export, and \ncater  to  the  value-adding  manufacturing  industry.  New  economic  activities  continue  to  be \nestablished close to population centers and international gateways. Colombo is the center of \ncommercial and administrative functions with the largest international port. The Western Province, \nwhich includes Colombo, accounts for more than 40% of the national gross domestic product. \nAbout 48.7% of Sri Lanka\u2019s urban population is in Colombo, a district with a population of 2.3 \nmillion. The smooth flow of goods and people in an area with great potential is key to developing \nan efficient and high-value-added economy. \n \n2.  The road network is modestly developed in Sri Lanka. Passenger traffic is estimated to be \n80 billion passenger-kilometers, out of which road transport has a share of 93%. Road transport \nalso has the dominant share of 97% in freight ton-kilometers. The road area ratio in the Colombo \nmunicipal council area is 10.7%, better than in other congested Asian cities (e.g., Bangkok 7.1%, \nJakarta 7.3%). However, traffic mobility in Colombo is deteriorating because of (i) the increasing \ntraffic demand in the district with the most economic potential, (ii) further development of the \nexpressway network, and (iii) the inefficient logistics infrastructure to the port despite the rapid \nexpansion of the international gateway facilities to the world. The transport sector faces major \nchallenges: (i) how to alleviate the intensifying congestion in Colombo without large-scale land \nacquisition; (ii) how to efficiently manage the incoming traffic through the New Kelani Bridge (NKB) \nfrom the expressway network, minimizing the burden on the existing road network in Colombo; \nand (iii) how to handle the increasing traffic of heavy vehicles to and from Colombo port without \ncausing congestion in the surrounding area. \n \n3.  The proposed project will construct about 5.3 kilometers (km) of an elevated toll highway \nin Colombo between the NKB and the city center of Galle Face through the Colombo port \npremises, and support trade logistics facilitation to provide better logistics services for port users.2 \nIt  will  provide  a  direct  link from  the city  center  and the  port to  the Colombo\u2013Katunayake \nExpressway (CKE) via the NKB with a modern toll collection system, and then constitute a part of \nthe expressway network of Sri Lanka.3 The project will help alleviate traffic congestion in the \ndensely populated areas around the international port, and also improve logistics connectivity \nbetween the international gateway and potential economic hinterland along the expressway \nnetwork, thereby increasing economic efficiency and competitiveness of the country. \n \n4.  The project is aligned with the following impact: economic growth and regional trade and \ncooperation of the country facilitated. The project will have the following outcome: transport \nefficiency along the project road increased. The project is estimated to cost $360.2 million. The \ngovernment has requested a regular loan of $300 million from Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nordinary capital resources to help finance the project. \n \n \n                                                \n1  World Bank. World Bank Country and Lending Groups (accessed 7 June 2018). Per capita income in 2016 was \n$3,850. The World Bank defines upper middle-income economies as those with a gross national income per capita \nof $3,956\u2013$12,235. \n2  The project will construct along the route a dedicated ramp to the port for port-related traffic. \n3  Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). 2014. Ex-Ante Evaluation: New Bridge Construction Project over \nthe Kelani River. JICA is financing the NKB. \n ", "2 \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The Road Development Authority (RDA) has expanded its expressway network since the \nSouthern Expressway, Sri Lanka\u2019s first expressway, was opened to traffic in 2011. The CKE has \nbeen in operation since 2013, and a part of the Outer Circular Highway since 2014.  \n \n6.  The current toll rate policy and toll collection system have been developed on a project-\nby-project basis. Therefore, toll rates and collection systems differ among expressways. However, \nonce the rest of the OCH is completed, the three expressways will be connected with each other. \nThe planned new Central Expressway leading to the OCH will also join the network. Furthermore, \nthe NKB, funded and implemented by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, links the CKE \nto the proposed elevated toll highway. The proposed project will become a part of the expressway \nnetwork.  The  expanded  expressway  network  will  require  a  comprehensive,  modern,  and \nconsistent toll policy and collection system to operate efficiently. \n \n7.  Toll rate management. The current toll rates consist of fixed fees and variable fees based \non project-specific parameters such as recovery period, construction cost, and traffic volume. \nThese parameters are, in principle, kept constant; thus, there is no built-in mechanism to regularly \nreview and update the rates. Revenue from the three expressways in 2016 was about $48 million, \nwhich still exceeds actual operation and maintenance costs of $12 million. However, the current \nrates and toll policy may be neither reasonable nor sustainable in the emerging landscape \nbecause (i) application of different rates to each expressway would be unfair and even confusing \nto road users under the network; (ii) the expanding expressway network has yet to be incorporated \nin the toll rate policy; (iii) parameters used for the calculation do not include augmentation of \nexpressway capacity, vehicle volume, and operation and maintenance costs; (iv) no inflation \nfactor is considered; and (v) the impact of any new toll collection technology needs to be fully \nincorporated. The technical assistance (TA) will assist in developing a new accountable toll rate \nmanagement tool to address long-term operational sustainability for the expanding expressway \nnetwork.  \n \n8.   Toll collection system. The toll collection system also varies among the expressways. \nThe CKE uses both manual toll collection and electronic toll collection (ETC) with a simple open \ntolling system, whereas the OCH and Southern Expressway use only manual toll collection with \na closed system. The ETC system adopted in the CKE is very limited with radio-frequency \nidentification (RFID) passive technology, compared with more advanced systems currently in \noperation in other countries. Therefore, the RDA decided to adopt a new ETC system of multi-\nlane free flow for the proposed project, which will be expanded to other expressways as a national \nETC system architecture. Although operation and maintenance of the system are basically \noutsourced through a service agreement, it still requires policy-level initiatives and institution-level \ncapacity development. The TA will support (i) the preparation of an action plan to create an \nenabling environment for the ETC system, (ii) the preparation of an information-technology-\nrelated organizational structure and identification of required human resources in the RDA, and \n(iii) the training of staff of the new information technology section to efficiently manage the system. \nThe  TA  will  also  assist  in  enhancing  expressway  management  capacity  by  obtaining  key \noperational parameters to be secured by the newly introduced ETC system. \n \n9.  Considering the TA\u2019s objective to support policy initiatives and institutional capacity \ndevelopment in the new areas, the ADB-administered TA will be a better tool than a loan \nconsulting service under the proposed loan project. Direct supervision of the consultant\u2019s activities \n ", "3 \nby ADB will ensure neutrality and quality of services in these areas that are unfamiliar to the RDA. \nThe proposed TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020.4 \n \nB.
