I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \n(i) partial credit guarantee (PCG) of up to P8,025,000,000 of principal and interest thereon to \nbondholders;  and  (ii)  loan  of  up  to  P1,800,000,000  (or  its  equivalent  in  US  dollars)  to \nAP Renewables, Inc. (APRI) for the Tiwi and MakBan Geothermal Power Green Bonds Project in \nthe Philippines. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Despite the potential of geothermal power to help overcome the Philippines\u2019 electricity \nshortage with indigenous low-carbon energy, few geothermal power transactions have occurred \nin the country, mainly due to a lack of risk appetite on the part of developers and lenders. One \nsignificant  exception  has  been  the  privatization  and  repowering  of  the  Tiwi  and  Makiling\u2013\nBanahaw  (MakBan)  power  plant  complexes.  The  facilities\u2014the  seventh  and  fourth  largest \ngeothermal  power  stations  in  the  world,  respectively\u2014were  developed  in  the  1970s  by  the \ngovernment\u2019s  National  Power  Corporation.  Originally  built  with  a  nameplate  capacity  of \n676 megawatts (MW) (234 MW at Tiwi and 442 MW at MakBan), the facilities had fallen into \nsevere disrepair by the mid-2000s. Effective availability in 2007 was 41% at Tiwi and 63% at \nMakBan, well below industry standards.1 \n \n3.  As part of a broad plan to divest state-owned electricity assets, Tiwi and MakBan were \nsold  through  public  bidding  in  2009  to  Aboitiz  Renewables,  Inc.  (ARI),  an  Aboitiz  Power \nCorporation (APC, or the sponsor) subsidiary and a leading local developer of renewable energy. \nARI\u2019s acquisition of Tiwi\u2013MakBan was financed on an all-equity basis because, at the time, the \ncompany was unable to secure project financing from commercial banks.2 In the absence of debt \nfinancing, APC not only invested equity in the acquisition but also in plant rehabilitation. By mid-\n2013, after 4 years of turnaround activities, the sponsor had increased plant availability to above \n90%, improved generation efficiency, and significantly extended the plants\u2019 operating life. Today, \nTiwi\u2013MakBan accounts for 14% of the Luzon grid\u2019s dependable capacity of renewable energy. \n \n4.  ADB approached APC in August 2014 with a proposal to normalize Tiwi\u2013MakBan\u2019s capital \nstructure (i.e., to transition it from an all-equity financing to a more conventional debt\u2013equity mix) \nthrough the issuance of a project bond. The structure was proposed as a way to help APC \nredeploy invested capital for new projects (including renewable power) without undermining the \ncompany\u2019s ability to raise debt from local banks. The project represents a first effort by ADB in \ntackling challenges faced by local developers and banks in the Philippines. \n \n2.  Sector Overview \n5.  Geothermal energy. The Philippines has an estimated 4,790 MW of potential geothermal \ncapacity. Although only a small part of these resources is being exploited, the country is already \n                                                \n1  Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM). 2008. Information Memorandum: Tiwi \nGeothermal Power Plant Complex and MakBan Geothermal Power Plant Complex. Manila. \n2  During 2008\u20132009, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and several Philippine commercial banks considered joint \nfinancing, but upon the withdrawal of commercial banks, the transaction was cancelled. The banks\u2019 withdrawal was \ncaused by insufficient risk appetite. \n ", "2 \n \nthe world\u2019s second largest geothermal power producer; 11% of the country\u2019s installed power \ncapacity  (1,868  MW  in  2013)  is geothermal  energy,  accounting for  9,605 gigawatt-hours of \ngeneration in 2013. The government wants to boost this capacity by 70% by 2030 to reach 3,200 \nMW.  The  ambitious  target  is  based  on  geothermal  energy\u2019s  perceived  advantages  in \nenvironmental performance, energy security, and avoidance of fuel import costs. However, only \n20 MW have been added since 2008. Barriers include the high cost of steam exploration, long \ndevelopment lead times, and the small number of experienced local developers and lenders. \n \n6.  Wholesale  Electricity  Spot  Market.  The  Philippines\u2019  spot  market  for  power,  the \nWholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM), was established in 2006 to encourage competition \nand reduce energy prices. The market follows a gross-offer-pool, net-settlement model, and \nenables the trading of electricity as a commodity in 24 hourly trading periods. All available power \nin the system\u2014including contracted capacity sold under bilateral arrangements\u2014is delivered \nthrough WESM and prices for spot transactions are set through competitive bidding. \n \n7.  Project bonds. Decades of low public and private spending have left the Philippines with \ninsufficient infrastructure, even when compared with peer developing member countries (DMCs), \nand  the  gap  between  infrastructure  investments  and  requirements  is  widening.  Bonds  are \nincreasingly  seen  as  a  way  to  close  the  financing  gap,  as  they  can  match  the  financing \nrequirements of large infrastructure projects with a growing appetite for long-term assets among \ninstitutional investors. Project bonds (i.e., bonds issued to fund specific infrastructure projects) in \nthe Philippine power sector, while still developing, can play a role in funding projects.3 ADB is \nsupporting the expansion of domestic debt capital markets, and working to establish a policy \nframework for project bonds in the Philippines.4 \n \n8.  Green bonds. Green bonds enable the raising of capital for and investments in new and \nexisting projects with environmental benefits, such as renewable energy. Institutional investors in \nmany countries increasingly seek to integrate environmental, social, and governance factors into \ntheir investment processes, and green bonds can address such needs.5 To qualify as green, a \nbond issuance should meet voluntary guidelines for impact, additionality, and transparency. One \nemerging subset of green bonds are climate bonds, whose environmental benefits are certified by \nan independent standard-setting organization.6 \n \n3.  Project Design \n9.  The project involves APRI's refinancing of capital expenditure (including acquisition and \nplant rehabilitation) and ongoing operation and maintenance in Tiwi and MakBan, two major \ngeothermal power generation complexes on Luzon: \n                                                \n3  One notable exception is a 1997 bond for a Philippine power project (Quezon Power) sold to United States investors \nand refinanced in 2011 with a 5-year bond sold to Philippine banks; both issuances were in US dollars. \n4  The  project  would  provide  direct  support  to  two  proposed  programs:  ADB.  Forthcoming.  Concept  Paper: \nEncouraging Investment through Capital Market Reforms Program. Manila; and ADB. Forthcoming. Concept Paper: \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Program Loan Cluster. Manila. The proposed Encouraging Investment through Capital \nMarket Reform Program will apply sequenced reforms to (i) develop the government bond market as a precursor to \ndeveloping the corporate and project bond markets, (ii) encourage growth in domestic long-term savings, and (iii) \nease barriers to entry to diversify and broaden available sources of long-term finance. The proposed Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Program will strengthen financial support to PPPs, expand and efficiently implement the pipeline of PPP \nprojects, and strengthen the legal and regulatory frameworks for PPPs.   \n5  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD).  2012.

", "3 \n \n \n(i)  The Tiwi complex (Tiwi) is located in the province of Albay, about 569 kilometers \nsouth  of  Metro  Manila.  With  a  combined  installed  capacity  of  234  MW,  Tiwi \nconsists of three power plants with two generating units each. The units were \ncommissioned between 1979 and 1982. \n(ii)  The  Makiling\u2013Banahaw  complex  (MakBan)  is  located  about  70  kilometers \nsoutheast of Metro Manila on the boundary of Laguna and Batangas provinces. \nWith a combined capacity of 442 MW, MakBan consists of five power plants with a \ntotal of 10 generating units. The units were commissioned between 1979 and \n1996. \n \n10.  Tiwi\u2013MakBan  sales  are  marketed  through  a  mix  of  bilateral  sales  agreements  and \nwholesale spot market sales into WESM. \n \n4.  The Borrower \n11.  The  borrower,  APRI,  is  the  owner-operator  of  the  Tiwi\u2013MakBan  plants  (its  sole \noperations). APRI was registered in 2007 as a Philippines company, and is wholly owned by the \nsponsor via an intermediate company, Aboitiz Renewables, Inc. \n \n5.  The Sponsor \n12.  APC,  the  sponsor,  is  a  leading  developer  and  operator  of  power  generation  and \ndistribution assets in the Philippines. It has 2,334 MW of attributable generation capacity, most of \nwhich is on the Luzon grid. APC also has substantial interests in seven distribution utilities \nserving a total of 18 cities and municipalities in Central Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, with a \ncustomer base of 766,988 in 2014. The company is listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange. For \nthe year ending 31 December 2014, APC reported revenues of P86.8 billion, net income of P18.1 \nbillion, and assets of P216.8 billion. APC is the Philippines\u2019 leading hydro developer and its \nsecond  largest  geothermal  operator.  Over  a  third  of  the  company\u2019s  attributable  capacity  is \nrenewable energy; development of additional renewable energy projects is a core strategic focus \nof the company. \n \n13.  APC\u2019s  controlling  shareholder,  Aboitiz  Equity  Ventures,  Inc.  (AEV),  is  a  diversified \nconglomerate listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange. AEV has interests in the electric power, \nfinancial services, and real estate sectors, among others. As of March 2014, AEV owns 76.9% of \nthe sponsor\u2019s capital stock. For the year ending 31 December 2013, AEV reported revenues of \nP90.9 billion, net income of P21.0 billion, and assets of P247.1 billion. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n14.  Impacts \n \n(i)  Development of the private sector bond market in the Philippines. ADB\u2019s \ncredit enhancement will support the issuance of the Philippines\u2019 first green project \nbonds denominated in pesos. If project bonds are deployed at greater scale, they \ncan supplement the bank financing market mobilizing long-term financing from \nlocal  institutional  investors  for  the  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  and \ninfrastructure agendas. The project will also represent an early milestone in the \ndevelopment of a nascent green bond market by seeking third-party certification in \naccordance with the climate bond standard. \n ", "4 \n \n(ii)  Support investment in geothermal power in the Philippines. By demonstrating \nthat geothermal power can be financed on a nonrecourse project finance basis, \nthe project will indirectly support further investment in greenfield and brownfield \ngeothermal power generation and other renewable energy projects. In so doing, it \nwill help achieve the government\u2019s objective to diversify the country\u2019s energy mix, \nincrease energy security, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n15.  Outcome. The outcome is demonstrated viability of green project bonds for renewable \nenergy in the Philippines. The project supports the debt recapitalization of an existing project \nthrough bonds, thereby deepening capital market development in the country. As this represents \na new asset class, local institutional investors will require confirmation that such green project \nbonds can be implemented successfully.  \n \n16.  Outputs. The outputs are (i) successful introduction of Tiwi\u2013MakBan green project bonds \nfor geothermal energy, and (ii) achievement of green bond status and submission of application \nfor climate bond certification. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n17.  Consistency with  Strategy  2020  and the  Midterm  Review of  Strategy  2020. The \nproject is consistent with Strategy 2020 and the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which list \ninfrastructure, the environment, and finance sector development as three of ADB\u2019s five core \nareas.7 For finance sector development, the project advances goals of developing new products \nand  deepening  capital  markets  to  channel  national  savings  productively.  In  terms  of \ninfrastructure,  the  project  supports  clean  energy  and  private  sector  engagement.  For \nenvironment, it reinforces ADB\u2019s support to the Philippines in pursuing a low-carbon path for \neconomic growth. \n \n18.  Consistency  with  the  country  strategy.  Among  the  main  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for the Philippines are private sector development, reduced environmental \ndegradation, and vulnerability to climate change. The project supports each pillar. It is also in line \nwith ADB\u2019s programs to increase investment in infrastructure through PPPs, and to increase the \navailability of long-term finance to fund infrastructure investment.8 \n \n19.  Consistency  with  the  Energy  Policy.  The project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy \nPolicy, which emphasizes support for renewable energy in DMCs.9 \n \n20.  Consistency with the Financial Sector Operational Plan. The plan recognizes that the \nAsia and Pacific region\u2019s capital markets require the participation of institutional investors to \nmobilize long-term savings for infrastructure development. The plan also supports the promotion \nof debt capital markets, including local currency bonds, and ADB\u2019s use of innovative financing \nmechanisms such as credit enhancements to enable the financing of infrastructure. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2008.

Project Cost and Financing Plan \n21.  The  project  consists  of  assets  of  P30.5  billion,  including  power  plant  and  related \nequipment purchased in 2009 from the government at public auction, as well as subsequent \ninvestments in rehabilitation works. \n \n22.  Debt of up to P12.5 billion will be raised in two tranches: \n \n(i)  Project bonds. Up to P10.7 billion in local-currency nonrated project bonds will be \nsold to institutional investors. The bonds will have a tenor of up to 10 years, and \nwill be partially guaranteed by ADB (para. 24). \n(ii)  Loan. Up to P1.8 billion (or its dollar equivalent if pesos are unavailable) of project \nloan from ADB, with a tenor of up to 5 years, which will complement the bond pari \npassu. \n \n23.  The debt will be utilized to normalize the capital structure and support ongoing operation \nand maintenance. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n24.  The assistance will comprise: \n(i)  Partial  credit  guarantee.  ADB  will  cover  up  to  75%  of  scheduled  principal \npayments of the up to P10.7 billion 10-year nonrated senior secured project bonds \n(equivalent with up to P8.025 billion at issuance) plus interest thereon. The bond \nwill be labeled a green bond and is anticipated to be certified under the climate \nbond standard.10 \n(ii)  Loan. ADB will provide a limited recourse direct senior secured loan of up to P1.8 \nbillion equivalent (or its equivalent in dollars if pesos are unavailable), at a fixed \nrate, with a tenor of up to 5 years. The loan will be pari passu with the bonds and \nsecured by the assets of the project to the extent practicable and available under \nPhilippine law. ADB will procure pesos through cross-currency and interest rate \nswaps. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n25.  The project is considered justified because it will: \n \n(i)  Apply ADB\u2019s skills in financial structuring toward establishing a new asset class in \nthe  Philippines\u2014peso-denominated  green  project  bonds\u2014and  supporting  the \ndevelopment of the Philippine capital market. The project will thereby demonstrate \nan innovative structure to access alternative sources of capital from institutional \ninvestors. \n(ii)  Create a green bond, and thereby promote the concept of environmentally themed \nbonds to DMCs and support knowledge transfer in climate finance. \n                                                \n10 ADB will engage a consultant to independently audit APRI\u2019s compliance with the climate bond standard and assist in \nthe company\u2019s application to the Climate Bond Initiative. Consultant and certification fees will be funded by ADB\u2019s \nRegional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  under  ADB.  2013.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory B for environment, and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \nThe potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified and effective \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated \nin the safeguard reports and plans. The institutional capacity and commitment of APRI to manage \nthe project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. While climate change risk \nhas been rated medium, as an existing facility it is not possible to make project design changes. \nThe facilities have in place effective operational procedures to respond to significant weather \nevents. \n \n36.  Environment. Since Tiwi and MakBan are existing geothermal power generation facilities, \nan  appropriate  external  expert  prepared  an  environmental  compliance  audit  report  with  a \ncorrective action plan in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. APRI, in coordination \nwith PGPC, is fully accountable for and in compliance with environmental compliance certificate \n(ECC) conditions on the existing generating and steam-field facilities transferred under its name \nin September 2009. Relevant national and international emission standards are being met. APRI \nhas adopted internationally recognized environmental and safety management standards and is \nin the process of seeking management system certification.11 An ongoing process of community \nengagement,  including  ECC-compliant  barangay  emergency  response  training,  ensures  that \npertinent information on Tiwi\u2013MakBan activities is fully disclosed and a functioning stakeholder \ngrievance mechanism is in place. The plants use a closed-loop system in which wastewater and \ncondensates are disposed through reinjection into injection wells fitted with leak-proof casings. \nSurface and drinking water monitoring results demonstrate compliance with national standards for \ndrinking water.12 As the PGPC steam field, an associated facility, is covered under the ECCs, it \nalso complies with relevant national environmental legislation. \n \n37.  The  environmental  compliance  audit  report  identified  some  information  gaps,  so  a \ncorrective action plan was developed to enhance the Tiwi\u2013MakBan Environmental Management \nand Monitoring Plan, including (i) clear delineation of the roles and responsibilities as per GRSC \nprovisions13 and (ii) conditions stipulated in the ECC agreed upon by APRI and PGPC. APRI and \nPGPC are developing joint operational guidelines to clarify roles and responsibilities for meeting \nthe monitoring and reporting requirements of government agencies. \n  \n                                                \n11 APRI  has  initiated  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  accreditation  for  ISO  9001  (quality \nmanagement system), ISO 14001 (environmental management system), and Occupational Health and Safety \nAdvisory Services 18001. \n12 As is common in geothermal areas, elevated levels of boron have been measured in groundwater. PGPC has \nsignaled its intent to request that the geothermal area in MakBan be designated as a non-attainment area for boron \ngroundwater, as provided in the Philippine Clean Water Act. \n13 GRSC (2003), Section 6.8, \u201cAll Government approvals (if any) required under applicable law to be maintained by the \nowner (PSALM, now APRI) in connection with, and which are material to, the generating facilities and by the \ncontractor (Philippine Geothermal, Inc., now PGPC) in connection with, and which are material to, the geothermal \nfacilities shall be obtained and at all times maintained, or caused to be obtained and maintained, by the relevant \nparty, in full force and effect and, where applicable, renewed and caused to be renewed by the relevant party at the \nrelevant time.\u201d ", "7 \n \n38.  Social safeguards. APRI will neither acquire additional land nor construct new facilities. \nThe project will finance the procurement of machinery and equipment needed in APRI\u2019s current \noperations. The Tiwi\u2013MakBan plant facilities are located on 1,011 plots leased by the Power \nSector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation to APRI. The leased premises have an \naggregate land area of 368 hectares (Tiwi) and 176 hectares (MakBan). APRI\u2019s rehabilitation \nactivities are largely completed, and only a few facilities still need improving. A social compliance \naudit report covering the leased premises has been prepared. APRI\u2019s current operations are \nunlikely to impact the informal dwellers within the leased premises. No indigenous peoples reside \nin the project areas, and APRI\u2019s operations do not interfere with or impact indigenous peoples\u2019 \nproperty or livelihoods. \n \n39.  Other social dimensions. APRI will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to \nADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.14 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its \ncontractors\u2019) compliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and \nconsultations with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. While \nthe project design has no direct impact on women and is categorized as having no gender \nelements, APRI implements corporate social responsibility programs that benefit both men and \nwomen in the community. APRI has 260 employees, of which 23% are women. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n40.  APRI was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n41.  The proposed guarantee and loan are within the medium-term, country, industry, group, \nand single-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n42.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),15 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of the \nPhilippines has no objection to the proposed assistance to APRI. ADB will enter into suitable \nfinance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n43.
