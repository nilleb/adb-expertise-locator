The  Government  of  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  has  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  an  integrated \nstructure for reforms to enhance revenue collection, including the prosecution of tax evasion, as \npart of the Government\u2019s overall fiscal consolidation effort. The ADB country strategy and \nprogram  (CSP)  for  the  Philippines  considers  fiscal  consolidation  through  tax  revenue \nenhancement and improved governance as key pillars of the development assistance strategy \nto the country. ADB fielded a Fact-Finding Mission in November 2007 to discuss and reach an \nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives and scope of the proposed TA, the terms \nof reference for consultants, and the cost and implementation arrangements. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n2.  The proposed TA complements and enhances ADB\u2019s ongoing activities in this area. \nUnder  the  Development  Policy  Support  Program  loan  (DPSP),  ADB  is  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal consolidation effort. Under an ongoing TA to the justice sector, ADB is \nassisting justice sector agencies strengthen their capacity to prosecute and adjudicate cases. 1  \nAt the request of the Government, ADB is also helping to prepare a process map to clarify \nperceived  impediments  to  the  successful  criminal  prosecution  of  the  Bureau  of  Internal \nRevenue\u2019s (BIR) \u201cRun after Tax Evaders\u201d (RATE) cases and develop recommendations to \naddress the impediments (process map).  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Enhancing  Revenue  Collection.  The  2005\u20132007  Philippine  CSP  highlights  fiscal \nimbalance as a binding constraint to higher sustainable growth. In recent years, the Government \nhas made excellent progress in fiscal consolidation, with the national Government deficit falling \nfrom 5.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003 to 1.1% in 2006. The deficit is expected to \nfall below 1% of GDP in 2007 this year, and the consolidated public sector budget to be in \nsurplus of about 0.1% of GDP. Tax policy measures implemented between November 2004 and \nFebruary 2006 resulted in a 20% increase in tax revenues in 2006 over 2005 levels, and helped \naddress the problem of fiscal sustainability. Consequently, the Government advanced its target \nof a balanced budget from 2010 to 2008. Additional reforms in taxation, rationalization of fiscal \nincentives, and tax administration will be necessary to achieve this target and ensure that the \nfiscal  adjustment  is  sustainable.  International  comparisons  of  tax  revenue-to-GDP  ratios \nsuggest that there is much upside potential for improving tax revenue performance in the \nPhilippines. \n \n4.  However, revenue performance in 2007 has fallen short of the 2007 budget target.  BIR \ncollection from January to August 2007 was up about 8% over the same period in 2006, but \nshort of the 2007 target of 14.8% increase over 2006 levels. The slowdown in tax revenue \ncollections this year is explained by several factors, including the removal of the 70% cap on \nvalue-added tax (VAT) credits that contributed to a drop in VAT collections in the first semester, \nappreciation of the peso exchange rate that lowered VAT collections on imported products, and \nthe prevalence of tax exemptions in the growth sectors of the economy that limited growth-\ninduced tax collection. Weak tax administration and inefficiencies in the tax policy indicate that \nBIR  has  been  unable  to  lift  tax  revenues  through  improvements  in  tax  efficiency  and \nenforcement.  \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Enhancing the Autonomy, Accountability \nand Efficiency of the Judiciary and Improving the Administration of Justice. Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  BIR\u2019s  Tax  Administration  Reform  Agenda.  In  2006  BIR  established  the  tax \nadministration reform group comprising senior management from BIR and the Department of \nFinance (DOF). A 4-year tax administration reform agenda and action plan was designed and \nimplementation  started  in  mid-2007.  The  action  plan  comprises  seven  priorities  including \ncleaning, expanding, and computerizing the taxpayer database; and implementing a risk-based \naudit  system,  improved  administration  and  collection  of  tax  arrears,  and  human  resource \ndevelopment. Several development partners are supporting different components of BIR\u2019s tax \nadministration  reform  agenda  (Appendix  2).  The  World  Bank  has  provided  an  $11  million \nprogram loan to support tax administration reforms, primarily computerization of regional tax \noffices  (RDOs).  In  addition,  BIR  is  implementing  programs  to  improve  the  detection  and \nenforcement of tax evasion. Several aid agencies are providing technical assistance to support \nthe  BIR\u2019s  RATE  program.  ADB  is  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  tax  policy  reform  agenda \nthrough its DPSP-1 loan, with an expanded role under DPSP-2, active participation in the \nGovernment-donor group on tax reform, and preparation of the tax prosecution process map.   \n \n6.  National Risk-Based Audit System and Industry Tax Performance Benchmarks. \nThe Government is committed to implement a risk-based audit system necessary for effective \ntax enforcement and revenue enhancement over the long term. At the same time, BIR will \ncontinue to expand its industry tax performance benchmarks to identify taxpayers in a particular \nindustry for inspection and audit for suspected tax evasion. These benchmarks have proven to \nbe useful tools in detecting tax evasion and place pressure on large taxpayers to adhere to \nindustry norms.   \n \n7.  Inefficiencies in Tax Policy or Legislation. The Government provides numerous tax \ndeductions, exemptions and credits for VAT, customs duties, corporate and individual income, \namong others. In addition, several tax regulations and policies create investment distortions in \nseveral sectors such as the banking and financial sector. The structure of excise taxes and their \nadministration has also affected excise tax collections, especially in alcoholic and tobacco \nproducts.  Consequently,  excise  tax  collections  have  not  grown  in  line  with  growth  in  the \nconsumption of such products.  \n \n8.  Inadequate Tax Revenue Forecasting Capacity. DOF analysis shows that tax revenue \ngrowth does not track GDP well. The reasons for this are unclear. In any case, that fact has \nhampered  DOF\u2019s  capacity  to  forecast  tax  revenues  necessary  for  formulating  the  national \nGovernment  budget  and  medium-term  expenditure  plan.  DOF  does  have  a  program  for \nforecasting revenues, but this model is considered outdated, may not properly account for \nvarious exemptions, and is not integrated with sources of economic growth (such as the input-\noutput table). Forecasting tools require upgrading.  This is critical not only for setting revenue \nand therefore spending targets in the budget, but also as one way to benchmark against actual \ncollections.  \n \n9.  The  RATE  Program.  BIR,  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  through  the  National \nProsecution Service (NPS), and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) are the key actors in the \ncriminal prosecution of tax evasion cases. Until recently, criminal prosecution of tax evasion has \nnot been a primary objective of BIR operations; the focus had been on taxpayers\u2019 voluntary \npayments, which account for the bulk of BIR collections.  Recently,  BIR has begun to focus on \ncriminal prosecution of tax evasion. In March 2005, BIR established the RATE program, which \nfocuses on detecting tax evasion and preparing cases to submit to DOJ for prosecution. RATE \ncases are resource-intensive and require BIR to make a determination that sufficient evidence is \n ", "  3\navailable to prove before DOJ that probable cause exists against an alleged taxpayer, that the \ntaxpayer \u201cprobably\u201d committed the violation.2 \n \n10.  BIR Capacity Building. The focus of the RATE program has been on the filing of RATE \ncases. As of 31 August 2007, BIR had filed 87 RATE tax evasion complaints with DOJ, involving \nan estimated tax liability of P6.39 billion. Six complaints have progressed to the filing of criminal \ncharges in  CTA.  BIR staff responsible for preparing and prosecuting RATE cases are receiving \ntraining and equipment under the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) fund to strengthen \ntheir capacity in this area. However, the RATE program has not yet been institutionalized within \nBIR\u2015there is no separate office, permanent staff, nor a separate budget. The absence of an \ninstitutionalized framework undermines efforts to build a long-term capacity to prepare and \nprosecute RATE cases. DOF is planning to institutionalize the RATE program under DOF\u2019s \nproposed rationalization program, which has been submitted to the Department of Budget and \nManagement for approval.  \n \n11.  Delays in Prosecuting RATE Cases.  Currently, of the 87 RATE complaints filed with  \nDOJ, 35 have been resolved by DOJ (13 in favor of BIR with a finding of probable cause, 18 \nhave been dismissed, and 4 have been remanded or referred back to BIR).  Seventy-eight \ncases remain part of the DOJ caseload. Delays in DOJ\u2019s handling of cases, including RATE \ncases, arise from the problems facing DOJ as a whole, e.g., the absence of formal training on \ntrial  techniques  for  new  prosecutors,  the  large  caseloads  of  prosecutors,  including  those \nassigned  to  a  Special  DOJ  or  BIR  Taskforce,  deficiencies  in  physical  resources  and \nadministrative systems that would make prosecutors more productive, and the absence of a \nuniform approach to case flow management and performance management. Delays in the \nhandling  of  RATE  cases  can  also  be  specifically  attributed  to  capacity  constraints  in  this \narea\u2015DOJ  lawyers,  while  proficient  in  prosecuting  criminal  cases,  do  not  have  sufficient \nexperience or background in tax laws. Since DOJ resolutions set a trend in future rulings on \ncases  submitted  for  preliminary  investigation  and  define  the  standards  for  BIR  case \ndevelopment, there is a critical need for capacity development. In addition, there is no existing \ndatabase  of  DOJ  resolutions  issued  after  preliminary  investigations  of  criminal  complaints, \nincluding RATE complaints, that could help ensure consistency in the resolution of cases filed \nby BIR for preliminary investigation and provide BIR with a preview of how future cases will be \ndecided by DOJ.  Such a database would also help in monitoring complaints that have been \ndismissed for lack of a probable cause. \n \n12.  Tracking the Status of RATE Cases. In addition, there is currently no effective means \nof monitoring, evaluating, and managing DOJ prosecutors or tracking the status of all criminal \ncases, including RATE cases, that they are prosecuting. There is no system for promptly \nproducing reports on the status of cases, without significant effort. Monthly reports are compiled \nand submitted in hard copies, relying on information gathered manually from docket books and \nother records. In 2007, DOJ introduced a transitional reporting system for prosecutors that \nintroduced  standard  reporting  formats  on  end-of-year  pending  caseloads  and  period \naccomplishment  reports  reviewing  the  disposition  of  cases.  The  system  is  currently  being \nenhanced with support under an ADB TA (footnote 1). However, since the system is dependent \non paper collection and manual compilation of figures, progress in implementing it has been \nslow. DOJ plans to develop an information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure \nand to maximize the use of existing ICT for collecting standard data. In the 2007 budget, DOJ \nrequested additional funds to enable it to begin to procure the necessary ICT infrastructure \n(desktop computers for prosecutors and associated infrastructure to link them to a common \n                                                 \n2  In contrast, the standard of proof needed to obtain a conviction for tax evasion is \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d \n(there is no doubt that the taxpayer committed the violation).  \n ", "4   \nnetwork). Improvements to this system would help in the quick resolution of RATE complaints \nand improve oversight over prosecutors prosecuting RATE cases.  \n \n13.  Capacity  Building  at  the  Court  of  Tax  Appeals.  CTA  only  recently  acquired \njurisdiction over criminal tax cases, including RATE cases. Prior to this,  CTA only had appellate \njurisdiction over civil and criminal cases decided by the lower court and appeals from BIR tax \nassessments.  Currently only six RATE cases have been filed with CTA and no judgments have \nbeen issued. Novel legal issues are predicted with the rise in the number of tax evasion cases \nfiled with CTA.  The first few decisions that CTA will promulgate on tax evasion cases will be \nsetting a precedent. They will define the direction of DOJ in handling preliminary investigations \nof tax evasion cases and provide guidance to BIR in deciding which tax evasion cases to \ndevelop. This prospect, together with the fact that CTA justices are not familiar with criminal \nprocedure, makes CTA capacity enhancement critical.  \n \n14.  Aid Agency Support for CTA and DOJ in the Prosecution of RATE Cases. The \nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Rule of Law project, \nhas been assisting CTA to develop and implement a case flow management information system, \nand is providing training to CTA justices on tax evasion adjudication. Under the Rule of Law \nproject, USAID is currently in discussions to help DOJ prepare a prosecutors manual that would \ninclude, among others, guidance on prosecuting RATE cases; and is also supporting NPS to \ndevelop  a  case  management  system  for  criminal  cases,  including  RATE  cases.  The  Asia \nFoundation is in discussions with DOJ to help implement DOJ\u2019s new capacity development \nprogram, prepared with ADB assistance.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The TA will support enhanced tax revenue collection. The proposed TA outcomes are an \nimproved tax policy and strengthened criminal prosecution of tax evasion. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA activities are divided into two components: \n \n(i)  Component 1: Tax revenue enhancement. This component will support the \nGovernment\u2019s agenda to implement sustainable revenue enhancing measures \nand broad tax policy and administration reforms. Activities in this component \ninclude the following:  (a) drawing on international best practices, assess the \ndesign  and  structure  of  excise  taxes  and  their  administration,  and  give \nrecommendations for strengthening the excise tax regime; (b) provide a series of \ntechnical background papers on improving efficiency and administration of other \ntaxes (VAT, income taxes), determined in consultation with DOF; (c) carry out tax \nperformance benchmarking for two major industries; and (d) evaluate DOF\u2019s \ncurrent tax revenue forecasting models and assist DOF in upgrading tax revenue \nmodels integrated with national income accounts and the input-output tables.  \n \n(ii)  Component  2:    Strengthen  criminal  prosecution  of  tax  evasion.  This \ncomponent focuses on strengthening the criminal prosecution of tax evasion \nthrough capacity building, enhancing institutional linkages between BIR and DOJ, \nand  case  performance  monitoring.  Key  activities  include  the  following:  (a) \ndevelop and implement an internal database at NPS to consolidate and share \n ", "  5\ninternal  probable  cause  rulings  and  decisions  on  RATE  cases,  and  related \ntraining and a framework for monitoring the use and impact of such database in \nterms of consistency and predictability of rulings; (b) build the capacity of NPS \nand BIR prosecutors, including the provision of research and resource materials;  \n(c)  build  the  capacity  of  CTA  justices  on  criminal  tax  evasion  by  providing \nresource materials and related training; and (d) enhance processes, procedures, \nand  systems  to  enable  tracking  of  tax  evasion  cases  at  NPS,  a  related \nperformance measurement system.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program.  The Government will provide in-kind \ncontribution equivalent to $100,000 by providing counterpart staff, office space and utilities, \nadministrative services, and physical facilities. Appendix 3 gives the detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  DOF will be the Executing Agency and BIR, NPS, and CTA will be the implementing \nagencies (IAs). DOF will form a steering committee comprising representatives from the IAs to \noversee TA implementation.  \n \n19.  A team of international consultants paired with national consultants will be engaged to \nimplement the TA activities. The consultants will be hired individually or through a firm by ADB \nthrough consultant qualification selection (CQS), according to the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (April 2007, as amended from time to time). All payments under the Project will \nconform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007 as amended from time to time). The TA will \nrequire 15 person-months of international and 28 person-months of national consulting services \n(5 international and 5 national consultants). Each component will be considered a stand-alone \ncomponent. The TA is expected to be implemented over 12 months, from January 2008 through \nDecember 2008. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n20.  The consultants will be responsible for providing reports and deliverables as required \nunder their terms of references. Each component will produce a final report on activities. The \ntiming of each TA activity will be determined in consultation with DOF and the relevant IA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof  the  Philippines  for  Enhancing  Revenue  Collection  and  Strengthening  the  Criminal \nProsecution of Tax Evasion Cases, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact  Increased tax revenues to  Tax data from DOF  Assumption \nEnhanced tax  GDP ratio by 0.25-0.30% in  \u2022  High economic growth \nrevenue collection.   2008 and increased by 0.40%  rate continues \nin 2009   \n  Risk \n  \u2022  Strong vested interest \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Government stays on \nStrengthened criminal  Amendments to tax legislation  Taxpayer data from BIR  course with key tax \nprosecution of RATE  submitted to Congress in 2008    policy reform measures \ncases    and able to effectively \nIncrease in the quality of RATE  liaise with Congress \ncases filed by BIR with the  \u2022  Ongoing Government-\nNPS as measured by an  wide policy and \nincrease in the number of  commitment to \nRATE cases filed by NPS with  prioritize and bring \nthe CTA from 6 in 2007 to 12  RATE cases as a key \nby Dec 2008 to 30 by Dec  strategy to increase \n2009.  compliance with tax \nobligations \n \n Risks \n\u2022  Funding Constraints \n\u2022  Capacity constraints \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \nComponent 1:  Excise tax revenue collections  BIR or DOF revenue data  \u2022  High quality reports \nEnhancing Tax  increased in 2008 by at least  ADB Review Missions  and recommendations \nRevenues  the rate of growth in nominal    accepted by \n1.1 Administration of  GDP    stakeholders \nexcise taxes       \nstrengthened.
