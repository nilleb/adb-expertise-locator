INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Viet Nam has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  strengthen  the  institutions  that  manage  the  country\u2019s  water \nresources. The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2009\u20132011 for Viet Nam \nand is consistent with Viet Nam\u2019s country strategy and program, 2007\u20132010. The midterm \nreview  of  the  country  strategy  and  program  called  for  an  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM) approach to planning strategies and work practices with a strong focus on \ninstitutional development in conjunction with water resources infrastructure development.1 This \nfollows from the support provided under two earlier TA projects: (i) the Viet Nam Water Sector \nReview,  which  identified  key  water  management  issues  and  led  to  the  formulation  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s National Target Program (NTP) to improve the effectiveness of integrated use, \nmanagement, and protection of water resources;2 and (ii) the Second Red River Basin Sector \nProject,  which  assisted  the  government  with  a  review  and  revision  of  the  Law  on  Water \nResources (LWR).3  \n \n2.  An ADB project review mission for the Second Red River Basin Project, conducted 2\u201320 \nAugust 2010, identified the need for additional TA.4 This report is based on the understanding \nreached  with  the  government  regarding  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and outline terms of reference for the TA.5 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Viet Nam, a country not rich in water resources, will face numerous challenges in the \nfuture. Viet Nam has long dry seasons, and more than 60% of its water comes from other \ncountries. Some major rivers, including the Red\u2013Thai Binh river basin in northern Viet Nam, are \nstressed with inadequate flows of clean fresh water. Groundwater is contaminated by industrial \nwaste, pesticides and fertilizer used in agriculture, and aquaculture. However, Viet Nam has \nstruggled to implement sustainable resource management approaches, and the government \nhas failed to enforce the regulatory frameworks it has adopted.  \n \n4.  Legal and institutional arrangements are not clear and water rights are not defined, \nleading to conflict, inefficient and unsustainable investments, and stress on water resources. \nThe country has struggled to maintain or replace old and dilapidated infrastructure. Climate \nchange and the prospect of rising sea levels are complicating these serious challenges. The \n1998 LWR urgently needs updating to address the legal and institutional arrangements that are \nrequired.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Country Strategy and Program Midterm Review: Viet Nam, 2007\u20132010. Manila.  \n2  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Viet Nam Water Sector Review. \nManila (TA 4903-VIE, for $580,000, approved on 18 December 2006; and supplementary TA for $550,000, \napproved on 11 December 2008). \n3  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Institutional Development (Part A) of the \nSecond Red River Basin Sector Project. Manila (TA 3892-VIE, for $10.6 million, approved on 8 May 2002; and \ncomponent  5,  Review  of  the  Law  on  Water  Resources,  for  $681,000,  approved  on  27  June  2008  with \nsupplementary financing). \n4  The mission also reviewed the complex history of the institutional development component of the project. This and \nlessons from this experience will be elaborated in the project completion report, which is scheduled for preparation \nin the first quarter 2011.  \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 6 October 2010. \n ", "2   \n5.  IWRM includes the following features: (i) effective management and conservation of \nwater focused on efficient water use in all sectors to ensure a sufficient supply, (ii) a water rights \nframework,  and  (iii)  river  basin  plans  with  water  allocation  rules.  Improving  the  social \nenvironment and living conditions of people requires more and larger investments in water-\nrelated projects for pro-poor rural development, irrigation diversification, and stronger rural water \nsupply and sanitation.  \n \n6.  The government\u2019s approval and implementation of the NTP will be essential for the \nadoption of IWRM principles. The NTP covers the 13 main river basins in Viet Nam, but \nprioritizes three of them: (i) the Red\u2013Thai Binh river basin in the north, including the capital \nHanoi; (ii) the Dong Nai river basin in the south, including Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city and \ncommercial  center;  and  (iii)  the  Cuu  Long  (Mekong)  river  basin  in  the  far  south,  which \nencompasses the Mekong Delta. Together these three river basins account for 48% of the \ncountry's physical area and almost 70% of its population. They also produce about 70% of the \ngross domestic product and have more than 80% of the country\u2019s water resources.  \n \n7.  ADB has made considerable investments in water resources development in the Red\u2013\nThai Binh River Basin, including four loans with major irrigation and drainage components along \nwith institutional development initiatives.6 These initiatives have demonstrated the need to (i) \nstrengthen the capacity to develop the water resources sector further and ensure the success of \nfuture investments, and (ii) base project planning on a river basin development approach that \naddresses key constraints in an integrated manner. Successful capacity development projects \nfeature  thorough  project  preparation,  close  coordination  among  funding  agencies,  and \nadministration by the resident mission. \n \n8.  The TA is consistent with the draft assessment strategy and road map for the agriculture, \nnatural  resources,  and  environment  sector, 7  which  includes  natural  resources  and  the \nenvironment as one of its three major support areas. The TA will also add value to ADB's \nprogram  for  Viet  Nam  and  has  the  potential  to  strengthen  cooperation  with  international \ndevelopment  partners  supporting  the  development  of  the  country's  water  resources  sector \nthrough institutional and operational capacity development.8 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be better management and development of the water resources sector, \nincluding the adoption of an effective water resources development strategy and investment \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1993.

ADB led the initiative and coordinated \nparticipation and responses of a wider group of international development partners involved in the water sector. \n ", "  3\nprogram for the Red\u2013Thai Binh river basin by 2015. The outcome will be greater capacity of the \nMinistry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  (MONRE)  to  support  policy  initiatives  and \nimplement investment projects, including the government\u2019s endorsement and acceptance of a \nnew legal framework for water resources management by November 2011. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will support MONRE\u2019s adoption of IWRM principles through (i) continued support \nfor the revision of the LWR, and (ii) the establishment of planning tasks leading to a sector \nstrategy and investment program for the development of the Red\u2013Thai Binh river basin water \nresources.9 The main outputs will be the documents needed for the submission of the amended \nLWR by March 2011,10 and the planning tasks by June 2012. \n \n1.  Support for Preparation of Amended Law on Water Resources \n11.  Since February 2009, ADB has provided TA to support the review of the LWR (footnote \n3). The Government of the Netherlands also provided funding on a grant basis. That support will \nend at the end of October 2010. \n \n12.  MONRE must submit the amended LWR and all supporting documents to the National \nAssembly  by  March  2011.  This  TA  will  support  MONRE  over  the  5  months  between  the \nconclusion of the TA project that initiated the LWR review (footnote 3) and the submission of the \namended LWR at the end of March 2011. During that period, MONRE will (i) revise the draft \nLWR  to  address  stakeholder  comments  and  finalize  the  LWR,  (ii)  finalize  the  impact \nassessment report, (iii) complete the draft implementation decree, (iv) consult with stakeholders \non the draft LWR before finalization, and (v) complete the submission of all documents.  \n \n13.  A revised draft LWR has been prepared, which includes the following key features: (i) \nbetter planning to provide the foundation for good management and protection of the country\u2019s \nwater resources; (ii) water source protection and control over activities that degrade water \nresources;  (iii)  clearer  water  use  rights  and  more  efficient  management  of  water  use;  (iv) \nresponses to natural resource threats and damage caused by water; (v) information gathering \nand sharing; (vi) a wider range of economic instruments, including fees for the efficient delivery \nof  water  services,  charges  for  water  use  and  wastewater  discharge,  and  private  sector \ncontributions  to  infrastructure  projects;  and  (vii)  clearer  organizational  and  administrative \narrangements.  Without  continued  support  for  the  LWR  revisions,  ADB  and  MONRE  are \nconcerned that many of the innovations and key features proposed in the draft LWR may be lost \nor watered down as they are exposed to a broader range of stakeholders. \n \n2.  Planning Tasks for the Red\u2013Thai Binh River Basin \n14.  The government's NTP, which is in final stages of formulation and approval, will provide \nthe basis for international development partners working in water sector development, including \nADB, to prepare strategies and road maps for investment. The NTP presents the government\u2019s \nbroad strategy and a proposed program of investments for water resources development with \n                                                 \n9  Planning tasks are required by Article 12 of Government Decree 120/2008/N\u0110-CP, dated 1 December 2008, on \nriver basin management. They are also proposed in the draft amended LWR.  \n10 Including the final draft amended LWR, the final impact assessment report, and the final draft of the government \ndecree on implementation of the LWR. \n ", "4   \none of its highest priorities for the Red\u2013Thai Binh river basin.11 The government strategy and \nprogram of investments will need to be refined further before they are included in ADB\u2019s lending \nand nonlending program.  \n \n15.  The TA will support MONRE in addressing the planning tasks for the development of the \nwater resources of the Red\u2013Thai Binh river basin. The planning tasks will be undertaken before \nthe formulation of a detailed river basin plan as a rapid assessment to identify objectives, \npriorities, and general solutions for the basin; and to provide a framework and plan of activities \nfor managing water resources. In the Red\u2013Thai Binh river basin, this will involve a sector \nstrategy and investment program for the development of its water resources.  \n \n16.  The outcomes and targets for the river basin will not be exhaustive. Instead they will \nfocus on the outcomes that reflect the highest priorities and are good indicators of overall \nimprovement. Similarly,  targets  selected  will  be  those  that  are  most  likely  to  produce  the \ngreatest gains towards the outcomes in the short term. Achievement of the targets will allow \nMONRE to take a significant step in the process of continuous improvement. This will involve \nconsultation  with  the  community  concerned  and  an  assessment  of  social,  economic,  and \nenvironmental impacts over time. \n \n17.  The planning tasks for the development of the Red\u2013Thai Binh river basin will provide a \nframework plan of action and investment for managing water-dependent and water-impacting \nactivities in the river basin. They will be implemented by the provinces, ministries, and state \nmanagement agencies with interests in this river basin. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-IV). The TA is estimated to cost $650,000 equivalent with ADB contributing $580,000 \nand the government providing $70,000 equivalent. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The  executing  agency  will  be  MONRE,  which  will  implement  the  TA  through  its \nDepartment of Water Resources Management and provide office accommodation, counterpart \nstaff, and logistical support. \n \n20.  The TA will require about 54 person-months of consulting services, consisting of 14 \nperson-months international inputs and 40 person-months national inputs. It will be implemented \nover 20 months with an additional 3 months for TA closing. The consultants currently supporting \nthe LWR revision will be extended through the firm contracted for this purpose by single-source \nselection as the tasks involved are a natural continuation of their previous work.12 The firm\u2019s \nmain  role  under  the  TA  is  to  provide  the  same  six  consultants  (five  nationals  and  one \ninternational) to continue work on the revision of the LWR, which started in early 2009 and has \n                                                 \n11 The Red\u2013Thai Binh river basin is the largest in the country. It is home to one-third of the population, generates \nmore than 25% of gross domestic product, and accounts for about 26% of total irrigation water use in Viet Nam. \n12 The firm currently supporting the revision of the LWR is Kellogg Brown & Root of Australia. \n ", "  5\nproceeded effectively with their support.13 The outline terms of reference for consultants is in \nAppendix 3. \n \n21.  The consultants to be employed on the planning tasks will be recruited by individual \nconsultant selection. They will work closely with the Viet Nam Resident Mission\u2019s water team14 \nand will be able to draw on the expertise and in-house resources already available. \n \n22.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  ADB will manage the TA through its staff posted in the resident mission, which will allow \ncontinual communication and on-site monitoring of the TA project and the consultants\u2019 progress \nin carrying out their work. The project officer will meet frequently with MONRE to discuss \nprogress  and  attempt  to  ensure  effective  application  of  the  TA.  The  government  drafting \ncommittee will scrutinize the LWR outputs. The outputs related to the planning tasks for the \ndevelopment  of  the  Red\u2013Thai  Binh  river  basin  will  be  widely  circulated  for  comments  to \ngovernment agencies, international development partners, and ADB. \n \n24.  TA outputs, policy recommendations, and lessons learned will be disseminated through \n(i) seminars, workshops, focus groups, and conferences; (ii) consultations with international \ndevelopment  partners  and  civil  society;  (iii)  ADB's  water  community  of  practice;  and  (iv) \npublication of at least one knowledge product. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $580,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for Capacity Building for River Basin Water Resources Planning, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n13 The vice minister of MONRE has requested that the same consultants be extended for this work as a change in \npersonnel would be disruptive at this late stage in the process. Furthermore, MONRE and ADB have assessed the \nperformance of the firm and its consultants as highly satisfactory. \n14 The Viet Nam Resident Mission established its water team in October 2009 to provide a stronger policy-based \napproach to the formulation of ADB\u2019s program for the sector. The team has two international consultants (one \nurban water supply and sanitation specialist and one rural water supply and sanitation specialist), one national \nconsultant (regulatory framework specialist), and one national research assistant. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Reporting Mechanisms Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nBetter management  Central, provincial, and  National statistics and  The government is fully \nand development of  district government  NWRC reports  committed to a stronger \nthe water resources  cooperating more  legal framework. \nADB review missions \nsector  effectively to manage the \nand evaluations  The government will \nwater resources sector by \napprove the NTP to \n2015 \nimprove the \nAdoption of improved    effectiveness of \ndevelopment strategy for  integrated use, \nwater resources sector  management, and \ninvestments in the Red\u2013 protection of water \nThai Binh river basin by  resources. \n2015 \nRisk \n \nLack of cooperation \n    between ministries and \nconsensus on key \npolicy directions \nOutcome      Assumptions \nGreater capacity of  Government\u2019s  National statistics and  The National Assembly \nMONRE to support  endorsement and  NWRC reports  will approve the \npolicy initiatives and  acceptance of new legal  amended LWR in \nAmended LWR \nimplement investment  framework for water  November 2011. \nprovisions reflected in \nprojects  resources management by \nagency and government  The government will \n2011 \ninvestments and project  endorse the sector \n  reports  strategy for the \ndevelopment of the \nImplementation of legal  National and provincial \nRed\u2013Thai Binh river \nframework started  planning and investment \nbasin. \ndocuments \nRisks \n  ADB review missions \nand evaluations  The amended LWR will \nnot be comprehensive \nenough to cover all \naspects of the NTP\u2019s \nimplementation. \nLack of agreement \nbetween ministries \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Support for Preparation of Amended Law on Water Resources \n1.  Background \n2.  The implementation of this TA output will require the services of one international and \nfive  national  consultants.  The  consultants  currently  supporting  the  LWR  revisions  will  be \nextended through the firm contracted for this purpose by single-source selection as the tasks \ninvolved are a natural continuation of their previous work. The consultants will work closely with \ntheir counterpart staff in the Department of Water Resources Management (DWRM), and with \nthe LWR editing team and steering committee set up by the Ministry of Natural Resources and \nEnvironment (MONRE). This output will require 1.8 person-months of international consultant \ninputs and 25 person-months national consultant inputs.  \n \n3.

Planning Tasks for the Red\u2013Thai Binh River Basin  \n1.  Background \n5.  The output will be the production of planning tasks for the Red\u2013Thai Binh river basin, \nsetting out a strategy and investment plan for the basin. Planning tasks are based on existing \nknowledge  and  understanding  (no  additional  research  or  major  data  collection  will  be \nundertaken). They will concentrate on high-level issues, outcomes, and solutions. The planning \ntasks will: \n(i)  Identify  agreed  objectives\u2014what  are  the  broad  outcomes  that  river  basin \nplanning should achieve? \n(ii)  Identify priorities for activities\u2014what are the key areas in which management \nactivities are required? This may be in water allocation, pollution treatment, flood \nmitigation, protection of the stability of the river channel structure, or groundwater \nmanagement for a specified area. \n(iii)  Propose general solutions\u2014what needs to be done to achieve the objectives? In \nsome cases, these may require the development of a component plan for a river \nor a groundwater area. In others, the solutions may be more general, such as the \nneed for a community awareness campaign or for capacity building. \n \n6.  The planning tasks will provide clear directions for all water management in the river \nbasin, including the need to create component plans addressing \n(i)  water allocation, \n(ii)  water source protection, and \n(iii)  management of natural hazards (including flooding). \n                                                 \n2  A draft of the implementation decree must be submitted to the National Assembly at the same time as the LWR. \nThis will detail how the provisions of the LWR will be implemented. As such, it is an important document that will \nhelp the National Assembly understand the provisions. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n \n7.
