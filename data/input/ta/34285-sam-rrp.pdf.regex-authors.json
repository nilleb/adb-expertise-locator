The Project is \nAssessment  unlikely to have adverse environmental impacts. \nProject   The Project will help the Government continue its efforts to ensure that \nDescription  school education (grades 1\u201313) enhances equitable learning outcomes to \n  prepare competent young people for further study, work, and adult life. \nThe  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  education  policies  and  the \nStrategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa,  2005\u20132007,  which  identifies \nimprovements in learning achievement of primary and secondary students \nto ensure functional literacy as a national priority goal. The Project will \nimprove quality of learning for primary and secondary school children. \nCurriculum  for  all  subjects  from  years  1  to  8  will  be  improved.  New \nmultimedia methods will be developed for teaching science subjects in \nyears 9 to 13. All primary teachers will receive training in the use of the \nnew curriculum and assessment system. School environments of selected \nsecondary schools in rural areas will be upgraded to national standards.  \n \nThe Project has five components: (i) introducing curriculum reform and \nassessment  systems;  (ii)  developing  effective  teachers;  (iii)  improving \naccess  to  quality  education;  (iv)  strengthening  capacity  to  undertake \nresearch, evaluation, policy analysis, and planning; and (v) strengthening \ncapacity to implement and manage development projects. The Project is \ndesigned to establish a learning environment that provides all children \nwith an equal opportunity to learn at a higher level, while increasing the \ncost-effectiveness  of  service  provision.  The  Project  will  contribute  to \neliminating inequity by minimizing regional disparities in access to quality \neducation, and promoting equitable learning outcomes. Improving access \nto  quality  primary  and  secondary  education  in  poor  communities  is \nexpected to reduce income deprivation and hardship.  \n \nRationale  Despite many positive achievements in education since 1995, the quality \n  of education as measured by test results and functional literacy remains \ndisappointing. The Samoa primary education literacy level one (year 4) \nand two (year 6) tests, which assess students at risk of not reaching \nliteracy and numeracy standards, as well as year 8 examinations, indicate \nunsatisfactory results. For example, in year 4, students at risk in English \nincreased from 29% in 1997 to 51% in 2003; in year 6, students at risk in \nnumeracy increased from 63% in 1997 to 71% in 2003. In year 8, raw \nscores in all five subject areas tested declined. At the secondary level, \nscores on the year 12 examination in the 15 subject areas declined over ", "ii \nthe 5 years between 1997 and 2002, although they increased in most \nsubjects in 2003. Although questions may be asked about the reliability, \nvalidity, and suitability of these tests to accurately measure changes in \nstudent  performance  over  time,  fundamental  problems  are  affecting \nschool education in Samoa. These include low capacity to provide high-\nquality  learning  opportunities  and  learning  environment  in  government \nschools, and ensure these are available to all students, and are delivered \nefficiently. In addition, a large number of students enrolling in primary \neducation do not complete the 8-year program. Dropout and repetition \nrates are high, indicating inefficiency in the school system.  \n \nWhile upgrading of primary schools is supported by European Union and \nJapan International Cooperation Agency micro projects, no such financing \nis available for upgrading and rehabilitating secondary schools in rural \nareas. While the education sector is an explicit budget priority, available \nresources  are  often  not  managed  cost-effectively.  In  recent  years, \nfinancing of basic and secondary education has decreased, which may \nhave contributed to the decline in performance levels. The Government\u2019s \neducation  policy  development  unit  is  weak,  and  needs  substantive \ncapacity building in making sound policies for managing service delivery \neffectively.  \n \nThe Project addresses several priority areas in education service delivery. \nThe conditions of learning are unsatisfactory especially in disadvantaged \nareas. Textbooks are not always available in the quantities required, the \nprimary curriculum is over 25 years old and is not integrated with the new \nsecondary curriculum, and many teachers are unfamiliar with effective \ninstructional  practice.  A  new  secondary  school  curriculum  has  been \nadopted, but teachers need training and technical support to implement it \nand adopt new teaching methods in the classroom. External support has \nbeen mainly through projects, but coordination of externally assisted and \nGovernment-funded  programs  has  often  been  poor.  The  Project  will \ncontinue  and  complement  support  initiated  under  the  first  Education \nSector Project (ESP I) and other externally funded projects to address \nthese  issues,  and  focus  on  effective  coordination  through  the \nGovernment\u2019s leadership.  \n \nImpact and  The Project supports the establishment of a more equitable and effective \nOutcome  education system that enhances learning outcomes of young people for \n  further study, work, and adult life. The specific outcome will be enhanced \nquality of education by improving the curriculum; assessment; learning \nmaterials; teaching practice; and equitable access to trained teachers, \nfacilities, furniture, and equipment. The Project will focus on the gaps in \neducational service provision for children from disadvantaged areas. It will \nspecifically target secondary schools in rural areas not supported by the \nESP  I,  and  provide  systemwide  support  for  enhancing  equity,  quality, \nrelevance, and efficiency of service delivery for primary and secondary \neducation. \n \nThe Project will align the financial contributions and engagement of three \ndevelopment partners: the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Australian ", "iii \nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  and  New  Zealand \nAgency for International Development (NZAID), with a Government-led \nsector  development  program.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \ndesigned  to  promote  greater  local  ownership,  alignment  with  local \nsystems, and aid harmonization as agreed in the Paris Declaration on Aid \nEffectiveness 2005. These arrangements will have a longer term outcome \non sustainable capacity building.  \n \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $30.00 million equivalent. Of \nthis amount, the foreign exchange cost is estimated at $19.92 million \nequivalent  (66.4%),  and  the  local  currency  cost  at  $10.08  million \nequivalent (33.6%). \n \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a loan of $8.06 million equivalent, or 26.8% of the total \n  project cost. The loan will finance $6.28 million equivalent of the foreign \nexchange cost (31.5%) and $1.78 million equivalent of the local currency \ncost (17.7%). AusAID and NZAID will each provide grant cofinancing of \n$8.60 million equivalent (28.7% of the total cost). The grant cofinancing \nwill be partially administered by ADB and subject to ADB guidelines and \nprocedures for procurement of goods and services of consultants.

The loan will have a 32-year term including a grace period of \n  8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per annum and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter.  The  Project  will  finance  activities  in  the  education  sector \nthrough a project loan modality.  \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2013 \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012 \nCompletion Date \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance \nImplementation  The Project will be managed and implemented under a single framework. \nArrangements  The Implementing Agency will be the Ministry of Education, Sports, and \n  Culture (MESC). Strategic direction and oversight for the Project will be \nprovided by the Education Steering Committee. MESC will have overall \nresponsibility  for  day-to-day  management  of  project  implementation, \nmonitoring and evaluation, and reporting of progress. At the operational \n ", "iv \nlevel,  the  Project  will  be  managed  by  the  MESC  Core  Executive, \ncomprising  the  chief  executive  officer  and  assistant  chief  executive \nofficers, and supported by the Office of the Chief Executive Officer and a \nproject  coordinator.  All  elements  of  the  Project  will  be  implemented \nthrough  the  existing  MESC  organizational  structure.  Responsibility  for \neach component will rest with the appropriate assistant chief executive \nofficer and be implemented by staff of the relevant division.  \n \nThe project implementation structure for the Project aligns with the MESC \nstructure. The current project management team, established for the ESP \nI,  is  planned  to  become  an  integral  part  of  MESC\u2019s  organizational \nstructure as an assets management unit. It will have responsibility for \nprocurement of goods and services for all the components, and overall \nresponsibility for day-to-day coordination and management of component \n3 implementation, monitoring, evaluation of progress, and reporting to the \nMESC  Core  Executive  Group.  An  effective  project  management  and \nmonitoring system will be crucial to project implementation. Consulting \nservices will be provided to strengthen capacity of the Core Executive to \ndeliver  the  Project  and  future  development  projects  effectively  under \ncomponent 5.   \n \nProcurement  All goods and services financed under the Project will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s \nguidelines for procurement acceptable to ADB. The contract for MESC \nheadquarters estimated to cost more than $1,000,000 will be awarded \nfollowing ADB\u2019s international competitive bidding procedures. All the other \ncontracts under the Project will be awarded following local competitive \nbidding in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to ADB.  \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide about 122 person-months of domestic consulting \nand  103  person  months  of  international  consulting  services.  All \ninternational and associated domestic consultants will be selected and \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. All international consulting services will be provided by either \nfirms  or  individuals,  in  each  case  determined  by  MOF.  The  domestic \nconsulting  services  will  cover  all  services  except  for  the  project \nimplementation. The Project will use quality- and cost-based selection \n(QCBS)  method  for  recruitment  of  firms.  The  Project  will  provide \nconsultant  services  for  primary  curriculum  development,  assessment \nsystem,  information  communication  technology,  audio  visual  specialist, \nbilingual, primary subject area specialist, advocacy, pre-service and, in-\nservice  teacher  development,  public  opinion  assessment,  education \nequipment  procurement,  civil  works,  education  research  methods, \neducation  sector  expenditure  review,  education  sector  planning,  and \nproject management monitoring, and evaluation.   \nProject  Benefits  and  The Project focuses on systematic improvement in the quality of service \nBeneficiaries   delivery  through  improved  curriculum,  learning  materials,  assessment \n  systems, and teacher training. The long-term benefits will be derived from \nstronger  institutional  capacity  delivering  improved  learning  outcomes. ", "v \nAbout  40,000  primary  school  students  will  benefit  from  quality \nimprovements through the Project. Schools with a large number of pupils \nat risk of dropping out will be targeted. These interventions are expected \nto strengthen Samoa\u2019s human resources and provide an opportunity for \npoor people to participate in and benefit from development. \n \n  About  15,000  secondary  students  will  benefit  from  more  relevant \nmultimedia  learning  materials  in  science  and  agricultural  science. \nStudents on the islands of Savai\u2019i and Upolu will benefit from the services \nof  itinerant  design  technology  and  agriculture  science  teachers.  The \nschool environment of selected secondary schools and three colleges in \ndisadvantaged areas will be upgraded to the national standard. Offering \nrelevant, well-taught curriculum is an important incentive in attracting and \nkeeping  students  in  school.  Qualitative  system  improvements,  through \nrelevant curriculum and better learning environments, will result in higher \ntest results, and lower dropout and repetition rates. The existence of a \nhigh-quality  district  secondary  school  will  improve  primary  school \nparticipation and completion rates, and complement investments in parent \nand community advocacy campaigns.  \n \nMESC\u2019s capacity will be strengthened by improving staff\u2019s research and \nanalytical work, as well as their ability to generate reliable measurement \nindicators.  This  will  improve  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and  planning \ndevelopment  capacity  and  delivery  of  services.  The  Project  will  also \nstrengthen MESC\u2019s capacity in the day-to-day management, evaluation, \nmonitoring, and implementation of development projects.  \n \nRisks and  The  Government  is  highly  committed  to  ensuring  equity,  quality, \nAssumptions  efficiency,  and  relevance  in  education.  This  requires  more  resources \n  targeted at poor communities. However, political pressures may constrain \nthis  and  the  ability  to  rationalize  the  system  to  use  resources  cost-\neffectively. The development and implementation of appropriate policies \nto  use  resources  equitably  and  efficiently  is  required.  During  project \nimplementation,  dialogue  with  the  Government  will  seek  equitable \ndistribution and cost-effective use of resources. The Project does not \nforesee any major social risks, and will ensure benefits independent of \ngender and enhance equity by targeting low-performing schools.  \n \nSustainability risks include (i) insufficient recurrent budgets to finance \nnonsalary  recurrent  inputs,  especially  in  the  primary  and  secondary \nsubsectors; (ii) deterioration of facilities due to lack of maintenance; (iii) \nlow return of investments in teacher training due to attrition from the \nteaching force; and, (v) future underutilization of new secondary facilities \ndue to internal migration.  \n  \nTo  mitigate  risks,  the  Project  will  (i)  provide  substantial  support  to \nmaterials development, teacher training, and other quality enhancements \nas  a  bridging  strategy  to  provide  continuity,  while  assisting  the \nGovernment to develop an overall policy for the education sector and a \nfinancing framework that will assure adequate support to basic education \noperation  and  maintenance  costs  (reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s  next \n ", "vi \nEducation, Sports and Culture Policy and Strategic Plan, 2006\u20132014); (ii) \nsupport  development  of  policies  and  procedures  for  maintenance  and \nprotection  of  assets  (addressed  as  part  of  the  Education  Policy  and \nStrategic Plan framework); (iii) through technical assistance (TA) attached \nto the Project, build capacity for teacher development\u2014housing incentives \nmay attract and retain the teachers in the system and improvements in \nphysical work environments and the introduction of innovative teaching \ntechniques  will  improve  teacher  job  satisfaction;  and  (iv)  improve \nefficiency  by  rationalizing  school  provision.  ADB  will  continue  policy \ndialogue  for  rationalization  of  the  education  system  to  release  scarce \nresources, and will assist MESC in developing student flow and simulation \nmodels to ensure that investments in civil works are appropriately sited. \n \nTechnical  ADB will provide an additional $350,000 equivalent as a TA grant from the \nAssistance  ADB-funded  TA  program.  The  TA  will  establish  a  framework  for \ndeveloping  effective  approaches  for  teacher  development  programs \nessential for longer term sustainability of the project activities (Appendix 5 \nprovides  details  of  the  TA).  The  grant  will  cover  the  entire  foreign \nexchange cost of $281,000 and $69,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncost. The Government will contribute $100,000 equivalent to finance the \nremaining local currency cost.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) the proposed administration under the terms of partial administration by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia in an \namount not exceeding the equivalent of $8.60 million, and (iii) the proposed administration \nunder the terms of partial administration by ADB of a grant to be provided by the Government \nof New Zealand in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $8.60 million to the Government \nof  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  the  Education  Sector  Project  II.  The  report  also \ndescribes a technical assistance (TA) for establishing capacity for teacher development, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, will approve the TA. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITES \n2.  In 2003, the Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide TA1 to \nprepare a follow-on project to the Education Sector Project (ESP I).2 The Project is included in \nthe country strategy program update (2005\u20132006),3 which prioritizes investments in education \nas  an  important  means  of  addressing  hardship  in  Samoa.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is attached in Appendix 1. \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Samoa  became  independent  in  1962.  It  has  an  open  but  small  economy.  Gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita exceeds $1,400, and increased by 3.4% annually from \n1995 to 2002. Poverty is not regarded as a problem: private remittances from the 35% of the \npopulation living abroad are substantial (17% of gross national income) and the extended \nfamily system functions as an effective means of redistributing income. External aid represents \n14.5% of gross national income (2002). Samoa ranks fifth in the region on both indexes of the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme:  Pacific  human  development  index  and  human \npoverty index, and 75th worldwide on the human development index. Lack of opportunity and \nincome vulnerability, often exacerbated by external economic shocks and natural disasters, \ncontribute to hardship in rural areas, particularly in the island of Savai\u2019i. \n4.  Education is a high priority of the Government. Achievements include an adult literacy \nrate of 98.7%, the highest in the region. Virtually all children have access to primary education \nand almost 90% of grade 8 completers enter secondary education. Gender disparities have \nbeen eliminated at the primary level and are declining at the secondary. Samoa\u2019s first long-\nterm education development plan4 focused on equity, quality, relevance, and efficiency as \ncentral objectives. Past investments have given priority to (i) providing textbooks and learning \nresources for primary education; (ii) developing a new secondary curriculum and textbooks; \n(iii) improving facilities and equipment and teacher training; (iv) enhancing special needs \neducation; (v) expanding early childhood education;(vi) developing a bilingual language policy; \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

", "2 \nand (vii) strengthening the management capacity of the Ministry of Education, Sports, and \nCulture (MESC). Appendix 2 provides an analysis of the education sector.  \n5.  Yet, significant challenges persist. The Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2005\u2013\n2007 identifies improvements in primary and secondary education as a national priority goal. \nIncreased public expenditure on education development (4.5% of gross domestic product and \n15% of total government expenditures in 2002) does not yet provide the educational outcomes \nenvisaged. Almost 25% of students enrolling in primary education do not complete the 8-year \nprogram. In grade 1, 7% of students drop out each year and about 5% repeat. Repetition and \ndropout rates in grades 4 and 8 remain high. At the secondary level, about 70% of students \nentering grade 9 continue to grade 12, but less than half of 12th graders advance to grade 13.   \n6.  Variations in student learning achievement are significant. Student performance in \nprivate and mission schools is better than in government schools. Low retention and poor \nlearning is prevalent among students who are poor and live in rural areas. They are often \npoorly prepared when they enroll; the schools they attend do not offer quality opportunities to \nlearn; and their parents can only provide limited support and allow students to drop out when \nfacing difficulties. The result is that less than 25% of each age cohort completes 13 years of \neducation. Many others end their formal education poorly prepared for further learning or for \nwork.   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Quality learning opportunities are not available to all students. A recent review of the \neducation  sector  identified  several  issues:  (i)  poor  primary  curriculum  and  assessment \npractices,  (ii)  lack  of  competent  teachers  in  bilingual  education,  (iii)  limited  availability  of \ninstructional  materials,  (iv)  shortage  of  well-trained  teachers,  (v)  substandard  school \ninfrastructure in disadvantaged areas, and (vi) limited management capacity of MESC.   \n8.  Curricula, Teaching, and Assessment Practice. The primary curriculum is over 25 \nyears old. An updated curriculum policy framework and subject and year-level curriculum \nstatements  emphasizing  more  active,  child-centered  learning  activities  in  the  classroom; \nstrengthening  of  pedagogical  teaching  skills;  and  a  range  of  classroom  assessment \ntechniques are essential for high-quality teaching and learning. The Government intends to \ndevelop an integrated curriculum for primary years 1\u20133 and subject-specific curricula in seven \nsubject areas for years 4\u20138. Work is still needed to renew the primary curriculum; provide \nteachers\u2019 manuals, textbooks, and learning materials; and design related in-service training \nprograms. The Samoa primary education literacy level tests and the reported examination \nresults do not provide effective feedback on student performance on specific test items. A high \npriority is attaining a bilingual program, producing graduates fluent in Samoan and English.  \n9.  Competent  Teachers  in  Bilingual  Education.  The  medium  of  instruction  and \ncompetent  teachers  in  bilingual  education  are  major  issues,  as  a  high  level  of  English \ncompetence is required for success in examinations. Officially, all teaching in years 1\u20133 is in \nSamoan. In year 4, English is introduced. By year 7, all instruction is supposed to be primarily \nin English. At the secondary level, English is expected to be the language of instruction. In \nmany classrooms a mix of Samoan and English is used, mainly because teachers do not have \nenough competency in English to use English as a medium of instruction.  \n10.  Instructional Materials. The supply of learning materials is insufficient and largely \ndependent on aid projects. The MESC recurrent budget provides for reprinting of primary \nschool textbooks to ensure a new supply every 5 years. Toward the end of the 5-year period, a \nsevere shortage of textbooks occurs. Books are typically shared and students are often forced ", "3 \nto copy materials from the blackboard. Many primary teachers have been trained in more \nlearner-centered teaching and assessment methods, but the textbooks do not reflect such \napproaches.  The  new  curriculum  framework  (1\u201313)  requires  new  textbooks,  student \nworkbooks, and other learning materials. Moreover, supplementary materials such as readers \n(in Samoan and English) and audiovisual materials are in short supply. These shortages limit \nthe ability of teachers to implement instructional practices that new curricula call for, and limit \nteaching effectiveness.  \n11.  Teacher Shortage. Well-trained teachers with adequate skills to transmit knowledge \nand  manage  classrooms  are  in  short  supply.  Low  salaries  and  limited  opportunities  for \nprofessional development make attracting well-qualified secondary graduates into teaching, \nand then retaining them, difficult. The merger of the former Western Samoa Teacher Training \nCollege with the National University of Samoa (NUS) changed course offerings for preservice \ntraining. These changes have adversely affected the effectiveness of teacher development \nprograms as basic lesson planning and delivery skills do not receive adequate attention. In-\nservice  training  often  provided  by  aid-supported  projects  is  uncoordinated  and  lacks \nsustainability. At the secondary level, the anticipated growth in enrollment requires an increase \nin the output of the preservice programs with significant shortages expected in sciences, \neconomics, and accounting. Teachers also require training in the new curriculum. Quality \nimprovement initiatives are unlikely to succeed without in-service training, in-school support to \nteachers,  effective  monitoring  by  principals  and  school  review  officers,  and  cooperative \nprojects with NUS to effectively provide examples of good practices for the benefit of both pre- \nand in-service teacher education.  \n12.  Substandard School Infrastructure. Nearly every village has a primary school, jointly \nsupported by the Government and the community. Each district has a secondary school with \nthe bigger districts having two. Recent community consultations identified the condition of \nschool facilities as an important source of dissatisfaction. Although many primary schools and \nsome secondary schools have been upgraded in recent years, several schools in poorer areas \nstill operate in facilities that do not meet national standards. Schools have an acute shortage \nof desks and chairs. A system of preventive maintenance of the assets is required to protect \nthe investments.  \n13.  Capacity to Manage the System. The recently completed Institutional Strengthening \nProject, funded by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), worked to \nstrengthen MESC\u2019s capacity to manage the education system. The relatively sophisticated \neducation management information service developed provides detailed education statistics, \nbut they are not always effectively used. Only four research studies were conducted during the \nlast 10 years. The Policy, Planning, and Research Division of MESC prepared the Strategic \nPolicy, Research, and Development Projects Framework (October 2003) and Guidelines for \nManaging and Conducting MESC\u2019s Research Projects (2004). MESC now wants to involve \nexternal agencies in education research that is ethical and of high quality, respects cultural \nvalues, causes minimum disruption to students\u2019 learning, is of benefit to education in Samoa, \nand available to MESC.5 This provides the possibility of contracting out research, but the staff \nof the Policy, Planning, and Research Division will need training in designing, monitoring, and \nassessing  the  quality  of  policy  research  and  evaluation.  Policies  and  procedures  for \ndevelopment  planning  by  schools  and  communities  have  been  piloted,  but  need  to  be \nextended and supported by training and financial resources. School management committees \nhave  been  established,  but  their  roles  and  responsibilities  need  to  be  clarified  and  their \n                                                 \n5  MESC. 2003. Strategic Policy, Research, and Development Projects Framework; MESC. 2004. Guidelines for \nManaging and Conducting MESC\u2019s Research Projects. Apia, Samoa.  \n ", "4 \ncapacities  developed.  The  potential  of  information  and  communication  technology  in \nstrengthening the capacity of education sector management needs to be developed. \n14.  Equity, the Central Challenge. Issues of participation and quality are related to the \ncore issue of equal opportunities for all students to learn, and acquire the knowledge and skills \nspecified  in  the  curriculum.  Low  education  performance  is  closely  related  to  economic \nhardship. A World Bank study suggests that the likelihood of children from the lowest quintile \nof households reaching secondary education is low. Poor parents have difficulty paying school \nfees, especially at the secondary level. Poor students attend preschools less frequently and \nhave a home environment unable to support schooling. Thus, children of poor families perform \nless well in school and often drop out early.  \n15.  External Support and Lessons Learned. External funding concentrates heavily on \nthe education sector (Appendix 3) and the lessons to be learned from these interventions are \nsignificant (Appendix 4). AusAID, European Union, Japan International Cooperation Agency \nNew Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID), United Nations agencies, and \nothers have been involved in a number of education projects. Their funding has included \nimportant support for curriculum development, teacher training, instructional materials, and \ncapacity building. The European Union and Japan International Cooperation Agency have \nprovided  support  for  primary  school  construction.  ADB,  with  the  Government  and  school \ncommittees, has allocated $7 million for civil works, furniture, equipment, library materials, and \nteacher training as part of the ESP I. Twelve secondary schools and seven primary schools \nwere  rehabilitated  and/or  expanded.  Furniture,  equipment,  learning  materials,  and  library \nresources were provided, and secondary teachers trained in coordination with the NZAID-\nsupported Samoa Secondary Education Curriculum and Resources Project. The experiences \nof ADB and other funding agencies in Samoa have been positive, although uncoordinated \ninterventions and the short-term nature of projects weakened the overall impact. The key \nlesson of the experience is that well-targeted investments can improve the quality and equity \nof education provision, but effective implementation of these initiatives at the school level is of \ncentral importance and requires special attention. The Project was prepared in coordination \nwith the major funding agencies in the education sector to avoid duplication in efforts and \nmove toward a more comprehensive sector approach. This aligns with the harmonization \nprinciples contained in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness 2005.  \n16.  Government Priorities. The Government is committed to achieving Education for All \nand the Millennium Development Goals. The Government recognizes that quality improvement \nin education service provision, using a sector approach, is essential to achieve its long-term \nobjectives. To this end, it may need to review resource allocations to different education \nsubsectors, ensure that basic education is funded at the level necessary for achieving the \nEducation for All and Millennium Development Goal targets, and use resources with optimal \nefficiency. Measures need to be taken to rationalize the education system to release scarce \nresources for the operation and maintenance of schools. \n17.  ADB Strategy. ADB\u2019s education strategy in Samoa supports the Government\u2019s overall \nstrategies and reflects the Government\u2019s sector priorities. The Project has been formulated \nwithin the framework of the Government\u2019s economic and public sector policies. It will support \ninterventions that aim at improving access of disadvantaged children to quality schooling to \nenhance their education performance, which in turn will reduce hardship. It recognizes the \nimportance  of  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Government  to  design  and  implement \neducation programs and reforms. It intends to build on the progress that has already been \nrealized by the Government with the support of bilateral funding agencies and ADB. Although \nideally the Project should have been designed after the formulation of the Education, Sports ", "5 \nand Culture Policy and Strategic Plan, 2006\u20132014 (EPSP),6 the Project is based on priority \nareas  already  identified  in  the  SDS  and  the  EPSP.  Work  toward  developing  the  EPSP \nframework is well under way, and the design of the Project is flexible to incorporate any priority \nareas that are not yet addressed. ADB will continue its policy dialogue with the Government \nand support the development of a policy environment that prioritizes equitable opportunities to \nlearn. It will also continue dialogue on reforms in the education sector that would provide \nresources for operation and maintenance of schools.  \n18.  ADB  is  implementing  TA  for  the  Samoa  SchoolNet  and  Community  Access  Pilot \nProject.7 The TA is designed to improve the quality and efficiency of education by providing \naccess  to  global  information  through  improved  access  to  information  and  communication \ntechnology,  especially  in  rural  areas.  The  pilot  project  is  designed  to  demonstrate  the \napplicability of SchoolNet and community access, as well as improved teacher training and \nmaterials through distance learning.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The  Project  is  to  establish  an  equitable  and  effective  education  system  that  will \nenhance learning outcomes of young people for further study, work, and adult life. The specific \noutcome  will  be  enhanced  quality  of  education  by  improving  the  curriculum,  assessment \nprocedures,  learning  materials,  and  teaching  practice;  and  providing  equitable  access  to \ntrained teachers, facilities, furniture, and equipment. The Project will focus on bridging the \ngaps in educational service provision for children from disadvantaged areas by specifically \ntargeting secondary schools in rural areas not supported by the ESP I and other aid-assisted \nprojects. It will also support a major effort to strengthen the national capacity for education \nresearch  and  evaluation,  and  MESC\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  development  projects  and \nimplement policy reforms. \nB.  Outputs  \n20.  The Project has five components: (i) introducing curriculum reform and assessment \nsystems; (ii) developing effective teachers; (iii) improving access to quality education; (iv) \nstrengthening capacity to undertake research, evaluation, policy analysis, and planning;, and \n(v)  strengthening  capacity  to  implement  and  manage  development  projects.  Outputs  of \ncomponent 1 are (i) new primary curriculum, (ii) adequate supply of learning materials and \nteacher  manuals,  (iii)  community  partnerships  program,  (iv)  national  assessment  policy \nframework, and (v) new assessment systems.  For the second component, the outputs will be \n(i)  national  teacher  development  framework,  (ii)  increased  number  of  agricultural  science \nteachers, (iii) pre- and in-service training for new initiatives, (iv) development of a cadre of \ntrainers, and (v) continuous in-service teacher development and school-based support. The \noutputs of component 3 will be (i) improved secondary school facilities and a community \nlearning center, (ii) improved procedures and resources for school maintenance, (iii) pilot \nprovision of houses for teachers in rural areas, and (iv) construction of MESC headquarters. \nThe outputs of component 4 will be (i) improved national capacity for research and evaluation, \n(ii) analysis of the causes of low achievement and noncompletion, and preparation of a plan of \n                                                 \n6  The formulation of the next EPSP will be assisted by ADB TA grant funding and will be built on the findings of the \nADB-supported education sector study (ADB. 2004. Education Sector Study. Manila). \n7  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for Supporting the Samoa SchoolNet and \nCommunity Access Pilot Project. Manila (TA 4305-SAM for $600,000, approved on 19 December 2003). \n ", "6 \naction for follow-up, and (iii) strengthened MESC capacity for policy analysis and planning. \nThe  outputs  for  the  component  5  are  (i)  improved  strategic  program  management  and \ncoordination  of  implementation,  (ii)  integrated  financial  management  system,  and  (iii)  an \neffective project performance monitoring, evaluation, and reporting system.  \n \n  1.  Component 1: Introducing Curriculum Reform and Assessment Systems  \n \n21.  This component will ensure that all students have the opportunity to learn and acquire \nthe knowledge, skills, and attitudes specified in the national curriculum.  \n22.  New Primary Curriculum and Assessment System. The new curriculum and the \nrelated instructional materials will emphasize more active, child-centered learning activities in \nthe classroom, and assessment techniques essential for high-quality learning. The Project will \nsupport\u2014through the provision of consulting services and training\u2014the development of a \ncurriculum for years 1 to 8 that will support more effective instruction and be consistent with \nMESC\u2019s  bilingual  education  policy,  the  National  Curriculum  Policy  Framework,  and  the \nNational Special Needs Policy. A subject statement will be developed for each learning area. \nThese will integrate values articulated in the National Curriculum Policy Framework and assist \nstudents experiencing learning difficulties and those with special needs.  \n23.  Adequate Supply of Learning Materials and Teacher Manuals. The Project will \nimprove MESC\u2019s capacity for producing audiovisual learning materials. The development of \nsupplementary  readers  in  Samoan  and  English  is  an  important  objective  to  support \nimplementation  of  the  bilingual  education  policy;  the  Project  will  support  the  provision  of \nlearning  materials  and  teaching  manuals.  These  will  cover  a  range  of  topics,  which  will \nthematically link with other subjects in science, mathematics, social science, health, physical \neducation, and music, as well as the everyday lives of students. The curriculum review and \nrenew process will ensure that gender stereotypes, if any, are removed from the content of the \ntextbooks. A strategic plan will be developed to ensure that readers are constantly written and \nprepared. The Project will provide consulting services and training to support these activities. \nCurriculum support materials, in the form of teachers\u2019 manuals, will be developed and provide \nteachers with sequenced instructional activities related to each achievement objective. They \nwill be organized on a subject basis to support the scope and sequence of learning within each \nsubject and include integrated units where cross-curriculum learning is deemed logical and \nappropriate. Along with instructional activities, sample assessment tasks and student work \nsamples will assist in benchmarking student performance and help teachers to assess student \nprogress and growth.  \n24.  At the secondary level, an important priority is the introduction of multimedia methods \nfor  science  and  agricultural  sciences  education.  Currently  the  country  has  a  shortage  of \ntrained  secondary  teachers  in  mathematics,  physics,  chemistry,  biology,  and  agricultural \nscience. Although the teacher is the critical component in learning, students can still learn \nthrough means other than face-to-face instruction. New multimedia approaches for learning \nincluding  video,  learning  software  for  computers,  radio,  and  television  have  considerable \npotential  to  enhance  learning.  The  capacity  of  the  education  broadcasting  unit  will  be \ndeveloped through project-provided consulting services and training to prepare multimedia \nmaterials for science and agricultural science. In-service training will be conducted to introduce \nthe multimedia materials. Results will be evaluated, and if successful, production can be \nexpanded to other subject areas.  \n25.  National  Assessment  Policy  Framework.  The  introduction  of  a  new  primary \ncurriculum  and  expected  changes  in  the  way  students  move  to  further  education  and ", "7 \nemployment  necessitate  changes  to  the  examination  system.  The  assessment  and \nexamination policies and systems will be reviewed, including the purpose and continuing use \nof the year 8 examination; the assessment system will be reformed. A national assessment \npolicy framework will be developed to reflect current curriculum reforms including bilingual \neducation and allow the monitoring of progress in student learning over time. The current \nfunctions, administration structures, and processes of the assessment unit will be reviewed. \nThe national assessment policy framework will take into account proposed changes to the \nPacific secondary school certificate administration, introduction of a regional form 7, links to \npost-school recognition, and  work of the Samoa Qualifications Authority. The  Project  will \nprovide consulting services and training support. \n26.  Community  Partnerships  Program  for  Demand  Generation  and  Improved \nLearning Outcomes. The subcomponent will provide technical support for a home-school \nliteracy partnership for two pilot schools: in-service training on literacy leadership, and the \ndevelopment  of  the  Fagaloa  community  learning  center  program.  Activities  under  this \nsubcomponent will result in strengthened families and communities with high expectations and \nsupport for the learning of their family members, including those with special education needs. \nIt will result in a community learning center that encourages involvement, sparks interest, and \ndevelops community capacity.  \n  2.  Component 2: Developing Effective Teachers  \n27.  Teachers are at the core of efforts to improve the quality of education and the level of \nstudent learning. Of greatest importance are teachers\u2019 content knowledge, quality of their \npedagogical approaches, and effectiveness of the instructional support they receive at the \nschool itself. The objective of this component is to ensure that teachers implement the national \ncurriculum using effective instructional strategies. The Project's activities will be part of the \nbroader MESC efforts to improve teacher deployment and management by establishing a pool \nof relief teachers, experiment with itinerant teachers, introduce school-based monitoring of \nquality, and establish formal staff appraisal procedures.  \n28.  National  Teacher  Development  Framework.  TA  will  be  provided  to  develop  a \nnational teacher development framework (Appendix 5). This will provide the basis for a teacher \ndevelopment policy that replaces the current ad-hoc approach to pre- and in-service training \nwith one that is coherent, aims at continuous support for improving teachers\u2019 professional \nskills, and establishes an institutional capacity-building framework for the management of \nteacher development. The TA recommendations and outcomes will be taken up in several \nactivities of the Project. First, the TA recommendations on minimum standards for teacher \ncompetencies will (i) directly guide the design of the in-service teacher training planned in the \nProject; (ii) serve as a quality indicator for this activity; and (iii) assist the articulation of in-\nservice training with quality preservice training. Second, recommendations and guidelines to \nbe developed by the TA on management will enhance MESC capacity to engage with other \nstakeholders to better coordinate the production and supply of effectively trained teachers. The \nProject  will  support  activities  recommended  under  the  TA  findings  as  agreed  with  the \nGovernment.  \n29.  Increased  Number  of  Agricultural  Science  Teachers.  To  help  the  Government \naddress  the  severe  shortage  of  agricultural  science  teachers,  the  Project  will  support \nfellowships  for  a  2-year  fast-track  training  program  jointly  implemented  by  NUS,  Samoa \nPolytechnic, and University of the South Pacific. Upon graduation, the fellowship students will \nbe bonded as government teachers for 2 years. The Project will provide 10 agricultural science \nfellowships and consulting services to develop the training program \n ", "8 \n30.  Pre- and In-Service Training for New Initiatives. Teacher training for new initiatives \nis critically important to their successful implementation in the classroom. Most important will \nbe  training  primary  school  teachers  as  the  new  primary  curriculum  statements,  teacher \nmanuals, and learning materials become available in 2008\u20132010. The Project will prepare and \nsupport a detailed plan for new curriculum training.  \n31.  Development  of  a  Cadre  of  Trainers.  Well-prepared  teacher  trainers  to  provide \ntraining in subject-specific instructional strategies and to introduce content with which teachers \nare not sufficiently familiar are key to the in-service training strategy. The Project will support \nTA and training workshops for training trainers.  \n32.  In-Service  Teacher  Development  and  School-Based  Support.  Routine  teacher \ntraining is essential to bring about sustainable improvements in instructional practice. The \nProject  will  support  a  combination  of  training  programs  and  courses  to  improve  general \nteaching skills, provide subject cluster content training, and ensure school-based support for \nimproved teaching as a follow-up to the training. Every teacher will be exposed to in-service \ntraining for an average of 10 days a year.  \n  3.  Component 3: Improving Access to Quality Education  \n33.  Improved Secondary School Facilities and a Community Learning Center. The \nProject will support upgrading of nine secondary schools and three fully Government-funded \ncolleges.8 In addition, in one secondary school, Fagaloa School, the Project will finance the \nrefurbishment  of  existing  classrooms  into  specialist  rooms  and  make  this  school  a  pilot \ncommunity  learning  center.  The  center  will  promote  relevant  technical  skills  including \ninformation and communication technology, mathematics for regular students, second chance \neducation for out-of-school youth, and adult education. Consulting services support will be \nprovided  for  strengthening  the  project  management  team,  which  will  become  the  assets \nmanagement unit of MESC, to implement activities under this component. In each secondary \nschool, administrative and library blocks, science laboratories, design and textile workshop, \nand toilet blocks are required; in three cases, classroom blocks are required. School design \nand  construction  will  include  provision  for  full  access  facilities  for  physically  challenged \nchildren  to  attend  school.  Furniture,  equipment,  and  learning  material  packages  will  be \nprovided. Appendix 6 lists the schools to be upgraded.  \n34.  Pilot Provision of Houses for Teachers in Rural Areas. The feasibility of attracting \nteachers  to  rural  primary  schools  in  less  favorable  locations  will  be  tested  by  providing \nattractive housing in four villages where teachers in certain subject areas are in short supply. \nThe houses will be built within existing school compounds. The program will be evaluated at \nthe end of year 2.  \n35.  MESC Headquarters. The Project will support the design and construction of the new \nMESC headquarters at the Government\u2019s Malifa compound. The new building will enable \neffective operation of MESC to deliver quality education support services.  \n36.  Maintenance.  The  Project  will  finance  the  maintenance  costs  of  school  facilities \nupgraded under the Project, teachers\u2019 houses, and MESC headquarters; and develop new \npolicy and procedures for sustainable maintenance of school facilities.  \n                                                 \n8  These colleges are actually secondary schools, but fully funded by the Government. ", "9 \n4.  Component 4: Strengthening Capacity to Undertake Research, Evaluation, \nPolicy Analysis, and Planning  \n37.  This  component  will  focus  on  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  formulate  appropriate \npolicies to make the education system more effective, efficient, and responsive to clients\u2019 \nneeds. It is designed to (i) strengthen the national capacity for research and evaluation, which \nwill  provide  a  stronger  basis  for  evidence-based  policy  development;  (ii)  strengthen  the \ncapacity of MESC staff to analyze education data, identify priority issues for action, plan \nremedial interventions and policy reforms, and monitor implementation; and (iii) support a \nlearning-by-doing  capacity-building  strategy,  which  will  provide  national  staff  with  the \nopportunity to carry out research and evaluation studies, plan education reforms, and design \nremedial interventions with decreasing external technical support. Thus, an experienced group \nof national professionals will be available for MESC to call on for specialized technical work.  \n38.  Improved National Capacity for Research and Evaluation. The Project will support \nthe training of 30 staff of MESC, NUS, Samoa Polytechnic, and other institutions and agencies \nto expose them to the latest techniques in education research and analytical methodologies to \nstrengthen capacity and quality of education research. To give them the opportunity to apply \ntheir skills, the Project will finance five field studies. Priority topics identified are (i) evaluation \nof the effectiveness of teaching, and role of school principals and school review officers; and \n(ii) strategies for vocational training. Topics for three more studies will be agreed during \nimplementation.  \n39.  A similar capacity-building approach will be adopted to strengthen the national capacity \nfor evaluation of the impact of specific interventions, pilots, and experiments including the pilot \nexperiment under the Project. Priorities identified are (i) impact of ESP I support to secondary \nschools on the effectiveness of instruction in project-supported schools, including agricultural \nscience and design technology programs, to be completed by the midterm review; and (ii) \npilots and policy experiments financed by the Project, including the community learning center \nin Fagaloa, and the provision of teacher housing, upon completion of these pilots. Three more \nevaluation studies may be identified during implementation. The Project will support seminars \nand/or workshops for the design, conduct, and review of the evaluation process by providing \n(i) consulting services, (ii) training workshops, (iii) operational costs, (iv) equipment, and (v) \nfield study costs. Studies will be commissioned on the basis of a competitive peer review \nprocess.  \n40.  Analysis of Causes of Low Achievement and Noncompletion, and Preparation of \na Plan of Action. A central education policy concern is the considerable variation in, and the \nlow average level of, student learning achievement; as well as the persistent presence of \nabout 20% of children of school age who do not complete their primary education. The causes \nneed to be clarified to provide a solid foundation for the formulation of an effective policy \nresponse and plan remedial interventions. The Project will support the cost of the study, \nworkshops, and consulting services. \n41.  Strengthening  of  MESC\u2019s  Capacity  for  Policy  Analysis  and  Planning.  As  the \neducation system develops and performance expectations increase, education policies, plans, \nand investments programs are becoming increasingly complex. The policy emphasis is shifting \nfrom  the  expansion  of  access  to  the  improvement  of  quality,  but  in  an  environment  of \nincreasingly constrained resources, which makes improvements in the efficiency in service \ndelivery imperative. At the same time, MESC aims to exercise increased leadership in policy \ndevelopment and reduce its reliance on external TA. To cope with the demands of policy \nanalysis and planning, and strengthen national capacity, the Project will support training and \n ", "10 \ncapacity-building focused TA. An important task will be to conduct a review of the efficiency of \npublic education expenditures. \n5.  Component  5:  Strengthening  Capacity  to  Implement  and  Manage \nDevelopment Projects \n42.  Given the importance of the education sector and the presence of several funding \nagencies, the Government wants to move to a sector approach for education. This requires \nnational capacity to manage development projects and external support that is increasingly \nprovided on a programmatic basis with progressive harmonization of procedures for financial \nmanagement, procurement, reporting on expenditures, input delivery, and progress in meeting \ndevelopment objectives and performance targets. This component is designed to assist MESC \nin building and institutionalizing capacity to achieve this goal. To ensure more effective and \nefficient implementation, the component will help ensure (i) coordination of implementation \nbetween  the  different  components  and  strategic  program  management,  (ii)  monitoring  of \nimplementation, expenditure, input delivery, and their integration in the government finance \nand reporting system; and most importantly, and (iii) implementation of robust mechanisms for \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  progress  of  the  Project\u2019s  development  objectives  and \nperformance targets. \n43.  Improved Strategic Program Management and Coordination of Implementation. \nResponsibility for coordination and strategic program management functions will rest with the \nMESC Core Executive. The development of the EPSP will provide the Government and MESC \nwith a long-term strategic vision for the education sector. To ensure that the Project and future \naid interventions are consistent with this framework and are able to respond to Government \nand MESC priorities, the Project will provide high-level technical advice and other capacity \nbuilding to the Core Executive and other parts of the MESC organization. The main form of \nassistance will be the availability of a strategic adviser, who will work, as required, directly with \nthe chief executive officer (CEO) and other members of the Core Executive. Other capacity-\nbuilding assistance may include specialized training programs for senior staff (with less formal \ntraining), study tours and/or access to overseas study through distance learning programs. In \nresponse to MESC\u2019s requests, the Project will provide technical advice and other capacity-\nbuilding  support  for  up  to  18  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  30 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services, complemented by the provision of equipment. \n44.  Integrated Financial Management System. On 1 July 2005, the Government adopted \na new financial management system (government finance and reporting system) that is more \nflexible and able to produce information and reports requested by funding agencies. However, \nthe involvement of cofinanciers in the Project does mean that some existing systems within \nMESC will have to be adapted for project-specific needs. This subcomponent will support \nMESC to establish and implement an integrated reporting framework under the government \nfinance and reporting system that meets both the Government and funding agency information \nrequirements. This will include activities such as developing guidelines for the Project\u2019s special \npurpose account (if utilized), designing a chart of accounts for project expenditure, and setting \nup project-specific reporting. \n45.  Effective Project Performance Monitoring,  Evaluation, and Reporting System. \nThe Project will have a monitoring, evaluation, and reporting system that meets the needs of \nthe Government and the development partners. MESC has the capacity to collect and report \nperformance information for the Government  within the context  of the  budget cycle. The \nProject will build on these existing systems and procedures, and support MESC to strengthen \ncapacity in performance measurement and reporting for the sector. ", "11 \n46.  Assistance will consist of technical advice to establish the requirements of the users \n(Government, ADB, AusAID, and NZAID) and determine how these can be integrated into \ncurrent  reporting  systems  and  capacity  building  for  staff  involved  in  data  collection, \ncompilation, analysis, and reporting. Other assistance may include support for regular review \nof the performance framework and development of the initial review and forward program. \nC.  Special Features \n47.  Continuity of the ESP I and Other Aid-Funded Projects. The impact of education \ninterventions  takes  a  long  time  to  be  realized.  Therefore,  the  Project  takes  a  long-term \napproach to addressing education issues in Samoa by building on earlier projects by various \nfunding agencies. The project design is built on an extensive sector review, and identified gaps \nand good practices to avoid duplication with earlier initiatives, and to build on progress. Until \nnow, almost all the major bilateral funding agencies supported curriculum and teacher training, \nbut  in  a  piecemeal  manner.  Hence,  outcomes  were  uneven  in  terms  of  real  learning \nachievements. Project design involved a participatory approach and close coordination with all \nthe bilateral and multilateral agencies, as well as nongovernment organizations, civil society \nmembers, public and private school teachers, and church groups. In addition, meetings and \nworkshops were held, and survey and study findings disseminated. International and domestic \nconsultants were used to design the Project. These domestic consultants, who were teachers \nand professors, analyzed the education sector issues extensively, identified the shortcomings \nand helped design a project that is desirable by the Government. The Project will pursue \npolicy,  institutional,  and  systematic  development  required  for  sustainable  improvement  in \nlearning achievement and efficiency. ADB is also supporting the Government in preparing a \nnew 9-year educational policy framework.9  \n48.  Building Stronger  Linkages  between Quality Inputs and  Outcomes. The project \ndesign focuses on learning achievement as the key to project success. The design takes into \naccount how to evaluate the impacts of new curriculum, assessment system, and in-service \nteacher  training  on  learning  achievements.  The  TA  will  focus  on  establishing  sustainable \ncapacity  for  teacher  development.  It  will  identify  indicators  for  teacher  effectiveness  at  the \nclassroom level. The outcomes of various quality inputs will be evaluated for the project impact. \nAlthough the staff of the Curriculum, Material, and Assessment Division have experience with \nsecondary  curriculum  development  and  primary  learning  materials  development  through \nprevious  work  with  projects,  new  content  will  be  introduced  as  well  as  new  approaches \nintegrating  learning  assessments  with  the  curriculum.  The  project  design  emphasizes  the \nimportance  of  making  learning  enjoyable  by  using  student-centered  learning  and  modern \nmultimedia materials. To address equity issues and improve learning outcomes, approaches to \nbilingual education will be introduced.  \n49.  Cooperation  with  Bilateral  Funding  Agencies  and  Harmonization  with  the \nGovernment System. Extensive consultations were taken to avoid the cofinanciers taking a \npiecemeal approach to the education system. In addition, the Project focuses on harmonizing \nthe procurement processes and reporting systems with the Government system and regulations. \nThe cooperation between cofinanciers and the harmonization of the reporting and procurement \nsystems will reduce the transaction costs for the Government, and burden of multiple reporting. \nThis  Project  will  be  financed  by  ADB,  AusAID,  NZAID,  and  the  Government  applying  a \ncofinancing  approach  and  harmonization  principles.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2004.

Financing Plan  \n51.  The Government has requested a loan of $8.06 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. \n52.  The loan, which will cover approximately 26.8% of the total project cost, will finance \n$6.28 million equivalent of the foreign exchange cost (31.5% of total foreign exchange cost) \nand $1.78 million equivalent of the local currency cost (17.7% of the total local currency cost). \nInterest during development will be capitalized as indicated in Table 1. The Government will ", "13 \nprovide $4.74 million (15.8% of total cost) including taxes and duties, and AusAID and NZAID \nwill each provide grant funds of $8.60 million equivalent (28.7% each of total cost). The grants \nfrom Australia and New Zealand will be administered by ADB in accordance with procedures \noutlined  in  Board  Paper  R289-03,  ADB-Administration  Grant  Cofinancing:  Partial \nAdministration Modality and Related Service Charges, approved 29 December 2003.

Project Management \n53.  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the Project, and MESC the \nImplementing Agency. The Education Steering Committee will provide strategic direction and \noversight for the Project. The committee comprises a chair; the Government ombudsman; and \nrepresentatives from Advisory Committee for Special Needs Education, MESC, MOF, Ministry \nof  Foreign  Affairs,  National  Council  of  Churches,  National  Council  of  Early  Childhood \nEducation of Samoa Inc., NUS, Post-Primary Principals Association, and Samoa Polytechnic. \nThe CEO of MESC is an ex-officio member of the committee, while the Office of the CEO \n(OCEO)  provides  support  and  secretariat  services.  The  committee  will  meet  whenever \nnecessary, but not less than once every quarter. It will (i) approve project progress reports, \nendorse proposed operational plans, and support the development of project budgets, (ii) \nprovide  overall  policy  and  strategic  guidance  on  project  implementation  and  decide  on \ncorrective action, if needed, (iii) ensure that project implementation is in accordance with \nGovernment education sector policies and plans, and (iv) resolve issues and conflicts that may \nemerge.  \n54.  MESC  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  day-to-day  management  of  project \nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting of progress. At the operational level, \nthe Project will be managed by the MESC Core Executive, comprising the CEO and assistant \nCEOs, and supported by the OCEO and a project coordinator. All components of the Project \nwill be implemented through the existing MESC organizational structure. Consulting services \nwill be provided to strengthen capacity of the Core Executive to deliver the Project and other \nfuture development projects effectively under component 5, which will be more transient in \nnature. The responsibility for each component will rest with the appropriate assistant CEO and \n ", "14 \nbe implemented by staff of the relevant division. They will prepare the 6-monthly review and \nprogram of activities to be financed by the Government, ADB, AusAID and NZAID and liaise \non project implementation matters with ADB, AusAID and NZAID.   \n55.  The Curriculum, Material, and Assessment Division will be responsible for delivery of \ncomponent  1,  and  the  School  Operation  Division  for  component  2.  The  current  project \nmanagement team, established for the ESP I, is planned to eventually become an integral part \nof MESC\u2019s organizational structure as an assets management unit. It will have responsibility \nfor  procurement  of  goods  and  services  for  all  components,  and  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementation of component 3. The Planning, Policy, and Research Division will implement \ncomponent 4 relating to developing a research and analytical capacity as well as policy and \nplanning.  OCEO  or  MESC  Core  Executive  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of \ncomponent 5. Two subcommittees will be established under components 2 and 3: (i) in-service \ntraining  subcommittee  consisting  of  assistant  CEOs  for  School  Operation  Division  and \nCurriculum,  Material,  and  Assessment  Division,  an  OCEO  representative,  and  principal \neducation  officers  for  in-service  training  and  primary  and  secondary  curriculum;  and  (ii) \ninfrastructure subcommittee composed of an OCEO representative, the head of the project \nmanagement team, all assistant CEOs, and representatives from the Ministry of Works and \nMOF. The proposed organizational structure is attached in Appendix 8. \n2.  Implementation Period  \n56.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years.  Loan  effectiveness  is  planned  for \nFebruary 2006, and project completion for December 2012. An implementation schedule is \nattached in Appendix 9. \n3.  Procurement \n57.  All goods and services financed under the Project will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Government guidelines for procurement acceptable to \nADB.10 The contract for the MESC headquarters estimated to cost more than $1,000,000 will \nbe awarded following ADB\u2019s international competitive bidding procedures. All other contracts \nunder the Project  will be  awarded following  local competitive  bidding in  accordance  with \nGovernment procedures. Each contract awarded on the basis local competitive bidding will be \nsubject to ADB\u2019s retroactive approval, provided that if the award or terms of any such contract \nare not approved by ADB, MOF will not use the loan proceeds to finance the contract and will \nprovide financing from its own or other resources. The project management team will be \nresponsible for all procurement. The indicative procurement packages are listed in Appendix \n10.  \n58.  Advance Procurement Action. For early commencement of project implementation \nand as requested by the Government, ADB approved advance procurement action for civil \nworks,  covering  invitation  of  bids,  bidding,  and  bid  evaluation,  but  not  including  contract \nawards. The Government has been advised that approval of the advance action does not \ncommit ADB to financing the Project.  \n                                                 \n10 Government of Samoa, Tender Board. 2003. Guidelines for Government Procurement by Public Tender. Apia, \nSamoa: Treasury Department (February). ", "15 \n4.  Consulting Services \n59.  The Project will provide about 103 person-months of international consulting services \nand  122  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  All  international  and  associated \ndomestic consultants will be selected and recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. All international consulting services will be provided by either firms or individuals, \nin each case determined by MOF. The domestic consulting services will cover all services \nexcept  for  the  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  use  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method for recruitment of firms. The Project includes a flexible provision for a pool of \ninternational and domestic consultancies for MOF to meet additional needs arising during \nproject implementation, including small consulting service contracts for supervision of civil \nworks. The indicative summary of consulting inputs is in Appendix 11. The Project will provide \nconsultant  services  for  primary  curriculum  development,  assessment  system,  information \ncommunication technology, audiovisual specialist, bilingual, primary subject area specialist, \nadvocacy,  pre-service  and,  in-service  teacher  development,  public  opinion  assessment, \neducation equipment procurement, civil works, education research methods, education sector \nexpenditure  review,  education  sector  planning,  and  project  management  monitoring,  and \nevaluation. Supplementary Appendix B includes the outline terms of reference. \n  5.  Anticorruption Measures \n60.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nMOF. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations and \nthe  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of MOF and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n  6.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n61.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. To facilitate disbursements and project implementation, an \nimprest account will be established by the Government in a bank acceptable to ADB. The \ninitial amount to be deposited to the imprest account by ADB should not exceed $300,000 or \nthe  estimated  6  months  eligible  project  expenditures,  whichever  is  lower.  Statement  of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedures will be used to liquidate the imprest account.  \n62.  SOE procedures will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures under activities funded \nby ADB, and to liquidate advances provided to the imprest account in accordance with the \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. Each individual payment reimbursed or liquidated by ADB \nunder the SOE procedures will not exceed $50,000 equivalent. On a quarterly basis or earlier, \nMOF will prepare and provide the SOE report for liquidation of the imprest accounts and \nwithdrawal application to ADB for replenishment. \n63.  AusAID and NZAID grant funds will be deposited directly into a special account to be \nestablished by the Government. Under the partial administration arrangement, ADB, AusAID, \nand NZAID will review the quarterly SOE reports and disburse funds based on 6-month \nforward plan from the Government. Information on all disbursement decisions made to the \n ", "16 \nproject by all donors will be shared with all other project donors. Eligibility of expenditures to \nbe financed under the project shall be in accordance with ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n64.  MESC will maintain separate records and accounts for all expenditures to be financed \nby  the  Project  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  They  will  specify  the \nexpenditures for all activities and identify all expenditures to be financed by the Project. Project \naccounts, including financial statements, SOEs, and imprest account records, will be audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to all development partners. The auditors\u2019 report, and copies \nof the certified accounts and related financial statements, including compliance with project \ncovenants and the use of the imprest accounts, will be submitted to all partners in English not \nlater than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. Additional financial \naudits and financial management and systems reviews may be undertaken by ADB, AusAID, \nand NSAID in accordance with agreed-upon rules and regulations. \n65.  MESC will prepare a single report each quarter on all implementation activities in a \nformat acceptable to all the project cofinanciers. MESC will provide these reports to the \ncofinanciers as well as each member of the Education Steering Committee, within 30 days \nafter the end of the applicable period. Within 3 months after physical completion of the Project, \nMESC will submit a project completion report to ADB, AusAID, and NSAID. \n  8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n66.  Operational Plans. In line with the Government budget cycle, every 6 months MESC \nwill prepare a forward program/operating plan for the following 6 months. This is expected to \ntake place in March (for the following fiscal year starting in July) and in October (at the time of \nthe Government budget review). The operational plan will outline what is to be funded under \nthe Project. It will include (i) data on the proposed allocations to primary and secondary \neducation  by  salary  and  nonsalary  items;  (ii)  status  of  agreed-upon  policy  reforms  and \ncovenants;  (iii)  fully  costed  project  activities  proposed  for  each  subcomponent,  with \nperformance targets; and (iv) a list of secondary schools targeted for upgrading during the \nyear. The plan will also provide estimates of the operation and maintenance budget and \nidentify the amount of counterpart funds to be provided. The review and forward program will \nbe the primary mechanism for the Government to request funding from AusAID and NZAID.  \n67.  Monitoring and Evaluation. MESC has a monitoring and evaluation system that will \nbe strengthened to provide improved and reliable indicators for assessing project progress \n(Appendix 12). As part of the 6-monthly review and forward program cycle (para. 63), MESC \nwill provide a report on performance targets for the previous 6 months along with the forward \nprogram  plan.  The  process  will  include  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  implementation \nperformance,  provide  management  information,  and  assess  the  impact  of  the  Project  on \nlearning outcomes. Project performance monitoring will focus upon project implementation \nplans  and  targets  and  their  execution,  achievements,  and  progress  toward  project \nperformance indicators. For example, indicators such as school enrollments; deployment of \nscience teachers to underprivileged regions; examination results, including ongoing school-\nbased assessment system; and the effectiveness of trained teachers in implementing new \ncurriculum and assessment system will be used. MESC will monitor project activities using \ndata and feedback from schools, and data received from consultants. \n68.  MESC will monitor and evaluate the project outcomes, in accordance with the schedule \nand  terms  of  reference  agreed  upon,  by  the  Government,  ADB,  AusAID,  and  NZAID. ", "17 \nPerformance  evaluations  will  examine  the  impact  of  project  interventions  on  learning \noutcomes, as can be measured by standardized assessment.  \n  9.   Project Review \n69.  During the first year of the Project, the Government, ADB, AusAID, and NZAID will \nconduct a semiannual review of project performance. In subsequent years of the Project, the \nGovernment, ADB, AusAID, and NZAID will conduct at least one joint project review per \nyear. This  joint  project  review will  include  an  examination  of  the  budgetary  allocations, \noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  staffing  and  other  incremental  recurrent  costs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  achievements  under  the  Project.  The  review  includes \nassessing progress in each component, identifying difficulties and constraints, and determining \nways to overcome them. MESC management, specifically the CEO and assistant CEOs, will \nbe a primary source of information for these reviews.  \n70.  In addition, the Government, ADB, AusAID, and NZAID will jointly conduct a midterm \nreview during the third year of implementation. This will (i) review the scope, design, and \nproject implementation arrangements; (ii) evaluate pilot programs; (iii) assess performance \nagainst targets and benchmarks; (iv) review lessons and experiences with implementation of \neach  component;  (v)  review  compliance  with  the  loan  agreement  and  bilateral  funding \nagreement(s); and (vi) recommend any changes in project implementation, if required. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits  \n71.  The Project will support developing new primary curriculum in Samoan, English, social \nsciences, mathematics, and science, with supporting learning materials and extensive in-\nservice teacher training. The assessment system will be reformed and strengthened and the \ncapacity  to  design  and  produce  high-quality  learning  materials  established.  These \ninterventions are expected to improve rural students\u2019 learning, thus ensuring they acquire \nlanguage skills, have more opportunities for further education and training, and are able to \nperform better in the formal labor market. More than 40,000 primary school students will \nbenefit from investments. Children in disadvantaged areas will be the principal beneficiaries.  \n72.  The Project will support more equitable provision of qualified teachers. For primary \nschools, the Project will support a pilot to retain qualified teachers in schools in remote rural \nlocations. The upgrading of secondary school facilities in disadvantaged districts to national \nstandards will include provision of equipment and furniture, and operation and maintenance \nfunds. The primary beneficiaries will be 15,000 rural children enrolled in secondary schools of \na national standard. This is expected to also improve primary school completion rates.  \n73.  Impact on Poverty and Gender. Improved access to better education and training will \nincrease the participation of the disadvantaged in the formal labor market. By targeting rural \nlocations, gains will also flow into the local economy. Male participation in higher education \nand retention in rural areas will be improved. Special education needs will be fully taken into \naccount in the new curricula and upgraded school facilities. \n74.  Environment  and  Social  Safeguards.  The  Project  will  involve  upgrading  and \nrehabilitating  existing  school  facilities  and  MESC  headquarters,  with  no  negative \nenvironmental or resettlement impact. No land acquisition or resettlement is required under the \nProject. All the land for the schools is already at the existing school sites and adequate for the \n ", "18 \nadditional classrooms for new subject curricula. The summary poverty reduction and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 13. \n75.  Economic Benefits and Financial Sustainability. International evidence finds a high \nsocial  and  economic  return  to  primary  and  secondary  education  investment.  In  Samoa, \nparticipation in secondary education is a prerequisite for entry into the formal labor market. In \n2000, a study on the private sector workforce found that 93% of the private sector workforce \nhad secondary education. Overseas remittances by Samoans working abroad constitute about \n17.4%  of  national  income  and  educational  qualifications  are  required  for  successful \nemigration. Better education will help disadvantaged groups benefit economically from the \nProject. The anticipated social benefits are the foundation for Samoa\u2019s commitment to the \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n76.  Despite  considerable  Government  efforts,  the  education  sector  is  dependent  on \nexternal assistance grants to finance development as well as nonsalary recurrent costs. In \nrecent years between 20% and 45% of total sector funding has been in the form of grants and \nloans.  During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  a  financial  analysis  and  projection  model  was \ndeveloped, which suggests that with growth in the economy the Government will likely be able \nto sustain the recurrent costs of the system within the next decade. Funds for proposed \noperational and debt repayments are clearly identified in the project financing framework and \nwill be reflected in future Government budgets. Appendix 14 provides additional details on the \neconomic analysis, and financial and sustainability analyses.  \n77.  The Project will provide bridging support to allow continuity in the provision of critical \nquality inputs. Policy analysis and dialogue during the preparation of the next 9-year plan will \ninclude  education  sector  financing  and  sustainability  issues.  The  Project  will  provide \noperational financing, and research and training programs aimed at strengthening policy and \nstrategy  development  to  support  improved  aid  coordination  and  transition  to  a  sector \napproach.  \n78.  Financial Management Assessment. A review of the financial management systems \nof MOF and MESC was completed.11 This review and a World Bank financial management \nassessment conducted by a qualified accredited financial management specialist under the \nCyclone Emergency Recovery Project in April 2004,12 indicate that the financial management \nsystems and procedures proposed for the Project meet ADB\u2019s requirements. A summary is \npresented in Appendix 15 with supporting details provided in Supplementary Appendix C. \nB.  Risks  \n79.  Increasing Pressure on the Recurrent Budget. In Samoa, new investments must be \ncarefully assessed for their impact on the provision of nonsalary recurrent inputs. The Project \nprovides support for materials development, teacher training, and other quality enhancements \nand adopts a bridging strategy that provides continuity. The development of a sector policy \nand financing framework with sustainable operation and maintenance costs\u2014supported by \nADB and other development partners under the EPSP\u2014will address this risk.  \n80.  Investments in Civil Works May Not be Maintained. Many communities cannot meet \nthe costs of utilities and routine maintenance of buildings and equipment does not occur. This \n                                                 \n11 Financial assessment of MOF and MESC was undertaken during the Fact-Finding Mission for the Project from 30 \nMay to 14 June.  \n12 Independent  State  of  Samoa;  Cyclone  Emergency  Recovery  Project;  Financial  Management  Assessment \nSummary; Report No. T-7622. ", "19 \nrisk will be partly offset by the sector policy framework being developed, which will provide \npolicies and procedures for maintenance and asset protection.  \n81.  Investments  in  Teacher  Training  May  Be  Lost  through  Attrition.  Retention  of \nteachers with expertise is difficult, as they are in demand by the private sector and/or other \nGovernment  ministries.  Teacher  training,  particularly  in  information  and  communication \ntechnology, may contribute to attrition from the profession and investments could be lost. \nUnder the Project (and through building capacity for teacher development, policy development, \nand strategic planning), the Government will assess teacher development issues and develop \nstrategies to address them. Improvements in physical work environments and the introduction \nof innovative teaching techniques are expected to improve teacher job satisfaction. \n82.  Facilities  May  Be  Underutilized  Due  to  Patterns  of  Internal  Migration.  Some \nsecondary schools have very low enrollments and are in close proximity. In such instances, \nefficiency could be improved by rationalizing school provision. A detailed forecast of future \ndemand for secondary schools to be upgraded under the Project has been undertaken. ADB, \nAusAID, and NZAID will continue policy dialogue on rationalization of the education system \nand will assist MESC in developing student flow and simulation models for more efficient \ninvestments in civil works. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n83.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n84.  The government will commission an external review of the efficiency of procurement \nmethods and contracts packaging for equipment and materials procured under ESP I and \ndiscuss the findings during the Project inception and agree with the ADB, AusAID, and NZAID \non the remedial measures to be taken based on such review prior to engaging in procurement \nunder this Project. \n85.  Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will (i) develop an evidence \nbased Education, Sports and Culture Policy and Strategic Plan (2006-2014) for the education \nsector,  including  impact  studies  on  poverty  alleviation  and  targeted  support  to  the \neconomically  disadvantaged;  (ii)  provide  a  copy  of  such  strategic  plan  to  ADB,  AusAID, \nNZAID,  and other relevant development partners for review and comments prior to tabling \nsuch plan for cabinet approval; (iii) consider comments from ADB, AusAID, and NZAID prior to \ntabling such policy and plan for approval; and (iv) table it for cabinet approval.  \n86.  Within 3 year of loan effectiveness, the Government will (i) develop a policy and \nstrategy on teacher supply and demand and conditions of service based on, inter alia, (a) the \nfindings and recommendations of the supply and demand study supported under ESP I;13 (b) \nanalyses  and  recommendations  that  will  emerge  from  the  TA  for  National  Teacher \nDevelopment Framework, (c) findings of pilot projects on teacher housing financed under the \nProject,  (ii)  provide  the  policy  and  strategy  to  ADB  and  bilateral  donors  for  review  and \ncomments, (iii) consider comments from ADB and the bilateral donors prior to tabling such \npolicy and strategy for approval, and (iv) table it for cabinet approval (v) and implement it in \naccordance with its terms.  \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2000.

Within 3 years of loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure that a system to \nassess student learning outcomes and the impact of the project investments is in place. This \nwill include developing a sample based standardized system for the assessment of student \nlearning that will be used as a baseline for reporting of progress towards key performance \nindicators.  \n88.   The Government will cause submission of a satisfactory maintenance plan by the \nrespective communities as a condition precedent to their schools being upgraded under the \nProject. \n89.  The Government will take, and shall cause MOF and MESC to take, all necessary \nmeasures, including the provision of additional funds, to ensure that sufficient counterpart \nfunds are made available and provided for the Project in a timely manner.  \n90.  Within the Project period, the Government will develop and implement a plan for the \nrationalization of schools to ensure resources are used cost-effectively.  \n91.  MESC will cause the contractors to maximize the employment of local persons in \nparticular those who suffer hardship, who meet the job and efficiency requirements for the \nconstruction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of Project facilities. Contractors shall be required \nto give due consideration to the contribution of local women for the construction, rehabilitation, \nand maintenance of Project facilities.  \n92.  The Government will ensure that the Project will not entail any involuntary resettlement.  \n93.  Within  3  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  (i)  developed \ncomprehensive  action  plans  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  mainstream  information  and \ncommunication  technology  education  in  secondary  schools,  and  (ii)  taken  appropriate \nmeasures based on the lessons learned from the ADB-supported SchoolNet pilot project \n(footnote 6) to expand outreach to rural areas.  \n94.  Within 3 years of loan effectiveness, the Government will develop and implement a \nplan for every child to have a complete set of textbooks that will address issues of finance, \nprocurement, storage, distribution, and school based policies to extend the life of textbooks. \nThe Government will allocate adequate funding in the education budget for financing the \ndevelopment and implementation of this plan. \n95.  The Government shall jointly undertake with ADB, AusAID, and NZAID two reviews of \nthe Project in the first year of Project Implementation, a review of the Project each subsequent \nyear and a midterm review of the Project at the end of the third year of Project Implementation. \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n96.  The Government shall have entered into a binding agreement with AusAID and NZAID \nfor the cofinancing of the Project. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n97.

Overview  \n1.  The education system in Samoa consists of 8 years of compulsory primary (ages 5\u201314 \nyears), 5 years of secondary (15\u201319), and 4 years of higher education. National examinations \nare held in years 8 and 12. For year 13, a regional examination provides access to the university \npreliminary  year.  The  National  University  of  Samoa,  Samoa  Polytechnic,  and  some  other \npostsecondary institutions in Apia offer postsecondary education. The Ministry of Education, \nSports, and Culture (MESC) is responsible for policy formulation, guidance, and supervision of \nall government schools and institutions. Village committees run and secondary schools and are \nresponsible  for  setting,  collecting,  and  spending  school  fees;  constructing  and  maintaining \nbuildings;  and  providing  consumables.  The  Government  funds  teachers\u2019  salaries,  some \nconsumables, and initial sets of textbooks every 5 years for primary schools. The exceptions are \nfour government senior colleges, one on Savai\u2019i and three on Upolu, which are fully government \nfunded. \n2.  The Government has made considerable progress since adopting education policies and \nstrategies for 1995\u20132005. Among them are development and provision of textbooks and learning \nresources for primary education, a new secondary curriculum, upgrading of facilities in primary \nand  secondary  schools,  establishment  of  an  education  resource  center  on  Savai\u2019i,  and \nexpansion  of  special  needs  education  and  early  childhood  education.  MESC  management \ncapacity has been strengthened. A comprehensive management information system has been \ndeveloped. Long-term policies and strategies have been elaborated in a framework designed for \nfuture policy, strategy, and corporate planning. \nB.  Access and Equity \n3.  Generally children throughout Samoa have access to primary and secondary education. \nGender equity is not a serious issue. However not all children participate. In 2004, 40,137 \nstudents were enrolled in primary education (69% of the age group) up from 39,639 in 2003. \nAvailable data indicate that net enrollment in primary education declined from 77% in 1995 to \n69% in 2004. Since 1995, the participation rate (gross enrollment rate in primary education has \nremained around 97%. Between 1995 and 2004, secondary enrollment increased by 11% from \n13,298 to 14,766. The net enrollment rate has progressively improved from 36% to 43%. While \nthe female primary enrollment rate was lower (48%), female secondary enrollment was higher \n(52%). Of the 160 primary schools, about 9% are church schools and 3% are private schools. Of \nthe 46 secondary schools, 41% are church schools and 4% are private schools; the remainder \nare public schools.  \n4.  About 84% of year 1 entrants were retained at year 8 (retention rate), and 88% of year 8 \ngraduates went on to year 9 (transition rate), up from 82% in 1994/95. In 2004, 77% of year 9 \nentrants completed year 12 and 57% of the year 12 graduates continued on to year 13, an \nincrease of 10% from 1995. However, more than half of the year 13 students do not complete \nschooling. \n5.  Every village has a primary school. Clusters of villages make up districts and each district \nhas a secondary school with the bigger ones having two. Theoretically access to schools should \nnot be an issue. Recent community consultations identified the condition of school facilities as an \nimportant  source  of  dissatisfaction.  Although  many  primary  schools  and  some  secondary \nschools have been upgraded in recent years, schools in the poorer areas still operate in facilities \nthat  do  not  meet  national  standards,  often  without  proper  classrooms  and  equipment. \nSubstandard schools convey an image of poor quality service, create an apathetic teaching and \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nlearning environment, and can result in low student learning and high dropout. Access and \nequity in education are also related to languages of instruction, particularly English in the later \nyears of schooling. Although predominantly in Samoan in the first 3 years of primary grades, \nEnglish competency becomes a major factor toward late primary and all of secondary school. \nNational policy requires pluralistic bilingualism; the acquisition of English while maintaining and \ndeveloping Samoan. Rural children have less access to social conditions that enable greater \ncompetency and fluency in English. Although English seems to play a major part in formal \nschooling, Samoan must be equally addressed because Samoan competency becomes crucial \nin adulthood when people take on various roles in their families, in the workplace, and in society \nat large. Bilingualism is therefore a key factor in access and equity. Access is also limited due to \nother  factors  such  as  inability  to  pay  (hardship),  migration,  and  social  priorities  other  than \neducation upon which expenditures are made. \nC.  Quality \n6.  Graduates have low levels of functional literacy and numeracy. This results from an \neducation system that fails to prepare students for higher learning. Achievement tests conducted \nat primary level (Samoa primary education literacy level [SPELL] one, SPELL two, and the year \n8 examination) and at secondary level (year 12 examination) indicate that achievement is below \nexpectations and, in a number of subject areas, declining. The SPELL one test results show that \na record 57% of children are at risk in year 4. Since 1995, improvements have been made in \nSamoan literacy, but 30% of children are still at risk of not achieving the required literacy level; in \nnumeracy, 33% are at risk. The SPELL two test results (for year 6 students) are even more of a \nconcern. Results in English deteriorated from 14% at risk in 2001 to 57% at risk in 2003. For \nSamoan, they declined slightly from 14% to 16%; while the numeracy results increased from \n55% in 2001 to 73% in 2003. However, an analysis of district figures shows disparities that point \nto faults in the tests, If MESC continues to use these tests they must be re-examined and \nvalidated. The assessment system needs careful reexamination. \n7.  The mean (raw) scores on the year 8 examinations in all subjects from 1997 to 2002 \nshow a steady decline in all mean scores. On a scale of 100, English declined from 42 to 37, \nSamoan 59 to 47, mathematics 30 to 28.7, basic science 39 to 24.8, and social science 42 to \n25.8. SPELL one and two and the year 8 examinations indicate declines in quality. More year 4 \nand 6 students are at risk and year 8 examination results continue to decline. By these more \ndirect and objective measures of education quality, the situation in primary grades is a serious \nconcern.  \n8.  Students completing secondary school and passing examinations to enter postsecondary \nand university courses are deficient in basic numeracy and literacy skills. Many secondary \nschools  do  not  offer  one  or  more  applied  subjects  due  to  lack  of  teachers,  materials,  or \nequipment. At secondary level, scores on the year 12 examination generally declined over the 5 \nyears between 1997 and 2002, but increased in 2003. If this trend is maintained, it could reflect \nthe efforts of recent projects aimed at improving the quality of secondary education.  \n9.  The primary school curriculum is problematic; it is about 25 years old. Also absent are \nclear guidelines of expected learning outcomes set for literacy and numeracy skills, as well as \nsocial and cultural skills that children should master as they progress through primary school. An \nupdated curriculum policy framework and subject and year-level curriculum statements that \nemphasize more active, child-centered learning activities in the classroom, strengthening of \npedagogical teaching skills, and a range of classroom assessment techniques, is essential for \nhigh-quality teaching and learning. The Government intends to develop an integrated curriculum \nfor primary years 1\u20133 and subject-specific curricula in seven subject areas for years 4\u20138, which \ntake into account bilingual needs. Ensuring citizens are fluent in both Samoan and English is an ", "Appendix 2  29 \nobjective of the Government, and an effective bilingual policy and program is a priority. A \nsecondary education curriculum framework for years 9\u201313 is being implemented. The primary \ncurriculum needs to be reviewed; teachers provided with manuals, textbooks, and learning \nmaterials; and related in-service training programs designed. More effective instructional practice \nwill also have to include an effective use of assessment. Modern assessment strategies have \nbeen introduced in recent curriculum projects supported by development partners. These are, \nhowever, not yet widely applied.  \n10.  The supply of learning materials to schools to date has largely been dependent on \nprojects undertaken by external assistance agencies with the Government. Present quantities \nare insufficient. Books are typically shared, remain in school, and generally are not available for \nhomework and personal study purposes. Shortages have been reported to force students to \ncopy material from the blackboard. Many primary teachers have been trained in more learner-\ncentered teaching and assessment methods, but learning materials are still based on the older \ncurriculum. The new curriculum framework (years 1\u201313), including the introduction of bilingual \neducation  in  primary  schools,  will  create  a  significant  need  for  new  textbooks,  student \nworkbooks, and other learning materials. Moreover supplementary materials such as readers (in \nSamoan and English) and audiovisual materials are in short supply. Shortages of teaching and \nlearning resources unfavorably affect teaching effectiveness and impair the ability of teachers to \nuse new improved teaching practices that the new curricula call for. \n11.  Teachers play the leading role in delivering quality education. Well-trained teachers with \nadequate skills to transmit knowledge and manage classrooms are in short supply. Primary \nteacher attrition rates are as high as 5% annually. Unless corrective action is taken to reduce \nattrition, the output of the preservice program will need to double. At the secondary level, the \ngrowth  in  enrollments  will  require  an  increase  in  the  output  of  the  preservice  programs. \nSignificant shortages can be expected in sciences, economics, and accounting. In addition, \nteachers need to be trained in the new curriculum that will be introduced. \n12.  The importance of having well-trained teachers is realized and the Government has \nimplemented  a  number  of  projects  aimed  at  improving  teaching.  The  Primary  Education \nMaterials  Project  Phase  I  (1998-2000)  and  Phase  II  (2000-2004)  have  provided  in-service \ntraining for 2,753 primary school teachers. The Samoa Secondary Education Curriculum and \nResources  Project  and  Education  Sector  Project  I  provided  in-service  training  for  2,489 \nsecondary teachers. However, some teachers express a lack of understanding of how to put \nnew curriculum and teaching methods into practice in the classroom. \nD.  Efficiency  \n13.  The trend in repetition rates (the percentage of children remaining in the same grade) in \nprimary education has been variable over the years. Rates for some grades have increased; \nothers have decreased. The average repetition rate in primary schools has fluctuated between \n1.1% and 2.1%. In 1995, the rate was 2.0%, in 2003 it was 2.1%, and in 2004 1.7%. Repetition \nrates in secondary schools also have generally improved since 1995, but remain high at the \nupper grades. Repetition rates are highest for years 12 and 13 where screening examinations \nare imminent. \n14.  In 2003, the repetition rate was high in years 1 (6%) and 8 (4%), 11 (5%), 12 (10%), and \n13 (9%). The dropout rate in years 1\u20132 was 5%, and increased to 9% in years 8\u20139. The \nsecondary school dropout rate was high in years 10\u201311 (12%) and 12\u201313 (38%), indicating that \nmore than half of secondary school students drop out before completing the cycle. The trends \nare positive, but the high dropout from year 1 is a concern given the objective of primary \neducation for all. Dropout in years 8\u20139 through 12\u201313 has improved but remains high. The high \ndropout in years 12\u201313 can be attributed to students discontinuing their education after the \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nPacific senior secondary certificate. One main cause of dropping out is the low level of learning \noutcomes, as demonstrated in the year-end examinations. Another cause seems to be related to \nhigh tuition fees. The factors affecting education quality are many and are interlinked, hence \ndifficult to untangle. It is clear that curriculum, materials, assessment systems, pre- and in-\nservice teacher training, and Samoan language of instruction are among the important factors.  \n15.  Two  other  indicators  are  often  used  for  efficiency:  completion  and  transition  rates. \nCompletion rate is difficult to calculate for lack of data. A rough recalculation indicates about \n75.6% children entering year 1 will complete year 8 after 8 years and 35.5% of youth entering \nyear 9 will complete year 13 after 5 years. The transition rate from primary to lower secondary \nhas increased since 1996. However, the rate from lower to upper secondary education has \ndeclined. The transition rate from year 12 to year 13 has increased since 1996, but in 2003 \nremained the same as it was in 1999. In 2004, the rate increased markedly from 52% to 57% \ndue perhaps to efforts to extend year 13 to all secondary schools.  \nE.  Relevance  \n16.  The education system serves two labor markets: internal and external. The internal labor \nmarket centers upon agriculture, fishery, construction and transportation, and small business. \nManufacturing and services sectors have been increasing recently. Yet, few formal wage paying \npositions are available in the country for highly trained technicians or skilled workers. As a result, \na large number of Samoans (35.4% of the resident population of Samoa) live overseas and \nmany hold such jobs. The funds they repatriate represent about 17.4% of national income. Many \nSamoan youth also study in universities overseas prior to returning to the country. The education \nsystem, therefore, must serve two client groups with different aspirations and choices. An effort \nis being made to do so by replacing the two-track secondary education system with a system \nproviding a compulsory general education with elective applied subjects. Providing the basic \ngeneral knowledge and skills needed to move to higher levels of education, while at the same \ntime providing relevant job skills, is challenging.  \n17.  Providing secondary students with a good general education helps make them trainable. \nIt  also  prepares  them  for  higher  education.  Providing  skills  training  in  addition  to  general \neducation can be valuable as well, but the course content must remain relevant. It is suggested \nthat, the Government should assign qualified teachers; increase budget; and improve teaching of \napplied subjects such as agriculture science, design technology, carpentry, and textile at the \nsecondary level to make the system effective. \n18.  An average of about 4,350 youth leave school each year. The majority enter the labor \nforce,  but  few  find  formal  employment.  Primary  production  allows  a  livelihood  for  many \nSamoans, yet increased Government investment is needed in technical education aimed at \nimproving sector productivity. Low investment in agricultural skill reinforces the low image that \nwork in the primary sector has among people. Therefore, government investment in this area \nwould be both pro-poor and growth oriented.  \nF.  Finance  \n19.  Education, consistently the largest single item in the national budget, averaged between \n15.5% and 19% per annum during the past 5 years. External assistance through grants for \nspecific  programs  is  provided  by  many  donors.  ADB  is  the  only  lending  agency.  Parent \ncontributions  to  primary  and  secondary  education  through  fees  are  minimal.  Fees  are \ndetermined by individual school committees. Generally the income is sufficient only to pay for \nbasic utilities.  \n20.  An important issue concerns the high level of salary expenditure in the recurrent budget. \nAt  about  95%,  it  is  well  above  that  of  most  countries  (with  the  exception  of  other  Pacific ", "Appendix 2  31 \ncountries). Very few resources are left for other operational expenditures. This is a concern in \nview of the need to raise the morale of teachers and the need for new teachers. The inability of \nmany  communities  to  provide  funds  for  school  maintenance  is  another  concern.  As  the \neducation sector is already a primary recipient of government budgetary support, opportunities \nfor increasing overall government expenditure on education may be limited. The only likely \nopportunities for generating additional resources may be improvements in efficiency.  \nG.  Management  \n21.  MESC is responsible for education policy, planning, and administration of government \nprimary  and  secondary  schools.  It  liaises  with  churches  and  private  schools  to  which  the \nGovernment provides an annual per capita grant (ST2,550,000 in 2004/05). Early childhood \neducation and special education remain outside MESC administration, but the status is being \nreviewed and may be administered by MESC in the near future. Operational administration of \nMESC is the responsibility of the chief executive officer (CEO) who oversees the work of seven \ndivisions: (i) school operations; (ii) curriculum materials and assessment; (iii) policy, planning, \nand research; (iv) corporate services; (v) sports; (vi) culture; and (vii) Savai\u2019i divisions. An \nassistant CEO heads each division. Management oversight within MESC is the responsibility of \nthe Core Executive, which meets weekly and consists of the CEO (chair), assistant CEOs, head \nof the Institutional Strengthening Project, and manager of the Education Sector Project I project \nmanagement team. Policies are implemented by way of corporate planning, introduced on a tri-\nannual basis from 2000. The effectiveness of implementation is reviewed annually and prior to \nthe preparation of the next medium-term corporate plan. \n22.  MESC  has  prepared  a  school  management  and  organization  manual.  The  manual \noutlines  the  responsibilities  of  the  community,  school  committee,  school  principal,  parents, \nstudents,  and  school  review  officer.  Facilities  and  equipment  maintenance  procedures  are \ndescribed. It outlines the school annual plan. Schools will prepare annual plans in collaboration \nwith school committees. These include school improvement plans, budgets, curriculum, and \nmaintenance plans. A minimum standard baseline checklist has been developed and can be \nused to identify schools where management, leadership, or other training may still be required. \n23.  Despite major undertakings, weaknesses remain, hampering efforts to improve efficiency \nand  effectiveness  of  service  delivery.  The  education  management  information  system  is \noperating effectively, and provides detailed education statistics, but they are not always used \nand  uncertainties  remain  on  key  indicators  such  as  gross  and  net  enrollment  rates.  The \nassessment system needs to be revised to be useful for managing and monitoring quality. The \nresearch capacity needs to be strengthened if it is to help address key questions of education \npolicy. Innovations need to be piloted, evaluated, and when successful, expanded nationwide \nPolicies and procedures for school and community development planning have been developed \nand piloted. They need to be implemented and supported by training and financial resources. \nSchool management committees have been established but their roles and responsibilities need \nto be clarified and their capacities developed. The potential of information and communication \ntechnology  in  strengthening  the  capacity  of  education  sector  management  needs  to  be \ndeveloped. \n24.  An important management challenge is to increase the effectiveness of external aid to \nthe  sector.  The  short\u2013term  focus  of  projects,  overlap  and  duplication  of  objectives  and \ninvestments, fragmentation of effort, and multiple planning and reporting requirements weaken \nthe overall impact of aid. Aid coordination has improved in recent years, but the Government \nneeds to take a leadership role and agencies need to agree formally on arrangements to align \nagency objectives and Government priorities and harmonize procedures and processes for a \nsector approach including joint reviews and cofinancing. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SAMOAN EDUCATION SECTOR \nFunding

Critical issues noted in the country\u2019s development strategies for 2002\u20132004 and 2005-\n20071  are  (i)  uncoordinated  approach  to  teacher  development  and  supply  of  well-trained \nteachers, (ii) lack of national standards for teacher competencies, (iii) inadequate subject and \npedagogical  knowledge  and  skills  to  encourage  higher  order  learning,  and  (iv)  insufficient \nknowledge of contemporary classroom management practices. These issues contribute to (i) \nlow levels of student achievements and of functional literacy and numeracy, even among the \nhigh-school graduates; (ii) inequitable access to quality schooling among the disadvantaged; (iii) \nhigh repetition and dropout rates; (iv) higher turnover of teachers; and (v) irrelevant curriculum.  \n2.  Teacher quality is one reason for the low quality of education. While the curriculum is \nbeing modernized and new teaching resources are being developed, a similar investment is not \nbeing made in teacher development. As a result, both pre- and in-service teacher training has \nnot kept pace with the rapidly changing knowledge, skills, and dispositions required by the new \ncurriculum, teaching approaches, and teaching resources. Given the urgency of the concern \nabout teacher quality, recent teacher training interventions have targeted in-service training \nsupported by external funding, which are not sustained. Such project-based training provides \ntemporary  relief  but  also  creates  a  gap  between  pre-  and  in-service  teacher  training  and \ndifferent levels of teacher proficiency. The technical assistance (TA) will help  the design and \ndevelopment of the teacher training activities planned in the Education Sector Project II. \n3.  To increase the efficiency of the education system, long-term prioritized and sequenced \nsector  reform,  and  teacher  development  need  to  be  addressed  the  Strategy  for  the \nDevelopment of Samoa, 2002-2004. Such an approach with an investment plan will allow better \ncoordination  of  education  assistance,  and  responsiveness  of  education  services  to  supply \nappropriately trained teachers for the different grades and subject specialization.  \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Output \n4.  The TA is to help the Government develop a comprehensive system for development \nand management of high-quality teachers. The outputs will be (i) an institutional structure with \nnecessary legislation to manage and monitor the quality of teacher development; (ii) a set of \npolicies and procedures to manage all activities associated with teacher development, quality, \nand supply; (iii) an agreed financial planning, management, and monitoring system for the \nreform of teacher development with detailed budgeting and funding options; and (iv) an agreed \npartnership between all stakeholders involved in teacher development. The TA output will be \npresented in a single comprehensive report compiled from the individual reports. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Table A5.1. \nB.  Cost and Financing  \n5.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $450,000 equivalent, of which $281,000 is the \nforeign  exchange cost and  $169,000  equivalent the local currency cost (Table  A5.2). The \nGovernment  has  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  finance  $350,000  (78%) \nequivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $69,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \n                                                 \n1  Government of Samoa. 2002.

The TA  will be  undertaken  over  10  months in two  phases.  During the first phase, \nstakeholder  consultation  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  ownership  of  the  recommendations \nincluded in the reports and the eventual national teacher development framework (NTDF). This \nwill  involve  five  formal  workshops  to  consider  alternative  approaches  to  developing  and \nmanaging an NTDF. During phase one, existing education documents; census data on teacher \nrecruitments and student enrollments; teacher supply; demand, and quality; available financial \nresources; and absorptive capacity of teacher development activities will be reviewed. The \nreview will cover capacity and quality of all teacher training institutions in the country and the \nprograms offered by them. A short sample survey will be conducted to collect disaggregated \ndata for net teacher demand and supply, academic and teaching qualifications, demands for \nsubject specialization, teacher incentive schemes, support from education administrators, and \nissues related to quality service provision. The information will be used to identify the extent of \nthe gap between teachers\u2019 current competencies and those expected to implement the new \ncurriculum, and interventions required for the development of an NTDF that would ensure \ncapacity for sustained development and management of well-trained teachers. \n7.  During the second phase, the TA will assist the Government in developing a policy \nframework to help articulate the NTDF by outlining its priorities for pre- and in-service teacher \ndevelopment.  The  policy  framework  will  include  minimum  standards  for  (i)   academic  and \nprofessional competencies for primary and secondary teachers and for each subject; (ii) teacher \ntraining institutional/organizational capacity to deliver appropriate types and levels of teacher \ntraining  programs;  and  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  teacher  performance  for  initial \nregistration  plus  periodic  reviews.  The  framework  will  include  (i)  guidelines  for  articulation \nbetween pre- and in-service and other professional upgrade training programs; (ii) guidelines for \naccrediting  in-service  and  professional  upgrades  to  formal  qualifications;  (iii)  guidelines  to \ndevelop  teaching  portfolios  to  evaluate  classroom-based  performance  of  teachers;  (iv) \nguidelines  to  monitor  institutional  collaboration,  joint  projects  with  schools  and/or  teacher \nprofessional organizations in respective areas; (v) guidelines for teacher remuneration and \nincentive schemes to ensure equity and fair distribution of teachers through the country; and \n(vi) guidelines for establishing a system of teacher registration and accreditation. The policy \nframework  and  procedures  will  be  developed  through  a  consultative  process  involving  all \nstakeholders. The Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture (MESC) will hold a 2-day formal \nworkshop involving technical experts, teachers, parents, private sector partners in education, \ne.g.,  National  University  of  Samoa,  church  schools,  nongovernment  organizations,  private \nschools, and other policymakers, to seek feedback from the stakeholders regarding the contents \nof the teacher development policy framework. The feedback will be incorporated in the final \nproduct covering teacher development policy reform and major activities with estimated budget, \ntime frame, and targets for teacher development for the next decade.  \n8.  Furthermore, the TA will help the Government begin the process of aligning current \nteacher training programs to the new quality, efficiency, and sustainability standard. It will help \ndevelop: (i) appropriate legislation to implement teacher registration and in-service teacher \nperformance monitoring, (ii) teacher competencies, (iii) processes for monitoring institutional \ncapacity to provide appropriate quality teacher training programs, (iv) a manual of policies and \nprocedures for national teacher development decision making, and (v) a reporting mechanism. \nThe  TA  scope  will  not  undertake  the  full  development  and  implementation  of  the  actions \nidentified, but it will provide a strong platform for MESC to work from.  ", "Appendix 3Appendix Appendix 55  39 \n9.  The consultants\u2019 will provide one comprehensive report that integrates all aspects from \ntwo individual reports for each phase. The first of the two individual reports will include (i) a brief \ndescription of the current approach to teacher development and management based on relevant \ndisaggregated data obtained for the surveys and focus groups; (ii) a detailed, but concise and \nfocused analysis of key issues related to quality, efficiency, and cost effectiveness; (iii) concise \nanalysis of causes related to the issues; and (iv) a short description of past performance of the \nGovernment  and  external  assistance  in  teacher  development  including  in-service  teacher \ntraining and lessons learned. It will (i) provide a set of quality indicators, with baseline values, \nexpected targets with time frame, and monitoring mechanism; and (ii) formulate of a set of \nrecommendations for the conceptualization and development of an NTDF.  \n10.  The  second  individual  report  will  include  policy  guidelines  including  the  rationale, \nprocesses, and exemplars for (i) developing teacher standards and competencies for primary, \nsecondary, and subject specializations; (ii) monitoring institutional standards and capacity to \ndevelop, deliver, and monitor appropriate training programs; (iii) guidelines for accrediting in-\nservice and professional upgrade programs to formal qualifications; (iv) guidelines to develop \nteaching portfolios to evaluate classroom-based performance of teachers; (v) guidelines to \nmonitor institutional collaboration, and joint projects with schools and/or teacher professional \norganizations in respective areas; and (vi) guidelines for teacher remuneration and incentive \nschemes to ensure equity and fair distribution of teachers throughout the country. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency and MESC the Implementing \nAgency for the TA. MESC will appoint a senior staff member as coordinator for all matters \npertaining to the TA. Five counterpart staff, three from MESC and two from the Faculty of \nEducation of the National University of Samoa, will be appointed to work closely with the \ninternational  consultants  to  provide  assistance  and  advice,  and  help  formulate  the  final \ndocuments. The existing Education Steering Committee will be involved to advice on all policy \nand legal issues associated with the TA. If needed the committee could be expanded to include \nmembers to oversee specific areas of TA implementation. The committee will meet at least \nthree times (at the beginning, middle, and end of TA) to provide guidance. \n12.  ADB will engage four international and five domestic consultants with experience in all \naspects of the specified scope of work. The international consultant group will comprise (i) a \nteacher education planning and institutional development specialist who will be the team leader \n(4.5 person-months), (ii) a teacher education/quality assurance specialist (3.5 person-months), \n(iii) a legislation and policy development expert (1 person-month), and (iv) a financial planning \nspecialist (1 person-month). The domestic consultants will be (i) an education administration \nand policy specialist (4 person-months), (ii) a teacher education specialist (3 person-months),(iii) \na participatory planning specialist (1.5 person-month), (iv) a teacher training specialist (2.5 \nperson-months), and (v) a finance and legal specialist (1.5 person-months). The consultants will \nbe selected through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother engagement arrangements for domestic consultants acceptable to ADB. Supplementary \nAppendix D provides the detailed terms of reference for the consultants.  \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 10 months. It is expected to start in June 2006 and be \ncompleted  by  April  2007.2  The  team  leader  and  the  teacher  education/quality  assurance \nspecialist will prepare a TA implementation plan. Within 4 weeks after starting the TA, the team \nleader will submit a brief inception report summarizing initial findings, identifying specific issues, \n                                                 \n2  Synchronizing the work of this TA to match with the teacher training activities under the loan Project will be useful \nas the TA work provides minimum standards for teacher competency at various levels of the school system and \nsubject type. \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \nand suggesting changes to the methodology and program, if any.

Monitoring and Review of General Project Activities  \n1.  Monitoring and evaluation of general project activities will be designed to assess the extent \nto which planned project activities are accomplished and outputs attained. The Government will use \nresults from monitoring and evaluation to improve performance in the Project and across the sector. \nA performance framework will be established (under component 5.3) and will be maintained by the \nMinistry of Education, Sports, and Culture (MESC). An important aspect of the framework will be to \nidentify user requirements and the types and level of information needed for effective decision \nmaking  by  the  Government,  including  the  Education  Steering  Committee  and  MESC  Core \nExecutive. \n2.  The performance framework will include the elements of monitoring and evaluation specified \nhere  for  each  component.  Further,  it  will  be  integrated  with  standard  Government  reporting \nsystems. Monitoring will be ongoing, and will be formally reported to the Government and funding \nagencies through the Project\u2019s review and forward program process. \n3.  The Government and development partners will participate in a joint program review at \nregular intervals through the life of the Project that will ideally coincide with MESC\u2019s 6-monthly \nassessment against the performance framework. A midterm and final evaluation of the Project\u2019s \nactivities will also be jointly conducted to provide information for the Government and development \npartners. \n4.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in the country  Is the sector Identified as a national priority in country poverty \npoverty analysis? Yes  partnership agreement? Yes \nContribution of sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the country: \nSamoa does not have abject poverty, but pockets of poverty and poverty of opportunity exist, including lack of education \nand access to health services, lack of economic assets and employment opportunities, social exclusion, and political \nmarginalization. Vulnerability is another major factor contributing to poverty. While the gross enrollment rate is quite high, \nnet enrollment is only 69% at the primary level, and completion rates are low. Most people lack access to quality primary \nand secondary education, resulting in high repetition and dropout rates, making the system very inefficient. Even students \nwho complete the full cycle of primary and secondary education often lack the skills required by the economy or for self-\nemployment. Thus, dropouts and out-of-school youth continuously add to the ranks of the vulnerable, ultimately falling \nprey to social ills, exclusion and poverty.  \nThe Government\u2019s education policies and strategies for 1995\u20132005 focus on major education reforms, and these have \nsuccessfully completed a number of activities. Enrollment rates in Samoa are very impressive compared with those in \nother Pacific countries. Still, the gains have not been equally shared. Poor students drop out without acquiring useful \nskills.  The  Project  will  address  the  gaps  in  the  education  sector  by  providing  better  school  facilities,  especially \nrefurbishing primary schools and expanding the unified secondary education system in poor rural areas, renewing the \nprimary curriculum, providing textbooks for secondary students, strengthening pre- and in-service teacher training \nprograms, and improving the examination and assessment system. The Project will address factors that contribute to \ndropping out and inefficiency. \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Poverty Classification: General intervention  \nUnemployment and absence and/or lack of appropriate schooling in rural and urban communities are cited as two major \ncauses of hardship among youth. An emerging trend of increased dropout rates among youth in both rural and urban \nareas is perceived, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed youth with little prospect of securing good paying \njobs. In rural areas, migration of the young population to urban areas has left large tracts of plantation lands idle. Rural \nchildren have generally more limited access to secondary education. Only 22% of the population is concentrated in \nurban Apia, and the majority (48%) of the population lives in predominantly rural areas (northwest Upolu and Savai\u2019i).1 \nEighteen of the 46 secondary schools are based in Apia with eight located in northwest Upolu. The Apia schools tend to \nbe much larger than the others, and the quality offered considered to be much better. Therefore, the demand for \nschooling in Apia is high, and as a result schools in Apia are larger. Schools in rural areas often operate from low-quality \nfacilities and learning inputs, which create considerable inequity in the access to secondary education among the \ndisadvantaged group. The Project will improve access to quality secondary education by improving school environments \nwith better classrooms, facilities, equipment, and trained teachers.  \nThe emerging pattern is dissatisfaction of communities with the poor state of health facilities and services as well as the \nstate of most school facilities in Upolu. The lack of market opportunities for agricultural produce and communication \nfacilities were the primary source of dissatisfaction for communities consulted in Savai\u2019i. Overall, the perceived lack of \ninfrastructure/services and/or poor quality, has significantly contributed to hardship in the communities. Lack of \ncommitment to customer service by government departments was perceived to be a primary reason for the nondelivery \nand/or deterioration in the quality of needed services and existing facilities.  \nConsultations identified the following community priorities to address causes of hardship in society: (i) reduction of cost \nof living, (ii) accessibility of loan assistance, (iii) support for agriculture development, (iv) provision of services and \ninfrastructure especially education, and (v) access to housing assistance. In addition, the following capacity-building \nneeds were identified to strengthen community efforts in addressing hardship in the community: (i) business skills, (ii) \ncattle-farming skills, (iii) fund raising, (iv) safe drinking water, (v) school improvement activities, (vi) nutrition education, \n(vii) road maintenance, (viii) computer literacy, and (ix) management skills for village councils.  \nThe Project would improve the delivery of education services and improve the negotiation power of the graduates. \nKnowledge on school improvement activities were identified as necessary to improve education quality for village \nchildren, while improved knowledge on nutrition will promote overall health standards for families in the villages. \nKnowledge of computer use will facilitate access to unlimited opportunities provided by information technology. The \nprimary beneficiaries will be children from rural and economically disadvantaged households. About one fifth (20.3%) of \nall  households  are  estimated  to  have  per  capita  expenditure  below  the  basic  needs  poverty  line.

Participation Process \nParticipation strategy required: Yes \nThe project design was based on broader stakeholders\u2019 participation, including key national, district, and village \npolicymakers. Consultations through focus group meetings and workshops were conducted with different education and \ntraining agencies, local leaders, civil society, communities, and nongovernment organizations. Besides workshops to \ndiscuss the issues, timely consultations with government staff were held during the technical assistance (TA). School \nteachers, principals, parents, and students were consulted during TA implementation. The timing, venue, and method of \norganizing public consultations were arranged so that disadvantaged groups can attend and have a chance to speak \nout. Special attention was paid to consultations with local people about the selection of school sites and of beneficiaries.  \nThe full participation of project beneficiaries and stakeholders in the whole project cycle started with the project design \nstage and will continue throughout project implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Special measures will ensure the \nparticipation of females and local communities in project design implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The public \nawareness campaign will support the successful implementation of new curriculum and learning assessment systems, \nparticipation for demand generation, as well as village community involvement in monitoring the upgrading of school \nfacilities and support through counterpart funding. \nD.   Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize the impact on women: Samoa has no gender disparities in access to education. In fact, more girls \nenroll in secondary schools than boys. The majority of teachers are female. However, to empower the parents, \nespecially mothers in making decision on their children\u2019s education and demand quality education, mothers will be \nincluded in e school committees.

The Macroeconomic Context \n1.  Samoa\u2019s  economy  is  open  but  small;  real  growth  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \naveraged 3.75% over the past 4 years. The medium-term outlook is for 3\u20134% economic growth. \nGovernance standards are high, with a commitment to sound macroeconomic management and \npublic sector reform. While the economy continues to rely heavily on external assistance in the \nform of grants and soft loans, the cost of servicing external debt has been declining steadily, \ndecreasing  by  11%  between  2003/04  and  2004/05.  The  economy  is  also  helped  by  large \nremittances from Samoans living overseas, primarily in Australia, New Zealand and the United \nStates. Migration for new employment amounted to 4,000\u20135,000 annually between 1998 and \n2002. The country has a clear vision for economic and social development in the medium term. \nThe Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS) for 2005\u20132007 was completed in January \n2005 and includes a commitment to restrain the annual overall budget deficit to no more than \n3.5% of GDP and to annual inflation rates of less than 3.0%. \nB.  The Sector Context \n2.  The Government has identified education as a priority area for economic and social \ndevelopment and to alleviate hardship; education is consistently the largest single item in the \nnational  budget,  averaging  16.1%  over  the  past  5  years.1  Support  to  education  typically \nrepresents over 4.5% of GDP, which is extremely high by regional and international standards.2 \nThe Education Sector Project II is clearly aligned with Government policy priorities and is directly \nresponsive to priorities articulated in the SDS. The SDS identifies seven strategic objectives in \neducation and the Project addresses six of these as follows: (i) project components 1 and 2, \nstrengthening community support for education, improving curriculum and assessment practices; \nimproving teacher quality, and supplying improved teaching materials (SDS objectives 1 through \n4); (ii) component 3, upgrading school facilities and improved equipment (SDS objective 5); and \n(iii) under components 4 and 5, strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Education, Sports \nand Culture (SDS objective 6). \n3.  Indicators point to financial stress within the education sector, despite the high level of \ngovernment support and substantial international development assistance. This is particularly the \ncase in the recurrent budget and in support to basic education. Analysis of expenditure data \ncombined with estimates of inflation, suggest that per student expenditure at the primary level \ndecreased by over 15% in the past 4 years.3 The decline in support to basic education appears to \nbe driven primarily by patterns of resource allocation within the education sector (Table A14). It \nindicates that primary\u2019s share of the total education budget has decreased from 44.2% to 35.7%, \nduring the past 4 years.  \n4.  The  high  proportion  of  the  recurrent  budget  required  to  meet  salary  costs  is also  a \nconcern. At about 95%, it is above that of most countries (with the exception of other Pacific \ncountries), limiting resources for operational expenditures. The lack of teachers in some areas is \nsignificant, especially for secondary education and the subject areas of mathematics, sciences, \nand  agriculture.  The  teaching  profession  does  not  attract  the  most  talented  and  qualified \nstudents. Both constraints are related to low wages; low esteem of teaching as a profession; and \n                                                 \n1  This excludes allocations to the Ministry of Finance whose vote covers a range of statutory commitments. In part, \neducation\u2019s share of the budget also reflects the high level of external grant assistance directed to the sector. \n2  The high share of GDP reflects, in part, the impact of external grants to education relative to other sectors. \n3  The ADB Pacific Department database has a discontinuity in base years for the consumer price index. This analysis \ncombined ADB data for 2001 through 2003 with Government of Samoa estimates of inflation for the third quarter of \n2003.  \n ", "56  Appendix 14 \nin some instances, poor working conditions. In May 2005, the Government announced substantial \nincreases in public sector salaries (ranging from 30%\u201342%). Given that salaries constitute such a \nlarge share of the education budget; these adjustments may place further strain on operating \nbudgets.  \n \nTable A14: Trends in Government Resource Allocation within the \nEducation Sector by Subsector \n(%) \nYear   Primary  Secondary  Polytech  NUS  Other \n2001  44.2  14.7  7.9  17.2  16.1 \n2002  40.8  13.4  7.7  16.1  22.0 \n2003  37.9  13.2  7.0  15.2  26.8 \n2004  35.7  13.3  7.1  15.8  28.0 \nNUS = National University of Samoa, Polytech = polytechnic. \nSource: Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Education, Sports, and Culture. \n \n5.  The Project will address the issue of nonsalary recurrent inputs in the short- to medium-\nterm under component 1. At present, provision of teaching and learning materials and in-service \nteacher training is primarily externally financed. Component 1 of the Project will provide continuity \nof these critical resources. The Government provides few resources for school maintenance as \nthis is a community responsibility. Many communities (especially rural and low-income) are not \nable to provide sufficient funds for appropriate school maintenance. The Project will ensure \nsufficient allocations for operation and maintenance at the schools supported under component 2. \nComponent 3 will strengthen policy analysis and planning and will assist the Government in \ndeveloping long-term strategies to address this issue.  \n6.  The effectiveness of project-based external assistance is a concern. Samoa\u2019s education \nsector received substantial external support under the Education Sector Project I and other \ninitiatives.4 Aid coordination and the effectiveness of these activities are also a concern. The \nGovernment  reaffirmed  that  the  Project  will  be  managed  and  implemented  under  a  single \nframework. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be assisting the Government in developing a \ncomprehensive education policy framework and strategic plan. The issues of aid coordination, \noptions for moving toward a sector-wide approach, and external on-budget support for recurrent \ncosts will be included in this initiative.  \nC.  Demand Analysis \n7.  Social  demand  for  education  is  high,  especially  at  the  secondary  level.  Although \nenrollment  in  secondary  education  is  not  compulsory,  between  1995  and  2004  secondary \nenrollment increased by 11%. At present only 43% of the secondary age cohort is enrolled and \nthe Project will help address anticipated secondary enrollment growth, especially in rural areas. In \nrural areas, when quality of education services is poor, demand diminishes as parents have to \npay for higher fees and bear other direct costs.  \n8.  The pattern of demand at the primary level is less clear. Although primary education is \ncompulsory, data suggest that net enrollment in primary education declined from 77% in 1995 to \n69% in 2004. The causes of this decline are unclear and may have implications for the demand \nfor secondary places. However, one explanation could be that the management information \nsystem reporting is not reliable. Another explanation may be that with declining quality, parents \n                                                 \n4  Appendix 3 provides a summary of external assistance. ", "Appendix 14  57 \ndo not value education. The Project will strengthen the information system and will have an \nawareness program for parents and community.  \n9.  The growth of secondary education has, in turn, led to growth in demand for places at \ntertiary institutions. This is a major factor in the increasing financial stress evidenced at the \nprimary level. The Government has placed a cap on support to the National University of Samoa. \nLittle research has been done on the price elasticity of postsecondary education and willingness \nand ability to pay fees that represent economic costs. \nD.  Economic Rationale \n10.  Internationally, the economic rationale for public sector involvement in the finance and \nprovision of basic education is well-established and applies to Samoa. International research has \ndemonstrated the high social rate of return to basic education. As of 2001 approximately 50,000 \npeople were in the formal workforce in Samoa accounting for 25% of the total workforce. Those \nemployed in the private sector and receiving higher average incomes also report higher levels of \nsecondary education (93%) and of these, 21% report postsecondary qualifications. Workers in \nthe informal sector have lower educational attainment with 61% with secondary education and \n15% with tertiary. The Government sees investment in human capital as imperative for growth: \n\u201cThe creation of employment opportunities through economic growth needs to be matched by the \ncreation of a workforce with education and skills to meet the demands of employers.\u201d  \n11.  The Samoan education system is a combination of public, church, and private providers. \nMost Government schools have a high degree of community participation in school management. \nMost primary schools and all but four secondary schools are viewed as the property of the \ncommunity with the Government providing teachers. The Project will build upon the principles of \npublic-private-partnership and strengthen delivery and improve quality in approximately 23% of \nSamoa\u2019s secondary schools. Through support of policy analysis and policy dialogue, the Project \nwill assist the Government in evaluating cost-recovery alternatives for postsecondary education, \nand in this way, will improve the economic efficiency and viability of the system. \nE.  Alternative Analysis and Efficiency Issues \n12.  In  close  consultation  with  stakeholders,  a  range  of  alternative  project  designs  were \nanalyzed. The project design reflects substantial evolution from the feasibility study, with ADB \nplaying a smaller role in the renovation and construction of the primary schools. ADB will finance \nrehabilitation and upgrading of almost all the identified secondary schools and colleges. The \nEuropean  Union  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  will  support  primary  school \nconstruction  and  rehabilitation  through  their  microfinancing  projects.  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development (AusAID) and New Zealand Agency for International Development \n(NZAID) agreed to finance activities under a redesigned component 1. \n13.  The Project will provide support to quality improvement and increasing efficiency resulting \nin learning outcomes. The sector study indicates that prior investments have not always been \neffective, especially at the primary level. One of the key findings of the review is that to achieve \nefficient and effective outcomes, all aspects of education need to be addressed suggesting \nbenefits from  adopting a singular sector  approach.  For  example,  previous  projects failed  to \nrecognize the need to retrain teachers to be able to capture the benefit of improved curricula and \nteaching materials; and likewise projects failed to address issues of attrition from schools, the \nneeds of rural pupils, and the ability to attract teachers into rural areas. Lessons from past \nprojects  also  highlight  that  while  benefits  can  be  substantial  the  lack  of  holistic  and  well-\nsequenced interventions means most projects fail to deliver expected benefits and are simply not \nsustained beyond the life of the project.  \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \nF.   Benefits and Costs \n14.  The primary beneficiaries will be children from rural and economically disadvantaged \nhouseholds. About one fifth (20.3%) of all households had per capita expenditure below the basic \nneeds poverty line. ADB will support the renovation and equipping of nine secondary schools and \nthree colleges, as well as the refurbishment of Fagaloa School to create a pilot community \nlearning center. In addition, the provision of teacher housing will increase the supply of teachers \nin disadvantaged areas.  \n15.  Education in Samoa will continue to rely on external assistance for some time. The Project \nwill be an integral part of that assistance and will provide skill strengthening for 1,900 teachers, \n300,000 student learning sets, and 10,500 teacher manuals. Further, a total of 9 secondary \nschools with a total roll of nearly 2,200 students (16% of total secondary enrollment) will be \nupgraded to provide more efficient service delivery. \n16.  The education system of Samoa serves two labor markets: internal and external. The \ninternal  labor  market  consists  of  public  sector  employment,  agriculture,  fishery  light \nmanufacturing, and the services sector (especially tourism). Overseas remittances by Samoans \nworking abroad constitute about 17.4% of national income (excluding in-kind remittances). In rural \nSamoa only 17% of households receive income from wages and salaries. Households in rural \nareas have limited access to services, and fewer opportunities for income generation. Moreover, \na  much  lower  proportion  of  households  in  remote  areas  receive  remittances  from  abroad.5 \nEducational qualifications are correlated with successful emigration. By improving education in \nrural and disadvantaged communities, the Project will contribute to poverty reduction. \nG.  Sustainability \n17.  The Project will provide bridging support to allow continuity in provision of critical quality \ninputs (including instructional materials and teacher training) that cannot be financed by the \nGovernment, in the short-term. This  will avoid  an interruption  of services  while longer term \nstrategies are developed and agreed. During the Fact-Finding Mission, a projection model was \ndeveloped to extrapolate past trends in economic growth and sector finance, and to project \nanticipated costs and resources likely to be available to the sector (Figure A14). All values are in \nconstant 2004/05 tala. The target level for resources required is set at the highest level over the \nprevious 5 years. Estimates of fiscal capacity are based on assumptions about the growth of GDP \nand education\u2019s share of GDP. Combining \u201cresource envelope\u201d projections with projections of \nlikely  future  costs  provides  a  basis  for  assessing  the  potential  for  long-term  financial \nsustainability. The model suggests that, with economic growth and continuity in education\u2019s share \nof GDP, existing programs could be sustainable from Government sources (including loans but \nexcluding grants) in about 10 to 11 years.  \nH.  Sensitivity and Risk Analyses \n18.  Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the model and a range of assumptions regarding \ninflation (provided by the International Monetary Fund and the Government) and growth of GDP \n(World Bank, ADB, and the Government) over 13 years. Projections of the time needed to attain \nfinancial sustainability are robust across the range of likely assumptions. \n                                                 \n5  Forty percent of households in Apia receive remittances, compared with 25% in rural Savai\u2019i.

A review of the financial management systems of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the \nExecuting Agency and the Ministry of Education Sports and Culture (MESC), the Implementing \nAgency, was completed during the Fact-Finding Mission (20 May to 14 June 2005). The mission \nfound that the financial management systems of MOF and MESC meet international standards for \nfinancial management, accounting, and auditing; and was confident that the systems will meet the \nrequirements of Asian Development Bank (ADB). The assessment was based on a range of prior \nanalyses:  \n2.  ADB  conducted  a  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  during  preparation  of  the \nEducation Sector Project I. The analysis concluded that \u201cADB-sponsored Treasury Institutional \nStrengthening Project has been very successful. It has led to clearly enhanced internal control \nprocedures:  these  have  facilitated  improved  internal  control  and  have  resulted  in  significant \nimprovements in transparency, accountability and disclosure. Senior staff in the Department of \nTreasury impressed as being well-qualified, serious and committed: they fully understand and \naccept that ADB's requirements must be satisfied. It is evident that co-operation between the \nDepartment of Treasury and the Department of Education works well\u201d. \n3.  Details of the assessment, which covers over 80 specific aspects of the Government\u2019s FMA \nsystem, are included in Supplementary Appendix B. \n(i)  Financial records of the Education Sector Project I was audited annually. Findings of all \nfour audits are as follows: \n\u201cOur examination was carried out in accordance with International Standards \u2026 In our \nopinion, the Statements and supporting Schedules have been properly drawn up so as \nto present fairly the Project\u2019s transactions \u2026 for the actual expenditures incurred and \nreimbursed against the Loan account.\u201d \n(ii)  ADB  reviewed  the  MOF  and  MESC  financial  management  system  as  part  of  the \nEducation Sector Project I completion report (Section B). The ADB analysis found that \nthe  Government  was  in  compliance  with  ADB  requirements  in  all  areas  of  the \nassessment. A final audit will be conducted at the end of December 2005. \n(iii)  The  World  Bank  conducted  an  FMA  of  Government  systems  in  April  2004,  in \npreparation for a cyclone emergency relief project. The objective of the assessment was \nto  determine  whether  the  project  had  in  place  an  adequate  financial  management \nsystem  as  required  by  the  World  Bank  under  OP/BP  10.02.  The  assessment \nrecommended  minor  changes  in  management  procedures  (which  have  been \nimplemented) and concluded that the project did meet minimum World Bank financial \nmanagement requirements.  \n(iv)  The ADB Fact-Finding Mission conducted an additional FMA using the ADB knowledge \nmanagement  guidelines  and  the  toolkit  checklist  for  FMA.  This  exercise  confirmed \nearlier assessments that Government systems meet international standards and are \nacceptable to ADB.
