INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  recent  years,  population  growth,  economic  development,  urbanization,  and \nenvironmental degradation have further increased the pressure on the freshwater resources of \nAsia and the Pacific. The challenges of water management have also been made more complex \nby climate change. As a result, the region has suffered the highest incidence and damage from \nwater-related disasters including floods, droughts, storm surges, and pollution. Water scarcity \nand pollution have also increased the costs of providing access to safe drinking water services \nand basic sanitation.  \n \n2.  Water security, along with food and energy security, has therefore become a political \nissue for many governments in the region, and a pressing concern to water users, practitioners, \nand  leaders.  Water  security  is  fundamental  to  sustainable  development  in  households, \ncommunities, cities, river basins, and national economies sectors. To increase water security for \nall stakeholders, an integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach is needed that \nreaches across sectors and jurisdictions, and develops solutions with stakeholders within the \ncontext  of  river  basins,  groundwater  aquifers,  or  islands  as  hydrological  units. IWRM  is  a \ncornerstone of the Water for All policy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopted in 2001. \n \n3.  To support the introduction of IWRM in the region, the Network of Asian River Basin \nOrganizations (NARBO) was established in 2004 by ADB, Japan Water Agency (JWA), and \nADB  Institute,  who  jointly  serve  as  NARBO's  secretariat,  led  by  JWA.1  NARBO  works  to \nstrengthen the capacity and effectiveness of river basin organizations (RBOs) in promoting \nIWRM and improving water governance through training and exchange of information and \nexperience. In addition, the ADB Water Financing Program is helping introduce IWRM in 25 \nriver basins across Asia through technical assistance (TA) and various investment projects.  \n \n4.  In 2009, the presidents of ADB and JWA signed a letter of intent for further collaboration \nin strengthening IWRM in river basins through Water Financing Program investment projects \nand  demonstration  projects  to  improve  water  security  in three  river basins,  with  long-term \ninvestment road maps and best practices that can be replicated elsewhere in the region. Such \ndemonstration projects are expected to provide ADB's developing member countries (DMCs) \nwith more knowledge, new perspectives, and innovative methods to manage water to support \nproductive  economies  in  agriculture,  industry,  and  energy;  to  restore  healthy  rivers  and \necosystems; and to build resilient communities that can adapt to changes, including climate \nchange. \n \n5.  The  governments  of  Indonesia,  Nepal,  and  Uzbekistan  have  expressed  interest  in \ncollaborating  with  ADB  and  JWA  in  developing  demonstration  projects  to  improve  water \nsecurity. Through this proposed regional TA, they hope to lay the foundation for subsequent \nfeasibility studies of investment projects and for demonstrating associated best practices to \nleaders and practitioners in partnership with ADB and JWA. The proposed TA received concept \nclearance from ADB Management in July 2009.2\n \nII.  ISSUES \n6.  A range of water security issues are vital to DMCs, including the increase of floods and \ndroughts, degradation of water quality in surface and groundwater, loss of ecosystem services, \n                                                 \n1   As of February 2010, NARBO has 71 member organizations from 16 countries.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 15 March 2010.  \n ", "2   \npoor condition of water resources infrastructure, lack of experience and institutional capacity for \nwater allocation, and generally weak governance systems to deliver water services and to \nmanage water resources. Moreover, these issues are typically interrelated, which makes the \nchallenges more complex. For example, water pollution in rivers and groundwater makes the \ntreatment of water for drinking more expensive, resulting in overall lower water security. While \nmost countries in the region have already adopted national water policies that advocate IWRM \nin river basins, implementation is now the main challenge. \n \n7.  In Indonesia, the Solo River Basin has conditions and challenges that are typical in \nSoutheast  Asian  countries  affected  by  the  monsoon  climate.  The  river  is  shared  by  two \nprovinces,  Central  and  East  Java,  and  suffers  from  severe  degradation  of  the  watershed, \nresulting in erosion and massive sedimentation in the upper and middle reaches. Due to rapid \neconomic  development  and  population  growth,  the  middle  and  lower  reaches  suffer  from \nincreasing floods, deteriorating water quality, and disputes about water allocation among urban \nand agricultural uses during the dry season.  \n \n8.  Indonesia has given high priority to developing solutions to increase water security in \nriver basins through an IWRM process comprising watershed management, restoration of water \nstorage capacity, river improvement works in the mainstream and tributaries, and rehabilitation \nof water infrastructure to allocate water and to manage floods. The government is pilot testing \nthe establishment of a river basin water council to oversee the implementation of the IWRM \nprocess in the Solo River Basin, and has established, with assistance from ADB and the \nGovernment of Japan, a national and regional knowledge hub for river basin management in \nSolo City.3 Stakeholders are now finalizing river basin plans that address severe problems of \nfloods, pollution, sedimentation, and competition for water, to increase water security.4  \n \n9.  In Nepal, the Bagmati River Basin is confronting issues that are typical for mountainous \nregions in Asia. The river's upper reach in the Kathmandu Valley suffers from serious water \nshortages,  pollution,  and  land  encroachment.  The  middle  reach  is  enduring  watershed \ndegradation  and  acute  water  shortages  that  exacerbate  poverty,  while  the  lower  reach \nwitnesses  frequent  flooding  and  severe  bank  erosion.  To  improve  river  management,  the \ngovernment has established a multidisciplinary committee, the Bagmati Civilization Integrated \nDevelopment Committee (BCIDC), which is expected to become the country's first effective \nRBO. Under the Bagmati Action Plan, the government has started to address water and related \nsoil, land, and environmental issues in the upper reach in an integrated manner. This work \nneeds to be expanded to include investments for the middle and lower reaches to address water \nsecurity through a basin-wide perspective. \n \n10.  In Uzbekistan, which lies in the middle reach of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya river \nbasins, deteriorating infrastructure\u2014including dams, weirs, and dikes\u2014is making allocation and \nwater services difficult to manage during water scarcity and floods. Central Asia features the \nregion's  highest  rates  of  available  water  resources  use;  thus,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to \n                                                 \n3  The knowledge hub in Solo City comprises (i) the Dissemination Unit for Water Resources Management and \nTechnology, supported by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, for capacity development in RBOs in \nIndonesia; and (ii) the Center for River Basin Organizations and Management, supported by ADB, serving as a \nregional knowledge hub for NARBO and the Asia\u2013Pacific Water Forum.  \n4  A road map will be finalized under ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Managing Water in Asia's River Basins: \nCharting Progress and Facilitating Investment. Manila (TA 6470\u2013REG). A flood management strategy will be \nimproved and implemented under ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Supporting Investments in Water-Related \nDisaster Management. Manila (TA 7276\u2013REG).  \n ", "  3\nmodernize and to improve the management and development of water resources.5 ADB is \nalready providing regional TA to the riparian countries to update their collaboration framework \nfor  the  sustainable  use  of  the  Syr  Darya  River's  water  and  energy  resources.6  Within \nUzbekistan, the government is prioritizing diagnostic studies to determine how the country's \nwater  resources  infrastructure  can  best  be  modernized  with  up-to-date  management  and \nmonitoring systems and higher safety standards. To support water resources decision making \nand  climate  change  adaptation,  improvements  are  also  needed  in  the  collection  and \nmanagement of hydrometeorological and water use data. These investments will increase water \nsecurity in Uzbekistan and are likely to demonstrate best practices that can also benefit the \nrehabilitation and modernization of water management in other riparian countries. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  proposed  TA  aims  to  accelerate  economic  growth  and  to  improve  the  living \nstandards  in  river  basins  through  efficient,  effective,  and  sustainable  water  resources \nmanagement, environmental conservation, and water-related disaster risk mitigation. The TA \nwill help identify investment needs in preparation for future feasibility studies for projects to \nincrease water security in three pilot river basins in the region. The TA will also strengthen the \ncapacity of government agencies and other stakeholders concerned for the implementation of \nthe future investment programs. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The proposed TA will have two components: (i) preparation for future water resources \nmanagement  programs  that  combine  structural  and  non-structural  investments  to  increase \nwater security in three pilot basin areas and to improve existing river basin management plans; \nand (ii) in-country and regional capacity development activities to prepare government agencies, \nRBOs, and other stakeholders for these future investment programs, including demonstration \nactivities to start implementing innovative approaches to increase water security in the three \nbasins. \n \n13.  Preparation for future investment programs. With the respective RBOs and agencies \nconcerned, prefeasibility studies will be prepared in the pilot river basins of (i) Solo in Indonesia, \n(ii) Bagmati in Nepal, and (iii) Syr Darya in Uzbekistan.7 RBOs and related agencies will be \nprovided with advisory support for (i) preparing updated river basin profiles; (ii) identifying \npriority activities and projects to increase water security in each river basin, which are expected \nto  include  flood  forecasting  and  management,  drought  management  and  water  allocation, \npollution control, and other priority areas; and (iii) improving existing river basin management \n                                                 \n5  The management of transboundary water resources in the Syr Darya River Basin changed after the collapse of the \nSoviet Union in 1991. During the Soviet period, water use in upstream countries (generating hydroelectric power) \nand downstream countries (engaging in agriculture and supplying fossil fuel to upstream countries in winter) was \nguided  by  the  central  government.  After  the  republics  gained  independence  and  introduced  market-based \neconomies, including for fossil fuels, this arrangement became difficult to maintain.  \n6  Dialogues and institutional strengthening to enhance regional cooperation on water management in the Syr Darya \nRiver Basin is being facilitated under ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Improved Management of Water \nResources in Central Asia. Manila (TA 6486\u2013REG). \n7  These three river basins have been selected because of their acute water security challenges, and the future \noperational perspective in each sub-region. In this TA, a prefeasibility study will assess existing river management \nplans, including long-term investment programs or outputs of past studies from a water security improvement \nperspective and prioritize them. \n ", "4   \nplans. It is expected that the TA outputs will be used in the design of future project preparatory \nTA for feasibility studies of water security investment projects in the three river basins. \n \n14.  In Indonesia, the TA will (i) assess investment requirements and identify project activities \nto  improve  water  security  in  the  Solo  River  Basin  through  water  allocation,  distribution, \nconservation,  and  flood  management;  (ii)  conduct  studies  and  demonstration  activities  to \nincrease water security in support of a road map for a long-term IWRM investment program in \nthe river basin; and (iii) organize stakeholder workshops for the water security studies. \n \n15.  In Nepal, the TA will (i) advise on how to strengthen the existing Bagmati Action Plan to \nimprove  water  governance  in  the  river  basin;  (ii)  conduct  water  security  studies  and \ndemonstration activities under this action plan; (iii) help expand the action plan to increase water \nsecurity in the middle and lower reaches, drawing on the results of past studies and projects \nand  consultations  with  stakeholders;  (iv)  assist  in  prioritizing  the  action  plan's  candidate \ninvestment and capacity-building projects into an IWRM investment program; and (v) organize \nstakeholder workshops for the water security studies. \n \n16.  In Uzbekistan, the TA will (i) assess national IWRM progress and identify priority water \nsecurity issues, (ii) conduct studies aimed at improving water security in the Syr Darya River \nBasin,  and (iii)  organize  stakeholder  workshops  for  the studies.  Water  security  issues  are \nexpected to include the modernization of infrastructure for water resources allocation and the \nprovision of water services, including data and monitoring systems for sustainable water use.  \n \n17.  Capacity development. The capacity of RBOs and related agencies in the three river \nbasins will be strengthened for planning and implementing the IWRM investment programs. \nRegional  exchange  of  information  and  experience  and  knowledge  networking  will  also  be \nfacilitated  so  that  lessons  learned  can  be  disseminated  among  interested  DMCs  and \ndevelopment partners in the region, including NARBO members. The TA outputs will be used by \nADB, NARBO, and the regional water knowledge hubs to promote IWRM processes that can \nhelp increase water security in river basins in the region. \n \n18.  In Indonesia, the TA will strengthen the capacity of the Solo RBO and related agencies \nto  improve  water  security  through  water  allocation,  distribution,  conservation,  and  flood \nmanagement. In Nepal, the TA will strengthen the capacity of BCIDC to serve as the RBO for \nthe entire Bagmati River Basin, and to address water security issues such as water pollution, \nallocation, and flood management. In Uzbekistan, the TA will strengthen the capacity of the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Water Resources, the Syr Darya RBO, the State Inspectorate for \nSafety of Hydrotechnical Facilities, and other related stakeholders to address water security \nissues. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.43 million, of which $2.00 million will be financed by ADB \non a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. JWA will \ncontribute  $0.43  million  equivalent  through  in-kind  support  for  office  accommodation  and \nNARBO activities. The cost estimates are shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB, through the Sustainable Infrastructure Division of the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, will be the executing agency, in collaboration with the Basin Water \n ", "  5\nStream of ADB's Water Community of Practice, regional departments and resident missions \nconcerned. Team members from the regional departments will coordinate implementation of in-\ncountry TA activities. JWA will be the implementing agency, in accordance with its mandate as \nNARBO secretariat, to support regional knowledge networking and capacity building for IWRM \nto increase water security in river basins. It will also use its extensive experience in water \nresources  development  and  management,  including  river  basin  planning,  water  use  and \nallocation,  facility  management,  and  water-related  disaster  management  in  various  DMCs. \nCounterpart agencies will include the Ministry of Public Works in Indonesia, BCIDC in Nepal, \nand  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  in  Uzbekistan.  Throughout  the \nimplementation of the TA's in-country and regional components, JWA will collaborate closely \nwith  ADB  headquarters,  resident  missions,  and  counterpart  agencies.  The  funding  and \nimplementation of the TA are subject to (i) signing of a TA agreement between ADB and JWA; \n(ii) receipt by ADB of no-objection letters from the governments of the DMCs concerned; and (iii) \napproval by ADB of a detailed work program for each component. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from June 2010 to May 2012. JWA will \nsubmit to ADB (i) an inception report; (ii) an interim report, (iii) semiannual financial statements \naccounting for the use of project funds; (iv) audited annual financial statements, including the \nuse of project funds; and (v) a final report incorporating the comments of the project clients and \nADB. JWA will provide about 81 person-months of expert services over a two-year period, \nincluding 46 person-months of international experts (34 person-months of JWA's experts and 12 \nperson-months of consultants) and 35 person-months of national consultants, with expertise in \nwater resources management, water allocation, facilities operation and maintenance, IWRM \ntraining,  river  management,  water  governance  (law  and  institutional  development),  and \nwastewater management.  \n \n22.
