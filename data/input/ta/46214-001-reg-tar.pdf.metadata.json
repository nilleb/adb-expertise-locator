INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA)1 responds to the needs of Asian Development \nBank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs) in South Asia regarding two key aspects of \ndevelopment work: (i) enhanced monitoring and analysis of macroeconomic indicators to help \ndecision makers in Bhutan, the Maldives, and Nepal make better-informed policies and (ii) \nencouraging South Asian DMCs2 to learn from one another\u2019s development experiences, and \nthose of other regions, in areas of concern, such as unplanned urbanization, food security, and \nlabor and skills issues. This latter aspect regarding South\u2013South learning is increasingly critical \nto leverage the development experiences of countries in the region. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  South  Asian  countries  have  embarked  on  various  trade,  investment,  and  financial \nreforms since the early 1990s that have integrated their economies regionally and globally more \nthan ever before. Linking to global and regional economies has underpinned recent robust \ngrowth in individual South Asian economies that ranks South Asia as one of the fastest-growing \nregions in the world.4  Some of the region\u2019s economies are increasingly present in global finance \nand trade. However, the region continues to be home to more than 40% of the world\u2019s poor, \nwho continue to be isolated from the benefits of economic expansion.5 Unfortunately, the poor \nare exposed to downstream risks brought on by local and global shocks and crises, such as the \ncommodity  price  shock  as  food  and  oil  prices  spiked  in  2007,  leaving  poor  South  Asian \nhouseholds highly vulnerable.6 Meanwhile, binding constraints that impinge on sector-based \ndevelopment continue to challenge opportunities for inclusive growth and undermine economies\u2019 \ncapability to maintain robust growth. The growing exposure of the South Asian economies to \nglobal  economic  trends\u2014and  countries\u2019  opportunities  and  risks  faced  addressing  binding \nconstraints\u2014calls  for  the  reasonably  regular  surveillance  of  macroeconomic  developments, \nthorough review of development challenges, and timely provision of good economic policy \nadvice as the economic situation warrants to help policy makers minimize downside risks and \nharness opportunities for support growth and inclusiveness. This TA responds to this demand.     \n \n3.  To enhance the capacity of policy makers in the region to formulate effective measures \nin  a  timely  manner,  it  is  critical  to  improve  access  to  economic  updates  and  analytical \nassessment on the emerging issues and to share them broadly. Even as the economies of the \nDMCs of South Asia are becoming increasingly integrated, the issue of limited and irregular \nmacroeconomic surveillance in the smaller economies of the region needs to be addressed. \nThey should also have ready research support to tap to as to be able to access prompt \neconomic policy advice to face challenges and crises that require immediate response. In this \nmanner, the TA hopes to lessen the number and intensity of economic shocks that leave the \npoor exposed and vulnerable.  \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 August 2012.  \n2 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \n3 The vice-president for operations 1 approved the TA concept paper on 28 August 2012. \n4 Bangladesh has grown by an average of 6.2% in the past 5 years, Bhutan by 9.3%, India by 7.9%, the Maldives by \n6.3%, Nepal by 4.0%, and Sri Lanka by 6.5%. ADB. 2012. Asian Development Outlook 2012: Confronting Rising \nInequality in Asia. Manila \n5 ADB. 2008. South Asia Development and Cooperation Report. New Delhi. \n6  ADB. 2010. The Impact of the Global Crisis on South Asia. Manila. ", "2 \n4.  As  stated  in  Strategy  2020,  ADB  intends  to  pursue  complementary  agendas  that \nencompass inclusive growth and regional integration.7 This TA supports the strategy by (i) \nproviding  economic  research  support  to  DMCs  for  a  deeper  understanding  of  immediate \neconomic  issues  and  concerns;  (ii)  helping  DMCs  gain  regular  access  to  information  on \nmeasurable economic indicators; (iii) providing regular updates and analyses of macroeconomic \ntrends;  and  (iv)  sharing  insights  on\u2014and  learning  from\u2014the  experiences  of  neighboring \neconomies in the form of South\u2013South learning to address development challenges. Moreover, \nlessons  on  how  ADB  reports  and  publications  and  other  knowledge  products  from  ADB \nprograms (such as impact evaluations) helped DMC governments shape policy responses to \nemerging needs and challenges can be used as reference for ongoing and succeeding TA \nprojects.8 \n  \n5.  Meanwhile, the TA supports the priorities of all six DMCs in the region as reflected in \ntheir country partnership strategies since macroeconomic surveillance is at the core of these \nstrategies. It supports the South Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy, 2011\u20132015 by promoting \nregional cooperation and integration largely by facilitating knowledge sharing among DMCs.9 \nExperience from related prior assistance (such as on strengthening capacity for macroeconomic \nanalysis in Nepal in 2008) has demonstrated the need for the type of assistance being planned \nhere.  And an  existing  regional  TA  project on  knowledge  management  focuses  on  sharing \nknowledge  on  broad  development  issues  including  planning,  political  economy,  and  public \npolicy,10 but what is missing is the critical macroeconomic surveillance and analysis work as well \nas core economic sector research that will guide policy makers in the region. These are issues \nthat have been raised by the DMCs of the region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n\u00a0\n6.  The impact of the TA will be better-informed and better-developed policies on economic \nmanagement and economic risk mitigation in South Asian DMCs. The outcome of the TA will be \ngreater access to timely and rigorous analysis of macroeconomic data and economic studies as \nwell as knowledge of development issues based on the experiences of various countries. This \nwill help governments manage their economies more effectively. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  This TA intends to (i) expand ADB\u2019s existing research products with greater emphasis on \npolicy implications and (ii) enhance the dissemination of research outputs on South Asian \ncountries. The TA will have three major outputs with corresponding activities: \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila \n8 The support to be provided to the DMCs is a critical component of their need for \u201cfinance++\u201d engagement with ADB. \nThis form of value-added engagement focuses on ideas and sound advice that is at the core of knowledge \nmanagement work. \n9   ADB. 2011. South Asia: Regional Cooperation Strategy, 2011\u20132015. Manila \n10 ADB. 2011. Strengthening Knowledge-Driven Development in South Asia. Manila. Similar work by the ADB \nEconomics and Research Department produces each year the Asian Development Outlook and its Update, but \nthese publications do not delve into the details of any particular policy constraint or extensively cover economic \nissues in Bhutan and the Maldives. The TA will help fill this knowledge gap, thereby expanding ADB\u2019s suite of \nresearch outputs.  \n ", "3 \n(i)  Improved  macroeconomic  surveillance  work  and  analysis.  To  enhance \nmacroeconomic surveillance in Bhutan, the Maldives, and Nepal, an economic \nupdate report and accompanying macroeconomic database will be published \nbiannually for these countries.11  As economic data for these countries are scant, \npatchy, and unavailable on commercial databases, the TA aims to keep policy \nmakers informed of economic developments in their countries by providing a \nconsolidated analysis on the most recent macroeconomic data and economic \nupdates gathered from their government agencies and ministries.12 The TA will \nprovide a venue for analysis of higher-frequency data (e.g., inflation, foreign \nexchange reserves, and balance of payments) essential to policy making. The \nconsolidated data, which will be stored and maintained in Microsoft Excel for \neasy dissemination to DMC governments, will be uploaded to the South Asia \nDepartment (SARD) intranet and shared with agencies and ministries along with \nthe  economic  update.  Through  the  update,  the  TA  will  provide  economic \nguideposts,  especially  during  turbulent  times,  to  help  policy  makers  shape \nappropriate  policy  responses  to  challenges.  This  component  will  strengthen \ncapacity in selected South Asian DMCs for macroeconomic surveillance through \nworkshops and South\u2013South learning from other regions.13  \n \n(ii)  Major  development  challenges  reviewed.  This  component  will  see  the \npublication of at least two flagship knowledge products on themes of significance \nto the region.14 The themes for analysis will be selected by the project steering \ncommittee in consultation with DMC governments and ADB sector divisions. \nExperts will be mobilized to analyze the selected topics and engage extensively \nwith  key  stakeholders  throughout  the  region,  including  representatives  of \ngovernment  ministries  and  agencies,  development  partners,  civil  society,  the \nprivate sector, think tanks, and academic and research institutions. A workshop \nwill be conducted for each flagship publication to disseminate lessons. \n \n(iii)  Improved quality of economic policy advice provided. This component will \nprovide standby research support for policy needs that require immediate redress \n(e.g., the recent rupee liquidity crunch in Bhutan or a food crisis). Upon the \nrequest of DMC governments, the policy advice component of the TA will assess \nand analyze development issues faced by DMCs toward formulating policy to \naddress  them.  Researchers  will  be  engaged  for  this  work  as  needed,  and \nexperience will be gleaned from South\u2013South learning. The economic issues to \nbe analyzed will be determined on an ongoing basis during the TA in response to \na DMC soliciting policy advice. \n \n8.  The main assumptions in the TA are (i) DMC governments participating in policy debates \nin response to economic challenges, (ii) DMC governments\u2019 commitment to transparency with \nnational stakeholders, and (iii) governments\u2019 diligence in releasing necessary economic data \n                                                 \n11 Other South Asian countries have regularly published economic reports: Bangladesh Quarterly Economic Update, \nSri Lanka Quarterly Economic Update, and Bangladesh and India country chapters in the Asian Development \nOutlook Update. \n1T2 hCee nvtireawl bsa enxkps,r emsinsiesdtr iehse roef ifnin aanrec et,h sotsaetis otifc sth aeg ecnocniessu latannd tb aunreda udso,  nanodt  nceencterasls palrainlyn irnegp mreisneisntrti etsh.o se of ADB\u2019s \n1m3 Memacbreoersc,o Bnoomaircd  soufr vDeiirlelacntcoer sw, iMll aconnatgineume ebnety,o onrd s TtaAf fc, laonsidn gm tahyro bugeh p trheeli mefifnoartrsy  oinf  rneasitduernet.  m  issions and SARC \nfocal points in Bhutan and the Maldives. \n14 Themes could include, for example, the subjects for discussion at the 2013 ADB Annual Meeting of the Board of \nGovernors, to be held in India. Other potential themes include urbanization, jobs and skills, inflation, food security, \nand energy.    \n ", "4 \nand reports on time. The risk to the TA is the possible weakening of political consensus and \npolicy continuity and consistency due to changes in government leadership. The project has no \nanticipated  social  or  environmental  constraints  or  concerns  regarding  public  finance \nmanagement,  procurement,  or  corruption.  The  primary  risk-mitigation  measure  will  be \ncontinuous engagement with governments to ensure the release of information and acceptance \nof the policy advice rendered. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. Activities under this TA will be undertaken only in participating South Asian \nDMCs from which no-objection letters have been obtained.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  Executing and implementing agencies. ADB will be the executing agency, and the \nRegional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division (SARC) of SARD will be the focal \npoint for the TA in close coordination with participating SARD resident missions and sector \ndivisions, as well as other ADB departments.15  \n \n11.  Project steering committee. The project steering committee will be chaired by the \nSARC director and include country economists in sector divisions and resident missions.16  The \ncommittee will meet every 4 months, at which time representatives from departments other than \nSARD may be invited to join as necessary. Day-to-day TA operations will be under the guidance \nof the ADB project team leader in SARC,  with the active involvement of the international \nconsultant recruited as the TA team leader and lead economist. \n \n12.
