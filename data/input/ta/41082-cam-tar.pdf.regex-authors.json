The Government of Cambodia faces significant challenges in its efforts to reduce poverty. \nThe National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2006\u20132010, the Government\u2019s third national 5- \nyear plan, translates the development vision of the Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, \nEquity,  and  Efficiency  (2003\u20132008)  and  reflects  the  Government\u2019s  clear  poverty  focus.  The \nRectangular Strategy had identified the need for capacity building for public financial management \n(PFM) as key to achieving long-term poverty reduction and had regarded governance as the most \nimportant precondition for economic development in Cambodia. The Government requested Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  grant  assistance  to  strengthen  PFM  in  the  line  ministries  that  are \nsupporting rural development by assessing the ongoing PFM reforms in those ministries so as to \nidentify areas of strategic focus for consolidating the current reforms and to prepare the groundwork \nfor future reforms in a sequenced and prioritized framework.1 The National Audit Authority (NAA) of \nCambodia also requested ADB to strengthen the state audit function in PFM reforms. \n \n2.  The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is part of ADB\u2019s support to design the grant \nproject for Strengthening of Public Financial Management for Rural Development Project (SPFMRD) \nfor Cambodia and reflects ADB\u2019s continuous support to PFM reforms.2 Conceptualization of this \nassistance was based on lessons learned from the implementation of ongoing projects and audit \nrecommendations that underlined major weaknesses in internal control and procurement practices.3   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Governance. Weak governance is a major obstacle that prevents Cambodia from achieving \neconomic  growth,  inclusive  social  development,  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Government  has \nrecognized corruption as a challenge and has given priority to governance reform in key policy \ndocuments, including the Rectangular Strategy and the NSDP 2006\u20132010. Cambodia joined the \nAsian Development Bank-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (ADB-OECD) \nAnti-Corruption Initiative and Action Plan for Asia and the Pacific in 2003. Following ADB's adoption \nof  the  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan  (GACAP  II)  2005\u20132008  in  2006, \nCambodia agreed in April 2007 to participate in regional technical assistance (RETA) 6385 on \nGovernance and Capacity Development initiatives to implement GACAP II. \n \n4.  CSP and Good Governance. Good governance is at the core of ADB\u2019s strategic focus. The \ncountry strategy and program (CSP) 2005\u20132009 and the CSP midterm review (2007\u20132009)4 for \nCambodia  have  highlighted  the  need  for  good  governance  to  improve  responsiveness,  cost-\neffectiveness, efficiency, and quality of public service delivery, especially to the poor. The CSP has \nidentified the weak capacity for PFM, poor domestic resource mobilization effort, inefficient allocation \nof  public  expenditure  for  development  priorities  as  well  as  weak  linkages  among  policies, \n                                                 \n1  Rural development would include support inter alia to Ministry of Rural Development; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry \nand Fisheries; Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology. \n2   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 14 September 2007. \n3   ADB. 2003.

Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP). The Government launched the \nPFMRP in December 2004 to address the problems. The PFMRP, supported by a multiagency trust \nfund, is a 10-year comprehensive reform program. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is \nthe lead agency responsible for its implementation. The PFMRP utilizes a platform approach to \nimplement a package of measures for increasing levels (platform) of PFM competence over a \nmanageable  timeframe  (Box  1).  The  program  seeks  to  make  the  budget  credible  as  a  policy \ninstrument and focuses on measures like delivering resources reliably to budget managers; to \nimprove  the  linkages  between  policy  priorities,  budget  planning,  and  implementation;  and  to \nintegrate accountability and reporting of performance against the budget and program objectives, to \nensure greater external transparency.  \nBox 1: PFMRP Platform Approach \n \nPlatform 1: Make the budget more credible in terms of timely and predictable delivery of funds \n(including  improving  the  comprehensiveness  of  the  budget;  strengthening  macro-fiscal  and \nrevenue  forecasting,  and  streamlining  spending  processes).  Platform  2:  Implement  effective \nfinancial accountability. Platform 3: Achieve a fully affordable policy agenda through a policy-\nbudget linkage. Platform 4: Achieve effective program performance accountability. \n \nSource: PFM Reform Program, MEF, Royal Government of Cambodia. 2004. \n \n6.  At  a  retreat  in  April  2007  where  an  External  Advisory  Panel  (EAP)  report    assessing  \nprogress was discussed, the Government and development partners agreed that over the period \n2005\u20132006,  significant  progress  had  been  made  on  the  completion  of  Platform  1  (credible \nbudgeting) by MEF, and MEF and the line ministries should expeditiously complete and deepen \nPlatform 1 activities. At the same time, planning for Platform 2 should commence.6 The 2007 EAP \nassessment recognized the challenge of rolling out PFM reform to line ministries. The Government \nis aware that full implementation of PFM reforms across all ministries will be a long drawn-out \nprocess and developing the capacity of the line ministries is critical to the successful implementation \nof the PFMRP.  \n \n7.   PFM for Rural Development. With poverty concentrated in agriculture and the rural sector, \nthe Government\u2019s strategy for enhancing growth, employment generation, and poverty reduction \nenvisages the need for significant public expenditures for rural development with a corresponding \nneed for adequate expenditure management and control mechanisms. Inroads into poverty require \nappropriate policies and institutions, including identification of poverty-reducing spending in the \nbudget. In addition, parallel progress in strengthening links with PFM as a major crosscutting agenda. \nis needed. The institutional framework supporting rural development, therefore, requires sustained \nsupport in PFM mechanisms. No previous TA has addressed PFM reform specifically for the rural \ndevelopment sector. The ongoing PFMRP has a government-wide focus and has so far been \nconcentrated  in  MEF,  and  the  rollout  to  line  ministries  has  not  been  satisfactory.  Given  this \nbackground, the TA will support a sector-wide PFM reform program in rural development that is \nconsistent with CSP priorities and potential future support to the rural development sector. The 2003 \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2007. Country Strategy and Program 2005\u20132009, Cambodia. Manila. \n6  The indicative activities and objectives of Platform 2 include (i) improved accountability lines\u2015clarifying roles, functions, \nand responsibilities between levels of Government; (ii) improved accounting\u2015initial consolidation of accounting data, \nand improved reconciliation procedures; (iii) improved reporting\u2015interim improvements in reporting of performance \nagainst the budget; and (iv) strengthened capacity for both internal and external audit.  ", "  3\nIntegrated  Fiduciary  Assessment  and  Public  Expenditure  Review  (IFAPER)  and  the  recent \ngovernance risk assessments of the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) and the Ministry of Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM)  provide  a  detailed  diagnosis  of  the  key  governance \nconstraints and underline the need for substantial improvements in the institutions, processes, and \ncapabilities relating to PFM. The rollout of the PFMRP, in this context, will be a fundamental risk \nmitigation measure.  \n \n8.  Institutional  Strengthening  and  Accountability.  Strengthening  the  institutions  of \naccountability facilitates good governance. The supreme audit institution (SAI) of a country is a \ncritical  pillar  of  the  system  of  institutional  check  and  balance.  It  provides  credible,  verifiable, \nindependent  information  and  institutional  safeguards  against  malfeasance  and  abuse  of  public \nmoney,  thus  facilitating  good  governance.  The  Government  has  made  major  progress  toward \nestablishing accountability and oversight mechanisms. Previous support from ADB and aid agencies \nhas (i) strengthened the Finance and Banking Commission (FBC) of the National Assembly, and (ii) \nset up NAA as the supreme audit institution in Cambodia, with a legal mandate conferred by the \nAudit Law in March 2000. The Audit Law also has provisions for the interface between NAA and \ninternal audit agencies.7 A priority in Cambodia is to strengthen NAA, including its capacity to \nundertake a performance audit of social sector spending, rural development projects, public works, \nand  public  contracts,  within  the  framework  of  the  International  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit \nInstitutions (INTOSAI) international standards. A well-organized independent audit system with a \nstrong mandate and financial autonomy, and vested with explicit rights and obligations to report its \naudit findings and recommendations will contribute to greater transparency and accountability. The \ninternal audit function in most line ministries is also underdeveloped, having received little or no \nexternal support, despite an internal audit subdecree. Internal audit capability therefore needs to be \nstrengthened in MRD, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), and MOWRAM and in \nits constituent administrative establishments in provinces and districts since an effective internal \naudit  establishment  strengthens  internal  control  processes,  provides  strong  assurance,  and \nminimizes risks.  \n \n9.  The Government\u2019s priority focus on rural development and its desire for ADB to lead in this \narea will require a strong institutional reform program for rural development in line ministries focused \non PFM. The timing of the TA is therefore appropriate. The TA will support efforts in meeting the \nbenchmarks in PFM essential to achieving efficiency in resource allocation in the rural development \nsector. The benefits will be manifested in improved service delivery to the rural population. Improved \ngovernance and more transparent and accountable management of public resources arising from \nthe  project  will  provide  the  basis  for  higher  and  more  efficient  public  expenditures  in  rural \ndevelopment and greater poverty reduction.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be to strengthen PFM in the rural development sector as a basic \nbuilding block for improving service delivery and eradicating poverty in Cambodia. The  outcome will \nbe an agreed-upon design for a grant project, which will include (i) a road map for institutional \ndevelopment in three line ministries (MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM); and (ii) a road map for the \nstrengthening of NAA and its capacity to undertake a performance audit of social sector spending in \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Strengthening Public Financial Management. Manila \n(TA 3634-CAM, approved on 22 February), which was completed at the end of November 2005. This TA helped support \nthe internal audit subdecree approved in February 2005.   \n ", "4   \nthe field of rural development. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The initial \npoverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will build on the framework of the ongoing PFM reform measures and will involve \nclose aid coordination and alignment with the consolidated action plan of the PFMRP platform \napproach. The project design, resulting from institutional assessments and diagnostics, will draw \nupon lessons from existing analytical work and incorporate feedback from stakeholder consultations. \nThe TA will identify a set of specific measures to implement the ongoing PFM reform program \nactivities,  and  recommend  areas  of  support  for  MRD,  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  NAA  including \norganizational  and  capacity  development  components  critical  for  deepening  PFM  reforms.  In \nconsultation with the Government, development partners, and NAA, the TA will assess the role of \nNAA under the SPFMRD as well as the need for further institutional strengthening to improve audit \noversight, especially in the rural development sector. The TA will develop modalities for providing \nfinancial and technical support for the ensuing grant to the finance and internal audit departments of \nthe three line ministries, provincial departments, and other relevant units, with a clear set of selection \ncriteria and guidelines for project implementation. The TA will also assess the resource allocation for \nNAA\u2019s participation in the grant project and will identify potential areas for broad-based participation \nof civil society organizations in the PFM reform process. \n \n12.  The TA will have three outputs. \n \n(i)  Institutional assessment and diagnostic review. The assessment and review will \nconsist of (a) analysis of  progress in rolling out PFM reforms to the three line \nministries  MRD,  MAFF;  and  MOWRAM;  (b)  identification  of  the  institutional \nconstraints in implementing reform measures; and (c) a road map for consolidating \nreforms initiated in Platform I, and for undertaking future reforms in the context of \ndecentralization and deconcentration reforms. A comparative study of the progress of \ninternal audit functions within MEF, the three line ministries, and selected provincial \ndepartments and districts, detailing activities for the organizational development of \ninternal audit functions will be undertaken. Based on these background inputs, a road \nmap  detailing  a  wide  range  of  activities  will  be  prepared  to  assist  in  designing \nprograms that will contribute to strengthened PFM and organizational development of \ninternal audit functions. These efforts will also include consensus-building seminars. \n \n(ii)  Capacity development and training. A comprehensive training needs analysis (TNA) \nwill be undertaken to recommend corresponding capacity building measures in the \nthree line ministries, selected provincial departments and districts, and NAA. TNA \nrecommendations will build into a detailed training plan that will cover (a) training for \nrelevant PFM issues under platforms 1 and 2, with emphasis on budget planning, \nprogram budgeting and budget execution; (b) specialized training for organizational \nand behavioral improvements; (c) change management; and (d) internal audit. During \nthe design of the TA outcome, the training plan will be presented to a wide range of \nstakeholders through open seminars and workshops for defining the overall vision \nand implementation strategy of the SPFMRD. \n \n(iii)  Effectiveness of NAA and internal audit interface. The road map for institutional \nstrengthening of NAA, including the capacity for performance audit of social sector \nspending and rural development projects, will be prepared. The road map will build on \nNAA\u2019s Strategic Development Plan 2007\u20132011 and will include pilot audit of selected ", "  5\nprojects. The TA will initiate the preparatory work to determine the terms of reference \nand costs for building a network of internal audit institutions and NAA for an improved \ninterface between external audit and heads of internal audit departments. Thus the \ncoordination mechanism will be strengthened.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $560,000.00 equivalent. The amount of $475,000.00 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund (JSF), funded by the Government of \nJapan.  The Government\u2019s contribution to the TA will be in kind and will cover items of expenditure \nthat are estimated at $85,000 equivalent. Appendix 3 presents the cost estimates and financing plan. \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MEF will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MRD, MOWRAM, MAFF, and NAA will be the \nimplementing agencies. The ADB project team, in coordination with the Cambodia Resident Mission, \nwill coordinate implementation with all stakeholders, and development partners. In addition, the PFM \nReform Committee, chaired by the Secretary of State, MEF, who concurrently chairs the Public \nFinancial Management Technical Working Group, will function as the TA steering committee to \nprovide guidance and will monitor TA progress.8  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 9 months from December 2007 to August 2008, \nand will require three international consultants with skills in public financial management (6 person-\nmonths),  institutional  development  (3.5  person-months),  and  state  audit  and  internal  audit (3.5 \nperson-months).  In  addition,  three national  consultants in  the  field of  audit  (5  person-months), \nbudget (8 person-months), and capacity development (5 person-months) will provide support. Given \nthe variety of the skills and experiences required and the intermittent nature of the assignments, all \nthe consultants will be hired as individuals by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for the consultancy \nservices, as well as the reporting requirements relating to the TA output are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n16.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $475,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Cambodia for Preparing the Strengthening of Public Financial Management for Rural \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n8  Representatives from NAA and the Ministry of National Assembly-Senate Relation and Inspection (MONASRI) will be \ninvited to meetings of the PFM Reform Committee. \n ", "  6           Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nStrengthening public  Cambodia meets MDG target  National Institute of  There is macroeconomic \nfinancial management  no. 8, which calls for further  Statistics data   and political stability. \nas an enabling  development of an \u201copen,     \ncondition for poverty  rule-based, non- Analysis and studies by \nreduction   discriminatory trading and  the Cambodian \nfinancial system.\u201d  Development Research \n  Institute, Economic \nKey PFM performance  Institute of Cambodia  \nindicators are on a steady   \ncourse of improvement.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \nWith a low per capita income, Cambodia is one of the poorest countries of the world. Income poverty is \nhigh. Inequalities are deep-seated, the urban rural poverty divide is marked, and growth is non-inclusive. A \nWorld Bank Poverty Assessment in 2006 (Cambodia: Halving Poverty by 2015) cited the growing incidence \nof rural poverty despite a marked decline in the poverty level during the period 1994\u20132004. The study \nfurther showed that the prospect of growth in rural Cambodia, home to almost 91% of the poor and \nextremely deprived, is a challenge due to sluggish agricultural growth and lower labor productivity.  \n \nThis partly explains why Cambodia lags behind many developing countries on several human development \nindexes. It is ranked 129th out of 177 countries in the UN\u2019s Human Development Report (2006). The human \npoverty index that looks beyond income deprivation similarly ranks Cambodia 73rd among 102 developing \ncountries.  Cambodia faces daunting challenges in its efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), and may not be on track in many critical areas of food security, poverty reduction, and sustainable \nsocial and economic development.  \n \nTo enable Cambodia to meet its target under MDG 8, which calls for further development of an \u201copen, rule-\nbased, non-discriminatory trading and financial system,\u201d achieving progress in the crosscutting agenda of \npublic financial management (PFM) would support progress in the sector by enhancing the effectiveness of \npublic expenditures and improve sector efficiency and accountability. Robust PFM mechanisms will improve \nallocative efficiency and the investment climate. The impact of the project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA) on economic growth would be significant as good PFM practices promote pro-poor growth by directing \npublic expenditure spending to the rural development sector.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nAs suggested above, reform measures supported by this TA do not have a direct impact on poverty. No \ndirect social impacts are, therefore, expected from the project. On the other hand, indirect social impacts \nare significant, manifested in improvements in the quality and quantity of public services and improved \ngovernance due to more transparent and accountable management of public resources. No adverse impact \nrequiring mitigating measures was therefore identified. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nWhile formal stakeholder analysis or a participation strategy was not produced as discrete outputs, the TA \nwas conceptualized and formulated based on extensive formal and informal stakeholder consultations. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe envisaged TA design indicates that there will be no negative impact on women. The PFM outcome \nwould  promote  inclusive  growth,  and  would  identify  gender-responsive  policy  changes,  based  on \nassessment and feedback during the TA implementation process. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
