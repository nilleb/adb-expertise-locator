Consulting Services \n \n4.  The TA will require 11 person-months of international and 6 person months of national \nconsulting inputs. The scope of this  project is an extension of the  proposed Outer Island \nRenewable Energy Project, therefore single source selection of the same consultancy firm (High \nChem GmbH) is proposed. This fact will allow the natural continuity in the technical approach, \nhighly  qualified  work,  retaining  experience  acquired,  continued  professional  liability,  and \ncontinuation of good performance. The firm was previously engaged through quality- and cost-\nbased selection method (quality-cost ratio of 90:10), due to the specific technological complexity \nof the previous project preparation using a simplified technical proposal in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2010, as amended from time to time). The proceeds \nof the PPTA will be disbursed in line with ADB\u201fs Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(April 2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n5.  The cluster TA, ADB\u201fs Pilot Asia Pacific Climate Technology Finance Center, Subproject \nB, Assessment of Technology options for priority projects, will finance as in-kind contribution 3 \nperson months of international consulting inputs.
