INTRODUCTION \n1.  A project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for rural electrification was included for \n2007 in the country strategy and program 2006\u20132010 for Bhutan.1 On 12 July 2006, the \nGovernment of Bhutan confirmed that it would give priority to the TA and requested the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  include  additional  TA  components  for  transmission  and \nhydropower development. Based on the clearance of the TA concept paper,2 the ADB Fact-\nFinding Mission went to Bhutan on 5\u201319 October 2006 for field visits and discussions with the \nGovernment, the Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC), and other agencies. The mission and the \nGovernment reached an understanding on the rationale, objectives, scope, implementation \narrangements, terms of reference, and cost estimates of the TA.3  \n \n2.  The TA aims to help the Government (i) expand rural electrification, (ii) integrate an \ninterregional national transmission system, and (iii) accelerate hydropower development. The \nTA is expected to prepare the loan project to achieve these three objectives in 2008. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Water is the most productive natural resource in Bhutan. The mountainous terrain and \nthe network of perennially flowing rivers and streams provide an abundant source of clean and \nrenewable energy. Bhutan has 26 hydropower stations that consist of 4 major hydroelectric \npower plants,4 12 mini-hydro plants, and 10 microhydro plants, with a total installed capacity of \nabout 468 megawatts (MW). Because the country\u2019s electricity generation is significantly greater \nthan the maximum domestic demand of 130 MW, Bhutan is a net power exporter. \n \n4.  Of total power generated, 70% is exported to India. Power exports account for the \nlargest source of Government revenue in the form of taxes and dividends from hydropower \ncompanies. Given the production of an additional 1,020 MW from the Tala hydropower project \ncommissioned  in  July  2006,  the  power  sector  is  expected  to  account  for  over  60%  of \nGovernment revenue after 2007.  \n \n5.  Despite  the  nation\u2019s  net  power  surplus,  most  people  do  not  yet  have  access  to \nelectricity.5 The Government aims for 100% electrification by 2020 as outlined in the Vision \n2020,  Electricity  for  All.  The  Rural  Electrification  Master  Plan  targets  increasing  the \nelectrification ratio to 52.0% under the 9th Five-Year Plan and to 85.6% under the 10th Five-\nYear Plan (2008\u20132013). Rural electrification has substantial benefits because (i) electricity is \ncheaper than kerosene for lighting, (ii) it is environment-friendly, and (iii) it has none of the \nhealth  hazards  associated  with  alternative  fuel  sources  such  as  kerosene  or  wood.  Rural \nelectrification also makes social interventions to the poor since it helps diversify income-earning \nactivities: electrically operated rice mills and flour mills increase supplementary income and jobs, \nand small business establishments sprout where electricity is available. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Bhutan: Country Strategy and Program 2006\u20132010. Manila. \n2  The concept paper for the TA was approved on 21 July 2006. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 6 November 2006. \n4  (i) Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation (336 MW, funded by India); (ii) Basochhu Hydro Power Corporation (64 MW, \nfunded by Austria); (iii) Tala Hydroelectric Project Authority (1,020 MW, funded by India) in the western region; and \n(iv) Kurichhu Hydro Power Corporation (60 MW, funded by India) in the eastern region. The Tala power plant will \nbe fully owned by the Government within 2 years. The other three companies are wholly Government-owned. \n5  The Special Assistance for Project Formation provided by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) in \n2006 determined that 36% of the population had access to electricity as of 2005.  \n ", "2   \n6.  ADB has helped Bhutan expand rural electrification through three consecutive loans \nsince 1995, covering over 19,250 households. The third loan6 is ongoing and expected to be \ncompleted before the original closing date of 31 March 2007. During the 10th Five-Year Plan, \nthe Government aims for the electrification of 24,358 more rural households. Of these, the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) plans to finance 15,424 in 10 districts. To cover \nthe balance of 8,934, the Government has requested ADB\u2019s continuous assistance for \u201crural \nelectrification IV\u201d in eight districts,7 including remote central and eastern regions.  \n \n7.  The electrification of the central and eastern regions requires connecting two national \ngrid systems (Dhajay to Gelephu) in the western and eastern regions.8 In the central and \neastern regions, power supply comes from only one major generation station, in Kurichhu (60 \nMW). In the winter, the regions are supposed to import power through the grid extended to India \nto meet significant load growth caused by energy-intensive industries,9 but they cannot because \nIndia itself suffers from a power shortage. Connecting the two grids will bring surplus power \nfrom three major hydropower stations in the western region to the central and eastern regions. \nThe interregional grid connection will thus (i) establish the integrated power transmission grid \nnetwork to increase the security and reliability of nationwide power supply; (ii) provide adequate \npower to domestic and industrial costumers in the eastern and central regions; and (iii) set up \nhigh-speed digital information links using optic fiber ground wires, which are common to power \nsupply and information and communication technology.  \n \n8.  For the past decades, ADB assistance has also focused on improving the power sector\u2019s \nefficiency. The Government has reformed the sector by unbundling the Department of Power, \nMinistry of Trade and Industry, into (i) the Department of Energy (DOE) as the Government\u2019s \npolicy and planning agency, (ii) the Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA) as the sector regulator, \nand (iii) the Bhutan Power Corporation as the transmission and distribution company. The \nGovernment and ADB see the second-generation reforms as focusing on improving the capacity \nand efficiency of hydropower generation. To optimize resources and maximize their efficiency, \nthe Druk Hydro Power Corporation (DHPC) is to be established in 2008 as a holding company \nto oversee the Government\u2019s interests in hydropower companies and projects.10 \n \n9.  In July 2006, the governments of Bhutan and India signed an umbrella agreement with a \nmutual obligation to develop and trade at least 5,000 MW hydropower generation by 2020. \nAccelerating the development of hydropower for its export will be of strategic significance to \nBhutan\u2019s economy. It will provide low-cost power to domestic and industrial customers, making \nthe  sector  environmentally,  economically,  and  financially  sustainable.  Because  the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  capacity  for  large  infrastructure  projects  is  limited,  the  hydropower \ndevelopment strategy will leverage public and private investments through private participation \nin development projects. Such an approach is expected to accelerate hydropower development, \nrestraining Government expenditures and generating income for socioeconomic development \nsuch as rural electrification. Given an export market in India with a critical power shortage, clean \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003.

Particle board, ferro-silicon, and calcium carbide are \nall for export to India, and Bhutan is major supplier of cement to Assam. Cheaper power from hydropower plants in \nBhutan will support cross-border trade with India and give industries a comparative advantage. \n10 ADB. 2003.

The TA completed the feasibility study to establish DHPC. \n ", "  3\nenergy  development  for  power  export  will  improve  energy  efficiency  and  foster  economic \ncooperation in South Asia.  \n \n10.  Theoretical potential hydropower in Bhutan is 30,000 MW, only about 5% of which is \nbeing used. Hydropower sites are mainly export-oriented and run-of-the-river types. The Power \nSector Master Plan has prioritized hydropower development projects. To accelerate them on a \nsustainable basis, the Government requests ADB\u2019s support to establish a policy and institutional \nframework for private participation such as public-private partnerships (PPPs) and independent \npower producers (IPPs).  \n \n11.  The Dagachhu hydropower development (114 MW), which aims to export power to India, \nis proposed as a demonstration project to be financed by leveraging public and private capital in \nline with a new policy for private participation in hydropower. It will be a run-of-the-river type with \nbarrages where water will be diverted to the powerhouse, and no major backwater will be \ncreated.  The  development  is  planned  to  be  implemented  under  the  clean  development \nmechanism as defined in the Kyoto Protocol.11 The Dagachhu project site has technical and \nphysical advantages: (i) it has moderate capacity that can be financed (with a relatively simple \nfinancing structure); (ii) it has a grid connection matching power evacuation closely;12 (iii) its \naccess roads are close to the project site; (iv) it has low sedimentation in the river, which is \ntechnically favorable; and (v) unlike reservoir types of projects, run-of-the river types have  small \nenvironmental and social impacts relative to the economic benefits. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project preparatory TA is designed to (i) expand the nationwide power supply and \nextend electricity to remote rural households, and (ii) enhance region-wide energy efficiency and \ncross-border  economic  cooperation.  These  impacts  will  be  achieved  by  preparing  and \nstrengthening comprehensive project design, feasibility assessment, and implementation plans \nfor three components: (i) rural electrification IV, (ii) interregional transmission links, and (iii) \nDagachhu hydropower development. To help the Government promote private participation in \nhydropower development, the TA will also develop a policy and institutional framework. Each TA \ncomponent  will  be  assessed  to  be  technically,  economically,  and  financially  feasible,  and \nsocially and environmentally acceptable to the Government and ADB. The TA design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1, and the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix \n2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will have three parts: \n \n(i)  Component 1: Expansion of rural electrification. This will focus on preparing \nthe electrification of 8,934 households in eight districts. In collaboration with BPC \nstaff, the study will survey line routes and update technical feasibility studies, \nincluding the detailed project design, cost estimates, schedule, and procurement \npackages. Tariff pricing will be analyzed along with cost recovery and cross-\n                                                 \n11 The Government of Austria supported the feasibility study and preparation of the project design document \nsubmitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  \n12 An additional transmission line (19 km) to evacuate power generation must be connected to the Dhajay substation. \n ", "4   \nsubsidy  among  customer  categories  and  in  the  entire  sector\u2019s  value  chain \nprocess. Since BEA aims to finalize key regulations on renewable energy, tariffs, \nand licenses within 2006, policy and regulatory impacts on rural electrification will \nalso be assessed.  \n \n(ii)  Component 2: Integration of the interregional national transmission system. \nThe missing links to be connected will be about 45 km: 30 km of 220 kilovolts (kV) \nand 15 km of 132 kV with three interconnecting substations between Dhajay \n(Tsirang) to Gelephu. The TA will review the technical requirements and cost \nestimates and formulate the project schedule and procurement packages. The \nadequacy  of  the  overall  grid  network  system  will  be  assessed  for  future \nexpansion.  \n \n(iii)  Component 3: Acceleration of hydropower development. The scope of work \nincludes three overlapping phases: (a) the sector road map and institutional \nframework for the hydropower sector, (b) the policy framework of hydropower \ndevelopment and private participation, and (c) the preparation of a model project \nunder the policy. In the first phase, the TA will focus on improving the efficiency \nof the hydropower sector by helping the Government form DHPC. In line with the \nGood  Governance  Plus  (GG+)  Exercise  of  2005,13  the  TA  will  propose  an \ninstitutional framework to promote private participation. In the second phase, the \nTA  will  formulate  a  policy  and  regulatory  framework  to  promote  hydropower \ndevelopment and private participation in the form of PPPs and IPPs. Using a \nconsultative and learning approach in the third phase, the TA will prepare a \nfinancing plan for the Dagachhu hydropower development through PPPs, where \nthe public sector is proactive in financial structuring with private parties. The TA \nwill help the Government introduce a framework and arrangements for private \nparticipation  by  preparing  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  as  a \nshowcase.  \n \n14.  The TA will facilitate environment and social safeguard assessment and clearance in the \nproject areas. It will include financial and economic viability assessments for each component of \nthe ensuing loan project. Financing plans for each component will be assessed to ensure that \nthe  borrowing  will  be  financially  sustainable.  In  particular,  the  Dagachhu  hydropower \ndevelopment  will  need  suitable  financial  arrangements  (e.g.,  ownership  options,  financial \nstructuring, and modeling) to ensure the Government\u2019s debt sustainability. The TA will support \nthe communication process to prepare the optimal financing and/or guaranteeing scheme with \npublic and private investors and lenders, including bilateral and multilateral banks and/or export \ncredit agencies.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA\u2019s total cost is estimated at $1,910,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $1,600,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government of Bhutan will finance $310,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency  costs  through  in-kind  contributions,  including  office  accommodation  and  facilities, \ncounterpart staff, data, and other information. The detailed cost estimates and a financing plan \n                                                 \n13 As per the GG+, the Government has directed the power sector to focus on accelerating hydropower development \nand to draft a strategy paper and institutional action plans with indicators to achieve Vision 2020\u2019s targets.  \n ", "  5\nare in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that TA approval does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  DOE will be the Executing Agency for all TA components. BPC will be the Implementing \nAgency  for  components  1  and  2,  and  DOE,  including  a  special-purpose  vehicle  to  be \nestablished, will be the Implementing Agency for component 3. Before TA implementation, DOE \nwill  form  a  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  DOE,  with  senior \nrepresentatives from relevant ministries and agencies14 to promote project preparation and \npolicy  making.  The  planning  and  coordination  head  of  DOE  will  be  the  project  director, \noverseeing day-by-day TA implementation. DOE and BPC will establish the counterpart project \nteam and appoint its manager for each TA component to help the consultants liaise with other \ngovernment ministries and agencies, local authorities, and people in the project areas, and \nobtain data and documentation from them. DOE and BPC will provide sufficient office space, \nfurniture, and support facilities to the TA consultants on time.  \n \n17.  The TA will require 72 person-months of consulting services (40 international and 32 \nnational). The study will be implemented over 14 months, from March 2007 to April 2008. The \nareas  of  expertise  required  for  the  consultants  and  the  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in \nAppendix 4 and reporting requirements are in Appendix 1. A consulting firm or consortium of \nfirms will be engaged by ADB through its quality- and cost-based selection procedures in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its \nBorrowers,  and  the  TA-financed  equipment  will  be  procured  under  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  The  Government  requested  ADB  for  advance  contracting  to  facilitate  TA \nimplementation.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n18.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,600,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Bhutan for \npreparing the Bhutan Power Development Project.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n14 The steering committee will consist of DOE, BPC, Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation, the Department of Aid and \nDebt Management, the National Environment Commission, and the Department of Forests.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  /Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nExpand the nationwide power  Increase access to  Government  \u2022  Signing of the loan \nsupply system and extend  electricity for 8,934  statistical and  agreement for the ensuing \nelectricity to more rural  households in eight  survey reports  loan project between the \nhouseholds  districts, achieving a    Government and ADB \n  cumulative national  Annual reports and   \n  electrification ratio of  project progress  \u2022  Signing of the loan \n  85.6% by 2013  reports of BPC and  agreement for a rural \n    hydropower  electrification project \n    companies  between the Government \nEnhance region-wide energy  Increase cross-   and JBIC \nefficiency and economic  border power trade     \ncooperation  between Bhutan and  \u2022  The Government gives high \n  India with an  priority to rural electrification \nadditional 5,000 MW  and hydropower for power \nelectricity by 2020  export \n \n\u2022  Sustainable debt services of \nthe Government (the \nborrower) \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nComponent 1:   MOU to process the  MOU signed by the  \u2022  The Government gives high \nRural electrification.  ensuing loan in 2008  Government and  priority to the ensuing loan \nAll subproject plans to extend    ADB  project and policy prepared \nelectricity to target  Environment and    by the TA \nhouseholds in eight districts,  social clearance by  NEC\u2019s clearance   \nacceptable economically,  NEC in 2007 and in  letters  \u2022  Funding supported by the \nenvironmentally, and socially  compliance with ADB  Endorsements of  Government and \nto ADB and the Government  guidelines  ADB loan  cofinanciers \n    processing    \nComponent 2:      \nTransmission links.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bhutan: \n \nMost people (about 85%) live in rural areas. Rural electrification is therefore key in the Government\u2019s development \nstrategy. The Government is highly committed to develop and promote rural electrification projects, which are \nexpected to benefit many. The target is to bring electricity to the entire population, rural and urban, by 2020. Under the \npresent Five Year Plan of the Government, about 15,000 households are expected to be electrified, raising the \nproportion of people with electricity to 52%.  \n \nAccess to electricity in rural areas is key to human development as well as economic growth. Electrification does not \nonly mean longer productive hours. It is also expected to improve health care delivery and education. Most of all, it will \ngive rural people a greater range of opportunities to improve their lives and earning capacity. It will especially improve \nthe lives of women and children, reducing the incidence of respiratory diseases and increasing their time for more \nproductive activities. \n \nAnother immediate tangible benefit of electrification is the reduction of the use of kerosene and wood, which are \ncostly. Electricity will also be brought to rural health centers, schools, and other public facilities.  \n \nRural electrification and interregional transmission links will provide a stable supply of such electricity as well as \nopportunities for commercial business and jobs in many rural areas. Benefits from power export, owing to capacity \nincreased by the new run-of-the-river generation plant in Dagachhu, will contribute to the country\u2019s economic growth, \nproviding low-cost electricity to the customers including to the most vulnerable households of the poor. Regional \ndevelopment and use of clean and renewable energy will specifically benefit the poor since they are the most harmed \nby pollution and environmental degradation. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA socioeconomic survey will provide the basis for a social impact assessment, which will include analyses of \nresettlement issues and impacts on indigenous people.  \n \nThe impact of delivering electricity must be evaluated not only on the basis of the beneficiaries\u2019 ongoing activities but \nalso of the opportunities that are likely to open. A poverty analysis will be prepared during the TA to better understand \nthe impacts of the ensuing loan project of the final users, particularly the poor.  \n \nA benefit distribution analysis of the loan project will be performed using the results of the poverty analysis. The \nnumber of poor and vulnerable (based on the national poverty line and food sufficiency) will be calculated and benefits \nfrom new electricity connections estimated based on willingness-to-pay data from the socioeconomic survey and data \nshowing current electrification rates. \n \n \nC.
