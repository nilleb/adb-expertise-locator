INTRODUCTION \n1.  Central Asia\u2019s strategic location as a land bridge that connects the Caucasus, Europe, \nthe  Russian  Federation,  the  Middle  East,  East  Asia,  and  South  Asia  offers  tremendous \nopportunities for transport and trade links with the burgeoning economies in these regions. In \n2007,  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Transport  and  Trade \nFacilitation Strategy (the original strategy) was endorsed. In 2012\u20132013, a midterm review took \nstock of the original strategy and led to a refined Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020 \n(TTFS 2020), which was endorsed at the 12th Ministerial Conference on 23\u201324 October 2013 in \nKazakhstan. TTFS 2020 acknowledges the importance of knowledge services and partnerships \nas necessary levers to propel TTFS 2020 implementation. Knowledge solutions are also one of \nthe strategic priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) leading up to 2020.1 \n2.  Given the emphasis on knowledge provision, management, and partnerships in ADB\u2019s \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020 and TTFS 2020, a concept note and work plan on provision of \nknowledge sharing and services for TTFS 2020 was endorsed by CAREC countries at the 13th \nTransport Sector Coordination Committee (TSCC) Meeting in Bishkek on 14\u201315 May 2014, and \nthe Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting in Manila on 26\u201327 June 2014. Based on this, the proposed \nregional technical assistance (TA) for knowledge sharing and services (KSS) is designed as a \nvehicle for generation, management, and dissemination of knowledge aimed at strengthening \nTTFS 2020 implementation in the areas of transport and transport facilitation.2 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Compared  with  the  original  strategy,  TTFS  2020  places  a  greater  emphasis  on \nmultimodal corridor network development, trade and border-crossing service improvements, and \nimprovements to sustainability and quality of service. Against this backdrop, the proposed TA \nwill address the following key constraints to effective and timely TTFS 2020 implementation: \n \n4.  Incomplete alignment between national policies, plans, and programs and TTFS \n2020  operational  priorities.  Reflecting  the  focus  of  the  original  strategy,  transport  sector \ninvestments and programming in several CAREC countries have focused on building roads (and \nto  some  extent,  railways),  and  not  given  adequate  consideration  to  improving  nodal \ninfrastructure  (e.g.,  border  crossing  points  (BCPs)  and  logistics  facilities),  institutions,  and \nservices. In particular, CAREC countries need policy advisory support to assess and bridge the \nfollowing gaps in their national policies and practices: \n \n(i)  Limited multimodal connectivity and integration. Given the competition for \ntransit trade between CAREC and other east-west transport corridors, CAREC \ncorridors require (a) seamless connectivity with seaports; (b) long-haul block train \noperations; and (c) intermodal hubs and logistics services, to stay competitive. \nPhysical infrastructure development is ongoing, but more attention needs to be \npaid  to  integrated  multimodal  corridor  planning  and  management;  and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n2  Transport facilitation is a part of trade facilitation and may be defined as the simplification and harmonization of \ninternational transport procedures to facilitate cross-border movement of vehicles and cargo. Hence, transport \nfacilitation focuses on issues of market access (traffic rights, vehicle permits, and quotas); technical standards for \nroad design; vehicle insurance; driver visa and licenses; standards for vehicle weight, size, dimensions, and \ncarriage conditions; customs guarantee for trucks and cargo; and cargo and transport documentation. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 October 2014. The TA concept \nwas approved by the vice-president (Operations 1) on 12 September 2014. \n ", "2  \ninstitutional arrangements to ensure uninterrupted services and interoperability \nfor quickly moving bulk cargo via CAREC corridors. \n(ii)  Bottlenecks at BCPs. Despite improvements to the physical infrastructure, trade \nfacilitation  indicators  have  not  improved  as  much.  More  work  is  needed  to \nunderstand inefficiencies at BCPs related to physical throughput capacity; import, \nexport, and transit processes; and coordination between border agencies. \n(iii)  Inefficient cross-border movement of vehicles. While there are a number of \ntransport facilitation agreements in place, cross-border movement of vehicles \nremains constrained. This indicates the need for further diagnostics and practical \nrecommendations related to the incomplete standardization of road technical \nstandards, vehicle weights and dimensions; and incomplete mutual recognition of \ntraffic rights, driving licenses, insurance cover, and vehicle registration. \n(iv)  Inadequate asset management. Most CAREC countries face challenges with \nroad  maintenance.  Improvements  are  needed  in  prioritizing,  selecting,  and \nscheduling maintenance works; ensuring adequate financing; and implementing \nan  effective  approach  to  executing  maintenance  works,  e.g.,  public\u2013private \npartnerships and/or performance-based contracting. \n(v)  Risks to environmental sustainability. An aged vehicle fleet and growing traffic \non CAREC corridors pose higher environmental risks, indicating the need for new \nenvironment-friendly approaches to designing and operating transport systems. \n(vi)  Project  delays.  In  2013,  40%  of  projects  under  the  original  strategy  were \noverdue. Timely delivery of TTFS 2020 requires improving national capacities in \nprocurement and contract management of externally financed projects. \n \n5.  Inadequate country capabilities to deliver on new TTFS 2020 operational priorities. \nMany CAREC countries are showing growing interest in reorienting their policy and programs to \nclose the aforementioned gaps, which have also been identified as operational priorities in the \nTTFS 2020.4 But despite their interest, these CAREC countries struggle to effectively deliver on \nthese priorities because they have inadequate know-how and capabilities (policy, regulatory, \ninstitutional, and human resources) to plan and implement appropriate policies and programs in \nthese  areas.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  a  wealth  of  experience  in  other  countries  in \nimplementing policies and programs in these areas, which CAREC countries can benefit from. \n \n6.  Weak knowledge management. To date, a number of knowledge services have been \nprovided to CAREC countries, such as seminars, training, or TA by ADB and development \npartners. However, this knowledge service provision has largely been one-off and silo-based, \nfollow-up and operational links have been limited, and organization and management of these \nknowledge  resources  is  poor,  thereby  constraining  the  effectiveness  of  these  knowledge \nservices. A knowledge management function is needed to solicit good practices, index and \ncatalog information, and serve as an information broker to facilitate knowledge exchange among \nCAREC countries, and between CAREC and other regional cooperation initiatives. \n \n7.  Insufficient  data  availability  and  results  monitoring.  The  availability  of  reliable, \ncomplete, and/or harmonized data on CAREC corridors (e.g., physical progress of TTFS 2020 \nprojects,  road  conditions,  safety,  and  traffic  flows)  is  limited.  This  impacts  the  effective \nmonitoring and evaluation of project outcomes and corridor performance. \n \n                                                 \n4  In 2014, CAREC governments requested ADB for a scoping study on trans-Caspian links and policy advice on the \nformation of the Pakistan Land Port Authority. ADB has also received requests for participation of CAREC \ngovernment officials in trainings on logistics and green freight. \n ", "  3\n8.  The TA incorporates lessons and builds on the achievements and recommendations \nfrom prior ADB TAs. For example, the TA will operationalize recommendations to carry out \nfurther policy advisory work that emerged out of the ADB TA on CAREC cross-border transport.5 \nThe TA will also take forward the work that has begun on design of a geographic information \nsystem (GIS) database under the TA on formulation of CAREC TTFS 2020.6 Furthermore, the \nTA will seek to emulate successful partnership models tested under other ADB TAs on trade \nfacilitation in CAREC. Examples include twinning arrangements between CAREC countries that \nhave acceded to the Revised Kyoto Convention and those that have not, and partnership with \nShanghai Customs College to implement a progressive training program for customs officials.7 \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be enhanced quality of TTFS 2020 implementation. The outcome will be \nenhanced capacities of CAREC countries for effective TTFS 2020 implementation in the areas \nof transport and transport facilitation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA comprises four key outputs to achieve the TA outcome: \n \n11.  Output  1:  Policy  advisory  and  analytical  work  on  selected  TTFS  2020  topics \nconducted. This entails (i) carrying out a demand assessment, consultations with CAREC \nstakeholders, and hands-on support to CAREC governments to identify, elaborate, and finalize \n(a) a detailed TA work program for endorsement by the TSCC; and (b) the scope of individual \npolicy advisory and analytical work to be done, including timeline, deliverables, and resource \nrequirements; (ii) producing at least 12 policy advisory and analytical products in the form of \n(a) sector, policy, and issues-oriented studies\u2014e.g., diagnostics, prefeasibility and/or scoping \nstudies,  policy  recommendations,  and  assessments  of  sector  issues  and  practices;  and \n(b) operational tools\u2014e.g., good practice notes, how-to guidance and tip sheets, case studies, \nsample  terms  of  reference,  and  standardized  tools  and  instruments;  and  (iii) formalizing  a \nmemorandum of understanding with at least one research organization to foster knowledge \nadvisory support for CAREC governments at an institutional level.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Organization of knowledge on selected TTFS 2020 topics improved. This \nentails (i) undertaking a systematic review of literature on at least two TTFS 2020 topics to \ndevelop an indexed database of past knowledge resources, and uploading the database on the \nKSS web page; (ii) compiling an annotated bibliography on at least two TTFS 2020 topics; (iii) \ndeveloping and operationalizing coordination mechanisms to collect and consolidate data on \nphysical progress of CAREC TTFS 2020 projects and other corridor attributes, including safety, \npavement conditions, and traffic flows; and (iv) enhancing and updating the GIS database, as \nwell as integrating it with the corridor performance monitoring and measurement database. \n \n13.  Output 3: Sharing of knowledge and experiences on selected TTFS 2020 topics \nenhanced. This entails (i) launching a KSS web page on the CAREC Program website,  and \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2012.

Manila.  \n ", "4  \n(ii) conducting at least six experience-sharing seminars with no less than 120 participants. The \nseminars  will  emphasize  knowledge  exchange  not  only  among  CAREC  countries  but  also \nbetween CAREC and other regional cooperation initiatives in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.  \n \n14.  Output 4: Skills and know-how for applying knowledge on selected TTFS 2020 \ntopics in operational work strengthened. This entails (i) conducting at least three training \nworkshops (including one training of trainers workshop) with no less than 60 participants, to be \npreceded by a training needs assessment and gap analysis for various tiers of officials in the \npublic and private sector; and (ii) conducting at least one clinic to provide direct mentoring and \ncoaching to no less than 20 people on project design and implementation issues. \n \n15.  The assumptions are that (i) physical, human, and financial resources to implement \nTTFS 2020 are available; (ii) CAREC countries are willing to take advantage of the knowledge \nproducts and services in planning and implementing relevant policies and projects; and (iii) \ntimely inputs and consensus from multiple internal and external stakeholders are mobilized. The \nrisks are that (i) external factors adversely impact TTFS 2020 implementation; (ii) government \nofficials  who  underwent  training  might  be  transferred;  and  (iii)  available  funding  might  be \ninsufficient to keep up with demand for policy advisory inputs from CAREC countries. \n \n16.  Focus areas. The focus areas for the TA are based on TTFS 2020 operational priorities \nin  transport  and  transport  facilitation,  with  an  emphasis  on  those  topics  in  which  CAREC \ncountries have limited experience (para. 4), and where policy advisory inputs and knowledge \nsupport will add the most value. Hence, the TTFS 2020 topics for the key outputs will derive \nfrom  the  following:  (i) multimodal  connectivity,  including  logistics  hubs  and  maritime  links;  \n(ii)  designated  rail  corridor  services;  (iii)  coordinated  border  management;  (iv)  transport \nfacilitation; (v) public\u2013private partnerships; (vi) asset management, including user charges and \ncost recovery; (vii) green freight and logistics; and (viii) project management. To maintain the \nregional focus of the TA, the following \u201cregionality\u201d criteria will be applied to the design of TA \nactivities: (i) the study topics must have a regional dimension, i.e., the topic being studied must \naffect, or be targeted at, two or more CAREC countries; and (ii) all training workshops and \nseminars must involve participation of at least two or more CAREC countries. \n \n17.  Operational  links.  TA  outputs  are  expected  to  feed  into  operations  through \n(i) standardized guidelines, templates, tools, and instruments for use by project teams and \nconsultants at preparation and implementation stages; (ii) hands-on training and project clinics \nthat emphasize practical skills development; (iii) policy, sector, and issues-oriented studies to \nguide  development  of  a  TA  pipeline  and  identification  of  \u201csoft\u201d  project  components,  to  be \nexamined more in-depth in the feasibility stage; and (iv) staff who are part of the TA team will \nact as \u201cchampions\u201d by introducing new ideas and tools to their other projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,800,000, of which $1,400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V), and $400,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund and administered by ADB.  The cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency for this project. The Transport and Communications \nDivision (CWTC) in ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) will administer the TA. A \n ", "  5\nteam  comprising  at  least  three  international  staff  members,  one  national  officer,  and  one \noperations assistant will oversee the implementation of the TA. \n \n20.  TA implementation emphasizes intra- and inter-agency coordination. Hence, the TA will \ncoordinate with other ADB TAs in CAREC\u2014e.g., the proposed TA on road safety and the \nongoing TA on private sector participation, to enhance outreach, maximize benefits, and save \non costs.8 In addition, the TA will tap ADB staff in the transport community of practice to serve \nas resource persons. CWTC will also collaborate with development partners, and other regional \ncooperation initiatives and knowledge-sharing platforms to organize joint knowledge events. \n \n21.  Implementation of the TA will take 4 years, from January 2015 to December 2018. \nDisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  TA  activities  require  132 \nperson-months  of  consultant  services,  including  sector  specialists  and  resource  persons \n(international, 31 person-months; national, 15 person-months), regional cooperation specialists \n(international, 8 person-months, intermittent), research officers (national, 42 person-months), \ncoordination officers (national, 30 person-months, intermittent), and a GIS specialist (national, 6 \nperson-months, intermittent). Given the diversity of topics, the independent nature of most \nindividual assignments, and their short duration, consultants will be recruited individually in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Other activities to be \nfinanced by the TA include study tours, seminars, and workshops. \n \n22.  Since the precise scope of studies is defined during implementation, flexibility will be \nmaintained in the engagement of related sector specialists. Once the scope of the studies is \nwell  defined  and  agreed  with  the  CAREC  government(s),  detailed  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants will be prepared. Where appropriate, lump-sum or output-based contracts will be \nconsidered for these services. Based on the terms, where there is need for the services of a firm, \nit will be coordinated with ADB\u2019s Operations Services and Financial Management Department.  \n  \n23.  A TA progress report will be prepared annually for presentation and endorsement by the \nTSCC.  In  addition,  surveys  of  participants  (conducted  after  training  and  seminars)  will  be \nconducted. An assessment (including a tracer survey) will also be undertaken close to the end \nof TA implementation to evaluate more holistically the outcomes and lessons of the TA. \n \n24.  All TA outputs will be made available on the KSS web page, which will be added to the \nexisting CAREC Program website. Maintenance of the GIS database and the KSS web page \nwill be handed over to the CAREC Institute once it is fully functional. Guidelines and protocols \nwill be developed to assist CAREC Institute staff in maintenance activities before the migration. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,400,000 \non a grant basis for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation: Knowledge Sharing and \nServices in Transport and Transport Facilitation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2014.
