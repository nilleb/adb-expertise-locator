THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to India for the Supporting National Urban Health Mission program, and (ii) the proposed \nadministration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Strengthening Capacity of the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM).1 \n \n2.  The program will support the Government of India to implement the NUHM, which aims \nto improve the health status of the urban population, particularly of the poor and vulnerable, by \nfacilitating equitable access to quality health services.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  India has made good progress in achieving health outcomes over the last decades, \nespecially  in  the  rural  areas,  but  the  urban  poor  have  generally  not  benefitted.  India  is \nurbanizing rapidly, and the urban poor, estimated to number around 77.5 million, are one of the \ncountry\u2019s fastest-growing and most vulnerable population segments. They face harsh living \nconditions and have limited access to basic health care, resulting in a disproportionate burden \nof ill health.3 For example, the majority of urban poor women delivered their babies at home. \nAlmost 60% of urban poor children below 1 year of age missed total immunization compared to \nthe urban average of 42.4%. The under-five mortality rate among urban poor was 72.7 per \n1,000 live births compared to the urban average of 51.9. Many are also migrant workers with \ninformal status, which limits their access to basic public services and welfare programs.   \n \n4.  The delivery of health services in urban areas is sub-optimal and fragmented. Past \ninterventions have tended to be in the form of vertical programs focusing on particular diseases, \nrather than investments made to strengthen broader urban health systems. Urban primary \nhealth facilities are limited in number with weak referral linkages, underutilized, vary in norms \nand quality, and have limited scope of services, such as in community outreach and health \npromotion. Most of the curative primary care occurs at secondary and tertiary levels, leading to \ninefficiencies and overcrowding of these centers. Financial protection and prevention of further \nimpoverishment of the poor is a key concern, given that a major part of total health expenditures \nis paid out-of-pocket to private providers.  \n \n5.  Private health providers dominate in urban areas. However, the large number of urban \npoor cannot afford these services, and the private health sector\u2019s contribution to primary health \ncare has been limited. Regulatory mechanisms and management capacity need to be improved \nto strengthen the enabling environment for private sector engagement in the health sector. \nMoreover, health in the urban context is affected by multiple physical and social environmental \nfactors and access to health services. For example, diarrhea\u2014a leading cause of death among \nchildren  in  India\u2014is  correlated  with  poor  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  practices.  More \nattention is therefore required to promote integrated urban planning and convergence across \nkey sectors that affect urban health. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided a program preparatory TA.

As a policy response, in May 2013, the Government of India launched the NUHM to \nstrengthen health service delivery in urban areas. The NUHM builds on extensive stakeholder \nconsultations and the successful experience of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), \nwhich started in 2005. The NUHM and the NRHM are sub-missions of the National Health \nMission (NHM) under the Government\u2019s Twelfth Five\u2013Year Plan.4 As a core strategy, the NUHM \nwill enhance the public health system infrastructure by establishing a network of urban primary \nhealth centers (UPHCs) covering all cities with a population above 50,000. The UPHCs, linked \nwith community outreach and referral services, will expand the access of the urban population \nto health services and strengthen primary health care in urban areas. Given that urban health is \na new priority for the Government of India, the NUHM requires strong support at all levels to \ngain  critical  momentum  and  to  effectively  tackle  evolving  challenges  unique  to  the  urban \ncontext. In October 2014, the Government of India also introduced the Swachh Bharat Mission \n(Clean  India  Initiative)  to  provide  universal  access  to  sanitation  facilities  in  urban  areas. \nEnsuring coherence and convergence of the NUHM and Swachh Bharat Mission will be crucial \nto attain the desired health outcomes. Building on the health sector gains, the Government of \nIndia plans to progressively move towards universal health coverage (UHC) under the Twelfth \nFive\u2013Year Plan. Success of the NUHM will be critical to the UHC agenda in urban areas, as \nUPHCs are expected to facilitate referrals and insurance coverage for the urban poor.   \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n7.  The program is in line with the priorities of the India country partnership strategy, 2013\u2013\n2017, which seeks to reinforce India\u2019s efforts towards inclusive growth.5 The program is also \naligned with the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which includes an increased focus on health \nsector operations and moving towards UHC.6 The results-based lending modality is appropriate \nfor the program because the NUHM has (i) strong government interest and ownership; (ii) a \nwell-defined implementation framework; and (iii) reasonable systems in fiduciary management, \nsafeguards,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E).  The  results-based  approach  will  help \nimprove the NUHM\u2019s systems and institutional capacity further and reduce the transaction costs \nassociated  with  monitoring  and  coordinating  the  large  and  diverse  range  of  activities  and \nstakeholders.  \n \n8.  The program will build on Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s extensive experience in the \nurban sector and in providing public\u2013private partnership (PPP) advisory services in India.7 It has \nthe following key features and will add value by: (i) strengthening management, M&E, and \nimplementation  processes  through  significant  capacity  building;  (ii)  facilitating  convergence \nbetween health and urban sector interventions, emphasizing integrated city-level planning with \nactive involvement of urban local bodies (ULBs); (iii) developing partnerships and mechanisms \nto engage the private health sector, including not-for-profit entities; (iv) enhancing community \nparticipation to improve governance and delivery of health services; and (v) fostering learning \nand knowledge sharing, good practices, and innovations in urban health. \n \n                                                \n4  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013.

The NUHM aims to improve the health status of the urban poor by facilitating equitable \naccess to quality, essential health services. The program will reinforce the NUHM\u2019s efforts by \nprioritizing results and sequencing outputs and targets critical to achievement of the NUHM\u2019s \noutcome. More specifically, the program results emphasize quality assurance, reaching the poor \nand  the  vulnerable,  enhancing  private  sector  participation  and  intersectoral  convergence, \nknowledge and innovation, and improved management capacity and business processes.

Program Results \n \n10.  The program will support the NUHM\u2019s goal to improve the health status of the urban \npopulation, particularly the poor and the vulnerable, across India. The outcome will be increased \naccess to an equitable and quality urban health system, as evidenced by increased institutional \ndeliveries (disbursement-linked indicator [DLI] 1) and complete childhood immunization (DLI 2). \nIncreased institutional deliveries, with their quality assured, will help reduce deaths among \nmothers and newborns. Improved immunization coverage will also help avert infant and child \nmortality. These indicators were chosen as they reflect high levels of inequity between urban \npoor and non-poor. The outcome will be achieved through the following outputs, which focus on \nstrengthening key building blocks of the urban health system:  \n ", "4 \n11.  Output 1: Urban primary health care delivery system strengthened. The NUHM \naims to establish a system of urban primary health facilities covering cities and large towns. This \noutput will sharpen the focus of the NUHM\u2019s investments on the urban poor through support for \nmapping  of  slums  and  vulnerable  population  and  city-level  health  planning  with  active \ninvolvement of ULBs (DLI 3, Program Action Plan [PAP] 1.4 and 1.5). This will allow the NUHM \nto have greater synergy with other urban services for improving health outcomes, especially for \nthe urban poor. This output will also ensure that minimum requirements\u2014such as clinical staff, \nmedicine, equipment, and service package\u2014are met at the UPHCs (DLI 3). The NUHM aims to \nstrengthen community outreach services to extend community health awareness and demand \nfor  services  through  urban  accredited  social  health  activists  and  community  collectives \ncomprising local women (Mahila Arogya Samitis). This output will ensure timely recruitment and \nadequate training of urban accredited social health activists, and close monitoring of their \nfunctioning (DLI 4). It will also  study and undertake capacity building of community-based \ninstitutions such as Mahila Arogya Samitis (PAP 1.2).  \n \n12.  Output 2: Quality of urban health services improved. The NUHM will introduce a \nquality assurance mechanism for urban primary health facilities in a phased manner. This output \nwill ensure that (i) state-level organizational arrangements for quality assurance and capacity to \nmanage the quality  assurance  system  are  established,  (ii) quality  measurements  including \nclient-satisfaction  are  developed,  and  (iii)  the NUHM  monitors the  progress  and  evaluates \neffectiveness of the quality assurance mechanism to guide states in making further quality \nimprovements  (DLI  5  and  PAP  1.7).  The  output  will  also  review  existing  private  provider \nregulations, accreditation practices, and incentives for improving quality, accountability, and \nreliability of services to promote an enabling environment for private sector engagement in \nhealth (PAP 1.3 and 1.6).  \n \n13.  Output  3:  Capacity  for  planning, management,  and innovation  and  knowledge \nsharing strengthened. The NUHM needs significant capacity building in program management \nand technical aspects of urban health to operationalize the NUHM\u2019s implementation framework \neffectively. This output will enhance staff capacity to implement the NUHM (DLI 6). It will help \nthe NUHM develop and implement a capacity development framework to plan, monitor, and \nprovide incentives for capacity development in urban health (DLI 6).8 States with weak capacity \nwill receive priority for capacity development support. Existing M&E mechanisms and staff \ncapacity will be enhanced to better support NUHM operations, monitor progress, and provide \nfeedback to policy and planning. More specifically, the output will (i) improve the existing health \nmanagement  information  system  (MIS)  to  produce  urban  disaggregated  data  (DLI  6);  (ii) \nstrengthen existing MIS to monitor the NUHM\u2019s progress; and (iii) improve data on key health \noutcome indicators (PAP 1.1 and PAP 5). This output will also assist the Ministry of Health and \nFamily  Welfare  (MOHFW)  to  develop  and  implement  a  framework  for  innovations  and \npartnerships (DLI 7). The framework will systematically capture local innovations and lessons, \nadapt international best practices, promote cross learning for replication and expansion, and \nprovide incentives for more innovative approaches and partnerships.   \n \n                                                \n8  The capacity development framework will include (i) a comprehensive human resource development plan for \nmanagerial and technical personnel; (ii) strengthening of existing national and state entities to support urban \nhealth; (iii) provision of technical and management support to MOHFW and states\u2014especially lagging ones, \nthrough a pool of experts and demand-based consulting inputs through an indefinite service delivery contract; and \n(iv) enhancing knowledge, training, and institutional capacity in urban health through organization of international \nand national forums, twinning arrangements between schools of public health in India and abroad, and a new \ndedicated institute for urban health research and training. \n ", "5 \n14.  Convergence and public\u2013private partnership. The program will promote convergence \nand PPPs across the three outputs. Convergence will be strengthened at three levels: (i) policy \nand planning at the state level, where state health societies include representatives from health \nand urban departments; (ii) integrated planning for urban health at the city level, with active \ninvolvement of ULBs, including in planning and mapping of slums and vulnerable populations; \nand (iii) community processes and participation for better urban services (e.g., water, sanitation, \nand  health  services)  and  improved  health  and  hygiene  practices.  The  program  will  also \nstrengthen  the  enabling  environment  and  capacity  for  private  sector  engagement  by  (i) \nconducting a detailed assessment of the experience, challenges, and opportunities for PPPs in \nIndia\u2019s health sector; and (ii) developing policy guidelines and a menu of models and options for \nPPPs in urban health, including with the nonprofit sector.  \n \n15.

A rigorous verification protocol, including independent, third-party validation, has been \nestablished.  Verification  of  outcome  DLIs  will  rely  on  the  Health  Management  Information \nSystem, validated by independent consultants for data quality and triangulated with population-\nbased survey data to verify overall trends. Output DLIs will be verified through (i) joint reviews \nby MOHFW and ADB after reports from the states are received to gain better insights from \nimplementation of program activities at the state level, and (ii) the use of existing reporting \nmechanisms, such as NUHM quarterly progress reports, and comparing the information with \nexpenditure reports. Independent evaluation of effectiveness and progress in quality assurance \nand implementation of the capacity development framework will be used for DLI verification, as \nwell as target setting for subsequent years. The verification process is designed to strengthen \nMOHFW\u2019s  capacity  in  overseeing  and  supporting  the  state-level  implementation  of  NUHM \nactivities.  \n \nE.

Disbursement arrangements. The loan will be disbursed over 3 years, subject to the \nachievement and verification of the DLIs. An initial disbursement of up to $40 million will take \nplace after loan effectiveness and upon verification of achievement of prior results (completed \nwithin 12 months prior to loan effectiveness). These prior results include: (i) state-level NUHM \nprogram implementation plans approved in FY2014; (ii) urban-specific guidelines for community \nhealth workers and quality assurance; and (iii) increased staffing in program management for \nstates, districts, and cities. All prior results have been met as of March 2015. Subsequent \ndisbursements will be made annually after the corresponding DLIs are met. ADB will field \nperiodic review missions, whose tasks will include validating DLI achievements prior to the \nsubmission of withdrawal applications. Once DLI achievements are validated, MOHFW will \nsubmit withdrawal applications, together with the DLI achievement report to ADB. Any amount \nnot disbursed for unmet DLIs will be disbursed once the DLIs are achieved. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the government\u2019s consolidated fund.  \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n20.  The program will strengthen capacity of NUHM institutions at various levels. The NUHM \nhas adopted NRHM\u2019s implementation arrangements, which have been tested and refined over \ntime, but urban-specific challenges require dedicated capacity-strengthening efforts, including: \n ", "7 \n(i)  strengthening  existing  technical  agencies  at  the  national  and  state  levels,  (ii)  technical \nsupport  to  states  through  a  pool  of  experts  located  at  the  central  level,  (iii)  establishing \ndedicated institutes for urban health research and training, and (iv) creating knowledge-sharing \nplatforms. The PAP complements the DLIs and includes actions in specific technical areas, \nfiduciary management, M&E, safeguards, and gender and social equity. The PAP focuses \ncapacity  building  on key  areas  of  identified gaps  pertaining to  strengthening  systems  and \ninstitutions at the national level, which in turn will strengthen the capacity of the states to \nimplement the NUHM.   \n \nG.  Technical Assistance \n \n21.  The attached capacity development TA will help strengthen NUHM implementation. The \nTA is estimated to cost $2.2 million, of which $2 million will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction.  The  government  will  support  the  TA  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, office and meeting space, and coordination support. The TA will support (i) \nstate-level  institutional  capacity  assessments;  (ii)  monitoring,  verification,  and  reporting  of \nprogram results; and (iii) developing and learning from innovations in urban health. The TA \nactivities will focus on states with weaker capacity and where ADB\u2019s urban sector presence can \nbe leveraged to enhance synergy and convergence. The TA will be implemented over a period \nof 36 months from July 2015.  \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  Program implementation will follow the NUHM Implementation Framework. MOHFW will \nbe  the  executing  agency.  The  NHM  Steering Group  under the  Union  Health  Minister,  the \nEmpowered Program Committee under the Secretary of MOHFW, and the National Program \nCoordination  Committee  under  the  Mission  Director  will  guide  and  oversee  NUHM \nimplementation,  including  the  program.  The  Urban  Health  Division  of  MOHFW  will  be  the \nimplementing agency, coordinating program activities, and supporting state-level activities. The \nstates  will  implement  NUHM  activities  based  on  the  annually  approved  state  program \nimplementation plans. The states will prepare periodic reports on progress in meeting DLIs and \nPAP  as  part  of  their  regular  reporting  on  overall  NUHM  implementation.  MOHFW  will \nconsolidate state-level reports and submit periodic progress reports on achievement of DLIs and \nPAP and other NUHM key performance indicators, and prepare DLI achievement reports for \ndisbursement. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n23.  The program\u2019s soundness was assessed according to its relevance, justification, and \nadequacy. 9  The  program  is  highly  relevant  to  India\u2019s  sustainable  and  inclusive  urban \ndevelopment. It will improve the health and well-being of the urban population, focusing on the \npoor and the vulnerable, and provide them with equitable access to quality health services. \nProgram  interventions  are  well  justified,  focusing  on  key  results  that  are  prioritized  and \nsequenced  to  improve  NUHM  implementation  performance  in  accordance  with  its  core \nstrategies. The program addresses current inefficiencies in the delivery of urban health care by \nstrengthening overall health systems and focusing resources on comprehensive primary health \n                                                \n9  Program Soundness Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ncare. While the  program reinforces  public  provisioning  of  essential  health  services,  it  also \nfacilitates partnerships with the private health sector to improve health services coverage and \nthe continuum of care. The program promotes cross-sectoral convergence to address key \ndeterminants of urban health both within and beyond the health sector. The program has a \nstrong gender focus. Sustainability of results will be ensured through the program\u2019s focus on \nstrengthening institutions and significant capacity building.  \n \n24.  The  economic  analysis  weighed  the  program\u2019s  benefits  relative  to  its  costs.  The \neconomic benefits are from (i) reduced mortality rates, (ii) increased health facility utilization, (iii) \nincreased productivity and out-of-pocket health care cost savings, and (iv) productivity gains in \nterms of decreased disability-adjusted life years.10 The economic analysis yielded an economic \ninternal rate of return of 13%. The economic internal rate of return is sensitive to changes in \npopulation coverage. Thus, reaching more beneficiaries would ensure the program\u2019s economic \nviability.  \n \n25.  The program is categorized as gender equity. It has a strong gender and pro-poor focus. \nHealth interventions directly target the poor while also allocating greater resources to the needs \nof women and girls, especially their reproductive health. Health service providers will be trained \nto be responsive to specific needs and concerns of women and girls and to improve their \ninteractions  with  poor  and  marginalized  communities.  Through  community  outreach  and \ncounselling services, women and girls will be empowered to realize their health rights and \naddress issues of gender-based violence. The program will also help improve the working \nconditions and career trajectories of female health workers.  \n \nB.  Program System Assessments \n \n26.  Monitoring and evaluation systems. The M&E system assessment found that the \nNUHM\u2019s monitoring framework, comprising oversight and steering committees, MIS, and annual \ncommon review missions, is robust for tracking the program\u2019s outputs and outcome.11 Common \nreview missions consist of  officials from  MOHFW, state health departments, and technical \nexperts; development partners can be invited to participate. The areas for further strengthening \ninclude: (i) enhancing existing systems to track information specific to the NUHM\u2019s progress and \nmain program beneficiaries (the urban poor and vulnerable groups), (ii) building the capacity of \ndata entry operators and MIS officers at all levels, (iii) harmonizing the operability of multiple \nsystems, and (iv) providing adequate resources to improve coverage and accuracy of reporting \nand  availability  of  quality  and  timely  data.  MOHFW  will  be  responsible  for  performance \nmonitoring against a set of key performance indicators that are defined within the NUHM\u2019s \nimplementation and results frameworks, including DLIs and PAP targets. MOHFW will also draw \non interagency information systems to obtain urban health-related indicators in preparing annual \nperformance reports.  \n \n27.  Fiduciary systems. Rigorous financial management, procurement, and anticorruption \nsystems assessments confirm that the program systems are adequate for results-based lending \nwith some risk mitigation measures.12 The overall financial management risk is moderate. Areas \nfor  improvement  include:  (i)  timely  release  of  funds  from  state  treasuries  to  state  health \n                                                \n10 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Common review missions will cover results, technical, and fiduciary aspects of the program. Program Monitoring \nand Evaluation System Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "9 \nsocieties, and (ii) timely financial reporting and auditing. The PAP includes the following risk \nmitigation  measures:  (i)  enhancing  fiduciary  performance  monitoring,  (ii)  supporting  staff \ncapacity development, (iii) ADB participation in annual common review missions of MOHFW\u2019s \nfinancial management group, and (iv) provision of program financial statements following a \nStatement of Audit Needs. \n \n28.  The program will entail procurement of civil works, drugs, and consumables; furniture \nand  equipment  at  health  facilities;  and  consulting  services,  all  of  which  will  be  sourced \ndomestically. Overall procurement risk is substantial mainly due to (i) lack of adequately trained \nstaff  in  some  states,  and  (ii)  inadequate  quality  assurance  mechanisms  and  supply \nmanagement, especially for drugs in some states. The risks will be mitigated by ensuring \nadequate number of qualified procurement staff (DLI 6) and implementing pre- and post-delivery \nquality checks of drugs and annual post-procurement reviews in at least three states (PAP). The \nprogram  will  strengthen  the  implementation  of  the  NHM  Governance  and  Accountability \nFramework, grievance  redressal  mechanism,  and  community  processes  in  service  delivery \nmonitoring. The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited \nActivities in Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to, and discussed with, the \ngovernment and MOHFW.13  \n \n29.  Safeguard  systems.  This  program  is  categorized  as  B  for  environment,  C  for \ninvoluntary resettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. Potential environmental impacts include \nthose from construction and refurbishing of urban primary health facilities and generation of \nbiomedical  waste  and  infection  risks  during  operation.  The  program  safeguard  system \nassessment examined environmental safeguard management and compliance aspects of NHM \nrelative to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The assessment found that a wide range \nof policies, laws, and regulations related to environmental issues are in place. The existing \nguidelines related to environmental management will be strengthened to guide central and state \ninstitutions and health facilities in urban areas. Environment and social safeguard elements will \nbe incorporated in the quality assurance tools to ensure proper monitoring and compliance. For \npotential  impacts  of  involuntary  resettlement  associated  with  the  program\u2019s  civil  works,  a \nscreening procedure has been developed to ensure that the program excludes any activities \nthat may trigger category A or B. The PAP includes raising awareness, training of staff on \nsafeguards, and enforcement of specific environmental regulations.  \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5.14 Overall program risk \nis assessed as substantial, but appropriate risk mitigation measures have been incorporated in \nthe DLIs and PAP to ensure further strengthening of systems and achievement of program \noutcome. The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.    \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2013. Piloting Results-Based Lending for Programs.
