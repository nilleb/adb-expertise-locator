The Government of the Philippines has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto provide advisory technical assistance (TA) to assist in operationalizing, at the country level, \nthe commitments reflected in the Paris Declaration.1 The TA is included in the Country Strategy \nand Program for the Philippines (CSP), 2005\u20132007.2 The Fact-Finding Mission fielded during 1\u2013\n23 August 2005, reached an understanding with the Government on the TA's purpose, scope, \nimplementation mechanisms, and financing arrangements. Appendix 1 gives the design and \nmonitoring framework for the TA. The TA is an integral part of the results-based management \n(RBM) framework adopted in the CSP.  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Following the 2003 Rome Roundtable for Harmonization and the 2005 High-Level Forum \non Harmonization and Aid Effectiveness, the Government requested ADB to provide TA to \nsupport its efforts within this global harmonization framework, and to strengthen the Philippines \nCountry Harmonization Program (PCHP). It comprises two main pillars: to improve development \neffectiveness;  and  to  implement  and  institutionalize  better  results  management  and  good \npractices to improve governance. The TA supports the efforts of the development partner \ncommunity  to  coordinate,  streamline,  and  harmonize  operational  policies,  procedures,  and \npractices with Government systems.  \n \n3.  The  Government  has  a  strong  sense  of  ownership  of  and  commitment  to  the \nharmonization initiative, has allocated counterpart resources, and established an institutional \nframework under the Harmonization Committee (HC).3 The HC is assigned the anchor role and \nwill work closely with development partners to implement the PCHP. HC\u2019s mandate includes \nsuch priority areas as procurement; financial management and financial auditing; managing for \nresults through performance-based budgeting; and enhancing project quality through improved \nprocedures in the areas of environment, gender, and land acquisition and resettlement (LAR). \nWhile significant progress has been made in some of these areas, especially procurement, \nmuch remains to be done. The TA will focus on identifying and resolving (i) generic issues \naffecting the harmonization agenda (including policy, legal, regulatory and institutional aspects \nof the framework); and (ii) gaps between the Government\u2019s and major partners\u2019 processes that \ninhibit alignment. The TA will also recommend activities that will yield \u201cquick wins\u201d on country-\nlevel components and tasks.   \n \n4.  Currently,  in  the  Philippines,  project  quality  and  improved  project  management  are \nconstrained by weaknesses in procedures and processes, as well as by governance problems \nsuch  as  bureaucracy  and  red  tape.  Project  preparation  and  implementation  are  at  times \nsubstantially delayed particularly due to differences in processes among Government agencies, \nbetween the Government and development partners, and among development partners. Efforts \nto harmonize local procurement procedures with development partners' processes have not \ntotally borne fruit since much support is still needed to extensively implement and institutionalize \nthese  procedures.  Reforms  in  financial  management  and  audit  are  long  overdue.  The \nGovernment confirmed that agencies need to coordinate actions in addressing country-level \nalignment issues particularly in financial reporting. Initial efforts to improve existing practices \n                                                 \n1  The Paris Declaration on improving development effectiveness through ownership, harmonization, alignment, \nresults, and mutual accountability resulted from the high-level forum organized by the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development \u2013 Development Assistance Committee held in Paris, France, in March 2005.  \n2  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 14 June 2004.  \n3  The HC is chaired by the Department of Finance (DOF) with members from the National Economic Development \nAuthority (NEDA), Department of Budget Management (DBM), and the Commission on Audit (COA). ", " 2   \nneed  to  be  enhanced  by  the  availability  of  technical  assistance  and  financial  resources. \nSimilarly, managing for results started to gain ground with the Government's commitment to fully \ninstitutionalize performance-based budgeting and expenditure management in all agencies. The \nshort-term  gains,  however,  need  to  be  further  sustained  by  strengthening  the  institutional \ncapacity of oversight and line agencies, and later on all levels of the Government. Improving \nproject quality at entry is a major challenge, as there are unresolved issues in the Government's \nprocessing procedures, particularly for LAR and environmental clearance. The outcomes of the \nTA  will  make  the  development  business  more  efficient,  thereby  producing  impacts  in  a \nshortened time frame. \n \n5.  The Department of Finance (DOF) is ADB's counterpart oversight agency and plays a \nmajor role as chair of HC. As the borrower for official development assistance (ODA) loans and \nlead fiscal agency of the Government, DOF chairs the interagency Investment Coordination \nCommittee (ICC), which reviews and approves all foreign-assisted projects executed by the line \nand sector agencies. Other agencies involved in harmonization activities include the National \nEconomic and Development Authority (NEDA), the central planning agency that coordinates \nand  monitors  ODA  and  also  acts  as  secretariat  to  the  ICC;  Department  of  Budget  and \nManagement  (DBM),  which  is  in  charge  of  the  Government's  budgeting  and  expenditure \nmanagement,  and  also  oversees  procurement;  Commission  on  Audit  (COA),  primarily \nconcerned  with  financial  reporting  and  audit;  and  agencies  such  as  the  Department  of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources (DENR) and Urban Assets Reform Project Management \nOffice (UARPMO).  \n \n6.  In the past, ADB supported harmonization efforts by contributing substantially in the \nmultistakeholder work on procurement and financial management reforms and the creation of \nHC. ADB coordinated several Government and development partner forums, which agreed on \nformulating  and  implementing  a  harmonization  framework  for  the  Philippines,  and  solicited \nsupport in moving the Paris agenda forward at the country level. 4 \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcomes \n7.  The TA's primary objective is to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of development by \n(i) encouraging rationalized and simplified procedures for better implementation of development \nprojects, (ii) aligning development partner activities with the Government\u2019s planning cycle and \ndevelopment agenda, and (iii) harmonizing the development partners\u2019 policies and procedures \namong themselves and with those of the Government\u2019s to minimize costs and delays. The TA \nwill focus on achieving interim results of (i) helping the Government achieve the harmonization \nobjectives as defined in the Paris Declaration, and developing a tracking mechanism to monitor \nthe country\u2019s progress toward meeting the identified country-level indicators; (ii) further raising \nthe level of harmonization in standard bidding procedures and bidding documents for local \ncompetitive bidding for goods, works, and consulting services; (iii) enhancing the Government\u2019s \ncapacity for financial management and audit and developing technical readiness to create a \n                                                 \n4  ADB, World Bank and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) have worked closely with the Government, \nparticularly on harmonization efforts for procurement and financial management. The World Bank and JBIC have \nconfirmed the TA will complement their ongoing harmonization activities, and sustain discussions on possible \nactivities towards development partner alignment and harmonization with existing Government practices. Further, \nADB co-chaired with the Government a development partner forum in April 2005 that discussed overall country and \ndevelopment partners\u2019 efforts in meeting commitments under the Paris Declaration. A second forum will be held in \nNovember 2005 to maintain momentum among development partners.  \n ", "  3\nmore effective and efficient financial management and monitoring system for public resource \nutilization  and  management,  especially  for  ODA  programs;  (iv)  enhancing  the  planning-\nbudgeting  nexus  by  identifying  a  results  framework  for  performance  budgeting,  including \nstrengthening the Government\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency reviews (EERs) and organizational \nperformance  indicator  framework  (OPIF);5  and  (v)  improving  the  effectiveness  of  ODA  by \nensuring quality at entry of projects through alignment of the Government's practices with \ndevelopment  partners\u2019  safeguard  policies  in  the  areas  of  gender,  resettlement,  and \nenvironment.  \n \n8.  The  envisaged  impacts  in  realizing  the  outcomes  are  improved  development \neffectiveness, reduced transaction costs leading to higher levels of public investments, and \npoverty reduction through improved processing and implementation of development programs. \nThe detailed design and monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Key activities of the TA are divided into four parts (A\u2013D), and implemented in two \nphases. Phase 1, the first 2 months of TA implementation, covers part A, to (i) assist the HC \nconduct  a  stocktaking  of  the  Government\u2019s  harmonization  achievements,  (ii)  summarize \nharmonization initiatives of development partners, and (iii) define harmonization activities to be \nincluded in the three other parts, including an action plan covering in detail activities needed to \ncomply  with  the  Paris  Declaration.  This  activity  will  help  the  Government  translate  global \ncommitments  into  practical  interventions  at  the  country  level.  The  action  plan  will  be \ncomplemented  with  a  monitoring  mechanism  to  track  the  developments  and  progress  of \ncountry-level initiatives against the identified global commitments. Phase 1 is critical as it will \nidentify the detailed activities required in implementing the other components of the TA.  \n \n10.  Phase 2 will consist of parts B, C, D, and the continuation of part A. This phase will help \nthe Government achieve the envisaged harmonization results. The continuation of part A will \nsupport other activities by the HC such as advocacy and dissemination, as well as the overall \nmanagement of the TA. This will be in the form of training, management and logistics support, \nand technical assistance on the major activity gaps perceived by the HC. Discussions between \nand among the Government and development partners on harmonizing development planning, \nstrategy formulation, programming, and monitoring will be included in this component. \n \n11.  Part B will assist the Government to improve procedures in procurement, and financial \nmanagement and audit. In procurement, the TA will provide continuous support to the efforts \nalready  started  by  the  Government  and  other  stakeholders  toward  procurement  reforms, \nspecifically through the rollout of generic procurement manuals to regions, as well as of the \nprofessionalization program for procurement practitioners. Under financial management and \naudit, the TA will determine the extent of alignment with the New Government Accounting \nSystem  (NGAS)  with  international  accounting  standards  (IAS),  international  public  sector \naccounting standards (IPSAS), and other relevant standards, and compare it with accounting \nsystems of other countries. This component will explore mechanisms for harmonizing the NGAS \nwith  other  agencies'  systems  such  as  the  e-Budget  system  of  DBM,  and  e-LGU  of  the \nCommission  on  Information  and  Communication  Technology  (CICT)  \u2013  National  Computer \nCenter (NCC).  \n                                                 \n5 The EERs evaluate existing budgetary programs, activities, and projects according to their relevance in attaining \ndesired sectoral and departmental outcomes. The OPIF works in tandem with the EERs to increase agencies\u2019 \naccountability  through  reporting  of  their  outputs  and  outcomes  that  measure  the  agency  impact  on  the \ndevelopment goals and objectives of the Government Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan. The OPIF is \nfundamental for operationalizing planning and budgeting reforms. \n ", " 4   \n  \n12.  Part  C  will  assist  DBM  to  improve  the  Government\u2019s  budget  and  expenditure \nmanagement; and enhance the planning-budgeting nexus by identifying a results framework for \nperformance budgeting, including strengthening the EERs and the OPIF. It will increase DBM\u2019s \ncapacity to (i) review the OPIF Congressional budget submission pilot experience and to identify \nand introduce standard processes for the rollout to the remaining departments, and (ii) to pilot \nprocesses for facilitating the performance orientation of selected agencies. The TA will continue \nthe work of RETA 60966 for Supporting the Sector Approach and RBM in ADB Operations. In \nparticular, the RETA is assisting DBM in (i) facilitating and supervising the preparation of OPIF-\nbased budgets for all departments to be included in the 2006 Congressional budget submission; \n(ii)  developing  processes  for  assisting  a  stronger  management  for  development  results \norientation  in  up  to  four  departments;  and  (iii)  increasing  transparency  on  OPIF  and \nstrengthening coordination with other agencies, particularly NEDA and COA.  \n \n13.  Part D will improve the effectiveness of ODA by ensuring quality at entry of projects. This \ncomponent will basically work at streamlining processes for better and faster development \nresults, and will cover the following: (i) environment, (ii) gender, and, (iii) LAR. The TA will \nassess the possibility of using DENR\u2019s environmental impact assessment (EIA) in lieu of the \nvarious  systems  and  requirements  of  the  development  partners  for  project  environmental \nassessment, taking off from what has been initiated by the World Bank. It will also provide \ncapacity building to enable DENR's Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) to use and \nappraise  strategic/programmatic  environmental  assessment  for  sector  programs  and  ODA-\nfunded  projects  to  graduate  from  the  usual  piecemeal  approach  to  evaluation.  In  gender \nharmonization,  the  main  objective  is  to  help  NEDA  disseminate  and  build  capacity  within \nGovernment institutions at the national and at local levels to apply the gender and development \n(GAD) guidelines in project development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. It will also \nassess the institutional capacity of agencies to carry out the GAD guidelines, which will become \nthe basis of the envisaged capability building program. For LAR, the TA will build on the \nactivities initiated by RETA 59357 for national resettlement policies and by the sector work \ncarried out in the past 3 years to advance harmonization of development partners' and national \nLAR practices. The TA will assess the level of coordination among agencies with a role in LAR, \nand their technical capacity and staffing needs for this task. On the basis of the assessment, the \nTA  will  recommend  administrative  changes  and  task  organization,  and  outline  the  needed \ntechnical training and capacity building. The TA will also outline specific actions to sustain the \npresentation of Republic Act 89748 amendment to Congress, and assist in preparing IRRs. In \nparallel with these activities, the TA will initiate the drafting of new IRRs through an intensive \nconsultation process across government agencies and through studies aimed at defining the \neffective mechanisms to improve, coordinate, and speed up the various tasks composing the \nLAR process. UARPMO will implement this component.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,000,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \ncurrency of $329,400 and local currency of $670,600. ADB will provide a grant of $700,000 \nequivalent to finance in full the foreign currency cost and $370,600 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003.

The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  DOF, as chair of the HC, will act as Executing Agency of the TA, with the HC setting the \ndirection and implementing an action plan to track progress at the country level. The HC, \ncomposed of senior officials from different agencies (at least assistant secretary level) will also \nserve as the steering committee to oversee implementation, and resolve policy issues related to \nthe TA. A secretariat to the steering committee composed of technical-level staff representatives \nfrom  each  agency,  with  DOF  as  lead,  will  coordinate  the  efforts  of  the  various  agencies \ninvolved, and track and report the progress of TA implementation. The steering committee, with \nthe help of the secretariat, will also be responsible for coordination, facilitation, and supervision \nof the work of the consultants. For part A, consultant and staff resources will be provided by \nADB to assist HC in developing and implementing an action plan and supporting the overall \nharmonization program. For parts B, C, and D, each agency will commit one senior official and \nan appropriate number of technical staff to do the policy work as well as the technical and \nadministrative work expected under the TA. Further, to aid the Government in TA execution and \nmonitoring, ADB\u2019s Philippines Country Office will support TA coordination and implementation, \nand provide feedback to other development partners on the progress, achievements, and issues \nrelated to the TA. A total of 62 (14 international and 48 domestic) person-months of consulting \nservices will be required. \n \n16.  The Government will commit the required amount of counterpart funding by providing \noffice space and staff resources. This counterpart will be coshared by the various implementing \nagencies identified in the TA. \n \n17.  ADB  in  coordination  with  the  Government,  through  the  DOF,9  will  directly  recruit \nindividual international and domestic consultants required for each part of the TA following \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging domestic consultants. The terms of reference for consulting services with details on \nthe duration of services and reporting arrangements are attached as Appendix 3. The TA will \nbegin in November 2005 and will be implemented for over 2 years (24 months): (phase 1 \u2013 \nDecember 2005\u2013January 2006; phase 2 \u2013 January 2006\u2013September 2007). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for Harmonization and Managing for Results, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n9  ADB will send the final candidates\u2019 names to DOF and ask if it objects to any, based on previous experience with \nthem. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact       \n\u2022 Improved development  \u2022 More resources and  \u2022 Government growth and  \u2022 Assumption: Full \neffectiveness, reduced  budget allocated to pro- ODA statistics; ADB  commitment of \ntransaction costs leading to  poor public investments;  project monitoring reports   Government and \nhigher levels of public  lower or no attrition of  development partners \ninvestments, and poverty  proposed projects; and   \nreduction through improved  improved implementation   \nprocessing and implementation  of development projects \nof development programs   \nOutcomes       \n\u2022 Part A.
