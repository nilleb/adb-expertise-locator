This regional technical assistance (RETA) will help the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand its developing member countries better institutionalize antitrafficking1 and safe migration \nconcerns  into  subregional  cooperation  and  integration  initiatives.  The  focus  will  be  on  the \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and South Asia.2 The RETA, which will strengthen ADB\u2019s \npartnerships with regional institutions within and across subregions, is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Strategy 3  and  incorporates  feedback  from  ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries. During the February 2008 Fact-Finding Mission, discussions with \nkey regional partners and governments confirmed the relevance of the proposed activities, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost  estimates,  and  terms  of  reference.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  During the last decade accelerated globalization and migration have increased global \nattention  on  human  trafficking. 5  Targeted  projects  in  source  areas,  transit  points,  and \ndestinations provided awareness raising campaigns; community-based monitoring; livelihood \ndevelopment,  and  empowerment  of  women  and  girls;  legal  protection  and  advice  for \nprosecution,  improvement  of  labor  standards  in  small  factories,  and  skills  training  for \nreintegration. Some have achieved notable success. Progress has been also made in clarifying \nconcepts (e.g., definition of human trafficking, push and pull factors, links between trafficking \nand migration), consolidating research and good practice databases, increasing commitment by \ngovernments to combat the problem as reflected by the signing of international conventions, \nregional declarations, bilateral agreements, and country plans of actions; and recognizing the \nneed for multidisciplinary and multistakeholder approaches.  \n \n3.  The annual trafficking in persons report, published by the United States\u2019 Department of \nState, has been instrumental in drawing worldwide attention to the need for urgent actions. \nSince 2001 the report has ranked countries according to their performance in addressing human \ntrafficking; American bilateral and multilateral foreign assistance reflects this ranking.6 \n \n4.  The issue of human trafficking is highly relevant to ADB\u2019s regional cooperation agenda. \nFirst, evidence is growing of the links between improved rural\u2013urban and regional connectivity, \nand increased vulnerability to human trafficking and unsafe migration, especially in the context \n                                                 \n1   The term \u2018antitrafficking\u2019 is used in the document to refer to the initiatives and concerns that aim to prevent and \nreduce individuals\u2019 risks of being trafficked for exploitation. \n2   The selection of the two subregions is based on needs and gaps identified from ADB experience, the recognized \nroles of ADB on this topic, and consultations with ADB staff in charge of regional cooperation in key subregions. \nThe RETA is in line with the regional cooperation strategies and programs for the GMS and South Asia. See \nADB. 2004. Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (2004\u20132008): Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila; and \nADB. 2005. Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (2006\u20132008): South Asia. Manila.  \n3   ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in  ADB Business Opportunities on 17 January 2008. Funding from the Regional \nCooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility \nwas approved on 10 September 2007. \n5   In Asia the key financiers of antitrafficking initiatives include the governments of the United States, United \nKingdom, Norway, and Australia. They have channeled funds through the United Nations technical agencies, \ne.g., International Labour Organization, International Organization for Migration, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, \nUnited Nations Development Fund for Women, and more recently United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime; \ngovernments,  and  nongovernment  organizations.  The  private  sector  is  increasing  becoming  involved,  for \nexample, Microsoft, Manpower, and GAP. \n6   The 2007 report is available at: http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2007/.  \n ", "2   \nof poorly implemented development policies.7 As a leader in facilitating improved connectivity, \nADB should ensure that governments provide necessary legal frameworks and law enforcement \nto make the mobility of people safe, especially for women and children. This requires the \nintegration of trafficking and safe migration concerns into regional and cross-border corridors \nand  connectivity  planning.  Second,  as  a  regional  development  bank,  ADB  is  expected  to \ncatalyze regional policy dialogue, partner with other regional institutions, and contribute to \nquality policy research on key regional public goods issues, including human trafficking and safe \nmigration. ADB recognizes these two roles in its Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy.  \n \n5.  To date, ADB support to antitrafficking and safe migration include three RETAs: one in \nSouth Asia (2001\u20132003),8 one in the GMS (2004\u20132007),9 and another in the GMS to integrate \nantitrafficking and safe migration messages with HIV/AIDS and nontraditional drug use among \nethnic minority groups (2005\u20132007).10 In addition, ADB\u2019s 18 transport loan projects since 2002 \nhave  included  sensitization  components  on  human  trafficking.  These  efforts  have  largely \nfocused  on  regional  policy  dialogue;  regional,  country,  and  local  research;  community \nawareness raising and targeted communication program development; empowerment of women \nand girls; targeted poverty reduction; and community-based monitoring. \n \n6.  Through these ADB has gained substantial institutional knowledge on (i) key issues, \nbottlenecks, and stakeholders in the GMS and South Asia; (ii) ways to develop and implement \nproject components to reduce vulnerability to human trafficking and unsafe migration; and  \n(iii) ways, at the project level, to engage line ministries (transport sector, in particular) that do not \nnormally deal with trafficking or migration issues. Through this process, ADB has refined its \nunique role in addressing trafficking and safe migration issues.  \n \n7.  ADB has successfully facilitated regional policy dialogue to develop regional institutional \nframeworks.  In  the  GMS,  ADB  contributed  to  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  the \nmemorandum  of  understanding  of  the  Coordinated  Mekong  Ministerial  Initiative  against \nTrafficking (COMMIT) by providing funding support to the United Nations Inter-Agency Project \non Human Trafficking in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region (UNIAP), a secretariat for COMMIT. In \nSouth Asia, key government decision-makers and leading nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nfrom Bangladesh, India, and Nepal came together to discuss a range of bilateral and regional \nissues, including the 2002 Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and \nChildren for Prostitution by the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).  \n \n8.  However,  major  gaps  still  exist  in  mainstreaming  and  integrating  these  efforts  into  \n(i) ADB-assisted subregional cooperation and economic integration, such as the GMS and the \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC); and (ii) subregional policy dialogue. \nGiven  their  cross-cutting  nature,  human  trafficking  and  safe  migration  issues  need  to  be \naddressed through and side-by-side with such economic sectors as transport, tourism, and \ntrade, among others. At the same time, ADB is expected to play a stronger role in facilitating \n                                                 \n7   Chamberlain, J. 2006. Research Report: Lao PDR.

The  GMS  leads  other  subregional  initiatives  in  integrating  antitrafficking  and  safe \nmigration concerns. The GMS Working Group on Human Resource Development (WGHRD) \nconsiders cross-cutting social dimensions, including human trafficking and safe labor migration. \nHowever, its approach to these issues is still ad hoc; it does not have systematic links with \nCOMMIT and its subregional plan of action (SPA). The group\u2019s capacity to work with other GMS \nthematic working groups, such as transport, tourism, and trade, needs to be strengthened to \naddress trafficking and safe migration concerns, building upon pilot interventions under the \nrecently  completed  RETA  6190  (footnote  9).  An  informal  group  on  social  development \nestablished during WGHRD\u2019s eighth meeting in May 2007 offers an opportunity. An ongoing \nRETA11 is facilitating a consultative process to develop a GMS\u2013WGHRD strategic framework. \nFurther technical and secretariat assistance is needed for the social development subgroup to \ndevelop and implement a more detailed strategic action framework specific to their concerns, \nwhile establishing its membership, roles, and accountability mechanism. The group should be \nassisted to take a proactive role in interacting with other thematic working groups through joint \ntraining and cross-border planning.  \n \n10.  SASEC  does  not  have  a  focal  working  group  on  human  development  or  social \ndevelopment that corresponds to WGHRD in the GMS. Even in the few cases where ADB has \nprovided support to develop a component on trafficking sensitization and community monitoring \nwith cross-border projects under SASEC, these activities were carried out in isolation from any \nnational or regional action plans on combating human trafficking. With no focal point on cross-\nborder social issues, SASEC operations have missed opportunities to promote safe and regular \nmigration through such sectors as transport, trade and customs, and possibly regional tourism. \nAs SASEC moves from its project focus to cross-border agreements and interventions in the \nmedium  term,  trafficking  and  safe  migration  concerns  must  be  integrated  into  any  overall \nframework. Global and regional good practices should be introduced to find ways to systematize \nand institutionalize these concerns into cross-border and connectivity planning under SASEC.  \n \n11.  Regional policy dialogue support remains important. Now recognized as an important \nregional participant, ADB\u2019s continuing support to the COMMIT process and COMMIT SPA \n2008\u20132010 will be crucial to sustain ongoing regional policy dialogue on antitrafficking and safe \nmigration and to strengthen the linkage between the GMS WGHRD and COMMIT.  \n \n12.  In South Asia, numerous bilateral initiatives and NGO regional networks are in place, but \nno single comprehensive regionwide platform equivalent to COMMIT in the GMS countries is in \nplace for government and nongovernment sectors. The 2002 SAARC convention remains the \nonly regional platform but with a limited scope. Its effective implementation has been hampered \nby its limited legal provisions (e.g., form of exploitation is limited to prostitution) and weak \ninstitutional structure (e.g., no accountability required for signing countries). The United Nations \nDevelopment  Fund  for  Women  and  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund,  in  collaboration  with \ngovernments and NGOs, have facilitated advocating for some changes in the convention. But \nmore support for regionwide discussions is needed, especially for the SAARC summit in Sri \nLanka in 2009.  \n \n                                                 \n11   ADB. 2007.

While challenges and solutions are country and subregion specific, key stakeholders \nconsider  exchanges  between  countries  and  subregions  to  be  useful.  Cross-country  and \nsubregional training is often instrumental in stimulating new ideas and changes in terms of \noperating modalities and project design.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The expected impact of the RETA is enhanced integration of concerns about human \ntrafficking and safe migration of women and children into ADB-assisted subregional cooperation \nand integration strategies and interventions. The two distinct but interrelated outcomes will be \n(i) enhanced mainstreaming of human trafficking and safe migration concerns within the GMS \nand SASEC, and (ii) enhanced regional policy dialogue and partnerships on these topics in the \nGMS and South Asia.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n  1.   GMS (Part A)  \n \n15.  Output 1: Capacity Development of WGHRD\u2019s Social Development Subgroup. The \nRETA will facilitate a consultative process for developing a GMS strategy on human trafficking \nand safe migration within the overall WGHRD strategic framework (to be developed under \nongoing RETA 6413 [footnote 11]) and the COMMIT SPA, and help the social development \nsubgroup implement it. It will provide technical and secretariat assistance to formalize the terms \nof reference and strengthen the capacity of the newly formulated social development subgroup \nunder the GMS\u2013WGHRD. The RETA will help the social development subgroup take an active \nrole  in  engaging  other  relevant  GMS  thematic  working  groups  (e.g.,  transport,  trade,  and \ntourism) and provide necessary inputs to the sector-specific training modules and community-\nbased monitoring and referral system provided by output 2.  \n \n16.  Output 2:  Support to COMMIT. To continue to support the COMMIT process and  \nSPA 2008\u20132010, the RETA will partner with UNIAP as a secretariat for COMMIT. Building upon \nthe successful experiences of the recently completed RETA 6190 (footnote 9), the proposed \nRETA will support two suboutputs as part of the COMMIT SPA 2008\u20132010: (i) regional and local \ntraining targeted at more than 150 senior and technical government officials and NGO staff, \nusing proven interactive training modules; and special training modules catering to the needs of \nkey  GMS  economic  sectors;  and  (ii)  community-based  monitoring  and  referral  systems \nimplemented in at least two locations, along with ADB-assisted GMS regional projects that \nwould accelerate cross-border mobility.  \n \n2.   South Asia (Part B) \n \n17.   Output 3: Raising Awareness of Human Trafficking Concerns in SASEC. The RETA \nwill review the current knowledge, practices, and opportunities in relevant SASEC economic \nsectors to make the cross-border and connectivity planning and projects sensitive to the risks of \nhuman trafficking and unsafe migration. In consultation with key stakeholders, it will provide a \nroadmap with recommendations for institutionalizing these concerns into SASEC\u2019s key sector \nstrategies and work programs such as training and cross-border investments. Advisory services \nwill be provided for key sector working groups for developing strategies and projects addressing \ntrafficking and safe migration concerns.  \n ", "  5\n18.  Output 4: Policy Dialogue on the SAARC Convention. The RETA will partner with the \nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM) South Asia to prepare a discussion paper on \nimprovements to the SAARC Convention and its operating framework. A small regional working \ngroup will be established to refine the paper and recommendations, which will be discussed \nthrough regional consultative workshops for possible consideration at the 2009 SAARC summit.  \n \n  3.  Subregion (Part C) \n \n19.  Output 5:  Subregional Exchange. The RETA will provide at least three exchange \nprograms across subregions, involving the GMS, South Asia, Central Asia and Caucasus,  \nSoutheast Asia,  and  the  Pacific. To  achieve  synergies and  leverage  limited  resources,  all \ntraining and exchange programs under the RETA will utilize those offered by the International \nLabour Organization and other partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $1,000,000 (Appendix 2). The RETA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional \nCooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility established and administered by \nADB. UNIAP and IOM will provide in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The RETA will be implemented over 24 months (June 2008\u2013May 2010). In-country \nactivities will commence after a letter of no-objection is received from the respective government. \nADB through the Gender, Social Development, and Civil Society Division of the Regional and \nSustainable Development Department (RSGS) will be the Executing Agency. Throughout the \nRETA, RSGS will consult closely with and be guided by the Southeast Asia and South Asia \nregional departments and resident missions. In the GMS and SASEC, a government focal \nperson should be appointed from each of the key thematic working groups to formulate a RETA \npeer review committee, which will provide feedback on consultant inputs. RETA progress and \noutputs will be posted and updated regularly on ADB\u2019s social development website with links to \nthe GMS and SASEC websites.  \n \n22.  UNIAP will be the Implementing Agency for output 2 and IOM South Asia for output 4 to \nundertake the RETA consulting services, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  form  time  to  time),  based  on  the  single-source  selection \nprocedure. ADB will directly engage two international consultants (total of 9 person-months) and \ntwo national consultants (total of 30 person-months) on an individual basis, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. They should have knowledge and experience on \nthe interface between ADB\u2019s key economic sectors and human trafficking and migration. Outline \nterms of reference of partner agencies and consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.

United Nations Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion \n1.  United  Nations  Inter-Agency  Project  on  Human  Trafficking  in  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (UNIAP) was established in 2000 as a coordinating body of various United Nations \nagencies working on combating human trafficking and promoting safe migration in the six \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries. It serves as a secretariat to the Coordinated \nMekong  Ministerial  Initiative  against  Trafficking  (COMMIT)  and  successfully  facilitated  the \nsigning of regional memorandum of understanding by all six participating countries in 2005, and \nassisted  COMMIT  in  preparing  and  implementing  the  comprehensive  subregional  plans  of \nactions (SPA) 2005\u20132007 and 2008\u20132010. It has a regional office in Bangkok, supported by six \ncountry  offices,  and  partners  with  a  range  of  regional  institutions  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). The single-source selection is justified given UNIAP\u2019s unique position \nand  capacity  to  deliver  quality  products  on  time  demonstrated  by  its  work  with  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) regional technical assistance (RETA) for Preventing the Trafficking of \nWomen and Children and Promoting Safe Migration in the Greater Mekong Subregion (RETA \n6190).1 \n2.  UNIAP will have overall responsibility for the implementation of output 2 (support to \nCOMMIT SPA) with ADB guidance and in close coordination with the output 1 consultants. \nUNIAP will be engaged for 24 months (June 2008\u2013May 2010).  \n3.  Regional and Local Training. Tasks include the following:  \n(i)  Based on the priorities identified by the COMMIT subregional plan of action (SPA) \n2008\u20132010 and experience to date, conduct needs assessments and prepare \ntraining programs, target groups and numbers, schedules, and detailed budget of \nregional and local training on human trafficking and safe migration issues. \n(ii)  Explore ways to minimize training costs by maximizing partnerships with other \nagencies  and  institutions  (e.g.,  government  and  industry  employer  training \norganized by International Labour Organization on labor protection). \n(iii)  In close consultation with output 1 consultants, develop sensitization training \nmodules  catering  to  the  specific  needs  of  GMS  working  groups  on  human \nresource  development,  transport,  trade,  tourism,  and  other  relevant  groups. \nEnsure that outputs produced by RETA 6190 and RETA 61712 are utilized for \nthis purpose.  \n(iv)  Upon  ADB  approval  of  the  training  plan,  conduct  or  supervise  all  training \nactivities supported by the RETA, and document proceedings, accomplishments, \nand key lessons.  \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004.

Community-Based Monitoring and Referral. UNIAP\u2019s tasks include the following: \n \n(i)  In close consultation with output 1 consultants, identify at least two locations \nalong with ADB\u2019s GMS interventions where community-based monitoring and \nreferral systems would have the most demonstrable impacts.  \n(ii)  Conduct  field  assessments,  collect  baseline  data;  and  develop  specific \ninterventions, schedules, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and a \nrapid method to assess quick impacts of community-based monitoring/referral \ninterventions. In doing so, clarify the roles of different stakeholders including local \ngovernments, nongovernment and/or community-based organizations, and key \nministries.  \n(iii)  Conduct at least two sets of community-based monitoring and referral activities. \n(iv)  Develop  and  circulate  knowledge  dissemination  materials  based  on  the \nexperience.  \n5.

The office covers six South Asian countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, \nNepal,  and  Sri  Lanka)  and  provides  such  services  as  research,  legal  advice,  technical \nassistance, project implementation, and regional policy dialogue. It has strong linkages with \npartner governments and regional and local nongovernmental organizations. The single-source \nselection is justified because of IOM South Asia\u2019s unique regional capacity, expertise in human \ntrafficking and safe migration issues, extensive networks, and the intellectual and practical \nleadership demonstrated in the two previous ADB technical assistance projects (RETA 59483 \nand Technical Assistance 4085-BAN4).  \n7.
