INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the resilience and \nstability of banking systems and nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) in selected developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) by examining the causes of \nweak enabling policy environments and of financial market stakeholders\u2019 limited knowledge and \nexpertise.1 Focusing on Bangladesh and Kazakhstan, the TA team will analyze factors such as: \n(i) banking policies and practices; (ii) legal and regulatory frameworks for risk-based banking, and \nsupervision and enforcement of legal and regulatory frameworks; (iii) asset quality deterioration, \nand insolvency and resolution frameworks; (iv) deposit insurance schemes, credit information \nsystems, collateral valuation systems, and asset management systems; and (v) nonbank financial \npolicies and institutions.\n \n \n2.  The TA project is aligned with operational priorities 1, 2, 6, and 7 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nas it will support banks and nonbank financial institutions in providing financial services to micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and unbanked and underserved individuals, \nincluding women. The project will also help build market frameworks and financial infrastructure \nto create level playing fields, broaden market access, deepen and diversify markets, and enhance \nfinancial safety nets in line with international regulatory standards.2 The TA is included in the 2020 \nManagement approved results-based work plan of the Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange Department (SDCC).3\n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Finance sector development\u2014e.g., mobilizing and pooling savings, facilitating payments, \nboosting trade financing, and streamlining financial resource allocation\u2014is closely linked to \neconomic growth and poverty alleviation. Stable and broad-based financial systems ensure that \nfinancial resources are mobilized to support economic activities.4 Failure of the financial system \nto perform its functions will impose negative consequences on the economy, which could lead to \na sharp contraction in economic activity, a large increase in unemployment, a rise in poverty, and \na general loss of trust in the system.5 \n \n4.  Adverse economic and social impacts. During the last two decades going through the \n1997/98 Asian financial crisis and the 2007/2008 Global financial crisis, there have been sudden \nlarge shocks and a fall in economic activity in the region. There also have been the 2013 Taper \nTantrum,6 the lingering impacts of the US monetary policy normalization, and financial spillovers \nfrom the PRC. Since 2010, nonperforming loans (NPLs) in many economies in the region have \nalso been increasing. Such developments have raised concerns over banking stability in the \nregion.7 In 2020, economic shocks from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have \n \n1 The TA project\u2019s coverage of nonbank financial institutions will be limited to nonbank lending institutions. \n2 ADB. 2018.

Lee and P. Rosenkranz. 2019. Nonperforming Loans in Asia: Determinants and Macrofinancial Linkages. ADB \nEconomics Working Paper Series. No. 574. Manila: Asian Development Bank.  ", " \n2 \nresulted in high levels of borrowing from households and firms facing liquidity challenges. A \nlengthened and more severe economic slowdown may lead to debt distress and default, exposing \nbanks and nonbank financial institutions to credit risk and putting pressure on their profitability. \nWith an expected rise in Asia-Pacific banking's nonperforming assets by $1.4 trillion and credit \ncosts by $440 billion, adequate policy response from governments is required to meet the needs \nof the real economy.8  \n \n5.  Weak enabling policy environment and limited knowledge and expertise. The ability \nof DMCs to manage the risks is limited by the weak capacity of financial authorities and financial \ninstitutions, which is caused by weak enabling policy environments and limited knowledge and \nexpertise  of  financial  market  stakeholders.  Frameworks  and  mechanisms  to  support \nmacroprudential  supervision  and  regulation  require  strengthening.  Legal,  regulatory  and \nsupervisory frameworks must ensure that financial authorities are properly empowered to enforce \nasset  quality  and  capital  adequacy  standards  and  effective  bank  resolution  strategies.9  In \naddition,  institutions  such  as  credit  bureaus,  asset  management  companies,  and  deposit \ninsurance companies should be established or strengthened to facilitate sound risk-management \npractices. The application of international standards and best practices in many DMCs has been \nlagging. In the case of Basel III, delays in implementation are related to difficulties in adopting \nthese standards into local DMC contexts.10 The poor quality of regulatory reporting impedes the \nability of financial authorities to identify and measure nonperforming assets in a timely manner. \nWeak corporate governance and risk management, insufficient resources, and poor product \ndevelopment practices are additional factors that prevent financial institutions from making sound \nbusiness decisions. \n \n6.  All of the above factors contribute to high NPL levels in Bangladesh and Kazakhstan.11 As \nof December 2019, the NPL ratio of the Bangladesh banking sector reached 9.3%, driven \nprimarily by state-owned commercial banks, which had an NPL ratio of 23.9% (compared with an \nNPL ratio of 5.8% for private commercial banks and 5.7% for foreign commercial banks).12 The \nmarket  share  of  state-owned  commercial  banks  and  state-owned  development  financial \ninstitutions has been in decline, as they continue to face major issues such as high NPLs, low \nprofitability  because  of  higher  provision  requirements,  weak  operational  inefficiency,  weak \ngovernance, widening capital shortfalls, operational inefficiencies, scant automation, inadequate \ncredit monitoring and internal risk management, and an ineffective legal framework.13 To address \nbanking sector issues, the authorities have begun to take measures such as enforcing stronger \nregulations,  introducing  bankruptcy  laws,  and  establishing  money  loan  courts  and  credit \ninformation bureaus.14 NBFIs, while significantly fewer in number than banks, also face asset-\n \n8 S&P Global. 2020. S&P Global Ratings.  \n9 World Bank defined bank resolution as the set of procedures and measures taken by the authorities to solve the \nsituation of an unviable bank. \n10 Financial Stability Board. 2019. Basel III Implementation.  \n11 NPLs in Bangladesh are classified as substandard, doubtful, or bad or a loss, which are calculated based on uniform \ncriteria. A loan is substandard if it is overdue for 3 months or more but less than 9 months, doubtful if overdue for 9 \nmonths or more but less than 12 months, and bad or a loss if it is overdue for 12 months or more. In Kazakhstan, an \nNPLs are defined as the sum of loans classified as doubtful of 5th category and loss loans (excluding homogenous \nloans classified as doubtful of 5th category and loss loans) and provisions for homogenous loans.  \n12 CEIC.

Manila. \n14 The Money Loan Court Act 1990 introduced a court of exclusive jurisdiction for the recovery of nonperforming loans \n(NPLs) to expedite adjudication of creditors\u2019 claims. Significant improvements in the execution of the Money Loan \nCourts were made as part of the Money Loan Court Act 2003. The money loan court process, which is accepted by \nthe banks, has been instrumental in improving the speed and efficiency of collateral acquisition and disposal, and in \ngaining judgments against uncooperative debtors ", " \n3 \nquality issues. The NPL ratio for NBFIs in Bangladesh reached 9.5% in 2019, and the amount of \nloan loss provisions maintained by NBFIs was BDT9.4 billion short of the required amount in \n2019.15 \n \n7.  In Kazakhstan, the banking sector has experienced significant credit losses resulting in \nbank mergers and closures. The government had to allocate more than KZT3 trillion ($10 billion, \nor 6% of gross domestic product) to support troubled banks in 2017.16 As of end-2019, the NPL \nratio for the banking sector was 8.13%.17 An issue faced by the banking sector is the widespread \npractice of related-party lending, which has compromised strategic planning and credit risk \nmanagement, resulting in unmanageable levels of NPLs. Exacerbating this problem, banks lack \nthe  proper  internal  controls  to  manage  related-party  lending.  At  the  same  time,  financial \nauthorities must be able to identify these related parties using supervisory judgement, given that \nit is difficult to find hard evidence to prove an affiliation between two parties.18 Although the \nauthorities aim to streamline the bankruptcy law and encourage the central bank to adopt a risk-\nbased approach to bank regulation, inadequate transparency, accountability, and integrity remain \nfundamental problems among banks. Resolving them will require a comprehensive overhaul of \nthe regulatory framework\u2014not least to limit the influence of insiders and connected interests\u2014\nand a rethinking of loan subsidies (footnote 14).  \n \n8.  Lessons. The TA will draw on lessons from previous ADB projects and studies, one of \nwhich is that project design should follow a sequenced approach to reforms, building on the \npartnerships and outputs of previous projects.19 Because underreporting of NPLs undermines the \ncredibility of official statistics and confidence in banking regulations, central banks need to \nstrengthen macroprudential policies to ensure that commercial banks comply with rules and \nstandards. In addition, central banks need to level the playing field for micro, small and medium-\nsized enterprises (MSMEs) to access credit (footnote 20). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: resilience and stability of financial markets \nimproved (footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: capacity in selected DMCs for \ndeveloping finance reform improved.20 \n \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output  1:  Policy  reform  recommendations  on  banking  systems  and  nonbank \nfinancial institutions developed. This output will support an analysis of banking and nonbanking \nwork in Bangladesh and Kazakhstan21 to develop tools including (i) country diagnostic study of \nthe landscape and enabling environment of the two countries, both of which exhibit high NPL \n \n15 In the Financial Stability Report of the Bangladesh Bank, NPL ratio refers to ratio of nonperforming loans and leases \nto total loans and leases. \n16 M.

Output 2: Knowledge of reforms for financial institutions improved. Building upon \nthe support provided to Bangladesh and Kazakhstan under  output 1, stakeholder capacity \ndevelopment will be carried out through a technical advisory program that will include policy \ndialogue, roundtables, and capacity building activities for policymakers, financial authorities, and \nfinancial market stakeholders in Bangladesh and Kazakhstan. This output will tap into the \nexpertise  of  international  financial  institutions  and  standard-setting  bodies  in  strengthening \nfinancial stability.22 \n \n12.  This TA will leverage ADB's partnership with the Government of the Republic of Korea \n(ROK) to draw on lessons from the ROK\u2019s experience in dealing with excessive NPLs following \nthe 1997 financial crisis. The measures taken by the Government of the ROK to deal with \nexcessive NPLs, such as setting up an asset management company, online asset disposal, and \nissuance of asset-backed securities, will be assessed and their applicability to Bangladesh and \nKazakhstan  explored.  SDCC  will  produce  knowledge  products  for  wider  dissemination  of \ninnovative ideas and lessons through ADB knowledge events. Where possible, the TA will \ncomplement and/or supplement existing and proposed initiatives. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  Eligible and Non-Eligible Expenditures. The Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund will finance operational expenses related to eligible proposals agreed upon by \nthe Government and ADB. It will not be used for (i) civil works, (ii) procurement of large-scale \nequipment, (iii) permanent staffing costs, or (iv) the hiring of staff consultants. The activities under \nthe TA will not cover any of these ineligible expenditures. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. The Finance Sector Group under the Sector Advisory Service \nCluster  of  SDCC  will  implement the TA and carry out TA administration and supervision, \nimplementation oversight, and communication with consultants and stakeholders in coordination \nwith relevant sector and thematic groups and operations departments. Activities organized under \nthe TA will include the organization and participation of ADB DMCs in virtual and face-to-face \nknowledge events, such as workshops and conferences. ADB staff involved with the TA may \nparticipate as resource persons in knowledge-sharing events, which will include eliciting feedback \n \n22 For example, the Korea Asset Management Corporation played an important role in facilitating restructuring and \ndevelopment of financial markets during the Asian financial crisis of 1997.
