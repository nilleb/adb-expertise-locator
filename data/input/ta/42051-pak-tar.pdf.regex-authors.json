As part of its Energy Efficiency Initiative,1 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in close \ncooperation with the relevant stakeholders in Pakistan assessed2 the country\u2019s energy efficiency \nframework. The findings suggest that Pakistan will achieve considerable economic and social \nbenefits by improving the existing energy efficiency policy and practices and adopting new ones. \nThese  findings  were  presented  to  the  Government  of  Pakistan  in  November  2007.  The \nGovernment requested that ADB provide assistance in (i) creating an enabling policy and \nbusiness environment for energy efficiency, and (ii) providing immediate financing of priority \nprojects. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Pakistan from 21 to 26 November 2007 and \nreached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  concerning  the  objective,  scope,  costs, \nfinancing, and implementation arrangements for this project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA). 3 The TA will support the Government in developing a comprehensive energy efficiency \ninvestment program for Pakistan. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Pakistan economy has grown at an unprecedented rate in the past 5 years. Coupled \nwith  the  rapid  population  growth,  this  economic  expansion  is  causing  energy  demand  to \nincrease sharply as Pakistan continues to industrialize and standards of living improve. The \nGovernment\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Framework  2005\u20132010  sets  out  a  challenging \nprogram to achieve 8% annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP). To meet this target, \nenergy consumption is forecast to grow at an average rate of 12% per annum, more than \ndouble the rate between 2000 and 2006. This will increasingly strain Pakistan\u2019s primary energy \nsupply sources. Rising oil consumption and flat domestic production once again will trigger a \nrapid increase in oil imports, while declining domestic natural gas reserves\u2014in the absence of \nsubstantial new discoveries\u2014will require the country to import gas for the first time in its history, \nthrough both pipelines and liquefied natural gas shipments. Electricity consumption, projected to \ngrow an average of 8% per annum until 2015 (although recent experience suggests much \nhigher demand growth), will similarly require large power generation capacity additions. Higher \nenergy demand and imports will also require massive investments in associated port terminals, \nstorage  facilities,  refining  capacity,  pipeline  and  transmission  networks,  and  surface  fuel \ntransport infrastructure. \n \n3.  During  2001\u20132006,  primary  energy  supply  increased  5.4%  per  year.  Meanwhile, \nconsumption of electricity rose at an average annual rate of 6.8%, natural gas by 10.4%, \nliquefied petroleum gas by 17.6%, and coal by 22.8%. Electricity use, in particular, is growing \nrobustly across all sectors\u2014industry, agriculture, domestic, and commercial\u2014recording a 10.2% \noverall jump in 2005\u20132006, while generation increases lagged at 9.3% during the same period. \nThus, the country faced serious peak electricity supply shortfalls of 1,500\u20132,000 megawatts \n(MW) during the summers of 2006 and 2007, necessitating significant forced outages (or load \nshedding)  that  curtailed  economic  activity  and  delivery  of  social  services.  System-wide \ntransmission  and  distribution  losses  remain  high  at  24.8%  of  dispatched  power.  Despite \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2006.  Report  of  the  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative.  Manila.  \u201cEnergy  efficiency  is  defined  as  economic \ninvestments in energy generation, delivery and end-use equipment, facilities, buildings, and infrastructure that \ndeliver higher useful energy outputs or services. Energy efficiency results in (i) lower consumption of energy, \nmeasured as energy input per unit of delivered output or service, and (ii) reduced emissions of greenhouse gases.\u201d  \n2  ADB. 2007. Implementing Energy Efficiency in Pakistan. Manila. The report was prepared under ADB. 2006. \nTechnical Assistance for Supporting the Inception of the Energy Efficiency Initiative in Developing Member \nCountries. Manila.  \n3   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 22 January 2008. \n ", "2   \ngovernment efforts to electrify all villages, about 45% of the population still does not have \naccess to grid-supplied electricity. A crisis in the energy sector has been looming for the past 2 \nyears. \n \n4.  The Government is working to resolve the energy crisis and to keep up with growing \nenergy demand. The Government\u2019s integrated power system development strategy aims to \nexpand the system focusing on large investments in the power generation, transmission, and \ndistribution subsectors. It also focuses on the development of an integrated energy model. \n \n5.  However, the Government lacks a comprehensive energy efficiency development road \nmap and investment program. Past attempts failed to incorporate energy efficiency and energy \nconservation 4  into  policy,  regulatory,  institutional,  and  market  frameworks.  International \nexperience indicates that the effective implementation and incorporation of energy efficiency \ninto  the  policy  mainstream  requires  concerted,  long-term  action  and  commitment.  The \nGovernment must lead this commitment, which should be tuned to market realities across all \neconomic sectors to help achieve the desired shifts in energy use practices, higher productivity, \nand benefits to social groups. \n \n6.  Pakistan\u2019s  current  and  projected  energy  requirements,  development  needs,  and \nresource shortages require immediate attention to improve the efficiency of energy supply and \nuse across all economic sectors, where there is much room for improvement. Former efforts in \nthis respect have demonstrated the need for a more vigorous, systematic, and long-term multi-\nstakeholder approach, marked by strong Government leadership and with optimal leveraging of \nexternal  financiers  and  market  players.  The  proper  design,  scope,  and  timing  of  such  an \ninitiative would have a significant impact on the viability and competitiveness of the large energy \nconsuming infrastructure and capital accretion slated to take place in Pakistan\u2019s expanding \neconomy over the coming decades. In addition, a sustained transition to a more energy-efficient \neconomy will provide the country with numerous additional economic, financial, environmental, \nand social benefits that will expedite development. \n \n7.  A successful long-term national energy efficiency initiative requires (i) the integration of \nenergy efficiency in all levels of national planning and public development spending; (ii) a \ncomprehensive policy and regulatory framework; (iii) energy price and utility rate-setting reforms \nand  incentives;  (iv)  a  strong  equipment  standards,  certification,  and  testing  regime;  (v) \ncomplementary alternative and renewable energy programs; and (vi) easy, widespread access \nto energy efficiency information, financing, products, and services by all categories and levels of \nenergy market players and end users. \n \n8.  The energy efficiency assessment conducted under ADB\u2019s Energy Efficiency Initiative \ndetermined  that  Pakistan  has  a  large  and  untapped  energy  efficiency  market.  It  identifies \nseveral energy efficiency improvement opportunities in gas distribution (supply side) and in the \ngovernment and residential sectors (demand side) that can be tapped into. These opportunities \nmay be explored without extensive precursor preparations, detailed policy design, or framework \n                                                 \n4  In Pakistan, the term \"energy conservation\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \"energy efficiency\". \nThe definition of energy efficiency in this report covers many diverse and distinct market segments on the supply \nside and the demand side, all targeting the creation of a low-carbon, sustainable energy future. Market segments \ninclude supply-side efficiency in generation, transmission, and distribution; grid-connected and off-grid renewable \nenergy; industrial energy efficiency, including changes in production technology; building end-use efficiency in \ncommercial, governmental, and residential sectors; municipal infrastructure (street lighting, water, waste, and \nsewage); transport efficiency, including urban mass transit; biofuel use to substitute for fossil fuels; irrigation; and \nequipment and appliance standards. As such, for the purpose of clarity, the term energy efficiency is used.  \n ", "  3\ndevelopment, achieving immediate energy savings and deferring additional supply requirements. \nFurther refinement and expansion of such options could result in a portfolio of immediate, \nbankable energy efficiency investment options for Pakistan, which the Government and ADB \nmay consider. \n \n9.  The  Government  and  domestic  consumers  consume  more  than  60%  of  Pakistan\u2019s \nenergy. The public sector is the most inefficient consumer, and the Government is looking for \nmore efficient utilization and conservation measures. The Government is eager to procure and \nadopt energy efficient technology in its operations, including the use of efficient lighting and \nheating and cooling systems in existing and new buildings, and introduction of energy-efficient \nbuilding codes. \n \n10.  The domestic sector currently uses 45% of the power supply. The most effective way to \nexpedite the use of efficient compact fluorescent lamps by domestic consumers is to inject a \nlarge volume of such lamps into the market at a low price. This approach has been successful in \nseveral countries, where it has immediately reduced customers\u2019 monthly power bills. Preliminary \nanalysis suggests that the introduction of 15 million high-quality compact fluorescent lamps into \nPakistan\u2019s domestic market would save customers $78 million over the lifetime of those bulbs \n(approximately 2 years). This money could be used more productively in the economy. In \naddition,  880  MW  of  power  demand  would  be  avoided.  The  cost  of  such  additional  new \ngeneration capacity would be $1.15 billion (at $1.3 million per MW). \n \n11.  Pakistan\u2019s gas distribution system is aging and is suffering from high technical losses \n(25\u201330%  in  some  areas  compared  to  industry  standard  5%)  that  could  be  eliminated  by \nreplacing medium- and low-pressure pipes with more efficient, corrosion-free pipes. Natural gas \naccounted for half (43 billion cubic meters) of Pakistan\u2019s primary energy supply in 2006. A more \nefficient gas distribution system would result in significant national savings (up to $580 million \nper year) and increased use of cleaner fuel by more domestic, industrial, and commercial \nconsumers. \n \n12.  The Government is committed to acquiring and implementing a phased strategy for \nundertaking a systematic, broad-based national energy efficiency program. As  a long-term \ndevelopment partner in the energy sector, ADB has been requested by the Government to \nprovide support in (i) developing and implementing an integrated energy efficiency program and \n(ii) financing priority investment projects. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  Improved energy efficiency represents a least-cost development strategy for Pakistan \nwith substantial benefits to the economy. Establishing a dynamic energy efficiency policy and \nbusiness environment, while financing priority investment projects, is an essential component of \nPakistan\u2019s energy policy and energy security strategy. The TA will enable the Government to \ndevelop and implement a comprehensive energy efficiency sector development program. \n \n14.  Efficient energy use in all sectors of the Pakistan economy will slow the overall rate of \nincrease  of  energy  demand  to  more  manageable  levels  and  reduce  potential  shortages. \nImproved  energy  efficiency  will  also  (i)  reduce  large  financial  outlays  required  to  develop \nadditional  energy  supplies  in  the  future;  (ii)  help  minimize  uneconomical  standby  capacity \n ", "4   \nrequired to cater to peak loads; (iii) reduce subsidy requirements; and (iv) defer transmission \nand distribution system expansion needs, thereby saving public funds and increasing returns on \nenergy infrastructure investments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will design a suitable program proposal that supports government efforts to \nestablish an enabling policy and business environment for energy efficiency, and to provide \nimmediate financing of priority projects. Key activities will include (i) an in-depth assessment of \nthe energy efficiency market and the economy; (ii) an awareness-building program for energy \nefficiency through short-term policy and regulatory improvement recommendations, as well as \ntargeted public relations programs; (iii) strategy and action guidelines for initiating a sustainable \nlong-term national energy efficiency program; (iv) a road map for implementing the national \nenergy efficiency program with corresponding investment plans; and (v) design of bankable \ninvestment projects. \n \n16.  The energy efficiency market assessment will comprise a detailed analysis of market \npotential and barriers; program design; resource (institutional, technical, manpower, material, \nand  financial)  evaluation;  and  effective  organizational  needs  assessment  for  undertaking \nphased,  prioritized  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  interventions  in  all  macroeconomic \nsectors and involving all stakeholder organizations as well as individual end-user interests \n(including those of the energy-poor and marginalized population segments). \n \n17.  The TA will develop recommendations for removing the institutional bottlenecks that \nhave  prevented  government-sponsored  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  programs  and \nsupport mechanisms from more effectively nurturing a nascent energy efficiency industry and \nconsumer culture. \n \n18.  After  assessing  the  energy  efficiency  market,  the  TA  will  identify  the  potential \ncommercial and economic drivers for energy efficiency. These will be further developed and \nimplemented under the proposed loan by facilitating and promoting the local energy efficiency \nmarket  and  removing  impediments  and  disincentives  for  corporate  and  end-user  energy \nefficiency investments. A suitable public and private funding mechanism for financing energy \nefficiency projects will be devised and recommended. An appropriate transaction structure then \nwill be developed for priority projects that, in the first phase, will require public-sector financing. \nThe identified and proposed investment projects will be evaluated for technical, economic, and \nfinancial viability in accordance with ADB guidelines and national and ADB safeguard policies.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $700,000. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Technical \nAssistance Special Fund. The Government will finance the remainder of the local currency costs, \nequivalent to $100,000, through in-kind contributions of the executing agencies. These will \ninclude office accommodation and facilities, local communication, counterpart staff, data, and \nother  information  needed  for  the  TA.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \nGovernment has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The Planning Commission of Pakistan, the federal agency mandated to develop and \nimplement major national programs and projects, will be the Executing Agency. The Planning \nCommission works under the overall direction of the Policy Board, which is chaired by the Prime \nMinister and comprises the deputy chairman and nine members of the Planning Commission, \nand 10 federal ministers. Various government and nongovernment agencies, institutions, and \nenergy utilities and companies relevant to energy policy, legislation, planning, management, and \nimplementation will be involved in the development of the energy efficiency program. The \nPlanning Commission will support the implementation of the TA by allocating the required staff \nresources,  appointing  counterpart  staff,  and  providing  proper  office  facilities  for  the  TA \nimplementation team. \n \n21.  The TA will require about 14 person-months of international consulting services and 25 \nperson-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. The TA will be carried out over 8 months beginning in March \n2008. Tripartite workshops will be held after the submission of the inception, interim, and draft \nfinal reports. The consultants will prepare status reports for their specific work, highlighting any \nissues that could become critical for the timely completion of the TA. The consultants will \narrange for other workshops and on-the-job training for Planning Commission staff as necessary. \nThe international consultants will have practical knowledge and expertise in energy efficiency \nand demand-side issues, energy efficiency project management, project and energy economics, \nfinancial analysis and financial management, and energy-system planning. ADB will engage a \nconsulting  firm  or  consortium  of  firms  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be recruited using the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures,  and  simplified  technical  proposals  will  be \nrequested. Equipment to be financed under the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Pakistan  for  preparing  the  Sustainable  Energy  Efficiency  Development \nProgram, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nDesign  Performance  Assumptions \nSources/Reporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nCreation of a dynamic  A national energy efficiency  Government decisions  The program is \nenergy efficiency policy  program approved by March    implemented efficiently \nand business  2009   Annual national  and effectively \nenvironment, an essential    statistics   \ncomponent of Pakistan\u2019s  Priority energy efficiency    Program is approved \nleast-cost energy  investments made by 2010  Energy utility reports  and financing is \ndevelopment strategy  available \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nAgreement on the  Loan and program agreements  Asian Development  Stakeholders agree and \nsustainable energy  signed by December 2008  Bank (ADB) Board of  support the program \nefficiency development  Directors approval  design \nprogram design   \nLoan and project \nagreements \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n       \nThe Government enabled  In-depth assessment of energy  Technical assistance  Government remains \nto develop and implement  efficiency market and economy  implementation  committed to reforms \na comprehensive energy  completed by July 2008  progress reports    \nefficiency program      Risk \nShort-term policy and regulatory  Consultations with   \nimprovement recommendations  Executing Agency   Delays in project \nand targeted public relations  preparation and \nprograms developed by August  approvals \n2008   \n   \nStrategy and action plans for \ninitiating a long-term national \nenergy efficiency program \ndeveloped by September 2008 \n \nRoad map for implementing the \nnational energy efficiency \nprogram with corresponding \ninvestment plans prepared by \nSeptember 2008 \n \nPriority investment projects \nidentified and prepared by \nOctober 2008 \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.1  Technical assessment completed by July 2008  ADB: $600,000 \n1.2  Financial and economic analysis completed by July 2008   \n1.3  Financial management assessment completed August 2008  Government: $100,000 \n1.4  Social safeguard assessment reports completed August 2008  equivalent \n1.5  Project feasibility report completed October 2008 \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2  7\n \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nCountry/Project Title:  Pakistan: Preparing the Sustainable Energy Efficiency Development Program \n \nLending/Financing  Sector Development Program  Department/  Central and West Asia Department, \nModality:  Division:  Infrastructure Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis, describe how \nthe project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction \nstrategy of the partner country. \n \nThe Government of Pakistan is committed to using economic development to reduce poverty. One way to tackle \npoverty by enhancing economic growth is through sustainable energy supply and access. This constitutes a national \ngoal because of the energy sector\u2019s influence on achieving other development goals. Pakistan\u2019s economic growth is \nnegatively impacted by the energy sector crisis. Despite recent efforts to increase capacity and supply, the entire \nenergy system suffers from inefficient operations. Improved energy efficiency is a key component of the least-cost \ndevelopment and poverty-reduction strategy. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);   Geographic (TI-G);   Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, \nM2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe Government is committed to acquiring and implementing a phased strategy for undertaking a systematic, broad-\nbased national energy efficiency program. This would allow for a revival and enhancement of existing energy \nefficiency capability in the country in the short and medium terms in a sustainable manner, while consolidating and \nexpanding them in the medium to long term. Such a phased approach would call for a series of sequential and/or \noverlapping actions that could ultimately be mutually reinforcing and will require policy and investment support.  \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \n \nThe project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) team will be filled with appropriate skills and expertise to examine \nthe overall social and economic policy aspects of the proposed energy efficiency program. \n  \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g. social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe proposed intervention will incorporate required social safety and protection measures that will be designed in \naccordance with the public needs. The program will be comprehensive and will require appropriate tariff reforms. \nEfficient energy use in all sectors of the Pakistani economy will help reduce the overall rate of increase of energy \ndemand to more manageable levels and reduce potential shortages. Energy efficiency can reduce the large financial \noutlays required for developing additional energy supplies in future. It can also help minimize uneconomical standby \ncapacity required to cater to peak loads, reduce subsidy requirements, and defer transmission system expansion \nneeds, thereby saving public funds and increasing returns on energy infrastructure investments that could, in return, \nbe directed towards social programs. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? \n ", " 8  Appendix 2 \nThe poor are disproportionately burdened by the unreliable and insufficient supply of energy resulting from inefficient \nuse of energy resources. Compared to non-poor households, they are (i) less able to resort to alternative sources of \npower, and (ii) less diversified in income sources. The loss of an income source has a greater impact on a poor \nhousehold. On the other hand, access to a reliable power supply can attract commercial and micro-industrial activities, \nwhich in turn may enable the poor to diversify income sources through the increased availability of employment \nopportunities. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nAccess to power supply is also expected to improve households\u2019 living standards and give them new opportunities to \ngenerate income. Positive impacts are also expected in health, especially for women, following the shift from fuel to \non-grid sources of electricity. Finally, a more reliable and secure supply of energy can drastically improve the quality of \nsanitation; health care; and other social services, particularly education. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \n \nAlthough electrification and electricity consumption are not meant be considered outcomes, they are considered \nfundamental inputs for poverty reduction and economic growth. Consumption patterns are skewed in terms of non-\npoor and poor consumers, as electricity consumption by the poor tends to be determined by affordability of appliances. \nDespite these patterns, the high connection ratios across most provinces suggest that capital investments in the \npower sector are inclusive of the poor in two ways: (i) directly as consumers and (ii) indirectly through the creation of \noff-farm employment opportunities in the private sector and economic growth.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \nVarious government and nongovernment agencies, institutions, and companies relevant to energy policy, legislation, \nplanning, management, and implementation will be involved in the development of the energy efficiency program.  \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g. \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \nInitial consultations with these stakeholders have been conducted under the Phase II of ADB\u2019s Energy Efficiency \nInitiative. The TA will conduct further consultation based on the findings from the above consultations.  \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment7 \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nPublic awareness-building is a critical part of the energy efficiency program, thus consultations with stakeholder will be \ndone at each stages of the design as well as implementation of the proposed program. \n  \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nGiven the particular social and economic condition of women in the Pakistani society, gender will be carefully taken \ninto account in undertaking participatory activities. Findings will be included in the project design. \n \n2.    Does  the  proposed  project/program  have  the  potential  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision-making?       Yes          No    Please explain.  \nThe proposed program targets the entire population, and will increase the access and quality of energy services which \nwill result in higher personal savings from lower energy bills.  \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?        \n          Yes          No    Please explain  \nNo adverse impacts are expected from the proposed program.  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2  9\n \nIII.

Background  \n1.  The Government of Pakistan is developing a comprehensive energy efficiency strategy \nthrough  incorporating  energy  efficiency 1 and  energy  conservation 2  into  mainstream  policy, \nregulatory, institutional, and market frameworks. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing \na technical assistance (TA) to the Government to design a suitable sector development program \nproposal that supports the Government efforts to (i) establish an enabling policy and business \nenvironment for energy efficiency and (ii) provide immediate financing of priority projects. \n \n2.  In close cooperation with the relevant stakeholders in energy efficiency and under the \nguidance of the Energy Wing of the Planning Commission of Pakistan (the Executing Agency [EA]), \nthe TA will aim to (i) develop coherent strategy and action guidelines for initiating a sustainable \nlong-term national energy efficiency program; (ii) design activities leading to the development of a \nfull-scale,  national  energy  efficiency  program;  and  (iii)  achieve  immediate  energy  efficiency \nimprovements by implementing no- or low-cost actions, fiscal measures, and policy directions, and \nby removing obvious anomalies and impediments in this respect to the extent possible. \n \nB.  Inputs \n3.  An  international  firm  will  be  engaged  for  this  TA.  The  consulting  firm  will  organize  a \nmultidisciplinary team of experts composed of international and domestic consultants to perform \nthe TA assignment. The consulting firm will be responsible for the quality and timely delivery of the \nentire assignment to meet the stated objective and output requirements. It is expected that this \nassignment would require 14 person-months of international consultants\u2019 input and 25 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants\u2019 input. The terms of reference of the consulting firm is described \nbelow pertaining to each component of the TA. \nC.  Terms of Reference \n1.  General  \n4.  The consulting firm will conduct and prepare (i) an in-depth energy efficiency market and \neconomic assessment; (ii) awareness building for energy efficiency through short-term policy and \nregulatory  improvement  recommendations,  as  well  as  developing  targeted  public  relations \nprograms; (iii) strategy and action guidelines for initiating a sustainable, long-term national energy-\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Report of the Energy Efficiency Initiative. Manila. \u201cEnergy efficiency is defined as economic investments in \nenergy generation, delivery and end-use equipment, facilities, buildings, and infrastructure that deliver higher useful \nenergy outputs or services (e.g., lighting, heating, refrigeration, pumped water). Energy efficiency results in (i) lower \nconsumption of energy, measured as energy input per unit of delivered output or service, and (ii) reduced emissions of \ngreenhouse gases.\u201d \n2  In Pakistan, the term \"energy conservation\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \"energy efficiency\". The \ndefinition of energy efficiency in this terms of reference covers many diverse and distinct market segments, both on the \nsupply side and the demand side, all targeting the creation of a low-carbon, sustainable energy future. Market \nsegments include: supply-side efficiency in generation, transmission, and distribution; grid-connected and off-grid \nrenewable energy; industrial energy efficiency, including changes in production technology; building end-use efficiency \nin the commercial, governmental, and residential sectors; municipal infrastructure (street lighting, water, waste, and \nsewage); transport efficiency, including urban mass transit; biofuel use to substitute for fossil fuels; irrigation (e.g., \nefficient pumps, foot valves and piping); and equipment and appliance standards. As such, for the purpose of clarity, \nthe term energy efficiency is used. \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \n \n \nefficiency program; (iv) a road map for implementing the national energy efficiency program with \ncorresponding investment plans; and (v) identification and design of bankable investment projects. \n \na.  Energy Efficiency Market Assessment \n5.  The energy efficiency market assessment will consist of a detailed analysis of market \npotential and barriers, program design, resource (institutional, technical, manpower, material, and \nfinancial)  evaluation,  and  effective  organizational  needs  assessment  for  undertaking  phased, \nprioritized  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  interventions  in  all  macroeconomic  sectors  and \ninvolving all stakeholder organizations as well as individual end-user interests (including those of \nthe energy-poor and marginalized population segments). The consulting firm will conduct the \nmarket and economic assessment in accordance with a methodology agreed with the EA and \nADB. The consultant will be required to conduct baseline data surveys. All survey-related data and \nmaterials will be turned over to ADB after completion. \n \nb.  Short-Term Policy Recommendations and Awareness-Building \n6.  The consulting firm will further develop recommendations for removing the institutional \nbottlenecks to government-sponsored energy efficiency and conservation programs and support \nmechanisms playing a more effective role in nurturing a nascent energy efficiency industry and \nconsumer culture. \n \n7.  The consulting firm will help the Government to identify and rectify existing policy and \nregulatory  anomalies  or  provisions  impeding  energy  efficiency  and  energy  conservation \nimplementation. These anomalies may include import duties and sales taxes on energy efficiency \nequipment (e.g. compact fluorescent lamps, light emitting diodes, high-pressure sodium and metal \nhalide lighting, variable speed drives, cogeneration systems, power factor correction capacitors, \ncompressed natural gas conversion kits, computerized engine diagnostic and tune-up equipment, \nenergy control and management devices, thermal insulation materials, and renewable energy \nequipment, etc.) and possible surcharges on trade in inefficient items (e.g. incandescent lamps, \nused and reconditioned vehicles and machinery, etc.). \n \n8.  The consulting firm will assist the Government in building leadership and commitment by \ninitiating mandatory public-sector energy efficiency practices in acquiring, constructing, and using \nnew assets where possible (e.g. roof insulation, compact fluorescent lamp replacement, vehicle \nfleet tune-up and conversion, thermostat set points, etc.) with appropriate budgetary allocations for \nestimated annual compliance costs. \n \nc.  Energy Efficiency Program Development Guidelines \n9.  The Government is looking to develop and implement a phased strategy for undertaking a \nsystematic, broad-based national energy efficiency program. This would allow for a revival and \nenhancement of existing energy efficiency capability in the country in the short and medium terms \nin a sustainable manner, while consolidating and expanding them in the medium to long term. \nSuch a phased approach would call for a series of sequential and/or overlapping actions that could \nultimately be mutually reinforcing and will require unwavering support from the Government and \nthe donor community. \n \n10.  Based on past national and international experience, the consulting firm will prepare a set \nof  comprehensive  guidelines  for  the  Government  to  develop  the  national  energy  efficiency \nprogram. The guidelines will recommend methods and approaches to undertake the following: \n ", "Appendix 4  13 \n \n \n(i) conduct  an  economic  and  comparative  benefit-cost  analysis  of  key  energy  efficiency \ninvestments in major energy-consuming sectors (industry, buildings, transportation, agriculture, \ncommercial,  and  residential);  (ii)  prioritize  focus  areas,  and  develop  realizable  quantitative \nimplementation  targets  and  schedules;  (iii)  define  verifiable  energy  efficiency  indicators  and \nperformance monitoring methods; (iv) study energy pricing reforms to highlight tariff and price \ndistortions  and  disincentives  for  energy  efficiency;  and  (v)  evaluate  and  refine  appropriate \ntax/subsidy, tariffs, structures, and price-based incentives and penalties (time-of-day tariffs, power \nfactor penalties, smart subsidies, system benefit charges, rate-basing, shared savings, road use \ncharges, etc.) for inducing improved energy supply and use practices. \n \nd.  Roadmap and Investment Plan for Energy Efficiency Development \n11.  As part of the Government\u2019s commitment to a national energy efficiency program, the \nGovernment is looking to adopt a roadmap for implementing the energy efficiency program. After \nthe  in-depth  assessment  of  the  energy  efficiency  market,  the  consulting  firm  will  identify  the \npotential commercial and economic drivers for energy efficiency, which will be further developed \nand  implemented  under  the  energy  efficiency  program.  The  consulting  firm  will  develop  an \ninvestment plan corresponding to the roadmap and devise suitable options and mechanisms for \nfinancing energy efficiency projects in Pakistan. \n \ne.  Investment Project Proposal \n12.  Given the estimated large potential for energy efficiency improvements in Pakistan, several \nopportunities  exist  that  can  be  readily  tapped  into\u2014without  the  need  for  extensive  precursor \npreparations, detailed policy design, or framework development\u2014for achieving immediate payback \nin terms of energy savings and deferred additional supply requirements. Further refinement and \nexpansion of such options could result in a portfolio of immediate, bankable energy efficiency \ninvestment options for Pakistan that may be considered by the Government, ADB, and other \nfinancing agencies. \n \n13.  Some of these options have been identified in the report Implementing Energy Efficiency in \nPakistan3 completed under ADB\u2019s Energy Efficiency Initiative Phase II. The consulting firm will \nfurther investigate these investment project opportunities and assist the Government in developing \nspecific project proposals for ADB public-sector financing. The consulting firm will (i) recommend \nan appropriate transaction structure and specific funds flow and disbursement mechanism for the \ninvestment project; (ii) evaluate the executing and implementation agency\u2019s capacity for managing \nthe  fund  based  on  such  fund  flow  and  disbursement  mechanism;  (iii)  conduct  a  financial \nmanagement assessment of the executing/implementing agencies; and (iv) evaluate the identified \nprojects for technical, economic, and financial viability in accordance with ADB guidelines and \nnational and ADB safeguard policies.  \n \n2.
