", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Program  was  initiated  in  1992  to  facilitate \nsustainable economic growth and to improve the living standards of the people of the GMS, \nwhich consists of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, \nand Yunnan Province of the People\u2019s Republic of China. At the Tenth and Eleventh Ministerial \nConferences on Subregional Economic Cooperation held in Yangon (27-29 November 2001) \nand Phnom Penh (23-25 September 2002), the Ministers agreed on the need for a common \nstrategic environmental framework for protecting the environment and ensuring community \ninterests,  expressed  their  appreciation  for  the  first  phase  of  the  Strategic  Environment \nFramework (SEF),1 and endorsed the recommended second phase.  \n \n2.  During the Eighth Meeting of the GMS Working Group on Environment in April 2002, the \ncountry representatives recognized the importance  of developing environmental performance \nreview systems at the national and subregional levels in order to incorporate environmental \nconsiderations in national development policies and economic plans and to incorporate the \nresults of national analyses in the SEF to further strengthen its dynamic utility. Thus the \nrepresentatives  unanimously  supported  the  overall  concept  of  the  proposal  on  \u201cNational \nPerformance Assessment and Subregional Strategic Environment Framework\u201d as the follow-on \nproject to the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed SEF.2 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  GMS countries have undertaken programs intended to lessen the degradation of the \nenvironment and natural resources, in particular to counteract deforestation and urban pollution, \nand  to  support  sustainable  development,  including  efforts  to  promote  integration  of \nenvironmental  concerns  into  economic  and  social  decision  making.  Like most developing \ncountries, the GMS countries have limited institutional capacity or information on environmental \nquality and trends to support such strategic planning. To enable informed development decision \nmaking, it is essential to establish an effective performance assessment system supported by \ntimely information using reliable environmental indicators. \n \n4.  The GMS comprises approximately 250 million people with an overall  gross domestic \nproduct of about $190 billion. GMS countries are home to various ethnic minority groups, many \nof whose territories span national boundaries. The GMS has a rich and diverse natural resource \nbase, which has historically supported economic development and sustained rural livelihoods. In \nrecent years, these natural resources have come under increasing stress from the combined \neffects of rapid demographic and economic change, unsustainable exploitation, the impact of \ndevelopment programs and projects, and the relative weakness of protective and regulatory \ninstitutions.  \n \n5.  In 1992, the GMS countries entered into a program of economic cooperation with the \nassistance of ADB. The GMS partners recognized at the outset the potential of development \nprojects  for  adverse  social  and  environmental  effects.  Many  of  the  adverse  impacts  are \navoidable through proper planning, suitable mitigation actions, and ancillary policies. A number \nof mechanisms are in place within the countries to integrate environmental and social concerns \ninto  the  development  process,  and  thus  provide  guidance  towards  project  selection  and \nmodification as well as the needed ancillary policies.  However, experience at the level of \nprojects as well as ecosystems and communities indicate that these safeguards are far from \neffective  and  that  the  difficult  environmental  problems  and  their  solutions  cross  national \n                                                 \n1  ADB 1998. Strategic Environmental Framework for the GMS. Manila.  \n2  The proposed TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities on 27 June 2002. ", "2       \nboundaries. Some of these deviations are the result of persistent gaps in knowledge, capacities, \nand institutions, which lead to inadequate decisions and implementation arrangements. This \nsuggests  the  need  for  a  dynamic  regional  strategic  environmental  framework,  built  on \nassessments of national environmental performance in meeting environmental objectives.  \n \n6.  The  SEF  project  is  a  combination  of  analytical,  participatory,  and  policy-oriented \nprocesses that together constitute a strategic platform for guiding investment decisions in the \nGMS. The first phase of the SEF was to propose a strategic platform to guide investment \ndecisions in the infrastructure sectors in the GMS with the aim of making such investments \ncompatible with the demands of environmental and social sustainability. The outputs of the first \nphase have included (i) a set of databases, general purpose software, and methodologies \ndesigned to support decision making on infrastructure investments in the GMS; (ii) a number of \nanalytical methodologies, including the identification and analysis of hotspots, review of case \nstudy projects at various stages of implementation, and framing of different scenarios for the \ndevelopment of the subregion; and (iii) a set of goals for sustainable human development in the \nregion. The SEF software and databases are available and relevant for decision making by ADB \nand the GMS countries. In particular, they can assist national level policy makers in formulating \nbetter development plans and analyzing and assessing their potential impacts; private sector \nentities in designing more sustainable infrastructure projects; nongovernment organizations and \nlocal communities in accessing information needed for more effective participation in national \nand regional decision making; and regional associations and intergovernmental organizations \n(e.g., ADB, the Mekong River Commission, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) in \ndeveloping better integrated regional plans, providing more effective oversight and assessment, \nand supporting more informed regional agreements. The main recommendation of the first \nphase of the SEF is to maintain and refine the SEF system, which includes further data \ncollection, the refinement of guidance on procedures and methodologies, and training in and \ndissemination of the developed methodologies.    \n \n7.  Studies of environmental disasters and long-term regional environmental changes have \nconsistently found that the overwhelming proportion of ecological damage and human loss is \nhighly  concentrated  in  vulnerable  ecosystems  and  communities,  especially  ethnic  minority \ncommunities. Therefore, identifying the regions and peoples at greatest risk from human-\ninduced  changes  and  natural  variation,  and  assessing  the  sources  and  causes  of  their \nvulnerability,  will  help  promote  more  sustainable  development.  Accordingly,  the  hotspot \napproach was carried out by the first phase of the SEF through five identified priority hotspots in \nthe GMS. However, as one of the rich and diverse natural resource bases in the world, the \ngrowth  of  trade  and  investment  flows  and  the  accelerating  development  of  energy  and \ntransportation resources in the GMS have led to the characterization of the entire subregion as \nthe new frontier of Asian economic growth. Thus, it is obvious that the development of the SEF \nneeds to be expanded beyond hotspots to the entire subregion. Based on the recommendations \nand lessons learned from the first phase of the SEF, the second phase will be aimed at \nfacilitating  decision  making,  first,  by  creating  a  data  warehouse,  which  will  structure  and \norganize the relevant data and information in the national and subregional levels in order to \nmake it readily accessible to decision makers; second, by providing performance assessment \nmethodologies;  and  third,  by  establishing  a  framework  and  platform  through  which  new \nknowledge will constantly be added to the existing databases.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The goal of the technical assistance (TA) is to promote sustainable development in the \nGMS through the creation of national and subregional environmental performance assessment \nsystems in the GMS countries, and development of national and subregional capacities for \nimplementing this assessment. The primary purposes of the TA are to facilitate at the national \nand  subregional  levels  (i)  informed  decision  making  through  better  understanding  of \nenvironmental conditions, trends, and impacts; (ii) effective and efficient national environmental \nprogram management and improved public accountability for results;  and (iii) reporting of \nnational, subregional, and international environmental information and performance assessment \non environmental issues of regional and global importance. The TA will also facilitate analysis of \nthe development effectiveness and performance-based  lending  criteria  of  aid organizations \nthrough the creation of   systems on environmental indicators and performance assessments \nand the development of local capacity for carrying out the performance assessments. The \nframework summarizing the objectives, goals, scope, inputs, outputs, and performance targets \nof the TA is given in Appendix 1.   \n      \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  Activity 1. Development of prototypes of (i) a set of core indicators, (ii) a database, and \n(iii) technical guidelines. A generic set of core indicators and prototype environmental database \nfor the GMS countries will be prepared to support the performance assessments for sustainable \ndevelopment  and  global  environmental  protection.  Technical  guidelines,  supported  as \nappropriate by a set of models, will be prepared for performance assessments and integration of \nenvironmental concerns into economic and social policies. These will be used as baselines to \nbe refined for specific purposes during implementation of the individual country-specific and \nsubregional activities. In parallel with the preparation of these tools, technical training in the use \nof the guidelines will be conducted for GMS staff ultimately responsible for the information \ncollection and analysis.  \n \n10.  Activity  2.  Country-specific  activities  will  include  (i)  needs  assessments  and  gap \nanalyses;  (ii)  development  of  indicators,  computer  models,  and  databases;  and  (iii) \nestablishment of national performance assessment systems and implementation of the national \nassessments. Country-specific needs assessment and gap analysis will be conducted in each \nparticipating country to identify essential institutional, technical, and human development needs, \ntaking into account the technical guidelines. Country-specific indicators, computer models, and \ndatabases will be prepared in consideration of country-specific priorities. Based on these, \ncountry-specific performance assessment systems will be developed, and national performance \nassessments will be implemented in each participating country.  \n \n11.  Activity 3. Subregional-specific activities will include (i) needs assessment and gap \nanalysis; (ii) development of indicators, computer models, and database; and (iii) establishment \nof a performance assessment system and implementation of the  SEF. Subregional needs \nassessment and gap analysis will be conducted taking into account the technical guidelines. \nSubregional indicators, computer models, and the database will be prepared in consideration of \nsubregional priorities. Based on these, a subregional performance assessment system will be \ndeveloped, and subregional performance assessment will be implemented.  \n \n12.  The activities will constitute the  SEF, for enabling and guiding the  harmonization of \npolicy, legal, and administrative frameworks; and coordination of investment programs and \ndevelopment plans. Given that the purview of this framework is subregional or supranational, its \n ", "4       \nfocus is on the range of investments and decisions that  will have a cross-boundary impact, \neither  because  they  are  located  in  more  than  one  country  or  because  their  social, \nenvironmental, demographic, or economic impacts extend beyond national boundaries. Many \nadverse impacts of development projects could be avoided by using better and more informed \nproject preparation and selection methods.  \n \n13.  Building on the above tasks, the SEF will further include (i) the development of a user-\nfriendly  and  menu-driven  general  purpose software package  that  offers  decision  makers \ndecision  support  tools  and  information  to  help  them  assess  the  complex  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  of  projects  and  programs; (ii)  identification  and  promotion  of  such \nprocedures, policies, and actions to ensure cumulative environmental assessments, sharing of \ninformation, inventories of plans and projects, and analysis of alternatives; (iii) development as \nan integral component of the SEF platform, through a regional consultative process of a set of \ngoals for sustainable human development in the region; and (iv) conversion of such goals into \nregion-specific  planning  assumptions,  institution-specific  decision  guidelines,  and  explicit \nrecommendations to governments and aid agencies in the form of strategic interventions.   \n \n14.  Activity 4. Dissemination of outcomes will focus on the set of continuous performance \nassessment  indicators,  computer  models,  databases,  and  model  performance  assessment \nsystems at the national and subregional levels. To share lessons learned through the projects, \nsubregional as well as regional workshops will be held. Possible follow-up actions are to be \ndiscussed, and expansion of similar activities to other countries in the region will be considered. \nThe outcomes of the TA will also be disseminated globally as a good practice, by taking \nadvantage of various international forums and through the Internet.    \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n \n15.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $2.4  million.  ADB  will  provide  $800,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. The Global Environment Facility \nwill provide $800,000 of cofinancing on a grant basis.3 Additional funding of $500,000 will be \nprovided and administered by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) ($200,000) \nand  the  Institute  for  Global  Environmental  Strategies/National  Institute  for  Environmental \nStudies (IGES/NIES) ($300,000). The six GMS governments will make in-kind contributions in \nthe form of office space, local travel, remuneration of counterpart professional and support staff, \ncost of data acquisition, office facilities and utilities, use of available equipment and all data. \nThese contributions are estimated at $300,000 equivalent in total. Detailed cost estimates are \npresented in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee for the TA will be \nestablished including representatives of the GMS countries, ADB, UNEP, IGES, and NIES, to \nbe chaired by the representative of ADB. Members from the GMS countries will be selected \nfrom national organizations participating in the GMS Working Group on Environment, which also \nwill be the implementing agencies for the TA in each country. Steering committee meetings will \nbe held before important subregional and national activities are undertaken either in actual \nmeetings or through teleconferencing. A project monitoring feedback mechanism and regular \nreporting will facilitate effective implementation of the TA.  \n \n17.  The TA secretariat will be established at the UNEP Regional Research Center (RRC.AP) \nin Bangkok. A full-time TA coordinator will be appointed by UNEP-RRC.AP and financed by \n                                                 \n3  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of GEF endorsed cofinancing of the Project on 26 November 2002. \n ", "  5\nUNEP. Two full-time administrative/research assistants, financed by the ADB grant, will support \nthe coordinator in carrying out day-to-day TA activities. The activities planned require skills in \nindicator and database development and performance assessment as well as experience in the \nregion. Thus, the secretariat will consist of international three consultants to be recruited under \nthe TA, plus experts to be seconded by participating organizations such as IGES on a part-time \nbasis. In the meantime, a national coordinating committee in each participating country and an \nexpert group for the TA will be established to coordinate national activities for the TA as well as \nprovide technical support for implementing it. At least three expert group meetings will be \norganized to review the draft and other findings of the secretariat on the list of draft indicators, \nframework for database and computer modeling, and guidelines for indicator compilation and \nperformance assessment. The meetings will include experts from the selected countries and \nrepresentatives of participating organizations as well as subregional organizations such as the \nMekong River Commission.   \n \n18.  Three international consultants to be recruited under the TA should have expertise in (i) \nintegrated  economic  and  environmental  development  planning,  12  person-months;  (ii) \nenvironmental policy and management, 6 person-months; and (iii) environmental monitoring and \ndatabase, 6 person-months. The local consultants from the GMS countries (12 persons in total: \n2 from each country) will provide a total of 120 person-months of inputs in the areas of \neconomic and environmental development planning, environmental policy and management, \nand environmental monitoring and database. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Consultants will be recruited as individuals or from firms \nand/or institutions. Office space and basic office equipment will be provided by UNEP-RRC.AP. \nComputers and software to be used during the TA will be procured by ADB through the TA \nsecretariat in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The terms of reference for \nconsulting services are outlined in Appendix 3.   \n \n19.  The TA will be completed in 3 years, commencing in January 2003 and ending in \nDecember 2005. The inception report will be discussed in an inception workshop in the third \nmonth after mobilization of the TA coordinator. Quarterly progress reports will be prepared by \nthe TA secretariat, published on the RRC.AP web site, and discussed via the Internet. The \ninterim report summarizing the progress and outlining the continuing work will be discussed in a \nthree-day  interim  review  workshop  in  May  and  October  of  2004,  respectively.  The  final \nworkshop to discuss the final report will be held in October 2005. To ensure that the TA will be \nwell implemented, ADB, in consultation with UNEP, will monitor and periodically review the \nprogress of its implementation through (i) quarterly progress reports; (ii) a review workshop held \nevery year with participation from the countries, the steering committee organizations, and other \npotential aid organizations; and (iii) at least three annual review missions, particularly to review \nthe inception, interim, and draft final reports.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000, to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Global Environment Facility; and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis  for the  National  Performance \nAssessment  and  Subregional  Strategic  Environment  Framework  in  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion, and hereby reports this action to the Board.   \n \n ", " \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \nA\np\nDesign Summary  Indicators and Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  p\ne\nn\nGoals        dix\nPinr oGmMoSti othnr oouf gsuhs ctareinaatibolne  odfe nvaetlioopnmale nt  Dimepvleelmopemnteantito, na mofe nnadtmioneanlt  a, nadn d  Pgoovliecryn dmiaelnotgsu aen wd itGh MnSat-iWonGaEl   Ccoounnsterinessu isn  aGnMd Sc otom dmeitvmeleonpt,  oafm  end,    1    \n \nand subregional environmental  subregional plans and programs as    and implement their plans, programs,    \n \n6\nperformance assessment systems in  well as individual projects in line with      and projects based on the   \n \nthe GMS countries, and development  sustainable development  environmental performance   \nof national and subregional capacity  assessment, and they maintain their \nfor implementing the environmental  capacity \nperformance assessment \n \nPurposes       \n1.
