INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) support Nepal\u2019s inclusive and sustainable development with knowledge solutions and \ninstitutional capacity development. The TA will focus on knowledge solutions such as analytical \nand diagnostic studies to inform strategies, plans, and policies; institutional strengthening; and \ncapacity development of government agencies especially at the subnational level. The TA will \nprioritize knowledge dissemination and will help implement the country knowledge plan of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS) for Nepal, 2020\u20132024.1 It will also enable ADB to respond to \nknowledge and institutional strengthening needs arising from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic and other emerging challenges.2  \n \n2.  The TA is closely aligned with the government\u2019s Fifteenth Plan (FY2020\u2013FY2024)3 and \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.4 It is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023.5    \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Nepal\u2019s  economic  growth  averaged  5.3%  during  FY2014\u2013FY2019  and  7.3%  during \nFY2017\u2013FY2019, higher than the average of 4.9% (FY2010-FY2019). In FY2020, the Central \nBureau of Statistics estimates a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 2.3%, reflecting \nthe  adverse  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Hotels  and  restaurants,  manufacturing, \nconstruction, transport, and trade have been particularly adversely affected. With large numbers \nof Nepali migrant workers returning home, remittances (25.4% of GDP in FY2019) have declined. \nThe structural transformation that economies typically undergo as they develop\u2014with a shift from \nagriculture to more productive manufacturing and services\u2014has been gradual.6 Agriculture\u2019s \nshare in GDP declined from 49% in FY1990, but remains large at an estimated 27.6% of GDP in \nFY2020. Likewise, the share of manufacturing has declined from a recent peak of 9.0% of GDP \nin FY1998 to 5.1% in FY2020.7  Much of the growth is attributable to services. The economy is \nlargely informal.8  \n \n4.  Nepal has significant potential for higher production and exports of goods and services \nsuch as hydropower; tourism; high-value agriculture and agro-processing; and manufacturing of \ntextiles,  garments,  and  footwear  (footnote  6).  These  sectors  have  the  potential  to  create \nsubstantially more productive jobs for the young and growing labor force and returning migrant \nworkers. While an increase in public investment is necessary to realize the potential, it is equally \nimportant to improve the quality of such investments. That will entail developing knowledge \nsolutions and stronger public institutions for better planning, management, and design and \nimplementation of projects, programs, and policies; attracting domestic and foreign investment; \n \n1  ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n7  Footnote 6 and Central Bureau of Statistics.  \n8  Among the employed in FY2018, 62.2% were in the informal sector. These informal workers accounted for 94% of \nall workers in agriculture and 53% of all workers in non-agriculture sectors. Informal employment accounted for 84.6% \nof total employment, which includes those employed in the formal sector who do not have access to social security \nbenefits (footnote 6).  \n ", "2 \nand ensuring healthy competition in the private sector so that the country\u2019s scarce resources are \nallocated to more productive activities and used more efficiently.  \n \n5.  The transition to a federal governance system mandated by the 2015 constitution and \ninitiated since the 2017 elections raises the prospects of greater accountability and better delivery \nof public services. The constitution has assigned larger functional, semi-judicial, and fiscal \nmanagement responsibilities to subnational governments (SNGs). The success of federalism \ndepends largely on whether SNGs fulfill their constitutional mandates. Inadequate knowledge \nsolutions and weak institutional capacity are major challenges in the transition to federalism, \nwhich  affect  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  deliver  public  services  efficiently  and  implement \ndevelopment projects and programs. ADB must adapt its operations to the federal governance \nstructure  and  clarify  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  central,  provincial,  and  local \ngovernments.9 \n \n6.  The government\u2019s Fifteenth Plan (FY2020\u2013FY2024) and its long-term strategy expect \nNepal to reach a per capita income of $1,595 by FY2024, meet the Sustainable Development \nGoals by FY2030, and become a high-income country by 2047.10 The plan\u2019s objectives include \nhuman capital development; universal, accessible, and modern infrastructure; higher production \nand  productivity  in  agriculture,  industry,  and  services;  a  healthy  and  balanced  ecosystem, \nincluding resilience to climate change and natural hazards; and good governance. The plan calls \nfor the government to implement smoothly the federal system of governance and create an \ninvestment-friendly  environment  for  the  private  sector.  It  places  critical  importance  on  the \naccumulation of knowledge, skills, technology, and more generally, human and physical capital. \nWith poverty and inequality likely to rise because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and given Nepal\u2019s \nvulnerability to natural hazards, climate change, and environmental degradation, more inclusive \nand greener growth has become even more important. \n \n7.  Drawing on the government\u2019s priorities, ADB\u2019s CPS included three strategic objectives: (i) \nimproved infrastructure for private sector-led growth; (ii) improved access to devolved services; \nand (iii) strengthened environmental sustainability and resilience to climate change and natural \nhazards (footnote 1). ADB\u2019s country knowledge plan  focused on (i) policy advisory services with \ndiagnostic studies and assessments of good practice models, including the feasibility of new \ntechnologies, appropriate for Nepal; (ii) planning and implementation mechanisms for inclusive \nand sustainable delivery of quality infrastructure and social services, especially at the subnational \nlevels; and (iii) capacity development of relevant stakeholders (Appendix 2 of footnote 1). The \nCOVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of health services; social protection; food \nsecurity;  employment  generation  including  in  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises; \nappropriate labor force skills to respond to changing markets; essential infrastructure; efficient \nsupply chain management; and promotion of gender equality and social inclusion (GESI). With \nrestrictions on in-person interactions, the use of digital technology has assumed greater urgency.   \n \n8.  One of the key lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in Nepal is the need to incorporate \nsustainability mechanisms in ADB operations, including disaster-resilient project designs, well-\ncoordinated  policy  and regulatory reforms,  institutional capacity  development,  and  effective \ncommunication  and  coordination  during  project  design  and  implementation  (footnote  9). \nRecommendations  include  an  increased  focus  on  institutional  strengthening,  capacity \ndevelopment, and governance reform, including support to key intergovernmental subsystems to \nfacilitate the transition to the federal system. ADB needs to buttress its support for knowledge, in \n \n9  ADB. 2018. Country Partnership Final Review: Nepal, 2013\u2013mid-2018. Manila. \n10  The long-term strategy targets per capita GDP of $12,100 by 2047.  \n ", " \n3 \naddition to finance, by communicating more effectively what it does and what it can do to help \nachieve the country\u2019s development objectives.11 At the corporate level, ADB should substantially \nenhance the scope of knowledge contribution to add to development finance in the future, thereby \ndeepening ADB\u2019s continuous transformation.12 \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s  TA  in  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  government  and  providing \nknowledge solutions is timely and important given the capacity and knowledge gaps in (a) \nimplementing policy and institutional reforms, (b) designing high-impact projects and programs, \n(c) planning and resource allocation, (d) making quality investments, (e) delivering public services \nefficiently under the federal system of governance, and (f) addressing medium-term challenges \nlikely to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: knowledge, skills, technology, and human and \nphysical capital enhanced (footnote 3). The TA will have the following outcome: Design and \nimplementation of development policies, strategies, programs, and projects improved. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Knowledge solutions produced and events organized for inclusive and \nsustainable development. The TA will support the generation and dissemination of knowledge \nproducts covering various sectors and themes, as well as knowledge events. The TA will support \nanalytical, diagnostic, and feasibility studies, including with surveys, based on their alignment with \nthe ongoing or planned government and/or ADB initiatives.13 Policy reform strategies, plans, and \npolicy briefs will be prepared based on the findings of these studies. Lessons from past operations \nwill be drawn through case studies and used in the design of projects and for policy and \ninstitutional  reforms.  GESI  aspects  will  be  considered  in  the  knowledge  products  when \nappropriate. Knowledge sharing events will be organized to share findings from these studies and \nplans. Interactive forums and seminars on other development and policy issues relevant to Nepal \nwill also be organized.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Policies, strategies, and plans to improve institutional capacity of public \ninstitutions  prepared.  The  TA  will  support  capacity  development  of  public  institutions, \nparticularly at the SNG level. This will include support for (i) preparing acts, regulations, and \npolicies that incorporate gender and climate change-related features when feasible; (ii) setting up \ninstitutional structures;14 reporting mechanisms; and operational systems, including the use of \ndigital technology (para. 13); and (iii) developing strategies and plans to improve local economic \ndevelopment and employment generation by focusing on areas such as domestic resource \nmobilization;  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprise  development;  and  public\u2013private \npartnerships.  \n \n11 ADB. 2019.

The TA will support at least one SNG institution\u2019s efforts to install digital technologies, \nsuch  as  a  facility  for  video  conferencing,  and  to  automate  its  administrative  and  financial \nmanagement system to help it function effectively and deliver public services even during crises \nsuch as the COVID-19 pandemic.15 Where necessary, the TA will also support institutional \nassessments and preparation of institutional strengthening plans for select government agencies \nin relation to their specific development operations or their mandates. This support could include \nassessing a provincial government\u2019s capacity for disaster risk management or crisis management \nfor events such as COVID-19, and developing a plan to manage such risks. Support will also be \nprovided to prepare communication strategies that will improve coordination among government \nagencies at different tiers.  \n \n14.  Output  3:  Skills,  capacity,  and  knowledge  of  government  officials  and  other \nstakeholders enhanced.16 The TA will support capacity development through selected training \nprograms.  While ADB is delivering training related mainly to project implementation through the \nCapacity Development Resource Center at the Nepal Administrative Staff College,17 this TA will \nprovide training in other functional areas at all tiers of government. Training programs in specific \nareas and for particular skills will be determined by the institutional strengthening plans of the \ngovernment agencies (para. 13), and as requested by the government. This will include tailor-\nmade executive programs for senior government officials to enhance leadership and management \nskills.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The International Economic Cooperation Coordination Division (IECCD) of the Ministry of \nFinance will be the executing agency of the TA. The resident mission will administer the TA in \nclose coordination with government agencies, development partners, and other ADB-funded \nprograms, projects, and TA to ensure complementarity and avoid duplication.  \n \n17.  The  implementation  period  will  be  5  years  from  the  date  of  TA  approval.  The \nimplementation of the TA will be guided by a TA advisory committee, which will be formed under \nthe leadership of the resident mission country director (as knowledge custodian). Heads of \nresident mission programs and portfolio units, the knowledge focal person, and external relations \nofficer will be the committee members. The resident mission knowledge focal person (currently \nthe senior programs officer) will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the TA.  \n \n18.  Resident mission staff will support government counterparts in preparing and submitting \nproposals for TA support. The list of proposals received by ADB will be shared with the IECCD \nfor  feedback.  The  proposals  will  be  discussed  at  TA  advisory  committee  meetings.  Such \n \n15  Training and an operational manual will be provided. This could be replicated in other local governments. \n16  Other stakeholders could include communities and civil society organizations, especially at the subnational levels. \n17  The Capacity Development Resource Center is funded by ADB.
