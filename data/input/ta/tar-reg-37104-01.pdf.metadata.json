In 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved its Social Protection Strategy. \nCurrently, ADB is preparing steps to implement the strategy by including social protection \nprojects  and  programs  in  the  country  strategy  programs  of  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs).    Given  the  pivotal  role  of  a  Social  Protection  Index  (SPI)  in  monitoring  poverty \nreduction, ADB endorsed in December 2002 a concept paper to develop an SPI which was \nendorsed for funding by the (i) Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund (PRF) by the Department \nof International Development of the Government of the United Kingdom, and (ii) Cooperation \nFund  in  Support  of  the  Formulation  and  Implementation  of  National  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategies by the Netherlands. ADB also decided to pilot test the SPI in a regional technical \nassistance1 (TA) in six countries (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Viet Nam). \nThe Governments of the six countries have agreed to participate in the pilot test. Currently, ADB \nis preparing or carrying out social protection studies in several countries (Indonesia, People's \nDemocratic Republic of Lao, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea) and a regional TA is being \nprepared to assess social protection systems in Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, and \nVanuatu. The findings of the studies will support the development of the methodology of the \nSPI. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Social protection is defined as the set of policies and programs designed to reduce \npoverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labor markets, diminishing people's exposure to \nrisks, and enhancing their capacity to protect themselves against hazards and interruption/loss \nof income. Social protection is moving higher on the agenda of many international, bilateral and \nnational institutions and governments. Due to the shock of the Asian Crisis and to ensure that \neconomic growth in DMCs benefits the poor, social protection is needed as an element of pro-\npoor growth.  \n \n3.  Nearly all DMCs have social protection schemes. However, a large part of the funds \ndedicated  to  social  protection  is  vested  in  formal  social  insurance  schemes,  mostly  for \ngovernment officials. Social protection measures are also targeted to the poor, e.g. programs for \nthe elderly, the disabled, orphans, disaster relief, food for work, social funds, public health care \nprovider networks, and micro-insurance schemes. Social protection schemes include formal and \ninformal  sector  social  protection,  financed  through  government  budget,  contributions  from \nindividuals, the private sector, nongovernment organizations, and development partners. Also, \nsocial protection concepts vary greatly among DMCs. \n \n4.  So far, little has been done to measure quantitative dimensions of all the areas of social \nprotection (para 3). Reliable data are generally unavailable, but are a prerequisite for effective \nplanning and monitoring of social protection measures. Most available data pertain to public \nbudget items (though not always in a disaggregated and target-oriented format) and to formal \nsocial protection schemes like pension schemes for public servants and large private sector \nenterprises. The International Labour Organization has done important work in compiling and \nanalyzing  formal  social  protection  data  through  their  social  budgeting  model.  Hardly  any \naggregate quantitative information is available on other private sector activities, NGO activities, \ndevelopment partner contributions, and the large informal sector, which has an important role in \nsocial protection in all DMCs.   \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 12 February 2003. ", "2   \n5.  Thus, to implement the ADB Social Protection Strategy, various questions arise:  \n(i)  How should social protection be defined in each DMC? Social protection policies, \nmechanisms,  and  instruments  vary  from  one  country  to  another  owing  to \ndifferences in needs, available resources, and priorities.  \n(ii)  What is the situation in DMCs concerning social protection? Which tools are \napplied? What are the resources dedicated to social protection? Who is covered? \nWhat is the experience in poverty reduction and prevention?  \n(iii)  How can the implementation of the Social Protection Strategy be monitored? \n \n6.  There are different ways to address these questions.  One basic requirement is to \nimprove the data situation. Information has to be collected, compiled, adapted, and analyzed \nwith view to social protection needs. Data that are not in the required format have to be \nestimated based on related sources, e.g., surveys. \n \n7.  An SPI could be used to (i) to measure the situation and progress made in terms of \nsocial protection (ii) measure developments, and (iii) compare countries' efforts to reduce \npoverty  through  social  protection.  One  of  the  best  known  indexes  in  the  field  of  social \ndevelopment is the human development index (HDI) computed by United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP). The HDI is based on three indicators: life expectancy at birth; knowledge \nmeasured by adult literacy rate; gross primary, secondary, and tertiary enrolment; and standard \nof living measured by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The HDI is calculated for every \ncountry  based  on  the  same  methodology,  thus  making  cross-country  comparisons  and \ncomparisons in time possible. An index can also be useful for analyzing and improving data, \nwhich itself is an important step toward transparency and monitoring. \n \n8.  In  the  field  of  social  protection,  a  few  indicators  are  commonly  used  (e.g.,  social \nexpenditure as a share of GDP based on a social budget, coverage rate for formal and \nnonformal social insurance schemes, and poverty indicators), but no composite index is broadly \naccepted.  \n \n9.  An SPI could be used to compare countries and for benchmarking, taking into account a \nwhole set of circumstances like economic performance, size of the social problems the country \nfaces, and achievements. Countries with low incomes could be compared in their efforts with \ncountries with higher incomes. This might show no direct correlation between the level of social \nprotection efforts and the economic performance of a country, and that countries with low \nincomes make relatively greater efforts in social protection than countries with higher incomes. \n \n10.  Developing an SPI will also help to define social protection (including instruments like \nsubsidies for the poor, informal sector schemes, traditional and community-based mechanisms, \nand social welfare), taking into account the different concepts of social protection in each DMC. \nCountry preferences are also influenced by the political support and social consensus needed to \nimplement reforms. According to the ADB Social Protection Strategy, formal education and \nmacroeconomic labor market issues, for example, are not regarded as part of social protection. \n \n11.  The SPI will be based on quantitative data and will be accompanied by a qualitative \nassessment of social protection instruments and policies through social protection studies \n(reports).  The reports will link the quantitative and qualitative work by interpreting results of both \nand giving background information on the situation of social protection in each DMC. \n ", "    3\n12.  The SPI will be simple and transparent so that regular compilation is easy for the \nstatistical offices of DMCs and to make it readily understandable. The index could, for example, \nincorporate all or some of the following elements: \n \n(i)  affordability: the total funds spent for formal and nonformal social protection (e.g., \nfrom the social budget, public expenditure reviews, etc.) in relation to GDP per \ncapita; \n(ii)  coverage: percent of population covered (members and beneficiaries of social \ninsurance,  beneficiaries  of  social  assistance,  beneficiaries  of  non-formal \nprotection schemes);  \n(iii)  equity: distribution of social protection benefits among target groups; and \n(iv)  adequacy: poverty level (share of population to be regarded as below the poverty \nline); this indicator would reflect the need for social protection measures, and \ncould,  for  example,  use  delivery  of  social  protection  benefits  according  to \nquintiles of income. \n \n13.  The preliminary examples should be evaluated and/or refined by the proposed study, \nespecially considering existing data. At least three alternatives should be discussed. Alternative \nindicators could be taken into account like vulnerability, availability of instruments, resource \nallocation, and targeting. The SPI for all DMCs should be computed by the same methodology, \nallowing comparisons between countries and our time. \n \n14.  The availability of data may be a major problem for the development of the index. This \ncan be handled in several ways. \n \n(i)  In areas such as formal social protection schemes, public expenditure, and GDP \nper capita, data will be available at the government level. \n(ii)  In other areas, like distribution of income and benefits, survey data may be used. \n(iii)  In some areas, stakeholders must be asked, data must be indirectly generated, \nextrapolations will have to be made. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n15.  The goal of devising the SPI is to help reduce poverty by supporting social protection in \nthe DMCs. The objectives are to  \n \n(i)  define social protection for each DMC involved and develop a common standard \nregarding  what  is  part  of  social  protection  (important  in  order  to  ensure \ncomparability among DMCs), \n(ii)  improve  statistical  information  on  social  protection  (for  monitoring  of  social \nprotection strategy impacts), and \n(iii)  allow comparisons between countries and over time with view to implementation \nof social protection measures. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will have four components. \n ", "4   \n17.  Component  1,  Methodology.  In  a  first  step,  a  preliminary  methodology  will  be \nelaborated (indicators included, social protection defined, alternative formulas described, and \nstatistical basis determined). Existing ADB and other accessible data bases, country reports, \nlimitations concerning availability and viability of data, and other factors should be analyzed  for \ntheir relevancy to the index. This component will have a preparatory phase and a phase that \noverlaps in time with component 2. \n \n18.  Component 2, Field Work. Pilot fieldwork will be done in one of the TA DMCs. Based \non the methodology discussed, information will be collected and the index will be computed to \ndetermine the validity of the output. Amendments to the methodology might be necessary. \nBased on the experience in the pilot country, guidelines will be elaborated for local consultants \nto collect information and data in the remaining TA countries. A workshop (the TA workshop) \nwith all the local consultants from the RETA countries will provide an opportunity to (i) discuss \nthe results; (ii) ascertain feedback on methodology, guidelines, and data situation; and (iii) \nprovide guidance for the additional work to be done. Local workshops in each of the RETA \ncountries will be held in the DMCs in order to discuss the statistical data and methodology used \nwith stakeholders will be held. The index will be calculated for all TA DMCs based on the work \ndone by the local consultants. \n \n19.  Component 3, Policy. After this, the results have to be interpreted in single- and multi-\ncountry reports analyzing and interpreting the findings derived from the index and the analysis \nof the social protection arrangements. Differences in social protection concepts should be \nhighlighted. A conference with government representatives (preferably from statistical offices) \nfrom the TA DMCs will discuss conclusions from the index and from the country reports and will \nreceive inputs concerning the practical implementation of the index. \n \n20.  Component  4,  Upscaling.  The  index  will  be  shared  and  discussed  with  other \ndevelopment banks and ILO. ILO has expressed interest in being involved in the work on the \nindex. A handbook on the use of the index in Asia will be prepared, taking into account the \nfindings  in  the  TA  DMCs  and  practical  issues  encountered.  A  preliminary  index  will  be \ncalculated for all DMCs based on available data (from internationally available data bases and \ncountry reports). The final report and the handbook will be distributed by ADB to all DMCs in \norder to raise support for developing the index. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $600,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be funded on a grant basis from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund and the Cooperation Fund in Support of the Formulation and Implementation of National \nPoverty Reduction Strategies, each for $300,000 equivalent. The remaining $50,000 equivalent \nwill be contributed by the governments of the pilot countries in kind and will include counterpart \nstaff remuneration and workshop venue. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are \nshown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The TA will be carried out during 18 months, beginning in November 2003 and ending in \nMarch  2005.  Consultants'  inputs  will  amount  to  42  person-months:  30  domestic,  and  12 \ninternational. The international consultants (with person-months in parenthesis) will include a \nstatistician  (8)  and  a  social  protection  specialist  (4).  The  domestic  consultants  are  six \nstatisticians (3 each) and six social protection specialists (2 each). All consultants will be ", "    5\nrecruited through a firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging domestic consultants. The simplified technical proposal format will be used. The team \nwill be chaired by the international statistician. \n \n23.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be ADB's, Social Sectors Division, South Asia \nDepartment  in  close  coordination  with  the  Regional  Departments  and  the  Regional  and \nSustainable Development Department. \n \n24.  Component 1. The methodology will be determined by a consulting firm and/or a \nresearch institute hired by ADB, selected in line with ADB guidelines on the use of consultants. \n \n25.  Component 2. The statistical preparation and computation of the index for the TA DMCs \nwill  be  done  by  local  consultants  hired  by  the  consulting  firm.  The  TA  workshop  will  be \norganized by the firm. In this phase, line ministries, statistical offices, and stakeholders of the TA \nDMCs would be involved.  \n \n26.  Component 3. The reports and the conference with government representatives from \nthe TA DMCs will be prepared by the consulting firm. ADB will provide support by inviting the \nparticipants. \n \n27.  Component 4. The consulting firm will manage the discussion of the index with other \ndevelopment banks and ILO, the preparation of the handbook, and the calculation of the \npreliminary index for all DMCs. \n \n28.  The  consultants  will  submit  short  6-monthly  progress  reports  summarizing  project \nactivities, issues, and constraints for the duration of the TA. In addition, four major reports will \nbe submitted: (i) an inception report, including a work plan for the TA, within 3 weeks of TA \ncommencement; (ii) individual country reports, which will be discussed at the TA workshop 8 \nmonths after inception; (iii) a draft final report and the draft handbook, which will be submitted \n17 months after inception; (iv) a final report 4 weeks after comments are received from ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n29.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund and the Cooperation Fund in Support of \nthe Formulation and Implementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies, for the Social \nProtection Index for Committed Poverty Reduction, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  and Risks \nGoal       \n       \nTo reduce poverty by  The Social Protection Index has  Reports, reaction of  DMCs have other priorities \nsupporting social protection  contributed to a broader  participants in the final  and will not participate in \nin the developing member  recognition of the importance of  conference, acceptance of  the Index \ncountries (DMCs)   social protection in Asia  the index in DMCs not \nparticipating in the regional \ntechnical assistance (TA) \n \nObjectives       \n       \n(i) To allow comparisons  Comparison of a number of  Reports, final conference  Availability of data \nbetween countries and in  countries has been made,     \ntime to implement social  applying the Social Protection     \nprotection  Index.     \n       \n(ii) To definite social  Social protection sector has  Reports, final conference  Difficulties in defining which \nprotection as relevant each  been defined in a number of    activities and projects are \nDMC involved.
