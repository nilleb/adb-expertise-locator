During the 2002 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of Indonesia requested technical assistance (TA) to assist the Ministry for \nState-Owned Enterprises (MSOE) to continue implementing the Government\u2019s State-Owned \nEnterprise Reform Program (SOERP).1 The Fact-Finding Mission, fielded from 14- 26 October \n2002, reached an understanding with the Government on the purpose and output, methodology \nand key activities, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements of the TA.2 The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2002 country strategy and program for Indonesia. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Stage one of the 10-year reform program is supported by a three tranche Program Loan \n(State-Owned Enterprise Governance and Privatization Program [SOEGPP]), currently under \nimplementation and expected to be completed on time by July 2004.  Stage one, supported by \ntwo ADB TAs,3 concentrated on the implementation of a new corporate governance system in \nabout 80 state-owned enterprises (SOEs), privatization of a first group of 15 SOEs, corporate \nrestructuring in about 25 SOEs, design of a policy for labor redundancies, and implementation \nof a clean procurement system in SOEs. MSOE has made good progress in implementing \nSOEGPP; SOE reform in general, which the Government considers an anchor of governance \nreform, has gained strong momentum. During stage two the following reforms will continue to be \nimplemented  covering  all  SOEs:  (i)  continued  improvement  in  the  application  of  the  new \ncorporate governance standards and practices for SOEs, (ii) restructuring the finances and \noperations  of  SOEs  that  are  suitable  candidates  for  rapid  improvement  and  subsequent \ndivestment, (iii) privatization of further SOEs with emphasis on private public partnerships, and \n(iv)  selling  of  additional  minority  shareholdings.  Additionally,  the  following  reforms  will  be \nimplemented: (i) preparing for private sector participation in the plantation industry, (ii) designing \nand implementing suitable regulatory systems for infrastructure industries in preparation for \nprivatization, and (iii) segregating and commercializing public service obligations (PSOs).  \n \n3.  The introduction of sound  corporate  governance  standards  and  practices  involves \nsetting in place a set of structures, procedures, and incentives that empower managers to \ncreate shareholder value under adequate supervision, in a transparent environment, and with \nadequate accountability. This includes contractual arrangements to improve accountability and \ntransparency,  as  well  as  enforcement  of  commercial  laws,  standards,  and  regulations. \nAccountability  has  been  established  through  standardized  and  formalized  contractual \narrangements, which involve the Government agreeing on statements of corporate intent (SCIs) \nand entering into appointment agreements with commissioners and directors of SOEs. \n \n4.  Under the SOEGPP, at least 80 SOEs will submit an SCI to MSOE. Going beyond the \nfinancial and corporate information required in the annual report of a listed company, the SCI \nprovides specific and strategic directions to the board of directors (BOD). The SCI defines the \n(i) objectives and scope of SOE activities; (ii) business and corporate restructuring plan and an \nassessment of cost and savings; (iii) accounting policies; (iv) performance targets in relation to \n                                                 \n1  Stage one of this 10-year program is supported by ADB. 2001.

Manila (Loan 1866-INO, approved on 4 December 2001 for $400 million). \n2  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 October 2002. \n3  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for the Privatization and Restructuring of State-\nOwned  Enterprises.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2001.

Manila. \n ", "2  \nprescribed objectives; (v) information requirements of the shareholding ministry; (vi) compliance \nwith environmental legislation to be confirmed through certification by accredited agency (e.g., \nISO  140004);  (vii) employment  status  of  staff  and  compliance  with  laws  and  regulations \nregarding labor relations; (viii) procedures to be followed for acquisition or sale of shares and \ndivestment of subsidiaries; (ix) compensation for SOE activities from the public sector, if any; \nand (x) procedures for financial valuation of SOEs. While significant progress in this area of \ncorporate governance has been made, MSOE needs strengthened capacity to evaluate the \nsubmitted SCIs. \n \n5.  In conjunction with SCIs, the Government as shareholder enters into formal agreements \nwith all newly appointed commissioners and directors. The Government has announced the \nappointment  criteria,  roles,  responsibilities,  and  accountability  of  boards  of  commissioners \n(BOCs)  and  BODs.5  The  appointment  agreements  foster  the  autonomy  of  SOEs  and \naccountability of supervisors and management by establishing individual and collective roles \nand responsibilities for implementing the SCI. In preparing the agreements, MSOE regularly \nreviews the composition of the BOCs and BODs, including the number of members, and their \nskills mix and qualifications.6 Parallel to these efforts, a new performance incentive system has \nbeen introduced for all SOEs to reward management and staff for improvements in defined \nperformance indicators. This new corporate governance system needs to be systematically \nreviewed with respect to impact on SOE management behavior with the objective of identifying \nareas in need of further assistance. \n \n6.  So far, the Government implemented corporate restructuring in 25 commercially viable \nSOEs by June 2003. These activities concentrate on companies in the construction, fertilizer, \nand  plantation  industries.  Additionally,  MSOE  is  working  on  corporate  restructuring  in  the \nelectricity, toll roads, and airline sectors. Financial restructuring of SOEs can involve (i) selling of \nsubsidiaries and/or surplus assets, (ii) equity injection from third parties, (iii) mergers of SOEs, \nand (iv) debt restructuring. Restructuring of operations can involve changes in (i) management \ninformation  systems,  (ii)  production  and  logistics  planning,  (iii) distribution  network,  (iv) \nmarketing strategy, (v) workforce number and composition, and (vi) organization structure. The \nrestructuring and eventual privatization of SOEs has been conducted in a transparent manner to \nattract private sector investors who can inject new capital in viable SOEs. Building on the \nexperience, MSOE needs to continue to develop the restructuring plans to continue with the \nimplementation of the SOE reform program. The SCI has already become the main strategy \ndocument  that  contains  a  time-bound  action  plan  and  targets  for  improving  financial \nperformance  and  implementing  the  selected  restructuring  option  for  the  given  SOE.  With \nassistance  from  ADB  TA  (footnote  3),  MSOE  has  established  a  comprehensive  financial \ndatabase and portfolio management system, which helps in design and monitoring of corporate \nrestructuring programs. \n \n                                                 \n4  The ISO 14000 series is a family of environmental management standards developed by the International \nOrganization for Standardization (ISO). The ISO 14000 standards are designed to provide an internationally-\nrecognized framework for environmental management, measurement, evaluation and auditing. They do not \nprescribe environmental performance targets, but instead provide organizations with the tools to assess and \ncontrol the environmental impact of their activities, products or services. The standards address the following \nsubjects: environmental management systems; environmental auditing; environmental labels and declarations; \nenvironmental performance evaluation; and life cycle assessment. \n5  Decree of the Minister of Finance No. 146/KMK.05/2001 \n6  The review includes the role, obligations, and composition of BOCs and BODs to verify whether the BOC has \nguided and monitored the implementation by the BOD of (i) SOE\u2019s long-term plan, (ii) annual business plan, and \n(iii) budget. \n ", "  3\n7.  The SOEGPP targets satisfactory progress in the following two areas: (i) privatization7 of \nseven SOEs by July 20038 and another eight SOEs by July 2004, and (ii) disposal of the \nminority shareholdings in five companies by July 20039 and a further seven companies by July \n2004. To ensure smooth and transparent privatization, MSOE has developed an analytical \nframework and evaluation methods for SOE privatization under ADB-financed TA.10  MSOE has \nreviewed the legal and regulatory environment, including the Tax Law and Land Law, and \nprepared  procedures  for  the  various  privatization  options,  such  as  initial  public  offering, \nemployee/management buy-out, strategic sale, and sale to an existing investor, as well as for \nliquidation. These procedures as well as the new corporate governance system are reflected in \na new SOE Law (19/2003).11 However, while implementing the privatization program several \nobstacles emerged, which the Government will overcome with assistance from this TA. \n \n8.  During implementation of SOEGPP corporate restructuring of state-owned plantations \n(PTPN)12 was a focus area. The Government does not have the option of fully privatizing any of \nthe PTPNs outright, before considerable restructuring has taken place and land title issues have \nbeen  resolved.  However,  the  Government  can  accelerate  the  restructuring  process  by \ncommercializing selected activities or business lines of the PTPNs via partnerships with private \ninvestors. A major constraint is that most of the PTPNs can make contributions only in kind \n(mostly land and unutilized buildings), not in cash. Nevertheless, several PTPNs report serious \ninterest from the private sector. MSOE will have to ensure that such cooperation will give due \nconsideration  for  the  interests  of  the  employees,  adjacent  smallholders,  and  other  local \nstakeholders. \n \n9.  During  2001-2002  MSOE,  and  the  Ministry  for  Communication  designed  for  the \ntelecommunications sector a new regulatory framework that enabled MSOE to privatize PT \nIndosat  in  December  2002.  Similarly,  MSOE,  in  cooperation  with  the  relevant  technical \nministries, will have to create new regulatory frameworks for other infrastructure sectors, e.g., \nairports, seaports, toll roads, postal services, and gas transmission. While significant work has \nbeen  done  in  these  areas,  it  has  yet  to  be  transformed  into  a  program  with  a  rigorous \nimplementation  schedule  aiming  at  either  further  privatizations  facilitating  private  sector \nparticipation in the infrastructure sectors.  \n \n10.  Another impediment to privatizations is the public service obligations (PSOs). During \nphase one, MSOE prepared the separation of PSOs from the purely commercial activities of \nSOEs. MSOE, with assistance from ADB-financed TA13 has (i) identified PSOs in all SOEs; \n(ii) quantified the monetary value of performing PSOs in 15 SOEs; and (iii) developed rules and \nregulations for contracting such services on a competitive bidding basis, allowing participation \n                                                 \n7  Defined as a reduction in the Government\u2019s share in the voting shares of a company (held directly or indirectly) to \nless than 50%. \n8  By July 2003, the Government has sold  41.94% of PT Indosat to  Singapore Technologies Telemedia.  The \nshareholding of the Government is now down to 15%. This is a key achievement in terms of price received and \npolitical resistance overcome. \n9  The Government of Indonesia\u2019s 42% shareholding in PT Wisma Nusantara was sold in December 2002. The \nGovernment\u2019s 16-87% shareholdings in Indocement was sold in October 2003. Three more transactions are to be \ncompleted in the near future. \n10 ADB.  1998.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Corporate  Governance  and  Enterprise \nRestructuring. Manila. \n11  In June 2003, the Government enacted Law 19 of 2003 (SOE Law), which was drafted with assistance from ADB \nfinanced consultants, and provides a legal framework for the reform program, which will be reviewed under this TA. \n12 There are 14 SOEs in the plantation sector: PT Perkebunan Nusantara I to XIV. \n13  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Commercialization of Public Service Obligations. \nManila. \n ", "4  \nby private companies. The objective was to establish a transparent process for the separation of \nPSOs with due consultation of all stakeholders. The result of this process has to be transformed \ninto a sequenced program of commercialization of PSOs by SOEs to be implemented over a \ngiven time schedule. \n \n11.  ADB is the lead agency supporting SOE reform, which is regarded as a key component \nof the overall structural reform process as emphasized in the Government\u2019s letter of intent to \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  in  1998.  In  addition  to  ADB  assistance,  MSOE  is  currently \nreceiving some small-scale TA for socialization of SOE reform from the United States Agency \nfor International Development (USAID), which is considering further TA in 2004. The mission \nhas coordinated with USAID in the design of this TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The TA will assist MSOE in continuing the reforms of SOE that include (i) assessing of \nthe potential for further corporate restructuring and privatization of SOEs, including public \nprivate partnerships in the plantation industry; (ii) identifying weaknesses in the new system of \ncorporate  governance  for  SOEs  and  recommending  improvements  to  be  made,  including \ncapacity building in MSOE for evaluation of SCIs; (iii) formulating a program for implementation \nof regulatory frameworks in infrastructure industries; and (iv) commercializing PSOs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will help MSOE to identify remaining weaknesses in the corporate governance \nsystem  implemented  so  far  and  recommend  further  improvements  to  be  made.  The \nrecommendations will be based on the experience of implementing SCIs and management \ncontracts (appointment agreements) with commissioners and directors. The new performance \nincentive  system,  introduced  for  30  SOEs  in  2002  to  reward  management  and  staff  for \nimproving defined performance indicators, will be reviewed and will recommend how to make \nthe system more flexible in its application to individual SOEs.  Furthermore, the TA will review \nthe  results  of  the  independent  procurement  audits  conducted  under  the  SOEGPP,  and \nrecommend  the  best  practices  to  be  applied  in  SOE  procurement,  and  will  assess  the \neffectiveness of the new SOE Law and its suitability for the future reform program. \n \n14.  Using  a  comprehensive  database  of  SOEs,  designed  for  portfolio  management \npurposes, the TA will develop new restructuring and privatization plans for 30 SOEs to update \nthe 3-year privatization pipeline. In this context, the TA will support preparation of the financial \nand  operational  restructuring  of  up  to  15  SOEs,  but  not  new  investments  to  expand  or \nmodernize production facilities, which will be left to private sector investors. The TA will also \nsupport the Government\u2019s preparations of privatization of up to 15 SOEs in line with procedures \nfor privatization options developed under a previous TA (footnote 9) by applying the analytical \nframework developed under that TA. One focus area of the TA will be the restructuring of \nplantations by commercialization of selected activities or business lines via partnerships with \nprivate investors. \n \n15.  The TA will help the Government design a program for the sequenced implementation of \nregulatory frameworks for infrastructure industries. The objective will be to privatize SOEs in the \nsectors and to attract private investment. A strong emphasis will be put on the separation of \nregulatory function and service delivery. Additionally, the TA will assist MSOE and relevant \n ", "  5\ntechnical ministries in designing a program for commercializing PSOs, to be implemented in the \nsecond phase of SOE reforms. \n \n16.  The TA will help the Government organize and conduct seminars on SOE  reform to \ndisseminate the findings of this TA and to reach agreement with all relevant Government \nagencies and stakeholders on the design implementation plan for further reforms of the SOE \nsector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $800,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $433,000 and a local currency cost of $367,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $600,000 equivalent, covering the total foreign exchange cost \nand $167,000 of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide $200,000 \nequivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and workshops (Appendix 1). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The  TA  Executing  Agency  will  be  MSOE.  The  steering  committee,  established  in \nJanuary 2002 for overseeing implementation of the SOEGPP, will monitor the implementation of \nthis  TA  and  ensure  smooth  coordination between MSOE staff and consultants. About 19 \nperson-months of international consulting services (individual consultants) will be required. The \ninternational  consultants  will  consist  of  experts  in  privatization,  company  restructuring, \ninfrastructure  regulation,  and  corporate  governance.  Domestic  (individual)  consultants  will \nprovide  36  person-months  of  consulting  services  in  corporate  governance,  corporate \nrestructuring, and law. The project framework is attached as Appendix 2. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with its  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will be implemented during 12 \nmonths, to be completed by December 2004. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n           Foreign              Local  Total\nItem  Exchange Currency                 Cost \nA.

The individual consultants to be hired under this technical assistance (TA) will work \nclosely  with  staff  of  the  Ministry  for  State-Owned  Enterprises  (MSOE).  To  enable  close \ncooperation from the start of the TA, the Government has decided to place oversight of the TA under \nthe Steering Committee established for implementing the State-Owned Enterprise Governance and \nPrivatization Program (SOEGPP). \n \n2.  This TA will prepare further details for the continuing reforms of state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs), i.e., State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Project (SOERP), Phase Two, to commence \nin late 2004. The TA will require the services of a team of international and domestic experts in \nprivatization,  corporate  finance  and  restructuring,  corporate  governance,  capital  market  and \ncommercial law, accounting, and auditing. The TA will deliver the following outcomes: \n \n(i)  The consultants will help MSOE to identify remaining weaknesses in the corporate \ngovernance  system  implemented  under  the  SOEGPP,  and  recommend \nimprovements that need to be made. The recommendations will be derived from \nimplementing statements of corporate intent (SCIs) and management contracts \n(appointment agreements) with commissioners  and directors. The SCIs provide \nMSOE  with  a  corporate  governance  instrument  more  rigorous  than  what  is \nrequired  from  listed  companies.  The  appointment  agreements  are  fostering \nautonomy  as  well  as  accountability  of  SOE  supervisors  and  managers  by \nestablishing individual and collective roles and responsibilities for implementing \nSCIs. A new performance incentive system has been introduced for 30 SOEs in \n2002  to  reward  management  and  staff  for  improving  defined  performance \nindicators.  The  TA  will  review  the  results  and  make  recommendations  for \nimprovement.  Furthermore, the TA will review the results of the independent \nprocurement audits conducted under the SOEGPP, and recommend the best \npractices to be applied in SOE procurement. \n \n(ii)  Using a comprehensive database designed for portfolio management purposes, \nthe TA will develop new restructuring and privatization plans for 30 SOEs to \nupdate  the  3-year  privatization  pipeline.  In  this  context,  the  TA  will  support \npreparation of the financial and operational restructuring of up to 15 SOEs; new \ninvestments to expand or modernize production facilities will be left to private \nsector  investors.  The  TA  will  also  support  the  Government\u2019s  preparations  to \nprivatize up to 15 SOEs, in line with procedures for privatization options developed \nunder a previous TA1 by applying the analytical framework developed under that \nTA. In preparation of restructuring and privatization, the TA will provide legal \nadvice to the Government covering all relevant aspects of (a) laws on property, \nprotection of competition, business, public property, and SOEs; and of (b) general \npublic law matters. The TA will not cover drafting of laws and regulations. \n \n(iii)  The consultants will help the Government to design a program for the sequenced \nimplementation of new regulatory frameworks for infrastructure industries.
