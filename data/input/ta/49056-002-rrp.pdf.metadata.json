THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Access to Clean Energy Investment Program. The \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  capacity  development  and \nperformance monitoring for the program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The proposed Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance will contribute to Pakistan\u2019s \nnational goal of enhanced energy security. The program will be implemented over 5 years and \nwill support the governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPP) and Punjab province to \nachieve increased access to sustainable and more reliable electricity services, particularly for \nvulnerable communities in KPP and Punjab.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Country context. Pakistan\u2019s economic growth declined significantly in FY2010\u2013FY2014, \nlargely  as  a  result  of  increasingly  intense  energy  shortages,  rising  food  prices,  security \nchallenges, and natural disasters.3 In 2014, 29.5% of the population of 180 million was living \nbelow the national poverty line, with substantial disparity in the poverty rate between urban \n(18.2%)  and  rural  (35.6%)  areas.4 Energy  access  and  affordability  plays  a  critical  role  in \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Although  Pakistan  has  abundant  renewable  and \nnonrenewable energy resources, public and private investment in energy infrastructure has \nremained inadequate and the system suffers heavily from the low efficiency of generation, \ntransmission, and distribution networks. Although the timing of outages has become predictable, \nthe 5\u2013gigawatt demand\u2013supply gap combined with the stressed transmission and distribution \nsystem result in significant load shedding\u201410 hours per day in rural areas and 4 hours in urban \nareas.  Overreliance  on  imported  conventional  fuel-based  generation,  high  consumer \nreceivables, and insufficient tariffs have resulted in persistent circular debt.5 Pakistan\u2019s potential \nrenewable energy resources total more than 65,000 megawatts (MW), but current installed \ngeneration  capacity  from  these  sources  is  only  7,100  MW  (35%  of  total  generation).  The \nnational electrification rate is only 67%,6 and it is even lower (57%) in rural areas. \n \n4.  Provincial context. The focus on renewable energy development in KPP and Punjab \nsupports  the  Government  of  Pakistan\u2019s  strategy  of  lowering  stress  on  the  national  grid, \ndecreasing load shedding, and increasing access to electricity using the least-cost option, which \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  In 2015, ADB provided program preparatory TA for Access to Clean Energy Investment (TA 9047-PAK). \n3  Average annual economic growth during FY2010\u2013FY2014 was 3.5%, down from 5.1% in FY2005\u2013FY2009.

Islamabad (Executive Summary). \n ", "2 \nwill reduce circular debt. KPP, with a population of 28.3 million, is one of the poorest provinces \nin Pakistan, and the most unequal, with 38% of its rural population living in households in the \npoorest quintile.7 In some districts, the electrification rate is  below 20% (it is just  2.9% in \nKohistan and 15% in Shangla). Geographic constraints make extending the national grid to such \nremote areas costly and technically difficult. In these areas, the least-cost option is off-grid \nrenewable  energy  sources.  Punjab  has the  largest  population  of  Pakistan\u2019s  provinces  and \nconsumes around 68% of the country\u2019s electricity and gas. The economy is based largely on \nagriculture and industry, and depends heavily on a reliable electricity supply. In Punjab, service \ndelivery  can  be  improved  and  the  transmission  and distribution  system stress  reduced  by \nshifting some demand to off-grid/self-generation using solar power. In view of the overstretched \nnational grid, the 2017\u20132026 provincial energy sector master plans of the KPP and Punjab \nprovincial  governments  have  prioritized  renewable  resources,8 with  a  view  to  expanding \nelectrification and reliable energy in line with the national strategy, and with an emphasis on \nproviding  an  uninterrupted  electricity  supply  for  schools  and  primary  health  care  facilities \n(PHFs).9 In KPP, the installation of up to 1,000 kilowatts of micro-hydropower plants (MHPs)10 \ncould supply off-grid communities with basic electricity services. \n \n5.  Social and gender context. An estimated 38% of KPP\u2019s population lives below the \nnational  poverty  line,11 while  49%  of  the  population  in  KPP  and  31%  in  Punjab  live  in \nmultidimensional  poverty. 12 The  most  deprived  communities\u2014such  as  Kohistan,  with  a \nmultidimensional poverty incidence of 96%\u2014were selected for off-grid electrification. About 20% \nof schools in KPP and 10% in Punjab are not connected to the electricity grid. PHFs in rural \nareas are subject to long hours of load shedding, making it difficult to provide effective services, \nand keep lifesaving drugs and vaccines for diseases such as polio refrigerated. \n   \n6.  The  availability  of  electricity  in  schools  improves  the  learning  environment,  and \ncontributes to student enrollment. Women and girls benefit from access to electricity through \ntime savings associated with firewood or water collection activities, and the use of appliances \n(e.g., washing machines, cell phones, refrigerators, fans, and irons). Electric appliances improve \nindoor air quality. Providing solar power to PHFs that provide antenatal care, delivery, and child \nhealth benefits rural women in particular. Over 2.7 million women in KPP and 48.2 million in \nPunjab could benefit from improved electricity access at PHFs.13 \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n7.  Fit  with  national  priorities. Pakistan\u2019s overall national goal for 2025 is to achieve \ninclusive and dynamic economic growth, with energy security as a supporting pillar (footnote 6). \nThe energy sector goal is to ensure uninterrupted access to affordable and clean energy for all \nPakistanis, with quantitative targets for (i) increasing electricity access from 67% to over 90% by \n2025,  (ii)  eliminating  the  current  electricity  supply\u2013demand gap  by  2018,14 and  (iii) adding \n                                                \n7  Government of Pakistan. 2015.

Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2015\uf02d2019. Manila. \n ", "3 \n25,000 MW of generation capacity by 2025 (24,000 MW installed as of 2015). These national \ntargets cannot be achieved without increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy \nmix.15 This is the context in which the government has requested ADB support to increase \naccess to sustainable and reliable electricity services. \n \n8.  Provincial priorities. The results-based lending (RBL) program will help address the \nenergy shortage and low electrification rate in KPP and Punjab by supporting the installation of \nMHPs (small run-of-the stream or canal plants) in off-grid communities, and solar facilities in \nschools and PHFs. The KPP and Punjab development strategies emphasize inclusive and pro-\npoor economic growth, which requires access to reliable electricity. The relevant provincial \ntargets include (i) by 2026, expanding solar power generation capacity by 42 MW in KPP and \n2,330 MW in Punjab, and adding 5,204 MW of hydropower generation capacity in KPP; (ii) \nproviding electricity to more than 1.5 million people from MHPs in KPP; and (iii) achieving \nsavings from energy efficiency in Punjab. The two provinces have requested ADB support to \nfinance and build capacity. In KPP, ADB helped develop the electrification road map and \ninstitutional strengthening plan, which will serve as the foundation for the program. \n \n9.  Fit with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities. The program is in line with (i) the ADB Strategy \n2020  midterm  review, 16 which  emphasizes  inclusive  economic  growth,  infrastructure \ndevelopment, and engagement in middle-income countries; and (ii) the ADB country partnership \nstrategy, 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan.17 The provision of energy to poor, remote rural areas outside \nthe national grid (i) is a priority in ADB\u2019s Energy Policy;18 (ii) will expand energy access and \ncontribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, \nreliable, sustainable and modern energy for all; and (iii) with its renewable energy outputs, will \ncontribute to ADB climate financing. The program has strong linkages with other ADB projects, \nas it will provide relief to stressed national transmission and distribution systems, and balance \nthe energy mix, which are the basis for key ADB interventions. \n \n10.  Results-based lending. RBL is the most suitable modality because (i) the program\u2019s \nbusiness model, which is community-driven from design to operation and maintenance, requires \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)\u2014and  the  private  sector  for  the  MHPs\u2014to  lead  the \ncontractor team and be responsible for community mobilization and sustainability; the NGOs \nsuccess and eligibility for further projects are measured by the results achieved, which fits RBL \nrather  than  investment  projects:  (ii)  by  monitoring  results,  RBL  reduces  transaction  costs \ncompared with investment projects, which would have extremely difficult to control inputs to \nthousands of schools, health facilities, and communities; (iii) RBL foster government and local \nownership on a large decentralized scale and leverage system improvements at provincial, \ndistrict, and local levels, without which provincial targets for electrification from decentralized \nrenewable sources cannot be achieved; (iv) by focusing on achieving results, which requires \ngreater engagement and attitudinal changes from all stakeholders, the targeted indicators will \nensure greater benefits for vulnerable communities and women, and enhance coordination \namong  the  program\u2019s  diverse  stakeholders;  (v)  both  provinces,  having  managed  and \nimplemented ADB as well as other donor funded projects before, have adequate capacity for \nthe RBL program; and (vi) ADB\u2019s vast experience and knowledge of the energy sector in \nPakistan lays a technically sound and robust basis for the first energy RBL for the country. \n                                                \n15 Government of Pakistan, 2006.

ADB-supported  interventions  will  add  value  by  (i)  strengthening  the  systems  and \ninstitutional capacity of provincial governments; (ii) complementing infrastructure support for \nrenewable  energy  facilities  with  enhanced  support  for  off-grid  electrification;  (iii)  improving \nprogram design to enhance sustainability, inclusive growth, and women\u2019s empowerment; (iv) \nsupporting innovations such as business models for off-grid electrification and net-zero emission \nbuilding models, which can then be replicated beyond the life of the program; and (v) developing \nand implementing a monitoring system that will ensure sustainability and results mapping. \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n12.  The RBL program will support two broader KPP and Punjab provincial government \nprograms for providing uninterrupted access to affordable and clean energy, as set out in their \nrespective power sector master plans (footnote 8). The RBL program will support each of these \ntwo provincial programs, notably those portions that cover community-based renewable energy \ninitiatives and public sector energy efficiency (Table 1). Under the RBL program, the MHPs will \nprovide electricity to around 1.5 million people in rural areas of KPP, and solar plants installed at \nschools will provide electricity to more than 2.6 million students, including 1.2 million girls. The \nMHP program will be implemented with the assistance of NGOs, hired through a competitive \nprocurement process serving as the lead partner of the contractor, and responsible for site \nselection, feasibility study and community mobilization. The contractor will be responsible for the \nconstruction of the plant and the training of the community team on operation and maintenance. \nThe community organizations will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the plant \nand collection of the cost recovery tariff to ensure sustainability. The RBL program will exclude \nactivities that would be classified as category A under the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009), and those that would involve  the procurement of works, goods,  or services under \ncontracts whose estimated value exceeds specified monetary amounts.19 \n \nTable 1: Program Scope \nItem  Broader Government Program  Results-Based Lending Program \nOutcome  Uninterrupted access to affordable and  Increased access to sustainable and more reliable \nclean energy for all population groups  electricity services, particularly for vulnerable \ncommunities in KPP and Punjab \nKey outputs  (i) Expanded generation capacity, (ii)  (i) Renewable energy-based power plants installed, \nincreased electrification rates, (iii)  (ii) Opportunity for women and girls to obtain \nincreased renewable energy generation,  energy services and benefits increased, (iii) \nand (iv) increased private sector  Institutional capacity to foster sustainability \ninvestment in energy sector development  enhanced, and (iv) promotion of public sector \nenergy efficiency. \nActivity types  (i) Development of renewable and thermal  (i) Installation of micro-hydropower plants in rural \nenergy resources, (ii) development and  KPP, (ii) introduction of sustainable business \nenforcement of policies and regulations,  models for off-grid power, (iii) implementation of \n(iii) provision of reliable electricity to all,  off-grid decentralized solar solutions for education \nand (iv) demand-side management and  and primary health care facilities in KPP and \nenergy efficiency initiatives  Punjab, and (iv) Public sector energy efficiency \npromoted in Punjab. \nProgram  $26 billion:  $454.3 million  \nexpenditure  $10 billion for KPP  $330.3 million for KPP \n$16 billion for Punjab  $124.0 million for Punjab \nMain financiers  Provincial government: $25.3 billion  Provincial government: $40.8 million (9.0%) \nand respective   Community: $30 million  Community: $9.9 million (2.2%) \n                                                \n19 The amounts are currently $50 million for works, turnkey and supply, and installation contracts; $30 million for \ngoods; $20 million for information technology systems and nonconsulting services; and $15 million for consulting \nservices.

Program Results \n \n13.  Impact  and  outcome. The RBL program\u2019s impact is aligned with the national goal \n(footnote 14) of inclusive economic growth through sustainable energy access. The outcome will \nbe  increased  access  to  sustainable  and  more  reliable  electricity  services,  particularly  for \nvulnerable communities in KPP and Punjab. This will be achieved through four outputs: \n(i)  Output 1: Renewable energy-based power plants installed. This output will \nsupport the installation of 1,000 MHPs in off-grid areas of KPP. MHPs will be \ndeveloped based on reliable business models and sustainable tariff structures.20 \nThe output will also support the provision and installation of rooftop solar plants \nfor 23,000 schools and 2,587 PHFs in the two provinces and a university in \nBahawalpur, Punjab. Facilities without any electricity and those receiving only a \nfew hours of electricity per day will be prioritized. \n(ii)  Output 2: Opportunity for women and girls to obtain energy services and \nbenefits increased. This output will facilitate providing basic services that can \ncontribute to women\u2019s empowerment and well-being, and gender mainstreaming. \nGirls\u2019 schools in both provinces will be prioritized for the provision of electricity. In \nKPP,  the  program  will  identify  and  prioritize  households  headed  by  women, \nwhich are usually the poorest and most marginalized, by providing electricity from \nMHPs. Women will benefit from the time saved and the improved living standards, \nand have increased access to training and enhanced livelihood opportunities. \nThe program will ensure round-the-clock electricity to PHFs. \n(iii)  Output  3:  Institutional  capacity  to  foster  sustainability  enhanced.  This \ncomponent will address capacity challenges that constrain program sustainability. \nThe output will ensure institutional strengthening of critical systems (e.g., for \nmonitoring, procurement, and internal audit). A web-based program performance \nmonitoring system will be established under the program. \n(iv)  Output 4: Public sector energy efficiency promoted. This output will support \nenergy efficiency audits in Punjab, and develop a methodology for follow-up on \naudit recommendations. It will also support to develop standards and the design \nfor  a  net-zero  energy  building,  based  on  the  results  achieved  from  the \nconstruction of a model building for the energy department. \n \n14.

DLIs and other performance indicators have been selected to provide ambitious yet \nachievable measures of progress toward the program outcome and outputs. The outcome DLI \n(DLI 1) measures the number of people that benefit from access to reliable electricity (target: \n240,000  households  and  2.6 million  students).  Under  output  1,  DLI 2  monitors  the  power \ngeneration capacity added from clean energy sources (target: 182 MW additional capacity), and \nDLI  3  tracks  the  number  of  locations  with  installed  renewable  energy-based  power  plants \n(target: 1,000 MHPs, 23,000 schools, and 2,587 PHFs). Under output 2, two DLIs 4 and 5 \nensure that  planning  and  targeting give  special  attention  to  girls\u2019  schools  and  households \nheaded by women. Under output 3, DLI 6 focuses on improving governance and systems for \nfinancial  management  and  procurement,  while  DLI  7  promotes  effective  and  continuous \nperformance monitoring, which is essential to the program\u2019s success. Under output 4, DLI 8 \ntracks progress on energy efficiency measures. \n \n16.  The DLI selection process was based on the outcomes of due diligence conducted \nunder  the  project  preparatory  TA.  Best  practices  have  been  structured  into  the  program\u2019s \nbusiness model, with adoption of such practices made part of the program. The targets for each \nquantitative DLI were based on provincial averages, which are quite high when compared with \nthe rural areas targeted by the program. Similarly, targets for DLIs 4 and 5 (regarding gender) \nwere  developed  based  on  current  statistics  and  on  empirical  evidence  that  girls\u2019  schools \nhouseholds headed by women need special attention in planning and targeting. DLIs 6 and 7 \n ", "7 \nseek to strengthen institutional setups; these are ambitious in seeking to institute essential new \nprocedures and systems (e.g., the establishment of institutionalized procurement procedures; \nan internal audit function that meets the standards set by the auditor-general of Pakistan; and \nmost importantly, a web-based monitoring system with functions beyond traditional monitoring). \nFor the quantitative indicators on households and students (DLI 1), off-grid generation capacity \nand  number  of  sites  (DLIs  2  and  3),  indicative  baseline  numbers  are  not  available  as \ninterventions  must  be site-specific. These targets  have  been  set  based  on  terrain,  results \nachieved  by  similar  projects  developed  by  NGOs,  and  a  comparison  with  provincial  data. \nSimilarly, the disbursement amount allocated to each DLI depends on its proportion for program \nsuccess, with bigger shares allocated to critical DLIs (e.g., MHP development, which has the \nlargest impact on results). \n \n17.  Disbursement allocation and schedule. Financing under the loan will be disbursed \nsubject to the achievement and verification of targets for each DLI in accordance with the \nverification protocols established for that DLI, including for multiple measurements within the \nsame target year. For some DLIs, the verification protocols allow partial disbursements, and \nearly as well as late achievement. An independent verification agent or agency (IVA) will verify \nthe satisfaction of the relevant DLIs (Appendix 3, Tables A3.1 and A3.2). \n \nE.  Expenditure Framework and Financing Plan \n \n18.  Program expenditures. The RBL program expenditures are estimated to be $454.3 \nmillion from 2017 to 2021 (Table 3). \n \nTable 3: Summary of Program Expenditure Framework, 2017\u20132021 \n(in 2016 prices) \n       Broader Government Program               Results-Based Lending Program \nPunjab  KPP  Total  Share  Punjab  KPP  Total  Share \nItem  ($ million)  (%)  Item  ($ million)  (%) \nHydropower  2,798  8,143  10,941  41.6  MHP  246.1  246.1  54.2 \nThermal \npower  8,568  1,054  9,622  36.6  Solar  101.2  35.30  136.5  30.0 \nSolar PV  1,973  117  2,089  8.0  Othersa  6.0  2.2  8.2  1.8 \nWind/biogas  1,793  0  1,793  6.8  IDC  6.0  18.0  24.0  5.3 \nOthers  1,135  699  1,834  7.0  Contingencies  10.8  28.7  39.5  8.7 \nTotal  16,267  10,013  26,280  100.0  Total  124.0  330.3  454.3  100.0 \na Others = recurrent cost and capacity building. \nIDC = interest during construction and commitment charges; KPP = Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, MHP = micro-\nhydropower plant, PV = photovoltaic. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provincial energy departments. \n \n19.

Disbursement arrangements. From 2017 onward and for disbursement purposes, the \nPakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization (PEDO) in KPP and the Office of the Chief \nEngineer (Power) in Punjab will periodically submit separate withdrawal applications, along with \nthe evidence of DLI achievement based on the relevant verification protocol. Before submission \nof the first withdrawal application, the Economic Affairs Division of Pakistan will submit to ADB \nthe evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications for each \nprovince on behalf of PEDO and the Office of the Chief Engineer (Power), together with the \nauthenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each  authorized  person.  The  government  will  then \narrange for the IVA to verify satisfaction of the relevant DLIs and submit its report. The loan \nproceeds will be disbursed through the State Bank of Pakistan to the respective provincial \nconsolidated  funds, 21 and  then  to  the  assignment  accounts  of  PEDO  and  the  Energy \nDepartment of Punjab (EDP). Advance financing of 15% is allowed to address related financing \nrequirements. The government will refund any advance financing amount outstanding within 6 \nmonths of program completion, if the DLIs are not achieved on or before program completion. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n21.  Capacity development activities will be carried out by consultants hired under the RBL \nprogram, complimenting the program results framework and DLIs, and have been detailed in the \nprogram action plan (PAP) covering actions in key areas. These activities will also complement \nthe physical investments and support the achievement of program results and sustainability. \n \nG.  Technical Assistance \n \n22.  TA for capacity development and program performance monitoring will support program \nimplementation and results achievement. The TA will hire experts during the RBL program \nperiod to (i) strengthen monitoring and evaluation (M&E) by PEDO and EDP, (ii) improve \nsafeguard management, and (iii) conduct a sampled verification of the IVA third-party validation \nreport.22 The TA will be implemented from December 2016 to December 2021 and is estimated \nat $800,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF-V). The government will support the TA in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice facilities, and other in-kind contributions. ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The program will be implemented from December 2016 to December 2021. In Punjab, \nEDP  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  Office  of  Chief  Engineer  (Power)  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. In KPP, the Energy and Power Department will be the executing agency \nand  PEDO  will  be  the  implementing  agency.

Systems will be \nenhanced as set out in the program action plan. Results verification will be conducted by the \nIVA, hired by the implementing agencies under the loan and acceptable to ADB. \n \nIII.   SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n24.  Assessments concluded that the program is well justified and technically sound. The use \nof off-grid renewable energy is the least-cost option for rural communities scattered over the \nmountainous areas of KPP province. The program will increase energy security, reduce reliance \non imported fuel, reduce the carbon footprint, and contribute to social equity. These conclusions \nunderpin the program\u2019s result areas, key actions, and performance indicators.  Design and \nimplementation arrangements are sound and the results framework is well designed, being \nbased on a robust causal analysis of the results chain. Each DLI indicator represents an action \ncritical to the achievement of the results. \n \n25.  The program will supply reliable electricity to schools, PHFs, and rural communities that \ncurrently either lack electricity or receive it for a very limited period, and use other sources (e.g., \nkerosene or candles) as alternatives. This benefit is incremental and valued at willingness to \npay. Some incremental benefits will also be contributed through the sale of saved electricity, \nwhich is assumed to be redistributed to the grid for customers without alternative means of \ngenerating electricity, valued at the current tariff rate plus subsidies. Similarly, non-incremental \nbenefits have been estimated at the resource saving value for electricity supplied to schools and \nPHFs that use alternative means, such as gasoline or diesel for generating electricity. The \neconomic internal rate of return is 17.4%, confirming the economic viability of the program.24 \n \n26.  Classification.  The  RBL  program  is  classified  general  intervention,  which  supports \npoverty reduction indirectly by providing electricity to poorer households, schools, and PHFs, \nand  by  supporting  skills  development.  The  program  is  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming, with (i) a gender-specific output and three gender-related DLIs, (ii) training on \ngender-inclusiveness, (iii) consultations with men and women during site selection and program \nimplementation, (iv) collection of baseline data for DLI verification, and (v) monitoring and \nevaluation of gender-related components. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n27.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  M&E  systems  of  PEDO  and  EDP  were \nassessed and measures to strengthen were identified. The current M&E indicators are limited \nand  are  the  responsibility  of  project  directors.  PEDO  focuses  on  monitoring  construction \n                                                \n23 The program will be financed by ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and cofinancing from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement. The funds of ADB and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement will be commingled and jointly used \nto finance the common expenditure framework of the program, including the individual procurement packages for \ngoods, works, and consulting services under the program.

Data \ncollection and reporting are done manually with assistance from management consultants, \nwhich will become challenging given the expanded number of monitoring indicators under the \nRBL, and the large number of sites. Institutional arrangements are satisfactory, with PEDO and \nEDP reporting to provincial authorities on program progress. The program will support a web-\nbased M&E system, which will enable PEDO and EDP to manage the expanded M&E activities. \nADB\u2019s TA (para. 22) will support training on verifying and monitoring indicators. \n \n28.  Fiduciary systems. The program will use country fiduciary systems for public financial \nmanagement, procurement, and anticorruption. These systems were assessed to determine \nwhether they would be able to manage fiduciary risks and provide assurance that RBL program \nfunds  are  used  for  their  intended  purposes,  with  economy  and  efficiency.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment confirms that adequate financial management capacity exists in the \nKPP  and  Punjab  provincial  governments,  with  sound  budgeting,  accounting,  and  financial \nreporting;  and  auditing procedures  and  practices.  Improvements  are needed  to strengthen \ninternal control and establish internal audit functions. The PAP includes mitigating measures to \nmanage fiduciary risks. \n \n29.  Procurement systems. The procurement systems and practices are sound and can \ndeliver  the  intended  outcomes.  Procurement  will  follow  the  respective  KPP  and  Punjab \nprovincial  procurement  rules,  which  are  both  largely  modeled  on  the  Federal  Public \nProcurement Rules of Pakistan. These rules are substantially aligned with international best \npractices  and  allow  for  open  competitive  bidding,  adequate  provision  for  advertising \nprocurement opportunities, and the use of standard bidding documents. The risks are assessed \nas high, because some provisions in the national procurement rules can be used to restrict \ncompetition  and  endow  procuring  entities  with  discretionary  powers  that  may  compromise \nfairness  and  transparency.  The  lack  of  established  procedures  and  procurement  manuals \nrepresents major weaknesses. The PAP sets out mitigating measures, including institutional \nstrengthening and ensuring that restrictive clauses are not used in bidding documents. \n \n30.  The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending Programs were explained to and discussed with the government, \nPEDO, and EDP.25 The government\u2019s anticorruption system is led by the National Accountability \nBureau at the federal and provincial levels. The Federal Investigation Agency, with its provincial \noffices,  has  the  authority  to  investigate  corruption  and  fraud  cases.  The  main  risk  is  the \nseemingly  reactive  nature  of  the  anticorruption  system  and  can  be  mitigated  through \nimplementing a proactive policy and increased awareness training. \n \n31.  Safeguard systems. A program safeguard systems assessment was conducted and \ndiscussed  with  program  stakeholders.  The  safeguard  classification  is  category  B  for  the \nenvironment, indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement. The climate risk to the program \nis rated as high. The potential impact of climate change on hydrology and irradiation can be \nmitigated to some extent during site selection. Activities under the program will involve civil \nworks with site-specific environmental impacts, which will be limited to the construction period, \nand will be addressed through adequate mitigation measures. Solar plants are to be placed on \nrooftops of existing facilities, while the land required for the MHPs will be provided voluntarily by \nthe beneficiary communities. MHP sites will be screened to exclude sites assessed category A \nfor the environment and with involuntary resettlement impacts.
