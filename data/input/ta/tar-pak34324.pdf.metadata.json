The Government of Pakistan\u2019s Interim Poverty Reduction Paper gives high priority to \nimproving  health  and  education  outcomes  and  reducing  malnutrition  among  women  and \nchildren. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting the Government with early childhood \ndevelopment (ECD), including in the health, education, rural development, agriculture, and \nfinancing sectors. ADB and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) also helped the \nGovernment explore ways of reducing rampant malnutrition.1 ADB is also planning to pilot a \nproject to improve the health and nutrition status of marginalized women and children. The \nGovernment has requested, and ADB has agreed, to include a loan for an ECD project for 2003 \nin the Country Strategy and Program for Pakistan. One of the three pillars of the Country \nStrategy and Program 2002\u20132004 is socially inclusive development, which will be strongly \nsupported by the proposed project. \n \n2.  The Fact-Finding Mission visited Pakistan from 8 July to 19 July 2002. The Government \nand the Mission reached an understanding on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing, \nand implementation arrangements for the TA.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Almost  half  of  Pakistani  households  fall  below  the  poverty  line,  with  a  higher \nconcentration  in  rural  areas,  and  poverty  increased  in  the  past  decade.  Low  human \ndevelopment status and insufficient social services have contributed to poverty. Because of the \nsocial structure and customs in Pakistan, women and girls have suffered even more due to less \naccess to nutrition, education, health care, and employment. As a result fertility and maternal, \ninfant, and child mortality remain high, while literacy, school enrollment, and school performance \nremain well below targets.  \n \n4.  Nutrition.  About 40% of children under the age of 5 years are either moderately or \nseverely underweight, implying that Pakistan has 8 million malnourished children. Malnutrition \naccounts for more than half of the under-five deaths in the country. About 42% of children under \n5 years are anemic due to poor diet and infections. Calorie, iron, and iodine deficiencies are the \nmajor nutrition problems. Data on low birth weight, drawn from hospital surveys and thus \nprobably an underestimate, suggest a prevalence rate of about 25\u201330%, a figure that has \nremained virtually unchanged since the 1980s and is one of the highest in the world.  \n \n5.  The main reason for the malnutrition in Pakistan is poverty (Appendix 1). This counts \nespecially for rural areas, where people do not have enough food or if there is food, it is lacking \nbasic micronutrients. Frequent illnesses and poor childcare also contribute to malnutrition.  \n \n6.  Growth failure starts early in childhood among Pakistani children. The prevalence of \nunderweight within an age group tends to increase over time. There is no significant gender \ndifferential in underweight prevalence but there is a rural-urban differential, with the prevalence \namong rural children being significantly higher than that among urban children (41.6% versus \n34.5%). Disturbing data from a resurvey of households in four districts (after 15 years) show no \nimprovement in child nutrition: by the time a child reaches age 5, he or she has a 45% chance \nof being underweight, 62% probability of being stunted, and 12% chance of being severely \nstunted. (Insufficient breastfeeding, poor diet, and diarrhea prevalence are the main causes.) \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1996. Reducing Child Malnutrition in Eight Asian Countries. (TA 5671). Manila. \n2   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 2002. ", "2 \nThese are very high levels of chronic malnutrition among children, and unless corrected will \ncontinue to depress learning, earning, and economic growth in Pakistan. Although no national \ndata are available on weight gain by pregnant women, hospital data suggest the average is \nabout 6 kilograms, half the recommended gain. Data from two national surveys suggest that \nchronic energy deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and deficiencies of iodine and vitamin A are \nthe most common nutrition problems in women of childbearing age. Iron deficiency anemia is \none of the leading causes of high maternal mortality and poor psychomotor and cognitive skills \nin children. Iodine deficiency affects half the population not using iodized salt, resulting in \nserious mental and physical deficiencies. Low birth weight is mainly due to poor nutrition in girls \nand women of reproductive age. Early childhood malnutrition results in high mortality, morbidity, \nand  disability,  and  long-term  intellectual  and  physical  deficits  in  those  who  survive.  The \neconomic  costs  of  maternal  and  child  malnutrition  are  also  high:  productivity  losses  are \nestimated to be at least 3% of gross domestic product annually, and cognitive losses in early \nchildhood lead to lifelong losses of learning and earning. \n \n7.  Health Status. The health of mothers and children in Pakistan is among the worst in \nAsia. The maternal mortality ratio is about 500 per 100,000 live births; infant mortality is about \n85, but is worse in poor rural areas, and much worse when mothers are illiterate, testifying to \nthe importance of maternal education in improving child health and welfare. Child under-five \nmortality follows the same pattern. The delivery of preventive health care at the community level \nis weak, but may improve if the cadre of lady health workers (LHWs) is increased. The number \nof LHWs should be raised to 100,000 from 70,000; but they must be provided with logistics to \nassess, treat, and refer children with severe or organic deficits that impede healthful functioning. \n \n8.  Health Care. Inequitable access leads to problems, especially for poor families and their \nchildren. Often there is little awareness of the specific health needs of children. Pakistan has a \npublic  system  of  health  care  provision,  including  primary  and  secondary  care,  which  is \nsupposed to be free of charge. However, most Pakistanis spend a large share of their income \non health. Private expenditure is estimated to be three times the amount spent by the public \nsector. The private sector is rapidly expanding due to problems in the public sector, for example \nwith absenteeism of staff and lack of drugs.  \n \n9.  Education.  Schooling  remains  inequitably  distributed  among  income  groups  and \nprovinces. Half the population is illiterate. Seven million children are out of primary school. \nApproximately 15% of boys and 50% of girls do not enter school. For many rural children, in \nparticular girls, social and physical access to education remains a major problem. Remote \nschools often do not have a teacher. Among children who start primary school, there is a 50% \ndrop out rate by the second year. This is partly caused by poor school performance. First grade \nis often overcrowded, and includes those who started schooling when over 6 years old, and \nyounger  siblings  of  those  attending  school.  Children  are  ill  prepared  for  school  due  to \ninadequate preschool intellectual stimulus. Most schools do not have a kindergarten, and few \nchildren receive some form of education before they are 5 years old. Parents often are not \naware of the education needs of children. \n \n10.  Early Childhood Development. Studies have shown that poor child care leads to \nincreased  mortality  and  disability,  and  results  in  stunting,  poor  school  performance,  and \nintellectual underachievement. Providing a caring and stimulating environment for the young \nchild needs to be done at household level and cannot be achieved through institutional service \ndelivery.  To  reach  household  levels,  especially  the  poor,  in  cost-effective  way  requires \ncommunity-based  interventions  and  the  establishment  of  community-based  organizations \n(CBOs) to support social service efforts. While various community workers and teachers of ", "    3 \ngovernment departments provide specific services at the community level, they do not have \nmuch  experience  supporting  CBOs  in  the  management  of  integrated  ECD  services.  The \ninvolvement  of  these  CBOs  can  be  best  promoted  through  elected  representatives,  local \ngovernment,  and  specialized  agencies  like  rural  support  programs  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). As the ECD concept is relatively new to Pakistan and therefore has no \ninstitutional  framework,  it  should  first  be  introduced  in  communities  that  already  have \nestablished CBOs that are involved in, for example, rural development programs. Once ECD \ninterventions have been successfully implemented, they can be used as models and replicated \nin neighboring villages.  \n \n11.  Government Services. The government provides an extensive network of education \nand health services. However, these services often do not reach those most in need, or reach \nthem in a limited way. Vulnerable children under five, in particular those from poor rural families, \nare often not reached by conventional public services. The education system is supporting \nchildren from four years of age and above (including kindergarten). Health services often focus \non curative care, while not addressing the underlying causes of ill health of children such as \npoor diet or hygiene. LHWs focus on a limited range of services reflecting the priority of national \nvertical programs. However, they give less attention to basic problems like unhygienic living \nconditions;  poor  diet;  poor  quality  drinking  water;  and  support  to  caregivers  for  child \ndevelopment  to  address  needs  of  intellectual,  social,  and  physical  stimulation.  Community \nleaders usually do not address these either, as child care is typically seen as a responsibility of \nthe parents or extended family. The scale and impact of social services for the very poor \nthrough zakat (compulsory annual deduction for all Muslims in favor of the poor) is very limited. \n \n12.  NGOs. Many NGOs are active on all levels, at the central, provincial, and district levels, \nand several focus on child development. UNICEF is piloting an integrated ECD project in 30 \nvillages in Islamabad Capital Territory and awaits results to continue the intervention on a larger \nscale. NGOs such as the Aga Khan Foundation have an interest in expanding their early \nchildhood education interventions to more comprehensive ECD programs where CBOs have \nbeen established in Sindh and Punjab. The Institute for Development Studies and Practices in \nQuetta provides technical support on capacity building in the social sector through CBOs. Sindh \nEducation Foundation and Institute of Education Development (Aga Khan University) have \nextensive field operations and community experience. NGOs, especially at the grassroots level, \nwill be crucial for any successful implementation of an ECD project. Each province has well-\norganized  NGO  associations  that  may  be  tapped  for  particular  project  activities,  e.g., \ncommunications, training, and field research. The TA team will appraise this option, including \nthe role of the National Commission for Child Welfare and Development and its provincial \ncounterparts. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n13.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  preparing  a  project  to  develop  and  provide \nintegrated ECD service delivery. The TA\u2019s output will be a detailed project proposal including \nverifiable objectives, project activities, implementation arrangements, monitoring, and financing. \nThe primary objective of the project being prepared by the TA is to improve the development \nconditions of children. The specific objectives of the project are to (i) reduce the prevalence of \nunderweight, anemic, and stunted children; (ii) provide integrated service delivery in health, \nnutrition, and early education with community-based initiatives and better child care; and (iii) ", "4 \nestablish a support strategy that will improve the capacity of the local governments and NGOs \nto assist communities in the planning, financing, and monitoring of ECD activities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will carry out a bottom-up feasibility study of the project in selected districts in all \nfour provinces. It will explore alternative project interventions, involving all relevant government \npartners at the district, provincial, and central levels; communities; and target groups, starting \nwith the lower level stakeholders. Special emphasis will be given to communities that have \nalready established CBOs. \n \n15.  More  specifically,  the  TA  will  (i)  conduct  a  situation  analysis  including  all  ongoing \nprojects and activities, especially those financed by other agencies and those supported by the \nGovernment in Pakistan; (ii) identify the best practices in Pakistan and elsewhere; (iii) define the \nscope of the sustainable ECD interventions that help to improve (a) the health and nutrition \nstatus and psychomotor, psychosocial, and cognitive development of young children; and (b) \neducational achievement and learning potential through life; (iv) identify possible partners and \nassess the institutional capacity of local governments, communities, and NGOs to manage and \nfinance integrated ECD initiatives; (v) establish the quantitative framework and estimate costs of \nthe  Project  to  ensure  effective  and  sustainable  systems  for  the  delivery  of  essential  child \nservices; (vi) identify key program components including management and financing systems \nunder the devolution process, programs to improve nutrition and learning ability of children, and \ncaregivers\u2019  knowledge  and  skills;  and  (vii)  identify  suitable  executing  and  implementing \nagencies for the Project. Detailed descriptions of the activities to be carried out during the TA \nare included in the outline terms of reference for consulting services in Appendix 2. \n \n16.  Given the lack of data on ECD, the TA should initiate an extensive baseline and follow-\nup surveys, and provide for regular data collection/monitoring mechanisms. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent of which $335,000 will be \nforeign exchange, and $290,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance $500,000 \nequivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange costs and $165,000 equivalent in local \ncurrency costs. The remaining $125,000 equivalent will be contributed by the Government in \nkind  and  will  include  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff  remuneration,  transportation, \nsurveys, and workshops. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are \nshown in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will employ a process approach. It will focus on the provincial and district levels. \nLocal  communities  and  target  groups  will  be  involved  throughout.  There  will  be  close \ncoordination with other projects financed by ADB, other international agencies, and projects \nsupported by the Government and local NGOs.  \n \n19.  The Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Women Development, Social Welfare and \nSpecial Education (MWDSE). A steering committee will be created with representatives from \nMWDSE,  Economic  Affairs  Division,  Ministry  of  Health,  Ministry  of  Education,  Ministry  of \nPlanning  and  Development,  Ministry  of  Population  Welfare,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the \ngovernments of the four provinces. The steering committee will be headed by MWDSE and will ", "    5 \nensure  that  national  and  local  government-community  partnerships  form  the  basis  for \nproceeding in transparent and accountable fashion. Members of the steering committee will be \nappointed from central and provincial governments. All line agencies, provincial representatives, \nand communities must be involved throughout the planning and implementation. \n \n20.  ECD is a new field of Government services for which an institutional owner has to be \nidentified. The TA will identify the most suitable institutional arrangements for the execution of \nthe ensuing project; agreements will then be made with suitable implementing agencies at \nvarious levels.  \n \n21.  ADB's Devolution Support Program3 and the ongoing Public Resource Management \nProgram Loans4 (North-West Frontier Province and Sindh by World Bank, and Punjab by ADB) \nwill form the basis for future social development initiatives of Government at all three levels \n(federal, provincial, and local) and therefore the TA should take into full consideration these \nimportant ongoing programs. \n \n22.  The TA will be carried out over 6 months, beginning in December of 2002 and ending in \nMay 2003. There will be a total input of 35 person-months of experts, 25 from domestic and 10 \nfrom international experts. The consulting team will include an ECD program specialist (co\u2013\nteam leader, 5 person-months), an early childhood education specialist (3 person-months), and \na  maternal  and  child  nutrition  specialist  (2  person-months)  as  international  consultants. \nDomestic consultants will include a management and institutional development specialist (co-\nteam-leader,  5  person-months),  a  maternal  child  health  specialist  (4  person-months),  four \nprovincial  planning  advisers  (2  person-months  each),  a  social  development  and  social \nmobilization specialist (3 person-months), a poverty impact analyst (2 person-months), and a \nfinancial analyst and program evaluation economist (3 person-months). All consultants will be \nrecruited  through  a  consulting  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The team will be coheaded by an international and a local project specialist (the \nECD specialist and the management and institutional development specialist). \n \n23.  The consultants will submit four major reports: an inception report, no later than 3 weeks \nafter fielding of the consultants; mid-term report, 3 months after TA inception; and a draft final \nreport, 5 months after inception. The Government and ADB will comment on the draft final \nreport. The final report will be submitted within 3 weeks after receiving comments. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for preparing the Early Childhood Development Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n3   ADB.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nSector identified as a National Priority in  Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in  Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?  \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe proposed project will help to reduce poverty by promoting human development among preschool children. \n \nThe project will have several impacts in social and economic terms. It will (i) help to reduce the high economic costs of \nmaternal and child malnutrition in terms of productivity losses, which can be estimated to be at least 3% of gross \ndomestic product annually; (ii) reduce cognitive losses in early childhood, which lead to lifelong losses of learning and \nearning; (iii) reduce costs of health care; and (iv) contribute to higher levels of education in the country through higher \nschool enrollment rates and lower dropout rates, and thus contribute to increased productivity and economic growth. \n \nTo help the Government achieve its human development goals, the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is \ngiving high priority to improving access to health care and early education for children up to 6 years. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification:  Poverty Intervention \n \nThe incidence of poverty in Pakistan increased from 26.6% in fiscal year (FY) 1993 to 32.2% in FY1999 and the \nnumber of poor increased by over 12 million people during this period. Since FY1999, economic growth has slowed \nfurther. Development spending has continued to decline, and it is likely that the incidence of poverty in Pakistan today \nis significantly higher than in FY1999. Poverty rose more sharply in the rural areas in the 1990s, and in FY1999 the \nincidence of rural poverty (36.3%) was significantly higher than urban poverty (22.6%). Inequality also increased in all \nfour provinces, and FY1999 was clearly the most unequal year in all categories. In FY1997, the income share of the \nbottom 20% of households had declined to 6.9% from 7.9% in FY1987, and the income share of the bottom 40% of \nhouseholds declined from 20% to 18%. During the same period, the ratio of the share of the top quintile to that of the \nbottom quintile also increased to 6.5% from 5.2% for all areas. \n \nIn general, the experience of poverty by men and women is different and unequal. It is increasingly evident that \nwomen bear a disproportionately high share of the burden of poverty within the family and the society.  \n \nEducation is the most important factor that distinguishes the poor from the non-poor. For example, the proportion of \nliterate household heads in poor households is almost half that of non-poor households. Poor households on average \nhave 75% more children than the non-poor households. Most of these children are not receiving any education, and \nthus the cycle of poverty is perpetuated. There is a strong correlation between household income and school \nenrollment. \n \nHealth indicators in Pakistan have shown some improvement over the past decade, although they remain lower than \nindicators in other low-income countries. The infant mortality rate is estimated to have declined from 122 per 1000 live \nbirths in FY1991 to 89 per 1000 live births by FY1999 according to the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey (PIHS). \nThe infant mortality rate was 93 per 1000 live births for males and 85 for females, while in urban areas it averaged 73 \nper 1000 live births as opposed to 95 per 1000 live births for rural areas.  \n \nMaternal mortality rates are also very high at about 340\u2013400 per 100,000 births, largely because over 80% of total \nbirths take place at home, under the care of traditional birth attendants. Less than a third of expectant mothers \ntypically go for prenatal checks, and this rate falls to barely a tenth for postnatal consultations.  \n \nThe PIHS for 1997\u20131998 reports some improvement in the total fertility rate, which had declined from 6.8 births per \nwoman in the mid 1980s to about 5 births per woman by 1997. Once again, the bulk of the reduction appeared to have \ntaken place in urban areas, and has been largely attributed to an increase in the use of contraceptives. The \ncontraceptive prevalence rate is estimated to be about 29% for urban areas, one of the lowest in Asia. \n \nFull immunization rates increased from 45% to 49% based on recall measures; however, these fell considerably short \nof the 90% coverage targeted for 1998. Overall, the gender gap in this area was eliminated by FY1997, but \nreappeared in FY1999, when the difference in immunization between males and females was 7%. The rural/urban gap \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nnarrowed from 9% to 6% over this time. The PIHS 1998\u20131999 data show a strong correlation between income and \nimmunization as approximately three-quarters of children in the upper income quintile are fully immunized, but only \none quarter are immunized in the bottom quintile.  \n \nThree factors \u2014 communicable infectious diseases, reproductive health problems, and nutritional deficiencies \u2014\naccount for almost 60% of the burden of disease in Pakistan, when measured in terms of life-years lost. All of these \nare preventable or easily treatable problems, but the quality of health services is so inadequate that the incidence of \nsuch diseases remains high, and mortality rates remain high. An estimated 70% of all health facilities are in urban \nareas, and 70% of the national public health budget is spent on the construction and maintenance of hospital facilities, \nwhile primary health care is under-financed. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder Analysis  \n \nThe TA was developed through extensive consultation with central and local governments and stakeholders. To \nensure local ownership of the project and the measures to be identified and subsequently carried out through the \nensuing loan, the process of consulting with civil society and engaging all stakeholders in the development of the \nproject must be continued. The TA will develop a strategy to define the participation of all stakeholders and determine \ntheir role and level of participation. This includes the role of the relevant ministries, local governance structures, and \ncommunity-based organizations such as women\u2019s groups as project effectiveness will depend, to a large extent, on \nthe participation of women. Special efforts may be needed to engage poor women in the process. The TA will have to \nexamine gender issues to make sure that women are fully involved in the project. For any community-driven \ncomponents of the ensuing project loan, the participation process will be defined through the TA. \n \nParticipation Strategy Required:  No \n \nD.
