The rationale for this program also stems from the fact that the country \nwill  soon  have  a  federal  form  of  government  in  which  subnational \ngovernments will play major roles in local development. Thus, strengthening \nlocal governance is a must. Finally, the present context in Nepal demands \nreforms in local governance and community development  that are medium \nto long term, which justifies the program cluster approach of the GSP. \n \nThe  GSP  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  on  devolution  and \nsubnational governance and contributes directly to desired outcomes in local \ngovernance and community development.  \n   \nProgram  The  proposed  program  cluster  for  supporting  local  governance  and \nCluster  community  development  in  Nepal  will  offer  phased  assistance  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  short-  to  medium-term  reform  plans  in  this  sector.  The ", "ii   \nexpected impact of the GSP will be social and economic transformation in \nNepal through (i) capable and accountable government at all levels that \nprovides effective and inclusive services, and (ii) empowered communities \nthat  engage  actively  with  government  to  hold  it  accountable.  ADB  will \ndevelop two subprograms to support the attainment of these outcomes. \n \nSubprogram I (SP1) (2008\u20132012) will emphasize community mobilization \nand  strengthening  to  hold  local  bodies  accountable,  strengthening  their \ncapability to provide effective and inclusive services and instituting relevant \nprotocols  and  systems  in  the  central  Government  to  support  the  local \ngovernance  reform  agenda.  Subprogram  II  (SP2)  (2012\u20132015)  will \nconcentrate on the business process reengineering needed at the center to \nsupport a federal government structure, putting in place the legal framework \nfor proper local governance, strengthening the fiscal transfer process and \nsystem, and then strengthening community organizations and local bodies. \n   \nSubprogram I   \nGrant \n   \nImpact and  SP1  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  national  Local  Governance  and \nOutcomes  Community Development Program (LGCDP), which will contribute to poverty \nreduction through inclusive, responsive, and accountable local governance \nand  participatory,  community-led  development.  There  are  three  main \noutcomes that SP1 will contribute to through its support to the LGCDP: (i) \ncitizens and communities engage actively with local bodies and hold them \naccountable; (ii) better management of resources and delivery of services in \nan  inclusive  and  equitable  manner  by  capable  local  bodies;  and  (iii) \nstrengthened policy and national institutional frameworks, including legal \nframeworks, for decentralization, devolution, and community development.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  SP1 will finance a portion of the expenses for the LGCDP, whose total costs \nare approximately $470.0 million. ADB will finance $106.3 million of these \ncosts,  the  Government  will  provide  $260.8  million,  and  the  rest  will  be \nfinanced  through  assistance  from  other  development  partners  that  have \nexpressed their commitment of support through a signed letter of intent. \n   \nAmount and  It is proposed that the ADB support the Government\u2019s efforts to reform local \nTerms  governance and community development by providing a program grant of \n$106.3 million for SP1 from its Special Funds resources. The recipient will \nbe the Government of Nepal. The grant proceeds are expected to be utilized \nfor 48 months from the date of effectiveness. \n   \nSubprogram I  The grant will be provided in three tranches. The first tranche, not exceeding \nPeriod and  $20.0  million,  will  be  disbursed  upon  grant  effectiveness.  The  second \nTranching  tranche, not exceeding $45.0 million, will be disbursed upon finalization of \nthe  joint  financing  arrangement  (JFA)  between  the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners for the LGCDP and will be subject to the Government \nfulfilling all second tranche release requirements. The third tranche, not \nexceeding $41.3 million, will be disbursed within 12 months after the second \ntranche and upon satisfactory fulfillment of all corresponding tranche release \nrequirements. ", "  iii\nExecuting  The  Ministry  of  Local  Development  (MLD)  is  the  Executing  Agency. \nAgency and  Implementing agencies include the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction for \nImplementation  work related to the local peace committees and such participating local \nArrangements  bodies  as  district  development  committees,  village  development \ncommittees, and municipalities. Civil society organizations and private firms \nwill implement parts of the GSP that are outsourced by local bodies. A \nnational advisory committee at the center has been established for overall \ncoordination, policy advocacy, and supervision of the LGCDP. A program \ncoordination unit in MLD is responsible for the day-to-day coordination of \nGSP work nationally. Local development officers will coordinate the program \nin districts, as will executive officers in municipalities and secretaries in \nvillage development committees. \n \nIn the initial stages of SP1, the JFA will be prepared by the Government and \nparticipating development partners to guide implementation arrangements \nfor the LGCDP. \n   \nProcurement  The proceeds of the SP1 grant will finance the full foreign exchange costs, \nand  excluding local duties and taxes, of items produced and procured in ADB \nDisbursement  member countries other than items specified in the list of ineligible items in \nAppendix  8  and  imports  financed  from  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loan, the \nproceeds of the SP1 grant will be disbursed to the Federal Democratic \nRepublic of Nepal as the Grant Recipient. The Grant Recipient will certify \nthat the volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected \ndisbursement under the SP1 grant for the given period. ADB reserves the \nright to audit the use of grant proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Grant \nRecipient\u2019s certification. \n   \nCounterpart  The local currency funds generated from the proceeds of the grant will be \nFunds  used by the Government to strictly implement the sector reforms specified in \nthe LGCDP document. \n   \nBenefits and  The SP1 grant will support LGCDP improvements in the effectiveness of \nBeneficiaries  local service delivery through strong local bodies and engaged and strong \ncommunity organizations. In the medium term, this is expected to bring good \nlocal  governance  and,  ultimately,  inclusive  development.  Beneficiaries \ninclude  local  government  administrations,  community  organizations, \nwomen\u2019s and disadvantaged groups, midlevel agencies such as local body \nassociations  and  regional  training  centers,  and  central  Government \nagencies. Local service recipients and citizens will also benefit from SP1. \n   \nRisks and  The main assumptions for SP1 are that (i) the elected Government will \nMitigating  remain  committed  to  reforms  in  local  governance,  as  evidenced  in  the \nMeasures  LGCDP, and the process of making Nepal a federal republic will proceed \nsmoothly; (ii) development partners remain engaged, as will be reflected in \ntheir continued presence in the JFA when it is prepared; (iii) the political \nsystem  will  be  stable  during  subprogram  implementation;  and  (iv)  the \ncountry\u2019s  intergovernmental  fiscal  arrangements  and  public  financial \nmanagement systems are fairly robust.  \n ", "iv   \n  Risks that may occur are mitigated by (i) the presence of political consensus \nacross all parties on the move toward a federal structure, and (ii) the intent \nof a range of development partners to support the LGCDP, as confirmed in \nthe letter of intent. The fiduciary risks identified in the 2007 assessment of \npublic expenditure and financial accountability have been responded to in \nthe  form  of  an  action  plan  currently  being  prioritized  by  the  Financial \nComptroller General\u2019s Office and expected to be available by end-2008. The \nresulting public financial management reform agenda is likely to include (i) \nadjustments to the budget classification system to bring it fully in line with \ninternational government financial statistics standards, (ii) support to the \nOffice  of  the  Auditor  General,  and  (iii)  refinements  to  the  existing \ncomputerized  financial  information  system.  The  prioritized  action  plan \nprovides  a  platform  upon  which  to  base  a  coherent  approach  to  public \nfinancial  management  reforms.  Fiduciary  risk  mitigation  for  local \ngovernments is provided through the extensive due diligence constraints of \nthe performance-based funding modality that will be rolled out under the \nLGCDP. \n \nAdditional mitigating measures include instituting public and social audits \nwidely so that the public has access to information necessary to monitor the \nperformance of local bodies. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster to the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal for the Governance Support \nProgram (GSP), comprising two subprograms, and (ii) a proposed grant for subprogram 1 of the \nGSP. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \nA.  Economic Assessment and Outlook \n2.  Between 2005 and 2007, economic growth in Nepal averaged only 2.8% per annum, \nwell short of even the pessimistic scenario of the tenth plan, which had targeted 4.3%.2 The \ngrowth of the gross domestic product (GDP) steadily slowed from 3.1% in fiscal year (FY) 2005 \nto 2.8% in FY2006 and 2.5% in FY2007. In the current fiscal year, however, the economy grew \nat  5.6%,  propelled  by  strong  growth  in  agriculture  and  other  sectors.  This  is  the  fastest \neconomic expansion in the past 7 years. The service sector, particularly tourism, has performed \nbetter than expected, but industrial growth has stagnated. The country\u2019s per capita income now \nstands at $470. \n  \n3.  Fairly sound macroeconomic policies have helped preserve macroeconomic stability \nduring this period. With the resolution of the internal conflict, the Government of Nepal (the \nGovernment) adopted an increasingly expansionary fiscal policy,3 but strong tax administration \nand sustained donor assistance were sufficient to mitigate the adverse effects of this policy. \nInflationary  pressures  exist  nevertheless.  While  the  rate  of  inflation  averaged  6.3%  during \nFY2005\u2013FY2007,  by  mid-May  2008  it  had  reached  9.2%.  Still,  sustained  current  account \nsurpluses  and  aid-related  capital  inflows  have  facilitated  continued  balance  of  payments \nsurpluses.4 Remittance inflows have emerged as the major source of foreign exchange earnings, \nwhile merchandise exports have stagnated.  \n \n4.  Economic growth is expected to be around 4% per annum in the coming year, but \nindustrial growth is likely to be constrained by fuel and power shortages, continued political \nuncertainty, and structural weaknesses in the economy. Macroeconomic stability in the period \nahead will depend largely on a continued prudent policy stance, particularly in addressing \nemerging challenges posed by new fiscal pressures from the peace process, including those \nrelated to Government commitments resulting from various political compromises; higher food \nand fuel prices; and chronic fuel and power shortages. \n \nB.  Status of Spatial Poverty Reduction \n5.  The Nepal Living Standards Survey in 2003/04 showed the poverty incidence declining \nsharply from 42% in 1996 to 31% in 2004, driven by growth in per capita consumption and \nincome,  each  averaging  4.5%  per  annum.  Nepal  may  have  made  progress  in  human\n                                                 \n1  This analysis is drawn largely from the Asian Development Bank Country Partnership Strategy Mid-Term Review \nfor Nepal in June 2008. \n2  The tenth plan had envisaged two economic growth scenarios: (i) 6.2% based on an expected improvement in the \nsecurity situation, and (ii) 4.3% assuming continuation of the conflict. \n3  The Government doubled the budget deficit after grants from less than 1% of GDP in FY2004 to 2% in FY2007. \n4  However, the current account surplus weakened to 0.5% of GDP in FY2007 from over 2% in earlier years, due to a \nwidening trade deficit. ", "2     \ndevelopment,5 but the spatial incidence of poverty and depravation is a cause for rising concern. \nThe country continues to have stark and widening socioeconomic disparities. The Nepal Living \nStandards Survey shows that income inequality increased significantly, with the Gini Coefficient \nrising from 34.2% in 1996 to 41.1% in 2004. Further, the 11 percentage point drop in poverty \nwas unevenly distributed geographically and across caste, ethnic, and minority groups. Poverty \nlevels are still high in rural areas, especially in the Midwestern region (45%) and Farwestern \nregion (41%). Poverty is much worse among lower caste and minority groups, such as Dalits, \nhill Janajatis, and Muslims (all above 40%), than in upper caste groups such as Brahmins and \nChettris (19%) and Newars (14%). Gender disparities are stark, as women lag far behind men in \nall spheres of life despite efforts to improve equality.6  \n \n6.  This untenable situation has to be seen in the context of the political changes that have \nbeen the hallmark of Nepali life in recent years. For particular political parties, the economic \nstraitjacket is juxtaposed with the need for dramatic and fundamental political reforms. Now that \nthe country has moved from having a monarchy to being a federal democratic republic, and now \nthat there is an elected government in place, a new economic model may well evolve that will \nseek to fundamentally realign the political economy of the country. \n \n7.  The  main  tasks  facing  Nepal  at  present  are  (i)  formulating  a  new  constitution  that \nformalizes the recent political changes in the country; (ii) restructuring the state, including \ntranslating the vision of federalism into a more practical reality, while engendering public trust in \ngovernment and, in the process, giving a peace dividend to the people; (iii) reenergizing the \neconomy to capitalize on the more favorable political situation; and (iv) providing services in an \ninclusive manner so that the numerous disadvantaged groups (DAGs) can enter the economic \nand political mainstream of national life. \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR7 \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n1.  Political Context \n \n8.  After  multiparty  democracy  was  introduced  in  1990,  the  political  situation  in  Nepal \ndisplayed dual tendencies toward a lack of credibility in political parties, which were rendered \nineffective  largely  by  their  constant  bickering  among  one  another,  and  the  continued \nmarginalization of large segments of the population. In the mid-1990s, the Communist Party of \n                                                 \n5  The child mortality rate declined from 91 per 1,000 live births in 2001 to 48 in FY2006/07, the mortality rate for \ninfants below 1 year fell from 64 to 34 in the same period, and the maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births fell \nfrom 539 to 281 over the last decade. From 2001 to 2006, the adult literacy rate improved from 43% to 52%, \nprimary school net enrollment increased from 80% to 87%, and the proportion of the population with access to \nimproved water supply increased from 72% to 77% and with improved sanitation from 28% to 46%. These are \nimpressive  numbers,  particularly  as  conflict  existed  in  Nepal  for  more  than  a  decade  (National  Planning \nCommission, 2007. Three Year Interim Plan (2007/08-2009/10). Kathmandu (December)). \n6  The gender-related development index (GDI) and gender empowerment measure for Nepal have not moved up \nsignificantly, currently at 0.391 and 0.452 respectively (National Human Development Report, 2004). However, \nconsiderable disparities in both indices exist both within and across geographic regions. According to the National \nPlanning Commission (2007), the GDI value is higher in urban areas (0.562) than in rural areas (0.430) and in the \nhills (0.973) than in the terai (0.943) or in the mountains (0.941). The assessment of the tenth plan indicates that \nthe decline in poverty in the past decade has not been even for different groups and regions. Women in general\u2014\n \nand women from the Midwestern and Farwestern regions in particular\u2014remain excluded from access to services \nand economic opportunities. \n7  Taken to mean local governance and community development, which encompasses, inter alia, decentralization \nand devolution, intergovernmental fiscal transfers, local administration, and community action for development. It \nexcludes governance components such as the electoral system, human rights, police reforms, or political party \nreforms. Appendix 2 contains a more detailed sector analysis. \n ", "    3 \nNepal  (Maoist)  (CPN[M])  splintered  from  the  core  alliance  of  leftist  parties  and  initiated  a \n\u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d against what it termed the feudal state. In the decade-old conflict, 11,715 people \nwere reported killed and 19,000 displaced.8 Physical losses have been estimated at Rs5 billion \n(approximately $68 million), not to mention the untold misery and agony of thousands of people \naffected by the conflict. In February 2005, the King took over the reins of power with a promise \nto steady the political situation and resolve the matter of the insurgency. His attempts failed, \nhowever.  A  mere  14  months  after  his  takeover,  all  the  political  parties\u2014in  alliance  with \nCPN(M)\u2014united to force the King\u2019s hand to reinstate Parliament, and soon the decade-long \nconflict came to an end. \n \n9.  Since then, political governance has been characterized by attempts to steer the country \ntoward a different political landscape. At the core of this is the consensus among political parties \nto  move  the  country  toward  a  federal  state  based  on  a  new  constitution  drafted  by  the \nConstituent Assembly, the elections for which were held in April 2008 after two postponements. \n \n10.  The  Constituent  Assembly  elections  were  generally  peaceful  and  orderly,  with  a \nreasonably high voter turnout of 61%, reflecting the Nepali people\u2019s aspiration for lasting peace \nand stability. In what came as a surprise to many, CPN(M) won the largest number of seats \nunder both the first-past-the-post and the proportional representation electoral systems.9 In May \n2008, the Constituent Assembly, in its first session, formally declared Nepal to be a federal \ndemocratic republic, thus ending the almost two-and-half-century reign of the Shah dynasty. \nThe  Constituent  Assembly  itself  is  more  inclusive  of  historically  marginalized  groups  than \nprevious legislatures,10 and this augurs well for the process of preparing the constitution. \n \n11.  These have been significant achievements in the political process in Nepal in the past \ncouple of years, but much more still remains to be done. Of particular importance will be the \nprocess of restructuring the state with a federal structure of government. This process is fraught \nwith  challenges  but  is  the  single  political  measure  that  will  have  the  most  momentous \nimplications  for  how  development  space  is  structured  in  the  country  (see  Supplementary \nAppendix C on the issues related to federalism in Nepal).  \n \n12.  While all political parties have agreed on the transition toward a federal structure for the \ncountry, as reflected in the Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP), \nlittle  agreement  yet  exists  among  them  on  exactly  how  this  should  play  out,  and  the \ndisagreements are not always clearly articulated at this stage. While the Constituent Assembly \nhas yet to discuss this in earnest, there is a need to be mindful of local governance implications \nof the various ideas on federalism currently being aired (see Supplementary Appendix C). What \nis  not  contested  are  the  three  principles  under  the  LGCDP:  a  strengthened  national  and \ninstitutional framework; the need for strong local bodies capable of delivering services in an \neffective and socially inclusive manner; and the need for empowered local communities.  \n \n2.  Local Governance Context \n \n13.  Local governance was until 1990 always dominated by a focus more on administrative \nconsiderations than on political or economic autonomy, and very little political space was given \n                                                 \n8  Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction, cited in The Himalayan Times. 2008. Miseries continue to dog thousands of \nconflict-hit. 8 May (Kathmandu, page 1).  \n9  CPN(M) won 220 seats in total, followed by Nepal Congress with 110, Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-\nLeninist) with 103, Madhes People\u2019s Right Forum with 52, and other smaller parties with 90. The remaining 26 \nseats for the 601-member Constituent Assembly were nominated by the interim Government in June 2008. \n10 The Constituent Assembly Member Electoral Act 2007 allocated special seats to women and DAGs as follows: \nDalits 13%, indigenous groups 37.8%, backward regions 4%, Madhesis 31.2%, and other groups 30.2%. Males \nand females equally shared each of these quotas.  \n ", "4     \nto  local  governments.  This  changed  with  the  constitution  of  1990,  and  since  then  (and \nparticularly after the legal framework provided by the Local Self-Governance Act in 1999 and \nthe Interim Constitution of 2007 that provided priority to local self-governance and equity-based \nresource  allocation),  local  governance  reforms  have  been  debated  in  the  same  breath  as \noverarching, national political reforms. \n \n14.  At the moment, the administrative divisions in place for the past 4 decades persist. In \nthis set up, there are 75 districts (each comprising 9\u201317 ilakas\u2014or areas that cover clusters of \nvillages and municipalities\u2014and varying in terms of geographical characteristics and, more \nimportantly, economic endowment),11 3,915 village development committees (each with nine \nwards that contain several settlements or communities),12 and 58 municipalities with anywhere \nfrom 9 to 35 wards. For law and order purposes, the country was divided into 14 zones, but this \ndemarcation does not currently hold any administrative or economic significance. The districts \nand villages are coalesced into development committees that have parallel development and \nadministrative areas of focus. \n \n15.  Nepal has not had local elections since 2002, which means that there are no local \nelected representatives. This has myriad consequences, the most significant of which is that \nlocal administrations run by bureaucrats deputed from the central government13 have very little \ndownward accountability even though they are supported by an all-party alliance at the local \nlevel. This has hindered local stakeholder ownership of the development process. \n \n16.  Recognizing the variance in socioeconomic status among the districts, and largely to \nascertain the nature and extent of marginalization across them, the Government is conducting a \nDAG mapping exercise in 70 of the country\u2019s 75 districts, with surveys in the remaining five to \nbe  completed  in  the  near  future.14 The  DAG  mapping  exercise  has  revealed  significant \ndepravation among districts.  \n \n17.  A primary feature of the state of local governance in Nepal is that ordinary citizens, and \nin particular DAGs, have been unable to participate effectively in the local political economy and \nhave failed to hold local bodies15 accountable for their performance. This lack of accountability \nis at the core of the program that has been designed by the Government. \n \n3.  Legal and Policy Environment for Decentralization and Local Governance \n \n18.  The legal and policy environment for decentralization and local governance in Nepal has \nundergone a substantial shift in the past 2 decades, as considered from these perspectives: \n \n                                                 \n11 The Ministry of Local Development estimates that Kathmandu District alone collects 40% of all revenue in the \ncountry; Parsa District, which handles much of Nepal\u2019s overland imports from India, collects another 20%; and 64 \nof the 75 districts in the country together collect only 14%. The remaining nine districts collect the residual 26%. \n12 These have various community-based organizations that are characterized by localized membership, small size, \nand self-help orientation. They increasingly provide local services on contract with local governments.  \n13 This includes executive officers in municipalities, local development officers in district development committees, \nand secretaries in village development committees. \n14 Criteria used in DAG mapping to find out who the DAGs are and how they are disadvantaged include food \nsufficiency in the past 3 months, access to primary school and health posts, participation in planning and decision-\nmaking forums, and the prevalence of gender discrimination. DAG mapping is used by policy makers to determine \nthe extent of additional support needed to uplift the marginalized and vulnerable groups in a particular area. \n15 This document distinguishes between local governments and local bodies. As there are currently no local elected \nrepresentatives, the term \u201clocal bodies\u201d is used. The Local Self-Governance Act, 1999, uses the term \u201clocal bodies\u201d \nto refer to all village and district development committees and municipalities. \n ", "    5 \n(i)  Constitutional. The Interim Constitution of 2007 specifies that decentralization is \nthe cornerstone of national development.16 It says that a conducive environment \nwill be created to promote grassroots participation. The fifth amendment to this \nConstitution  allows  for  creating  interim  local  bodies  representing  all  political \nparties in the Constituent Assembly until local elections are held. \n(ii)  Legal. The legal basis17 for the policy environment is contained in the (a) Local \nSelf-Governance Act, 1999,18 which, though rather dated, continues to serve as \nthe fundamental legal basis for local governance and the primary institutional \nfoundation for local bodies; (b) Local Bodies Financial Administration Regulations, \n2007, which are designed to strengthen the financial authority of local bodies, \nimprove  transparency  through  the  provision  of  community  procurement  and \npublic  audit,  and  enhance  the  accountability  of  local  bodies;  (c)  Right  to \nInformation Act, 2007, which helps strengthen accountability and transparency in \ngovernment, including at the local level; and (d) Governance (Management and \nOperation) Act, 2008, which focuses on good governance principles and norms \n(including fiscal discipline), aligns civic rights to good governance, delineates the \nfunctions and responsibilities of officials at different levels of government, and \nlegally provides for transforming the role of government administration toward \nthat of a service provider. \n(iii)  Institutional. The Local Bodies Fiscal Commission, created in 2002, plays a \ncentral institutional role with respect to intergovernmental fiscal transfers related \nto  local  bodies.  Other  relevant  institutions  include  the  National  Planning \nCommission, the Ministry of Finance, and local body associations. \n(iv)  Planning.  The  current  Three-Year  Interim  Plan  (TYIP)  (FY2008\u20132010)  lays \nemphasis  on  economic  backing  to  the  political  vision  of  devolved  local \ngovernance. The TYIP specifies decentralization as a main means of enhancing \ngood governance; details a process of administrative, political, social, economic, \nand development works; and presents a strategy for promoting the peoples\u2019 \nparticipation and empowerment. The 2007 Concept Paper on Self-Governance \nand Local Development from the Ministry of Local Development (MLD) effectively \ndefines the strategic direction for local governance in Nepal. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n1.  Issues \n19.  Engineering a New Paradigm of Central\u2013Local Relations. It is clear that the center \nwill  play  a  strong  policy  coordinating,  facilitating,  and  monitoring  role  on  most  matters  of \ngovernance. This requires that embedded approaches to engaging local bodies undergo a \nsubstantive shift. This is what the federalism debate in Nepal now centers on. The Local Self-\nGovernance Act (LSGA) is still the basic legal provision for local governance, but this piece of \nlegislation, crafted almost a decade ago, does not reflect the political reality of 2008. \n                                                 \n16 It sets the future direction for the social, political, and economic transformation of Nepal by guaranteeing social \njustice and affirmative action for women and DAGs. It proposes the future restructuring of the state to promote and \ninstitutionalize  an  inclusive,  democratic,  and  progressive  local  governance  system,  maximizing  people's \nparticipation through decentralization, devolution of power, and the equitable distribution of resources to local \nbodies. The Interim Constitution provides for creating such interim local bodies as municipalities and village and \ndistrict development committees as per political consensus.  \n17 Relevant here are the rather innovative aspects of social inclusion and gender equality that are now being included \nin various pieces of legislation, rules, and procedures, as well as in development programs. \n18 Supplementary Appendix B discusses this in detail. \n ", "6     \n20.  Ensuring a Peace Dividend. Providing citizens, and particularly DAGs, with a peace \ndividend  and  earning  greater  trust  in  Government  is  currently  the main  challenge.  This  is \nimportant to heal damaged social relations quickly and recoup the development momentum lost \nto the conflict through programs of reconstruction, rehabilitation, and reintegration, as well as \nthe effective delivery of basic services. This last point is crucial, for it goes to the heart of \ninteraction between government and citizens. The current state of public service delivery is \nconsidered  weak,  with  the  possible  exception  of  some  aspects  of  delivery  of  health  and \neducation services following sectoral devolution.19 Unless such service delivery is improved, \ngovernment\u2013citizen interactions will continue to be weak, and efforts to gain greater public trust \nin government will not yield a peace dividend. \n21.  Improving  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Transfers  and  Funds  Flow.  To  make  local \ninvestments  more  responsive  to  community  needs,  the  Government  will  increase  the \ndiscretionary block grant that is currently transferred to local bodies. The defining feature of this \nexpanded block grant (EBG) is that its actual allocation is never an entitlement but subject to \ncompliance with specified minimum eligibility conditions and further set in accordance with an \nannual performance assessment\u2014a minimum conditions and performance measures (MCPM) \nsystem.20 The actual size of the EBG is thus adapted to proven institutional capacity in key \nfunctional  areas,  mainly  relating  to  public  financial  management,  and  so  provides  fiscal \nincentives for compliance with the existing legal and regulatory framework that guides the \noperations of local bodies. This makes the EBG and the MCPM system the first systematic and \nnationwide approach to promoting good governance and needs-based local service delivery.21 A \nsecond salient feature of the EBG is that its basic allocation is based on a clear, transparent, \nand poverty-focused formula. This positively distinguishes the EBG from the vast majority of \nconditional grants that flow to the districts, which are not formula based and thus are open to \nunwarranted discretion in their allocation.  \n22.  Instituting a Workable Local Government Service. What passes for local government \nservice  at  the  moment  is  still  controlled  by  the  center  through  resource  flow  and  human \nresource management. Given that, a particular issue that the Government will need to consider \nurgently is how to institute a local government service such that local bodies will not have to rely \nexcessively on the center for human resource systems. Despite the fact that representatives of \npolitical parties, in conjunction with officers deputed from the center to local bodies, manage \nlocal body operations, putting in place a workable local government service is critical. \n23.  Providing Services Effectively and Inclusively. One of the root causes of the conflict \nin Nepal was the glaring failure of the public sector to provide services, especially local ones, \neffectively  and  inclusively.  The  recent  inability  of  the  Government  to  provide  textbooks  to \nstudents is one glaring example of this failure. Across the board, DAGs, and women in particular, \nhave been marginalized regarding access to services as their right, and this has fed wariness \ntoward government.22 \n                                                 \n19 An assessment done by ADB has found that in several districts local school management committees have been \nsomewhat successful in getting better services from schools (the assessment work was done under ADB. 2006. \nTechnical Assistance to Nepal for Preparing the Governance Reforms and Decentralization Cluster Program I. \nManila (TA 4834-NEP, approved 31 August)). For further analysis of service delivery issues, see Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n20 Details on the MCPM system and the EBG are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n21 Component 2 of the LGCDP is a nationwide roll out of the MCPM pilot, which has been successfully tried in 25 \ndistricts since FY2005. The Government decided to introduce the system for all local bodies. \n22 Service delivery experiences across such sectors as water supply and sanitation, education, health, urban service \ndelivery, etc., generally reveal that the Government has not managed to keep pace with public demand for \nservices.  This  service  delivery  deficit  is  particularly  severe  with  respect  to  DAGs,  who,  because  of  caste \ndiscrimination and social exclusion, cannot access basic services even when generally available. \n ", "    7 \n24.  Holding  Local  Bodies  Accountable  to  Communities.  This  issue  has  to  do  with \nstrengthening demand for good local governance and has several facets: \n(i)  With no elected local representatives, civil servants deputed from the center run \nlocal administrations, so local bodies exhibit very little downward accountability to \ncitizens. An all-party mechanism exists at every level to help the bureaucracy \nfunction, but this cannot substitute for direct accountability to citizens. \n(ii)  While the all-party mechanism is expected to give guidance on local governance \nmatters until local elections take place, there are vestiges of political meddling in \nlocal service delivery. This has not diminished, even with the far-reaching political \nchanges in the country.  \n(iii)  Some communities have historically not been able to participate in the public \naccountability process. Making local bodies more sensitive to the needs and \nvoices of children, women, and DAGs is very challenging. The country has a \nhighly stratified society in which women and the underprivileged exert very little \npower and find it difficult to articulate their needs. \n(iv)  Challenges remain as to how to adapt social mobilization activities in a manner \nthat allows broad-based and targeted community interaction with local bodies \nand promotes downward accountability.  \n \n2.  Opportunities \n \n25.  There are several opportunities to bring about substantial and far-reaching reforms at \nthe moment, made more accessible to policy makers by the movement toward federalism. They \ninclude the following: \n(i)  Commitment  of  major  political  parties.  Everyone  strongly  realizes  the \nunderlying cause of the conflict was the marginalization of vast segments of the \npopulation. Recent years have seen a commitment on the part of all political \nparties to pay more attention to this. The political realignment evident in Nepal in \nrecent years has contributed to this opportunity. The major political parties have \nexpressed active commitment to state restructuring to ensure a decentralized, \naccountable, people-oriented, and democratic self-governance system, as well \nas to address the needs of DAGs and remote regions and communities. \n(ii)  New  realignment  of  the  state.  Realignment  following  the  abolition  of  the \nmonarchy and the move toward a federal state better reflect the aspirations of all. \nThe formation of local peace committees in 32 districts so far, with their provision \nof an all-party mechanism and the representation of women and DAGs, provides \nsignificant opportunities to improve linkages with the local administration to help \narbitrate in conflicts that impede development efforts. The state realignment is \nalso evidenced in, for example, the second amendment in 2007 to the Civil \nService Act, 1992, which reserves 45% of positions for women and excluded \ngroups, and a declaration by the Interim Parliament for 33% representation for \nwomen in all state institutions. \n(iii)  Commitment to increased fiscal transfers to local bodies. The Government \nis committed to increasing fiscal transfers to local bodies. In 2006, it increased \nthe size of village development committee (VDC) block grants from NRs500,000 \nto  NRs1  million  (in  September  2008,  this  was  doubled  to  NRs2  million). \nIncreased fiscal transfers from the center provide opportunities to strengthen and \nimprove the quality of local infrastructure and service delivery and to empower \nthe  community.  Similarly,  the  Government  is  moving  ahead  to  consider  the \nperformance-based allocation of resources to district development committees \n(DDCs) and other local bodies as a basic measure to improve good governance. \n ", "8     \n(iv)  Increased  demand  for  stronger  local  governance.  Demand  for  good \ngovernance in Nepal has now been fuelled by an active media and civil society. \nThere is increasing acceptance of such tools as citizens\u2019 charters, codes of \nconduct, social audits, citizen report cards, sunshine provisions, etc., and this \nhas helped fuel demand for stronger local governance.23This provides substantial \nopportunities  to  strengthen  transparent  and  accountable  local  governance.24 \nPublic demand has been evident in calls to redefine the relationship between \nlocal administrations and local communities and to promote more constructive \ninteraction between them. \n(v)  Harmonized approach of development partners. Development partners have \ncome together substantively to work with the Government and support reforms in \nlocal governance and community development. This is evident in the manner in \nwhich they have expressed their joint support to the LGCDP. This provides an \nopportunity to pool resources and learn directly from different experiences. \n \n3.  Government Strategy \n \n26.  Picking up from the policy environment for decentralization and local governance, the \nGovernment\u2019s long-term vision on local governance and decentralization is to have local bodies \nrestructured according to the concepts of inclusion, democracy, and a federal governmental \nsystem capable of effectively delivering services. This means a focus on two specific things: \nlocal governance and service delivery. In the TYIP, the Government specifies two objectives to \nattain  its  vision:  (i)  promoting  good  local  governance  by  clearly  delineating  the  rights and \nresponsibilities  of  the  central  Government  and  local  bodies,  and  (ii)  enhancing  local  body \neffectiveness by developing a participatory planning system based on peoples\u2019 aspirations and \nlocal demand through inclusion and mainstreaming gender. \n \n27.  The Government\u2019s strategy to meet these objectives is to do the following:  \n(i)  Restructure local bodies on the basis of geography, population, resources and \nmeans, and service delivery.  \n(ii)  Limit the functions of the central Government to policy formulation, setting norms \nand quality standards, human resource development, etc., and devolve the rest \nto local bodies. \n(iii)  Implement the Local (Government) Service Act to ensure that local civil service is \nstrengthened. \n(iv)  Directly transfer funds to local bodies through the Ministry of Finance to district \ndevelopment funds, municipality funds, and, through DDCs, to VDCs. \n(v)  Formulate and implement human resource development plans in areas related to \nlocal governance. \n(vi)  Encourage the mobilization and sharing of revenues between local bodies. \n(vii)  Put in place a \u201cone window\u201d system so that local bodies can hold to account all \ndevelopment partners, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and others that \nprovide funding. \n(viii)  Encourage a rights-based approach to formulating and implementing local plans \nand programs. \n                                                 \n23 MLD reports that the results of some of its surveys show substantial utility in applying these tools more extensively. \nThe experiences of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) in the field in Nepal show that public \nand social auditing gives voice to DAGs and helps improve operational transparency and accountability. Its \nexperiences show that such tools have been useful in empowering DAGs and improving downward accountability. \n(CIDA\u2019s notes on lessons learned from its field operations are available from the Mission.) \n24 There is a clear distinction between strengthening local governance and a generic focus on decentralization \nreforms. The former is much more encompassing and brings to the fore the relationship of local governments with \nthe communities they serve. Decentralization reforms are not as extensive. \n ", "    9 \n \n28.  The TYIP focuses on the Government\u2019s strategy with respect to good local governance. \nThis  centers  on  promoting  access  to  economic  and  social  service  delivery  through  public \nparticipation, transparency, accountability, and the creation of a corruption-free environment. \nOne particular strategy that the Government wishes to pursue in this respect is to reiterate the \nfundamental rights of the client to receive effective and quality service by making service \ndelivery that is provided by all government agencies inclusive. Another is to encourage a greater \nrole for NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) in social mobilization. \n \n29.  The Government strategy with respect to service delivery as part of good governance \nrests on the following: \n(i)  Minimize corruption by strengthening institutions such as the National Vigilance \nCenter and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority. \n(ii)  Transfer local services to local bodies. \n(iii)  Continue  to  emphasize  citizens\u2019  charters  and  public  hearings  and  give  civil \nsociety a greater monitoring role largely through a more comprehensive social \nmobilization policy. \n(iv)  Disseminate  information  more  effectively  by,  for  example,  computerizing  all \ninformation  in  public  agencies  involved  in  service  delivery  and  enhanced \ncommunication among service providers. \n(v)  Make available to the public all information on services delivered by the state. \n(vi)  Give  greater  authority  to  institutions  that  deliver  services  and  equip  them \nadequately. \n(vii)  Place greater emphasis on consumer rights. \n \n30.  All of this is contained in the LGCDP, which the Government has developed, owns, and \nis fully committed to. The LGCDP seeks to meet the TYIP goals of socially inclusive and \ngender-responsive  service  delivery;  provide  a  peace  dividend;  empower  communities, \nparticularly  DAGs,  to  reassert  their  rights;  and  harmonize  the  support  and  programs  of \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n4.  ADB Strategy, Operations, and Lessons \n \n31.  Strategy. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program (CSP) \n(2005\u20132009)25 for Nepal is premised on the assumption that the development process in the \ncountry needs to be more broad-based and inclusive. In this regard, the overarching goal of \npoverty reduction is tied to the intermediate goal of inclusive development. One of the primary \nstrategies of ADB in helping Nepal develop is the focus on improved governance, which has \nsignificant implications for the delivery of economic and social services. As a result, the CSP \nhighlights that all sector operations should include measures aimed at improving governance. In \nparticular, the CSP asserts that key priorities in governance include promoting decentralization \nand  greater  transparency  and  accountability  in  public  service  delivery,  as  well  as  building \ncapacity. ADB\u2019s latest country operations business plan for Nepal26 confirms this focus. \n \n32.  An inclusive development process contributes to social and economic progress and \npolitical stability, and mainstreaming inclusion and emphasizing transparency and accountability \nare key components of development. ADB\u2019s strategy of focusing on good governance is central \nto ensuring an inclusive development process. In this regard, ADB\u2019s operations in Nepal have \nplaced emphasis on the following: (i) encouraging public policies that facilitate the participation \nof  women  and  DAGs  in  the  development  process  and  government;  (ii)  providing  targeted \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2004.

Operations. ADB operations in Nepal have covered the gamut of sectors, including \nagriculture and rural development, education, energy, transport and communications, water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  urban  development,  finance,  and  governance.  With  respect  to \ngovernance, the focus has been on civil service reforms, anticorruption, governance reforms for \nbetter service delivery, institutional capacity building, and decentralized governance. Relevant \ncrosscutting themes include gender and social inclusion, particularly empowering women and \nmainstreaming gender considerations in ADB operations. \n \n34.  As in other countries, ADB\u2019s operations in Nepal recognize the criticality of (i) a long-\nterm commitment to capacity development, (ii) encouraging good governance practices, and (iii) \nan appropriate policy and institutional environment. ADB has continually sought to emphasize \nownership and commitment to reforms by political leaders, the Government, and civil society as \nthe basis of development effectiveness. \n \n35.  Lessons. Lessons drawn from the operations of ADB and other development partners \nguide the formulation of the GSP Cluster. Some relevant lessons are that (i) clear targeting \ncriteria for DAGs should be transparent and specified upfront; (ii) the qualitative participation of \nwomen and other DAGs in governance is still a challenge; (iii) a project-oriented and ad hoc \napproach  to  local  development  is  not  likely  to  be  very  effective  in  attaining  development \noutcomes; and (iv) the approval of rules and regulations should be expedited, as their absence \ncompromises effective service delivery. \n36.  ADB\u2019s rather substantial familiarity with the country\u2019s governance challenges resulted in \nassistance with the Governance Reform Program.27 It showed that (i) a support program on \ngovernance should not be very broad but should at the same time provide for flexibility in \nprogram design and implementation arrangements; (ii) a long-term commitment to reforms is \nimportant; and (iii) in a conflict situation as existed in Nepal, continuous engagement with \nstakeholders at all levels is the only way to ensure the attainment of program outcomes. \nFollowing the closure of the Governance Reform Program, the Government requested targeted \nand focused support for improving local service delivery during the political transition and for \ngovernance reforms at the center following the completion of state restructuring. The program \ncluster approach in the GSP is ADB's response to the Government\u2019s request. \n37.  Lessons learned from relevant technical assistance28 include the following: \n(i)  Even small investments can make a big difference locally, particularly as they \nrelate to development efforts by women\u2019s groups.  \n(ii)  Consensus-based development effort is not only necessary but very possible at \nthe local level. \n                                                 \n27 ADB. 2001.

ADB. \n ", "    11 \n(iii)  Social mobilization is key, both the kind targeted to specific communities and on \nspecific themes and areas and the holistic, generic kind. \n(iv)  Social inclusiveness takes time to come to fruition, as it tackles long-held biases. \n(v)  Program effectiveness relies on minimizing transaction costs. \n(vi)  Managing  expectations  is  a  particular  risk  in  any  program  that  is  not \ncommunicated accurately and often with the final stakeholders. \n \n38.  The design of the GSP is also based on lessons from Operations Evaluation Department \nevaluations of program loans.29 These evaluations highlight the benefits of flexibility in policy \naction conditions, as well as incorporating considerations of political economy in program design \nthat targets policy reforms.  \n5.  External Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n \n39.  While development partners have always been active in Nepal in the areas of good \ngovernance, local development, and decentralization (see Appendix 3), what has been absent is \na coherent approach to aligning their support into a program that is truly national in scope and \ncharacter. The LGCDP, designed by the Government with the support of development partners, \nfills that void. Key areas of support in local governance include (i) local development, including \nsupport to communities and CBOs; (ii) decentralized governance advisory support; (iii) social \ninclusion for DAGs; (iv) decentralized financing; and (v) participatory local planning processes.  \n40.  Coordination among development partners for actions in these areas is done through \nseveral local consultative group committees, including those on governance. ADB is an active \nmember of these committees. Cooperation among development partners is evident in their \ndecision to (i) be involved in the conceptualization and development of the LGCDP, (ii) do joint \nassessments, and (iii) pool resources to fund the resulting reforms. \n6.  Rationale \n \n41.  Rationale for the GSP and Program Cluster Approach. The rationale for the GSP \ncenters on the need to support reforms in local governance and community development in \nNepal at a critical juncture in its history. In seeking to provide this support, ADB is keen to \nemploy a program cluster approach with the hope that, in the medium term, the Government \nand its development partners will be able to employ a program-based approach to reforms in \nline with the coordinated support for a Government-owned program. The rationale for a program \ncluster approach is based on the fundamental premise that only a holistic and long-term, vision-\noriented program of support will enable the Government to plan reforms better (see Appendix 6). \nThis is especially so at a time of significant and fundamental political changes in the country that \nhave  deep  implications  for  local  governance.  A  program  cluster  approach  will  enable  the \nGovernment to take a sustained approach to reforms. \n \n42.  Rationale for Subprogram I. While the rationale for the program cluster approach is \nrelated to the manner in which support is to be provided to Government, the underlying rationale \nfor the GSP, whose subprogram I supports the outcomes of the national program, is premised \non a number of considerations: \n(i)  Poverty reduction is at the core of development action in Nepal, and one of its \nkey elements is the effective delivery of basic public goods and services, with \nparticular attention to supporting communities in remote and marginalized areas. \n                                                 \n29 For example, Operations Evaluation Department. 2007. Summary of Lessons from Evaluations of ADB Programs \nin Support of Public Sector Reform. Manila: ADB.  \n ", "12    \n(ii)  In  the  post-conflict  environment  that  exists  in  Nepal,  the  need  to  ensure  a \ntangible peace dividend and a framework for recovery is a major justification for \nthe  GSP.  This  particular  recovery  effort  is  premised  on  the  broad  political \nconsensus on federalism.  \n(iii)  The current system of rather ad hoc distribution of grants to local bodies needs \nimprovement. The LGCDP will replace it with criteria-based grants, and top-up \ngrants will be provided for the equitable distribution of resources to local bodies \nas part of the peace dividend. \n(iv)  The  Government  has  stated  its  dissatisfaction  with  project-oriented  support \nmodalities toward reform, and the LGCDP provides the right opportunity to work \nin a more holistic manner. The LGCDP is also well balanced in terms of its focus \non demand for and supply of good local governance. \n(v)  There is a need to mobilize DAGs and empower communities to make optimal \nuse of the development space created by recent political changes. Widespread \nbuy-in from development partners enables a joint approach to reforms. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \n43.  ADB  support  for  the  Government\u2019s  reform  of  local  governance  and  community \ndevelopment  is  premised  on  the  country\u2019s  movement  toward  federalism,  which  creates \nsignificant need for the right structures and mechanisms both centrally and locally to make \nfederalism work. This requires a medium-term plan of support to the Government. The proposed \nGSP cluster addresses this need. \n \n44.  The overriding goal of the GSP is social and economic transformation to build a new \nNepal through (i) a capable and accountable government at all levels that provides effective and \ninclusive services, and (ii) empowered communities that engage actively with government to \nhold it accountable. The main outcomes include (i) a better local operating environment, (ii) fully \nfunctional local governments that are capable and accountable, (iii) stronger CBOs and DAGs, \n(iv) inclusive and participatory service delivery systems, (v) supportive central agencies and \nprocesses, and (vi) a strong national system and Government leadership. \n \n45.  To attain the goal and outcomes detailed above, the GSP takes a phased approach to \nsupporting  the  Government.  As  such,  it  consists  of  two  subprograms  (see  Appendix  6).30 \nSubprogram I (SP1) (2008\u20132012) will emphasize community mobilization and strengthening to \nhold local bodies accountable, strengthen their capability to provide effective and inclusive \nservices, and institute relevant central protocols and systems to support the local governance \nreform agenda. Subprogram II (SP2) (2012\u20132015) will concentrate on the reengineering of \nbusiness processes needed at the center to support a federal government structure, putting in \nplace the legal framework for proper local governance, strengthening the fiscal transfer process \nand system, and then strengthening community organizations and local bodies. \n \n46.  The  Government,  for  its  part,  has  prepared  the  LGCDP,  which  SP1  mirrors.  The \nGovernment has sought support from ADB and other development partners, and SP1 will \ndirectly support the LGCDP. In that regard, the term \u201cprogram\u201d in this document should be taken \nto mean both the GSP SP1 and the LGCDP, unless otherwise indicated.  \n \n                                                 \n30 Total support to the Government for these two subprograms is $156.3 million ($106.3 million for subprogram 1 and, \ntentatively, $50 million for subprogram 2). \n ", "    13 \nA.  Impact  \n47.  The overall impact of the proposed SP1 is to contribute, through the LGCDP, to poverty \nreduction  through  socially  inclusive,  gender-responsive,  strong,  and  accountable  local \ngovernance and participatory, community-led development, which will ensure the increased \ninvolvement of women and DAGs (including Dalits, Madhesis, Adibasis, and Janajatis) in local \ngovernance processes and outcomes. The program is in keeping with the Government\u2019s stated \noutcomes with respect to these areas in the TYIP. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n48.  The policy framework and actions of SP1 draw entirely from the LGCDP. They are \nbased on the premise that, by early- to mid-2009, multiple donors will have committed funds \nthrough a joint financing arrangement to support the LGCDP. These funds will be released in \naccordance with the annual implementation plans of the LGCDP, subject to having reached \ncertain performance indicators under the plan of the previous year. The policy conditions for the \nfirst tranche are steps that are required to finalize the details of the LGCDP. There is consensus \namong development partners in Nepal that the framework and actions need to be strongly \nsupported if the Government is to attain its vision for reform. \n \n  1.  Outcomes \n \n49.  The outcomes as detailed in the LGCDP are (i) citizens and communities empowered \nand actively engaged with local bodies and holding them accountable; (ii) the improved capacity \nof local bodies to manage resources and deliver basic services inclusively and equitably; and (iii) \nstrengthened  policy  and  national  institutional  frameworks,  including  legal  frameworks,  for \ndecentralization, devolution, and community development.31 \n \n  2.  Program Components and Outputs  \n \n50.  SP1 of the GSP will support achieving the goals of the LGCDP.32 A programmatic and \nlogical link exists among the three outcomes listed above and to the specifications of the \ncomponents  and  outputs  of  the  LGCDP.33 First,  on  the  side  of  demand  for  good  local \ngovernance, citizens and communities will be encouraged to speak up more than they currently \ndo and to engage actively in local body resource allocation and decision making. Second, on \nthe supply side, the focus will be on improving the capacity of local bodies to manage resources \nand deliver basic services inclusively and equitably. Finally, to provide the needed macro and \npolicy  support,  the  national  institutional  framework  for  decentralization,  devolution,  and \ncommunity development will be strengthened.34 \n \na.  Component  1:  Citizens  and  Communities  Actively  Engaged  with \nLocal Bodies and Hold Them Accountable \n \n51.  This component aims to promote the capacity of communities, especially the more \ndisadvantaged groups and those in more remote rural areas and urban pockets, to articulate \n                                                 \n31 The development policy letter and policy matrix of SP1 are in Appendix 5. \n32 The outputs and performance targets of the program are in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. All \nthe descriptions and specifications of the program are from the approved document on the LGCDP. \n33 See Supplementary Appendix A for a discussion of the program logic and results chain. \n34 There will also be a strong focus on institutional mechanisms for downward accountability; as there are no elected \nlocal representatives yet, alternative institutional mechanisms for downward accountability are needed. Activities \nwill aim to ensure the capacity of communities to hold decision makers accountable and act on their development \npriorities. Basic tools (e.g., public hearings, public and social audits, etc.) will be used for this purpose. \n ", "14    \ntheir needs and priorities and make their claims on local bodies\u2014i.e., to promote more effective \ndemand  and  voice.  Activities  under  this  component  are  explicitly  intended  to  ensure  that \ncommunities are able to access these resources and use them in ways that are consistent with \nlocal needs and priorities. Social mobilization activities will empower communities and CBOs to \nengage in the local, bottom-up planning process, as provided for in the LSGA, to ensure that \nthey access the public resources and services that they require on a priority basis.35 \n \ni.  Output  1.1:  Empowered  Communities  and  CBOs  that \nParticipate in Local Governance Processes \n \n52.  To help achieve this output, the program will focus on social mobilization in communities \naimed at encouraging communities and CBOs to (i) interact with local bodies, including in the \nplanning and budgeting process; (ii) have a voice in the process by which decisions are made \nabout plan implementation; and (iii) gain oversight of local body activities. Social mobilizers and \nmobilizing agencies36 will help communities and CBOs to engage with their local bodies and \nestablish linkages with other service-providing local agencies.37 \n \nii.  Output 1.2: More Capable Communities, Including DAGs, that \nAssert Their Rights and Hold Local Bodies Accountable \n \n53.  This output will ensure that the general public becomes more aware of local governance \nissues and processes. Communities will be provided with meaningful opportunities to hold their \nlocal bodies accountable for their performance in effectively and efficiently meeting local needs \nand priorities. This will be done through (i) information, education, and communication activities; \n(ii)  strengthened  mechanisms  for  local  and  community  advocacy  and  monitoring;  and  (iii) \ncapacity-building support to citizens\u2019 institutions that are led by DAGs so that they can promote \ninteraction with local bodies. \n \n54.  It is recognized that it will be necessary to go simultaneously into social mobilization and \ncore information, education, and communication activities to foster more meaningful interaction \nbetween citizens and civil society, on the one hand, and local bodies on the other. Through a \nLocal Governance and Accountability Facility (LGAF),38 local bodies will be able to build on \nmonitoring results to finance a range of more innovative activities. \n \nb.  Component  2:  Better  Management  of  Resources  and  Delivery  of \nServices Inclusively and Equitably by Capable Local Bodies \n \n55.  Component  2  recognizes  that  making  the  demand  side  of  local  governance  more \neffective through component 1 is needed, but that little will be achieved unless the supply side is \nalso strengthened to effectively meet the increased demands of citizens. Local bodies need to \nbuild their capacity to respond effectively to expressed priorities and needs. To ensure that this \nhappens, component 2 will focus on three outputs. \n \n                                                 \n35 See Appendix 7 for a detailed discussion of the role of social mobilization in program implementation.  \n36 Where needed, and staying within the resource envelope, gender focal points will be established locally to work \nwith the social mobilizers. \n37 Support will be provided to facilitate community-to-community linkages, and exposure trips for selected groups to, \nfor example, district headquarters or even regional training centers will be programmed. \n38 The LGAF, to be provided as part of development partner support to the national program, is a mechanism by \nwhich Government will enable independent monitoring of functions of the local bodies to ensure that they are \ncarried out accountably and in the manner specified in the national program. This will make it possible for citizens \n(particularly DAGs) to hold to account service providers. The Facility\u2019s scope of work will be limited to independent \nmonitoring functions, and will not constitute a parallel financing mechanism in the Program. \n ", "    15 \ni.  Output  2.1:  Access  to  Greater  Fiscal  Resources  for  Local \nBodies in Equitable and Appropriate Ways \n \n56.  There are two primary methods by which this output will be attained: (i) increased block \ngrant transfers to local bodies and, on a more selective basis, (ii) improvements in local bodies\u2019 \nown-source revenue collection. The former will act as a fiscal incentive for citizens to participate \nin local governance because more resources will be at stake. Application of the MCPM39 linked \nto development grants will promote better performance in core areas such as planning, financial \nmanagement, good governance, and transparency.40 \n \nii.  Output  2.2:  Appropriate  Measures  to  Build  Capacity  in  All \nLevels of the Local Body Service Delivery System \n \n57.  While access to more fiscal resources will undoubtedly strengthen the capacity of local \nbodies to respond to priorities and needs, developing systemic and human capacities will also \nbe required. This will be done in a variety of ways and will allow for the inclusion of capacity \nbuilding for implementation and production functions:41 \n(i)  a supply-driven component wherein all local bodies are provided with training in \nbasic areas of management and user-friendly manuals in general systems and \nprocedures designed to help them manage better; \n(ii)  a demand-driven component through which local bodies formulate their own \ncapacity-development  plans  and  finance  their  implementation  out  of  annual \ncapacity-development grants; and \n(iii)  a DDC-led system of support, regular backstopping, and mentoring for VDCs, \nwhich  will  enable  local  bodies  to  establish  important  linkages  among \ndevelopment  grants,  the  incentives  (rewards  and  sanctions,  assessment \nsystems),  and  their  ability  to  address  the  identified  functional  gaps  and \nweaknesses in an equitable manner.  \n \niii.  Output  2.3:  Fine-tuned  Local  Body  Service  Delivery \nMechanisms and Processes \n \n58.  To make existing service delivery processes more effective, the program will experiment \nwith new ways of doing things in four specific areas, with a view to having these pilots scaled up \nlater. They include the following: \n(i)  Piloting updates on procedures on public expenditure management and \npublic  finance  management.  This  will  be  expanded  to  include  monitoring, \nevaluation,  and  reporting  systems  by  local  bodies,  with  provisions  made  to \nincorporate gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) indicators. It will include \npiloting alternative  ways  for  VDCs  to access  technical support  to  implement \ninvestment subprojects, including conducting necessary assessments regarding \nrelevant safeguards that may be triggered as a result of investment decisions. \n(ii)  Testing safety nets and social assistance programs. Piloting will take place of \nthe administration of safety net and social assistance programs by VDCs to \nprovide the poorest people and communities with opportunities to build up assets. \nThe  type  of  social  assistance  programs  to  be  piloted  will  be  cash-transfer \nsystems, both targeted and not and conditional and not.42 \n                                                 \n39 See Appendix 4 for a discussion of the MCPM system. \n40 Efforts will also be made to ensure that gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) issues are incorporated in the \ncriteria for MCPM grants to local bodies, and that MCPM indicators better reflect GESI considerations. \n41 Many of these functions will be fulfilled by agencies (e.g., user groups, CBOs, and private contractors). \n42 Safety net programs will address the immediate needs of DAGs as prioritized by themselves.  \n ", "16    \n(iii)  Piloting innovative uses of conditional sector grants. These will be piloted for \neducation,  health,  and  agriculture  in  a  limited  number  of  DDCs.  Sector-\nconditional grants will be made to DDCs, which will then undertake joint planning \nand budgeting exercises with the relevant district sector offices. The grants will \nnot  be  limited  to  capital  expenditures  but  will  also  be  used  for  financing \noperational development expenditures (e.g., travel allowances, equipment, etc.) \non the basis of Government budget norms. \n(iv)  Testing DDC local coordination functions. While mandated by LSGA, DDC \ncoordination across the country displays considerable variation in effectiveness \nand quality. The LGCDP will therefore pilot innovative mechanisms by which \nDDCs can fulfill their coordination functions (e.g., involving NGOs and the private \nsector in service delivery). This will include establishing forums for coordination \nand sharing experiences. \n \nc.  Component  3:  Strengthened  Policy  and  National  Institutional \nFramework for Devolution and Local Self-Governance \n \n59.  While components 1 and 2 of the program will jointly make a significant contribution \ntoward better public services locally and ultimately poverty reduction, actions taken in regard to \npolicy and national institutions will further enhance program impact. This is needed because of \nuncertainty about the form and nature of the forthcoming national framework for federalism and \ncenter\u2013local relationships. In this vacuum, central agencies such as MLD will continue to play \ncritical roles in local development issues. Two particular outputs are targeted here. \n \ni.  Output 3.1: Policy Framework for Decentralization to Promote \na More Enabling Environment for Effective, Transparent, and \nAccountable Local Governance \n \n60.  Program-specific activities to help yield this output include the following: \n(i)  Review decentralization and sector devolution policy in close liaison with the \nState Restructuring Commission to be formed by the Constituent Assembly. \n(ii)  Establish a broad decentralization approach that will contribute to a more \nholistic and program-based approach to local governance. \n(iii)  Prepare a more effective policy environment for the demand side of local \ngovernance, including conducting a thorough review of the constraints to \ncommunity engagement with local bodies. \n(iv)  Prepare improved staffing policies for local bodies.43 \n(v)  Prepare a national capacity-development strategy for local bodies.44 \n(vi)  Support evidence-based policymaking by conducting outcome and impact \nstudies of local governance and community development initiatives. \n \nii.  Output  3.2:  Strong  Central  Government  and  National \nNongovernment Institutions that Provide Appropriate Support \nto Local Bodies \n \n61.  The LGCDP will strengthen the capacity of central institutions by \n                                                 \n43 The LGCDP seeks to create a more stable and effective staffing system for local bodies, which has added \nimportance with the ongoing absence of elected bodies. Close linkages will be maintained with other agencies in \nthe process, such as the involvement of the Ministry of General Administration, and articulation with other ongoing \nreform processes, such as the commitment for 33% representation for women at all levels of administration. \n44 This will take into account the MCPM system, the need to avoid any monopoly over the provision of training \nservices, and the role of various local body associations, such as the Municipality Association of Nepal. \n ", "    17 \n(i)  providing  support  to  the  Local  Bodies  Fiscal  Commission,  particularly  in \nelaborating  and  fine-tuning  the  grant-allocation  formula  and  expenditure  and \nrevenue assignment and revenue mobilization activities, and by reviewing and \npiloting PFM procedures, including accounting systems; \n(ii)  providing support to the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and local peace \ncommittees (LPCs) in their work supporting local development;45 \n(iii)  providing support to local body associations to enhance their role in key policy \ndiscussions with the Government in terms of advocacy for local bodies, including \nissues related to fiscal transfers and capacity building; \n(iv)  supporting the implementation of the National Capacity Development Strategy for \nlocal bodies through training institutions, regional workshops and training events, \nprivate consultants, and development partners;46 \n(v)  designing  and  implementing  the  local  body  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) system in MLD, particularly on improving the system of both \nfinancial and physical reporting; \n(vi)  strengthening GESI in MLD such that it can mainstream GESI issues in the \nsupport that it provides to local bodies; \n(vii)  organizing  capacity-building  programs  for  the  decentralization  focal  units  of \nvarious line ministries47 and local body associations to ensure that the principles \nof decentralization and sector devolution are internalized; and \n(viii)  providing capacity-building support to the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) \nwith foci on outreach to DDCs and VDCs,48 the elaboration of audit guidelines, \nand  training  in  new  tools  and  programs  including  the  MCPM  system, \nprocurement regulations, and accounting systems.  \n \nC.  Important Features \n62.  SP1, in its support of the LGCDP, (i) conforms to the vision, policies, outcomes, and new \ninitiatives of the Government; (ii) places strong emphasis on inclusiveness and gender equity, \ntwo outcomes that have been at the bedrock of the new political movement in Nepal; (iii) is \naligned with the peace-building process;49 and (v) is based on a harmonized approach with \nother development partners. \n \n63.  SP1 provides support to the LGCDP by focusing on the following tools: \n(i)  the social mobilization of communities and CBOs (see Appendix 7), \n(ii)  the expanded system of block grants to local bodies so that resource scarcity is \nnot a binding constraint on strong local development action, \n(iii)  a rigorous MCPM system that relies on performance criteria-based funding to \nlocal bodies,50 \n(iv)  piloting new ways of doing things in the area of service delivery, and \n                                                 \n45 The  LPCs  are  constituted  with  all-party  and  civil  society  representation  and  function  as  an  early  warning \nmechanism to minimize conflict; they also provide support to improve government\u2013citizen interaction. \n46 This activity will also include provisions by MLD to support the capacity of local bodies to conduct socio-\nenvironmental assessments through contracts with external parties and through the enhanced capacity of the \ndistrict technical office and other suitable local entities. \n47 Including the National Planning Commission Secretariat, Ministry of Finance, Office of the Prime Minister and \nCouncil of Ministers, Ministry of General Administration, and selected ministries such as health and education. \n48 OAG is not expected to carry out all the audits but be involved in quality assurance and oversight.  \n49 It will follow conflict-sensitive implementation approaches and promote factors for peace building, as well as \ncoordinate with LPCs to ensure that they support government\u2013citizen interactions. \n50 Funding will be allocated to allow a substantial increase in the Government\u2019s current annual grant support to local \nbodies nationwide and to introduce incentives for better local performance and compliance with agreed governance \nstandards through the use of the MCPM system. \n ", "18    \n(v)  capacity building both centrally and locally so that all institutions receive support \nto attain their desired outcomes.  \n \nD.

Financing \n \n65.  Financing to meet the costs of the LGCDP has been tentatively determined as shown in  \nTable 2. \n                                                 \n51 The estimates have been prepared by the Government and its development partners and were confirmed with the \nGovernment during ADB fact-finding and appraisal missions. \n ", "    19 \n \nTable 2: Financing \n($ million) \nSource  Total \nGovernment of Nepal  260.8 \nAsian Development Bank   106.3 \nTotal  367.1 \n  Funding Gap  102.6 \nSource: Government estimates. \n \n66.  After  Government  contribution  of  $260.8  million,52 and  $106.3  million  from  ADB,  a \nfunding gap of $102.6 million remains. The Government expects to address the funding gap \nthrough commitments of support from other development partners. At this stage, those that \nhave  indicated  their  intention  to  support  the  program  include  the  Canadian  International \nDevelopment Agency (CIDA) for $10 million, the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International \nDevelopment for $30 million, Denmark for $15 million, Norway for $10 million, the Swiss Agency \nfor Development and Cooperation for $4 million, and other United Nations agencies for $25 \nmillion (United Nations Development Programme for $5 million, United Nations Population Fund \nfor $9 million, United Nations Volunteers for $0.5 million, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund for \n$8.5 million, and United Nations Capital Development Fund for $2 million). CIDA has informed \nGovernment  that  it  will  channel  its  contribution  of  C$10  million  through  a  cofinancing \narrangement with ADB. Financing from other development partners will be provided in parallel \nand not through ADB administration. \n \n67.  It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s LGCDP by providing a grant of \n$106.3  million  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  Grant  Recipient  will  be  the  Federal \nDemocratic Republic of Nepal. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n \n68.  The program management structure for the LGCDP is already in place in MLD, which \nwill execute it (see Appendix 7). MLD will take overall responsibility for attaining the outcomes of \nthe LGCDP. To accomplish this, it has already established a national advisory committee (NAC) \nfor  coordination,  policy  advocacy,  and  supervision  of  the  program,  as  well  as  for  making \nstrategic recommendations concerning its implementation. NAC is chaired by the secretary of \nMLD and guided by the policy coordination committee (PCC) that already exists in MLD. NAC \nconsists of senior officials of MLD and other sectoral ministries, as well as representatives of \ndevelopment partners and local body associations. The MLD secretary has appointed the joint \nsecretary of the Local Governance Coordination Division as the part-time national program \ndirector (NPD), who acts as member-secretary of NAC. NAC will meet whenever necessary, but \nnot less than twice a year, to (i) provide support on policy matters related to local governance \nand  community  development,  (ii)  oversee  program  implementation  and  progress,  and  (iii) \nfacilitate cooperation and coordination among all relevant agencies and development partners. \n \n69.  A program coordination unit (PCU) has been established under the Local Governance \nCoordination Division of MLD, which will ensure the internal coordination of policy activities \n                                                 \n52 The Government, in late September 2008, announced a national budget in which the amount of grant for each \nvillage development committee was increased by 100%. The implications of this increase in grant amount on the \nprogram budget have not been reflected here as the Ministry of Local Development has yet to revise the LGCDP \ndocument accordingly. \n ", "20    \nrelated to the LGCDP. The LGCDP is being managed full-time by an undersecretary of MLD, \nacting as program manager and heading the PCU day to day. The program manager reports to \nthe NPD, who reports in turn to the MLD secretary and NAC. The PCU is responsible for work \nplanning, monitoring and evaluation, and providing technical support to the relevant agencies as \nnecessary. It coordinates the daily activities of the various implementing agencies (the local \nbodies)53 and provides secretariat services as needed for program implementation.  \n \n70.  Within the PCU are dedicated output managers for each of the seven outputs, selected \nfrom among the various section chiefs of MLD who are PCU members. This introduces a \ndegree of accountability internally in MLD in terms of results-based output management. PCU \noutput managers meet monthly to discuss issues regarding program implementation, and the \nPCU will prepare progress reports every trimester. The output managers will be supported by \nseveral professional advisors, who will bring specific technical skills related to local governance \nand community development.  \n \n71.  Program management arrangements related to the work of LPCs are in the Ministry of \nPeace and Reconstruction (MPR). The Local Peace Mechanism Coordination Section in MPR \nserves as the program implementation unit (PIU) for this component of the LGCDP. The PIU is \nheaded by an undersecretary and has two section officers to provide administrative support. \nThe PIU in MPR is supported by the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Division, and the MPR \nsecretary provides overall guidance to the LPC component of program work. \n \n72.  Locally, the LGCDP is coordinated in municipalities by their executive officers, with \nassistance from ward secretaries; in DDCs by local development officers, supported by a district \nprogram facilitator; and in VDCs by secretaries, supported by social mobilizers as needed. \nDDCs will also rely on the All-Party Mechanism and the integrated plan formulation committee \n(IPFC), which consists of members of political parties,54 CBOs, user groups, etc. The aim is to \nduplicate the IPFC process in VDCs and municipalities. \n \n73.  Joint Financing Arrangement (JFA) Provisions. As the Government and interested \ndevelopment partners in the LGCDP have expressed a strong preference for a JFA to govern \ntheir participation in the program, all the implementation arrangements specified above will be \ndetailed in the JFA when it is finalized. While specific program management arrangements \nunder the JFA cannot be ascertained in advance, these generally include the responsibilities of \neach party to the JFA, the funding mechanism, and fiduciary requirements. \n \n74.  Provision will be made for development partners party to the JFA to meet regularly to \nreview the financial and operational status and progress of the program and to commit and \ndisburse funds. Finally, under the JFA, each year MLD, as the Executing Agency (EA), will \nprepare an annual strategic implementation plan and an annual work plan and budget for the \nLGCDP. These will be reviewed by all participating development partners at the annual joint \nreview mission. Based on the outcome of the review, the JFA development partners will commit \nresources and agree on the share of funding for the coming fiscal year. \n \n2.  Period of Implementation \n \n75.  Reforms supported under SP1 will be completed 48 months after grant effectiveness. \n \n \n                                                 \n53 With the exception of the LPCs, whose work will be coordinated by the district administrations. \n54 Political parties represented in the All-Party Mechanism are only the seven that signed the Comprehensive Peace \nAccord; in the IPFC, other parties have a presence as well. \n ", "    21 \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n76.  The proceeds of the SP1 grant will be used to finance the costs, excluding local taxes \nand duties, of items produced in and procured from ADB member countries, other than those \nspecified  in  the  ineligible  list  in  Appendix  8  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources.  \n \n77.  In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,55 the  proceeds  of  the  SP1  grant  will  be \ndisbursed to the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal as the Grant Recipient. No supporting \nimport documentation will be required, but grant proceeds will be disbursed on the basis of \ncertification provided by the Grant Recipient for a period of 12 months for eligible expenditures, \nstarting  180  days  prior  to  grant  effectiveness.  When  grant  proceeds  are  expected  to  be \ndisbursed, the value of total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible \nimports, and (iii) imports financed under other official development assistance will be equal to or \ngreater than the amount expected to be disbursed during the year. The Government will certify \nthat its withdrawal request complies with this formula. Otherwise, import documentation under \nexisting procedures will be required.  \n \n4.  Counterpart Funds \n \n78.  The Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated from the proceeds \nof  the  SP1  grant  are  made  available  to  meet  the  indicative  costs  associated  with  the \nimplementation  of  the  LGCDP.56 Counterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  support  (i)  community \norganizations, particularly of women and DAGs; (ii) the operations of DDCs and VDCs, including \nas block and top-up grants;57 (iii) capacity building for local bodies through grants; (iv) the \noperations of LPCs; and (v) relevant central Government agencies that provide policy support \nfor decentralization. \n \n5.  Monitoring and Tranching \n \n79.  Monitoring mechanisms for the LGCDP as described in the national program document \nwill also apply for SP1; as these mechanisms are already detailed in the LGCDP document, \nthey are also expected to be incorporated in the JFA when it is finalized. \n \n80.  As soon as possible after grant effectiveness, MLD will develop a performance M&E \nsystem based on the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1), which will integrate local \nGESI indicators.58 Arrangements will be made for on-the-ground monitoring and mentoring to be \ndone by roving support-and-monitoring teams from the center consisting of key MLD, PCU, and \nline agency staff. These teams will operate under the supervision of MLD and the central \nprogram team. These teams will, in principle, comprise national specialists in local governance, \nsocial mobilization, local capacity building and planning, financial management, and monitoring. \nThe roving teams will have a dual role: on the one hand, provide support to local bodies to \nmonitor their own performance and, on the other, interact with and, in some cases, contract and \nbackstop local bodies, various NGOs, and other social mobilization agencies active in the area. \nFinally, the LGAF will be involved in the independent monitoring of the program. \n \n                                                 \n55 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila \n(R50-98, 23 March). \n56 Program adjustment indicative costs and assumptions are highlighted in Supplementary Appendix E. \n57 And of municipalities from year 2 of the program. \n58 Details of the M&E system will be worked out after grant effectiveness. \n ", "22    \n81.  Monitoring the work of the LPCs, pursuant to the increase in resource allocation to them \nas part of this program, will be done by MPR. ADB will participate in this monitoring as part of its \ninvolvement in the monitoring of the LGCDP as a whole. \n \n82.  Financing from SP1 for the LGCDP will be in three tranches (see Appendix 5): the first \ntranche,  not  exceeding  $20  million,  to  be  disbursed  upon  grant  effectiveness;  the  second \ntranche, not exceeding $45 million, to be disbursed upon finalization of the JFA between the \nGovernment and development partners, and subject to the Government fulfilling all second \ntranche  release  requirements;  and  the  third  tranche,  not  exceeding  $41.3  million,  to  be \ndisbursed  within  12  months  after  the  second  tranche,  subject  to  the  fulfillment  of  all \ncorresponding tranche release requirements.  \n \n83.  For tranche 1 release, immediately after grant effectiveness, the Government will open a \ndeposit account and a special account at Nepal Rastra Bank. The special account will be used \nspecifically for depositing and utilizing counterpart funds, i.e., the rupees generated from the \nproceeds of the grant. Once the JFA has been finalized, a pooled foreign exchange account at \nthe Nepal Rastra Bank will be used as the deposit account for the program. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n84.  To ensure proper fund management, ADB retains the right to audit the use of grant \nproceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the Government\u2019s  certification  for  each  withdrawal \napplication. In this regard, ADB may also request a performance-related audit of the LGCDP to \nbe carried out by OAG in close consultation with other development partners supporting the \nLGCDP. As for reporting, the PCU will send monthly progress and status reports to ADB59 on \npolicy  and  institutional  reforms.  The  progress  reports  will  be  results  based  and  describe \nprogress  on  the  implementation  schedule  and  identify  any  problems  encountered  and  the \nremedial actions taken. \n \n85.  Reporting formats for the LGCDP will be developed and provided to all local bodies. A \nrobust system for physical progress reporting, linked to an office in MLD, will be established to \nconsolidate, review, and follow up on reports. The progress, efficiency, and effectiveness of the \nLGCDP will be monitored through a regular reporting system that includes monthly, trimesterly, \nand annual reports. Finally, annual monitoring and performance reports will be published by \nMLD and include both physical and financial progress, including major achievements. Once \nother development partners come on board, the JFA will reflect all necessary accounting, \nauditing, and reporting requirements for the Program. \n \n86.  A separate stream of reports will be provided by MPR with respect to the work of the \nLPCs. These reports will be collated by MPR twice a year and forwarded to the peace and \nconflict management committee and NAC, with a copy going to ADB.  \n \n7.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n  \n87.  Program performance monitoring during the initial stages of the LGCDP (i.e., prior to the \nJFA being finalized) will be done by the Government and ADB. A program performance system \nwill be developed, at the latest by the time of the signing of the JFA, that will detail the relevant \nindicators and targets based on the design and monitoring framework and will serve as the \n                                                 \n59 In light of CIDA entering into a cofinancing arrangement with ADB, once that arrangement has been formalized \nthrough  a  memorandum  of  understanding,  currently  expected  before  end-2008,  all  program  management \narrangements that apply to ADB will also apply to CIDA. In that respect, CIDA will team up with ADB for all reviews, \nmonitoring, and other program-related actions. \n ", "    23 \nbasis  on  which  to  monitor  performance.  The  system  will  have  these  features:  (i)  realistic \nbaseline data and performance targets; (ii) a provision to incorporate the results of regular \nprogram monitoring; (iii) the use of such a system to better inform periodic review, particularly \nfor confirming the fulfillment of tranche policy requirements; and (iv) a provision to incorporate \nrelevant information from any associated evaluations that may be undertaken. The PCU will be \ninstrumental in preparing the program performance system and revising it as necessary. The \nJFA is expected to reflect these monitoring arrangements, as they are already incorporated in \nthe LGCDP document. \n \n88.  A  key  component  of  the  program  performance  monitoring  system  will  be  relevant \nbaseline data. At the moment, MLD has managed through the DAG mapping exercise to collect \na fair amount of relevant information, and some development partners, such as the United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), are helping to augment this. However, that information has \nyet to be converted to a format that would be the basis of the program performance monitoring \nsystem. Much of it is still in rudimentary form, and MLD is refining its content and structure. \nIndeed, one of the primary tasks during the program\u2019s inception phase should be making the \nnecessary arrangements for collecting and incorporating baseline data in reporting structures.  \n \n89.  The PIU in MPR will maintain a database of existing and planned LPCs, including details \nof their work. Within a month of grant effectiveness, the PIU will have developed performance \nindicators for LPCs and put in place a workable monitoring regime that can easily be adhered to. \n \n8.  Program Review \n \n90.  Joint annual reviews (JARs)60 for the program will be organized in accordance with a \nschedule to be determined in the JFA. \n \n91.  Midway through the LGCDP, there will be an evaluation of progress in (i) meeting \nprogram outcomes, (ii) legislative or financial actions, (iii) the use of program funds, and (iv) \ncapacity development measures, particularly at MLD and the DDCs. The review will consider \nany shifts in the policy environment for local governance pursuant to the debates in formulating \nthe new Constitution, at the core of which is expected to be the move toward federation. This \nreview is necessary to ensure that the LGCDP stays relevant even as macro and contextual \nchanges occur in the program environment. There will be a final review at the end of the \nprogram period, to be done by an independent party, with representation from among DAGs. \n \n9.  Anticorruption \n \n92.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the Second Governance \nand Corruption Action Plan were explained to and discussed with the Government and the EA \n(see section B.1 below). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, \nand transparency, and in keeping with provisions that the JFA may specify, but not restricted by \nit, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any allegedly corrupt, \n                                                 \n60 The first JAR will be the mechanism for proposing changes to the program document and implementation \nmodalities, etc. ADB, as part of the JFA, will monitor program implementation through periodic progress reports \nsubmitted by MLD to all development partners and will be part of the joint development partner missions to (i) \nconfirm the fulfillment of policy requirements for release of tranche 2 and 3 funds; (ii) confirm the release of \nadequate  funds  from  the  Government  for  LGCDP  activities;  (iii)  monitor  the  continued  applicability  of  the \nassumptions that may impact program success, such as on political conditions; and (iv) advise on actions to \nmaintain effective implementation in the program period. As the JFA is expected to be prepared within the next 6 \nmonths, no specific pre-JFA program review mechanism is specified. Should this not occur, ADB and MLD will \njointly review the program on the sixth month after grant effectiveness. \n ", "24    \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the LGCDP. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant agreement.61  \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Benefits \n1.  Sectoral Benefits and Impacts \n \n93.  The benefits and impact of SP1 will be evident at various levels. Locally, it will help \nimprove the effectiveness of service delivery through strong local bodies that will be more aware \nof how they need to engage with service recipients, particularly DAGs. Through the LGCDP, \nSP1  will  specifically  target  community  empowerment  through  holistic  and  targeted  social \nmobilization such that communities will be able to demand better services, access greater \nresources, and effectively hold accountable local bodies through, e.g., relying increasingly on \nsocial and public audits and public hearings. These benefits are important. In an environment \nwhere public awareness of rights in the political arena is at an all-time high, the program seeks \nto ensure that these rights are translated into opportunities to demand and attain economic \nrights.  In  the  medium  term,  this  is  expected  to  make  local  good  governance  increasingly \npossible and emphasize inclusive development. \n \n94.  At  a  higher  level,  the  benefits  of  SP1  are  expected  to  be  (i)  strengthened  policy \ncoordination among local bodies, central line agencies that have field-based operations, and \ncentral  planning  and  operational  bodies;  (ii)  a  workable  interim  arrangement  on  local \ngovernance and community development until a federal structure of government is in place; and \n(iii) a contribution toward building urgently needed public trust in government. \n \n2.  Social Benefits and Poverty Impact \n \n95.  SP1 seeks to minimize the impact of vulnerabilities to poor local service delivery. The \nGESI focus of the program particularly will target better access for women in DAGs (see \nAppendix 11). In line with other relevant work of ADB on the gender theme, the GESI plan will \nbe implemented as part of ADB support to the Government. Dedicated support to the work of \nthe LPCs in all districts where they operate now and in the future will mean that provisions will \nbe  made  to  ensure  that  women  and  representatives  from  DAGs  have  an  opportunity  to \nparticipate in local affairs.62 The LPCs are central to applying a conflict-sensitive approach to \nlocal development, which the Government and development partners accept as the primary \nmeans of bringing about inclusive development and public trust in local government.  \n \n96.  The impacts of SP1 are expected to be evident in the long term on poverty reduction. \nSocially inclusive and gender-responsive service delivery is apt to help the poorest segments of \nsociety gain better access to resources and opportunities. This, coupled with improvement in \nthe environment to provide feedback to local bodies, will mean that the socioeconomic benefits \nof the program will accrue to the poor as well. Greater scrutiny by communities will ensure that \nthere  are  fewer  leakages  in  the  system,  thus  providing  more  resources  for  development \nactivities. Finally, there are political benefits as well, as SP1 will enhance transparency and \naccountability in local bodies and, hopefully, bring greater public trust in Government in the \nmedium-to-long term. A summary social and poverty analysis is in Appendix 10. \n \n                                                 \n61 ADB will also ensure that all provisions in the JFA align with its Anticorruption Policy. \n62 The extent to which they will really be able to do so depends to a large extent on the effectiveness of local social \nmobilization efforts. \n ", "    25 \n3.  Institutional Benefits \n \n97.  The institutional benefits expected from SP1 are as follows: (i) As local bodies acquire \ngreater resources and effective control over how to employ them, the transaction costs of \nservice delivery are expected to drop. (ii) Local bodies will have opportunities to improve their \ncapacity to fulfill their mandates more effectively.63 (iii) The institutional capacity of the local \nbodies and midlevel agencies, such as the Association of District Development Committees in \nNepal, Municipality Association of Nepal, and National Association of Village Development \nCommittees  in  Nepal,  will  correspondingly  improve.  (iv)  Capacity  for  policy  making  and \nmonitoring at MLD and other central agencies will improve, as technical assistance will be \nprovided for these functions. (v) Ancillary and associated entities such as the LPCs will benefit \nfrom the scope given to them to participate more effectively in interacting with local bodies and \ncommunities. \n \nB.  Risk Assessment and Safeguards \n1.  Risk Assessment \n \n98.  While  there  is  significant  commitment  to  and  enthusiasm  for  the  LGCDP  in  the \nGovernment, there are some primary risks as well. 64 \n \n99.  Public  Financial  Management  and  Fiduciary  Risks.  The  Government\u2019s  self-\nassessment of public financial management in 2007 revealed a well designed but unevenly \nimplemented system.65 In particular, significant implementation constraints were identified in the \nbudget. Local public financial management is considered to be particularly weak due to poor \ngovernment  commitment,  small  revenue  bases,  constrained  grants,  unclear  roles  and \nresponsibilities, and constrained fund-flow mechanisms. Further, two relevant risks highlighted \nin the country financial accountability assessment carried out in May 2005 by the World Bank \nand  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  are  (i)  a  lack  of \ntransparency  in  the  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfer  system;  and  (ii)  weak  reporting  and \noversight on the part of various agencies, including local bodies.66 The assessment found the \ncountry\u2019s fiduciary risks high. \n \n100.  Specific mitigating measures that are proposed to manage fiduciary risks include:67 \n(i)  Funds flow directly from MOF to local bodies (see Supplementary Appendix D). \n(ii)  Monthly reports will be sought from the Government to track budget expenditures \non relevant program items. \n                                                 \n63 One particular benefit that local bodies will gain from the program is capability enhancement for conducting socio-\nenvironmental assessments and maintaining adherence to the safeguards framework in alignment  with the \nEnvironmental Protection Act and its associated regulations.  \n64 The summary governance risk assessment in Appendix 9 was updated during the Appraisal Mission in conjunction \nwith the Government and development partners. The Government has approved the aide memoire of the Appraisal \nMission. See Supplementary Appendix F for a detailed risk assessment. \n65 Government of Nepal. 2007. Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability: Public Financial Management \nPerformance Measurement Framework 2007. Kathmandu.  \n66 Other identified fiduciary risks include (i) ineffective fund-flow processes, (ii) weak financial management capacity \nin local bodies and MLD, (iii) poor capacity to audit and lack of follow-up on audits, (iv) weak procurement capacity \nand experience in MLD and local bodies, and (v) weak financial management performance in local bodies. \n67 A method of getting a better handle on fiduciary risks is to finalize the JFA, which requires that a fiduciary risk \nassessment be completed at that time. The Government has concurred with this measure. Through the JFA, \nappropriate fiscal controls in the program, including continuous monitoring by JFA partners, are expected to \nmitigate some of the fiduciary risks. For a more detailed analysis of the fiduciary risks in the program and mitigating \nmeasures, see Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix D. \n ", "26    \n(iii)  Initial fiduciary due diligence will be done with selected development partners to \nensure that the relevant risk mitigation measures have been incorporated in the \nLGCDP. \n(iv)  Assurances  have  been  sought  from  and  given  by  the  Government  that \ncounterpart funds will be made available and that they will be spent for program-\nspecific  outputs.  Regular  monitoring  of  this  commitment  will  be  done  during \nprogram implementation.  \n(v)  The  release  of  funds  will  be  subject  to  demonstrated  progress  in  meeting \nprogram outcomes. \n(vi)  Local bodies will receive incentives to improve financial management from the \nMCPM system and other measures, such as disclosure of results and public and \nsocial audits, report cards, etc. \n(vii)  Support will be provided to OAG toward developing local audit guidelines and \ntraining, including assisting in the quality assurance of VDC audits. \n \n101.  Low Institutional Capacity. SP1 may place some demands on the institutional capacity \nof Government agencies that execute and implement it. At the moment, a particular risk in this \nregard arises from non-adherence to Civil Service Act policies and rules on staff transfers, \nwhich has meant difficulties in retaining staff in conflict areas. Close performance monitoring \nand targeted technical assistance to MLD and local bodies will help mitigate some of the \nadverse effects of implementation delays due to capacity constraints. Stronger compliance with \nthe  Civil  Service  Act  will  be  an  effective  mitigating  measure  in  this  regard.  Strengthening \ninstitutional capacity is at the core of the technical assistance currently being provided to MLD \nby various development partners. The provision of specific capacity-development grants to local \nbodies is meant to partly address this risk. \n \n102.  Misgovernment and Corruption. These risks in the LGCDP stem from the following: (i) \nweaknesses  in  legislative  instruments,  such  as  the  Local  Self-Governance  Act;  (ii)  weak \ninstitutions;  (iii)  opaque  government  business  processes,  such  as  procurement  and \nintergovernmental fiscal transfers; (iv) the lack of measures to make local bodies accountable \nand  transparent;  and  (v)  weak  program  execution  and  implementation  arrangements.  The \nseverity of the risks vary, but type I risks, requiring urgent attention, are being managed partly \nby ongoing assistance from development partners, including ADB, in specific agencies and \nsectors  such  as  the  Commission  for  Investigation  of  Abuse  of  Authority,  OAG,  Financial \nComptroller  General\u2019s  Office,  MLD,  etc.68 Another  mitigating  measure  is  seeking  closer \ncompliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Local  Bodies  Financial  Administration  Regulations, \nGovernance (Management and Operation) Act, Procurement Act, Right to Information Act, etc. \n \n103.  Uncertainty in Continued Political Commitment. This could be a risk in the program, \nbut it must be said that the Government\u2019s political commitment to reforms in local governance \nand community development is currently very strong. It is expected to remain so in the near \nfuture, as it is directly related to the debate on federalism, which all political parties publicly and \nconsistently support.69 This has been evident in the share of resources set aside for local \n                                                 \n68 Government commitment has remained high for this program even at a time of political uncertainty. This, coupled \nwith the fact that the present Government has put a bit more emphasis on broadly addressing misgovernment and \ncorruption, is likely to facilitate efforts to contain these risks. For further risk analysis, see Appendix 9 and \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n69 Although the nature and scope of federalism are not yet clear, the commitment to state restructuring is manifest, \nand the LGCDP has been designed in a flexible manner to account for any shifts that may occur in the operating \nenvironment as a result of discussions on the nature of the future federal state. \n ", "    27 \ngovernment in recent years,70 including the doubling of local body grants and accepting that top-\nup grants will be made available to local bodies that perform well.  \n \n104.  SP1 assumes that (i) the Government\u2019s commitment to reforms will remain high, (ii) the \npolitical system will be more or less stable during implementation, and (iii) development partners \nwill continue, singly and jointly, to be engaged in the medium term. All these assumptions \nremain valid to date and are expected to be so at least until a new constitution is in place \nsometime in 2010 or 2011. \n \n2.  Safeguard Measures \n \n105.  SP1 will have positive direct impact on socially disadvantaged groups, including women, \nindigenous people, and ethnic minorities (Appendix 10). The implications for the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples were reviewed; while no significant adverse \nimpacts are anticipated, an environmental assessment and review framework and a social \nsafeguard framework were prepared and endorsed by the Government in case local bodies \ndecide to invest in physical infrastructure that would have impact. Appendix 12 presents the \nsocial and environmental safeguards framework (see also Supplementary Appendix G).71 \n \n106.  As local bodies, particularly VDCs,  do not generally have any capacity to conduct the \nneeded safeguard assessments on their own, the Government has agreed to earmark specific \nresources to (i) provide technical assistance to have the assessments provided by a third party \nto deal with short-term capability gaps and (ii) develop and finance a capacity-building plan \nwhereby officials of the district technical office and other relevant individuals will receive training \non relevant skills to deal with long-term gaps. The necessary program assurance and budgeting \nprovisions have been made in the program. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n107.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the grant agreement: \n(i)  The Government will ensure that counterpart funds in local currency generated \nfrom  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  grant  will  be  used  to  meet  the  financial \nrequirements associated with the implementation of the LGCDP; for that purpose, \nthe  Government  will  establish  a  special  account  at  Nepal  Rastra  Bank \nimmediately  after  grant  effectiveness.  Throughout  program  implementation, \nadequate allocation of counterpart funds will be made, approved, and released in \na timely manner to ensure the proper implementation of the LGCDP.  \n(ii)  Of the total ADB contribution, the Government will earmark in equal amounts \nfrom each tranche and for the program period (a) $4.5 million to support the work \nof LPCs, and (b) $1.8 million to support the capacity of local bodies and MLD to \nconduct environmental and social assessments and manage related safeguard \nreview, monitoring, and reporting activities. \n(iii)  Within  1  month  of  grant  effectiveness,  MLD  will  have  established  a  budget \ntracking system to track the use of counterpart funds generated by the grant on a \nfour-monthly basis until such a time that a JFA is in place in support of the \nLGCDP, at which time the provisions of the JFA will apply. \n                                                 \n70 The share of expenditures for local government in the TYIP is the highest among all expenditure categories \n(17.53%). \n71 Detailed safeguard framework documents will be incorporated in the Program Administration Manual. \n ", "28    \n(iv)  MLD will ensure that all local bodies, as and when they are included under the \nLGCDP, will be adequately staffed and provided with the necessary financial, \ntechnical, and other resources (including equipment) to perform their functions \nunder the program. \n(v)  MLD will ensure the timely and effective implementation the GESI action plan \nagreed between ADB and MLD, as well as the GESI strategy and guidelines to \nbe approved for the LGCDP. \n(vi)  MLD  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  LGCDP  in  accordance  with  the \nprovisions of the social and environmental safeguards framework for the LGCDP \nto  ensure  compliance  with  ADB's  environmental  assessment  and  applicable \ngovernment  environmental  requirements,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  requirements  on \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples development plans. \n(vii)  MLD will ensure the provision of allocated financial resources for the LGAF \nthroughout the program implementation period. \n(viii)  The baseline dataset for the program will be continually updated to ensure the \nproper application of results-based management. \n(ix)  MLD will ensure to review the program budget assumptions at the end of the \ninception phase of the LGCDP; MLD will make necessary reallocations across \nbudget  line  items  in  keeping  with  the  agreed  strategies,  action  plans,  and \nprogram approaches that will have been developed by then. \n \nB.  First Tranche Conditions \n108.  All first tranche policy actions and other requirements have been met by the Government. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n109.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed program  cluster  and  grant  would comply  with  the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove \n(i)

Sector Overview  \n1.  There have been significant achievements in the political process in Nepal in the past \nyear, key among them being the abolition of the monarchy when the Constituent Assembly in \nMay 2008 declared the country to be a federal democratic republic. This means that the country \nwill soon frame arrangements for transforming the hitherto unitary state into a federal system of \ngovernment. A primary consideration of the federal nature of governance will then focus on the \nnature of local government in the country. Until a federal structure is in place, local governance \nin Nepal is characterized by the following. \n \n1.  Structure \n2.  The administrative divisions set up under the royal regime continue to be in place. In this \nset-up, there are 14 zones, which have ceased to be meaningful; 75 districts that are varied in \nterms of geographical characteristics and, more importantly, in terms of economic endowment; \n3,915 village development committees; and 58 municipalities. Development committees exist in \nall  districts  and  are  mandated  to  lead  development  work  in  the  local  governance  unit. \nAdministrative oversight of the development committees is provided by the Ministry of Local \nDevelopment (MLD) whose mandate is to involve a majority of the people in the decision-\nmaking process of the governance system and empower them for overall development through \nlocal self-governance. \n \n3.  The system of local governance consists of village development committees (VDCs) and \nmunicipalities at the lower level and district development committees (DDCs) at the upper. All \nVDCs are divided into nine wards, and there are several community settlements in each. \nMunicipalities are divided into a minimum of nine wards and a maximum of 32. Wards are the \nsmallest units of local governance. Each district is divided into nine to seventeen Ilakas (or \nareas), which cover clusters of VDCs and municipalities. Each district has a district council and \nan executive committee. The district council is made up of DDC chairpersons, vice-chairpersons \nand  members,  the  district\u2019s  member(s)  of  Parliament,  mayors  and  deputy  mayors  of \nmunicipalities, VDC chairpersons and vice-chairpersons, and six nominated members. The \ndistrict council meets annually to discuss and approve DDC policies, programs, and budget. The \ndistrict executive committee runs daily-to-day DDC affairs, and MLD appoints secretaries in \nVDCs, executive officers in municipalities, and local development officers in DDCs. It also \ndeputes additional professional staff such as accountants, engineers, and planners to DDCs. \nLocal bodies generally appoint lower-level staff, though some DDCs have started to appoint \nprofessional staff by themselves. \n \n2.  Legal and Policy Environment \n4.  The  current  bases  for  decentralization  in  Nepal  are  the  stipulations  in  the  Interim \nConstitution of 20071 and the Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA), 1999. The Act gives VDCs, \nmunicipalities, and DDCs greater political, administrative, and financial powers to lead, facilitate, \n                                                 \n1  The Interim Constitution makes several provisions on devolution, including that (i) interim bodies are to be created \nlocally as per consensus among political parties, (ii) a balanced approach is to be taken in resource mobilization \nand allocation and in the equitable distribution of development results, and (iii) the roles and responsibilities of local \nbodies are to be delineated to make them more accountable in the planning and implementation of local services \n(special attention to be given to uplift socially and economically backward communities in revenue mobilization and \nallocation). \n ", "36   Appendix 2 \n \n \nand manage local affairs. Other relevant legislative, institutional, and policy instruments on local \ngovernance include the (i) Local Bodies Fiscal Commission (2002), (ii) Local Body Finance and \nAdministration  Regulations  (2007),  and  (iii)  Governance  (Management  and  Operation)  Act, \n2008.2 Finally, the Government\u2019s emphasis on decentralization, as it relates to planning, is best \ncontained in the Three Year Interim Plan (FY2008\u20132010), which, while necessarily interim in \nnature in line with the interim political arrangements currently in place, is very specific about the \nvision, objectives, and methodologies for strengthening local governance.  \n \n5.  In 2007, the Government prepared a White Paper on Local Development and Self-\nGovernance,  which  encourages  (i)  functional  devolution  to  local  bodies  for  greater  self-\ngovernance;  (ii)  awareness  raising  to  transform  the  state  machinery  to  become  more \nparticipatory, responsive, accountable, inclusive, and transparent; (iii) a purification process \nfrom the leadership to eradicate corruption, unfair norms, favoritism, partisanship, delays, and \nmisappropriation; and (iv) targeted programs for poor areas and communities to make service \ndelivery more equitable and accessible. \n \n6.  A particular aspect of this policy environment is that the country is now genuinely moving \naway from the simple notion of decentralization to the more broad-based and politically more \npowerful and meaningful one of devolution. The policy environment is vastly facilitated at this \nstage by the harmonized approach among Government and development partners on how to \nproceed with local governance and community development. \n \nB.  Situational Analysis  \n1.  Social and Poverty Indicators \n7.  The measures mentioned above are of recent origin, and their impact has yet to be \nnoticeably felt. In the meantime, gross spatial inequity establishes the need to fundamentally \nalter the paradigm of local governance.3 While poverty has declined across all regions, poverty \nlevels are still high in the remote Midwestern region (where the poverty rate is 45%) and \nFarwestern region (41%), compared with 27% in the Western and Central regions and 29% in \nthe Eastern region. The 11% point drop in poverty is distributed unevenly across different caste, \nethnic, and minority groups. In the last decade, poverty declined most significantly in upper \ncaste groups (by 46% in the upper caste Brahmin and Chhetri group) but only by 21% among \nthe lower caste Dalits, 10% among the hill Janajatis, and 6% among the Muslims.  \n \n8.  Gender disparities in terms of access to social, economic, and political opportunities \npersist.  Women  have  a  lower  literacy  rate  (38.2%)  compared  with  men  (69.3%),  less \nrepresentation in bureaucracy (only 12.7% of civil servants), and less access to productive \nresources. Gender disparities are more pronounced in rural areas than in urban. Women from \nsocially excluded groups and regions are even poorer and have lower educational and health \nstatus. There is a strong gender dimension to political exclusion, with women\u2019s representation in \nthe current Constituent Assembly at only 18%.  \n \n                                                 \n2  The Act spells out administrative functions and the responsibility of officials at different levels, including work \nprocedures to be adopted in government administration. It mandates, inter alia, keeping a citizen charter, providing \nmobile services, determining service fees on the basis of social justice, setting up a governance reform unit in \ngovernment agencies, conducting public hearings, managing grievances, setting up monitoring and evaluation \ncommittees, and the submission of annual reports by Government agencies.  \n3  Table A2.1 shows that, while Nepal as a whole performs poorly in various social indicators, spatial concentrations \nof poverty and depravation are even more profound. \n ", "Appendix 2    37\n \nTable A2.1: Social and Poverty Indicators \n  Period \nIndicators  Comparator Period  Latest Year \nA.

The failures in Table A2.2 notwithstanding, there have been some achievements. In \nparticular, several sectoral functions, such as in agricultural extension, have been devolved; \nrevenue sharing arrangements are in place in the tourism sector, hydropower, etc.; and a \nsystem of minimum conditions and performance measures has been instituted for transferring \nadditional funds to local bodies. \n \nC.  Future Steps \n11.  It is clear that, until federalism is firmly in place, efforts to strengthen local governance in \nNepal will have to be centered on the following: \n(i)  Inclusiveness and empowerment for downward accountability. These are at \nthe  core  of  the  outcomes  of  the  Interim  Constitution.  Disadvantaged  groups \n(DAGs) have for too long been left out of the governance process, and for them \nto better participate in local governance and receive services more effectively \nand equitably it is critical for government to specifically target and empower \nthem. \n(ii)  Capacity of local bodies for service delivery. To better enable local bodies to \nprovide services effectively, equitably, and inclusively, their capacity needs to be \nsubstantially  upgraded.  This  refers  not  only  to  capacity  related  to  physical \ninfrastructure4 but also to financial resources and technical expertise, as well as \nchanges in attitude toward public service. \n(iii)  Legislative  arrangements  for  local  governance. This is evident in (a) the \nLSGA, 1999, needing a substantive revamp as it conflicts with various other acts; \nand (b) the absence of a Local (Government) Service Act means the center \ncontinues to dictate human resource management policies and practices in local \nbodies, which is neither desirable nor practical. \n(iv)  Strengthened  associated  institutions.  While  the  absence  of  local  elected \nofficials has led to intransparent, often ad hoc, and politically motivated decision \nmaking, it is not likely that local elections will take place any time soon. In the \nmeantime, the Government will need to ensure that interim local bodies are fully \nfunctional and that other associated institutions are strengthened. \n(v)  Holistic approach. For too long, work on local governance has been ad hoc. \nDonor  harmonization  has  generally  been  missing,  and  this  has  forced  the \nGovernment to prepare guiding principles for a harmonized approach to donor \nactivity in this sector; the LGCDP is a result of this effort. \n(vi)  Reconsider the size and number of local bodies. As part of the work on \nrestructuring the country along federal lines, it will be essential to thoroughly \nreview the size and number of local bodies.5 The vast variance in resource \nendowment and other economic conditions among the presently constituted local \nbodies requires consideration of a more streamlined local governance system. \n \n12.  The Government has made some positive moves in the Three-Year Interim Plan, which \nneed to be sustained.6 Its proposed LGCDP is in response to this necessity. \n                                                 \n4  Some VDCs have no permanent office or updated records. MLD estimates that 1,216 VDC buildings in 44 districts \nwere completely destroyed during the conflict. \n5 Concerns have been expressed about the feasibility of the existing structure and number of local bodies. It is \nestimated that more than 90% of VDCs, 40% of municipalities, and 25% of DDCs depend on government grants \neven for providing an honorarium to elected officials and to cover their basic administrative expenses. \n6 For example, the sectoral allocation of development expenditures in the plan (in 2006\u20132007 constant prices) shows \nthat expenditures for local development are by far the greatest among all sectors (17.53% of total expenditures). \n ", "Appendix 3  39 \n \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX  \n(Major Donors and Relevant Governance Areas) \n \n1.

Introduction \n1.  The  financial  management  arrangements  under  the  Local  Governance  and  \nCommunity Development Program (LGCDP) are fully aligned with the systems and procedures \nof the Government of Nepal (the Government) and will follow the treasury model. Consequently, \nthe fiduciary risk assessment (FRA)1 focuses on Nepal\u2019s country systems for public financial \nmanagement (PFM) and procurement. Since roughly 63% of funding from development partners \nwill be used to finance an expanded block grant (EBG),2 the FRA will specifically look into the \nrisks attached to the management and administration of that grant by local bodies. Finally, the \nFRA will include some observations on the program budget.  \n \nB.  Fiduciary Risks at the National Level \n2.  Nepal\u2019s legal and regulatory framework for PFM ranks amongst the best that can be \nfound in developing countries, but the gap between that solid framework and its practical \nimplementation is large at all stages of the budget cycle. The resulting fiduciary risk environment \nis assessed as high. As highlighted in the public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) \nassessment,  development  partners  have  been  responding  to  fiduciary  risks  by  by-passing \nnational systems rather than addressing the risks inherent in them.3 A promising feature of the \nrecent PEFA exercise is that it includes an action plan, which is currently prioritized by the \nFinancial Comptroller General\u2019s Office (FCGO)4 and is expected to be available by end-2008. \nThe action plan provides a platform on which to base a coherent approach to PFM reforms.   \n \n3.  Table A4.1 highlights the PEFA indicators and proposed mitigating actions that are \nespecially relevant to the LGCDP. The proposed risk-mitigation measures either reflect the \naction plan that is attached to the PEFA assessment or the risk-mitigation measures that have \nbeen included in the LGCDP document.  \n

Fiduciary Risks at the Local Level: EBG and MCPM System  \n4.  The EBG and the minimum conditions and performance measures (MCPM) system5 \nrepresent the first systematic and nationwide approach to promote good governance, notably \nincluding prudent local PFM.6  The EBG is unconditional7 and will thus increase the volume of \n                                                 \n5  Details of the MCPM system and the EBG are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n6  Component 2 of the LGCDP is a nationwide roll out of the MCPM pilot, which has been successfully tried in 25 \ndistricts since fiscal year 2005. The Government subsequently decided to introduce the system for all local bodies. \n7  The term \u201cunconditional\u201d is used to denote the multi-sectoral nature of the EBG, which distinguishes it from the \nwide array of conditional sector-specific grants currently transferred to the districts. However, \u201cunconditional\u201d does \nnot mean that there are no constraints on the use of the grant. First, these constraints are provided by the legal \nand regulatory framework for financial management and administration, including requirements relating to the \npreparation of annual plans and budgets. Further constraints are then provided by the application of the MCPM \nsystem, which promotes compliance with existing rules and regulations. \n ", "Appendix 4  43 \n \ndiscretionary resources under the direct purview of DDCs. Its key feature, however, is that \nactual allocation is never an entitlement but subject to compliance with minimum conditions and \nthen further fixed in accordance with an annual performance assessment. The actual size of the \ngrant is thus adapted to proven performance capacity in key functional areas, mainly relating to \nPFM, and so provides fiscal incentives for compliance with the existing legal and regulatory \nframework that guides the operations of local bodies. This means that, by design, the MCPM \nsystem substantially mitigates local fiduciary risks.   \n \n5.  A second risk-mitigating feature of the EBG is that its basic allocation is based on a clear \nand  transparent  formula.  This  positively  distinguishes  the  EBG  from  the  vast  majority  of \nconditional grants that flow into districts and are not formula based, and are thus open to \nunwarranted discretion in their allocation.  \n \n6.   Minimum conditions are the basic fiduciary safeguard in the system. Local bodies that \nfail to meet any of the minimum conditions are ineligible to receive funds under the EBG in the \ncoming fiscal year, except for a notional amount that will allow them to perform certain key \nactivities. The minimum conditions address three functional areas:8 (i) planning and budgeting, \n(ii) financial management and administration, and (iii) transparency requirements.  \n \n7.  Performance measures determine whether local bodies will receive a reward on top of \ntheir basic allocation or be sanctioned. The performance measures cover eight functional areas: \n(i) planning and program management, (ii) budget management, (iii) financial management, (iv) \nfiscal  effort,  (v)  budget  release  and  program  implementation,  (vi)  communication  and \ntransparency,  (vii)  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  (viii)  internal  organization  and  asset \nmanagement.

Quality  Assurance  and  Corruption.  The  LGCDP  has  introduced  several  quality-\nassurance measures to safeguard the integrity of the MCPM system, i.e., to rule out corruption \nin the assessment process and/or the allocation of the corresponding block grants. First, the \nallocation of the block grant is done on the basis of a clear and transparent formula. Second, the \nannual assessment of local bodies is contracted out to the private sector following existing \nregulations  for  national  competitive  bidding.  Third,  the  indicators  that  are  used  to  assess \nminimum conditions and performance levels are all taken from existing legal and regulatory \nframeworks, thus minimizing discretion in the assessment. Fourth, assessments are carried out \nin  the  presence  of  representatives  from  MLD  or  LBFC,  who  will  have  to  sign  off  on  the \nassessment report. Fifth, the results of the assessment are vetted and summarized by LBFC, \nand the corresponding allocations are forwarded to the MCPM supervision committee for final \nendorsement.  Sixth,  local  bodies  are  allowed  to  appeal  against  the  outcome  of  the \n                                                 \n8  After the reinstatement of elected local governments, a fourth area will focus on the functioning of political \ncommittees. \n ", "44  Appendix 4 \n \n \nassessment.9 Finally, both the results of the annual assessments and the corresponding block \ngrant are announced in local and national media such as newspapers and radio.  \n \n9.  Equitable Utilization of the Block Grant. Several requirements ensure the socially \ninclusive and gender-responsive utilization of the EBG. These include (i) the poverty orientation \nof the allocation formula;10 (ii) the proposed mandatory requirement to reserve 20% of the \ndistrict level EBGs for investments directly benefiting women and disadvantaged groups (DAGs); \n(iii) the proposed prioritization in VDCs of investments that benefit women, children, DAGs, and \nthe disabled; (iv) support for a range of community-driven initiatives like public and social audits \nand public hearings; (v) special support to DAGs and/or the organizations representing them to \nstrengthen their interaction with and voice in local governance, including their ability to set own \npriorities and attain resources to fund them; and (vi) support to existing district coordination \ncommittees of Dalits, Janajatis, and women. \n \nD.  Fiduciary Risks at the Program Level \n10.  National Program Budget. The budget has generally been well prepared, and the rigor \nof the overall estimates of required resources cannot be questioned. In particular, the estimates \nwith regard to the top-up part of component 2, representing roughly 63% of development partner \ncontributions, have been well worked out on the bases of clear and justifiable assumptions. With \nregard to components 1 and 3, however, there are several budget line items that need further \nclarification. The Government has committed to providing the needed clarity in the form of \na \u201dnote to budget,\u201d in which the assumptions underlying the various line items will be detailed. \nThe budget assumptions will be further reviewed and necessary reallocations across budget line \nitems will be done at the end of the inception phase of the LGCDP at end-2008, in keeping with \nthe agreed strategies, action plans, and program approaches that will have been developed by \nthen. Finally, one of the conditions for the release of the second tranche funds concerns the \nfinalization of the JFA, which will be informed by a comprehensive, program-specific FRA. \n \n11.  Insufficient Funding. The risk that sufficient funds may not be available is mitigated by \n(i) the Government\u2019s commitment to the LGCDP of $260.8 million and (ii) the intent of several \ndevelopment partners to support the program under a single programmatic framework and the \nJFA, which is clearly stated in a letter of intent signed by development partners.  \n \n12.  Risk Mitigation Measures for the First Tranche. A substantial part of the first tranche \nwill be used to finance the top-up of the existing grants and will thus be subjected to the risk \nmitigation measures provided by the MCPM system. Government has already endorsed a fund-\nflow mechanism that will allow for the direct transfer of funds from the FCGO to the District \nTreasury Control Office, thus reducing the scope for delays and possible leakages in the system. \nThird, ADB has specified in its program document its right to audit the use of grant proceeds \nand to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification for each withdrawal. \n \n13.  ADB has sought and received an assurance from the Government that it will continue to \nengage  on  the  FRA  and  mitigating  measures  so  that  the  program  can  be  substantially \nstrengthened. Further details on the fiduciary risk assessment can be found in Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n                                                 \n9  If so, another assessment team will be tasked to verify the complaints; if valid, the result will be changed as \nneeded; if not, the costs associated with the reassessment will be deducted from the local body\u2019s EBG allocation. \n10 The EBG is allocated by (i) population (40%); (ii) land area (10%); (iii) poverty and fiscal need (25%), according to \nthe human development index weighted by population; and (iv) cost index (25%), weighted against expenditure \nneeds criteria. \n ", "Appendix 5  45 \n \n \nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER AND POLICY MATRIX \n \n \n \n \n ", "46  Appendix 5 \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 5  47 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

This conceptualization of the program cluster approach toward supporting reforms in \nlocal governance and community development has been shared with the Government and \ndevelopment partners. The Government concurs that it is aligned with its own vision of local \ngovernance reforms in the present context.

Provision has already been made in the Country Programming \nMission (2008) for subprogram 2, which the Government has endorsed. \nb  Including own revenue of local bodies. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n2.  Regarding the program cluster modality of providing support to the local governance and \ncommunity  development  sector,  it  is  essential  to  discuss  the  tentative  outcomes  and \ncomponents, including policy directions of subprogram 2. These are detailed in Table A6.2.1 \n \nTable A6.2: Tentative Outline of SP2 on Local Governance and Community Development \nReforms \nArea of  Details \nFocus \nRationale for  Local governance and community development is complex in any jurisdiction; in Nepal, it is even \nSP2  more so as the country debates the structure of a new Nepal, one in which a federal form of \ngovernment will replace the existing one. The first cluster of support in this regard focuses primarily \non local governance and community development (i.e., with a much more local focus). Once the \nfederal structure is in place, hopefully in the next 3\u20134 years, a program will be needed to sustain the \nnew political arrangement. SP2 provides it, and cueing the Government now about the program to \ncome 4 years later will hopefully enable a better and more rigorous program. \n \nAssumptions  The Government will be able to continue reforms in this sector under the following assumptions: (i) \npolitical stability at the center, (ii) the maintenance of peace, (iii) the constitutional basis of state \nrestructuring complete or well under way, (iv) institutional realignment to support local governance, \n(v) strong central level policy coordination to support local governance, and (vi) all preparations for \nlocal elections done or the elections themselves completed. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  This is a tentative formulation, and the Government has confirmed that a separate programming mission will have \nto be fielded prior to the end of subprogram I to finalize the program objectives and components, including program \nimplementation and funding arrangements. \n ", "Appendix 6    53\n \nArea of  Details \nFocus \nObjectives  The  objectives  of  SP2  are  to  support  the  Government  in  strengthening  the  federal  form  of \ngovernment with its consequent impact on ensuring that subnational governments continue to be \naccountable and to provide services effectively and inclusively. One of the objectives of SP2 is to \nensure a strong central Government, since its role in a federal state will vary dramatically from what \nit is currently.  \n \nPolicy directions: Policy directions that will be reflected in SP2 include the following: \nGender  Stronger focus on gender equality, as evident in the mainstreaming of these issues in government \nequality  operations, including at the local level. To this end, the gender-equality focus of SP1 will remain \n  relevant, including the GESI strategy developed in SP1. \nSocial  Social mobilization will continue to be the primary means to raise the awareness of disadvantaged \nmobilization  groups that may still be left out of the impacts of SP1. Social mobilization is expected to continue to \n  be both holistic across spatial units and targeted on particular communities and themes. \nDevolution  Devolution  is  expected  to  be  the  primary  state  mechanism  for  center\u2013local  relations,  having \n  replaced the narrow focus on decentralization, if the political leadership is willing to be bold and the \ncurrent ideas on federalism (i.e., fewer VDCs and replacing DDCs with provinces) are put into \npractice. \n \nCommunity  Community development and inclusiveness are expected to go hand-in-hand, and the policy bases \ndevelopment,  for this will be various proclamations made recently by the Government. The term \u201dinclusiveness\u201d \nand inclusive- will likely have been better nuanced so that local governments and others are aware of how to \nness  emphasize it in their work. \n   \nGood  Good governance centrally and locally will continue to be the mainstay of the political economy in \ngovernance  SP2.  In  particular,  notions  of  transparency,  accountability,  participation,  and  rights-based \napproaches to development are expected to be the focus in SP2. Accountability in particular is likely \nto take on a political hue as local elections will likely have been completed either by the start of SP2 \nor during its initial years. \n \nService  Service delivery will continue to be the primary focus of SP2 because the functions of local bodies \ndelivery  will not have shifted even in a federal form of government. It is arguable, though, that there may well \nbe other service providers encouraged to enter the sector. \nLocal  Policy directions in local financing are expected to be geared toward ensuring that (i) local bodies \nfinancing  have  greater  access  to  own-source  revenues,  (ii)  performance  grants  continue  to  be  key  in \nrewarding local bodies that do well, and (iii) a greater degree of equalization among local bodies will \nbe evident, as this is currently skewed toward districts in the south and with urban pockets. \nStructural and  Functional  During SP2, the functions of local governments, as they are expected to have \nfunctional  allocation and  graduated from being local bodies to being governments following local elections, \nadjustment  accountability  are expected to be exclusive. In other words, only what the central Government \n  does will be specified, and everything else will be the responsibility of local \ngovernments. In such a scenario, local governments will be solely accountable for \nservice  delivery  and  other  functions  of  the  state  at  the  local  level.  The \naccountability  of  the  central  Government  will  be  restricted  to  the  macro \nenvironment of policy coordination, monitoring support, etc. \n \nBy the inception of SP2, the country will likely have determined the nature of the \nfederal form of government, including the number and design of provincial and \nlocal governments. This will facilitate subnational planning.  \n \nLocal  Given  the  assumption  of  greater  authority  and  accountability  of  subnational \ngovernment  governments during SP2, review of their performance will be carried out by (i) the \nperformance  governments themselves through the usual self-review  mechanisms such as \nreview  audits, etc.; (ii) civil society and other nongovernment entities that will use the \nmechanism  results of tools such as citizen card surveys, public and social audits, public \n ", " 54  Appendix 6 \n \n \nArea of  Details \nFocus \nhearings, etc., to demand better performance from local governments; and (iii) the \ncentral  Government  in  specific  cases,  such  as  when  conditional  funds  are \ntransferred for a particular infrastructure project, to ensure that resources are \nused effectively and accountably. \n \nChanges to  During  SP2,  there  will  likely  be  some  significant  changes  in  the  legal  and \nlaws and  regulatory bases of local government work. The new constitution that is to be \nregulations  drafted will specify a federal form of government. Specific laws that will have been \n  amended or promulgated anew include the Local Self-Governance Act, the Local \n(Government) Service Act, and others that will relate to the powers of local \ngovernments to carry out their work independent of control from the center. \nProcurement  regulations  may  undergo  amendments,  as  they  currently  have \nseveral weaknesses.  \n \nTentative  As  ADB  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  reform  efforts  in  local  governance  and  community \npolicy actions  development using a program cluster approach, a tentative set of policy actions for the second \nfor SP2  cluster program could include the following: \n1.  All central sectoral line agencies such as health, education, transport, agriculture, etc., will have \nundertaken a business process reengineering exercise to better align their functions and \noperations with the requirements of a federal system of government, with particular respect to \nsectoral devolution to local governments. \n2.  The intergovernmental fiscal and administrative system will have been reviewed and amended \nto remove bottlenecks and allow local governments to operate more effectively. \n3.  The legal and statutory framework of local governments will have been clarified, and there will \nbe no loopholes in the legal bases of their functions and powers. \n4.  A Local (Government) Service Act will have been promulgated, specifying the manner in which \nlocal governments can manage their own human resources. \n5.  Midlevel agencies such as the Association of District Development Committees in Nepal, \nMunicipality Association of Nepal, and National Association of Village Development Committees \nin Nepal\u2014or whatever local government associations will be in place then, in keeping with the \nform of subnational governments\u2014will be strengthened to provide policy  and operational \nsupport to local governments. \n6.  Local service delivery mechanisms will have been strengthened. \n7.  Community organizations, particularly of disadvantaged communities and women\u2019s groups, will \ncontinue to be strengthened so that they can better engage local governments. \n8.  The MCPM system of fiscal transfers to local governments will have been reviewed and refined, \nkeeping  in  mind  the  policies  that  will  be  in  place  to  strengthen  intergovernmental  fiscal \ntransfers. There is apt to be some form of central grant system, and the MCPM system is \nexpected to continue to play a key role in providing incentives to local governments to perform. \n \nThese tentative policy actions based on the situation during SP1 are expected to be the focus of \nSP2. They will undergo fundamental review as SP1 draws to a close. \n  \nDDC = district development committee, GESI = gender equality and social inclusion, MCPM = minimum \nconditions and performance measures, SP1 = subprogram 1, SP2 = subprogram 2, VDCs = village development \ncommittees. \na  This will be developed and confirmed toward the end of subprogram 1, with the results of the subprogram 1 \nmidterm evaluation in mind.

At the Center \n1.  Program Management \n \n1.  The Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP) will be executed \nby the Ministry of Local Development (MLD), which will take overall responsibility for the program \nand establish a national advisory committee (NAC) for policy advocacy and coordinating and \nsupervising  the  program,  as  well  as  for  making  strategic  recommendations  concerning  its \nimplementation. NAC will be chaired by the secretary of MLD and will consist of the MLD\u2019s joint \nsecretaries, the director general of the Department of Local Infrastructure and Agricultural Roads \nand representatives of relevant line ministries, including the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction \nand  the  Ministry  of  Women;  development  partners;  and  local  body  associations.  The  joint \nsecretary of the Local Governance Coordination Division will be the national program director and \nact as member-secretary for the committee. The committee will meet at least twice a year. \n \n2.  A program coordination unit (PCU) has been established under the Local Governance \nCoordination Division of MLD and ensures the internal coordination of policy activities related to \nthe LGCDP through the policy coordination committee (PCC), which already exists in MLD. The \nLGCDP will be managed full-time by an under secretary from MLD, acting as program manager \nand heading the PCU on a daily basis, who will report to the national program director, who will \nreport in turn to the MLD secretary and the NAC. \n \n3.  The PCU will have dedicated output managers for each of the seven program outputs, \nselected from among the various section chiefs in MLD who will be PCU members. This will \nintroduce  a  degree  of  accountability  internally  in  MLD  in  terms  of  results-based  output \nmanagement  (see  Figure  A7).  PCU  output  managers  will  meet  monthly  to  discuss  issues \nregarding program implementation, and the PCU will prepare trimesterly progress reports. Once \nthe JFA is in place, the PCU will prepare annual work plans and budgets and present them to the \nNAC. The work plans and budgets will be linked to Government systems and based on the Local \nSelf-Governance Act (LSGA) and Local Bodies Financial Administration Regulations (LBFAR). \nThe PCU will be responsible for drawing up procurement plans in accordance with the 2007 \nProcurement Act and Regulations. \n \n4.  The PCU will include a technical cell made up of full-time national specialists in capacity \nbuilding, financial and fiscal decentralization, social mobilization, gender and social inclusion, \nprocurement, information and communication technology, geographic information systems, and \nmonitoring and evaluation. These technical specialists will work under the daily supervision of the \nprogram manager and provide output managers with technical assistance and advice. They will \nact as resource persons to the working committee of the decentralization implementation and \nmonitoring  committee,  as  provided  for  under  the  LSGA.  Augmenting  the  full-time  national \ntechnical  specialists,  the  PCU  will  draw  on  international  expertise  as  necessary  to  provide \ntechnical core expertise to its staff. The PCU team will be housed in MLD premises. \n \n5.  The  PCU  will  include,  at  least  for  the  first  2  years  of  program  implementation,  two \nmanagement specialists, one to provide MLD with support for procurement according to the \nprovisions of the 2007 Procurement Act and related regulations, and the other to provide MLD\u2019s \nGeneral  Administration  Division  with  support  for  program-related  financial  management \n(consolidated reports, withdrawal applications, etc.). \n \n ", "56   Appendix 7 \n \n \n6.

In Districts, Municipalities and Villages \n7.  The LGCDP will operate through existing modalities locally. The local development officer \nwill coordinate the LGCDP in districts, the executive officer in municipalities, and secretaries in \nvillage development committees (VDCs). The program will be integrated into the local bodies\u2019 \nplans, and district development committee (DDC), municipal, and VDC councils will approve their \nrespective program action plans. Finally, the integrated plan formulation committee of the DDCs \nwill be expanded with representatives of political parties, civil society organizations, chairman\u2013 \nmanagement committees, and user committees to work as program implementation committees. \nLPCs will continue to rely on the Office of the Chief District Officer for support and work together \nwith that Office and DDCs. \n \nC.  Program Implementation Through Social Mobilization \n8.  Social mobilization is central to managing and implementing the LGCDP. It is a key part of \ncomponent 1 in the LGCDP and the principal means of empowering communities and community-\nbased organizations. Specific provisions in the LGCDP for this include that (i) DDCs will contract \nout social mobilization services to appropriate institutions in the private sector and civil society, \netc., based on competitive processes; (ii) a comprehensive social mobilization training program \nand operational manual will be designed, and all service providers and social mobilizers will be \ntrained and provided with an operational manual toward ensuring a common approach; (iii) robust \noutcome-based monitoring of the performance of social mobilization service providers will be put \nin place, with poor performance and failure to achieve the outcomes being accompanied by \nsanctions; (iv) new VDC and municipality wards will be selected on the bases of disadvantaged \ngroup  (DAG)  mapping  using  tools  already  developed  by  MLD;  (v)  DDCs  will  map  social \nmobilization agencies\u2019 coverage and methodologies, etc., and assess their performance and \npotential;  and  (vi)  VDCs  will  target  the  most  disadvantaged  and  poorest  families  by  using \nappropriate criteria. \n \n9.  The social mobilizers\u2019 primary functions will be to strengthen local voice and local groups\u2019 \nand communities\u2019 active participation in decision making on the use of block grants and ability to \nhold local bodies and service delivery agencies accountable. A community-led social development \napproach will strengthen community participation in local governance. The program\u2019s socially \nmobilized groups will be able to influence the use of block grants and, in many cases, be the \nimplementing body in the production of goods and services by engaging with the regular local \nplanning and budgeting process.  \n \n10.  Social  mobilization  methods  will  ensure  social  inclusion  to  enable  citizens  from \ndisadvantaged  groups  to  participate  in  public  affairs  by  interacting  with  local  bodies,  public \nservices,  and  other  agencies.  Addressing  the  structural  causes  of  inequality  and  exclusion \nrequires both changes in the formal rules by which local bodies and service providers operate and \nthe more challenging transformation in people\u2019s attitudes and behavior. This may require targeted \nsocial mobilization, which the LGCDP recognizes. At the same time, the LGCDP will ensure that \nthis targeted social mobilization approach does not result in the exclusion or alienation of better-\noff or privileged members of the wider community, who may become resentful or obstructive. \n \n11.  This social mobilization intervention will focus on the wider capacity of communities and \ndisadvantaged groups to articulate their needs and priorities and exercise their rights in regard to \nlocal administration. This will be undertaken by supporting (i) communities with resources and \ntechnical support for funding their development priorities or pooling with others; (ii) communities\u2019 \nright to prioritize their needs and the methods by which to attain their developmental outcomes; (iii) \n ", "58   Appendix 7 \n \n \ninformation  and  awareness  campaigns  on  local  governance  issues,  using  innovative, \nunconventional approaches; (iv) the dissemination of local body plans, budgets, and expenditures, \netc.; (v) support to public and social audits and public hearings, etc.; (vi) training and support to \nthe local and national media to ensure more informed and active reporting of local governance \nissues; and (vii) support for surveys tracking public expenditure and the dissemination of findings. \nOnce the interim local bodies are established, a key activity will be training and guiding them in \nthe basics of responsible local governance and government\u2013community relations. \n ", "  Appendix 7  59\nTable A7: Program Implementation Schedule \n \n2008 (month)  2009  2010  2011  2012  \nComponent, Subcomponent, Activity\n(July\u2013Dec) (qtrs) (qtrs) (qtrs) (qtrs)\n1.

The Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nspecifies  that  program  design  should  incorporate  findings  of  governance,  institutional,  and \ncorruption risks assessments, and that program documentation clearly identify risk and risk \nmanagement and mitigation measures. Accordingly, this assessment considers potential risks in \nsupporting a program in the particular sector and relevant mitigation measures.2  \n \nA.  Nature of Risks in Subprogram 1 \n \n2.  Discussions with the Government of Nepal (the Government), development partners, \nand other stakeholders reveal six specific vectors of risks and vulnerabilities in the program.3 \nThere is agreement that, while there could be more risks, these constitute a particular challenge \nfor  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Local  Governance  and  Community  Development \nProgram (LGCDP). \n \n3.  Vector 1: Legislative and Policy Framework. The overarching legal framework on \nlocal governance is the 1999 Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) and the Local Body Financial \nAdministration Regulations, 1999. The LSGA needs to be amended swiftly, as it contravenes \nvarious other Acts. Another vulnerability in the legislative framework is the absence of a Local \n(Government) Service Act, which means that human resource management for local bodies \ncontinues to be under the control of the center. \n \n4.  Vector  2:  Institutional  Dimensions. Across the board, the capacity of the various \ninstitutions that will be involved in the program is weak. This ranges from the central agencies \nsuch as the MLD to the midlevel agencies, including public sector training service providers \nsuch as the Local Development Training Academy and more local entities such as village \ndevelopment committees (VDCs). Not only does the physical infrastructure need repair, but the \nweak technical expertise of local body staff members and the frequent transfer of field-based \nstaff pose vulnerabilities. These institutions and the Ministry of Local Development (MLD) are \nalso under-resourced and unable to carry out their mandates effectively. That legal provisions in \nthe Civil Service Act with respect to policies and rules on staff transfers are not adhered to \nexacerbates these vulnerabilities. \n \n5.  Vector 3: Government Business Processes. Two main vulnerabilities are (i) general \nweaknesses  in  specific  and  relevant  government  business  processes,  such  as  public \nprocurement,  and  the  consequent  vulnerability  to  corruption  and  mismanagement,  and  (ii) \nopaque business processes related to central\u2013local relations, such as uneasy and often unclear \nrelationships among line agencies at the center, their field level offices, and local bodies. The \nProcurement Act has been gazetted, and relevant regulations prepared, to address the former \nvulnerability, but government officials with experience and expertise in implementing the new \nprovisions, especially subnationally, are absent. With respect to the latter vulnerability, there \ncontinue to be overlaps and inconsistencies in relationships, which have hindered effective local \nservice delivery. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II). Manila. \n2  Discussions with the Government on this risk assessment have taken place during the fact-finding and appraisal \nmissions. It has also been shared with development partners at both stages. The Government has engaged \nextensively with the mission on this assessment and has agreed on the need to continue to do so to better address \nthe risks (see Supplementary Appendix F for a detailed governance risk assessment). \n3  The sixth, on fiduciary risks, is discussed separately in Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix D. \n ", "  Appendix 9  63 \n6.  Vector 4: Accountability and Transparency. Disadvantaged groups are not able to \nhold local bodies accountable for poor, ineffective service delivery. Some measures have been \ntaken to improve the transparency of local body operations but are considered inadequate. \nAnother serious risk is gaps in accountability and transparency regarding the use of resources. \nMismanagement  of  resources  and  the  broader  fiduciary  risks  of  intergovernmental  fiscal \ntransfers constitute particular risks that the program will have to deal with.4 \n \n7.  Vector 5: Program-Related. The political situation may jeopardize the sustainability of \nthe policy reforms. One risk could be rising fuel and food prices that will indirectly but certainly \naffect fund transfers to local bodies, particularly at a time of strong expectations of a greater \nshare  of  such  transfers  from  the  center.  Program  management  and  implementation \narrangements also contain some weaknesses such as unclear protocols for reporting from \nvillages  to  the  center.  An  under-appreciated  risk  is  the  management  of  expectations  with \nrespect  to  the  program.  There  are  currently  phenomenal  expectations  of  the  incoming \ngovernment, and not all of them are realistic. The risk is that failure to achieve even a fraction of \nexpectations may create a backlash against the reform process.  \n \nB.  Risk Severity \n \n8.  Analyzing the severity of risks is necessarily imprecise, though both the Government and \ndevelopment  partners have  continually  engaged  in  this exercise.  The  severity  of  the  risks \nidentified in the five vectors can be categorized under four types, with types 1 and 2 being the \nmost  severe  (see  Table  A9  and,  for  more  detail  and  description  of  the  methodology, \nSupplementary Appendix F). This review focuses only on selected type 1 and type 2 risks.  \n \nTable A9: Severity of Selected Risks \nVector of  Types of Risk \nRisks  Type 1  Type 2 \nVector 1.    \u2022  Weak LSGAa \nLegislative and  \u2022  Absence of Local (Government) Service Act \npolicy framework   \nVector 2.  \u2022  Weak capacity of MLD  \u2022  Weak midlevel agencies and associated \nInstitutional  \u2022  Weak local bodies  institutions \ndimensions     \nVector 3.  \u2022  Lack of clarity on mandates, authority,  \u2022  Weakness related to government business \nGovernment  and sphere of control among different  process, e.g., on procurement \nbusiness  agencies   \nprocesses \nVector 4.  \u2022  Absence of voice for marginalized  \u2022  Vestiges of opaqueness in local body work \nAccountability and  populations \ntransparency  \u2022  Fiduciary risks in fund flow and usage \nVector 5.

This is analyzed in detail in Supplementary Appendix D. \n ", "64  Appendix 9 \nC.  Risk Mitigation Measures \n \n9.  Many  of  the  mitigation  measures  for  the  risks  listed  above  are  already  in  place. \nMitigation measures for selected type 1 risks can be detailed as follows. \n \n10.  Weaknesses in Institutions. This is inherently a type I risk, and the program will need \nto  ensure  that  adequate  resources  and  provisions  are  made  for  strengthening  institutions. \nDevelopment partners have pledged significant resources for strengthening local bodies and \nprocesses within MLD. Active engagement will need to continue with central and local agencies \nto ensure that resources are used judiciously and effectively. Close performance monitoring will \nbe necessary to help reduce the negative effects of implementation delays caused by capacity \nconstraints. Assistance should also be provided to MLD to ensure that the LSGA is amended \nswiftly and that the Local (Government) Service Act drafted promptly. Finally, closer compliance \nwith existing legal provisions, such as the Civil Service Act and its rules and policies, the Right \nto Information Act, etc., will strengthen institutions. Finally, the Government will need to be \nsupported to ensure that all legal provisions (e.g., on the Civil Service Act, etc.) are complied \nwith. \n \n11.  Marginalized  Populations  and  Voice.  This  is  a  critical  vulnerability.  The  program \nmakes  considerable  provisions  to  ensure  that  holistic  and  targeted  social  mobilization  will \nempower marginalized groups and that they will be supported financially to engage local bodies \nregarding ineffective service delivery. Local bodies themselves will be monitored to ensure that \nthey respond adequately to inputs from marginalized groups.  \n \n12.  Fiduciary Risks. This is a general risk that exists in policy reform programs. It can be \nmitigated partly by ring-fencing specific levels of program funds for specific policy reform actions \nand  then  following  up  rigorously  during  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Two  such  ring-fencing \nmeasures  have  been  put  in  place,  one  for  local  peace  committees  and  the  other  for \nimplementing  the  social  and  environmental  safeguards  in  the  program.  Civil  society  and \nnongovernment organizations can be involved in monitoring and evaluation, thereby applying \nindependent pressure on the Government to ensure that resources are spent as planned. In the \nLGCDP,  this  is  proposed  through  a  Local  Governance  and  Accountability  Facility.  The \nGovernment has initiated a system of flow of funds to local bodies that minimizes the role of \nMLD for a more direct fund-flow mechanism. Finally, there is now greater attention paid to \ntransparency in this fund flow.5 \n \nD.  Recommendations  \n \n13.  This assessment puts forth a few risk-mitigating measures that have been incorporated \ninto the LGCDP. The Government has agreed to continue to engage with ADB on monitoring \nthe  severity  of  the  risks  and  ensure  that  mitigation  efforts  will  be  a  key  part  of  program \nimplementation.  Other  risk-mitigation  measures  have  been  incorporated  in  program \ndocumentation as program conditions and assurances with Government commitment. Finally, it \nis recommended that risks be subject to continual monitoring.  \n \n \n                                                 \n5  It is now mandatory that the basis for awarding a contract of more than NRs60 million be published in newspapers, \nand the annual progress and financial statements of projects must be made public within 4 months of the end of the \nfiscal year. Other measures demand that (i) budget authorization of development programs issued from the \nministries to district offices be published in national newspapers; (ii) line agencies ensure the monthly publication of \nincome and expenditure of their sister offices and grant-receiving offices; and (iii) the physical and financial \nprogress of priority projects be published. \n ", "  Appendix 10  65 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: NEP: Governance Support Program Cluster (Subprogram I) \n \nSouth  Asia  Department/ \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nPolicy-Based  Governance, Finance and \nModality:  Division: \nTrade Division/SAGF \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThere is a clear link between the Governance Support Program (GSP) and the Government\u2019s national poverty \nreduction strategy, as contained in the Three-Year Interim Plan (TYIP) (2008\u20132010) and the Nepal country \npartnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).a The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is, \nin  the  first  instance  and  for  the  short  term,  geared  toward  ensuring  a  smooth  transition  to  a  modern, \ndemocratic, and federal state. The TYIP reaffirms that for this to happen local governance needs to be \nrestructured, peace efforts should be solidified locally, and the problem of low institutional capacity in local \nbodies needs to be addressed. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nTwo key issues that contextualize the poverty aspects of local governance are the following: \n(i)  Voice Mechanism. The contribution of strong local governance to poverty reduction is well documented. \nGood governance creates an institutional environment characterized by the principles of accountability, \ntransparency, predictability, and participation. This gives the poor a say in decision making in local \nbodies and in how services are delivered. This voice mechanism ensures that local bodies become \nmore responsive, which is an important link between good local governance and poverty reduction.  \n(ii)  Capacity Building. One key component of effective service delivery by local bodies is their capacity to \ndo so. As managerial and executive leadership in local bodies is deputed from the center, local \nexpertise is not developed. This needs to be adequately dealt with in any program that seeks to \nenhance effective and inclusive service delivery through accountable local bodies. \n \n2. Design Features \n \nSubprogram 1 (SP1) of the GSP (i) supports the Government as it prepares, for the first time, a sector-wide \napproach to local development programming; (ii) employs the minimum conditions and performance measures \n(MCPM) tool to reward good performance by local bodies (Appendix 4); (iii)  supports more effective local \ngovernance through midlevel organizations; (iv) adheres to the harmonized approach to community-led local \ndevelopment agreed to by all development partners in early 2008; and (v) is wholly aligned with the outcomes \nand new initiatives of the Government in the areas of local governance and community development.  \n \nIn  addition,  the  Local  Governance  and  Community  Development  Program  (LGCDP)  component  on \nstrengthening the national framework includes several important features that further the Government\u2019s intent \nto  adhere  to  the  provisions  in  the  Interim  Constitution  related  to  devolution,  state  restructuring,  and \ninclusiveness. A pro-poor feature of SP1 is the attention paid to inclusive service delivery, which will ensure \nthat historically disadvantaged groups and other segments of society have a say in local governance, including \nholding service providers accountable.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "66   Appendix 10 \nC.

Findings of Social Analysis  \n \n  Key Issues \n \nThe key socioeconomic issues that are evident in SP1 deal with the impact of mismanagement of public \nresources by local bodies that harms local people, largely through poor service delivery and greater costs for \naccessing services. This further marginalizes disadvantaged groups and perpetuates mistrust in government. \nWhile mismanagement and poor service delivery by local bodies cannot be completely done away with, \nparticularly in the time period specified in the LGCDP, SP1\u2013in line with the LGCDP\u2013attempts to improve the \ncapability of local bodies to be more in tune with popular demands and make them more accountable to service \nusers.  This  is  expected  to  have  positive  economic  and  social  effects,  including  greater  public  trust  in \ngovernment. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \nStakeholder groups engaged in the formulation process of SP1 and the LGCDP include central policy makers, \nmidlevel actors, and local officials and civil society groups.b The questions discussed in the consultations \nincluded the following: (i) What outcomes should a program on strengthening local governance and community \ndevelopment focus on? (ii) How should the program be structured so that it is aligned with, and contributes \nsubstantially to, the Government\u2019s vision? (ii) How can development partners be coordinated? (iii) What is the \nbest way to mainstream successful initiatives such as in social mobilization and come up with new ones? (iv) \nHow can commitment from top political and bureaucratic leaders, and ownership by local communities, be \nsecured? \n \nMoving forward, the consultation and participation processes will involve ensuring that SP1, through the \nnational advisory committee at MLD, is substantially engaged with the Government to ensure alignment with its \nstated outcomes and vision. \n \nWhat level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaboration       Empowerment \n \nWas a consultation and participation plan prepared?

Introduction \n \n1.  The premise of the gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan is that \nsubprogram 1 (SP1) of the Governance Support Program, which helps the Government of \nNepal (the  Government) to implement its Local Governance and Community  Development \nProgram  (LGCDP),  has  strong  potential  to  have  differential  impact  on  women  and \ndisadvantaged groups (DAGs). While the LGCDP has a dedicated component to strengthening \ncommunity mobilization, it does not necessarily follow that this alone will adequately address the \ndemands and needs of the women and DAGs. \n \nB.  Key Principles and Approaches \n \n2.  The key principles and approaches of the LGCDP that support including GESI concerns \nare (i) affirmative action policies in favor of the poor, women, and DAGs to maximize their \nparticipation in and benefit from the program; (ii) capacity building in leadership and managerial \nskills for women and DAGs (including Dalits, Janajatis, and others) to empower them; (iii) the \nharmonization of procedures for working with communities and for targeting the poorest and \nmost disadvantaged segments of these communities; (iv) a rights-based approach based on \nparticipatory  planning  and  the  development  of  demand-responsive  local  service  providers \nthrough social mobilization and advocacy for civil rights; and (v) special targeted programs and \nmechanisms to ensure that DAGs are covered by the program and that their voices are heard \nthrough participation, empowerment, and access to resources and capacity building. \n \n3.  The  Ministry  of  Local  Development  (MLD)  will  prepare  GESI  strategy  and \nimplementation guidelines for the LGCDP in the inception phase, by January 2009. This GESI \naction plan of SP1 will support incorporating GESI issues in the comprehensive strategy. It lays \nout some specific actions to ensure the inclusion of issues relevant to women and DAGs in all \nthree  program  components.  It  highlights  implementation  arrangements  for  the  plan  and \nprovisions for appropriate monitoring and evaluation (M&E) related to GESI. \n \nC.  Program Design \n4.  Component  1  of  the  LGCDP  specifically  targets  GESI  inclusion,  resulting  from \ninteractions among numerous stakeholders. In particular, outputs 1.1 and 1.2 of the program are \ndirect results of consideration given to GESI issues. The components and targets of the LGCDP \nthat relate to GESI issues are summarized in Table A11. \n \nTable A11: GESI Action Plan for the National Program \nComponent 1: Citizens and Communities Actively Engaged with Local Bodies and Hold Them \nAccountable \nActivities  Targets/Indicators \n\u2022  Develop targeted modalities of SM making it GESI  \u2022  Year-on-year increase in the number of \nresponsive and suitable for highly marginalized caste  disadvantaged groups that utilize program \nand ethnic groups based on differential socioeconomic,  resources to empower themselves \ncultural, geographical dimensions   \u2022  Increased number of social mobilizers;

Implementation Arrangements \n5.  Implementation arrangements in the LGCDP specifically to incorporate GESI provisions \ninclude the (i) inclusion of gender and development specialists in the teams designing the \nLGCDP and developing its relevant strategies; (ii) provision of a GESI specialist in program \ncoordination unit (PCU) for program duration; (iii) provision of GESI specialists and related \nofficers in the PCU for specific technical inputs (e.g., gender budgeting), intermittently based on \nneed;  (iv)  provision  of  gender  focal  points  in  all  local  bodies;  and  (v)  inclusion  of  GESI \nspecialists  in  all  review  teams.  The  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Social  Welfare  and \nDepartment of Women Development (DWD) will be key partners, along with gender focal points \nin each line agency, in ensuring that gender considerations are taken on board by the program. \nThe Women Development Office will be a key local partner, with coordination support from \nDWD.  Women\u2019s  and  DAGs\u2019  community-based  and  nongovernment  organizations  will  be \nidentified to ensure their concerns are reflected in the implementation of the program. The \nWomen\u2019s Development Training Center and Local Development Training Academy will play \nroles in providing training to local women.  \n \n6.  Budget and Capacity Building Provision. While the action plan does not require a \nseparate budget, as it is integrated into the overall program cost, the LGCDP makes particular \nprovisions to ensure that capacity-building opportunities for women and disadvantaged groups \nare facilitated. Budgeting provisions have been incorporated in the LGCDP to ensure this.1  \n \n7.  Monitoring and Evaluation. The LGCDP makes several provisions related to M&E: (i) \nProvisions are made to incorporate GESI indicators in M&E systems such that implementation \narrangements can be continually strengthened depending upon the review results based on the \ngender-sensitive M&E system. (ii) Reporting requirements will be strengthened in the LGCDP \nsuch that specific indicators of program impact can be tracked as they relate to women and \ndisadvantaged groups. (iii) DAG mapping will ensure that more specific monitoring provisions \ncan be built in for areas with a category 4 (most disadvantaged) rating.2 (iv) Finally, provision \nhas been made for women\u2019s and disadvantaged groups to be part of program review. The M&E \nof the action plan will be incorporated into the overall M&E plan developed for all the project \ncomponents. This is to be done in the PCU, which has provision for a GESI specialist and an \nM&E specialist. A midterm evaluation and regular reviews will provide scope for realigning the \nprogram focus so that attention to gender and DAG issues continues to enjoy emphasis. The \nnational advisory committee and the PCU in MLD will be responsible for establishing and \ncoordinating M&E activities.  \n \nD.  Conclusion \n8.  Issues of gender equity and social inclusion have been given central importance in the \nLGCDP, and this has been conveyed to the implementing agencies down to the local level. The \naction plan on GESI will be updated regularly to ensure that any central policy directions are \ntranslated into local practice. In that regard, all output managers in the PCU and members of the \nnational advisory committee will be made familiar with this action plan and its implications for \ntheir own work. \n                                                 \n1  Separately, the Local Development Training Academy will strengthened (out of the purview of the LGCDP but in \nalignment with it) to train female social mobilizers that will, in the short term, be involved in local social mobilization \nand, in the medium term, be the core of a cadre of local body staff that will serve in the districts. This is a unique \nprovision that the Government has been very supportive of. \n2  DAG mapping will be used to ensure that gender-disaggregated data in the baseline surveys are used to assess \nthe gender-differentiated impact of the program. \n ", "  Appendix 12  73 \nSUMMARY SAFEGUARDS FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.

Safeguards on Environmental Impacts \n \n3.  All investments are subject to categorization using the project classification system of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) as well as the Government\u2019s requirements under the \nEnvironmental Protection Act and its regulations.2 The decision as to which classification system \nholds is straightforward: the stricter rule applies (i.e., if ADB\u2019s project classification system \nrecommends a higher level of environmental assessment compared with that resulting from  the \nEnvironmental  Protection  Regulations  (EPR)  screening,  ADB\u2019s  requirement  applies;  on  the \nother hand, if the EPR screening of the subproject gives a stricter requirement compared with \nADB\u2019s, the former applies). \n                                                 \n1  Detailed documentation on the safeguards framework, including all applicable checklists that have been finalized, \nwill be included in the program administration manual after approval of the program. The safeguards document will \nbe used by local bodies as they make investment decisions on usage of the grant funds. \n2  Category A subprojects are those with potential for significant adverse environmental impacts, for which an \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) is needed. Category B subprojects are judged to have some adverse \nenvironmental impacts but of lesser degree and/or significance than those of category A subprojects, and for which \nan initial environmental examination (IEE) is needed. Category C subprojects are unlikely to have adverse \nenvironmental impacts, and no EIA or IEE is needed, but environmental implications are still reviewed. \n ", "74   Appendix 12 \n \n4.

The Environment Management Section of MLD will \nensure smooth communications in district development committees and other stakeholders and \nwill have overall responsibility for ensuring environmental assessments throughout all program \nphases. The Ministry of Science, Environment, and Technology will be responsible for issuing \nnecessary environmental permits or consents for category A subprojects when all conditions are \nmet. ADB will (i) review and clear environmental assessment reports for category A subprojects \nand category B subprojects deemed sensitive and (ii) conduct review missions to monitor the \nimplementation of the environmental management plan. ADB reserves the right to review any \nsubprogram proposal or its EIA or IEE.  \n \nD.  Safeguards on Impacts on Indigenous People \n \n6.  Initial screening of subproject impacts on indigenous peoples will be done to categorize \nthe  impacts  and  identify  subsequent  approaches  and  resource  requirements  to  address \nindigenous issues. A thorough screening will be conducted as part of a subproject\u2019s feasibility \nstudy. Relevant staff in local bodies or external contracted parties, such as nongovernment \norganizations, will be required to identify communities belonging to the various indigenous \ngroups  and  their  characteristics  as  compared  with  the  main  population  in  the  subproject \ninfluence  zone.  The  subprojects  will  be  categorized  as  (i)  category  A,  expected  to  have \nsignificant impacts that require an indigenous peoples development program; (ii) category B, \nexpected  to  have  limited  impacts  that  require  specific  action  for  indigenous  peoples  in \nresettlement plans and/or social action plans; and (iii) category C, not expected to have impacts \non indigenous peoples and therefore not requiring special provision for them.  \n \nE.  Safeguards on Involuntary Resettlement \n \n7.  As most local people will voluntarily donate part of their land for building community and \nrural roads and small-scale rural infrastructure that directly benefit the community, subprojects \nunder the LGCDP are likely to continue, to some extent, the tradition of land donation. However, \nadequate processes and safeguards will be built into the resettlement plan to ensure that land \ndonation is truly voluntary and does not impoverish affected people. Full consultation with \naffected people will occur at site selection and design. \n \n8.   As a first principle, affected people will be informed of their right to compensation for \nany loss of property caused by subproject construction. Affected people will have the right to \nrefuse land donation. Any voluntary land donation will be confirmed through a written record, \nincluding a \"no coercion\" clause verified by an independent third party. The donation will be \nlimited to land and minor assets, with houses and major assets excluded. A grievance redress \ncommittee with representation of affected people will be set up, and affected people who are not \nsatisfied with the land donation can file a complaint with it.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  75 \nF.  Dedicated Resources for Capacity in Applying Safeguards \n \n9.  As  local  bodies,  particularly  VDCs,  do  not  generally  have  capacity  to  conduct \nassessments on their own, the Government has agreed to earmark $1.8 million during the \nprogram period specifically to (i) provide to local bodies technical assistance toward having the \nassessments provided by a third party to deal with short-term capability gaps and (ii) develop \nand finance a capacity-building plan whereby officials of the district technical office and others \nwill be trained in the relevant skills to fill the long-term gaps. The necessary program assurance \nand budgeting provisions have been included in the program document. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081001103639+08'00'", "Author": "MP6", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "governance support program, nepal country partnership strategy, financial management reports, annual strategic implementation plan, nepali economic transformation, nepal local operating environment, nepal govt national system, adb project 36172", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081023115659+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Program Cluster and Grant for Subprogram 1 Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal: Governance Support Program"}}
