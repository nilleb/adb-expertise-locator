The Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor: Power Sector Investment Project1 will \nstrengthen  power  transmission  connectivity  between  the  southern  part  of  the  Chennai\u2013\nKanyakumari Industrial Corridor (CKIC) and the northern part of the CKIC by augmenting the 765 \nkilovolt (kV) and 400 kV networks. This will allow more power including renewable energy to be \nevacuated from new generation facilities in the south CKIC to the energy hungry north CKIC. The \nproject  will  also  enhance  the  institutional  capacity  of  TANTRANSCO  by  (i)  supporting  the \nimplementation of a financial restructuring plan (FRP) to restore the financial sustainability of \nTANTRANSCO; (ii) facilitating the introduction of gender sensitive workplace practices; and (iii) \nbuilding TANTRANSCO\u2019s capacity to monitor the environmental and social impacts of power \ntransmission projects. \n. \n2.  The outputs of the project include:  \n \n(i)  Output 1: Transmission link from southern Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial \nCorridor  to  load  centers  in  northern  Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari  Industrial \nCorridor  established.  This  output  will  establish  a  765  kV  substation  in \nVirudhunagar and 765 kV power transmission link between the power generation \nhub in the Madurai\u2013Thoothukudi area (southern part of the CKIC) and load centers \nin the northern parts of the CKIC. \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Pooling substation established in Thoothukudi District. This \noutput will establish a pooling substation to receive electricity generated \nfrom power plants in the Thoothukudi district.  \n \n(iii)  Output 3:  Financial sustainability and institutional capacity of TANTRASCO \nimproved. To be delivered through this transaction technical assistance (TA), this \noutput will (i) assist Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited (TANTRANSCO) \nin implementing the  financial restructuring plan (FRP) to restore its financial \nsustainability; (ii) support the implementation of a financial management action plan \nto  improve  the  financial  management  capacity  and  corporate  governance  of \nTANTRANSCO; and (iii) facilitate the introduction of gender-sensitive workplace \npractices,  and  (iv)  enhance  the  capacity  of  TANTRANSCO  to  monitor  the \nenvironmental and social impacts of transmission projects. \n \n3.  The main project is estimated to cost $700,000 million. The government has asked the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a loan of $451 million to finance the supply and \ninstallation  cost  of  the  substations  and  transmission  lines  included  in  the  project.  The \nimplementing  agency  (TANTRANSCO)  will  mobilize  counterpart  funds  amounting  to \n$202.5 million to pay compensation for right-of-way for transmission lines, land acquisition for \nsubstations, financial charges during implementation, and project management expenses.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1 Formerly Tamil Nadu Power Transmission Improvement Project. \n ", "2 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) will finance transaction \nTA of $650,000 attached to the main project. The proposed TA will finance output 3 of the main \nproject. The objectives of the proposed transaction TA are to (i) enhance TANTRANSCO\u2019s \nfinancial management capacity; (ii) implement the FRP; (iii) facilitate gender-sensitive workplace \npractices, and (iv) enhance the capacity of TANTRANSCO to monitor the environmental and \nsocial impacts of transmission line projects.   \n \n5.  It is proposed that TA resources, rather than a loan, finance these activities as these \nactivities do not contribute positive financial returns. TANTRANSCO is a regulated entity, which \nmeans that a regulator must approve its expenditures and borrowing plans. The regulator would \nbe unlikely to allow the financing of capacity building activities through borrowings.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Implementation of financial restructuring plan and financial management \naction plan supported. The consultants contracted for this purpose will assist TANTRANSCO in \nimplementing the FRP and in particular confirming the intercompany adjustments to be made in \nconsultation with tax authorities, external auditors, and the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory \nCommission. In addition, this output will support implementation of key aspects of the financial \nmanagement action plan.   \n \n \n7.  Output 2: Gender-sensitive workplace practices promoted. This output will support \nTANTRANSCO to undertake a needs assessment to identify interventions to make the executing \nagency (TANTRANSCO) a more gender-sensitive workplace, and support implementation and \nmonitoring of some of these measures. The consultant contracted for this component will, upon \nagreeing with TANTRANSCO on the key interventions, monitor their implementation.  \n \n8.  Output 3: Capacity of Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited to monitor \nenvironmental and social impacts enhanced.  The consultants contracted for this component \nwill  prepare  a  monitoring  framework  for  all  transmission  line  projects  undertaken  by \nTANTRANSCO and will prepare semiannual safeguard monitoring reports for ADB-financed \ntransmission lines.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 of which $650,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 1. \n \n10.  TANTRANSCO will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and other \nin-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will administer the TA and will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants, and \nprocure goods. \n \n ", "3 \n12.  TANTRANSCO will be the executing agency and implementing agency of the TA. The TA \nwill be implemented over a 24-month period commencing in December 2019 and ending in \nNovember 2021.  \n \n13.
