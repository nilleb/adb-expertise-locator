THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Macroeconomic  context.  Sri  Lanka  is  at  a  pivotal  economic  and  demographic \ncrossroads. In 2018, it crossed the threshold into an upper-middle-income country (UMIC) with a \nper capita income of $4,060.1 The new government aims to transform itself into a globally \ncompetitive and inclusive knowledge economy to sustain and further enhance economic growth. \nThe main pillars include prioritizing human capital development, strengthening industry and \nservice sectors, transforming  agriculture, and infusing new technology to enhance productivity.2 \nAgeing population and increasing dependency ratio in Sri Lanka threaten to strain economic \nresources.3 Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness will depend on optimizing its workforce potential. This \nentails improving health and education of its youth to lift productivity and participation rates, \nclosing the gender gap in the labor market, and reallocating labor across sectors. Building a \nhealthy, diversified, and agile workforce \u2014 receptive to lifelong learning, able to adapt, innovate, \nand leverage new technologies \u2014 is key to the government\u2019s development goal.  Thus, the new \ngovernment has prioritized integrated and transformative reforms in the education and health \nsectors to boost human capital development. \n \n2.  Education sector performance. Sri Lanka has made commendable gains in basic \neducation  since  the  1970s.  It  has  achieved  near-universal  primary  enrollment  (99%),  high \nsecondary enrollment (87%), gender parity in access to all levels of education, and a high adult \nliteracy rate (93%). Despite these achievements, Sri Lanka lacks the technical and vocational \nskills  increasingly  demanded  in  industrial  and  service  sectors. 4  Poor  learning  outcome, \ninadequate foundation for twenty first skills and low relevance of education to the labor market \nare  key  challenges.  These  issues  are  exacerbated  by  a  fragmented  education  and  skills \ndevelopment system and the absence of a coordinated and coherent education policy to support \nholistic human capital development.  \n \n3.  While overall access to basic education is high, limited participation in science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, low learning outcomes, and inadequacies in the \nquality and relevance are key challenges in secondary education. This situation is compounded \nby (i) limited opportunities for tertiary education, and (ii) inadequate pathways from secondary \neducation to skills training and higher education. Student participation in tertiary education and \npost-secondary non-tertiary education (including skills training) measured by gross enrollment \nratio (GER) were 19.6% (2018, 23.4% female) and 3.0% (2017, 2.6% female). In contrast, the \ntertiary GER average for UMICs was 58.1% in 2018.5 This leaves a large number of young people \nentering the job market without substantial employment skills. In sum, gains in basic education \nare not translating into comparable outcomes at the post-secondary level. While Sri Lanka has \nlaid a good foundation for skills development with a dedicated ministry, a regulatory body and the \ndelivery of TVET at different levels by various agencies, several challenges remain. These include: \n(i) poor alignment with the private sector; (ii) shortage of qualified instructors with industry \nexperience; (iii) outdated training programs and facilities; (iv) weak quality assurance mechanisms; \nand (v) limited institutional capacities.  \n \n \n1  World Bank.

Higher education plays an instrumental role in producing a future-ready workforce, but the \ngovernment\u2019s capacity to expand state university admissions, especially, in STEM subjects, is \nlimited by constraints in funds, infrastructure, and trained academic staff. Unless higher education \nis realigned with evolving private sector needs, labor market outcomes will continue to be \nadverse.6 The  government\u2019s  aim  to  improve  the  access,  quality,  and  relevance  of  higher \neducation programs will require (i) establishing new degree programs and short courses in priority \nSTEM programs; (ii) enabling the legal framework to promote private sector accreditation and \nprovision;  (iii)  addressing  staff  shortage  and  professional  development  in  STEM;  (iv) \nbenchmarking quality against international standards; and (v) public\u2013private partnerships with \nindustries to stimulate research and development.  \n \n5.  Health sector performance. Sri Lanka has made impressive gains in ensuring access to \nquality health services for all. Life expectancy at birth increased from 70 years in 1990 to 75 years \nin 2015. Maternal mortality reduced from 75.0 to 30.0 per 100,000 live births, and infant mortality \nfrom 17.9 to 8.0 per 1,000 live births over the same period. Despite these improvements, Sri \nLanka faces new health challenges related to population ageing, changing disease patterns, and \nchanging lifestyles. These dynamics have resulted in the rise of noncommunicable diseases while \nre-emerging  and  emerging  communicable  diseases  remain  a  threat.  Health  disparities  are \nsignificant,  with  lagging  regions  and  vulnerable  population  pockets.  The  government  has \nintroduced policy reform in 2018 to address the health challenges for a more responsive, people-\ncentered health care system that is evidence-based, delivers a comprehensive package of \nservices, and can provide continuity of care with adequate financial risk protection for the users.7 \n \n6.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \na long-term partner in education sector development in Sri Lanka, covering school education, \nskills development, and higher education. In the education sector, ADB currently supports the (i) \nSkills Sector Enhancement Program to ensure equitable access to high-quality and relevant \ndemand-driven skills training; and (ii) Science and Technology Human Resource Development \nProject to nurture technology-oriented graduates equipped with market-relevant skills and an \nentrepreneurial spirit. With the approval of Health System Enhancement Project in 2018, ADB re-\nengaged in the sector after 20 years and currently supports the government\u2019s policy reform to \nreorganize health care delivery towards an equity-based, more responsive, and comprehensive \nprimary health care system, in particular, in rural areas and lagging regions. New support has \nbeen proposed to ADB, namely the (i) Secondary Education Sector Improvement Program to \nenhance the quality and relevance of STEM subjects along with 21st century skills at the senior \nsecondary level, essential for preparing Sri Lankan graduates for a knowledge economy; and (ii) \nproposed Innovation Capacity Development in Higher Education Project. \n \n7.  The government appreciated the design and implementation of ADB\u2019s prior technical \nassistance (TA),8 which provided strategic technical inputs through resource persons and expert \n \n6  Disciplines offered are skewed towards arts and management, and less than 20.0% of graduates are from science \nand technology subjects. Female enrollment is mostly concentrated in liberal arts (82.4%), where unemployment is \nthe highest. In addition, university graduates fail to meet the requirements of employers in communication, \ninformation and communication technology (ICT), and soft skills. \n7  Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Health, Nutrition, and Indigenous Medicine. 2018.

The  TA  is  near  completion.  The \ngovernment has requested similar support.  Two key lessons emanated from the previous TA \nimplementation. First, it is important to enhance the capacity of executing and implementing \nagencies in ensuring quality project design, effective project implementation, and overall portfolio \nperformance. ADB support can add value in terms of sharing lessons across projects, introducing \ninnovative approaches, strategic planning, and implementation support in selected areas. Second, \nADB is in a strategic position to provide integrated and coordinated technical inputs across the \nthree subsectors in education (secondary, TVET, and higher education) and health. Working \nacross these three subsectors and with the health system, ADB can promote synergy, effective \nimplementation, expanded private sector participation, and enhanced relevance and quality of \neducation and health services, all of which will lead to the outcome of a stronger and healthy \nworkforce to support national economic goals.  \n \n8.  Rationale for a transaction technical assistance facility. The proposed transaction TA \nfacility will support project preparation, capacity building, due diligence, and improved readiness \nfor pipeline projects that are included in the country operations business plan (COBP),9 as agreed \nwith the government during the TA facility\u2019s timeframe. It will also support the implementation of \nongoing projects.10 The TA facility is aligned with (i) ADB\u2019s strategy 2030;11 (ii) the government\u2019s \nEducation Sector Development Plan, 2018\u20132025;12 (iii) Sri Lanka National Health Policy 2016\u2013\n2025;13 and (iv) Sustainable Development Goal 5.14 The TA facility will support strategic policy \nadvisory and technical inputs on a range of health and education issues, strategy development, \nfinancial  management,  engineering  and  procurement,  quality  assurance,  and  evaluation \napproaches, including independent verification of results. It will bridge capability gaps, apply best \npractices, and foster innovative solutions for common challenges in the sector. In particular, the \nTA  will  bring  in  international  expertise  not  available  in-country  in  the  areas  of  curriculum, \npedagogy, public\u2013private partnerships, and healthcare reform. The TA facility is listed in the \nCOBP for Sri Lanka, 2020\u20132022, with the title Support for Human Capital Development Initiative. \nThe TA facility approach is suitable as it will enhance project preparation efficiency and improve \nproject implementation readiness by (i) allowing the same experts to be mobilized for similar due \ndiligence activities, (ii) facilitating learning on project processing and implementation across \ndifferent projects, (iii) creating synergies from working with common expertise and improving \nknowledge transfer, and (iv) strengthening coordination and synergy among various technical \ninputs and capacity building efforts. Overall, this TA facility will reduce transaction costs compared \nto resources required for separate stand-alone transaction TA projects.  \n \n \nProposed Loans to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka: Science and Technology Human Resource \nDevelopment Project.

Outputs and Activities \n9.  Output  1:  Improved  quality  of  program  and  project  design  in  social  sector \noperations. This output will support the preparation of selected programs and/or projects15 for \npotential ADB financing. The scope of activities will include (i) analytical studies such as sector \nassessments, technical assessments on curriculum, pedagogy, demand assessments involving \ntracer and/or employer surveys, TVET strategy, and stakeholder analysis as appropriate for each \nensuing project; (ii) feasibility studies as required for the ensuing project; (iii) development of \nresults  frameworks  and/or  design  and  monitoring  frameworks;  (iv)  economic  and  financial \nassessments, and social, gender, and poverty analyses; (v) safeguard assessments, including \nenvironment and social safeguards; and (vi) due diligence in financial management, procurement, \nplus other institutional arrangements for executing and implementing agencies. The output will \nalso support projects to achieve project readiness through advance procurement activities, where \nrequired.   \n \n10.  Output 2: Strengthened project management capacity for achieving quality results \nin social sector operations. Technical expertise and capacity building support will be provided \nto selected executing and implementing agencies for the successful implementation of health and \neducation projects. Selective, high-quality inputs will support the achievement of results in \nsecondary education, skills, higher education, and health. At the same time, the TA will support \nquality assurance mechanisms and systems, such as the verification of disbursement-linked \nindicators,  monitoring  and  evaluation  approaches/systems,  financial  management,  and \nprocurement. Having a single TA facility will ensure coordinated and integrated inputs across the \nvarious education subsectors, which will promote the synergy of results.  \n \n11.  Output  3:  Enhanced  capacity  to  develop  and  apply  innovative  practices  and \ntechnology  solutions  for  project  design  and  implementation.  Technical  expertise  and \ncapacity  building  will  support  the  exchange  of  national  and  international  best  practices  in \nsecondary education, skills training, and higher education. The topics will cover: (i) learner \ncentered approaches that build 21st century skills, including critical thinking and problem solving; \n(ii) inquiry-based and investigative pedagogy, including long-term, sustained approach to building \ncapacity of  teachers that will include opportunities to practice new approaches and a focus on \ncoaching  and  ongoing  feedback  mechanism  to  improve  teaching  in  the  classroom;    (iii) \ninformation  and  communication  technology  solutions  for  education  and  health  sectors  (for \nexample, EdTech programs in classroom practices and teacher training); and (iv) cutting-edge \nmonitoring and evaluation approaches or platforms. The output will promote innovative strategies \nto improve learning outcomes and 21st century skills aligned with the modern global economy, \nexpand  post-secondary  pathways,  improve  the  effectiveness  of  pedagogy  and  leadership \nprograms, increase the participation of girls in STEM, and address the low performance and \ndropout of boys. Much of the support will be provided through technical inputs and guidance on-\nthe-job during planning, implementation, and coaching. Some support will be provided through \nseminars, workshops, and national and overseas study visits. This output will also document good \ndesign and implementation of projects to showcase innovative strategies and solutions in the \nhealth and education sectors. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a \n \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA Special Fund (TASF-other sources).The key expenditure items are listed \n \n15  (i) Proposed Secondary Education Sector Improvement Program; (ii) Proposed Innovation Capacity Development in \nHigher Education Project; and (iii) potential new program for skills training. \n ", "5 \nin Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice  space,  office  supplies,  secretarial  and  coordination  assistance,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The executing agency will be the National Planning Department under the Ministry of \nFinance. The implementing agencies are the Ministry of Education; Ministry of Skills Development, \nEmployment and Labour Relations; Ministry of Higher Education, Technology and Innovation; and \nthe Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services. ADB will administer the TA facility. The \nSouth  Asia  Human  and  Social  Development  Division  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate \nconsultants in close coordination with the executing and implementing agencies. The TA facility \nwill be implemented over 3 years, from May 2020 to April 2023.   \n \n14.
