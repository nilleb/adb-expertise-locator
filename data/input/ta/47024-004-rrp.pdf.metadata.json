THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Pehur High Level Canal Extension (PHLCE) Project.1  \n \n2.  The proposed project will develop a new irrigated area of over 8,727 hectares (ha) in \nSwabi and Nowshehra districts located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPP). Water for \nagriculture in the project area currently depends on rainfall. As a result, cropping intensity and \ncrop yields are low. The project will finance the extension of Pehur High Level Canal (PHLC) \nirrigation system, which will become a part of the Indus Basin irrigation system (IBIS). This will \nincrease  agriculture  production  by  increasing  availability  of  water,  improving  water-use \nefficiency and farm management capacity in the project area. The population of the project area \nis about 75,000.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector  overview.  Improved  water  management  and  agricultural  productivity  are \nfundamental to continued economic growth in KPP. Over 37% of people are engaged in the \nagriculture sector, which contributes 18% to provincial gross domestic product.3 Livestock and \nagriculture together provide livelihoods to 83% of the people living in the rural areas.4 While the \ncountry\u2019s poverty level has declined significantly, the proportion of population earning less than \n$2.0 per day was still 51% in 2011.5 The poverty in KPP is more serious than at the national \nlevel. The poverty headcount ratio in KPP was 29% in fiscal year (FY) 2006; 7% higher than the \nnational average. However, the Government of KPP\u2019s own estimate for FY2009 was far higher \nat 39%.6 Food security is a continuous concern in KPP. Of the 24 districts, four districts are \nclassified as in crisis and 10 districts are classified as stressed as of May 2015.7 \n \n4.  To reduce poverty, ensure food security, and for the gross national product to reach its \ntarget of 7%\u20138% annual rate of growth, agriculture sector needs to grow at least 5% per  \nannum.8 The agriculture sector, however, has been performing below its potential. Average \nannual growth rate over the 2003\u20132013 period was 3.3%. \n \n5.  IBIS is the lifeline of Pakistan\u2019s agriculture. Crop water demand in IBIS has increased \ndramatically as a result of higher cropping intensity and cultivation of high water-consuming \ncrops. Key constraints in agriculture in IBIS include insufficient water availability, inefficient use \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa Water Resources Sector Project (TA 8448-PAK). The PHLCE project, which was identified as one of \ncoresubprojects under the TA was unbundled to process as a stand-alone project. \n3  Government of KPP, Bureau of Statistics, Planning & Development Department. 2015.

Official poverty estimates by province have not been released since FY2006. The Ministry of \nFinance estimated the national average poverty at 12.4% in FY2011 in its Economic Survey 2013\u20132014. \n7  World Food Programme. Pakistan Food Security Bulletin in May 2015. Islamabad. The result is based on its \ndeveloped Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. \n8  Ministry  of  National  Food  Security  and  Research.  Agriculture  and  Food  Security Policy.  Islamabad (draft). \nThe Government of KPP also aims to achieve real agricultural growth rate of 5% per year over the next decade \naccording to the Government of KPP\u2019s Comprehensive Development Strategy 2010\u20132017.  \n ", "2 \nof irrigation water, fragmentation of holdings, low crop productivity, post-harvest losses, limited \ninstitutional capacity particularly for extension and research, poor condition of irrigation and \ndrainage systems with deficient operation and maintenance (O&M) mainly due to low cost \nrecovery and limited budgetary allocations. \n \n6.  About 20% of the country\u2019s cultivable land of more than 22.0 million ha is outside IBIS, \nand approximately 3.24 million ha are rain-fed areas.9 The irrigated area in KPP only amounts to \nabout 1.15 million ha of the total cultivable land of 5.73 million ha as of 2013\u20132014. Large part \nof cultivable land is rain-fed, exposing a significant proportion of the rural population to weather-\ninduced risks. Without a secure source of water, farming in rain-fed areas often results in low \nproductivity. \n \n7.  The cropping pattern in the planned project area constitutes wheat and maize coupled \nwith some pulses and oilseeds under rain-fed conditions. The annual effective rainfall is 680 \nmillimeters. The annual cropping intensity of 52% and crop yields (e.g., 1.38 t/ha for wheat, 1.06 \nt/ha for maize, and 1.44 t/ha for oilseeds) are much lower than those in PHLC irrigated area \n(annual cropping intensity of 162%, 2.29 t/ha for wheat, 2.35 t/ha for maize, and 2.0 t/ha for \noilseeds).10 There are a total of 8,630 farms in the project area with an average size of 1.01 ha. \nOver 84% of the farms are less than 2 ha in size and occupy 52% of the cultivable farmland.11 \n \n8.  In KPP, opportunities exist to bring an additional 8.3 million ha of arable land under \nirrigation and improve the water and land productivity by 50%\u2013100%. Construction of small \ndams  and  extension  of  existing  irrigation  systems  in  rain-fed  areas  can  develop  irrigated \nagriculture and increase crop yield.12 \n \n9.  Pehur High Level Canal. The PHLC project started in 1993 with Asian Development \nBank (ADB) financing.13 The project realized the full agricultural potential of about 40,300 ha by \n(i) doubling irrigation supplies to about 35,800 ha; (ii) reclaiming about 8,000 ha of waterlogged \nland; and (iii) developing irrigation in about 4,310 ha of mainly rain-fed land. Water allocation for \na potential extension of the irrigation system for the future was planned at the design stage of \nthe project. The project was successfully completed in 2003.14  \n \n10.  Climate change impacts. The climate change projections for KPP show that there is \nlikely to be an average increase in precipitation of about 5% to 10%. Similarly, temperatures are \nalso expected to rise by about 3oC on average up to the year 2050. Monsoon rainfall is likely to \nincrease, while in other months (e.g., April\u2013May) rainfall is likely to be less and temperatures will \nbe higher. These changes will adversely affect the rain-fed agriculture. In 10 years, kharif \nseason irrigation supplies could increase as climate change melts glaciers of the upper Indus \nRiver basin.15 However, after approximately 50 years, although it will be beyond the lifespan of \n                                                 \n9  Government of Pakistan, Bureau of Statistics. 2013.

The average \nwater withdrawals by KPP from 1999 to 2013 was 6.8 billion cubic meters (m3), which is 0.23 billion m3 less than \nthe allocation. \n13 ADB. 1993.

Project Completion Report: Pehur High Level Canal Project in Pakistan. Manila. The project was rated \nrelevant, efficacious, efficient, and less likely sustainable despite delays of project completion and reduced \neconomic returns mainly because of delays in achieving full agricultural development. \n15 Kharif is the summer crop-growing season from about April to September. Rabi is the winter crop-growing season \nfrom about October to March. \n ", "3 \nthe investment assets of the proposed project, shortages will become more severe as the \nglaciers are depleted and higher temperatures result in increased evaporation from the storage \nreservoirs and due to significantly higher crop water requirements.16  \n \n11.  The proposed project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Pakistan, \n2015\u20132019, which prioritizes the promotion of better water resource management and irrigation \nto improve agricultural productivity, increase farm incomes, and ensure food security.17 The \nproposed project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Pakistan, 2016\u2013\n2018.18 The  KPP\u2019s  Comprehensive  Development  Strategy  (CDS),  2010\u20132017  targets  new \ncultivable  land  of  70,000  ha  to  meet  the  food  demand  of  KPP\u2019s  growing  population  and \nsuggests  various  measures  in  both  water-supply  and  water-use  to  address  issues  in  the \nagriculture sector.19 \n \n12.  The  poor  security  situation  in  KPP  is  a  serious  problem  and  risk  for  project \nimplementation.  One  of  ADB-financed  projects  in  KPP  faced  unusually  harsh  security \nproblems.20 Security concerns of this project have been addressed during its preparation. About \n96% of the project areas are located in the Swabi district which has a lower security risk.21  \n \n13.  The proposed project reflects the lessons learned from the PHLC project: (i) insufficient \nconsultant inputs hampered smooth project implementation; and (ii) complicated implementation \narrangements caused delays in the delivery of project physical outputs and resulted in major \ngaps in ownership and operations of the project causing unnecessary cost overruns and further \ndelays at loan closing. \n \n14.  Irrigation water in the PHLCE system will be released from the existing Gandaf Tunnel at \nTarbela Dam. It will then be carried to farmlands through two pressure pipelines, leading to two \nmain canals, distributary canals, minors, and watercourses.  \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n15.  The project impacts, which are aligned with CDS (footnote 19) will be the following: (i) \nincreased irrigated area, and (ii) ensured food security for 2010\u20132020. The outcome will be \nincreased agricultural production in the project areas. \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  Output 1: Available agricultural water in project areas increased. This includes the \nfollowing components: (i) construction of the irrigation system in the Janda Boka\u2013Malikabad \narea (JBMA), (ii) construction of the irrigation system in the Indus Ambar area (IAA), and (iii) \ndevelopments of efficient monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system and sustainable PHLCE \nO&M plan and its guidelines.  \n                                                 \n16 Climate  Change  Risk  Vulnerability  and  Adaptation  Assessment  Report  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2015.

It reports that project offices were blasted; staff members were killed, injured, and kidnapped; \nand project vehicles and resources were looted. \n21 As of October 2015, nine districts were rated very high or high security risk areas according to the United Nations \nTravel Modality. Swabi is not one of them. \n \n ", "4 \n \n17.  The first component will supply gravity irrigation water to 1,316 ha in JBMA, and the \nsecond to 7,411 ha in IAA, to transform those areas from rain-fed to irrigated agriculture. These \ncomprise (i) connection with the existing Gandaf Tunnel at Tarbela Dam by constructing two \noutlets  (one  for  JBMA  and  another  for  IAA);  (ii)  construction  of  two  pressure  pipelines  \n(approximately 4 kilometers [km] for JBMA and 24 km for IAA) and associated structures; (iii) \nconstruction of two main canals (approximately 11 km for JBMA and 27 km for IAA) with \nassociated structures (e.g., outlets, syphons, drainage crossings, aqueducts, drainage culverts, \nsuper passages,22 and bridges); and (iv) construction of one minor and 20 outlets for JBMA,23 \nand one distributary, seven minors, and 87 outlets for IAA. \n \n18.  The  PHLCE\u2019s  estimated  overall  irrigation  efficiency  will  be  about  65%  with  a  field \nefficiency of about 75%. The capacity of IAA canals will ensure flexibility to extend the irrigated \narea of around 1,400 ha in the future, and sufficient canal capacity has been confirmed against \nthe  climate  change  risks  anticipated  during  2015\u20132065.  The  design  capacity  of  drainage \nchannels incorporate the risk of the increase in flood events predicted due to climate change. \n \n19.  The  third  component  will  develop  the  M&E  system  using  satellite  remote  sensing \ntechnology to assess irrigation efficiency.24 The staff of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Irrigation \nDepartment (KPID) and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Agriculture Department (KPAD) will be trained \nto use the system. The system will also help KPAD assess crop-growing, and KPID assess \nwater productivity and abiana with expected collection from farmers more than the average rate \nof 50%\u201360% in KPP.25 A guideline and sustainable plan of PHLCE O&M with KPP\u2019s committed \nbudget allocation (para.41) will also be developed. \n \n20.  Output  2:  Water-use  skill  and  farm  management  capacity  improved  in  project \nareas.  This output will further improve agricultural benefits resulting from output 1 and (i) \nconstruct watercourses, (ii) form and build capacity of water users\u2019 associations (WUAs), and \n(iii) train farmers for more profitable farming systems and efficient water use skills through \ndemonstration activities and farmer field schools (FFSs). \n \n21.  The first component will construct around 106 watercourses (20 in JBMA and 86 in IAA) \nin  cooperation  with  beneficiaries  who  will  provide  land  and  unskilled  labor.  The  second \ncomponent will form and train one WUA for each watercourse. A manual will be developed to \noutline WUA formation and functions, and efficient watercourse O&M. \n \n22.  The  third  component  will  demonstrate  high-efficiency  irrigation  system  and  more \nprofitable irrigated farming system. In the first year of its activity, 50 plots will demonstrate more \nprofitable farming system. In the second year, another 50 plots will demonstrate efficient water \nuse skills, such as (i) improved field channel layout and operation at the watercourse level, (ii) \npractices for improved water application efficiency (e.g., drip irrigation, and laser land levelling), \n(iii) scheduling irrigation according to crop water requirements, and (iv) other management \ntechniques to optimize water productivity. FFSs will replicate the showcase activities developed \nin these plots by inviting 2,500 farm households. The potential application of high-efficiency \n                                                 \n22 Supper passage is hydraulic structure in which the drainage is passing over the irrigation canal. \n23 Minor is the tertiary canal connecting watercourse.  \n24 The M&E system will be pilot-tested in the Pehur High Level Canal system under the project. \n25 Abiana is the irrigation service fee and its assessment is based on expected crop production. The CDS reported \nthe average collection rate and a total KPP abiana-assessment value of PRs340 million in 2007\u20132008. Collected \nabiana are to be transferred to the Revenue Department of KPP and all collected revenues from various sectors \nare redistributed to required expenditures, including O&M budget allocation for KPP irrigation systems. \n ", "5 \nirrigation systems in some areas with sandy loamy soil will be studied to address potential low \nwater retention capacity in these areas. \n \nD.

The  Government  of  Pakistan  has  requested  a  loan  of  $86.405  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, a custom-tailored repayment method, an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions as set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 15.97 years \nand the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. \n25.  The government will contribute $8.992 million for taxes and duties in the form of cash \nand $1.206 million for part of the land acquisition and resettlement costs. The beneficiaries will \nprovide in-kind contribution equivalent to $0.353 million by providing unskilled labor for the \nconstruction  of  watercourses  and  for  developing  and  operating  demonstration  plots.  The \nfinancing plan is in Table 2 and further detailed in the project administration manual (PAM).26 \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%)\nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (loan)  86.405  89.44 \nGovernment  10.198  10.56 \n    Total  96.603 100.00\nNote: In addition, farmers\u2019 contribution is estimated at $0.353 million. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n                                                 \n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  KPID will be the executing agency. It will establish the project management office (PMO) \nfor project implementation. PMO will have direct responsibility for output 1 under the guidance of \nthe  project  coordinator.  KPAD  will  establish  the  project  implementation  office  that  will  be \nresponsible for implementing output 2 under PMO\u2019s supervision. Since 2006, KPID has had no \nexperience of implementing a project financed by multilateral financing institutions. Therefore, \nADB on behalf of KPID will select the project implementation consultant (PIC) to support PMO \nwith its expected mobilization in the first quarter 2017.27 All funds will be channeled through \nPMO. A project steering committee will further assist timely implementation. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements\nImplementation period  January 2017\u2013December 2022\nEstimated completion date  December 2022 (physical completion) (loan closing date of June 2023)\nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project Steering Committee: Chair: Additional Chief secretary of the Planning \nand Development Department \nMembers: Secretaries of KPID and KPAD, P&DD officials, member of Board of \nRevenue, project coordinator, project director, one member of district \nadministration, one representative from Swabi district, and team leader of the \nconsultant\n(ii)  Executing agency  KPID \n(iii)  Implementing agency  KPAD \n(iv)  Project management office  21 staff in the Swabi district \n(v)  Project implementation  16 staff in the Swabi district \noffice \nProcurement  ICB (works)  1 contract  $45.45 million \n  NCB  4 contracts  $5.31 million \n  Shopping  Multiple  $0.324 million \nConsulting services  QCBS  18 person-months international  $5.24 million \n796 person-months national \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting will be used and retroactive financing has been requested \nadvance contracting  for the engagement of the project implementation consultant. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time), and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, KPAD = Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Agriculture \nDepartment, KPID = Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Irrigation Department, NCB = national competitive bidding, P&DD = \nPlanning and Development Department, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n27.  The project areas were carefully chosen and the pressure pipelines were appropriately \ndesigned so that irrigation water can be supplied with gravity to minimize O&M requirement. The \nproject was found to be at high risk because of anticipated climate change impacts. The climate \nrisk and vulnerability were assessed based on the climate change risk simulation using the \nresult of global circulation models. Adaptation measures were incorporated into the project \ndesign to reduce the risks resulting from increased flood events.  \n \n                                                 \n27 The KPID has been advised that the KPID retains the responsibility for negotiating and signing the contract with the \nconsultant, issuing the notice to proceed, and supervising the consultant\u2019s services. \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n28.  The project is expected to be economically viable in that the overall calculated economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 16.1% and the economic net present value of the investment is \nPRs1,602 million at a discount rate of 12%. These robust economic results are expected due to \nthe substantial size of the economic benefit stream resulting from the prudent project design \nand high agricultural production potential in the project area.28 \n \n29.  A number of risk variables have been used to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Based on \nthe analysis, the project viability is most sensitive to benefits being delayed by 2 years, by which \nEIRR would fall to 12.8% just marginally above the benchmark of 12%. The level of decrease at \nwhich EIRR would fall below the acceptable 12% level is only 6 years. Therefore, it is essential \nthat the project is implemented as scheduled, and technical and agricultural extension support is \nprovided to project beneficiaries to ensure project benefits are realized on schedule. It is also \nimportant to stress that system O&M needs to be carried out appropriately to ensure that the \nbenefits can materialize as estimated. \n \n30.  According  to  CDS,  the  minimum  maintenance  requirements  of  the  KPP  irrigation \nsystems ranged between PRs600 million and PRs900 million per year from 2003/04 to 2008/09 \nwhile the budget allocation in the same period ranged between PRs160 million and PRs300 \nmillion  only.  During  financial  sustainability  assessment  in  2016,  annual  PHLCE  O&M \nrequirement was estimated at $630,000 (PRs66 million). The Government of KPP has assured \nto allocate adequate resources to fully implement O&M plan to be developed under output 1 \nafter completion of physical works. During the development of O&M plan, adequacy of O&M \nrequirement will be reassessed and reconfirmed.29 \n \nC.  Governance \n31.  Weaknesses  and  risks  were  identified  in  using  the  country\u2019s  public  financial \nmanagement  system  in  internal  control,  accounting,  procurement  management,  financial \nrecording and reporting, and external scrutiny and audit. While the financial management risk is \nrated medium, it will be mitigated by various measures, including engagement of accountants in \nPMO and provision of training on financial reporting and auditing. While the overall project \nprocurement risk is rated high, it will be moderate to low after the mitigation measures are in \nplace.  KPID\u2019s  insufficient  experience  in  international  competitive  bidding  and  procurement \ncapacity to follow ADB procurement guidelines will remain a challenge. However, only one \ninternational competitive bidding will be required which PMO will manage. The PMO\u2019s project \nmanagement capacity, including procurement and financial management, will be strengthened \nby PIC. In addition, ADB procurement consultant will assist PMO and PIC in timely, efficient and \ntransparent  procurement.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  and  discussed  with  the  government,  KPID,  and  KPAD.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in PAM (footnote 26). \n \n                                                 \n28 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 O&M fund allocation for the original PHLC system was estimated at PRs31 million; however, it was confirmed \nduring project preparation that the O&M of the system was carried out in a reasonable manner despite only PRs8.6 \nmillion being allocated for O&M in 2015. A reasonable O&M was realized with limited funds mainly because the \ncanal design required less O&M and considerably less sediment load along canals, as the source of water is the \nTarbela Dam, compared with other systems where water is drawn from rivers. \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n32.  Classified as general intervention, the project will indirectly contribute towards poverty \nreduction and economic growth for about 75,000 people in the project area. The project will \nlargely  benefit  the  small  and  poor  farmers  (para.  7).  The  PHLCE  construction  will  have \nsignificant  economic  benefits,  with  increased  agricultural  productivity,  farm  incomes,  and \nemployment opportunities. The project will give preference to the engagement of local labor in \nconstruction work through instructions in contracts and bidding documents. To further maximize \nthe benefits, the project will organize local farmers through WUAs and ensure that there is a \nmechanism  in  place  for  equitable  and  efficient  distribution  of  water.  Farmers\u2019  capacity  in \nprofitable farming systems will be improved through demonstration activities and FFSs. \n \n33.  Based on findings of the gender analysis, women have limited scope to participate as \nactive  players  in  the  project.  The  project  is,  therefore,  classified  as  having  some  gender \nelements, which will require gender actions and measures in the project implementation and \ndesign. A gender action plan has been prepared to ensure that (i) women\u2019s concerns are \naddressed  during  the  design  and  construction  of  the  irrigation  canals  through  separate \nconsultations;  (ii)  provisions  are  made  for  the  skills  development  of  women  farmers  in \nagriculture techniques and efficient on-farm practices; and (iii) gender-responsive resettlement, \nland acquisition, and compensation mechanisms are in place to facilitate affected women. \nThese activities will be monitored through the project\u2019s M&E system. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n34.  Environment (category A). The project will draw on available water resources from the \nTarbela  reservoir  and  within  the  existing  water  use  permits  for  PHLC,  and  will  have  an \ninsignificant impact on overall water resource availability in the project area and in the Tarbela \nreservoir. The environmental impacts will be restricted to the construction phase and can be \nmanaged through environmental mitigation measures provided in the environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) and the environmental management plan (EMP). Two rounds of community \nconsultations  were  held  during  the  EIA  process.  To  address  community  concerns  about \nenvironmental impacts, a grievance redress mechanism will be established with community \nfocal persons. Due to the large scale of project activities, and since it is a new irrigation scheme, \nthe project is classified as category A for environment. EIA has been disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 9 March 2016. PMO will have an environment and social unit and one full-time \nenvironment specialist. PIC will have one part-time international, and one full-time national \nenvironment specialist, and provide capacity support to PMO. PMO will ensure that the design \nand construction are carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \nthe applicable environmental laws and regulations of Pakistan, and EIA and its EMP. KPID will \nensure that potential adverse environmental impacts arising from the project are minimized by \nimplementing all the mitigation measures in EMP. Should any change in scope take place, KPID \nwill inform ADB and a due diligence on the environment will be carried out, following ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Any unanticipated environmental impacts will be reviewed and a \ncorrective  action  plan  prepared  by  the  contractor  for  implementation  under  the  PMO\u2019s \nsupervision with PIC\u2019s assistance. \n \n35.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  The project is classified as category A for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  because  approximately  125  households  will  either  be  physically \ndisplaced or lose 10% or more of their productive assets. Approximately, 219 ha of land will be \n ", "9 \nacquired under the project.30 More than 400 households are likely to lose land and/or other \nassets. KPID has endorsed a draft land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) prepared by \nthe project preparatory TA consultants based on a preliminary alignment of the irrigation system \nand  consultations  with  potentially  displaced  households  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The draft LARP was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 20 June 2016. Information \nbrochures on the draft LARP in the local language will be disseminated to potential displaced \npersons. KPID, with support from PIC, will update LARP based on the approved design and \nalignment after proper notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894. \n \n36.  Land acquisition and resettlement activities will be managed and implemented by KPID, \nthrough PMO, in coordination with the Board of Revenue. Given KPID\u2019s limited experience in \nhandling  resettlement  issues  in  externally  financed  projects,  the  PIC\u2019s  social  safeguard \nmanagement team will support PMO in developing and maintaining a land acquisition and \nresettlement database and management information system. The team will also update and \nimplement LARP, including facilitation of possible land swapping and land consolidation. A \nfunctioning grievance redress mechanism will be established. Internal monitoring reports will be \nprepared  by  PMO  and  PIC  on  a  semiannual  basis.  A  qualified  and  experienced  external \nmonitoring agency, acceptable to ADB, will verify these internal monitoring reports, identify \nissues, and recommend corrective measures if needed. All monitoring reports will be disclosed \non the ADB website. ADB will also help KPID and PMO conduct the external monitoring of \nsafeguards compliance by recruiting the individual consultants as necessary.   \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category C).  There are no indigenous peoples in the project area \nas defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. No indigenous communities will be affected \nby the project and, accordingly, no indigenous peoples planning document is required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInternal control for non-salary expenditure is less  Capacity building will be provided to improve internal \neffective, internal audit is not effective, and there is a  control.
