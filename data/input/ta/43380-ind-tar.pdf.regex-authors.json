INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of India, on behalf of the government of Karnataka (GOK) requested \nADB to assist in the area of water resource management, through the provision of a loan for \ninvestment in the water sector and associated grant funding. 1 This technical assistance (TA) is \nthe second step in the process of preparing the possible investment program, following a \nscoping study completed in October 2009. This TA is in line with ADB's current strategy in the \nagriculture and natural resources management sector, that identifies improving water resource \nmanagement  and  capacity  development  as  key  to  improving  agricultural  productivity  and \nensuring sustainable water use as emphasized in the 11th Five Year Plan. It builds on the \nsubstantial  effort  expended  on  background  studies  for  agriculture  and  water  resources \nmanagement over the past 2\u20133 years, including IWRM, and promotes water sector reforms in \naccordance with ADB's Water Policy 2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In India, impediments to the supply of water are increasingly seen as a major threat to \neconomic  growth.  The  availability  of  water  per  capita  is  rapidly  declining.  Water  stress  is \nincreasing with quality deterioration in many river basins. It is estimated that more than 200 \nmillion people now live under water-scarce conditions. Pressure is further mounting with rapidly \ngrowing demand for water for use in agriculture, cities, and industries. At the same time, \naugmenting  supply  with  new  storage  is  becoming  prohibitively  costly.  Poor  people  are \ndisproportionately affected, with less access to water of lower quality. Climate change will \nexacerbate these problems. This crisis is aggravated by inefficient and unsustainable water use. \nIrrigation accounts for 85% of water utilized, 30%\u201340% of this amount from surface water \nsystems. Groundwater is also overexploited for irrigation in semi-arid and arid areas. Domestic \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  faces  similar  problems,  with  large  amounts  of  water \nunaccounted for. This is attributed to the low quality of distribution services and limited user \nparticipation  and  financing.  Through  the  2002  national  water  policy,  the  government  is \npromoting state reforms to improve efficiency and sustainability in water use, following the \nprinciples of IWRM and quality service delivery with user participation. Several states in India \nhave adopted the policy framework, but implementation languishes at a very formative stage \nacross the country.  \n \n3.  Karnataka is one of the most highly water-stressed states in India\u2014leaving aside small \nsteep western ridges that experience abundant rains\u2014and its economy is one of the fastest \ngrowing. Annual utilization of water was estimated at 37.1 billion cubic meters (m3) in 2000 and \nis expected to increase to 52.0 billion m3 by 2025. Meeting this increasing demand is a major \nproblem, as surface water is almost fully utilized in the state. Groundwater is overexploited in at \nleast 10 of 27 districts. The state thus faces severe challenges in expanding access and \nimproving  water-use  efficiency.  Irrigation  accounts  for  94%  of  water  use  in  major  basins, \nwatering 25% of the net sown area of 11.7 million hectares. The efficiency of surface water \nsystems, at 43% of net irrigated area, is low, with over 40% of the command area deprived of \naccess  by  low  service  quality,  efficiency,  and  farmer  participation  in  irrigation  system \nmanagement  and  operation.  Subsidies  for  groundwater-lift  irrigation,  serving  45%  of  net \nirrigated area, encourage overexploitation, drawing down groundwater levels. As for WSS (3% \nof water use), only 84% of the population has access to safe drinking water and only 38% to \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 5 November 2009.  \n2 ADB.2003. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila (adopted 2001). \n ", "  2 \nsanitation. Only 25% of urban local bodies3  can meet the set requirement of 70\u2013135 liters per \ncapita per day, depending on population size; 16% have underground drainage; and 11% have \nelementary sewerage treatment. Most have inadequate supply and low efficiency in distribution. \nIn rural areas, while 65% of villages have systems that can supply the requirement of 55 liters \nper capita per day, up to 40% of village systems under perform because of either summer \ngroundwater depletion (20%), or insufficient maintenance (20%). Other major challenges in the \nsector  include  increasing  industrial  demand  for  water  and  the  need  for  effective  effluent \nmanagement; forestry and land degradation that affect 40% of total area and cause soil erosion, \nreservoir siltation, and rapid rainwater runoff; and effective sharing of increasingly scarce river \nwater with other states. \n \n4.  In 2002 the GOK promulgated its state water policy in line with the national water policy \nand initiated sector reforms and investments towards efficiently and sustainably managing ever \nscarcer resources. In irrigation, participatory irrigation management (PIM) has been introduced \nto improve water-use efficiency and raise farmers\u2019 income, with massive fund provision to \ncomplete unfinished irrigation schemes. Regarding WSS, the state has enhanced efforts to \nexpand access through physical investments and reforms in service delivery including private \nsector participation. Yet irrigation and WSS reform are still at initial stages. Progress has been \nlimited to establishing a legal and policy framework for sound management to regulate water \nuse. Systems are needed to pursue maximum efficiency in water use and allocation within \nresource endowments, while guiding future development programs with basin-level planning. TA \nis needed to help the state assess needs and effectively implement reforms. The agenda \nincludes (i) setting out a holistic roadmap towards improving efficiency and sustainability in \nwater use and management following IWRM and sound service delivery principles; (ii) defining \nappropriate  bases  for  setting  up  and  operating  institutions  and  arrangements  for  water \nresources management; (iii) progressively developing a decision support system to manage \nwater allocations within basin resource endowments; (iv) undertaking basin planning to develop \nand manage finite water resources optimally; and (v) assessing strategies and programs for \nenhancing water-use efficiency in irrigation and WSS.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The  TA  aims  to  contribute  in  the  longer  term  to  economic  growth,  livelihood \nenhancement, poverty reduction, improved environment, and public health in water-scarce river \nbasins through efficient, effective, and sustainable water resources management. The impacts \nwill be more sustainable water and environmental management in the state, which will (i) \nenhance access to irrigation, WSS, and water supplies for industrial and other water uses; (ii) \nimprove water-use efficiency; and (iii) improve environmental conditions in river basins.     \n \n6.  As the TA outcome, the state is expected to define and adopt an appropriate and \neffective system of water resources management that follows IWRM principles that are suitably \nadapted to Indian conditions and can support the efficient and sustainable use of finite water \nresources through allocation, pricing, and other regulatory and promotional means, including \ndeveloping waterworks. Clear and robust institutional arrangements for the state and the river \nbasins it occupies and shares will be put in place with the assistance of the proposed loan \n                                                 \n3 ULBs in India are the constitutionally provided administrative units that provide basic infrastructure and \nservices in cities and towns \n ", "  3\nprogram. Sub-basin level planning will be put into operation following the model framework plan \nprepared under the TA with stakeholder participation to enhance access, improve efficiency in \nwater  use  and  allocation,  and  protect  the  environment.  The  state  will  acquire  advanced \nknowledge  of  appropriate  options  for  enhancing  water-use  efficiency  and  ensuring  the \nsustainability of WSS and irrigation, including infrastructure, software system improvement, \nmanagement reform, and economic and other incentives based on international best practices. \nThe  capacity  of  counterpart  staff  assigned  to  work  with  the  TA  team  and  on  stakeholder \nawareness will be strengthened in the process. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  IWRM road map, institutional systems, and strategic framework. The TA will provide \ntechnical, institutional, and other expertise to identify and plan the establishment of effective \nIWRM systems in Karnataka. The TA will support preparing key components of state IWRM \nsystems and a work plan for bringing them into operation by:  \n \n(i)  developing an initial IWRM road map in light of state policy and plan documents; \n(ii)  assessing requisite functions and effective institutional arrangements for IWRM \nand sectoral coordination;  \n(iii)  preparing proposals for appropriate institutions such as a water sector apex body \nfor policy and strategic guidance and a regulatory agency to address such issues \nas allocating water, fixing  tariffs, and other regulatory functions for water use for \nirrigation,  WSS,  industry  and  hydropower,  as  well  as  to  ensure  the  quality, \nquantity,  and  timing  of  water  flows  required  for  environmental  functions  and \nmaintaining the resilience of aquatic ecosystems that provide goods and services \nto people; and  \n(iv)  identifying  appropriate  integrated  strategies  for  water  use  and  environmental \nprotection,  identifying  and  quantifying  sector  responsibilities  based  on  the \noutcome of joint sub-basin planning by line departments, a water regulator, and \nthe stakeholder committees required for implementing IWRM. \n \n8.  Sub-basin  framework  plans  for  efficient  and  sustainable  water  resources \nmanagement. The TA will support planning in a selected water-scarce sub-basin of the state, \npossibly the Krishna. The sub-basin4 framework plan will be developed to include surface water, \ngroundwater, and related agendas such as irrigation, WSS, other water uses, the environment, \nand  watershed  issues.  It  will  set  out  broad  strategies  to  meet  rising  water  demand  and \nenvironmental  requirements  with  the  finite  resource  endowments  of  the  sub-basin,  which \ninclude water allocated under tribunal agreements. An institutional setup will be recommended \nthat promotes interagency coordination and stakeholder participation and will provide the basis \nfor forming a river basin organization to manage water resources and coordinate development \nplanning,  should  this  be  deemed  appropriate.  Data  management  systems  and  river  basin \nmodels will be assessed where they exist as to their utility in providing support to water resource \nplanning and management, and recommendations will be made for improving them. A basic \ngeographic information system (GIS) will be developed to collate a range of spatial data that can \nbe used for IWRM planning in the selected sub-basin and possibly for the state. \n \n9.  Efficient and sustainable development and service delivery for urban water supply \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nand  sanitation.  The  TA  will  assess  the  current  situation  with  respect  to  urban  WSS  in \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n4 River basin denotes the entire catchment area of the river basin: sub-basins form part of the basin and for the CDTA \nwould be located within one state. \n ", "  4 \nKarnataka and prepare strategies and guidelines for enhancing water-use efficiency and the \nsustainability of urban WSS, as well as for establishing a program for one or more selected \nareas to be determined in consultation with the government agencies. The TA will build on other \nstudies and projects to improve delivery efficiency, provide accountability, and ensure cost \nrecovery for operation and maintenance, exploring such options as water supply using surface \nwater linked with improved reservoir management and such management arrangements as \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP). A long list will be prepared of urban areas with IWRM needs \nappropriate for an ADB-supported program. This will provide the basis for preparing investments \nin urban WSS during the ensuing project preparatory TA. \n \n10.  Performance upgrading of major irrigation schemes. A sound knowledge base will \nbe established on appropriate structural and other options for improving water-use efficiency \nthrough a more integrated approach to command area management in pilot irrigation system(s), \nto be selected in consultation with government agencies that may be replicated elsewhere \nduring  the  loan  project.  Institutional  assessments  will  be  made  regarding  appropriate \nmanagement arrangements to attain and sustain efficient irrigation across the full command \narea with progressive productivity improvements. The areas to be investigated will include \n(without limitation) (i) enhanced system operation, including rostering water deliveries to better \nreflect user demands and more effective operation of regulation structures to achieve efficient \ndelivery;  (ii)  structural  improvements  to  the  distribution  network  to  increase  water-delivery \nefficiency, such as canal lining and piping; (iii) capacity building for key farmer representatives \nand strengthening existing PIM arrangements; (iv) improved agricultural practices such as the \nuse of systems of rice intensification and cultivation of higher-value and/or more water-efficient \ncrops; and (v) opportunities for PPP to improve the management of distribution systems with, \ne.g., an autonomous irrigation entity financed by water charges collected from farmers, working \nin collaboration with farmer cooperative societies or other water-users\u2019 organizations.  \n \n11.  Through each of the components described above, the TA will strengthen staff capacity \nfor IWRM principles and practices, and application in Karnataka sub-basins using the design \nsupport system and management tools to pursue efficient, sustainable water management. A \nstudy tour to observe day-to-day operations in an advanced river basin in the region will be \nprovided. Stakeholder awareness will be promoted through seminars and media briefings in the \nselected sub-basin, urban area, and irrigation system.  \n \n12.  Water  resources  planning  with  IWRM  is  reasonably  well  supported  in  Karnataka. \nHowever, the TA will require the intensive use of hydrological data and related information, \naccess to which is limited as certain data are classified as secret. The timely provision of data \nand their use in the planning process will be essential to the success of the TA. Data-related \nactivities will need to be coordinated with other projects, in particular the World Bank-funded \nHydrology Project 2.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000 equivalent. The government has requested ADB \nto finance $700,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's Technical \nAssistance Special Fund \u2013TASF other sources. The Government will finance the balance of the \ncost, equivalent to $150,000 (see Appendix 2 for details of the cost estimates and financing \nplan).  \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Water Resources Department (WRD) of the GOK will be the executing agency, and \nthe TA will be implemented through the Water Resources Development Organization (WRDO) \nunder the secretary of the WRD. The Urban Development Department will participate in WSS \naspects, and WRD's irrigation wing will cover irrigation aspects. The WRD secretary will be the \nexecutive TA director, with day-to-day activities managed by the chief engineer of WRDO as TA \nmanager. The GOK will form (i) a TA steering committee chaired by the chief secretary and \nincluding  the  heads  of  relevant  departments,  with  the  WRD  secretary  serving  as  member \nsecretary; (ii) an advisory group of recognized local experts; and (iii) a TA working group \nincluding representatives of relevant departments headed by the WRD secretary and chief \nsecretary.  A  central  advisory  group  may  be  formed  and  chaired  by  the  Central  Water \nCommission.   \n \n15.  The TA will be undertaken over 6 months tentatively set for March\u2013August 2010 by a \nteam  of  (16)  consultants  engaged  through  an  international  firm  associated  with  national \nconsultants. ADB will recruit the consulting firm using quality- and cost-based selection at a ratio \nof 80:20 and simplified technical proposals. The TA will require a total of 48 person-months of \nconsultancy, 12 person-months international and 36 person-months national. The team will \npossess expertise in areas including but not limited to water resources management, hydrology, \nhydro-geology, sub-basin planning, GIS, WSS, and irrigation design. The consultancy and any \nprocurement  to  be  done  will  occur  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix \n3. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.5. \n \n16.  The India Resident Mission (INRM) will monitor TA implementation in coordination with \nthe Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Social Services Division (SANS) through joint review \nmissions and regular interaction with the WRD, GOK, and central government bodies. The GOK \nwill provide counterpart staff, the necessary hydrological and other data, surveys for additional \ndata collection and preparing investment proposals, and basic design under the guidance of the \nTA.  GOK and ADB will monitor progress towards achieving TA outcomes and outputs on the \nbasis of the consultants' inception report for work planning and schedules, bi-monthly progress \nbriefs, and midterm progress report, addressing progress, issues, and recommendations for \nintended outputs. The GOK will monitor progress and quality through regular steering committee \nmeetings, working group meetings and interaction with TA consultants. ADB will monitor and \nreview TA progress and interim and draft outputs through inception and review missions, with \nkey  missions  such  as  inception,  midterm,  and  draft  final  review.  Support  from  the  Urban \nDevelopment Division will be sought for planning and implementing WSS items.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.

The principal objectives of the technical assistance (TA) for Integrated Water Resources \nManagement and Sustainable Water Service Delivery in Karnataka are to \n(i)  help the government of Karnataka (GOK) define and adopt an appropriate and \neffective  system  of  water  resources  management  following  integrated  water \nresources management (IWRM) principles that are suitably adapted to Indian \nconditions  and  can  support  the  efficient  and  sustainable  use  of  finite  water \nresources  through  allocation,  pricing,  and  other  regulatory  and  development \nmeans, including investments in infrastructure, some of which may be funded \nunder an ADB loan; \n(ii)  advance the knowledge of key stakeholders on appropriate options for enhancing \nwater-use efficiency and the sustainability of water supply and sanitation (WSS) \nand  irrigation,  including  infrastructure  and  software-system  improvement, \nmanagement reforms, and economic and other incentives based on international \nbest practices; \n(iii)  Strengthen institutional arrangements for managing selected urban centers\u2014and \npossibly  periurban  and  proposed  new  centers  for  urban  development\u2014and \nmanage one or more selected irrigation schemes, including capacity building for \nkey stakeholders in existing participatory irrigation management mechanisms; \nand \n(iv)  build the capacity of counterpart staff assigned to work with the TA team and \nother key stakeholders involved in water management. \n \nB.  Scope of Work  \n2.  To reach these objectives, the following activities will be undertaken, grouped into five \ncomponents: \n \n3.  Component 1: IWRM Road map, Institutional Systems, and Strategic Framework. \nThis component will provide technical, institutional, and other expertise to identify and plan the \nestablishment of effective IWRM systems in Karnataka. The TA will support the preparation of \nsome key components of state IWRM systems and of a work plan for bringing them into \noperation. The main activities will be to \n(i)  develop an initial IWRM road map in light of existing policy and plan documents, \nas well as consultations to determine the future needs of the state; \n(ii)  assess requisite functions and effective institutional arrangements for IWRM and \nsectoral coordination; \n(iii)  prepare proposals for a water sector apex body and new regulatory agency; \n(iv)  identify appropriate IWRM strategies for water use and environmental protection; \nand \n(v)  prepare  and  implement  a  capacity-building  action  plan  for  IWRM  for  key \ngovernment stakeholders. \n \n4.  Component 2: Sub-basin Framework Plans for Efficient and Sustainable Water \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nResources Management. This component will support planning in a selected water-scarce \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nsub-basin in the state. The sub-basin framework plan will (i) include surface water, groundwater, \nand related agendas such as irrigation, WSS and other water uses, environmental protection, \nand watershed issues; (ii) provide for enhanced institutional arrangements for improved sub-\nbasin  management;  and  (iii)  set  out  broad  strategies  to  meet  rising  water  demand  and \n ", "12      Appendix 3        \n \nenvironmental requirements within the finite resource endowments of the sub-basin, which \ninclude water allocated in tribunal agreements. The main activities will be to \n(i)  identify, with the Water Resources Department (WRD), an appropriate pilot sub-\nbasin for framework planning; \n(ii)  assess data management systems and river basin models where they exist; \n(iii)  develop a basic geographic information system to assemble spatial data for \nplanning; \n(iv)  work with stakeholders at the state and sub-basin level to identify a strategic \nvision and objectives for IWRM; \n(v)  identify institutional enhancements and investment projects to achieve the vision \nand objectives; \n(vi)  assess the need for a river basin organization to plan and manage sub-basin \nwater resources; \n(vii)  prepare a design and a plan for establishing a river basin organization, if deemed \nappropriate; \n(viii)  prepare and implement a capacity-building action plan for sub-basin decision \nmakers and water managers; and \n(ix)  prepare the sub-basin framework plan. \n \n5.  Component 3: Efficient and Sustainable Development Service Delivery for Urban \nWSS. This component will build on other studies and projects to improve delivery efficiency, \nprovider  accountability,  and  the  recovery  of  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  exploring \nalternative  intervention  options  such  as  the  supply  of  surface  water  linked  with  improved \nmanagement of reservoirs and such management arrangements as public\u2013private partnership \n(PPP). The main activities will be to \n(i)  assess the current situation with respect to urban WSS in Karnataka, \n(ii)  prepare broad strategies and guidelines for enhancing water-use efficiency and \nthe sustainability of urban WSS, \n(iii)  work with government agencies to select one or more urban areas for piloting \nfurther study to prepare a long list of urban areas with IWRM needs that would be \nappropriate for future ADB support, \n(iv)  identify  a  range  of  policy  enhancements  and  intervention  options  for  more \neffective provision of WSS services, \n(v)  develop a program of physical investments for the agreed pilot areas, \n(vi)  develop strategies and proposals for improved management of WSS schemes \nincluding PPP options, and  \n(vii)  prepare and implement a capacity-building action plan for selected urban WSS \ndecision makers and managers. \n \n6.
