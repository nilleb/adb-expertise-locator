The long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) sets inclusive growth as one of three key agendas aimed at reducing poverty and \ninequality in Asia and the Pacific and enabling the excluded to contribute to and benefit from \neconomic growth.1 Of the many millions disadvantaged by social and cultural prejudice and \nother circumstances and thus unable to take part in the region\u2019s rapid economic expansion, \nwomen form the largest group by far.2 To end their exclusion, it is essential that women and the \ndisadvantaged become involved in deciding how to manage the public resources that directly \naffect their economic life. Decentralizing government is one way to help make that happen. ADB \nhas recognized the importance of supporting such gender-responsive and inclusive governance \nin its policies on governance (1995) and gender and development (1998) as well as its Gender \nand Development Plan of Action (2008\u20132010). The third of the Millennium Development Goals \non gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment also includes an indicator on the representation \nof women in decision-making positions. \n \n2.  This technical assistance (TA) seeks to identify and support promising practices for \ngreater representation and participation by women in decentralized governance3. Decentralizing \nfiscal responsibility and devolving authority to local government levels opens the way for women \nand  other  disadvantaged  groups  to  engage  in  policy  planning,  budget  decisions,  and \nparticipatory  monitoring.  Challenges  must  be  overcome  if  these  opportunities  are  to  be \nmaximized, however. The TA will be implemented in Cambodia, Indonesia, and Nepal and will \nintegrate  the  lessons  and  recommendations  of  other  related  TAs.  During  TA  fact-finding \nmissions  in  June  2008,  technical  discussions  with  governments  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) at the central, provincial, and district levels confirmed the relevance of the \nTA\u2019s  proposed  activities  and  the  commitment  of  these  governments  to  work  with  ADB  in \nimplementation. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Improving governance, which can be defined as the relationship between the state and \nits citizens, plays a crucial role in reducing poverty and inequality and promoting sustainable \ndevelopment. This is because governance shapes political decisions over the allocation of \npublic  power  and  the  distribution  of  resources.  Good  governance  allows  citizens  to  claim \nentitlements in three broad areas: (i) the right to participate in public decision making, (ii) the \ninclusion of their needs and interests in considering public policy, and (iii) pro-poor budgetary \nallocation of resources. The ability to exercise these rights is, in practice, often determined by \ngender roles and relations of unequal power. \n \n4.  Overall, efforts to expand the role of women in decision making in the Asia and Pacific \nregion have had mixed results. ADB\u2019s report on Pursuing Gender Equality through the MDGs \n(2006) showed that female representation in national parliaments has increased in only about \nhalf of the region\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) over the past decade.5 Nepal led the \nway, with women making up 33% of the Constituent Assembly in 2008. Indonesia, with an \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  For the purpose of this TA, \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d is defined to include the poor and those who face discrimination and/or \nabuse as a result of their gender, ethnicity, caste, religion, or other personal attributes. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 June 2008. \n4   The TA will support activities within the framework provided by the Decentralization and Deconcentration Reform \nProgram (2005) in Cambodia, the decentralization reform program (1999) in Indonesia, and the Local Governance \nand Community Development Program (2008) in Nepal. The TA activities respond to needs identified in ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategies and programs and during the design and implementation of its investment programs. \n5  ADB, UNDP and UNESCAP. 2006. Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia \nand the Pacific. Manila. \n ", "2   \n11.6% representation in 2004, lagged behind the 15% average for Asia. The reasons behind the \nlimited presence of women in positions of formal authority are well understood and reflect the \npower relationships that shape social, political, economic, and cultural life. \n \n5.  Decentralization is often thought to impact women and other disadvantaged groups \npositively because it brings decision closer. Greater opportunities do, in fact, exist for women at \nthe decentralized level, given their key roles in local communities. When it is superimposed on \nexisting systems of political patronage and culture, however, decentralized government can be \njust as discriminatory against the excluded as its centralized predecessor. It will operate along \nthe same fault lines of gender, ethnicity, caste, and class unless mechanisms ensure that \nwomen and disadvantaged groups gain representation. The policy and legal frameworks that \ndefine how decentralization occurs can determine the success or failure of gender-responsive \nlocal  governance.  In  Cambodia,  for  instance,  women\u2019s  representation  in  directly  elected \ncommune councils increased from 8% in 2002 to 15% in 2007. However, a proposal for indirect \nelection  by  commune  councilors  at  the  decentralized  level  under  new  organic  laws  for \ndecentralization  and  deconcentration  (D&D)  approved  in  2008  raises  new  challenges  to \nwomen\u2019s representation. \n \n6.  The effectiveness of affirmative actions is far from guaranteed and still largely unknown. \nIn Indonesia, the adoption of a 30% quota for women\u2019s participation in political parties in 2003 \nhad limited impact on women\u2019s representation at the national and local levels. In Nepal, the \nLocal Self-Governance Act of 1999\u2014and subsequent supporting legislation\u2014has established a \nmandatory minimum of 20% representation by women at the ward level and 30% in users\u2019 \ncommittees but the actual performance and impact has not been properly measured. Such \nassessments are important and need to be undertaken now. The effectiveness of current policy \nframeworks should be studied and the impact of affirmative actions must be evaluated. ADB\u2019s \nDMCs need to identify the gaps between national commitments to gender equality and their \ntranslation  into  actual  gender-responsive  decentralized  governance.  They  can  then  share \npromising practices and identify critical entry points for support. \n \n7.  Women not only lack input in public decision making, their needs and interests are not  \ngenerally well-reflected in sector policies and the allocation of resources, mainly because their \ngendered interests, such as health and family welfare, are not interpreted as a community or \nnational common good. In the three countries participating in the TA, a new tool for linking \ngovernments\u2019 gender commitments to actual resource allocation has emerged in the form of \ngender-responsive budgeting (GRB) initiatives. Government efforts in promoting advocacy for \nGRB, assisted by United Nations agencies, are proving successful. GRB committees have been \nestablished in Cambodia and Nepal and pilot initiatives launched at the decentralized level in \nIndonesia.  The  challenges  are  to  (i)  apply  the  GRB  mechanisms  to  sector  ministries,  (ii) \nfacilitate  greater  advocacy  and  partnership  among  strategic  partners  for  greater  practical \napplication of GRB tools, and (iii) implement pilot initiatives. \n \n8.  Elected women have shown they can use government resources efficiently, improve the \ndelivery of government services, and discourage corruption\u2014but to do so and to gain office they \nfirst need training and support. This makes it urgent that support for women and women\u2019s \nassociations in the three countries participating in the TA be scaled up to help them perform \ntheir roles and responsibilities in local planning processes, budget allocation decisions, and in \nlocal  administrations  and  legislatures.  In  addition,  the  literature  on  decentralization  and \ndevelopment  outcomes  is  virtually  silent  on  the  gender-related  outcomes  of  political, \nadministrative, and financial decentralization, the gender differentiated nature of participation \nopportunities, and gender access to public services and resources. The approaches with the \ngreatest potential for increasing the involvement of women in decentralized governance need to \nbe identified and documented, therefore, and local organizations need to be given the skills and \nresources to employ these methods. \n \n ", "  3\n \n  III.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcomes \n \n9.  The  impact  of  the  regional  TA  is  more  transparent,  gender-equitable,  and  socially \ninclusive governance at the decentralized level in the participating countries. Its outcome is \naccess for DMC officials and ADB staff to lessons and good practices to improve the gender \nresponsiveness of policy, planning, budgeting, and project design. The TA will help disseminate \npractical lessons for use by ADB staff, governments, civil society organizations, and funding \nagencies.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  and  Nepal  through  local \nadministrations  relevant  to  ADB  operations.  Countries  were  selected  based  on  their \ndemonstrated ability and/or commitment to (i) implement national policies and legislation aimed \nat promoting gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment at the decentralized level; (ii) engage \nwith  civil  society  and  women\u2019s  NGOs  involved  in  transformative  approaches  to  gender-\nresponsive planning, budgeting, and participatory monitoring; and (iii) act on the TA findings and \nrecommendations by supporting policy reforms to institutionalize women\u2019s role in decentralized \ngovernance. ADB\u2019s current involvement in policy dialogue and investment in governance reform \nand the potential for scaling up the TA-supported approaches in ADB operations were other key \nselection criteria. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Outputs \n \n10.  Output 1: Actions to Address Inconsistencies and Gaps in Policy, Legal, and \nIntergovernmental  Fiscal  Frameworks  Submitted  to  Relevant  Authorities.  The TA will \nassess the gender-responsiveness of the national policy, legal, and intergovernmental fiscal \nframeworks related to decentralized governance in the participating countries. It will assess the \nextent to which national commitments to gender equality have been translated into sector \npolicies  and  decentralized  government  legislation  and  recommend  actions  to  address \ninconsistencies and gaps. In Cambodia, the TA will assess the gender responsiveness of the \nCommune/sangat laws (2002), the organic laws for D&D of 2008, related royal decrees, sub-\ndecrees,  and  prime  minister\u2019s  orders,  the  national  program  for  D&D,  and  the  second \ngovernance action plan. In Indonesia, it will assess the compliance of provincial and district \nlegislation, processes, and structures with national commitments to gender equality. In Nepal, it \nwill take stock of options for advancing gender equality and social inclusion in federal structures, \nbased  on  lessons  since  the  adoption  of  the  Local  Self-Governance  Act  in  1999.  The \nassessments will not be limited to decentralized formal political and administrative structures but \nwill  include  citizen-  and  community-based  organizations\u2014i.e.,  water  users\u2019  associations, \nfarmers\u2019 associations, and business associations. Their incorporation of gender equality and \nsocial inclusion goals in their organizational governance systems and their compliance with \nmandatory targets or quotas will be evaluated. From a fiscal perspective, the extent to which \nlocal governments can actually influence the allocation of resources in their constituencies will \nbe assessed. \n \n11.  Output 2: Gender-Responsive Budgeting Initiatives in Decentralized Governance \nPiloted. The TA will support GRB initiatives in selected communes in Cambodia and districts in \nIndonesia and Nepal. It will include a gender assessment of selected sector budgets and \nexpenditures  to  establish  whether  decentralized  budgets  have  adopted  and  acted  on  an \nunderstanding of what the core gender issues and priorities are. The analysis will look at \nappropriations  and  actual  expenditures  in  sectors  relevant  to  ADB  operations\u2014agriculture, \neducation,  infrastructure,  and/or  local  governance\u2014and  selected  in  consultation  with  the \nadvisory group at project onset (see para. 17). It will be limited to the current and past 2 fiscal \nyears. It will also include gender budgeting pilot projects at the decentralized level. This will \ninvolve  identifying,  designing,  and  implementing  pilot  projects  on  gender  budgeting\u2014i.e., \n ", "4   \nparticipatory planning and gender budget-tracking\u2014to assess the level of synchronization of \ndevelopment  planning  priorities  among  sectors  at  the  decentralized  level.  The  detailed \nmethodology will be developed by the implementing agency based on an advocacy model \noutlined in Appendix 4.6 \n \n12.  Output 3: Capacity of Selected Women Representatives and Groups to Effectively \nParticipate in Local Government Enhanced. The TA will aim to build the confidence and \ncapacity of women and their representation in local governance processes and structures. It will \nidentify,  design,  and  implement  innovative  initiatives  to  support  women  and  women\u2019s \nassociations,  including  self-help  groups  and  grassroots  networks,  in  selected  Cambodian \ncommunes, Indonesian districts, and village development committees and/or municipalities in \nNepal. It will support (i) female representatives in performing their roles and responsibilities at \nthe local level and reflecting the priority needs of women and other disadvantaged groups in the \nplanning  processes  of  local  government  bodies,  in  budget  allocation  decisions,  in  local \nadministrations and legislatures, and in other resource allocation decisions;7 (ii) women\u2019s self-\nhelp groups and grassroots networks in engaging with local sector agencies that implement \nlocal development programs and in participating in decentralized governance structures  that \nare supported by ADB loans and where women can access loan-related basic social services, \nopportunities, and benefits;8 and (iii) women\u2019s advocacy NGOs that are involved in increasing \nthe interaction of rural women with decentralized governments and line agencies and building \nthe ability of these women to take part in sector policy dialogue and inform legislation. \n \n13.  The TA will be assessed through a rigorous evaluation methodology that will employ \nempirical  tools  to  measure  the  impact  of  the  direct  interventions  through  focus  group \ndiscussions and sample surveys. It will use control groups to allow comparison between the \nareas with direct interventions and those without. The indicators to assess impact will be defined \nduring TA inception and include knowledge, empowerment, confidence, and ability to inform \ndecision making and budgetary allocation processes. The information and understanding drawn \nfrom the direct interventions will yield valuable lessons and best practices for use in the design \nand implementation of ADB loans and interventions by other development partners.  \n \n14.  Output 4: TA Products Endorsed by DMC and ADB and Disseminated. Regional \nconsultations  will  be  organized  at  the  inception  phase  in  Phnom  Penh  to  finalize  the  TA \nmethodology, at midterm in Jakarta to ensure cross-fertilization of experience, and at the final \nphase  in  Kathmandu  to  seek  feedback  from  government  focal  agencies,  civil  society \norganizations, and other development partners on TA outputs and to plan follow-up initiatives. \nThe first consultation will be followed by an inception report, and the second by a midterm report \nthat will include country reports on outputs 1 and 2. At the final consultation, two draft reports \nwill be presented: (i) a technical report, including a comparative analysis, on advancing gender \nequality and social inclusion in decentralized governance; and (ii) a review of ADB\u2019s project \nportfolio, identifying practical modalities and options to ensure a more effective and systematic \nincorporation of gender and governance components in mainstream development programs and \nADB\u2019s  ability  to  deliver  on  its  commitments  to  pro-poor,  gender-responsive,  and  socially \ninclusive governance set out in Strategy 2020. \n                                                 \n6  In most DMCs with decentralized system of governance, local governments are faced with financing gaps and exist \nparallel to central ministry line agencies that control most of fiscal resources and are accountable to their parent \nministries. \n7  The targeted representatives will be elected or appointed female representatives in local governance in Cambodia \nand Indonesia and women members of political parties at the local level in Nepal. \n8  Activities will be implemented as follows: in Cambodia, in two communes in Kompong Thom Province under the \nTonle Sap Lowlands Rural Development Project; in Indonesia, in two districts in Lampung Province (Sumatra), \nunder  the  Participatory  Irrigation  Sector  and  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  projects;  in  Nepal,  two  village \ndevelopment  committees  or  municipalities  where  the  Community-based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation,  the \nCommunity Livestock Development, or the Decentralized Rural Infrastructure and Livelihood projects are being \nimplemented. \n ", "  5\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000.  ADB  will  finance  the \nequivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis from its TA funding program and $500,000 will be \ncofinanced through regional TA 6337 for Development Partnership Program for South Asia, \nfunded under the Australia\u2013ADB South Asia Development Partnership Facility, which has been \ndesigned to provide support and cofinancing by the ADB in the participating DMCs. Regional TA \nhas  already  been  approved  by  the  President;  therefore,  cofinancing  is  not  required  to  be \napproved again under this TA. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, starting in December 2008, with completion \nexpected in December 2010. Consultants\u2019 inputs will amount to: 18 months for international \nexperts, 18 months per country for national research institutes (NRIs), and 18 months per \ncountry for national women\u2019s NGOs. An international organization will be engaged under the \nquality- and cost-based selection method, at a quality/cost ratio of 80:20, to undertake the \nconsulting services, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The consultant team fielded by the international organization will \nbe  composed  of  three  international  experts\u2014team  leader,  gender  budgeting  expert,  and \nresearch coordinator\u2014and subcontracted NRIs and NGOs. The outline terms of reference for \nthe  experts  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  international  organization  will  select  and  subcontract \ndesignated NRIs and NGOs based on the selection criteria set forth in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  ADB will be the TA\u2019s executing agency. ADB\u2019s Gender, Social Development, and Civil \nSociety Division will be responsible for overall administration. Implementation of TA activities will \nbe carried out in consultation with the gender specialists and relevant staff at ADB resident \nmissions and headquarters. An advisory group will provide guidance to the consultant team. It \nwill include representatives from government focal agencies and resident mission-based gender \nspecialists and experts from other development agencies in each of the three participating \ncountries. The focal agencies have been identified based on their involvement in implementing \ngovernment  decentralization  agendas.  They  include:  in  Cambodia,  the  Ministry  of  Interior \n(Department  of  Local  Administration),  the  National  Committee  for  Decentralization  and \nDeconcentration  (NCDD),  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance \n(Gender Mainstreaming Action Group), the technical working groups on D&D and Gender, and \nthe Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs; in Indonesia, the Ministry of Home Affairs (Directorate General \nof Regional Development Planning), the National Development Planning Agency, the Ministry of \nEconomics and Finance and the Ministry of Women\u2019s Empowerment; and in Nepal, the Ministry \nof Local Development, the National Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance (gender-\nresponsive budget committee), and the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare. The \nrepresentatives of the advisory group will play a key role during the three regional consultations \nby assessing (i) TA methodology and activities during the inception meeting in Phnom Penh; (ii) \nprogress in TA implementation during the midterm review meeting in Jakarta; and (iii) TA \nfindings  and  recommendations  during  the  final  meeting  in  Kathmandu,  where  effective \nmodalities to incorporate them into DMC policies, strategies, and programs and the ADB loan \nportfolio  will  also  be  identified.  Regional  consultations  will  be  complemented  by  national \nconsultations at critical stages of TA implementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance, not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Gender-Responsive Decentralized Governance in Asia, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData Sources and/or \nDesign  Performance Targets and/or  Assumptions \nReporting \nSummary  Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact  \u2022  Increased number of women and  \u2022  Government,  Assumptions \nMore transparent,  other disadvantaged groups   development  \u2022  Decentralization \ngender-equitable, and  represented in local governance  partners, and civil  reform momentum \nsocially inclusive  (20% from baseline)  society reports  maintained \ngovernance at  \u2022  Mitigation of gender-discriminatory  \u2022  Decentralization  \u2022  Governments\u2019 \ndecentralized level in the  policies and practices in  policies, laws, and  commitment to \nparticipating countries  decentralized governance  intergovernmental  gender equality and \n\u2022  Incorporation of TA findings and  fiscal frameworks  social inclusion \nrecommendations into future ADB \nassistance \nOutcome  \u2022  DMC officials endorse findings  \u2022  ADB CPSs, loan,  Assumptions \nDMC officials and ADB  and recommendations in TA  and TA documents  \u2022  Sociopolitical \nstaff access lessons and  reports  \u2022  Proceedings from  stability in the \ngood practices to  \u2022  ADB\u2019s CPSs, loan, and TA  regional  participating \nimprove the gender  documents in the participating  consultations   countries \nresponsiveness of policy,  countries acknowledge the need  \u2022  TA final report   \u2022  Working \nplanning, budgeting, and  to promote gender equality and  environment \nproject design  ensure women\u2019s participation in  conducive to \ndecentralized governance  learning \n \nRisk \n\u2022  Local sociopolitical \nfactors may \nconstrain the ability \nof women to \nimplement changed \npractices \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Advocacy Model for Gender Budgeting \n \n5.  Gender-responsive  budgeting  (GRB)  is  usually  considered  to  involve  changing \nfinancial and budgetary policy to facilitate good governance and gender equality principles \nand  objectives  by  ensuring  that  men  and  women  have  equal  access  to  entitlements, \nresources, and services.1 This traditional approach misses what should be a very important \ndimension of GRB, namely a gendered assessment of overall budget allocations and the \ngendered  appropriateness  of  expenditure  priorities  across  and  within  sectors.  For  the \npurpose  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA),  GRB  will  be  defined  to  determine  whether \ndecentralized budgets have adopted and acted on a gendered understanding of what the \ncore  sector  issues  and  priorities  are\u2014for  example  whether  program-based  budget \nsubmissions include adequate gender analysis and identification of actions and resources to \nrespond to critical gender concerns\u2014rather than to assess how gender-responsive sector \nbudgets are, or the benefit incidence analysis approach. \n \n6.  Under  output  2  (Gender-Responsive  Budgeting  Initiatives  in  Decentralized \nGovernance Piloted), the TA will support: (i) gender assessment of selected sector policies, \nbudgets, and expenditures, looking at overall budget allocations in the current and past two \nfiscal years and the appropriateness of expenditure priorities across and within selected \nsectors relevant to ADB operations\u2014i.e. agriculture, education, infrastructure, and/or local \ngovernance; and (ii) gender budgeting pilot projects at the decentralized level in selected \ncommunes (Cambodia) and districts (Indonesia and Nepal). \n \n7.  Table A5.1 below shows an advocacy model for gender budgeting, outlining ideal \nsteps that should be considered in the design and implementation of TA output 2(b), which \nwill have to be further elaborated by the international organization and adapted to country \nspecific  contexts.  The  model  would  have  to  be  revised  for  Cambodia,  in  line with  that \ncountry\u2019s ongoing public financial management reform program, which has only recently \nintroduced program budgets in line ministries, thus creating an opportunity for GRB. \n \nTable A5.1: Steps for Gender-Budget Exercise \n \n  Step I  StepII\n \n \nObjective:  Synergy \n  among  Gender analysis of selected \n   WEqeaunlfadali rtye   Gaonvde NrnGmOesn t  secatonrd p eoxlipceiensd,i tbuuredsg ets  pGilRotBs   Step\n  HCDrIi,t iHcaPl Ir, eGvDieIw,  aonf d  III\n  Step IV  GEM\n \nCategorized data \nM&E of  \n  Gender-based budget allocations \n \n \nGDI = gender development index, GEM = gender empowerment measure, GRB = gender-responsive budgeting, HDI = human \ndevelopment index, HPI = human poverty index, M&E = monitoring and evaluation; and NGO = nongovernment organization. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  This traditional approach to GRB has been supporting the disaggregation of public expenditures as: (i) \nspecifically targeted to women and girls\u2019 expenditures; (ii) general or mainstream expenditures; and (iii) equal \nemployment opportunity expenditures, directly undertaken by the agency on behalf of its women workers.

Ideal steps include: \n \n(i)  creating synergy between government and NGOs through the provision of \ngender  budgeting  advocacy  training  to  selected  government  and  NGO \nrepresentatives [months 1\u20133]; \n(ii)  undertaking  gender  analysis  of  selected  sector  policies,  budgets,  and \nexpenditures by assessing whether decentralized budgets have adopted and \nacted on a gendered understanding of what the core issues and priorities \nare\u2014that is, whether program-based budget submissions include adequate \ngender analysis and identification of actions and resources to respond to \ncritical gender concerns [months 3-9]; \n(iii)  implementing  gender  budgeting  pilots  in  selected  communes  and  districts \nrelevant to ADB operations in the three participating countries (Months 3\u201312, \nCambodia and Indonesia, and months 9\u201318, Nepal); \n(iv)  monitoring and evaluation of gender-based budget allocations through gender \nbudget-tracking and assessment of achievement of gender budget targets. \nKey  findings  of  the  pilot  projects  will  be  submitted  to  the  TA  advisory \ncommittees  with  suggestions  for  policy  reforms  to  institutionalize  gender-\nresponsive and pro-poor budget practices at the decentralized level in the \nthree participating countries (month 18, Cambodia and Indonesia, and month \n24, Nepal). \n \n9.
