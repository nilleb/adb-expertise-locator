INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support Qinghai Province of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in formulating sustainable regional tourism strategies to be \nintegrated into the Belt and Road Initiative\u2019s economic opportunities that would be available within \nthe PRC by capitalizing on the province\u2019s unique character, while preserving its unique ecological \nand cultural assets. \n \n2.  The Government of the PRC has requested the TA from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) as part of its effort to support the lesser-developed northwestern regions of the country to \npromote green and inclusive economic growth.1 Following a mission on 20 October 2018, ADB \nand the executing and implementing agencies for the project reached an understanding on the \nTA  objectives,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  costs,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants.2 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for the \nPRC.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The economic impact of travel and tourism is growing globally. The direct and indirect \ncontribution  of  travel  and  tourism  to  the  PRC\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  in  2017  was \n$1,349.3 billion, or 11% of the total gross domestic product, and this is forecast to grow at 6.6% \nper year by 2028. It was also estimated that about 10.3% of the PRC employment was directly or \nindirectly supported by travel and tourism in 2017, and this is forecast to grow at 3.5% per year \nbetween  2018  and  2028.4 Tourism  contributes  to  economic  growth  and  job  creation,  and \nincreasingly also to environmental protection and cultural preservation through better planning, \nmanagement, and protection of ecology and local culture.5 \n \n4.  Qinghai is on the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau and at the heart of the ancient Silk Road routes, \nalong with other northwestern provinces and regions such as Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and \nXinjiang. It has a land area of about 720,000 square kilometers with an average altitude of more \nthan 3,000 meters. Qinghai is one of the least-densely populated regions in the PRC with about \n6 million inhabitants, of whom 46.9% live in rural areas. About 47.7% of the population belongs \nto more than 50 ethnic minorities, whose origins are often related to cultures outside of Qinghai. \nThe eastern part of the province is on a highland with altitudes ranging from 1,800 to 2,700 meters, \nand about 65% of the Qinghai population is concentrated in Xining City, the provincial capital, and \nHaidong City. The rest is dispersed in the remaining 97% of the area administered by six \nautonomous prefectures. In the northwestern part of the province lies Qaidam Basin, a barren \ndesert with salt lakes and rich oil, coal, and mineral resources. The southern part of the province \nincludes high-altitude grasslands and mountains more than 6,000 meters above sea level. \nQinghai is home to rare and unique wildlife and important wetland, grasslands, and forests. Three \nof Asia\u2019s major rivers originate here: the Mekong River, Yangtze River, and Yellow River. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

In terms of development, Qinghai lags the east-coast regions of the PRC, and the income \ninequality between its urban and rural population is significant.6 Among the major industries such \nas manufacturing, tourism is a potentially growing industry in Qinghai. Because of its unique \ngeographic location, rich culture, and history, Qinghai has diverse natural and cultural assets. The \nprovincial government defined tourism as the key strategic industry to be promoted because \necological protection is the province\u2019s priority. Tourism also provides opportunities for rural \nvillages to highlight their distinctive local cultures. However, tourism development in Qinghai is \nnot mature and investments are not producing quality outcomes because the tourism industry \nlacks (i) value-adding products, (ii) regional cooperation, (iii) skilled human resources, (iv) an \nenabling environment for private tourism businesses, (v) an institutional mechanism, (vi) tourism \npromotion, and (vii) a healthy balance between the supply of tourism products and services and \nthe increasing demand of tourists. \n \n6.  Qinghai\u2019s challenges are that (i) its extensive land area, geographic features, and limited \nconnectivity make it difficult for tourists to visit multiple locations during their stay in Qinghai, and \nalso for scattered tourism spots, cities, and villages to form tourism clusters to enjoy economies \nof scale; (ii) the industrial chain of tourism and associated industries and facilities is not strongly \nformed, and mutual benefits or synergies are not fully utilized; (iii) Qinghai lacks strong pull factors \nfor tourists despite its unique ecological and cultural characteristics and resources; (iv) the \ninstitutional setting for the provinces and regions outside of Qinghai to implement tourism plans \nis weak, making it difficult for Qinghai or other areas along the Silk Road to achieve regional or \ninterprovincial implementation of tourism projects; and (v) Qinghai needs very careful tourism and \nrural development planning and implementation because the preservation of the ecology is the \ntop priority for Qinghai.7  \n \n7.  Since 2016, the Qinghai government has issued policies, directions, and opinions on \naccelerating holistic and strategic tourism development, rural village tourism, poverty alleviation \nand regional cooperation through tourism, which is in line with the national program of creating \ncompetitive  tourist  routes  and  products  with  Silk  Road  features.  Its  Tourism  Development \nThirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020  gives  strategic  guidance  on  how  to  achieve  these \nobjectives.8 In 2018, the Government of the PRC has launched the Strategic Plan for Rural \nVitalization, 2018\u20132022; and Action Plan for Promoting Quality Improvement of Rural Tourism \nDevelopment, 2018\u20132022 that emphasizes the importance of protecting and promoting local and \nrural culture and ecological characteristics in tourism development.9 Therefore, it becomes \nabsolutely essential for Qinghai to conduct a detailed study and formulate a practical action plan \nto implement the plans and policies for sustainable tourism in Qinghai, and for the northwestern \nprovinces and regions in the PRC to coordinate tourism development. \n \n                                                \n6  By economic sector, Qinghai\u2019s gross regional product ratios in 2016 were 8.6 (primary), 48.6 (secondary), and \n42.8 (tertiary). Despite the growth in the secondary economic sector, Qinghai\u2019s per capita gross regional product was \nCNY44,348 in 2017\u2014about one-third that of Beijing or Shanghai. Per capita disposable income of households in \nQinghai is lower than the national average or about one-third that of Beijing or Shanghai. Within Qinghai, rural \nhouseholds' per capita disposable income is about one-third that of urban households. National Bureau of Statistics \nof the PRC. 2017. China Statistical Yearbook 2017.

The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  by  reducing  inequality  in  access  to \nopportunities  and  promoting  rural  development.  ADB\u2019s  strategic  priorities  in  the  country \npartnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC include supporting green and inclusive development \nand reducing poverty and inequality. ADB will assist the PRC government\u2019s efforts in reducing \npoverty, particularly in the lesser-developed regions of the PRC (footnote 1). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) competitive tourist routes and products \nwith Silk Road features created; and (ii) holistic tourism supporting local features and ecological \nprotection promoted.10 The TA will have the following outcome: sustainable, inclusive, and \nregionally integrated tourism policies adopted.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  The TA team will provide knowledge support to the Qinghai government to formulate \npractical solutions (i) for sustainable regional tourism development, and (ii) to consult with tourism \ninstitutions in and outside of Qinghai for potential regional tourism cooperation in the future. The \nTA team will provide support through research, capacity development workshops and study tours, \nand policy and institutional advice. It will assist the evaluation of the existing tourism policies and \nprovide inputs to the Qinghai Provincial Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u20132025 and the Qinghai \ngovernment\u2019s tourism policy formulation. \n \n11.  Output 1: Integrated institutional mechanism for regional tourism development \nproposed.  The  TA  will  provide  a  forum  for  tourism-related  local  administration  officers, \ninternational and national experts, and local businesses to exchange ideas on institutional and \nimplementation mechanism relating to (i) coordination between Qinghai local administrations and \ntourism destinations; and (ii) coordination between neighboring northwestern provinces and \nregions on tourism development. The TA team will support the organization of workshops and \nprepare recommendations for local governments to design a cooperation and implementation \nmechanism for sustainable regional tourism. Through this activity, Qinghai will explore the local \nand international inbound tourism market, integrate outbound and domestic tourism markets, \nstrengthen tourism cooperation between PRC regions, discuss a development and marketing plan \nfor inbound tourism, and promote exchanges between people who have common interests in \ncultural and ethnic background. \n \n12.  Output 2: Sustainable, competitive, and practical regional tourism development \nstrategy for Qinghai proposed. The TA team will support the implementing agency and key \nlocal policy makers in deepening the understanding of and capacity for sustainable tourism \ndevelopment by (i) collecting and analyzing data on the current situation of Qinghai tourism, \nespecially as regards regional cooperation and cultural aspects, and identifying bottlenecks and \nother problems; (ii) learning about national and international good practices and case studies of \nsustainable  and  regional  tourism  development;  and  (iii) preparing  policy  analysis  and \nrecommendations covering (a) tourism product development and route planning; (b) tourism \n                                                \n10 Government of the PRC, National Development and Reform Commission; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Ministry of \nCommerce. 2015.
