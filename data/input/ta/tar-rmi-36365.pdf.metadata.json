In January 2003, the Nitijela (legislature) of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) \nestablished the Economic Policy, Planning, and Statistics Office (EPPSO) as an advisory body \nwithin the Government, with responsibility for developing sound economic policies and strategic \nplanning.1 During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwas asked to assist the Government in strengthening EPPSO.2 The aim of this technical \nassistance  (TA)  is  to  support  EPPSO  through  institution  building  and  assistance  in \nmacroeconomic policy formulation, statistical analysis, and in applying a new participatory \napproach to budgeting, policy formulation, and monitoring. The Government and ADB reached \nan understanding on the goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and \nfinancing arrangements of the TA during the Fact-Finding Mission fielded in March 2003. The \nTA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Created as an advisory body under the Office of the President, EPPSO absorbed the \ntasks of the former Office of Planning and Statistics and assumed new functions related to \nbudget and policy planning, implementation, and monitoring, as well as aid coordination. It has \nthree  units:  (i)  Policy  and  Strategy  Development;  (ii)  Statistics  and  Analysis;  and  (iii) \nPerformance  Monitoring,  Evaluation,  and  Aid  Coordination.  Appendix  2  shows  EPPSO\u2019s \nstructure and lines of responsibility. \n \n3.  EPPSO  has  a  potentially  significant  role  to  play  in  RMI\u2019s  social  and  economic \ndevelopment process. According to its constituent legislation, EPPSO will (i) create 5-year \neconomic policy statements (EPS), to be updated annually; (ii) identify the main EPS goals and \nobjectives  and  link  them  to  sector  development  strategies;  (iii)  conduct  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the economic provisions of the Compact of Free Association with the United \nStates (US) and related agreements, and serve as Secretariat for the RMI- US Joint Economic \nReview  Board  (established  to  administer  new  Compact  funding);3  (iv)  prepare  quarterly \nmonitoring reports on the budget and major economic projects for submission to the National \nPlanning  and  Coordination  Committee  (NPCC);  and  (v)  function  as  the  national  agency \nresponsible for collecting, analyzing, and publishing social and economic statistics. \n \n4.  Since 1995, ADB has been assisting the RMI with advisory TAs, in particular addressed \nto the Ministry of Finance (MOF).4 A recent TA provided advisory services to the Government \n                                                 \n1  Nitijela of the Marshall Islands: 24th Constitutional Regular Session, 2003, Bills 118 and 119. \n2  The TA was originally called \u201cImplementing a Medium-Term Budget Framework and Improving Effective Delivery of \nPublic Services\u201d, and included in the 2002 Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU). The Government and \nADB agreed to change the title of the proposed TA to \u201cStrengthening the Economic Policy, Planning, and Statistics \nOffice\u201d, to revise its objective and scope, and increase its budget.  The TA first appeared in ADB Business \nOpportunities (Internet Edition) on 8 January 2003. \n3 The RMI and US governments are currently finalizing an amended version of Title II (Economic Relations) of the \nCompact of Free Association, which regulates the transfer of funds from the US to the RMI for a 20-year period \nstarting in FY2004. These funds cover a substantial share (expected to be close to 40% in FY2004) of total \nrevenues and grants in the RMI budget. The amended Compact follows an initial 15-year agreement on US-RMI \neconomic relations (FY1986-01) extended to 2003 and regulating the transfer of funds from the US to assist RMI\u2019s \neconomy and also compensating Kwajalein landowners for military use of the atoll. \n4 ADB. 1995.

Based on \nthese reports, one of EPPSO\u2019s strategic functions is to assist the Cabinet and MOF in particular \nin formulating medium-term development plans for the country, while identifying the most \nappropriate means to effectively monitor government policies. \n \n5.  Given the increased accountability and economic planning requirements embodied in \nthe amended Compact agreement (Compact phase II) with the US,7 EPPSO needs assistance \nin preparing effective macroeconomic and fiscal policy advice, and capacity strengthening to \nperform its functions (para. 3).8 \n \n6.  EPPSO\u2019s role will be to reconcile various stakeholders\u2019 interests and perspectives on the \ncountry's development agenda. This TA aims to support such role through the creation of a task \nforce (TF). The TA will help prepare the necessary legislation to establish the TF and define its \nrole and powers. The members of the TF are to be selected from the Government and civil \nsociety, according to rules and regulations to be proposed by EPPSO and endorsed by the \nGovernment. The proposed TF composition is shown in Appendix 2. In principle, while the \nGovernment maintains the chair, TF representatives from the Marshallese civil society will \noutnumber  the  Government  representatives.  The  proposed  number  is  seven:  three  from \nGovernment and four from non-Government institutions that represent the private sector and \nnon government organizations (NGOs) interested in social development issues, such as youth \nand gender. The EPPSO director is proposed to be the TF secretary. \n \n7.  With  regard  to  statistics  functions,  a  recent  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance \nCentre (PFTAC) report9 suggests the adoption of a 3-year work program - including areas such \nas trade, labor, and banking statistics - and identifies serious staffing constraints in EPPSO\u2019s \nStatistics and Analysis unit. The report supports EPPSO\u2019s plan to increase statistical staff at \nleast from four to five and suggests that RMI authorities and aid agencies supplement this with \nthe provision of an economic statistics advisor to assist in building local capacity. \n \n8.  Considering the increased internal and external challenges the country is facing, the \ntiming of the TA is particularly appropriate to support the institutional development process \nbegun by the Government. The combination within one agency of (i) advisory functions for \nbudget  and  policy  formulation,  implementation,  and  monitoring;  (ii)  aid  coordination;  and \n                                                                                                                                                             \nADB. 2001.

The new final \nagreement is expected to be approved and ratified by the respective legislative bodies before December 2003.  \n8 While assistance to EPPSO for fiscal policy advice will be provided in close coordination with the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF), it is clear that typical budgetary functions remain with MOF. \n9 PFTAC.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The ultimate goal of the project is to assist the RMI\u2019s long-term economic development \nand poverty reduction by means of institutional development and increased local stakeholders \nparticipation, leading to effective budget and policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring, \nand production of social and economic statistics.11 In particular, the TA will support EPPSO\u2019s \ndevelopment and improved performance by providing consulting services, training programs, \nand specific equipment. At the same time, it is understood that joint efforts by the consultants \nengaged for this project and EPPSO staff, in close coordination with the donor community are \nvital for the success of the TA. \n \n10.  The Government has agreed to allocate an adequate budget for EPPSO\u2019s staffing needs \nand to identify suitable staff to fill vacant EPPSO positions, particularly the three unit chief posts. \nNew legislation defining the role and powers of the TF and a mechanism to ensure that TF\u2019s \nreports and recommendations receive proper attention from Government and are reflected in its \nagenda are also an explicit Government commitment to ensure the success of the project. The \nGovernment will also provide adequate office space for EPPSO. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s experience in the RMI and similar countries demonstrates that human resource \ndevelopment  and  capacity\u2013building  activities  need  to  be  part  of  a  long-term  development \nstrategy. The outcome of assistance through advisory services has shown to depend in the first \nplace on the availability of human resources, their quality, skill level, and motivation. \n \n12.  The broad outputs of the TA are the following: \n(i)  clearer definition of EPPSO\u2019s role and functions through assistance in preparing \na strategic plan and operations manual for EPPSO; \n(ii)  capacity\u2013building, staffing, and training plans for EPPSO, based on a needs \nanalysis and EPPSO\u2019s strategic plan; \n(iii)  assistance in establishing and operationalizing the TF, and technical support \nduring its initial period of operation; \n(iv)  on-the-job-training and capacity building support to EPPSO to enable developing \nits ability to fulfill its mandates in the areas of policy analysis and formulation, \nplanning, and monitoring; and \n(v)  provision of minor office equipment in support of the TA\u2019s objectives. \nA detailed list of the deliverables under the TA is in the TA framework (Appendix 1). \n \n                                                 \n10 Created as an advisory board, EPPSO will not interfere in the usual functions of other ministries and Government \nagencies and will not be directly administering funds related to development projects and programs. As far as \nbudgetary functions are concerned, it is also clear that these remain with MOF.  \n11 Given the limited resources, the TA will not directly fund activities related to aid coordination included in EPPSO\u2019s \nfunctions and operations under Unit 3 of its current structure. Local capacity for aid coordination seems adequate \nand in the case of further need in the future, other projects from ADB and/or other sources may be able to fill the \ngap. In any case, it is clear that EPPSO\u2019s aid-coordination role does not imply direct funds administration, but \nidentification of needs and opportunities for assistance from the aid community, in the context of the country\u2019s \nsocial and economic development plans. ", "4 \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The methodology adopted to implement the TA involves intermittent consulting services \nin the areas of (i) institutional development and participatory approach, (ii) macroeconomic \npolicy analysis and formulation, and (iii) social and economic statistics. \n \n14.  To  identify  the  various  interests  that  need  to  be  considered  when  making  public \ndecisions,  a  stakeholder  analysis  will  be  conducted  during  the  initial  period  of  TA \nimplementation.  Such  analysis  will  assess  the  interests  and  expectations  of  the  various \nconstituents involved in public policy outcomes, the nature of the stakeholders, and the degree \nor intensity of their interest. From the definition of stakeholders, the analysis will determine their \nrelative importance for different policies and will attempt to evaluate resources that stakeholders \ncan mobilize to induce changes. Stakeholder analysis is an important step in introducing a \nparticipatory approach to policy formulation and monitoring, and is also highly relevant in \nidentifying the proper composition of the TF. \n \n15.  The provision of assistance for macroeconomic (particularly fiscal) policy formulation will \nbe closely coordinated with MOF, the NPCC, the Budget Coordination Committee, and the \nministries involved in introducing performance budgeting. \n \n16.  The successful creation and management of the TF are a major challenge for EPPSO. \nThe TF\u2019s primary function is to produce reports and recommendations (to be submitted to the \nCabinet and later disseminated to the public) on issues related to budget and policy formulation, \nimplementation, and monitoring. The creation of a TF will therefore increase awareness among \nthe people of the strategic directions taken by the Government and facilitate the formation of \nrealistic expectations as far as policy outcomes are concerned. Apart from serving as a conduit \nto channel expertise from, and reflect the interests of, different stakeholders, the TF can help \nease tensions and misunderstandings that may arise between the Government and civil society, \nespecially the business community. Ultimately, the TF can create an important reference for \nregular, decision-making participation leading to improved performance for the country\u2019s social \nand economic development.12 \n \n17.  Statistics  advisory  services  and  analysis  will  be  provided  in  accordance  with  the \ncountry\u2019s  development  agenda  and  following  the  recommendations  of  the  PFTAC  report \nassessing the country\u2019s needs vis-\u00e0-vis EPPSO\u2019s capacity in terms of statistical knowledge and \noutput.  Main  statistical  areas  for  assistance  include  (i)  national  accounts,  (ii)  trade,  and \n(iii) revenues and taxes. \n                                                 \n12 Other countries\u2019 experience in using a participatory approach suggests that two main factors for successfully \ninteracting with civil society and the business community are the  adoption of an entrepreneurial approach in \nmanaging the TF and effective communication and organizational skills in the individuals entrusted to create and \nadminister that TF. A well-defined and structured set of guidelines is also required for the TF to be functional. In \naddition,  adoption  of  transparency  and  accountability  principles,  outcome  orientation,  use  of  measurable \nperformance indicators to evaluate policy impact, and efforts to increase visibility and dissemination of outcomes \nare the main principles to follow in managing EPPSO in general and the TF in particular. It is anticipated that \nexperts will be invited during the TF meetings to present their views and research findings to contribute to the \npreparation of the TF reports and recommendations. The TA budget includes a provision for the TF reports and \nother material produced to increase awareness of Government policies, their nature, and assessed impact. ", "5 \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $500,000. \nThe Government will provide the balance of $150,000 equivalent through in-kind contributions \n \nand local staff salaries. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The Office of the President of the RMI will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will \nbe responsible for monitoring and supervising TA activities, providing administrative counterpart \nsupport to the consultants, and ensuring proper follow-up activities after completion of the TA. \nEPPSO will be the Implementing Agency. A steering committee (SC) will be established to \nmonitor the TA\u2019s performance and guide EPPSO. Members of the SC will be the chief secretary, \none representative of MOF, and one representative of another ministry to be appointed by the \nOffice of the President. \n \n20.  ADB will recruit a team of 3-5 international consultants and 1 local consultant individually \nand in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will provide \nintermittent consulting services of approximately 18 person-months from a team of international \nconsultants and 6 person-months from a local consultant. The team of international consultants \nwill comprise (i) 1 institutional development specialist with extensive experience in participatory \napproaches, stakeholder analysis, policy formulation, and monitoring; and with individual skills \nand qualities to facilitate the formation of the TF, motivate its members, and assist in TF \nactivities (4 person-months, 2-3 trips); (ii) 1 macroeconomic and fiscal policy expert who will be \nseconded at and work in close coordination with MOF and other relevant Government agencies \n(8 person-months, 2-3 trips); and (iii) 1-3 statistics advisors with expertise in the areas of \nnational accounts, trade, and revenues/tax statistics (6 person-months, 2-3 trips). The local \nconsultant will serve as local coordinator and facilitate participation by local stakeholders. His or \nher main task will be to assist the institutional development specialist, particularly in facilitating \nthe TF to become and effectively operating agency, motivating the TF members and ensuring \nthe delivery of quality outputs. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix \n4. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over approximately 24 months, beginning January 2004. \nEPPSO will assign counterpart staff to assist each consultant. The institutional development \nspecialist, the fiscal policy expert, and the local consultant will produce inception, midterm, and \nfinal reports, while each statistics consultant will prepare one inception and one final report. The \nreports prepared by consultants will be submitted to the SC, EPPSO, MOF, the TF, and ADB. \nThe institutional development expert and the local consultant will also help organize at least one \nworkshop to increase awareness of Government policy and facilitate participation, especially by \nindividuals residing in the outer islands, and provide them with an opportunity to contribute to \nthe definition of the country\u2019s social and economic development agenda. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Marshall Islands for Strengthening the Economic Policy, Planning, and \nStatistics Office, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
