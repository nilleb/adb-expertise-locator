INTRODUCTION \n \n1.   In  January  2012,  the  Department  of  Finance\u2013National  Credit  Council  (DOF\u2013NCC) \nasked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nto develop microinsurance in the Philippines and promote financial inclusion. The government \nrequested  ADB  to  follow  up  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  Developing \nMicroinsurance Project completed in September 2012 .1 The fact-finding mission was conducted \nfrom 18 to 20 July 2012 in conjunction with the review mission for the JFPR grant. The DOF\u2013\nNCC (the government\u2019s executing agency) and the Insurance Commission (the government\u2019s \nimplementing  agency)  agreed  on  the  proposed  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference as laid out in the approved \nconcept paper. Although the proposed TA was not included in the country operations business \nplan, 2010\u201320122 under the country partnership strategy, 2011\u201320163 for the Philippines, the \nconcept paper was approved by the Vice-President of Operations 2 on 27 September 2012 in \nview of the benefits for low-income households in terms of social safety net and disaster risk \nfinancing  supported  by  the  public\u2013private  partnership  approach.  The  project  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Background.  ADB  has  been  one  of  the  few  very  active  development  partners  for \nmicrofinance  development  in  the  Philippines,  and  has  contributed  to  the  growth  of  formal \nmicrofinance activities. After several TA projects ADB approved the Microfinance Development \nProgram5  whose  objectives  included  expanding  the  outreach  of  diversified  formal  financial \nservices to poor clients at the most affordable cost. Increased microfinance activities for  poor \nclients has the risk of making them worse off through unexpected events, unless some form of \nsafety net can be provided through microinsurance. This gave rise to the formulation of the \nJFPR grant, approved in 2008, to complement efforts under the Microfinance Development \nProgram  to  further  financial  inclusion.  It  was  the  first  ADB  intervention  focusing  on \nmicroinsurance development. The grant was completed in September 2012. The following are \nmajor achievements under the JFPR grant: \n    \n3.  Improving regulatory framework. While the National Strategy for Microinsurance was \nformulated  with  support  from  German  development  cooperation  through  GIZ  International \nServices, the regulatory framework and performance standards were revised and enhanced \nunder the grant to facilitate private sector participation (targeting the supply side). Following the \napproval of the Regulatory Framework for Microinsurance by government authorities in 2010, \npertinent Insurance Commission circulars were issued after a series of consultative discussions \nat the technical working group (TWG) involving a wide range of stakeholders from both the \npublic and private sectors. DOF\u2013NCC, the Insurance Commission, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, and the Cooperative Development Authority coordinated the efforts through a joint \nsteering committee to implement the regulations and issued joint circulars for formalization of \nthe microinsurance sector.6  \n                                                \n1  ADB.  2008.

Strengthening  the  capacity  of  government  regulators  and  microinsurance \nproviders.  The  microinsurance  regulations,  pertinent  rules,  and  performance  standards \ndeveloped under the grant were disseminated to the public and stakeholders, particularly to \ninsurance providers licensed by the Insurance Commission. Training materials, including the \nperformance standards compliance procedures, were developed and institutionalized through \nthe concerned TWG and training sessions were conducted for insurance providers. The training \nalso included preparation of the revised annual statements (to include microinsurance data) to \nbe submitted by the insurance providers to the commission. \n  \n5.  Promoting financial literacy on microinsurance. A Roadmap to Financial Literacy on \nMicroinsurance7  was  adopted  and  a  nationwide  advocacy  campaign  has  been  under \nimplementation  since  2011  (approach  to  the  demand  side).  From  a  very  early  stage  of \ndevelopment, signs of increased demand for microinsurance products and services have been \npositive, and a growing confidence exists in the role of the microfinance industry to achieve \ninclusive finance. The advocacy campaign was initially designed on a pilot basis, but expanded \nto  the  regional  level  with  support  from  German  development  cooperation  through  GIZ \nInternational Services. \n \n6.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Integrated  Disaster  Risk  Management  Program,8  insurance \nprotection\u2014especially  microinsurance  for  low-income  households\u2014has  been  identified  an \neffective ex ante disaster risk finance tool. The proposed TA links the  JFPR grant (footnote 1) \nand  the  Disaster  Risk  Financing  Project  programmed  for  2015,  which  will  involve \nmicroinsurance service for disaster risks  as one of the major components of the ensuing loan. \nSome of the prerequisite work will be carried out under the TA. \n \n7.  The following are the key remaining issues identified to be covered under the TA. \n \n8.  Insufficient  level  playing  field  for  microinsurance  providers.  The  definition  of \nmicroinsurance product has been formulated and the product registration requirement has been \nimplemented under the regulation. For microinsurance products, a level playing field has been \nestablished for all microinsurance providers, regardless of the form of the entities, and reliable \nstatistics have been made available. However, the current regulation remains vague in certain \naspects of capital requirements, which risks regulatory arbitrage. Under the JFPR grant, a two-\ntier approach was taken to allow more concessional capital requirements, mainly for emerging \nmutual benefit associations, which encouraged them to cater especially to poor clients.  \n  \n9.  Lack  of  capacity  to  develop  new microinsurance  products. The microinsurance \nsector  started  mainly  with  simple  and  easy-to-understand  products. With  expansion  of the \nsector,  innovative  products  like  parametric-  or  index-type  insurance  products  have  been \nintroduced on a pilot basis. The capacity of the supervisors needs to be enhanced to catch up \nwith these new developments, specifically to review the products properly and issue approvals \non a timely basis.   \n \n10.  Need  for  more  efficient  distribution  network.  Microinsurance  development  still \ndepends on its traditional distribution network, including agents, although ADB\u2019s support for \nmicrofinance  development  enabled  microfinance  institutions  and  community-based \norganizations (nongovernment organizations, mutual benefit associations, and cooperatives) to \nplay active roles as delivery channels. Efficient administration costs, in addition to pure risk \n                                                \n7  DOF-NCC. 2010. A Roadmap to Financial Literacy on Microinsurance.

Manila.  \n ", "3 \npremium,  will  determine  the  affordability  of  products to  low-income  people. The  Insurance \nCommission  should  promote  the  development  of  cost-effective  administration,  including \npaperless contracts via mobile, e-payments for both premiums and claims, and engagement of \na broader range of intermediaries (e.g., points of sale, pharmacies, and remittance centers). \nThe  Insurance  Commission  should  create  the  regulatory  environment  enabling  these \ninnovations through amendments to current regulations or timely issuance of new ones. \n \n11.  Inadequate consumer protection scheme for microinsurance business. At this early \nstage of microinsurance development, consumers are beginning to see challenges in terms of \nconsumer protection. These need to be tackled in a more systematic manner. Mainly because \nof the nature of many small transactions, the traditional dispute resolution scheme will not be \nappropriate for the microinsurance business. Filing in court is too expensive for low-income \nhouseholds and filing complaints with the authorities does not provide enough accessibility for \nthe policyholders. Many policyholders are low-income households in rural areas that require \nmore  simplified  and  affordable  alternative  dispute  resolution  mechanisms.  The  discussion \namong stakeholders started in May 2012 but the Insurance Commission needs further support \nfor drafting regulations and their implementation. \n \n12.  Further need for financial literacy at local government unit level. Under the JFPR \ngrant, a Roadmap to Financial Literacy on Microinsurance was adopted and the first nationwide \nfinancial literacy campaign was conducted at the regional level (footnote 7). The response to \ndate has been positive but this campaign should be extended to the local government unit (LGU) \nlevel. Based on the assessment of the impacts by the first campaign, including a pilot project in \nQuezon City, the program will have to better suit the needs of the LGUs in terms of modality and \ndelivery mechanism. \n \n13.  Sustaining momentum on coordinated activities among stakeholders. One of the \nkey success factors for the grant was effective coordination among stakeholders, led by the joint \nsteering committee and TWGs. For example, DOF, the Insurance Commission, the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, and the Cooperative Development Authority issued a joint circular \nbased on consultation under these groups. The TA will provide technical support to those \nactivities, including seminars and workshops. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The  impact  will  be  more  affordable  contingent  risk  insurance  among  low-income \nhouseholds, including climate change and natural disasters. The outcome will be an expanded \nmicroinsurance market, in terms of market size and number of players. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  Output 1: Improved level playing field for microinsurance providers. A diagnostic \nstudy on the challenges faced by microinsurance providers, including a risk-based supervisory \nand monitoring system, will be conducted with support from the TA consultants. While new \nregulations on risk-based capital requirements will be prepared with inputs from TA consultants, \nthe  enabling  environment  for  small  microinsurance  providers  should  be  maintained.  A \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ntransitional,  well-crafted,  and  transparent  policy  seeking  an  eventual  level  playing  field  is \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nneeded  for  prudential  capital  management  against  the  risk  undertaking  and  to  protect \npolicyholders.  The results of the study will be shared with both regulators and microinsurance \n ", "4 \nproviders through the workshops, and the draft government regulations should reflect various \nstakeholders\u2019 views. \n \n16.  Output  2:  Improved  capacity  to  develop  new  microinsurance  products. A gap \nanalysis of capacity development of regulators for new microinsurance products, including index \nand parametric types, will be conducted. Based on the results, a capacity development plan will \nbe formulated with support from the TA consultants. Required training for regulators by TA \nconsultants will follow.   \n \n17.  Output 3: More efficient distribution network. Innovative distribution networks, like \nmobile payments and e-payment, involve jurisdictions other than the financial sector. The review \nof the current regulatory environment should be necessary to enable innovations including \ncashless transactions. Consultations among concerned government agencies are essential to \nidentify areas where amendments are needed, and to issue new ones on a timely basis. The TA \nwill  support  a  review  of  the  current  regulatory  environment  and  the  preparation  of  new \nregulations. \n \n18.  Output 4: Established consumer protection scheme for microinsurance business. \nIn view of the limited access to and capacity of the formal dispute resolution system, the \nenforceable market conducts for microinsurance providers  with proper system for handling \ncustomer complaints by microinsurance providers themselves are necessary to improve the \naccess. The monitoring and reporting system backed by regulations will be formulated with \nsupport  from  the  TA.  This  will  be  based  on  an  understanding  between  regulators  and \nmicroinsurance  providers  that  consumer  protection  is  essential  for  development  of  the \nmicroinsurance business. \n \n19.  Output 5: Enhanced financial literacy campaign formulated at local government \nunit level and production of knowledge products. An impact assessment on the national \nfinancial literacy campaign during 2011\u20132012 under the JFPR grant, including a pilot project \nwith Quezon City government, will be conducted and the analysis on the area where further \nintervention is needed at LGU level to expand the coverage. A knowledge and communication \nplan will be developed, with contents, target group, and delivery means identified. The results of \nthe  impact  assessment  and  draft  knowledge  and  communication  plan  will  be  shared  and \ndiscussed with the concerned stakeholders for implementation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the JFPR and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support \nin  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years, from March 2013 to March 2016. DOF\u2013NCC \nwill be the executing agency, while the Insurance Commission will be the implementing agency. \nThis  is  the  same  arrangement  as for the JFPR  grant.  For  the  implementation  of training, \nseminars,  and  conferences  proposed  under  the  TA,  an  advance  payment  facility  will  be \nestablished at the executing agency. \n \n22.  The  project  requires  a  diverse  mix  of  experts  (four  international  consultants  with \n18 person-months of inputs and five national consultants with 96 person-months of inputs), with \n ", "5 \nexpertise in microinsurance business development, insurance supervision, consumer protection, \ninformation, education, communication, and financial literacy. Because of the specialized nature \nof the assignments, it is difficult to identify a sufficient number of consulting firms that could \nassemble a high-quality team of experts. Therefore, individual consultants will be recruited. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) for the production of \nmaterials.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The eligibility or \nineligibility  of  expenditures  will  be  guided  by  JFPR  policies  and  guidelines  for  technical \nassistance. 9 The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are outlined in Appendix 3. \n \n23.  In addition to the main outputs, the consultants will submit to ADB and the executing \nagency (i) an inception report 1 month after commencement of services; (ii) interim progress \nreports at appropriate stages during TA implementation; (iii) the draft summary final report for \nthe overall TA before the conclusion of the contract; and (iv) a revised final report 1 month after \nreceiving and taking into account the comments of, and feedback from, the executing agency, \nother stakeholders, and ADB. \n \n24.  The executing agency and ADB review missions will regularly monitor and report on \nmajor  project  activities.  Consultants\u2019 reports  will  be  presented  in  workshops  and  seminars \norganized for the validation of findings. Reports will be made available on ADB websites and \npublished whenever warranted for the meetings for stakeholders. Knowledge products will be \ndeveloped and disseminated as planned.  \n \n25.  The TA will also support stakeholders\u2019 consultations on issues related to microinsurance \nthrough the platform established under the JFPR grant, the joint steering committee, and the \nTWGs to maintain the capacity of coordinated efforts among stakeholders. The joint steering \ncommittee  and  the  TWGs  have  proven  to  be  very  effective,  not  only  to  intake  various \nstakeholders\u2019 views but also to disseminate the results of TA activities.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Capacity Building for Microinsurance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n9  ADB.
