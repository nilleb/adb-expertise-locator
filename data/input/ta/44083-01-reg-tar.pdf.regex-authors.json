INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  has  requested,  through  the \nASEAN Capital Market Forum (ACMF) and the ASEAN Secretariat (ASEC), further technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to address issues regarding the \nImplementation  Plan  2015  (IP  2015)  for  regional  capital  market  integration.  The  ACMF  is \nentrusted with developing the IP 2015 for an integrated capital market in ASEAN and freer \ncapital flows. Previous TA projects1 in this area culminated in the submission of the IP 2015, \nwhich was endorsed at the 13th ASEAN Finance Ministers Meeting in Pattaya on 9 April \n2009. 2 The  IP  2015  sets  out  a  broad  framework  to  strengthen  ASEAN  capital  market \ndevelopment and integration by 2015. It offers a comprehensive set of initiatives under three \nbroad themes: (i) creating an enabling environment for regional integration, (ii) creating market \ninfrastructure and regionally focused products and intermediaries, and (iii) strengthening the \nimplementation process. The key underlying principles of the IP 2015 are the adoption of global \nstandards to the extent possible, progressive liberalization to facilitate more open access, cost \nreduction through greater competition, and the engagement of ASEC as the main coordinator. \nThis TA will support the implementation of recommendations and action plans specified in the   \nIP 2015 on regional capital market integration.3 The TA is in line with the ADB Strategy 2020 for \nwhich finance sector development and regional integration and cooperation are two of five core \nstrategies.4 Support for capital market integration5 will be essential to sustaining growth and \nproviding  access  to  economic  opportunities  in  the  region,  and  will  help  move  regional \ncooperation and integration forward. Regional and national consultations were undertaken at \nACMF meetings on 18 August 2009 and 25 February 2010 and during a mission to Malaysia on \n26\u201329 January 2010. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   Financial crisis. Although Southeast Asian countries have made substantial progress in \nstrengthening financial markets and enhancing regional integration, the recent financial crisis \nhas caused a setback. Domestic market capitalization in United States dollars at the end of \n2008 dropped by 53.3% in Indonesia, 41.8% in Malaysia, 49.4% in the Philippines, 50.8% in \nSingapore and 47.7% in Thailand compared with the preceding year. There were improvements \nby the end of 2009, although only the Indonesian stock exchange had surpassed its 2007 level.6 \nGiven the global nature of the financial crisis, the ASEAN Finance Ministers recognized at their \nmeeting in Pattaya that managing the challenges is a joint responsibility and the urgent need to \nenhance financial resilience in the region by further integrating regional financial markets. The \nmeeting agreed that the priorities for ASEAN are to enhance regional financial stability and \nfurther integrate its financial markets as a region to achieve the goals of the ASEAN Economic \nCommunity (AEC) Blueprint, which provides a roadmap for monetary and financial integration of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Asian Financial Markets. Manila (TA 5985-REG); ADB. 2005. \nTechnical Assistance for Supporting Enhanced Cooperation among Southeast Asian Equity Markets. Manila (TA \n6298-REG); and ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Southeast Asian Financial Markets. Manila \n(TA 6473-REG).  \n2  Per the joint media statement of the 13th ASEAN Finance Ministers Meeting in Pattaya on 9 April 2009, promoting \nan interlinked ASEAN regional capital market is one of the key priorities toward achieving the ASEAN Economic \nCommunity in 2015.   \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 February 2010. \n4  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank.

Statistics. www.world-exchanges.org (accessed 12 July 2010). \n ", "2   \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nASEAN in the areas of capital market development, financial services liberalization, and capital \naccount liberalization. \n3.  Specific to capital market development, the meeting agreed to continue to broaden and \ndeepen regional capital markets through measures that enhance market access, liquidity, and \nlinkages and promote ASEAN as an asset class. To foster cross-border financial flows and \nlinkages,  the  region's  immediate  priority  is  to  create  an  enabling  environment  and  market \ninfrastructure  to  facilitate  cross-border  investments,  strengthen  institutional  capacity  in  the \nmarkets, and maintain outward-oriented policies.  \n4.   Levels of economic and market development. Another constraint on progress toward \nregional capital market integration in ASEAN is significant differences in member countries\u2019 \nlevels of economic development and observance of regulatory standards. This is compounded \nby  various  capital  controls,  fragmented  infrastructure,  and  insufficient  coordination  and \nmonitoring  mechanisms.  The  key  challenge,  therefore,  is  to  implement  a  well-sequenced \nprogram of regional integration initiatives, supported by national capital market development \nprograms  with  regional  considerations,  and  reinforced  with  a  well-designed  ASEAN-wide \nmonitoring and coordination mechanism during implementation.7 \n5.  ADB has helped address these issues by assisting and providing support to the ACMF.8 \nThis TA builds on ADB's support through the Financial Sector, Public Management and Trade \nDivision (SEFM) to the ACMF and ASEC. In May 2001, ADB approved a TA under which a \nseries of studies were prepared that provided an in-depth analysis of banking and capital \nmarkets in East Asia. This was followed by a TA in 2005 which initiated consultation in ASEAN \nto  develop  a  strategic  framework  for  enhanced  cooperation  in  capital  markets.  To  ensure \ncontinuity,  ADB  approved  a  TA  in  2008  that  helped  ACMF  to  develop  IP  2015  and  built \nconsensus through workshops and conferences. \n6.  The endorsement of IP 2015 by the ASEAN Finance Ministers sent a strong signal to \nresponsible parties to facilitate the implementation of the initiatives to achieve the objectives of \nthe AEC Blueprint 2015 by offering a comprehensive set of strategic initiatives and specific \nimplementation actions and milestones.  \n7.  In line with its broad themes, IP 2015 covers six broad initiatives or core strategies:        \n(i) a mutual recognition framework and comparable legal and enforcement framework, including \nstrong investor protection and a scheme to resolve disputes and facilitate cross-border fund-\nraising  and  investment;  (ii)  an  ASEAN  exchange  alliance  and  governance  framework  for \nregional linkages and new product development to support regional capital market integration; \n(iii) developing ASEAN as an asset class by promoting private sector-led regional product \ndevelopment, promoting ASEAN star companies on the ASEAN board, and developing and \nintegrating Islamic finance markets; (iv) the further regional development and integration of bond \nmarkets; (v) reinforcing the ASEAN working process; and (vi) aligning national development \ninitiatives to support cross-border integration and the adoption of phased market liberalization.9 \n                                                 \n7  The Southeast Asia Financial Sector, Public Management, and Trade Division of ADB has ongoing financial sector \nlending programs in Cambodia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam and technical assistance projects in Cambodia, \nIndonesia, and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.   \n8  A high-level forum of securities regulators in ASEAN created under the auspices of the ASEAN Finance Ministers \nin April 2004. \n9  ADB support to the ACMF has been instrumental, as has been the participation of a group of experts drawn from \nthe private sector who have acted as sounding board and advisory body. \n ", "  3 \n \n8.   In addition, support is also needed for the ASEAN exchange alliance framework,10 as it \nis a tangible platform for distributing financial products and linking markets, leading to the AEC \n2015. The framework primarily needs to establish the single ASEAN Board and an interlinked \ntechnology platform that will enhance the ability of investors in one market to trade securities \nlisted on another market. In the process, ASEAN exchanges aim to (i) increase cross-border \ntrading among ASEAN markets; (ii) strengthen the visibility of ASEAN as an asset class; and    \n(iii) attract more international funds into ASEAN. \n \n9.   Alignment  of  national  capital  markets  with  the  regional  agenda.  Meeting  the \nobjectives of the IP 2015 will require a strategy that ensures regional coordination but allows for \nnational differentiation, given the significant differences among members in terms of economic \nand financial sector development, openness of the economy, and legal regimes. In this context, \nsupport  is  needed  to  help  the  ACMF  and  ASEC  in  their  regional  work  and  the  national \nauthorities  in  implementing  the  IP  2015  at  the  country  level.  This  will  help  translate  the \nobjectives of the IP 2015 into specific tasks and tailor implementation to national circumstances. \n \n10.  Barriers to capital market integration. Robust regional capital markets are essential to \ndiversify the sources of funding necessary to support long-term investments and sustain high \ngrowth levels. At this juncture, it is crucial to successfully implement the IP 2015. Implementing \nthe IP 2015 is not without significant challenges. First is to ensure that the ASEAN Finance \nMinisters Meeting endorsement leads to concrete actions at the national level. Second, is to \ninvolve  other  areas  of  national  policymaking  towards  removing  obstacles  and  barriers  to \nintegration.  Restrictions  on  capital  movements  and  disparities  in  tax  regimes  have  been \nidentified as major impediments to financial market integration.  \n \n11.   This risk will be mitigated by ADB support provided by the Office of Regional Economic \nIntegration (OREI) to ASEAN central banks toward developing a framework for integrating the \nbanking sector and liberalizing capital account restrictions to permit the free flow of cross-border \nfinance. Recognizing the synergy between the two initiatives, OREI has been part of the SEFM \nteam since 2006. OREI has been consulted at various stages in the design of this TA, and this \ncoordination will continue in implementation. ADB TA supports the ASEAN strategic initiatives of \n(i) regional capital market integration, which this TA proposes, and (ii) financial sector and \ncapital account liberalization, which is led by OREI. These are critical to ASEAN\u2019s attaining its \nstrategic goals by 2015.  \n \n12.  This  TA  will  complement  national  program  loans,  projects,  and  TA  to  support  the \ndevelopment of a robust and diversified financial system in ASEAN. By addressing binding \nnational constraints such as inadequate capacity for supervision and risk management, which \nlimit the scope for greater financial sector opening, it will facilitate greater regional cooperation \nand integration, strengthen the prospects for mutual recognition of governance standards, and \nharmonize the rules needed to deepen regional markets while contributing to financial stability.  \n                                                 \n10  The ASEAN Common Exchange Gateway alliance is expected to help pave the way for the future development of \nback-end linkages involving clearing, settlement, and depositary arrangements.

The agreement will initially involve five countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and \nThailand) each of which will list their top 30 stocks on a single computer screen, known as the ASEAN Bulletin \nBoard. Other countries are expected to join later.  \n ", "4   \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact will be freer and increased capital flow in a more integrated ASEAN capital \nmarket. The outcome will be a more interlinked ASEAN capital market. The TA has been \ncoordinated with work undertaken by OREI in Southeast Asia and will complement it. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will have seven main outputs. First, it will help the ACMF develop and implement \na mutual recognition and harmonization framework. It will support ASEAN stock exchanges to \ndevelop the ASEAN Common Exchange Gateway Blueprint and a system design that will be the \nbasis  of  an  interlinked  ASEAN  capital  market.  The  third  output  is  to  provide  practical \nimplementation of corporate governance best practices and standards including a gap analysis \nstudy and the formulation of corporate governance tools for publicly listed companies in ASEAN, \nwhich will be benchmarked against international standards in conjunction with the Roundtable \non Corporate Governance of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and \nReports on the Observance of Standards and Codes standards. \n \n15.  The  TA  will  help  the  ACMF  build  ASEAN  as  an  asset  class  by  developing  both \nconventional and Islamic regionally oriented products and promoting ASEAN star companies to \nbe listed on the ASEAN board. In addition, the TA will help the ACMF conduct a study on \nregional tax harmonization that will identify gaps and provide recommendations for regional tax \nalignment and harmonization. The TA will also help the ACMF and national jurisdictions to \ndevelop more structured training and develop programs for regulators. Finally, the TA will \nreinforce ASEAN\u2019s working process, policy coordination and transparency, and communication \nstrategy through ASEC and a group of experts. \n \n16.  The major assumptions for the TA are continued commitment by ASEAN countries, \nactive  participation  by  the  private  sector,  and  access  to  information  from  the  various \njurisdictions.  Among  the  potential  medium-term  benefits  to  the  ASEAN  countries  are  the \nestablishment of (i) a mutual recognition framework and comparable legal and enforcement \nframework for cross-border fund-raising, (ii) a system design to serve as the basis for more \ninterlinked ASEAN stock exchanges to facilitate cross-border fund-raising, (iii) ASEAN corporate \ngovernance tools for branding ASEAN as an asset class, and (iv) structured regional capacity \nbuilding for capital markets regulators.11 Risks may be the inability of the governments to honor \ntheir commitments and pursue the six core strategies as outlined in the IP 2015. Resources will \nbe allocated and capacity building will be provided under the TA to mitigate this risk.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000 equivalent of which $1,500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund12 under the Regional Cooperation \nand Integration Financing Partnership Facility and $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (e-Asia program),  both to be \nadministered by ADB. The financing and disbursement arrangements for Investment Climate \nFacilitation Fund and e-Asia program funds will be parallel. The e-Asia program will provide \n                                                 \n11 Country rankings and medium-term benefits to ASEAN countries are discussed in the supplementary appendix, \nwhich is available upon request. \n12 Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5 \nsupport for the second output, promoting ASEAN stock exchange alliances and regionally \noriented products. This assistance will enhance regional cooperation and innovation. The TA \nwill finance regional workshops and seminars to disseminate its findings, gather views on the \nfeasibility of its proposals, and facilitate agreement on new initiatives and actions. No activity will \nbe financed in any member country under this TA unless and until a letter of no objection, if \nneeded, has been received from its government. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented over 20 months, from \nAugust  2010  to  March  2012.  It  will  require  64  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices, including a group of experts to serve as resource persons and an international project \ncoordinator,  and  22  person-months  of  national  consulting  services,  including  two  national \nproject coordinators, costing $1,702,000 for remuneration, travel, per diem, and reports and \ncommunications. Three firms will be engaged in addition to several individual consultants for \nspecific areas. The engagement of the firms will be based on quality and cost at a ratio of 80:20. \nThe group of experts will be engaged individually as resource persons to develop and review a \nconsolidated action plan for 2010\u20132015 and to serve as a central reference for sequencing, \nreprioritizing, and monitoring all strategic initiatives relating to capital market integration. Three \nproject coordinators will be engaged. The international project coordinator and one national \ncoordinator (national capital market expert) will be based in ASEC. The international project \ncoordinator will help interface with members of the ACMF, ASEAN member countries, and ADB \nto help monitor the implementation of the IP 2015. The national capital market expert will help \ndevelop  databases  on  capital  market  development,  and  facilitate  in-house  seminars  and \nworkshops. The final coordinator will be based in ADB to liaise with consultants to coordinate \nimplementation and assist in designing and conducting regional conference and seminars. \nDetails of consultants to be engaged under the firms are in Appendix 3. \u00a0\n \n19.  All consultants and resource persons will be hired according to ADB Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment and office supplies to be \nfinanced  by  the  TA  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  or  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA \nwill be done in accordance with the ADB Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). The terms of reference for all consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility, and (ii) ADB administering technical assistance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea \ne-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for Promoting an Interlinked ASEAN Capital Market, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6       Appendix 1          \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  By 2015:    Assumptions \nFreer and increased  At least five countries in  Annual reports from the  Continued \ncapital flow in a more  ASEAN list at least their  Central Banks and MOF;  macroeconomic stability  \nintegrated ASEAN capital  top 30 stocks on a single  reports and statistics from   \nmarket   computer screen, known  the ASEC, IOSCO, World  Strong national capital \nas the ASEAN Bulletin  Federation of Exchanges,  market development \nBoard for the ASEAN  World Bank, International  plans aligned with \nexchange alliance.
