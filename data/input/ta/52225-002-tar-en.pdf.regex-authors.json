THE ENSUING PROJECT \n1.  The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is committed to structural reforms to effectively \nmanage the transition to sustainable and broad-based economic growth. Policy and institutional \nconstraints that need to be addressed include (i) trade and investment competitiveness; (ii) \ndevelopment of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); (iii) infrastructure development, \nparticularly in the energy sector; and (iv) labor productivity. With Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nsupport since 2008, the Kyrgyz Republic has made significant progress in improving the business \nenvironment  and  investment  climate,  including  improving  access  to  finance  for  SMEs; \nestablishing  an  enabling  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  private  participation  in \ninfrastructure; expanding access to new export markets, particularly the European Union, and \nsimplifying  institutional  processes  and  guidelines  for  exporters;  streamlining  industry  and \ngovernment  interaction  to  ensure  skills  development  is  in  line  with  market  requirements; \nincreasing transparency in government processes, such as procurement; and implementing \nregulations to reduce the cost of doing business and providing incentives to formalize the \neconomy.  \n \n2.  The proposed Promoting Economic Diversification Program will support the government \nin continuing policy and institutional reforms necessary to increase the private sector\u2019s role in \neconomic  development,  including  by  diversifying the  economy  away  from  natural resource \nexploitation  and  remittances-led  consumption.  The  program  is  closely  aligned  with  the \nSustainable Development Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2018\u201320401 and ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy with the Kyrgyz Republic.2 It is included in ADB\u2019s country operations and \nbusiness plan, 2018\u20132020 for the Kyrgyz Republic.3 \n \n3.  The reform program will achieve broad-based economic growth. The reform areas are (i) \ntrade and investment competitiveness, (ii) SME development, (iii) infrastructure development, and \n(iv) skills development required by industry. The proposed program amount of $60 million will be \nfinanced in two subprograms of $30 million each, one in November 2019 and the other in \nNovember 2021, from the Asian Development Fund. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help the government undertake diagnostics \nin the areas of program scope; identify key policy, institutional, and process-related reforms and/or \ninterventions; and design their implementation plan. The TA will help identify and implement \npolicy, institutional, and related measures to support broad-based economic growth underpinned \nby  increased  trade  and  investment  competitiveness,  SME  development,  infrastructure \ndevelopment, and skills development required by industry. It will ensure that the proposed \nprogram advances the reforms made under the Investment Climate Improvement Programs in \nKyrgyz Republic.4 TA consultants will prepare the program, focusing on subprogram 1 to ensure \n                                                \n1  Government of Kyrgyz Republic. 2018.

Based on these \nassessments, the consultants will identify financial and nonfinancial (policy, institutional, process-\nrelated)  interventions  necessary  to  improve  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  trade  and  investment \nenvironment, and develop a 3-year action plan to implement these reforms. \n \n6.

The consultants will review the \npublic investment pipeline of the national government and regional governments to identify \ndemonstration projects; undertake preliminary technical, financial, economic, legal, institutional, \nsocial,  and  environmental  due  diligence  (including  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguards \nrequirement) of three to four projects; and prepare project briefs with an overall assessment of \nthe viability of PPP structuring.
