At the request of the Government of Azerbaijan, technical assistance (TA) for capacity \nbuilding at the Ministry of Economic Development (MOED) was included in the 2002 non-\nlending program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Azerbaijan.1 However, the TA was \nnot fully processed in 2002, because the Government did not find its initial design sufficiently \nattractive, whereas ADB could not accept the alternative design proposed by the Government. \n \n2.  When the 2003 Country Programming Mission visited Azerbaijan in May 2003, the \nGovernment requested that ADB give priority to this TA and expedite its preparation. It was \nagreed that the TA would be scheduled for approval in 2004 and that ADB and MOED staff \nwould collaborate closely during the rest of 2003 to work out a TA design that would be \nattractive  to  the  Government  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  September  2003,  ADB  sent  a \nreconnaissance mission to Azerbaijan, which agreed with the Government on key features of \nthe TA, including its purpose and methodology. This was followed by a fact-finding mission, \nwhich visited Azerbaijan in December 2003 and reached an understanding with the Government \non details of the TA, including outputs, key activities, inputs, cost estimates, financing plan, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants.  The  TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Azerbaijan  is  at  an  early  stage  of  a  major  resource  boom.  Several  large-scale \ninvestment  projects  have  recently  been  launched  in  its  oil  sector.2  Following  the  planned \ncompletion of these projects in 2005\u20132007, oil production and exports are expected to expand \nrapidly, with the extraction of crude oil almost quadrupling during 2005\u20132010. This will provide a \nsubstantial windfall to the country and ensure that economic growth, which averaged about 10% \nover the last  6 years, will remain buoyant at least through the end of this decade. \n \n4.  However, this hydrocarbon-driven economic expansion will have only a limited direct \nimpact on poverty reduction, because it will not generate many new jobs and most oil revenues \nwill accrue to state coffers and international oil companies developing Azerbaijan's oil fields. \nFurthermore,  like  any  resource  boom  involving  large  inflows  of  foreign  exchange  into  the \ndomestic economy, the oil boom in Azerbaijan will complicate macroeconomic management and \nis likely to cause appreciation of the real exchange rate and \"crowding out\" of the non-oil \ntradables  sector  by  the  oil  sector  and  the  nontradables  sector  over  the  medium  term,  a \nphenomenon known as the \"Dutch disease.\" The boom may also lead to unproductive public \nexpenditures and rapid accumulation of external debt, as happened in many other resource-rich \ncountries. In the long term, economic growth driven by the oil sector will not be sustainable, \nbecause, unless new fields are discovered, the oil boom in Azerbaijan is expected to be \nrelatively short-lived. \n \n5.  Hence,  despite  bright  medium-term  growth  prospects,  Azerbaijan  faces  formidable \neconomic  challenges.  To  avoid  the  \"resource  curse\"  experienced  by  many  other  oil-rich \ncountries, Azerbaijan needs to (i) maintain macroeconomic stability in the face of large foreign \nexchange flows related to the exploitation of hydrocarbon resources; (ii) allocate the oil windfall \nover time optimally and use it efficiently to the benefit of all segments of the population, \n                                                \n1 It first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 February 2002. \n2 The term \"oil sector\" refers to the oil and gas sector. ", "2 \nespecially the poor; and (iii) promote the development of the non-oil sector to create productive \njobs and achieve balanced and sustainable growth. \n \n6.  Overcoming  these  challenges  requires  strengthening  the  Government's  capacity  for \neconomic policy management, especially that of MOED. MOED was established in April 2001 \non the basis of five dissolved Government agencies and is responsible for key aspects of \neconomic policy management, including formulation and implementation of economic and social \ndevelopment strategy, economic policy analysis, macroeconomic forecasting, and cooperation \nwith  international  financial  institutions.  MOED  played  a  leading  role  in  the  formulation  of \nAzerbaijan's Programme on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development for 2003\u20132005 and \nthe  State  Programme  on  Socio-Economic  Development  of  Regions  for  2004\u20132008  and  is \noverseeing the implementation of these programs. To carry out its broad mandate, MOED \nneeds substantial capacity building, particularly in policy analysis and formulation of medium- \nand long-term economic and social programs. \n \n7.  Furthermore, various government agencies with economic policymaking responsibilities \nneed to improve coordination of their analytical work. Policy analyses done at MOED, Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), and National Bank of Azerbaijan Republic (NBAR) are not well coordinated \namong  these  agencies,  with  limited  exchange  of  outputs.  Consequently,  work  is  often \nduplicated, and the agencies sometimes disagree on important economic issues. This results in \ninefficient use of scarce human resources and causes undue delays in the decision-making \nprocess. \n \n8.  As part of its efforts to meet these needs, the Government is trying to strengthen the \nCenter of Economic Reforms (CER) of MOED and to develop CER into its principal economic \nthink tank providing strategic policy advice and coordinating analytical work done at various \nGovernment agencies. CER was established in 1994 on the basis of the Science and Research \nInstitute of Economy of the former State Committee of Economy and Planning. Its overall \nmandate  is  to  advance  economic  reforms.  Its  responsibilities  include  conducting  applied \neconomic  research,  monitoring  economic  and  business  developments,  providing  analytical \nsupport to MOED and other Government agencies, and helping MOED review and formulate \neconomic policies. With an annual budget of about $200,000, CER employs a total of 70 people, \nincluding 17 with graduate degrees in economics or mathematics.3 Following the appointment of \nnew management in late 2002, CER underwent a major reorganization, which enhanced its \nfocus  on  key  areas  of  economic  reforms.  CER  now  needs  to  strengthen  its  capacity  to \nundertake advanced policy analysis and help the Government formulate medium- and long-term \neconomic programs in the context of a transition economy experiencing a natural resources \nboom. \n \n9.  Recently,  CER  has  been  charged  with  developing,  in  collaboration  with  other \nGovernment agencies, models for making macroeconomic projections and analyzing the impact \nof economic policies and external shocks on the economy and poverty, which could be used in \nformulating macroeconomic and structural policies, updating the Medium-Term Expenditure \nFramework  and  the  Public  Investment  Program,  and  preparing  the  medium-term \nmacroeconomic framework for an annual budget and next national poverty reduction strategy. \nCER has started work on these models, but does not have sufficient capacity to develop them \nfully. \n \n                                                \n3  More information about CER is available at www.cer.az.  ", "    3 \n10.  Multilateral and bilateral development agencies have been providing the Government \nwith a considerable amount of TA aimed at capacity building at MOED and improving the quality \nof policy analysis at various Government agencies. ADB supported the Macroeconomic Policy \nGroup of MOF under the TA for capacity building at MOF. The IMF provided training in financial \nprogramming to the MOF and NBAR staff. The World Bank has been assisting MOED with \ncapacity building for appraisal of public investment projects. The World Bank also developed an \noil model and an RMSM-X for Azerbaijan as part of its public expenditure review process.4 The \nEuropean Union is providing TA for capacity building at MOED, which focuses on institutional \nstrengthening of the ministry. However, none of these TA projects aim to build capacity for \npolicy analysis at MOED, a key policymaking agency. Nor do any of them seek to improve \ncoordination  of  analytical  work  done  at  various  Government  agencies.  While  the  models \ndeveloped by the World Bank can be helpful in checking sustainability of prevailing economic \ntrends and feasibility of macroeconomic projections, Government officials have not been trained \nto use and maintain them. Furthermore, these models have been created using Microsoft Excel, \nwhich makes comprehending and modifying them relatively difficult. \n \n11.  Considering that support for good governance and institutional strengthening is one of \nthe three strategic thrusts of ADB's interim operational strategy for Azerbaijan, the Government \nhas requested ADB's assistance in capacity building at CER  (under MOED), particularly in \ndeveloping the models for economic policy analysis. CER staff has shown a strong interest in \nthe TA and has taken an active part in its preparation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The goal of the TA is to support the Government's efforts to create a policy environment \nconducive to broad-based, socially equitable, and sustainable economic growth. Its purpose is \nto help the Government build capacity for economic policy analysis and advice at CER. \n \n13.  The expected outputs of the TA are  \n \n(i)  models  for  making  macroeconomic  projections  and  analyzing  the  impact  of \neconomic policies and external shocks on the economy and poverty; \n \n(ii)  enhanced skills of CER staff and government officials to carry out economic \npolicy analysis; \n \n(iii)  quarterly economic reviews in Azeri and English, analyzing prevailing economic \ntrends and short- and medium-term macroeconomic projections; and \n \n(iv)  policy notes and papers on specific economic issues of particular importance to \nthe country. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.   The goal and purpose of the TA will be pursued by undertaking the following activities: \n \n                                                \n4 RMSM-X (Revised Minimum Standard Model eXtended) is a tool for economic policy analysis. ", "4 \n(i)  establish an economic modeling group (EMG), consisting of CER staff members \nand officials of MOED and other relevant government agencies; \n \n(ii)  provide training in economic modeling and policy analysis to CER staff and \ngovernment officials; \n \n(iii)  conduct economic surveys to collect the data needed for currently unavailable \neconomic modeling and policy analysis; and \n \n(iv)  build  a  partnership  between  CER  and  leading  policy  think  tanks  of  foreign \ncountries, in particular, by undertaking joint projects. \n \n15.  Officials of MOED, MOF, NBAR, State Statistics Committee, and State Oil Fund of \nAzerbaijan Republic indicated that they would join or support the EMG. To encourage them to \ndo so, CER agreed that, under the TA, the same or equivalent training opportunities would be \noffered to all group members, irrespective of the agency for which they worked.  CER also made \na commitment to preserve the EMG and maintain the economic models developed under the TA \nafter its completion. The TA is therefore expected to strengthen capacity for policy analysis at \nseveral  government  agencies  and  improve  coordination  of  analytical  work  done  at  these \nagencies.   \n \n16.  To avoid duplication and overstretching of the Government\u2019s absorptive capacity, the TA \nhas been designed in consultation with other development agencies that are providing related \ntechnical assistance to the Government. The TA takes into account lessons learned from other \ncapacity-building TAs\u2014most notably, that, for a TA to be successful and sustainable, strong \ngovernment ownership and greater focus on training of government officials are needed. The \nTA also builds on and complements other capacity-building TAs. In particular, it will harness the \nbasic oil-augmented RMSM-X of Azerbaijan and the economic database developed under the \nADB-financed TA for capacity building at MOF. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange component of $420,000 and a local currency component of $330,000 equivalent. \nADB will provide $600,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $180,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. \nThe Government will cover $150,000 equivalent of local currency cost in kind by providing \ncounterpart staff, office space, conference rooms, training facilities, and local transport. Detailed \ncost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from March 2005 to March 2007. MOED \nwill  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  with  CER  responsible  for  its  day-to-day \nimplementation. MOED will appoint a part-time project director, who will supervise the project \nimplementation on behalf of the Government and ensure timely provision of the Government's \ninputs to the project. In addition, MOED will take the lead in establishing the EMG. CER will \ncoordinate the work of the EMG and set up a team responsible for preparing and publishing \nquarterly economic reviews. ADB will make its Advance Payment Facility available to MOED, as \nneeded.  \n ", "    5 \n19.  The services of two international consultants for a total of 10 person-months and of one \ndomestic consultant (project coordinator) for 24 person-months will be required to implement the \nproject.  An  international  expert  in  economic  modeling  (5  person-months)  will  train  EMG \nmembers in economic modeling and help them develop models for economic policy analysis. An \ninternational expert in policy analysis (5 person-months) will train CER staff and government \nofficials in policy analysis and help CER prepare quarterly economic reviews. Both international \nconsultants will work intermittently, in accordance with the work plans agreed on with MOED \nand ADB at the beginning of their services. The project coordinator (24 person-months) will be \nresponsible for day-to-day management of the project under the supervision of the project \ndirector and the ADB project officer and provide administrative support to the international \nconsultants. The consultants will be engaged by ADB as individuals, in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants \nwill follow ADB's Guidelines for Procurement to purchase equipment and software. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  Outputs  of  the  TA  will  be  widely  disseminated.  In  particular,  the  economic  models \ndeveloped and the policy notes and papers prepared under the TA will be made available to all \ngovernment  agencies  with  economic  policymaking  responsibilities.  The  quarterly  economic \nreviews published by CER will be provided to government agencies free of charge and sold to \nthe public in conformity with Azerbaijan\u2019s existing legislation. Reports prepared by consultants \nengaged under the TA as well as the evaluation of its outcomes will be disseminated within the \nGovernment and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Azerbaijan for Capacity Building at the Ministry of Economic Development, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary
