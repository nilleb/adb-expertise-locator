Following the declaration of independence, Timor-Leste has been resolute in its efforts \nto institutionalize sound development management and promote improved living conditions for \nall.  In line with  these efforts,  the Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  assisting  the \nGovernment  to  build  capacity  for  good  governance.  Initiatives  are  being  put  in  place  to \nprofessionalize and strengthen the subnational units of government. These initiatives are guided \nby the understanding that a well-functioning government that is close to the people can provide \nopportunities for better program development and implementation, focused service delivery, and \nimproved  accountability  of  public  personnel.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)1  will  focus  on \ncapacity building at local government levels as shown in the TA framework (Appendix 1). It \nresponds  to  the  Government's  request  for  continued  assistance  at  the  levels  of  local \ngovernment and traditional leadership to encourage greater people participation in planning and \ndecision-making,  thus  making  the  public  administrative  system  more  responsive  and \ntransparent. During discussions, ADB and the Government reached an understanding on the \nscope, implementation arrangements, cost and financing, and outline terms of reference for the \nTA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Cognizant of the enormous capacity-building needs at the field level and the scarce \nprograms  being  implemented,  ADB  undertook  pioneering  efforts  to  assist  Timor-Leste  in \ndeveloping the managerial and technical skills required of local authorities. The initial ADB \nassistance for capacity building at the field level focused on community empowerment.2 This \nwas followed by a TA to develop critical skills that would equip East Timorese to lead the \ncountry  toward  economic  recovery  and  public  sector  management.3  To  further  assist  the \ngovernment,  another  TA  on  capacity  building  for  local  authorities4  was  processed  to  help \nconceptualize a format for local administration. Under this exercise a \"local government think \ntank\" consisting of a select group of East Timorese representing political and civil society \norganizations,  was  tasked  to  study  and  formulate  various  options  for  a  local  government \nstructure that would be appropriate for Timor-Leste.5 The TA supported the efforts of the think \ntank through workshops and a study tour. The most recent assistance, TA 3839, the first since \nthe  establishment  of  the  new  Government,  was  initiated  at  the  request  of  the  then  new \nGovernment to help develop the professional competencies of local authorities. 6   \n \n3.  Taking into account the unique situation of Timor-Leste, new nation, TA 3839 conducted \ntraining  needs  analysis  with  special  emphasis  on  a  participatory  approach.  This  involved \nworkshops  and  extensive  discussions  with  the  prospective  trainers  and  the  incumbent \nadministrators. Based on the analysis, TA 3839 also supported the development of the Capacity \nBuilding Program for Local Authorities (CPLA), which highlights a competency-based training \ncurriculum. The curriculum sets out the specifications for the intended learning outcomes and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 20 October 2003. \n2  ADB. 2000.

", "2 \ngeneral  guidelines  for  developing  the  course  content,  instructional  materials,  teaching \nmethodology, duration, and assessment methods.  \n \n4.  To ensure the relevance of the program, TA 3839 likewise developed and indigenized \nthe  training  modules  for  eight  subject  areas:7  (i)  problem  solving,  (ii)  practical  math  or \nquantitative  techniques,  (iii)  cooperating  with  others,  (iv)  communication,  (v)  managing \ninformation, (vi) leadership and management, (vii) project development and management, and \n(viii)  local  development  administration.  Each  training  module  consists  of  a  trainer\u2019s  guide, \nlesson/session plan, and course book. The modules are designed such that they can be used \nas references during training courses, and as guidebooks for trainees when carrying out their \nduties as local administrators and civil servants.  \n \n5.  The TA is ongoing and as of September 2003 had successfully trained 99 local trainers \nand public officials. TA 3839 expects to conduct about 35 training programs covering all 13 \ndistricts and six subject areas for about 600 participants that hold the positions of district \nadministrator, deputy district administrator, district development officer, district personnel officer, \neconomic  and  social  officer,  administrative  assistant,  subdistrict  administrators,  and  village \nleaders. \n \n6.  The success of the training program has been clearly evidenced on several occasions \nwhen  the  local  partners\u2014Instituto  Nacional  da  Administra\u00e7\u00e3o  P\u00fablica  (National  Institute  of \nPublic Administration) (INAP), Direc\u00e7\u00e3o National da Administra\u00e7\u00e3o Territ\u00f3rio (DNAT), and local \ngovernment administrators\u2014have openly declared their ownership of the program, its results, \nand  outputs  of  TA  3839,  which  cover  the  CPLA.  They  have  shown  commitment  to  the \nimplementation  and  success  of  the  TA.  Additionally,  other  major  stakeholders  from  the \ngovernment,  including  the  Capacity  Building  Coordination  Unit  in  the  Office  of  the  Prime \nMinister,  and  other  international  funding  agencies\u2014such  as  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID),  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID),  and  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)\u2014have  also  declared  their \nsupport for the successful implementation of the CPLA.  \n \n7.  Experience from TA 3839 underscores a number of important lessons. The most basic \nlesson  is  that  any  capacity-building  intervention  and  assistance  should  have  a  strategic \nframework for implementation that is linked to national development priorities.8 The framework \nmust be designed and formulated in close partnership and consultation with the stakeholders to \nprovide the basis for ownership of the framework and hence sustainability. Further details of the \nlessons learned are in Appendix 2. \n \n8.  Responding  to  these  findings,  significant  effort  has  been  made  to  initiate  capacity \nbuilding activities that use a highly participatory approach. Implementation arrangements to \nsustain capacity-building activities at the local level have also been initiated. Under the technical \nguidance of INAP and administrative supervision of DNAT, mobile assistance teams have been \nconstituted to provide district and subdistrict officers easy access to quality training, mentoring, \nand coaching. When completed, the TA is expected to significantly improve the capacity of the \nlocal administrators to cater to the needs of their constituencies.  \n \n                                                 \n7  TA 3839 is developing six modules and, the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is \ndeveloping the subject areas of communication and managing information. \n8  Under TA 3839, the CPLA provides a competency-based training curriculum as well as implementation guidelines, \nwhich build the gains so far in identifying Timor-Leste's capacity-building requirements for nation-building and \ndevelopment.  ", "    3 \n9.  Timor-Leste's administrators and the country as a whole are entering a new phase. \nCapacity-building efforts must be consolidated to ensure long-term impact and sustainability. \nThis follow-up TA for capacity building of local authorities is necessary to build upon and sustain \nthe gains of TA 3839.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  This TA will enhance the professional competencies of district and subdistrict officers, \nvillage leaders, and local trainers for efficient and responsive services to the citizens. It will also \nstrengthen the capacity of INAP as the lead government agency responsible for the professional \ntraining and career development of civil servants at the national and local levels. Furthermore, \nthe  TA  will  strengthen  the  mobile  assistance  teams  and  institutionalize  in-service  training \n(INSET) through a capacity-building network developed during the previous TA.  \n \n11.  The current TA has four components: (i) training of local authorities, (ii) training of \ntrainers, (iii) institutional support, and (iv) learning product development. \n \n12.  Component 1: Training of Local Authorities. The TA will develop the abilities of \ndistrict, and subdistrict officers, and village leaders in operational and functional skills. Local \nauthorities will continue their training in the subject areas of CPLA. \n \n13.  Component 2: Training of Trainers. The local pool of trainers will be trained in aspects \nof  training  development  and  management,  including  the  provision  of  support  for  the \ninstitutionalization of INSET for local authorities. As such, the TA will enhance the technical \nknow-how and skills of trainers from DNAT, INAP, and mobile assistance teams in training \nneeds-analysis,  techniques  of  instructional  development,  developing  of  training  tests,  and \ntrainer and trainee guides, and measuring the effects of training. \n \n14.  Component 3: Institutional Support. The third component has three parts. \n \n(i)  Management  and  Administration.  The  training  management  system  for  local \nauthorities will be enhanced to develop the institutional mechanisms for quality \nplanning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of training programs and \nthe overall organizational design for managing training programs covering the 13 \ndistricts. The TA will aim to make DNAT and INAP more proficient in (i) providing \npolicy directions and priorities on INSET for local authorities; (ii) establishing and \nensuring  quality  standards  for  INSET  programs  are  adequately  met;  (iii) \nmonitoring  and  evaluating  training  programs  in  relation  to  on  the  job \nperformance; (iv) updating and improving the CPLA (curriculum, training courses, \nand modules); and (v) planning and designing future INSET programs.  \n \n(ii)  Personnel  Information  System.  The  TA  will  support  the (i)  development  and \nimplementation of a system of accreditation of trainers and INSET providers to \nprofessionalize the design and delivery of training; and (ii) establishment of a \ndata base system for local authorities that will provide updated information about \nbasic  personnel  profile,  staff  development  needs,  and  training  programs \nattended. \n ", "4 \n(iii)  Monitoring and Evaluation. The TA will document the key responsibilities and \nidentify the required competencies of positions in DNAT and INAP, which will \nserve  as  a  useful  guide  for  on-the-job  performance  and  self-assessment. \nCurrently used methods for learning and training evaluation instruments will be \nassessed  and  improved,  if  necessary.  The  impact  evaluation  framework \ndeveloped under the previous TA will be used to track progress and preliminary \noutcomes of training programs. \n \n(iv)  Equipment and Materials. The TA will provide training equipment and references \nfor the districts (e.g., computers, multimedia equipment and overhead projectors, \ninstructional videos and CDs, guidebooks, etc). \n \n15.  Component 4: Learning Product Development. The component will focus on the \nupdating,  improvement,  publication,  and  dissemination  of  the  seven  training  modules.  The \nmodules will be revised to take into account implementation experience (necessary adjustments \nin the content, approach, examples, exercises, timing, and schedule will be made). Selected \npractices in local governments in Timor-Leste will be identified, documented, and incorporated \nin the revised modules. The module on managing information will also be developed. All the \nmodules  will  include  sections  on  the  training  curriculum  and  table  of  competencies  and \nprofessional standards.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  This TA will adopt the competency and research based curriculum for local authorities \ndeveloped under TA 3839 to ensure realization of desired learning outcomes and proficiencies. \nCapacity-building programs for district and subdistrict officers, village leaders, and trainers will \nbe interfaced to have the optimum effect. Training programs will, in so far as be practicable, \nlocally-based and interactive. Target beneficiaries will be actively involved in assessing their \nown learning progress, evaluating the training programs, and recommending improvements.  \n \n17.  Overall management and administration of training programs will be centrally supported \n(by DNAT), centrally-guided (by INAP), locally managed (by the local authorities), implemented \non-site at the field level, and (whenever necessary) aided by the mobile assistance teams. \nDNAT will provide policy support and guidelines to ensure the effective implementation of the \ntraining programs. It will assure that local authorities actively participate in and contribute to the \nsuccess  of  the  capacity-building  program.  DNAT,  in  collaboration  with  INAP,  will  likewise \nmonitor and evaluate training outcomes.  \n \n18.  Actual  implementation  of  training programs  will  be  a shared  responsibility  of  INAP, \nmobile assistance teams, and local authorities. They will establish and enforce quality standards \nfor all training programs conducted. Training certificates will be awarded only to participants who \nhave satisfactorily met the requirements. The quality of training will be closely monitored and \nfeedback will be used for review of strategies, effectiveness, and improvement in the delivery \nsystem.  The  process  will  be  participatory  and  continuing.  New  practices  learned  in  the \nimplementation of training programs for local authorities will be fully documented and used in \nadjusting the delivery of interventions and the design and conduct of forthcoming programs.  \n \n19.  The local languages will be used in the delivery of training programs as appropriate. \nTraining modules are likewise translated.   \n ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $687,000 equivalent, which comprises a foreign exchange \ncost  of  $256,000  and  local  currency  cost  of  $431,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $550,000 covering the entire foreign exchange cost and a local \ncurrency cost of $294,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will contribute the remaining local currency cost of $137,000 \nequivalent to cover the office accommodation, counterpart support, some field transport, facility \nfor workshops and training venues and other administrative costs. Details of the cost estimates \nand the financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  DNAT will be the Executing Agency and INAP the Implementing Agency of the TA. INAP \nwill be responsible for overall coordination with ADB. DNAT and INAP will assure that adequate \nsupport is provided for a small team of consultants, in terms of access to relevant information, \noffice space and facilities, and (where possible) transportation. The consultants will become the \nnew members of the working group established under TA 3839 and will be working closely with \nDNAT and INAP.  \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months commencing in May 2004 and ending in \nNovember  2005.  The  consulting  services  for  the  TA  will  include  14  person-months  of \ninternational and 16 person-months of domestic consultancy. All consultants will be engaged as \nindividual consultants by ADB, in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Technical  and \nadministrative  support  will  be  provided  by  the  Government  to  the  consultants  through  the \nengagement of appropriately qualified support personnel as needed. The training equipment \nand materials necessary will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n23.  The reporting requirements for the consultants will include (i) an inception report, within \n4  weeks  of  TA  commencement;  (ii)  progress  reports,  after  each  field  visit;  (iii)  interim \naccomplishment reports; (iv) a draft final report, at least 1 month prior to TA completion; and (v) \na  final  report  summarizing  the  outputs  with  appropriately  documented  listing  of  the \nachievements. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for Capacity Building to Strengthen \nPublic Sector Management and Governance Skills (Phase II), and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board.  \n \n ", "6

Lessons Learned \n \n1.  Implementation of technical assistance (TA) 3839 underscores a number of important \nlessons. The first and the most basic lesson is that any capacity-building intervention should \nhave a strategic framework for implementation that is linked to national development priorities. \nFurther, the framework must be designed and formulated in close partnership and consultation \nwith  the  stakeholders  to  provide  the  basis  for  ownership  of  the  framework  and,  hence, \nsustainability.  \n \n2.  The second lesson is that the process of capacity building cannot, and should not, be \nfast-tracked. Capacity building is a continuing process and it necessarily takes time. It cannot be \na one-shot deal imposed from above by the central authorities, or, worse, by any external \nagency. It is important to invest time and resources in (i) developing local ownership of the \nprogram, (ii) establishing alliances and partnerships with institutions, (iii) creating a critical mass \nof champions among key stakeholders at national and local levels, and (iv) ensuring that the \nprogram  is  institutionalized  to  guarantee  its  sustainability.  This  inclusive  process  lays  the \ngroundwork  for  ownership  of  the  capacity-building  intervention  and  strategies  and  hence \nincreases the chances of institutionalizing human resource development efforts and eventually \nthe success of the capacity building intervention. \n \n3.  Third, a capacity-building program should always be designed within the context of \nbuilding or strengthening a nation, with the primary focus on good governance and improved \nservice delivery.
