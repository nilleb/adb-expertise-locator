The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has included in its country program for 2003 a loan \nfor  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Environmental  Improvement  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  The  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA)1 for the proposed loan was approved in November \n2001, and the consultants were fielded in May 2002. During the review mission for the PPTA in \nSeptember 2002, the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) requested that, at completion of \nthe PPTA, ADB would provide additional technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the managerial \nand  institutional  capabilities  of  the  state  government  and  the  municipal  governments  to \nefficiently manage the activities under the proposed ADB loan. In the past, implementation of \nurban projects experienced substantial delays due to the weak management capacity of the \nstates and participating municipalities.  Based on these lessons learned, a follow-up Mission \nvisited Bhopal from 14 to 17 December 2002 to discuss the objectives and scope of the TA and \nreached an understanding with GOMP on the consultants\u2019 terms of reference as well as the \nimplementation arrangements.2  The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n2.  Urbanization  in  India  was  the  main  driving  force  for  the  faster  economic  growth \nexperienced during the 1990s.  Estimates of the contribution of urban areas to gross domestic \nproduct are in the order of 55-60%, well above the level of urbanization (28% in 2001).  \nEconomic growth is thus highly dependant on the fortunes of urban areas and their ability to \nattract investment and increase productivity. However, despite the contribution to economic \ngrowth by the urban sector, successive 5-year plans of the Government of India stressed rural \ndevelopment in general and neglected balanced urban development. It was not until the time of \nthe  Eighth  Plan  (1993-1997)  that  the  role  and  importance  of  urban  sector  was  explicitly \nrecognized. \n \n3.  The momentum for urban sector reform was provided in 1992 with the passing of the \n74th Constitutional Amendment (CA). The Amendment was intended to create a democratic \ngovernance structure, with local responsibilities being assumed and managed at the local level. \nIt  was  to  address  the  inadequacies  of  the  existing  system  of  municipalities,  redefine  the \nrelationship between the state governments and municipal governments, and lay the foundation \nfor a new approach to urban management and governance that could fulfill the needs and \naspiration of urban residents for development.   \n \n4.  However, actual implementation of the Amendment has been a very slow process. While \nthe functions and responsibilities of the local bodies have been increased substantially, no \nimprovement  has  been  seen  in  their  institutional  and  financial  capacities.  Municipal \ngovernments, especially in small and medium towns, lack professionally qualified technical staff \nin critical areas of municipal management. Also, the financial resources available to the local \nbodies are grossly inadequate to enable them to undertake the required urban programs. For \nthese reasons, until such time comes when local bodies become creditworthy and professionally \nmanaged entities, the dominance of the state over local matters is likely to continue. On the \nother hand, institutional transformation will be much faster if the central and state governments \nmake genuine efforts to devolve the necessary power and financial resources to match the \nnewly assigned functions of local governments. Therefore, concerted endeavors for capacity \nbuilding need to be an integral part of the urban development strategy.  \n                                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to India for Integrated Urban Development in Madhya Pradesh. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet) on 24 January 2003.  ", "2   \n \n5.  In support of the new emphasis on urban development by the Government, ADB has \napproved seven projects in the urban sector totaling $1.58 billion since 1995. Of the seven, \nthree involved lending to financial institutions at the national level for onlending to eligible \nborrowers in the housing and commercial urban infrastructure sectors. The remaining four \ninvolved lending to selected state and local governments for integrated urban development to \nimprove urban governance and infrastructure.3 However, the performance of integrated urban \ndevelopment projects was not fully satisfactory, and some important lessons emerged during \nproject implementation. The major issues confronting the management of the urban sector \nprojects are as follows: \n \n(i)  Start-up  delays  have  been  significant;  the  problem  of  an  unduly  optimistic \nimplementation  schedule  needs  to  be  squarely  recognized,  and  the \nimplementation risks related to a variety of factors, including scale, complexity, \nlack  of  institutional  absorptive  capacity,  land  acquisition,  lengthy  review \nprocedures, and procurement problems, need to be fully analyzed during the \npreparation of the project; advance action (especially for recruitment of project \nmanagement and design consultants and prequalification of contractors) will \nhave to be undertaken to the full extent to avoid the otherwise anticipated delays \nin implementation. \n \n(ii)  Inadequate institutional analysis during project preparation tends to result in \nunduly optimistic institutional objectives; for instance, loan financial covenants \nare often too ambitious about the possibility of increasing user charges and \nachieving cost recovery; furthermore, ADB projects tend to overestimate the \nborrower's capacity and fail to understand the nature of intergovernmental and \ninteragency relationships; PPTA will have to provide an accurate assessment of \nthe financial and managerial capacities  of the participating municipalities; the \nsize of the investment in each city will be determined only after full analysis of the \nabsorptive capacities of the participating municipalities. \n \n(iii)  Past experience clearly shows that neither the municipalities nor ADB have the \ncapacity to manage integrated projects with hundreds of small schemes; the \nnumber  of  procurement  packages  under  the  project  will  be  minimized  by \ncombining  the  small  packages  into  one  contract  that  will  also  attract  more \nqualified contractors. \n \n(iv)  ADB needs to be more cautious in planning the involvement of nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  in  ADB  projects,  since  the  number  of  legitimate  and \ncapable NGOs is few.  \n \n(v)  Implementation  of  slum  improvement  and  poverty  reduction  components  is \nextremely time-intensive and requires careful planning and monitoring. \n \n                                                                 \n3  ADB. 1995.

Manila \n ", "       3\n6.  Recognizing the need to improve the performance of the existing urban projects, ADB \nundertook a  review of its urban sector operations in India. The review found that up-front \ncapacity building is essential to achieving the physical and institutional targets of urban projects. \nWhile the standard practice in ADB is the provision of capacity-building assistance with the \napproval of a loan project, the lessons learned clearly indicate the need to strengthen the \nmanagement and institutional capabilities of the state governments and local governments prior \nto loan effectiveness, particularly for those that are new to ADB-sponsored urban projects.  \n \n7.  To ensure the success of up-front capacity building, however, the state governments \nand local governments must put in place dedicated counterpart staff units.  This institutional \narrangement is crucial, as even if there are changes in personnel later, some of the experience \nand learning will be retained and trickle down. In fact, GOMP agreed that a project management \ncell would be set up within the Urban Administration and Development Department (UADD) to \nundertake preparatory activities for project management and institutional reform. The early \nestablishment of the project cell is considered essential so that the appointed staff can directly \ninteract with the TA consultants and carry forward the project preparatory work through the \nformal  establishment  of  a  project  management  unit  after  loan  effectiveness.  As  per  the \nagreement,  GOMP  will  appoint  two  full-time  senior-level  officers  to  head  the  project  cell, \nsupported by an adequate number of supporting staff.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The objective of the TA is to strengthen the managerial and institutional capabilities of \nthe state government and six municipal governments4 to efficiently and effectively manage, \ncoordinate, and monitor the urban infrastructure and governance improvement initiatives under \nthe proposed ADB loan. Particular emphasis will be given to the improvement of project \nmanagement capacity by (i) helping develop an adequate managerial structure to undertake the \nnew initiatives within each of the six municipalities, (ii) assisting in the development of a \nsupervisory system within UADD, (iii) helping ensure that state and municipal government staff \nfamiliarize  themselves  with  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  and  (iv)  improving  coordination \nbetween the state government and the participating municipalities. The TA will also help UADD \nand the project municipalities initiate a stakeholder consultation process and identify NGOs and \ncommunity groups to be responsible for the various social components5 of the ensuing project.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will concentrate on improving the project management capacity of the state and \nparticipating municipalities. Many of the TA activities will serve as an example for strengthening \nthe overall institutional capabilities of all local governments in Madhya Pradesh. The TA will \nhave the following main components: \n \n(i)  Managerial  structure.  To  equip  the  state  government  and  the  municipal \ngovernments with qualified staff and a clear mandate, the TA will develop an \noptimal  managerial  and  personnel  structure  supported  by  detailed  terms  of \n                                                                 \n4 Indore, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Ujjain, Ratlam, and Gwalior. \n5 E.g., community mobilization, dissemination activities, consultations with primary stakeholders about location and \ndesign of community facilities, and resettlement implementation \n   ", "4   \nreference for the key personnel. The TA will help the municipalities define a clear \nrole for themselves in undertaking the activities under the proposed ADB loan. The \nTA will strengthen the supervisory capacity of UADD in monitoring the activities of \nthe municipalities. \n \n(ii)  Familiarization with ADB procedures. The TA will assist the state government \nand the municipal governments in familiarizing themselves with ADB\u2019s policies and \nprocedures for social and environmental safety guards, procurement, recruitment \nof consultants, etc. \n \n(iii)  Training. The TA will help train state and municipal government personnel in \nplanning, management, and coordination of project activities through participatory \nworkshops  as  well  as  on-the-job  involvement  in  project  management.    Key \npersonnel to be responsible for project management will be identified for intensive \non-the-job training during TA implementation. The performance of the selected \nproject management staff will be monitored for replacement if necessary. For \nparticipatory  workshops  and  on-the-job  training,  the  TA  will  develop  course \nmodules, materials, and manuals to be used by project implementation staff. \n \n(iv)  Public awareness program. To involve the beneficiaries in project implementation \nthrough a participatory approach and cooperation, the TA will design and initiate \nthe activities for conducting a public awareness program. The TA will also guide \nand  assist  the  state  and  municipal  government  personnel  in  the  design  and \nimplementation of the broad social components. \n \n(v)  Stakeholder  consultation.  The  TA  will  build  up  the  stakeholder  consultation \nprocess at the municipal, ward, and community levels and identify the role of \ncommunity-based organizations, self-help groups, and other line agencies that will \nbe responsible for the implementation of various social components of the project. \nThe TA will also design programs for NGO and community-based organization \ninvolvement  in  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  services  to  the  low-income \ncommunities  for  financing  under  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction.  The \nlessons learned from past experience, especially concerning the engagement of \nNGOs for municipal service delivery, will be fully incorporated in designing the new \nproject.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $654,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $129,000 and local currency cost of $525,000 equivalent. ADB will provide \n$520,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $391,000 equivalent in \nlocal currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe  Government  has  given  its  assurance that, when the TA begins, it will contribute the \nremaining local currency cost of $134,000 equivalent for office accommodation, counterpart \nstaff support, field transport, facilities for seminars and meetings, and other administrative \nexpenses. The Government will also provide all information required for the TA activities. Details \nof the cost estimate and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \n \n \n ", "       5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  UADD will be Executing Agency for the TA, through the Project Cell established during \nthe implementation of the PPTA, and will be responsible for overall coordination with ADB. It will \nalso provide full administrative and technical support to the consultants and will coordinate all \nproject activities with the project municipalities. UADD will provide adequate office space for the \nconsultants with sufficient communication means. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months from April to November 2003. The consulting \nservices for the TA will total 32 person-months (pm): 4 pm international and 28 pm domestic, \nexcluding  the  inputs  of  local  institutions  to  assist  community  mobilization  and  a  public \nawareness campaign for water conservation. All consultants will be engaged on an individual \nbasis  by  ADB,  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The expertise required for \nconsulting services is as follows: project management expert and team leader (international, 4 \npm), procurement specialist (domestic, 8 pm), community development specialist (domestic, 8 \npm),  water  supply  and  sanitation  engineer  (domestic,  8  pm),  and  public  relations  expert \n(domestic, 4 pm). Technical support will be provided to international and domestic experts \nthrough the engagement of technical and administrative assistants as required.  The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n13.  The consultants\u2019 reporting requirements will include (i) an inception report within 3 weeks \nof  TA  commencement,  (ii)  monthly  progress  reports  at  the  end  of  each  month  during \nimplementation, and (iii) a final report summarizing the achievements of the TA. In the course of \nTA implementation, the consultants will organize training programs and workshops in Bhopal \nand other project municipalities.    \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $520,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  India  for  Capacity  Building  for  Project  Management  and  Community \nMobilization in Madhya Pradesh and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n   ", "6  Appendix 1     \n   \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n  Indicators and  Monitoring   \nNarrative Summary  Targets  Mechanisms  Key Assumptions \n       \nGoal       \n       \nSuccessful implementation of  For the project to  ADB\u2019s loan  Project cell will be fully \nthe Urban Water Supply and  maintain a satisfactory  review missions  operational before the fielding \nEnvironmental Improvement  or highly satisfactory    of the TA consultants. \nProject in Madhya Pradesh  rating in the project  Project \n  performance report for  performance \nboth implementation  reports \nprogress and the   \nachievement of  Project \ndevelopment  completion \nobjectives during its  report \nimplementation \n \n       \nPurpose       \n       \nTo avoid unnecessary delay in  Timely implementation  ADB\u2019s loan  A strong sense of ownership \nproject implementation caused  of the project based on  review missions  by the state and municipal \nby poor institutional and  the original    governments \nmanagerial capacities of the  implementation  Project \nproject management staff in  schedule  performance \nstate and municipal    reports \ngovernments     \n  Project \n  completion \n  report \n   \n       \nComponents/Outputs       \n       \n1.
