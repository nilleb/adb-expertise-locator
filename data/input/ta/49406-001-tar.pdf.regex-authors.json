INTRODUCTION \n1.  Based  on  the  midterm  review  of  the  long-term  strategic  framework  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), Strategy 2020, ADB aims to incorporate global best practices in its \nvarious engagements.1 Procurement is a critical area that influences ability of the executing \nagencies to spend project funds effectively and efficiently. ADB\u2019s developing member countries \n(DMCs) are benefiting from the improvements already made by its mainstreaming of the 10-\npoint action plan. These actions were implemented starting August 2014, and have since helped \nimprove internal efficiency and cost effectiveness in ADB\u2019s internal procurement processes. \n \n2.  ADB recognizes that  its current one-size-fits-all procurement approach needs to be \nreviewed and updated. DMCs need a procurement approach that will allow them to respond to \ntheir changing needs, reflect the growing strengths and range of executing agency capabilities, \nand better account for wide range of capacities of procuring entities involved in its various \nprojects. This will help DMCs adopt and incorporate the new public procurement concepts and \nmethods increasingly used worldwide. \n \n3.  This policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) will enable ADB to support DMCs in \nstrengthening their procurement systems by developing and adopting a new ADB procurement \nframework  to  be  applied  under  its  financed  transactions  and  administered  projects.  The \nframework will be based on a comprehensive examination of the procurement and consultant \nselection  policies  that  currently  apply.  It  will  incorporate  the  emerging  best  practices  and \ninnovations in public procurement. The new framework will also help ADB support DMCs in \nspeeding  up  the  disbursement  of  project  funds.  It  will  therefore  help  strengthen  country \nprocurement systems by encouraging the use of alternative procurement arrangements in ADB-\nfinanced transactions and its administered projects.  The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  A significant portion of ADB\u2019s financing to DMCs flow through government procurement \nsystems.  As public expenditures rapidly grow, contracting is becoming strategically important.   \nBorrowers are now demanding procurement tools that go beyond compliance monitoring of \ninputs. Governments globally are making efforts to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in the \nuse of public funds. Stronger procurement systems are needed to ensure that governments \ndeliver value for money and that risks are well managed throughout the project cycle. \n \n5.  Rapid globalization has resulted in a transformation of the markets that DMCs use to \nprocure goods, works, and services.  In parallel, new international instruments and agreements \nhave  created  greater  demand  for  open  and  transparent  procurement.    These  include  the \nAgreement on Government Procurement of the World Trade Organization,3 the Model Law on \nPublic Procurement by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law,4 and the \n                                                           \n1 ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 December 2015. \n3 World Trade Organization. https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gp_gpa_e.htm \n4 United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. https://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/procurem/ml-\nprocurement-2011/2011-Model-Law-on-Public-Procurement-e.pdf \n ", "2   \n \nEuropean Union\u2019s Directives on Public Procurement.5  The use of technology, especially e-\nprocurement, is changing the way public procurement is executed. \n \n6.  In addition, developing country demand for greater use of their country procurement \nsystems has been growing in projects funded by development partners.6   These governments \nalso want development partners to agree to the use of harmonized procurement procedures. \nGoods, works, and services under ADB-financed operations are governed by procurement and \nconsultant selection policies that aim to promote open and fair competition. They have been \nvetted continually through a strict harmonization process with other multilateral development \nbanks (MDBs) and adapted to changes in DMC demand and in ADB\u2019s operations.  \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s DMCs have often blamed delays in MDB-supported projects due to cumbersome \nprocurement  requirements  and  compliance-driven  procedures.  As  these  countries  evolve \neconomically, they want their development partners to focus on building country procurement \ncapacity  and  improve  country  procurement  policies.    There  is  also  increasing  demand for \ngreater flexibility and responsiveness in development partners procurement rules.  \n \n8.  The World Bank responded to these demands by approving a comprehensive reform of \nits procurement policy in 2015.7 The new World Bank policy adopts a broader range of modern \nprocurement methods based on value for money and fit for purpose. The new framework will be \nimplemented during 2016 and upon assessment of World Bank\u2019s institutional readiness to make \nthe transition. The policy revisions also address the World Bank\u2019s new organization structure \ninstitutionalized  in  2014,  and  its  need  to  operate  in  a  wide  variety  of  sectors  beyond \ninfrastructure.  \n \n9.  The African Development Bank is also in the process of implementing the full use of \nacceptable country procurement systems for simple contracts.  African Development Bank \nprocedures will be used for complex contracts.  Other MDBs, including the Inter-American \nDevelopment  Bank  and  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  have \ncommitted to fully exploring ways to make their procurement policies more flexible in response \nto client demands. \n \n10.  ADB has progressively moved towards decentralization and delegation of procurement \nauthority and decisions to regional departments.  However, implementation is hampered due to \nrisk avoidance and excessive focus on procedural compliance.  ADB also faces challenges and \nresource  constraints  in  overseeing  procurement  in  DMCs  that  lack  capacity  to  apply  the \nprocedures imposed by its current guidelines. Borrowers and ADB staff often find the procedural \nprovisions too complex, prescriptive, and time-consuming to implement. \n \n11.  DMCs have requested ADB to update its procurement and consultant selection policies \nto  ensure  that  these  policies  continue  to  serve  their  evolving  development  needs.  These \nupdates will also be important to ADB\u2019s effort to modernize its procurement and consultant \nselection rules and regulations in ways that will enhance support for the use of country systems, \n                                                           \n5  European Commission. 2015. http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/eu_public_directives_en.htm \n6  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2005.

THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  will  be  the  enhanced  effectiveness  of  DMC  spending  in  ADB-financed \nprojects that adoption of a modern principle-based procurement framework will help bring about. \nThe outcome will be improved quality of DMC procurement decision making leading to better \noperational efficiency and higher transparency. The key outputs are (i) procurement framework \n(covering proposal for improvement to existing procurement and consultant selection policies \nand procedures) designed to benefit and strengthen DMC current and emerging development \nneeds developed, (ii) use of alternative DMC procurement arrangements for ADB financed \nprojects increased, and (iii) capacity enhancement initiatives to support implementation of new \nprocurement policy and procedures developed.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The new framework will be developed based on the review and experience of the \nexisting  procurement  policy  and  procedures,  and  in  consultation  with  various  internal  and \nexternal stakeholders. This will be supported by developing a new procurement and consultant \nselection  policy,  applicable  procedures  (including  mainstreaming  e-procurement  to  improve \nprocess efficiency), and guidance notes for the DMC (and ADB staff) to apply them. \n \n14.  A risk\u2212based methodology for assessment of borrower procurement systems, and their \nacceptance as alternative procurement arrangements will be developed. This will be piloted in \n2\u22123 DMCs selected based on ADB\u2019s experience in using national procurement procedures in \nvarious countries. \n \n15.  ADB will also increase focus on building capacities of executing agencies to provide \nappropriate fiduciary comfort and implement the project procurement in the most time\u2212efficient \nand cost\u2212effective manner possible.  \n \n16.   The risks of change management have to be mitigated through upgrading skill gaps \nwithin DMCs, executing agencies as well as ADB staff.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V).  The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  December  2015  to  December  2018.    ADB\u2019s \nOperations  Services  and  Financial  Management  Department  will  play  the  principal  role  in \nadministration and supervision of this TA.  \n \n ", "4   \n \n19.   The TA will require an estimated 20 person-months of services from seven international \nconsultants and 50 person-months of services from five national consultants. When needed, \nsupport will be obtained from other experts.  \n \n20.    The TA work will include a review of ADB\u2019s past and current procurement policy-related \ninitiatives. ADB has already developed a concept note for the planned procurement policy \nreview and carried out initial internal consultations.  \n \n21.  Once the framework is developed, additional consultations may be required to ensure \nthat it is robust, aligned with global best practices, and takes into account ADB\u2019s changing \nbusiness landscape without compromising ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements. These requirements \nare detailed in the concept note.8   \n \n22.   TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nEnhancing Procurement Performance of Developing Member Countries in ADB Projects, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                           \n8 ADB. 2015.

Three  Consultants  to  Support  Development  of  New  ADB  Procurement  Policy \nFramework \n \n1.  Activities  under  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  and  advisory  technical \nassistance (TA) for Enhancing Procurement Performance of Developing Member Countries in \nADB  Projects  will  include  (i)  the  drafting  of  a  new  ADB  procurement  framework,  (ii) \nbenchmarking  of  procurement  practices  of  other  multilateral  development  banks,  (iii) \nprocurement skills analysis, (iv) the drafting of procurement policies and procedures, and (v) \npreparation of guidance notes for new procurement areas.   \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s review of its current procurement policy is expected to result in development of \nthe new procurement framework under this TA. This framework will have six key elements: (i) a \nprinciple-based modern procurement policy, (ii) flexible procurement methods, (iii) technology-\nenabled  efficient  procurement  processes,  (iv)  systematic  capacity  building  of  executing \nagencies,  (v)  ADB\u2019s  acceptance  of  well-functioning  borrower  procurement  systems  for  its \nprojects, and (vi) training of ADB staff for better procurement decision making and support. \n \n3.  To help in the design of the new procurement framework, ADB\u2019s Operations Services \nand  Financial  Management  Department  (OSFMD)  will  hire  national  and  international \nconsultants.  The  scope  of  work  planned  includes  a  review  of  ADB\u2019s  past  and  current \nprocurement policy-related initiatives, including those carried out under the Midterm Review of \nStrategy  2020  Action  Plan.  This  will  be  done  to  gain  a  full  understanding  of  the  current \nprocurement policy and how it is being implemented and thereby help in the development of the \nnew framework. OSFMD has developed a concept note for the planned procurement policy \nreview and carried out initial internal consultations. Further consultations may be required to \nensure that the framework developed is robust, in line with global best practices, and takes into \naccount  the  changing  business  landscape  of  ADB  without  compromising  the  fiduciary \nrequirements.  This has been discussed in detail in the concept note. \n \n4.  The three consultants will  \n(i)  review past and current procurement policy-related initiatives within ADB; \n(ii)  review current procurement bottlenecks related to procurement efficiency and \neffectiveness in ADB operations; \n(iii)  recommend a new procurement policy framework based on the six elements \ndescribed  in  para.  2  and  in  line  with  international  best  practices  in  public \nprocurement, including those with which other multilateral development banks \nhave experience; \n(iv)  make recommendations on changing ADB\u2019s current procurement organizational \nstructure to meet ADB business requirements effectively and efficiently; \n(v)  assess potential fiduciary risks in transitioning to the new framework and develop \nmitigation measures; \n(vi)  participate in discussions with OSFMD management to prioritize implementation \nof the new framework; \n(vii)  provide inputs and peer review of the new policy and procedures, borrower and \nstaff capacity development programs, and monitoring arrangements, emerging \nareas  like  procurement  of  innovative  technologies  and  others  as  may  be \nrequired; \n ", "Appendix 3          9 \n(viii)  support the preparation of user guides, new standard bidding documents and \ncontracts  forms,  bid  evaluation  guides,  training  materials,  and  e-learning  for \nProcurement Accreditation Skills Scheme; and \n(ix)  support  consultations  with  key  engineering  associations  and  contractor \nassociations \n \n5.        These consultants must have the following minimum qualifications:  \n(i)  a bachelor\u2019s degree (a  master\u2019s degree is preferred);  \n(ii)  strong  work  experience  in  project  management  and  procurement,  preferably \ngained  working  with  a  host  of  private  sector,  government  institutions,  and \nmultilateral development agency-financed projects;   \n(iii)  strong analytical understanding of issues, challenges, and opportunities related \nto procurement reforms; and  \n(iv)  demonstrated knowledge  of  and  experience  in  analysis  and  interpretation of \nprocurement-related quantitative and qualitative information. \n \nB.  Two  International  Consultants  to  Support  Use  of  Alternative  Procurement \nSystems \n \n6.  The  consultants\u2019  work  will  include  developing  a  methodology  and  guidance  for \nevaluating  and  using  alternative  procurement  systems  in  ADB-financed  projects.  The \nconsultants will also help prepare guidance for assessing procurement systems for results-\nbased lending operations. This work will involve a review of similar past and current initiatives \nfor  use  of  country  systems  by  other  entities,  and  understanding  of  best  practices.  The \nconsultants will also serve as peer reviewers when needed for the ongoing procurement policy \ndevelopment work.  \n \n7.  The tasks include:  \n(i)  review of the past and current initiatives within ADB; \n(ii)  review initiatives by other MDBs and their experience in implementing country \nsystems; \n(iii)   recommend a robust methodology and provide suitable guidance for ADB to use \nalternative procurement arrangements; \n(iv)   define the criteria based on which such arrangements can be assessed and \ndeemed acceptable by ADB or another development partner; \n(v)  recommend a methodology for procurement under ADB-financed results-based \nlending, including lessons learned from other MDBs and identifying operations \nmost suited for results-based procurement arrangements; and   \n(vi)  provide inputs and peer review of the new policy and procedures, borrower and \nstaff capacity development programs, and monitoring arrangements as required. \n \n8.        These consultants must have the following minimum qualifications:   \n(i)  a bachelor\u2019s degree (a master\u2019s degree is preferred);  \n(ii)  strong  work  experience  in  project  management  and  procurement,  preferably \ngained working with the private sector, government institutions, and multilateral \ndevelopment agency-financed projects;  \n(iii)  strong analytical understanding of issues, challenges, and opportunities related \nto procurement reforms; and  \n(iv)  demonstrated knowledge  of  and  experience  in  analysis  and  interpretation of \nprocurement-related quantitative and qualitative information. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n \nC.
