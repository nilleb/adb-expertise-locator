INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) was established in July 1999 \nat the initiative of the governments of Japan and the United Kingdom, working closely with the \nWorld Bank. This multidonor technical assistance (TA) facility was set up to assist developing \ncountries  to  improve  the  quality  of  their  infrastructure  through  private  participation  in \ninfrastructure (PPI). PPIAF helps to facilitate private sector involvement in financing, ownership, \noperation,  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  or  management  of  infrastructure  services.  Eligible \ninfrastructure services assisted by PPIAF are roads, ports, airports, railways, electricity supply, \ntelecommunications,  solid  waste,  water  supply  and  sewerage,  and  gas  transmission  and \ndistribution. \n \n2.  Through the PPIAF contribution, this TA will develop knowledge to address barriers to \nPPI in low-income countries in Asia and the Pacific. Partnering with PPIAF will not only be a \ncost-effective  way  to  support  development  activities  (thereby  benefiting  from  additional \nresources of PPIAF) but will also allow the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to gain knowledge \non developing the enabling environment for PPI in low-income countries through its involvement \nin PPIAF. The concept paper for this TA was approved on 16 November 2009 by the Vice-\nPresident  for  Knowledge  Management  and  Sustainable  Development. 1  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.    ADB estimates that investment in infrastructure must reach an estimated $4.7 trillion \nover the next 10 years to sustain growth in Asia and the Pacific.2 Therefore, countries will need \nto spend an estimated 6%\u20137% of their gross domestic products on infrastructure. However, their \nrecent public sector investment has averaged only 3%\u20134% of their gross domestic products, \nleaving a significant financing shortfall. Thus, support is needed to create the right access and \nincentives  for  PPI.  The  private  sector,  however,  is  reluctant  to  allocate  scarce  project \ndevelopment funds and capital to projects in many low-income countries because of the high-\nrisk nature of early-stage infrastructure development. These risks arise from uncertainties in \nregulatory, institutional, and political environments and include currency, credit, and market risks. \nOther barriers to PPI involve (i) lack of suitable infrastructure projects for investment, (ii) high \nup-front costs of project development, (iii) shortage of long-term debt, (iv) lack of local currency \nfunding, (v) high revenue risk, and (vi) inadequate capacity in both the public and private sectors.  \n \n4.  The mission of PPIAF is to help eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable development \nin developing countries by facilitating PPI. PPIAF pursues its mission through two mechanisms: \n(i) TA  to governments in  developing  countries  on  strategies  and measures to  tap  the full \npotential  of  PPI;  and  (ii)  identification,  dissemination,  and  promotion  of  good  practices  on \nmatters related to PPI in developing countries. The PPIAF mission resonates with ADB\u2019s aim to \nplay a catalytic role in increasing PPI for poverty reduction and economic growth in Asia and the \nPacific, as set out in ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020).3 Strategy \n2020 acknowledges that PPI will be harder to achieve in ADB\u2019s low-income developing member \ncountries (DMCs) and that further experience and knowledge is needed to enable such PPI. \nBecause of the recent financial and economic crisis, even greater effort will be required in the \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 November 2009.  \n2  ADB. 2009.

ADB joined PPIAF in 2001 by contributing an initial $250,000 to the trust fund to cover \nthe 12 months from 1 January 2001. Thereafter, ADB renewed its funding support for 8 years to \nJuly 2009. The current trust fund agreement with PPIAF has been extended to 31 October 2012 \nto allow implementation of an ongoing PPIAF-funded TA.4 The present TA for $500,000 renews \nADB\u2019s membership for 2 years from the date of signing a revision to the current trust fund \nagreement, and will permit new TA funding for projects presented by ADB to PPIAF.  \n \n6.  Contributing to PPIAF offers ADB the opportunity to support the enabling environment \nfor PPI as well as allowing ADB to benefit from both knowledge generated by PPIAF and \nfunding leveraged from other donors. ADB is a member of PPIAF Program Council, which \nincludes representatives of all contributing donor agencies, so ADB has a role in the strategic \nmanagement of PPIAF. Results from the independent strategic review of PPIAF operations \nconducted  in  2008  validated  the  relevance  of  the  facility\u2019s  core  mandate  of  supporting \ninfrastructure services through public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs).5 With strong donor support, \nPPIAF  is  a  good  example  of  a  global  partnership  working  to  catalyze  PPI.  A  key \nrecommendation of the strategic review was that regional development banks, such as ADB, be \nbetter integrated into PPIAF.  \n \n7.  ADB is a partner institution along with the World Bank Institute, the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank and the Multilateral Investment Fund in jointly developing the Multilateral \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership in Infrastructure Capacity Development Program with PPIAF funding, \nand is trying to harmonize its PPP knowledge management and dissemination activities with this \nprogram. ADB is also contributing TA funding to the Private Infrastructure Development Group \n(PIDG), a multi-donor initiative to support private sector investment in low-income countries. The \nPIDG collaborates closely with PPIAF on its annual TA work program.  \n \n8.  PPIAF  is  governed  by  the  Program  Council,  consisting  of  representatives  from \ncontributing  donors.  The  council  is  responsible  for  defining  PPIAF  policies  and  strategies, \napproving  the  indicative  annual  work  program  and  financial  plan,  and  reviewing  PPIAF \nperformance. It is also responsible for approving individual project submissions. It meets once a \nyear to review the strategic direction of the PPIAF program. The Technical Advisory Panel, \ncomposed of up to six independent experts in matters related to PPI in developing countries, \nensures the quality and relevance of PPIAF-financed activities. A Program Management Unit \n(PMU) is responsible for day-to-day management of PPIAF in pursuit of its mandate. The PMU \nreports to the Program Council at least quarterly through the council\u2019s chair\u2014the World Bank\u2019s \nvice-president for sustainable development (Appendix 2). \n \n9.  PPIAF has a two-tier financial structure comprising a core fund and noncore funds. The \ncore fund contains a pool of resources that can be used for any activity falling within the work \nprogram approved by the Program Council. The funds may be applied to governance costs, \ncountry-specific activities, and activities across several countries. Noncore funds include donor \nagency restrictions relating to specific themes or activities.  \n \n                                                \n4 TA 4893 - NEPAL: Preparing the Kathmandu Valley Water Distribution, Sewerage and Urban Development Project. \n5 Cambridge Economic Policy Limited. 2009. Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility Strategic Review 2008. \nLondon. ", "5 \n \n10.  From  2001  to  2009,  ADB  has  contributed  $1,750,000  to  PPIAF.  The  facility  has \napproved 13 ADB-initiated TA projects worth $2,816,440 (Appendix 3). In the initial period of \nmembership from 2001 to 2005, the World Bank hired consultants for ADB TA projects using \nWorld Bank procurement policies and guidelines. During this period, ADB was able to leverage \nfunding from the core fund as well as from ADB\u2019s own contribution, hence the larger amount for \napproved projects than actual contribution by ADB. In 2006, ADB and PPIAF agreed that ADB \ncould use ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) for the procurement of goods \nand services for PPIAF-financed TA projects. However, this agreement is restricted to ADB\u2019s \nown contribution held by PPIAF and does not cover the core fund or other noncore funds, which \nare still governed by World Bank procurement policies and guidelines. \n \n11.  PPIAF has advised that, for ADB to access funding from the core fund or other noncore \nfunds, PPIAF would have to request all contributors to the core fund or respective noncore fund \nto prepare an addendum to their grant agreements to allow ADB to implement PPIAF-funded TA \nprojects  financed  from  the  core  fund  or  other  noncore  funds  using  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. PPIAF has also advised that, given that \nWorld Bank procurement and consultant policies allow procurement of goods and services \nproduced by all countries (with limited exceptions), contributors to the core fund and other \nnoncore  funds  are  not  inclined  to  accept  the  nationality  restrictions  attached  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB would, therefore, in \nparallel have to pursue a waiver of these nationality restrictions from ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. \nGiven  the  number  of  contributors  involved,  PPIAF  has  requested  that  this  matter  first  be \ndiscussed in the PPIAF annual meeting to be held in the first quarter of 2010.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The main impact of this TA will be improved quality and quantity of infrastructure in \nADB\u2019s DMCs through private sector involvement. This will be achieved through (i) improved \ncapacity of DMC governments to design and execute private infrastructure projects; (ii) an \nincreased  number  of  pioneering  transactions  involving  the  private  sector;  (iii)  improved \nconsensus on policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms within DMCs to improve the enabling \nenvironment for private sector participation; and (iv) an increase in infrastructure development \nstrategies in DMCs. The expected outcome will be enhanced assistance for DMC governments \nto mobilize additional resources to initiate studies on PPI and provide ADB access to PPI \nstudies conducted under PPIAF. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.   Funding support from this TA will enable ADB to continue its partnership with PPIAF. \nADB\u2019s continued membership will provide ongoing benefits to ADB\u2019s DMCs as well as additional \nresources for promoting PPI in DMCs. The TA will support advisory and related activities, \nincluding \n \n(i)  framing infrastructure development strategies to take full advantage of the potential \nfor private involvement; \n(ii)  building consensus on appropriate policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms; \n(iii)  designing and implementing specific policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms; ", "6 \n \n(iv)  supporting the design and implementation of pioneering projects and transactions; \nand \n(v)  building  government  capacity  to  design  and  execute  private  infrastructure  and \narrangements for, and regulation of, private service providers. \n \n14.   The TA will provide a membership contribution to PPIAF. It will thus help to meet the \ncost of consulting services recruited by ADB as well as other eligible expenses for undertaking \nADB-initiated  PPIAF  projects  designed  to  encourage  PPI.  Through  its  membership  in  the \nProgram Council, ADB will play an important role in steering PPIAF project activities. In most \ncases,  these  projects  will  further  the  poverty  reduction  objectives  of  ADB  and  generally \ncomplement studies proposed by ADB in its private sector development strategy6 and ADB \nstrategic priorities as set out in Strategy 2020. \n \n15.  Leveraging  of  PPIAF  core  funds  is  critical  to  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  PPIAF.  ADB, \ntherefore, only wishes to make this next contribution to PPIAF after the following two conditions \nhave been satisfied: \n(i)  the PPIAF donors have agreed that ADB may apply its Procurement Guidelines \nand Guidelines on the Use of Consultants for the procurement of goods and \nservices for PPIAF-financed activities from the core fund and noncore funds \nwhere applicable; and  \n(ii)  the Board has waived the requirement that PPIAF funds administered by ADB \nmay only be used to finance procurement in ADB member countries of goods \nand services produced in member countries.  \nADB will enter into an agreement with the World Bank for its contribution to PPIAF.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.   ADB will contribute $500,000 to PPIAF, which will be used to finance consulting services \nand other costs.7 The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA Special Fund \n(TASF-other).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements for ADB\u2019s involvement in PPIAF are set forth in and \ngoverned by the PPIAF trust fund agreement and the guidelines signed by PPIAF and ADB on \n29 June 2005, as revised by the amendment letter signed on 5 October 2006. Under the \namended agreement, overall project management of ADB-initiated PPIAF projects is delegated \nto ADB. As such, procurement of goods and services will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Assuming the \nconditions in paragraph 15 have been satisfied, a revision to the trust fund agreement will be \nprepared and reflect the conditions around ADB\u2019s access to core funds and other noncore \nfunds. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s contribution will be provided after successful discussion and signing of a trust \nfund agreement between the trust fund administrator (the World Bank) and ADB. The TA will be \nimplemented from the date of signing the trust fund agreement for a 24 month-period, the latest \n                                                \n6 ADB. 2001.

", "7 \n \nagreed utilization closing date. The World Bank will recover a small charge for costs associated \nwith administering the trust funds which will be clearly stated in the trust fund agreement.  \n \n19.  The Office of Cofinancing Operations (OCO) is expected to administer the TA. OCO, \ntogether with the Energy, Transport and Water Division (RSID) of the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, will facilitate preparation of ADB applications for PPIAF grants. OCO \nwill coordinate ADB-initiated PPIAF projects, act as an intermediary with the PMU, and work \nwith the PMU to monitor closely all ongoing ADB-initiated PPIAF projects. Once individual \nprojects  are  approved  by  the  PPIAF  Program  Council  and  by  ADB,  responsibility  for \nimplementation will lie with the division that initiates the PPIAF proposal. 8  The OCO project \nofficer for this TA will disseminate information within ADB as follows: (i) establish a virtual group \nof staff members who will be kept informed of PPIAF activities, (ii) share reports and outputs of \nactivities with virtual group and relevant staff, (iii) share knowledge products and reports from \nPPIAF with the virtual group and relevant staff, and (iv) share lessons and information through \nADB workshops and communities of practice.  \n \n20.  The World Bank has instituted an annual single audit exercise for all trust funds. The \nproject officer for each approved activity is required to confirm to PPIAF that he or she has \ncomplied with the terms set forth in the PPIAF award letter; has exercised due diligence with \nrespect to the administration, management, and monitoring of the funds; and has ensured that \nall  expenses  and  disbursements  accord  with  World  Bank  procurement  and  administrative \nguidelines  (or  in  the  case  of  ADB\u2019s  contribution,  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants) PPIAF provides Program Council members with quarterly \nprogress reports on the status of approved activities. This TA does not trigger ADB safeguard \nrequirements, so use of ADB safeguard policies will not be mandatory. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility for the Contribution to the Public\u2013Private \nInfrastructure Advisory Facility, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n8  Since ADB project officers will develop proposals (which will include proposed activities, terms of reference for \nconsultants, financing plans, and proposed procurement arrangements) and submit these to the Program Council \nand/or PMU for review and no objection, it is not possible at the moment to provide precise cost estimates, \nfinancing plans, or consultant terms of reference.

A trust fund agreement between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World \nBank for the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) was signed on 28 August \n2001, 9 April 2003, 2005, and 13 November 2007. An amendment to the trust fund agreement \nfor the third contribution was signed on 5 October 2006. This amendment related to a change in \nimplementation arrangements in which project management of ADB projects is delegated to \nADB,  and  procurement  of  goods  and  services  follows  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and Procurement Guidelines for ADB-initiated projects. On 17 February 2009, the \ncurrent trust fund agreement was extended until 31 October 2012. Assuming the conditions in \nparagraph 15 of the TA report have been satisfied, a revision to the trust fund agreement for this \ncontribution be prepared and reflect the conditions around ADB\u2019s access to core funds and \nother noncore funds. \n \nTable A3.1 History of ADB Contributions to the  \nPublic\u2013Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility \nDate  Contribution \nJan 2001  The President of ADB approved a request for ADB to become a member of \nPPIAF  \nRegional technical assistance (REG-5989) of $250,000 made an initial \ncontribution to PPIAF  \nDec 2002  REG-60861 for $500,000 was approved to extend ADB membership by 2 years \nDec 2004  REG-62152 for $500,000 was approved to extend ADB membership for 2 years  \nSep 2007  REG-64113 for $500,000 was approved to extend ADB membership for 2 years \nPPIAF = Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, REG = regional. \nSource: ADB. \n \n2.  In total, ADB has contributed $1,750,000 to PPIAF from 2001 to 2009. Since joining \nPPIAF, ADB has approved 13 projects amounting to $2,816,440 (Table A3.2) to promote PPI. \nActual disbursements are less than this and remaining balances have been channeled back into \nADB\u2019s account in PPIAF. The balance in the ADB account as of 1 July 2009 is about $776,700 \n(which is made up of contributions, plus investment income, minus administration fees). The \nnew contribution would increase this to about $1,276,700 (less administration fees). Given the \nfocus  on  scaling  up  private  sector  operations  and  private  sector  development  in  ADB \noperations, there is already a pipeline of projects being developed to utilize this over the next \n12 months and the aim is to be able to access beyond ADB\u2019s contribution after that. \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2002.
