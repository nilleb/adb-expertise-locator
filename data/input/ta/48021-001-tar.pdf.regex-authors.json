INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the annual country program dialogue in December 2013, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a policy \nand advisory technical assistance (TA) for a study to develop a low-carbon transport policy for \nthe  Ningxia  Hui  Autonomous  Region  (NHAR).  A  fact-finding  mission  visited  the  NHAR  in \nSeptember 2014 and reached agreement with the executing agency on the impact, output, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting services. The TA is in ADB\u2019s TA program for the PRC for 2014. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As a result of rapid economic growth and urbanization, the PRC has made remarkable \nprogress in improving the quality of life since 1980. The provision of infrastructure and services \nfor passenger and freight transport and increased travel demand have played a key role in \neconomic  growth  and  urbanization.  However,  transport  also  has  adverse  effects  on  the \nenvironment, including through vehicle emissions. Globally, it is already a major contributor to \ncarbon dioxide (CO ) emissions, accounting for 23% of energy-related CO  emissions. The PRC \n2 2\nis now the world\u2019s largest source of CO  emissions, responsible for 25.4% of global CO\n2 2 \nemissions.2 The 2013 World Energy Outlook projects that emissions from the transport sector in \nthe PRC will reach 13% of total PRC emissions in 2035, compared to 8% in 2011.3 Despite the \ntechnology improvements in transport sector, the emissions from transport sector are expected \nto grow due to the increase of mobility needs and it calls for stronger low-carbon transport policy \nmeasures at the local level. \n \n3.  The government attaches great importance to the issue of climate change and has \ncommitted to a 40%\u201345% reduction in the carbon intensity of gross domestic product by 2020 \nrelative  to  2005.  Since  2006,  the  authorities  have  become  involved  in  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment  initiatives  to  make  cities  eco-friendly  and  low  carbon.  More  than  120  such \ninitiatives have been launched by several government departments and government-related \nentities, including the National Development and Reform Commission; Ministry of Transport; \nMinistry of Science and Technology; and Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Development.4 \n \n4.  The PRC may set a cap on its total CO  emissions when the 13th Five-Year Plan5 \n2\ncomes into force in 2016. However, this will be challenging to implement in the transport sector \nas the objective of reducing carbon emissions of transport has often been subordinated to the \npursuit of economic growth and urbanization at the local level, and few initiatives targeting low-\ncarbon  transport  are  formally  embedded  within  the  policy,  financing,  implementation,  and \noperational levels of the transport sector at provincial and local government level. The lack of \nlocally  adapted  objectives  and  indicators,  and  weaknesses  in  the  process  for  designing, \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 2 October 2014.  \n2  International Energy Agency. 2013.

The projection takes into account of changes in \nfuture policy assumptions for policies, population growth, energy pricing, fossil-fuel subsidies, CO  pricing and \n2\ntechnology. \n4  In January 2013, the Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Development selected a first batch of 90 pilot smart \ncities, comprising 37 prefecture cities, 50 districts and counties, and three townships. Traffic management is a key \naspect of most of these projects. \n5  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Support for the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan. \nManila. \n ", "2 \nmonitoring, and evaluating low-carbon transport, need to be addressed at provincial, local, and \nmunicipal government levels.  \n \n5.  The NHAR is located in northwestern PRC, and had a population of 6.5 million people in \n2012. It has five prefecture cities, 22 counties, and 192 townships.6 The autonomous region is \nexperiencing rapid urbanization, with the urban population reaching 3.28 million in 2012. It has \nnot  so  far  developed  a  specific  policy  on  low-carbon  transport  at  the  provincial  and  city \ngovernment  levels.  Parts  of  the  NHAR  with  relatively  lower  rates  of  motorization7 and \nurbanization8 currently have good potential for developing a low-carbon transport system based \non public transport, nonmotorized transport9 improvements, parking policy, and transit-oriented \ndevelopment.10 Such approaches could avoid the need for having to resort to restrictive policy \nmeasures such as vehicle licensing quotas, as seen in some mega cities in the PRC. \n \n6.  The  proposed TA  will  assist  the  government of  the  NHAR  and five  prefecture city \ngovernments  in  formulating  strategies  and  policies  for  low-carbon  transport.  The  TA  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC for 2011\u20132015,11 which supports \nthe government\u2019s efforts to foster a cleaner and more sustainable growth process (pillar 2) by \nsupporting the development of low-carbon transport systems, particularly in public transport.12 It \nis included in the PRC country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.13 \n \n7.  Formulation  of  the  TA  draws  upon  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  ADB\u2019s \nevaluation knowledge brief on Reducing Carbon Emissions from Transport Projects.14 The brief \nfound that low-carbon transport strategies based on the avoid\u2013shift\u2013improve (ASI) paradigm \ncan be the least costly ways to reduce CO  emissions, and that such strategies can produce \n2\nsignificant social and economic benefits for low-income people, who are more dependent on \npublic  transport  and  nonmotorized  transport. 15  The  brief  recommended  estimation  and \nmonitoring of carbon emissions, and adaptation of carbon emission reduction approaches in \nproject design and appraisal. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The expected impact of the TA is reduced carbon emissions from the transport sector in \nthe NHAR by 25% in 2030 compared to a business-as-usual baseline projection for the same \nyear.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  is  an  adopted  low-carbon  transport  policy  with  supporting \n                                                \n6  These are Guyuan, Shizuishan, Wuzhong, Yinchuan (the capital), and Zhongwei. \n7  In 2011, the NHAR had 46 motor vehicles per 1,000 people, which is well below the national average of 68. \n8  The urbanization rate of the NHAR in 2011 was 52.0%, which is lower than the national average of 53.7%. \n9  Nonmotorized transport includes pedestrian, bicycle and wheelchair transport.  \n10 A transit-oriented development is an urban planning and development approach in which public transport and \nnonmotorized transport play major roles in providing mobility and accessibility to bring housing, transport, and jobs \ntogether to achieve a sustainable urban pattern. A transit-oriented development neighborhood typically has a \ncenter with a transit station or stop, which is surrounded by relatively high-density development with progressively \nlower-density development spreading outward from the center.  \n11 ADB. 2012.

Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will adopt the ASI paradigm for developing a low-carbon transport strategy for \neach  of  the  NHAR\u2019s  five  prefecture  cities,  and  a  bottom-up  approach  for  developing  a \nconsolidated low-carbon transport strategy for the provincial government, building from the \nstrategies generated from each city. Future travel demand will be estimated using a simplified \ntravel  demand  forecast  model.  Low-carbon  transport  strategies  will  be  selected  after \nprefeasibility analysis and carbon emissions estimation using emission estimation tools. The \nselected strategies will be aligned to provide a phased implementation plan for each city, and \nthe plans for each city will then be consolidated into a provincial government implementation \nplan. \n \n10.  The TA will introduce an emissions estimation method for the NHAR, drawing upon \nexisting tools such as the Transport Emissions Evaluation Model for Projects (TEEMP)16 and \nthe For Future Inland Transport Systems17 model, or by using the method based on the travel \ndemand forecast model.18 The results from different tools will be reviewed and a preferred \napproach will be selected for evaluating the emissions reduction impact of various low-carbon \ntransport strategies for the project cities. \n \n11.  The five outputs of the TA will address the existing technical and institutional gaps in \ndeveloping a low-carbon transport policy and strategies for the NHAR: \n(i)  Output  1:  City-level  avoid\u2013shift\u2013improve  strategies  and  phased \nimplementation plans. The output will include (a) assessments of the transport \nsector and urban development of each city, (b) identification and assessment of \napplicable  ASI  strategies  for  each  city,  and  (c)  preparation  of  phased \nimplementation and investment plans. \n(ii)  Output  2:  Carbon  emissions  estimation  and  monitoring  framework.  The \noutput will include (a) a carbon emissions estimation and monitoring framework \nfor each city, (b) carbon emissions estimation results for selected ASI strategies, \nand (c) capacity development support for city officers to use the framework and \npreparation of user guidelines. \n(iii)  Output 3: Provincial low-carbon transport implementation plan. The output \nwill include (a) ASI strategy prioritization and selection criteria for implementation, \n(b) consolidated and phased ASI strategy implementation plans for the five cities \nfor  the  provincial  government,  and  (c)  an  investment  and  financing  plan  for \nphased implementation. \n                                                \n16 TEEMP has been developed as a Microsoft Excel-based, free-of-charge spreadsheet model by Clean Asia \nInitiative, together with the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, ADB, Cambridge Systematics, the \nUnited  Nations  Environment  Programme,  and  the  Global  Environment  Facility.  TEEMP  tools  were  initially \ndeveloped for evaluating the emissions impacts of ADB transport projects and have been modified and extended \nfor use on projects funded by the Global Environment Facility. TEEMP primarily evaluates the impacts of transport \nprojects on CO  emissions and, to some extent, air pollutant emissions using data gathered during the project \n2\nfeasibility study and operations. \n17 For Future Inland Transport Systems was developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe \nthrough a project funded by the United Nations Development Account. The model is freely available and allows the \nestimation of emissions from transport. It uses information on transport activities to derive fuel consumption and \nCO emissions, considering the influence of socioeconomic parameters and policies. \n2 \n18 Emissions estimation is widely available as a built-in module of travel demand forecast models. \n ", "4 \n(iv)  Output 4: Institutional reform and capacity development to support avoid\u2013\nshift\u2013improve strategy implementation. The output will include (a) proposals \nfor city-level institutional reform of the government and transport operators to \nsupport implementation of ASI strategies, (b) provincial government institutional \narrangements  for  supervising  and  monitoring  city  governments\u2019  ASI  strategy \nimplementation, and (c) capacity building for officers and transport operators on \nASI strategy implementation. \n(v)  Output 5: Knowledge products. Knowledge products will be produced on a \nlow-carbon transport policy and strategies for small cities and provinces in the \nPRC.  This  will  address  both  the  technical  and  institutional  aspects  of \nimplementing a low-carbon transport policy and strategies. \n \n12.  The TA requires that the local governments in the NHAR are committed to implementing \na low-carbon transport policy and that the central and NHAR governments intensify policy \ninterventions and provide necessary incentives for promoting the policy. The local governments \nhave assured ADB of their commitment. A key risk concerns whether consistent low-carbon \npolicies will be maintained by the different levels of government. The TA will reduce this risk by \nclosely  involving  the  NHAR  and  local  governments  in  TA  implementation  and  producing \nrecommendations to assist them with organizational and financial reform for supporting a low-\ncarbon transport policy. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), and (ii) $500,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund.19 The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff; suitably furnished office space with utilities \nand telecommunication access, information materials, data, maps, and other documents as \nneeded; and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The executing agency is the Ningxia Department of Finance, which will coordinate with \nand supervise the Ningxia Department of Transport, Ningxia Planning Bureau, Department of \nEnvironment  Protection,  five  city  governments,  and  transport  operators  during  TA \nimplementation. The consulting team will administer workshops, seminars, study tours, and \nsurveys. An international study and visit to countries that can provide examples of low carbon \ntransport strategies and best practices that are relevant to NHAR will help in preparing the \nknowledge product. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over an 18-month period from 1 November 2014 to 30 April \n2016 and will require a total of 17 person-months for six international consultants and 36 \nperson-months for seven national consultants. ADB will engage individual consultants and firms \nusing quality- and cost-based selection (90:10), in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The team leader (international consultant) \nwill be responsible for coordination and management of the consulting team, assisted by the \ndeputy team leader (national consultant). TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                \n19 Established by ADB. \n ", "  5 \n16.  The consulting team will require expertise in (i) low-carbon urban transport policy and \nstrategies; (ii) travel demand forecast methods and practices; (iii) emissions estimation methods, \nincluding For Future Inland Transport Systems, TEEMP, and travel demand forecast-based \nmethods; (iv) preparing cost estimates for policy and investment project implementation; and \n(v) familiarity  with  the  Government  of  the  PRC  organizational  structures  and  financial \nmechanisms in the transport sector. It will be responsible for organizing a TA working group and \nworkshops, seminars, study tours, and surveys, with assistance from the executing agency \nduring TA implementation.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  for  Developing  Pathways  to  Low-Carbon  Transport  in  Ningxia  Hui \nAutonomous Region, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nReduced carbon  Reduction of transport sector  Report from the  Central  government  maintains \nemissions from the  carbon emissions in the  provincial  low-carbon transport policy with a \ntransport sector in the  NHAR by 25% in 2030  government  monitoring mechanism. \nNHAR  compared to business-as-\n \nusual baseline projection for \nthe same year \nOutcome      Assumption \nAdopted low-carbon  ASI strategies are reflected in  Transport sector  Provincial government intensifies \ntransport policy with  the phased transport sector  investment plan of  policy interventions and \nsupporting provincial  investment plans of the  the provincial and  necessary incentives for \nand local government  provincial and five local  local governments   promoting low-carbon transport \nreform and private  governments.  policy and support. \n \nsector participation \nReform of the provincial and  Risks \nProvincial and local \nfive local governments\u2019  The risk of maintaining \ngovernments\u2019 \norganization and financing  consistency of low-carbon \nreports on approved \nmechanism for  policies among the different \nreforms \nmainstreaming low-carbon  levels of the government exists. \ntransport policy \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
