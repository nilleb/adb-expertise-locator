THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed debt \nfinancing through senior secured nonconvertible debentures (NCDs) of up to $150,000,000, in \nIndian rupee equivalent, to Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company Limited (Chola) \nfor the Expanding Credit Delivery for Micro-, Small-, and Medium-Sized Enterprises Project in \nIndia. \n \n2.  The project entails ADB providing longer-term financing to Chola, a leading nonbank \nfinance company, for onlending to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), half of \nwhich will be from the lagging states in India. ADB\u2019s financing will meet Chola\u2019s requirements for \nmedium-term funds, which will help fund longer-tenor MSME loans and diversify Chola\u2019s funding \nmix. Given the slowdown in credit growth from banks in India in FYE 2018, ADB\u2019s funding will \nalso have a countercyclical benefit on MSMEs\u2019 access to finance, translating into economic \ngrowth and employment.  \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Finance sector overview. India\u2019s finance sector is evolving, with commercial banks \ndominating the sector. There were 216 banks as of fiscal year-end 2017 (FYE2017), including \n149 scheduled commercial banks registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Total deposits \nof all banks stood at \u20b9107.0 trillion and total loans amounted to \u20b978.0 trillion.1 The excessive \nexposure of certain banks to high-risk sectors, such as power and metals and mining, and RBI\u2019s \nstricter provisioning and disclosure policies on distressed loans; resulted in a deterioration in asset \nquality for the banking sector. Nonperforming asset (NPA) ratios increased from 3.5% in FY2013 \nto 7.6% in FY2016 and to 9.6% in FY2017. The decline in asset quality and limited access to new \ncapital have pushed the sector\u2019s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) down from 14.0% at FYE2013 to \n13.6% at FYE2017. Profitability also declined. Consequently, commercial banks have severely \ncurtailed their lending operations, with credit growth slowing to its lowest level; 4.6% at FYE2017 \nagainst an average of 12.5% in the period FY2008 to FY2016.2 Furthermore, credit offtake has \nbeen focussed on retail and consumer financing, which further constricted access to formal \nfinancing for underserved micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). \n \n4.  Nonbank financial companies. Nonbank financial companies (NBFCs) complement the \nbanking  sector  in  targeting  under  or  unbanked  segments  of  the  population  with  tailored \napproaches and products. Also, given RBI\u2019s policy for extending credit to priority sectors, some \nbanks partially fulfil their mandated requirements by extending credit through NBFCs, benefitting \nfrom the latter\u2019s client reach, geographic coverage, and adaptability of products, which generate \nloans in priority sectors.3 At FYE2017, 11,517 NBFCs had total loans outstanding of \u20b913 trillion \n(equivalent to 17% of total financial system assets).4 While the overall asset quality of NBFCs is \nbetter than that of the banking sector, there has been an increase in gross NPAs. NBFCs\u2019 CAR \n                                                \n1  RBI.

Policy RBI/2015-16/53 FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.4/04.09.01/2015-16. As per the policy, 40% of adjusted net \nbank loans must be for priority sectors, including agriculture, MSMEs, export credit, education, housing, social \ninfrastructure, and renewable energy. \n4  RBI.

Profitability  also  declined  moderately  in  the  same  period  as  net  interest  margins \nnarrowed.5 While both commercial banks and NBFCs can provide much-needed financing for \nMSMEs, NBFCs are well-placed in terms of their capitalization, and benefit from manageable \nNPAs and maintain their focus on growth. \n \n5.  Micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprise subsector. It is estimated that about 48.8 \nmillion MSMEs operated across all industries in India, employing more than 111 million people as \nof 2014.6 Also, MSMEs accounted for 45% of the Indian industrial output in 20127, and the Ministry \nof Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises estimated that MSMEs accounted for 50% of exports in \n2015\u20132016.8 About 94% of MSMEs are unregistered, making statistical estimation difficult; \nnonetheless, MSMEs\u2019 contribution to the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to \ngrow at 11.5% per year, outpacing total GDP growth. An important segment of MSMEs is the \nlogistics, distribution, warehousing, and transportation business, in which MSMEs with fleets of \nthree to five vehicles on average are active, and related to it is the commercial vehicle financing \nactivity. The commercial vehicle financing market potential as of FYE2017 was estimated at \u20b94.1 \ntrillion, of which about 54% is for pre-owned vehicles.9 \n \n6.  Evidence suggests that MSMEs\u2019 contribution to India\u2019s GDP falls below the potential for \nthis  sector.  Most  MSMEs  in  India  are  micro  and  small  enterprises;  unlike  similarly  sized \nenterprises in many other countries, however, most of these firms never grow out of the informal \nsector in which they start or may even diminish in size over time.10 This lack of enterprise \ndevelopment and growth has severe implications for employment, per capita GDP growth, and \nthe development of India\u2019s middle-income segment. \n \n7.  Access to finance and credit. Despite the size of the finance sector and the significant \nstrides the government has been making, including the successful Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan \nYojana (Prime Minister\u2019s People Money Scheme), access to finance remains a key issue,11 with \nfewer than 15.71% of men and 11.42% of women accessing credit through formal channels \n(based on the percentage of people borrowing money).12 MSMEs\u2019 lack of adequate access to \nfinance is seen as a major obstacle to growth, with 78.2% of MSMEs self-financing and only 2.0% \nobtaining funds from financial institutions (footnote 7). This is the reason why most micro and \nsmall  enterprises  do  not  graduate  to  formal  employment-making  small-  and  medium-sized \n                                                \n5  RBI. 2017.

A statistical update on employment in the informal \nsector published by the International Labour Organization in 2012 showed that India has one of the world\u2019s largest \ninformal sectors, representing 83.6% of nonagricultural employment. \n11 Government of India, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). https://www.pmjdy.gov.in/account. The proportion \nof unbanked people in India has declined from 65% in 2011 following the launch by the Government of India of the \nPradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, which aims to open 100 million bank accounts for poor families. As of 4 October \n2017, more than 300 million accounts have been opened under the program. \n12 World  Bank.  Gender  Statistics  Databank.  http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=gender-\nstatistics#selectedDimension_GS_Ctry (accessed 20 September 2017). \n ", "3 \nenterprises (SMEs).13 MSMEs in logistics and distribution services and manufacturing get further \nexcluded from the mainstream finance sector because of their small finance requirements, \ninsufficient proof of income, longer processing time for loans, and high access costs.14 While \nfinancing needs vary, financial institutions typically have limited exposure to MSMEs compared \nwith larger commercial enterprises because MSMEs are seen as being higher risk and have \nlimited access to immovable collateral. There are estimates that the MSME subsector\u2019s total \nfinancing requirement is about \u20b932.5 trillion, of which \u20b926.0 trillion is for debt financing (footnote \n7). \n \n8.  Investment rationale. Given the continued need to address access to finance for the \nunderserved customer segments in India, nonsovereign operations of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has supported financial institution partners that have demonstrated the ability to \nreach under-banked segments of the population on a commercial and sustainable basis. ADB \nhas supported projects to address (i) access to credit for women borrowers in self-help groups \nand access to funding for small farmers;15 (ii) affordable housing finance;16 (iii) funding for micro \nand small entrepreneurs, including women, in lagging states and rural areas through bank and \nNBFC  lending;  and  (iv)  sanitation  finance.17 In  addition  to  its  direct  funding  to  banks  and \nmicrofinance institutions for onlending to under-banked segments, ADB has supported financial \ninclusion in India through the Microfinance Risk Participation Program and an equity investment \nin a credit rating agency.18 To build on these initiatives and promote financial inclusion in India, \nADB is targeting partnerships with financial institutions involved in the MSMEs subsector to \nsupport job creation and the development of India\u2019s \u201cmissing middle\u201d (SMEs and the lower middle-\nincome segment). NBFCs such as Capital First Limited, for which ADB approved a $150 million \ndebt investment in September 2017,19 are playing a critical role in addressing MSME financing \nneeds with low turnaround time and last mile capital delivery, based on better adapted loan \nproducts, customized credit models and delivery processes, and reliance on market information \nand empirical data. \n \n9.  Based in Chennai, Chola is a pan-Indian NBFC selected by ADB for its track record in \nproviding finance to MSMEs in logistics and distribution services, which are critical for job creation \nand overall economic growth.

Manila. \n ", "4 \ntowns where the MSMEs are predominately domiciled, and about 70% of its total portfolio in states \nwith a lower level of penetration by banks and formal financing institutions, Chola is an attractive \npartner for ADB. Additionally, 40\u201350% of its total loans qualify as priority sector lending. In contrast \nto trends across the finance sector, Chola has maintained asset growth, lowered its NPA levels, \nand broadly sustained its profitability and strong capital base in FY2017. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n10.  Overview. Founded in 1979 by the Murugappa Group, Chola has consistently maintained \nits leadership in the market and is among the top three in its specialized segment. Founded in \n1900, the Murugappa Group operates 28 businesses, including nine listed entities. Chola had \ntotal assets under management of \u20b9369 billion as of FYE2017 and a customer base of over \n750,000 clients. It offers a diversified suite of loan products to MSMEs through two main lines: \ncommercial vehicle finance (69% of the total portfolio) and loans against property (LAPs) (28% of \nthe total portfolio). It is an industry leader in vehicle finance, focusing on smaller fleet operators \n(three to five vehicles). The commercial vehicle finance portfolio is diversified along eight main \nproduct lines: light commercial vehicles (LCV), cars and multi-utility vehicles, heavy commercial \nvehicles, vehicle refinance, used vehicles, tractors, 3-wheelers and small commercial vehicles, \nand construction equipment. LAPs are generally business loans backed by property. Chola was \none of the first movers into the market in 2006 and has since focused on a segment consisting \nmostly of small self-employed nonprofessional entrepreneurs in manufacturing, retail, trading, \ntextiles, and small-scale industries, which are often excluded from the SME financing offered by \ncommercial banks. \n \n11.  Business strategy. To support its future growth, Chola is arranging for incremental \nfunding. Its commercial vehicle financing business is expected to drive portfolio growth, while LAP \nis projected to grow at a slower pace. Chola moderated the growth of its LAP portfolio as it \nmitigates the rising risks in this segment from a decline in property prices and fall in yields driven \nby increasing competition. The balance of growth will come from newly pilot-tested products such \nas mortgage loans and agribusiness loans. Improved profitability is expected from larger volumes \ndelivered under Chola\u2019s established products, efficiency gains, and a selective focus on higher-\nyielding asset classes. To support its growth strategy, Chola will add new branches during \nFY2017 and FY2018, mostly in smaller cities and townships in remote parts of India, where there \nis limited presence of banks and formal financial institutions. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n12.  Ownership. Chola is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock \nExchange and has about 23,000 shareholders. The shareholding structure consists of promoters \n(53.1%); financial institutional investors (36.6%)20, and noninstitutional investors (10.3%). The \npromoter\u2019s stake is primarily held by TI Financial Holdings Ltd, which is also a listed Murugappa \nGroup entity, operating as an investment holding company. Integrity due diligence was conducted \nand identified no significant or potentially significant integrity risks.21 ADB\u2019s review of the entity \ndoes not give ADB cause to believe that such entity has been established or is being used for \nmoney laundering or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the project. \n \n                                                \n20 Of which mutual funds (13.8%) and foreign portfolio investors (22.6%), including IFC, held the largest stakes. \n21 ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank's Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila. \n ", "5 \n13.  Management. Vellayan Subbiah was Chola\u2019s managing director from August 2010 to \nAugust 2017. Currently he has moved to Tube Investments as Managing Director (Designate). N. \nSrinivasan, who was the vice chairman and non-executive director on Chola\u2019s board, replaced \nSubbiah and is now the Executive Vice Chairman and Managing Director of the Company. \nSrinivasan is a Murugappa Group veteran and has served as a member of the Murugappa \ncorporate board as well as several group companies. He was lead director of the Financial \nServices Group within the Murugappa Corporate Advisory Board and was instrumental in leading \na strategic realignment of the company during 2008\u20132010. Chola\u2019s senior management has solid \nexperience in financial services and has grown from within company ranks. \n \n14.  Governance structure. Four independent directors, one executive director, and one \nmanaging director make up Chola\u2019s board. M.B.N. Rao, an independent director who has been \non Chola\u2019s board since 2010 and has over 42 years of banking experience, chairs the board. Two \nof the other three independent directors also possess extensive banking experience, having held \ntop executive and director positions at banks and financial institutions. The audit, stakeholders\u2019 \nrelationship, corporate social responsibility, nomination and remuneration, risk management, and \nbusiness subcommittees support the board. Chola is well-regarded for its management quality22 \nand  maintains  strong  corporate  governance  practices  and  good  disclosure  and  oversight \npractices, as seen in its adoption of stringent RBI norms, over one year ahead of the allowed \ntimeline. \n \n15.  Risk management. Chola has institutionalized a formal risk reporting framework with \nspecifically identified risk parameters, monitored to prescribed levels. This framework, developed \nin-house, calculates the Chola Composite Risk Index, which highlights the level, movement, and \ndirection of defined critical risks. These key risk indicators are aligned with the company\u2019s overall \nrisk appetite framework, which is approved by the board. The framework includes daily monitoring \nwith help from data analytics and algorithmic models that were also developed in-house by its risk \nmanagement team and reviewed closely by the internal audit unit. The credit appraisal process \nincludes a detailed risk assessment of the borrowers and ongoing monitoring to identify portfolio \ntrends and implement necessary credit policy changes. Chola\u2019s credit process is strictly defined, \nwhile standards and permissible deviations are well specified. Decision-making is done online \nusing an in-house application platform which is decentralized, with segregation of authority and \nresponsibility across business teams. The credit process is implemented through the sales, credit \nunderwriting, independent risk, operations, collection, monitoring, and internal audit teams, and a \nseparate frauds-control unit. \n \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n16.  ADB will provide debt financing to Chola by subscribing to up to $150 million, in Indian \nrupee equivalent, of senior secured NCDs, in three tranches of $50 million each, of tenors of 3,4, \nand 5 years; with full recourse to Chola\u2019s balance sheet.23 \n \n                                                \n22 CRISIL Ratings. 2016.

Mumbai. \n23 NCDs are a form of fixed maturity debt security that cannot be converted to company equity or stock and are regulated \nby RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Upon issuance, the NCDs will be listed on the Bombay \nStock Exchange and/or the National Stock Exchange. \n ", "6 \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  Use of proceeds. Chola will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s debt financing to finance loans to \nMSMEs in semi-urban and rural areas in India, with up to 30% of ADB\u2019s funding for the LAP \nsegment, and at least 50% of the funding targeting lagging states.24 \n \n18.  Reporting arrangements. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will monitor the \nproject. Chola will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular intervals and as \nrequested. These will include (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis, (ii) audited \nfinancial statements on an annual basis, (iii) compliance certificates for financial covenants on a \nquarterly basis, (iv) reporting on the MSME loan portfolio on an annual basis, and (v) annual \nreporting on selected development indicators agreed by ADB and the borrower. \n \n19.  Evaluation. Chola will prepare and submit monitoring reports to ADB regularly, and at \nleast annually. The Company will submit the first report no later than 12 months after the first \ndisbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n20.  Support micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprise growth and development of \nlogistics, distribution, and transport-related industries. ADB funding will support growth and \njob creation in India\u2019s MSME segments through improved access to finance and at a period where \ncommercial banks have decreased lending. Through the funding, MSMEs engaged in logistics, \ndistribution, and transportation activities, and MSMEs seeking loans for investment and working \ncapital will benefit from access to term financing. This lending would be focused primarily on \nlagging states and on rural and semi-urban areas, where access to finance is even more limited. \n \n21.  Provide  access  to  local  currency  longer-tenor  debt.  In  general,  NBFCs  have \nhistorically extended relatively shorter-tenor loans, given the funding constraints and the need to \nmaintain a matched asset\u2013liability profile. This adversely affects borrowers who service debt over \na  shorter  period,  lesser than  the  economic  life  of the  underlying financed  asset.  Chola  is \naddressing this issue by diversifying its funding base and reducing its dependence on shorter-\nmaturity bank funding. Access to capital markets is still constrained, particularly for longer-tenor \nfunds for NBFCs, as about 78.5% of the bonds and/or debentures raised by financial institutions \nduring September\u2013February 2017 had tenors of less than 2 years.25 Debt financing from ADB, of \ntenors ranging from 3 to 5 years, will provide Chola the scarce medium-term funds it needs to \ndiversify its liability mix and fund longer-tenor MSME loan products. \n \n \n                                                \n24 Lagging states include low-income states with high poverty incidence and special category states. These include \nAssam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, \nNagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal. \n25 S.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n22.  Impact. The  project  is aligned  with the following  impact:  access to finance for the \nunderserved  enhanced,  contributing  to  finance  sector  development  in  alignment  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s financial inclusion agenda. \n \n23.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: sustainability of Chola\u2019s lending \nactivities to MSME in India demonstrated. \n \n24.  Output. The output will be Chola\u2019s increased capacity to finance underserved MSMEs, \nincluding MSMEs led by women and in lagging states in India. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support for the finance sector \nby helping to develop financial infrastructure, institutions, products, and services. The proposed \ntransaction contributes to finance sector development by supporting the growth of an NBFC, \nwhich is an important component of the finance sector in India.26 ADB\u2019s Midterm Review also \nseeks to promote inclusive growth. Without access to formal financial services, lower-income \npeople or underserved segments of the population will be excluded from the growth process and \nits benefits. According to ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u2013202227 and the \ncountry operations business plan, 2017\u20132019, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will continue to \nsupport the finance sector and MSME development in India, which is also a high priority for the \ngovernment. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n26.  The proposed ADB debt financing is classified category FI treated as C for impacts on the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The financial intermediary\u2019s \nbusiness activities have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts and are unlikely to entail \nimpacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The financial intermediary will apply \nADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  exclude  all  projects  that  will  have  adverse \nenvironmental and social safeguards impacts, ensure that investments using ADB funds abide by \napplicable national laws and regulations, and comply with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The financial intermediary will confirm this in its periodic report to ADB and need not apply \nany other specific safeguard requirements. \n \n27.  Chola will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards. Chola will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws and (ii) the \nmeasures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will be conducted \nfollowing ADB requirements. The transaction is classified as some gender elements. \n \n                                                \n26 ADB. 2014.

Anticorruption Policy \n \n28.  Chola was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. Chola\u2019s know-your-\ncustomer and anti-money laundering policies, in addition to the requirements placed by RBI, \nmitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. ADB will ensure that the investment \ndocumentation includes (i) appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and \nthe financing of terrorism; and (ii) remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Assurances \n \n29.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),28 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of India \nhas no objection to the proposed assistance to Chola. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in a form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n30.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  debt  financing  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ndebt financing through senior secured nonconvertible debentures of up to $150,000,000, in Indian \nrupee equivalent, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to Cholamandalam Investment and \nFinance Company Limited for the Expanding Credit Delivery for Micro-, Small-, and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises Project in India, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n16 November 2017 \n \n \n                                                \n28  ADB. 1966.
