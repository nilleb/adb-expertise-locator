THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $8,100,000, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $4,800,000; and (ii) a B loan of up to $3,300,000 \nto Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited (the borrower) for the Prime Road \nNational Solar Park Project in Cambodia. The report also describes the proposed administration \nof a loan of up to $4,200,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector \nin Asia II (CFPS II)1 for the Prime Road National Solar Park Project, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the \nadministration of the CFPS II loan. \n \n2.  The limited recourse project finance loan will support the borrower in developing and \noperating a 60-megawatt alternating current (MWac) solar photovoltaic power plant in Kampong \nChhnang Province, in Cambodia (the project). The project is the culmination of a One Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) effort over several years to develop a solar park in Cambodia involving \nthe Southeast Asia Department (SERD), the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment,  the  Office  of  Public\u2013Private  Partnership,  and  the  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment (PSOD). Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited was awarded the \nproject through a competitive reverse auction tender process that resulted in the lowest utility-\nscale solar tariff in Southeast Asia at the time: $0.03877 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The ADB loan \nwill meet the borrower\u2019s requirements for longer-tenor, United States dollar-denominated project \nfinancing, which local financial institutions are unable to provide. ADB has led the transaction and \nwill  mobilize  more  than  $5  of  cofinancing  from  commercial,  development  finance,  and \nconcessional sources for every $1 of ADB investment. CFPS II concessional financing helped \ncontribute to a financially viable bid result with a competitive tariff. The project will contribute to \nADB\u2019s climate change mitigation efforts by reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions in the \nenergy sector by 110,700 tons per year. Classified effective gender mainstreaming, the project \nwill also promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in Cambodia. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n3.  Since the early 1990s, Cambodia has enacted wide-ranging reforms and transformed itself \nfrom a country beset by 3 decades of civil conflict and instability to a high-growth, market-oriented \neconomy. Its economic growth reached an average rate of 6.4% from 2009 to 2019,2 and the \npoverty rate fell substantially from 30.1% in 2009 to 12.9% in 2018.3 The household electrification \nrate also increased significantly from 19% in 2009 to 75% in 2019.4 \n \n4.  Total electricity demand grew from 2,077 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2009 to 12,015 GWh \nin 2019, and is expected to reach 24,184 GWh by 2025 under a medium-growth scenario that \nADB helped prepare for Cambodia\u2019s Power Development Master Plan (2020\u20132040).5 While the \n \n1  Financing partner: The Government of Canada, as represented by the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and \nDevelopment (\u201cDFATD\u201d). \n2  ADB. 2020.

", "2 \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  will  likely  lead to  a  deceleration  of  this  growth \ntrajectory, pre-crisis growth patterns are expected to reemerge in tandem with an eventual \neconomic recovery. \n \n5.  Cambodia\u2019s power supply still depends heavily on hydropower, coal, diesel, and imports \nfrom neighboring countries. Its installed capacity totaled 2,756 megawatts (MW) at the end of \n2019, of which hydropower accounted for the largest share (48%), followed by coal (24%). \nCambodia relies on a further 627 MW of cross-border capacity from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Thailand, and Viet Nam. However, solar is a promising renewable energy source in \nCambodia, potentially complementing hydropower resources and reducing reliance on coal and \ndiesel generation. The country enjoys some of the highest solar resources in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion, with solar irradiance measuring on average 1,400 kWh\u20131,800 kWh per square meter \nper year throughout the country, for an estimated technical potential of more than 8,000 MW.6 \n \n6.  In June 2016, the Government of Cambodia received approval from the multidonor climate \ninvestment funds for an investment plan under the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy for Low-Income \nCountries  Program.  The  program  investment  plan  in  Cambodia  included  $21.3  million  to \naccelerate solar power through both the public and private sectors.7 In 2016, ADB also approved \na loan to support the first utility-scale solar project in Cambodia, the Bavet solar project.8 The \nsuccess and experience with this project helped Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC), the national \nutility, get more comfortable with intermittent solar resources. \n \n7.  In 2017, at the government\u2019s request, SERD developed a preliminary national solar \nphotovoltaic grid integration study and road map for EDC. Following this study, SERD presented \nthe idea of a large-scale solar park to EDC, to promote solar at scale and help EDC gain \nexperience in procuring power from the private sector through transparent and competitive \nprocesses, using standardized legal and commercial agreements. In 2019, ADB approved the \nCambodia National Solar Park Project, which will be able to accommodate at least 100 MWac of \nsolar photovoltaic capacity and consists of 150\u2013200 hectares (ha) of land, fencing, drainage, \nroads, and plant buildings, a substation, and a transmission line.9 The solar park will also host the \nfirst utility-scale pilot battery energy storage installation in Cambodia with up to 16 megawatt-\nhours of capacity.10 Transaction advisory services provided by ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013Private \nPartnership to EDC helped prepare and conduct a competitive reverse auction11 tender to procure \nthe first 60 MWac of power from the solar park which has culminated in this project. The remaining \n40 MWac of capacity in the solar park will be tendered in a second phase.12 \n \n8.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n2.  Project Design \n9.  The project is in Kampong Chhnang Province 70 kilometers from the capital, Phnom Penh, \none of the main electricity demand centers in Cambodia responsible for about 70% of the national \nelectricity demand. To provide 60 MWac of power to the grid, the borrower will install 78 MW of \n \n6  ADB. 2018. Cambodia Energy Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Roadmap. Manila. \n7  Government of Cambodia. 2016.

The project represents phase 1 of the planned 100 MWac Cambodian National Solar Park \nProject (footnote 9 and footnote 12), the first large-scale solar park in Southeast Asia and an \nimportant One ADB initiative. The sponsor won the project through a competitive international \nbidding process among 26 short-listed participants. PSOD supported 20 of the bidders with a \nletter of support and indicative term sheet. The project achieved the then lowest utility-scale solar \ntariff in Southeast Asia of $0.03877 per kWh. This will help lower the electricity price in Cambodia, \nwhich is among the highest in the region.14 The project company has entered into a 20-year power \npurchase agreement (PPA) with EDC, the state-owned utility, to supply 60 MWac of power to the \ndesignated EDC substation inside the solar park. EDC will provide the project land. EDC is also \nbuilding a dedicated transmission line for the solar park with ADB sovereign assistance. \n \n11.  Cambodia has policies on both renewable energy and gender equality, but these are not \nintegrated or mutually conducive. In energy-related public sector operations, men still tend to \ndominate the technical and managerial roles, while women are typically hired into finance and \naccounting functions. This is particularly true across the lower Mekong region.15 The low literacy \nand education levels of women in the workforce, combined with attitudes toward gender roles that \nemphasize women as \u201clower status\u201d and \u201chousehold managers,\u201d limit their livelihood alternatives \nor opportunities for higher-level occupations and decision-making positions.16 \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsor \n12.  The borrower is Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited, a special-purpose \nvehicle incorporated in Cambodia to implement the project. It will be about 100%17 owned by \nPrime Road Alternative Company Limited (Prime Road Alternative, the sponsor), a pioneering \nsolar energy system developer in Thailand and a part of the Prime Road Group. \n \n13.  Prime Road Group is an investment group based in Thailand with diversified interests in \nrenewable energy, real estate, and waste management, and a regional focus in Asia and the \nPacific. The group is a new client for ADB. Prime Road Power Public Company Limited is the \ninvestment holding company for the group\u2019s renewable energy business (holding 100% interest in \nthe sponsor) with a market capitalization of B8.0 billion as of 3 November 2020. CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED. The group has a 7-year track record in the development, construction, \nand operations of solar power plants; its total portfolio of 286 MW consists of 22 projects in \noperation with an installed capacity of 178 MW, and four projects under development and \nconstruction with an aggregate capacity of 108 MW. \n \n14.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impacts. While Cambodia reported relatively few \nCOVID-19 cases, the virus-induced global economic slowdown will affect its three most important \nindustries\u2014construction, tourism, and apparel exports\u2014which account for more than 70% of \neconomic  growth  and  almost  40%  of  total  employment.18 ADB  estimates  that  Cambodia\u2019s \neconomic growth will be negative in 2020, before returning to a positive growth rate of nearly 6% \nin 2021.19 Reports suggest that COVID-19 has affected power demand in the first half of 2020.20 \nHowever, it has not had any material impact on the project\u2019s progress. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n17.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) exploration and development \nof environmentally and socially acceptable energy resources needed to supply all sectors of \nCambodia's economy encouraged, and (ii) renewable energy to reduce Cambodia\u2019s greenhouse \ngas emissions promoted. \n \n18.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: energy generated from renewable \nsources increased. \n \n19.  Outputs. The project has four outputs: (i) a new solar power plant constructed, (ii) local \nemployment with enhanced gender equality generated, (iii) gender equality of employment \nstrengthened, and (iv) gender equality in the community increased. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n20.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which outlines seven operational priorities to tackle the development \nchallenges in Asia and the Pacific.21 The project supports three of them: (i) tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (ii) \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; and (iii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality.  It  also  supports  Strategy  2030\u2019s  objectives  to  expand  the  role  of  private  sector \noperations, mobilize additional resources on top of ADB\u2019s own financing, and deliver $80 billion \nof cumulative climate financing by 2030. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2019\u20132023 for Cambodia, which calls for continued ADB investment into renewable \nenergy in support of sustainable and inclusive growth.22 \n \n21.  Consistency with sector strategy. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which \nsupports wider access to energy through investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy \nprojects.23 Consistent with the One ADB approach, the project benefitted from close coordination \nwith ADB\u2019s SERD in assessing and analyzing Cambodia\u2019s energy sector. \n \n22.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n26.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n27.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance comprises (i) an A loan of up to $4,800,000; (ii) a B loan of up \nto $3,300,000; and (iii) a concessional loan of up to $4,200,000 to be provided by CFPS II and to \nbe administered by ADB. The ADB financing will meet the borrower\u2019s requirements for longer-\ntenor, United States dollar-denominated project financing, which local financial institutions are \nunable to provide. The concessional financing from CFPS II helped contribute to a financially \nviable bid result with a competitive tariff. ADB has been leading the transaction which is expected \n \n24 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nto  mobilize  cofinancing  from  commercial,  development  finance,  and  concessional  sources. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n28.  Because of concerns about political risk and the nascent state of the local banking sector, \nobtaining long-term financing necessary for infrastructure investments remains a challenge in \nCambodia. ADB\u2019s lead role in the transaction helps to mobilize a comprehensive long-term \nfinancing package for a landmark renewable energy project in the region. Its early engagement \nin the project and its ability to catalyze long-term loans from a variety of sources, including a \ncommercial bank, gave bidders more confidence that debt finance would be available, thereby \ncontributing to lower tariff bids. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s  strong  support  at  all  stages  of  the  project  will  demonstrate  the  benefits  of \ntransparent and competitive bidding, long-term financing, and clean energy at scale. It also \nhighlights the potential to develop Cambodia\u2019s power supply through low-cost public\u2013private \npartnership arrangements from domestic renewable energy sources, providing an alternative to \ncoal-fired generation. A successful implementation will show that solar power infrastructure \nprojects can be developed in a transparent manner, while achieving very competitive tariffs at \nlevels well below grid parity even in frontier markets that are perceived as more challenging. \nADB\u2019s involvement also helped enhance the project\u2019s environmental and social management \npractices, including stronger gender benefits. \n \nC.  Risks \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. \n \n31.  An independent consultant prepared an initial environmental and social examination \nreport for the project. No protected areas or particularly sensitive environmental receptors were \nidentified within or adjacent to the project site. The potential environmental impacts (e.g., noise, \nvibration,  dust,  waste  generation,  ground  contamination,  and  soil  erosion)  are  generally \nassociated with construction activities. These impacts are considered to be site-specific and short-\nterm, and can be effectively managed by implementing good engineering, construction, and \nproject management practices as well as preventive and control measures reflected in the World \nBank Group\u2019s Environmental, Health, and Safety General Guidelines, and detailed in the site-\nspecific environmental management plans. Occupational health and safety risks will be mitigated \nthrough the development of a health and safety plan that will include routine training, monitoring, \nand the provision of personal protective equipment. Environmental and occupational health and \nsafety provisions, consistent with the requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement, will be \nincorporated into the contractor agreements. \n ", "7 \n32.  The project does not require involuntary resettlement, and no distinct and vulnerable \nindigenous  people  groups  were  identified  in  the  area.  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION \nDELETED. \n \n33.
