INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming mission in December 2009, the Government of the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance for \ncapacity development technical assistance (TA) to help the Shandong provincial government \n(SPG) develop an energy manager program for the province. The TA was included in ADB's \n2011 nonlending pipeline for the PRC. The concept paper was approved on 8 July 2010. During \nthe fact-finding mission for a proposed loan to the PRC for the Shandong Energy Efficiency and \nEmission  Reduction  Project,  it  was  agreed  with  the  SPG  that  the  TA  will  be  processed \nindependently, as opposed to TA attached to the proposed loan for Shandong.1 In October 2010, \na separate fact-finding mission for the TA was conducted where an agreement was reached \nwith the government on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, and \nfinancing plan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Shandong is the second-largest province in the PRC in terms of industrial outputs with \nits industrial sector consuming more than 75% of the total energy of the province in 2009. The \nhigh concentration of energy-intensive heavy industries and relatively low energy efficiency \nprompted Shandong province to set a target of reducing its energy intensity by 22% during the \nEleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010, which is 2% more than the national target. To meet this \nstringent target, the SPG has devised and successfully implemented various policies, including \nincentives to guide and promote energy-saving work that enabled it to achieve 22.1% reduction \nin energy intensity during the 11th plan. However, its energy intensity is still high and there are \nsignificant opportunities for further reduction.  \n \n3.  In recent times, there has been a surge in capacity development and investments in \nenergy efficiency and emission reductions fostered by the PRC central government and funded \nby various organizations, including ADB and the World Bank. However, these investments are \nnot matched by the equally urgent need to develop the \u201csoft\u201d side of energy efficiency, i.e., train \nprofessionals to become fully conversant with the technical and financial aspects of energy \nefficiency projects. These professionals generally referred to as energy managers, can guide, \nidentify, plan, and supervise energy efficiency endeavors in industrial enterprises. They will help \nstrengthen  ongoing  energy  efficiency  improvement  efforts  and  will  further  intensify  and \ntransform these efforts into sustainable business cases. Thus, these energy managers can form \npart of the permanent solution in mainstreaming energy efficiency policies, and can ensure \ncontinued improvement within industrial enterprises, which will ultimately contribute towards the \nachievement of provincial targets for the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 and beyond. An \naudit by the SPG found that the people who are currently performing these tasks are not trained \nand can contribute only marginally to adding any value to the enterprise. At present, no formal \ntraining is offered in Shandong or nationally for energy managers. Energy manager qualification \nfocuses on building expertise in several areas, including codes and standards, air quality, a \nrange of industrial systems, energy audits, procurement, and financing. Establishing an energy \nmanager training (EMT) program center will encourage individuals3 to obtain a cohesive formal \n                                                 \n1  Based on the readiness of the SPG and the pressing need for the establishment of an energy manager training \nprogram, the project team agreed to decouple the TA from the ensuing loan. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 March 2011. \n3  It is preferable that participants in the energy manager training program are drawn from workers who are already \nemployed within the energy management sector; however, once established, this center can provide postgraduate \ncourses and training. \n ", "2   \nqualification on energy management systems (EMSs), and encourage organizations to hire \nsuch individuals, who can help improve the energy efficiency of operations. \n \n4.  Both the central government and the SPG have recognized that their development \napproaches  must  be  converted  into  a  low-carbon  paradigm,  mainly  by  improving  energy \nefficiency, diversifying the energy supply mix through the integration of renewable energy, and \ncontrolling pollution emissions. Having qualified energy managers and targeted key energy \nefficiency and emission reduction technologies will lead to improved air quality for all and \nenhance the chances of achieving the PRC's overarching goal of building a harmonized and \nenvironment-friendly society by 2020, thus making tangible contributions toward combating \nclimate change. \n \n5.  The  SPG  has  done  some  initial  investigation  work  on  existing  barriers  to  energy \nconservation and emission reduction investment in five energy-intensive industries in Shandong \nprovince\u2014electricity, cement, steel, ammonia, and coal. The TA aims to expand on this initial \ngroundwork and will provide practical solutions in terms of training energy managers for the \nfuture and will, at the same time, promote key energy efficiency technologies especially in these \nfive energy-intensive industries.  \n \n6.  The SPG has set an energy efficiency improvement target of 17% per unit of gross \ndomestic  product  for  its  12th  plan.  The  TA  will  directly  support  the  government's  energy \nefficiency improvement plan. Lessons learned from the establishment of an EMT program in an \nenergy-intensive province such as Shandong may be replicated by involving representatives \nfrom interested provinces within the PRC in the pilot training program under the TA. \n \n7.  The TA is consistent with the following ADB strategies and policies: (i) Strategy 2020, \nwith a strategic priority of environmentally sustainable growth;4 (ii) country partnership strategy \nfor the PRC, with a strategic pillar of resource efficiency and environmental sustainability;5 and \n(iii) Energy Policy, with a priority of energy efficiency and environmental protection.6 The TA \nsupports ADB's Clean Energy Program to expand investments in clean energy projects by \ndeveloping a knowledgeable workforce which can promote and implement energy conservation \nin energy-intensive industries.7 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be an improved EMS in Shandong province. The outcome of \nthe TA will be qualified energy managers overseeing energy efficiency measures in selected \nindustries in Shandong. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008.

Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will (i) recommend a provincial organizational system and regulatory framework \nfor energy management in Shandong through an analysis of current energy management roles \nand  regulatory  structure  and  evaluation  of  energy  efficiency  and  emission-reduction \ninterventions; (ii) recommend an EMT program for energy-intensive industries in Shandong; and \n(iii) strengthen capacity and information dissemination in EMSs, including an energy manager \nprogram at various levels of the SPG and in selected industries in Shandong. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,200,000 equivalent. It is proposed that ADB \nprovide $1,000,000 equivalent on an untied grant basis from the Multi-Donor Clean Energy \nFund8 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, to be administered by ADB. The \ngovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  $200,000  equivalent  through  in-kind  contributions, \nincluding  providing  data  and  other  information  needed  for  the  TA,  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation and facilities, and transportation for site visits as required. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The Shandong Provincial Finance Department (SFD) will be the executing agency and \nthe  Shandong  Economic  and  Information  Technology  Commission  (SEITC)  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The SFD will provide policy guidance, oversight, and coordination while \nthe  SEITC  will  (i)  supervise  the  TA  implementation,  (ii)  ensure  that  the  TA  achieves  the \nexpected outcome, and (iii) disseminate and promote the TA outputs. The SEITC will undertake \nthe selection of consultants, oversee the day-to-day implementation of the TA activities, and \nprovide logistical support to the consultants. This TA will be carried out as a delegated TA under \nthe  agreement  between  ADB  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance.9 Procedures  for  the  hiring  of \nconsultants will be undertaken based on procedures required by ADB and in close cooperation \nwith ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office. For this purpose, capacity assessment has been \nundertaken jointly with the Central Operations Services Office to evaluate the SFD\u2019s capacity to \nundertake the operation of the delegated TA.10 Counterpart staff, office accommodation and \nfacilities, and transportation for site visits, as required, will be provided by the SFD and SEITC. \nAvailable data and other information needed for the TA, as well as guidance on the design of \nthe EMT, will also be provided. \n \n12.  The TA will require a total of 10 person-months of international consulting services and \n31 person-months of national consulting services. The outline terms of reference for consultants \nis in Appendix 3. As a delegated TA, the experts will be engaged by the SFD through a \nconsulting firm using simplified technical proposal procedures based on the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method (with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20) and in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Survey and system \ndevelopment services will be included as part of the consultant's contract. Procurement of \nequipment, supplies, and materials by consultants under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \n                                                 \n8  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n9  A memorandum of understanding on Enhanced Partnership on Technical Assistance Delegation to the Executing \nAgency between ADB and the Ministry of Finance was signed in November 2009. \n10 The capacity assessment found that the implementing agency has experience in ADB- and World Bank-financed \nTA projects. However, it has limited direct experience in the procurement of consulting services and will need \nstrong support from ADB during implementation of the TA. \n ", "4   \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment purchased under the TA will be \nturned over to the SFD after completion of the TA. The SFD, with inputs from the consultants, \nwill finalize the scope and content of the training and information dissemination programs. \nFinancial  arrangements  for  the  training,  workshops,  and  surveys  will  be  included  in  the \nconsulting firm\u2019s contract. Disbursements under the TA will be conducted in accordance with the \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 18 months beginning in June 2011, with an \nexpected completion date of December 2012. The consultant will submit (i) an inception report \nwithin 1 month; (ii) three components of the interim draft report within 5, 6, and 12 months; (iii) a \ndraft  final  report  within  13  months;  and  (iv)  the  final  report  within  14  months  of  the  TA \ncommencement date. A consultation workshop will be held on the draft final report covering all \naspects of the TA deliverables and will be presented to policy makers and stakeholders. The \ncomments from the workshop will be incorporated into the final report for the TA. Information on \nthe  progress  of  implementation  and  on  TA  outputs  will  be  disseminated  through  regular \ncommunications with the SFD and scheduled workshops. Two groups will be trained on the TA \noutputs: (i) the trainers who will be trained to deliver EMT for future energy managers, and (ii) \nvolunteers from participating selected energy-intensive industries who will receive pilot training. \nA  final  workshop  will  be  conducted  to  share  and  disseminate  the  TA  outputs  with  other \nprovinces. The outcome of the TA will be subject to evaluation by both ADB and the central \ngovernment in accordance with their respective evaluation policies and requirements. \n \nIV.
