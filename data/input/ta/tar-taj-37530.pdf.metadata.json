The  Government  of  Tajikistan  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare the rural development project to increase the productivity of farms \nand nonfarm enterprises within an environmentally sustainable management framework. The \nTA is included in ADB\u2019s country assistance strategy and program for 2005. A fact-finding \nmission visited Tajikistan on 15\u201323 November 2004 to formulate the TA with the Government. \nThe TA1 framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Tajikistan has continued its path of economic growth and macroeconomic stability, with \naverage annual growth of 9.5% since 2000, and 10.6% in 2004. As a result of this growth, policy \nreforms, and favorable economic environment, poverty is estimated to have declined from 82% \nin 1999 to 64% in 2003, based on $2.15 per day poverty line. \n   \n3.  Tajikistan is an agricultural economy. The sector has consistently grown at an average \nannual rate generally equal to or exceeding national economic growth. It accounts for 20% of \nthe gross domestic product (GDP), employs about 52% of the labor force, and accounts for \nabout 11% of export revenues (2003).  \n \n4.  About 70% of the population lives in rural areas and relies mainly on agriculture for its \nlivelihood. Poverty has declined mainly in the cotton-growing areas and has fallen only slightly in \nother rural areas. It remains widespread and inequality is worsening. The average per capita \nincome is about $170 per year and the average household spends up to 90% of its income on \nfood. Overseas jobs continue to be an important means of livelihood for many households.  \n \n5.  The  crop  and  livestock  subsectors  continue  to  experience  substantial  adjustments. \nCotton, wheat, potato, and vegetable production have increased by over 50% since 1999, while \nfruits have increased marginally by 14%, and grapes have declined. While cotton, grain, and \npotato yields have increased by over 50%, with vegetables by about 46%, average yields are \nstill low and do not compare favorably with world averages. The low yields are attributed to: (i) \ndeteriorating  soil  conditions;  (ii)  limited  availability  of  quality  agricultural  inputs;  (iii)  lack  of \nfinance for investment and working capital; and (iv) lack of private sector involvement. Livestock \nhas performed less well, with production increasing about 18% since 1999. Only dairy cattle and \ngoats have exceeded 1991 production levels. \n \n6.  Subsistence  farming  has  increased  in  importance  as  the  key  source  of  food  and \npotential livelihood for many farmers, particularly in non-cotton-growing areas.  Small-scale \nprivate  farms  produce  much  of  the  food  supply.  Development  of  cereals,  potatoes,  other \nvegetables, and fruits has become increasingly important as a source of income for the poor. \nHowever, the food supply is inadequate: wheat production (730,000 tons) falls short of the 1.0 \nmillion to 1.3 million tons needed annually; food prices are increasing (wheat flour by 67%, rice \nby 70%, and bread by 103% since 2001); and average per capita food intake has decreased \nfrom 2,615 kcal (1985) to 1,528 kcal (2003). Most households have a monthly income per capita \nbelow the cost of the minimal monthly food basket of TJS32 per capita. Hence, long-term food \nsecurity  is  not  guaranteed.  Nevertheless,  households  are  adapting  to  the  changing \ncircumstances  and  there  is  increasing  evidence  of  an  entrepreneurial  spirit  among  some \nhouseholds, farmers, and rural businesses.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 18 October 2004. ", "2   \n7.  While agriculture is contributing to the economy, it is underperforming and therefore is \nnot significantly reducing rural poverty. The main factors inhibiting more effective agriculture \ngrowth and development of rural areas include the following: (i) land is in various stages of \nprivatization, with inadequate allocation and registration of rights, and people are now free to \nchoose how land is used; (ii) farm productivity is generally low and unprofitable; (iii)  irrigation \nsystems continue to deteriorate; (iv) soil degradation (declining soil fertility, increasing salinity, \nwaterlogging, etc.) is serious and increasing; (v) deforestation has accelerated; (vi) availability of \nand access to finance is limited; (vii) farm machinery is obsolete, inadequate for the changing \nmanagement and size of farms, and rarely in working order; (viii) agricultural research and \nextension  and  statistical  information  services  have  shrunk  substantially,  are  generally \nineffective, and do not address the needs of emerging private farms in a market-oriented \neconomy;  (ix)  marketing,  both  domestic  and  export,  is  severely  constrained  by  numerous \ninformal trade barriers, generally weak demand for food in a largely subsistence economy, and \npoorly understood functions of organizations and personnel that manage market structures; \n(x) the vocational education system does not offer the formal and informal training needed by \nfarmers and small businesses, many of whom have limited business experience; (xi) livestock is \npredominantly raised by households, mainly for subsistence, and is constrained by lack of \nmarkets  and  land  for  fodder  and  grazing;  (xii)  value-added  agroprocessing  is  limited; \n(xiii) coordination  among  public  sector  agencies  remains  limited,  as  does  their  capacity  to \nimplement or enforce reforms and project activities; (xiv) the sector employs more than half of \nall women in rural areas, since a substantial proportion of the men migrate to Russia to work, \nbut they are underrepresented in decision making, access to land, and training programs; (xv) a \nnew system of services, based on private ownership and market principles, is emerging slowly, \nbut new institutions are slow to develop in the absence of an enabling business environment, \nfinance, farm profitability, and demand for inputs and services; and (xvi) the Government is \nincreasingly devolving functions and responsibilities to local government and communities (e.g., \nirrigation rehabilitation), but not all have the resources and skills for decentralization to be \neffective. \n \n8.  Development assistance is generally increasing in agriculture and rural development, \nparticularly  from  international  donors  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  ADB\u2019s \nassistance to agriculture and rural development has been diverse, largely in the cotton sector, \ndrainage  and  irrigation  rehabilitation,  rural  finance,  and  emergency  assistance  and  related \ninstitutional developments. These activities have usually been in many locations. \n \n9.  The number of agencies and scope of activities have expanded in recent years. The \nmain agencies include the World Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) , the European Union, the Aga Khan Foundation, the Food \nand  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO)  of  the  United  Nations,  as  well  as  bilateral  agencies, \nincluding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Government of \nGermany, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the United Kingdom \nDepartment for International Development (DFID), and NGOs. NGOs are moving away from \nhumanitarian to development assistance in agriculture, microcredit, social services, and other \nrelated areas in rural development. The combined efforts of these agencies are helping the \nGovernment address the challenges above. However, to increase its effectiveness and impact, \nparticularly in reducing poverty, development assistance needs to be more focused and better \ncoordinated and to address priority issues and constraints. \n \n10.  A  more  holistic  and  coordinated  approach  is  proposed  to  address  problems  and \nconstraints,  enhance  opportunities,  and  integrate  agriculture  more  effectively  into  the  rural ", "      3\neconomy  through  a  coherent  rural  development  framework  or  strategy.2  This  will  involve \nidentifying  priority  development  opportunities  for,  issues  related  to,  and  constraints  on  the \ndevelopment  of  agriculture  and  its  integration  into  rural  development.  This  will  entail  an \nincremental and sequential approach with realistic expectations of achievements. Increased \ncoordination and cooperation among the development community and government agencies at \nall levels through adherence to the strategy will be important. \n \n11.  The TA proposes to pilot an integrated area-based approach comprising a number of \ncontiguous raions (districts). This approach will initially develop a clear, realistic, and prioritized \nstrategy  that  will  increase  the  productivity  of  farms  and  nonfarm  enterprises  within  an \nenvironmentally sustainable management framework, and increase the scope and depth of \neconomic opportunities for farm and nonfarm rural residents. This approach, with the support of \nthe Government and the donor community active in the area, will improve the coordination of \ndevelopment activities, efficient use of resources, and effective implementation and monitoring \nof development activities; generate economies of scale for marketing and processing activities; \nmore effectively stimulate and encourage private sector development through farmers\u2019 groups, \ncooperatives, and private companies; and provide a more dynamic environment for piloting and \nimplementing policy, legislation and regulations, and institutional mechanisms.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA will help the Government design an investment project to provide an integrated \napproach to agriculture and rural development. \n \n13.  The TA will have two phases. The key output in phase I (3 months) will be a broad \nstrategic plan to develop the selected area and identify investment activities to be funded by \nADB. The strategy will cover policy, legal, institutional, and investment aspects. Phase II (5 \nmonths) will produce a detailed feasibility study for the project, and institutional and monitoring \nand evaluation mechanisms to implement the strategic plan and project activities.  \n \n14.  The geographical location for the project will be agreed on at the beginning of the TA, \nbased on selection criteria to be agreed on with the Government. These criteria will include \ncontiguous raions, non-cotton-growing areas, potential for crop diversification, reliable road \naccess, high population density, poverty incidence, interest and capacity of local governments, \nand potential agreement among NGOs and donor partners to participate.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will be implemented through a participatory approach from the national to local \ngovernment level and include the private sector (agricultural and nonagricultural business), \ndonors,  NGOs,  civil  society,  and  farmers.  The  participatory  approach  will  be  implemented \nthrough the TA steering committee, raion-level working groups, stakeholder workshops, focus \ngroup interviews, and the social analysis survey in the selected area. \n \n16.  The activities in phase I will be: (i) an analysis of the growth and development of the \nselected area; (ii) an assessment of the key issues, constraints, opportunities, and priorities for \n                                                 \n2  It is understood that DFID with the participation of UNDP are planning a rural development strategy for the \nZarafshan Valley in 2005. ", "4   \nagriculture  and  rural  development;  (iii)  a  review  and  mapping  of  existing  and  planned \ngovernment,  donor  partner,  and  NGO-supported  activities  against  the  constraints  and \nopportunities; (iv) an assessment of private sector activity in on- and off-farm enterprises and of \npotential  for  development;  (v)  an  institutional  analysis  of  the  capacity  of  local  government \nagencies; (vi) preparation of, and agreement between governments (national and local) and \ndonor and NGO partners and communities to, the strategic plan; and (vii) identification of the \nbroad investment activities to be funded by ADB. Phase II will prepare a detailed feasibility \nstudy  that  will  include  (i)  key  investment  activities;  (ii)  institutional  development  activities; \n(iii) clearly identified links to existing or planned investment activities of the government, donor \npartners, NGOs, and the private sector; and (iv) institutional, and monitoring and evaluation \nmechanisms to implement the broader strategic plan and project activities. Phase II will also \npresent plans for (i) strengthening community involvement in design and implementation and \nlinks to local government, (ii) mainstreaming gender aspects during project implementation, and \n(iii) developing capacity to enhance community participation. \n \n17.  The project impact is increased scope and depth of economic opportunities for farm and \nnonfarm  rural  residents.  The  outcome  is  increased  productivity  of  farms  and  nonfarm \nenterprises  within  an  environmentally  sustainable  management  framework.  The  potential \noutputs could include rural infrastructure, agricultural support services from input supply to \nmarketing, private sector support for agribusiness development and agroprocessing, diversified \nlivelihood development activities, sustainable land management, institutional development, and \nsupport to microfinance. The project will complement other ongoing and proposed agriculture \nand  rural  development  activities.  Consideration  will  be  given  to  a  grant-financed  TA  to \nstrengthen local government agencies in rural development.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,032,000 equivalent, comprising $644,000 in \nforeign exchange cost and $388,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The TA will be financed \nby ADB\u2019s TA funding program in the amount of $700,000 and the remaining $150,000 on a \ngrant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund and administered by ADB. ADB will \nfinance  $700,000  equivalent  consisting  of  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $206,000 \nequivalent in local currency cost. The Government will provide $182,000 equivalent as office \naccommodation, counterpart staff, and transport, data collection, and logistics support. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. The project is expected to obtain \nfunding of up to $17.12 million equivalent over 6 years, comprising $8.77 million in loan funds \nand $8.35 million in grant funds. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) will be the Executing Agency (EA), and will appoint a \nsenior official as TA director to coordinate, guide, and supervise the consultants. A project \nworking group will be chaired by MOA, with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, \nMinistry of Economy and Trade, State Committee for Nature Protection and Forestry, State \nCommittee for Land Management, Tajik Academy of Agricultural Sciences and other national \nagencies, the oblast (region) and raion governments, and donor partners and NGOs.   \n \n20.  The TA will be undertaken over 8 months in two phases and is expected to begin in \nAugust 2005 and be completed in March 2006. About 76 person-months of consulting services \n(22 international and 54 domestic) will be required. The international experts will include a team ", "      5\nleader\u2013economist\u2013planner,  institutional  development  specialist,  agriculture  economist, \nenvironmentalist,  sociologist,  and  others  as  needed.  The  domestic  experts  will  include  an \neconomist\u2013deputy  team  leader,  institutional  specialist,  rural  engineer,  rural  sociologist, \nagribusiness specialist, environmental specialist (sustainable land management), agriculture\u2013\nlivestock specialist, and others as needed. The services of a firm will be engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB \nfor engaging domestic consultants. A simplified technical proposal using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedure will be adopted for recruiting the consulting firm. The consultants will \nprocure computer and other approved equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nProcurement. The equipment will be transferred to MOA at the end of the TA. An initial poverty \nand social impact assessment of the project is in Appendix 4. \n \n21.  Several participatory workshops will be held to strengthen the participatory approach. \nWorkshops will be held at the start of phase I to review the agriculture and rural development \nsituation, and at the end of phase I to discuss and agree on the strategic plan and the potential \nproject. Only when agreement is reached will phase II commence. Workshops at the local \ngovernment and community levels, and including donor partners, NGOs, and the private sector, \nwill continue to formulate the project design and ensure ownership of and agreement to the \ndetailed design and implementation arrangements. \n \n22.  Inception, phase-I, interim, draft final, and final reports will be prepared. Tripartite review \nmeetings will discuss their findings and recommendations. All reports will be in English and \nRussian, and, where appropriate, summarized in Tajik. \n \n23.  The Government will provide: (i) administrative assistance to the consultants to help \nthem fulfill their terms of reference; (ii) all relevant documents and information available to \nagencies within the government; (iii) adequate office space with appropriate furniture; (iv) local \ncommunications facilities and direct access to international communications facilities (the cost of \ninternational communications will be borne by the consultants); and (v) counterpart staff to work \nwith the consultants. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved: (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $150,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, and (ii) ADB providing \nthe balance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of \nTajikistan for preparing the Rural Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance   Data Sources/  Assumptions \nTargets/ Indicators  Reporting  and Risks \n  Mechanisms   \n \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nProductivity of farms  Crop yields of farms  National Statistics  The project design is \nand nonfarm  increase1  Office regional data  implemented \nenterprises increased      effectively. \nwithin an  Profitability of farm and  Project survey of farm   \nenvironmentally  nonfarm enterprises  and nonfarm  The Government and \nsustainable  increase1  enterprises  the Asian Development \nmanagement    Bank (ADB) sign the \nframework  Turnover of nonfarm  loan agreement. \n  enterprises increase1 \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nProject design and  Memorandum of  Consultants\u2019 final  Effective stakeholder \nfeasibility study  understanding (MOU) of  report,  participation and \nagreed on by the  final tripartite meeting  MOU,  ownership are \nGovernment and ADB  signed by the  back-to-office-report of  developed. \n  Government and ADB  final TA review   \n  mission  Risks \n \nMost partners do not \nfollow the strategy. \n \nGovernment priorities \nchange. \n \nThe Government seeks \nother funding sources. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.

The technical assistance (TA) will have two phases. In phase I, the state of agriculture \ndevelopment in the selected raions (districts) will be comprehensively reviewed to identify major \nissues  related  to,  constraints  on,  and  opportunities  for  further  agriculture  growth  and \ndevelopment.  Institutional  and  financial  analyses  of  the  region's  administration  and,  where \nnecessary,  of  districts,  villages,  farmers\u2019  organizations,  and  other  relevant  agencies  will \ndetermine their capacity and strategic needs for assistance. Ongoing and planned development \nactivities by the Government, private sector, and funding agencies will be reviewed. A rural \ndevelopment framework or strategy will be prepared for the selected area and agreed on with \nthe Government, donor partners, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), the private sector, and \ncommunities. Alternative approaches to addressing issues, constraints, and opportunities will be \nassessed and key areas for Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance identified. In phase II, \nthe project will be designed, taking account of the findings in phase I; the reassessment of the \nalternative approaches; and policy, technical, economic, financial, social, environmental, and \ninstitutional aspects.  \n \nA.  Phase 1: Review of the Selected Area \n \n2.  The  review  of  the  districts  can  be  based  largely  on  existing  reports  and  project \ndocuments and should include one or more workshops with the Government, private sector, civil \nsociety, and donor partners. \n \n3.  The analysis of the overall growth and development of the region and districts will cover \n \n(i)  the macroeconomic and sectoral context of the selected area, with attention to \nthe  constraints  identified  in  para.  7  of  the  TA  paper,  and  drawing  on  the \neconomic and sector work of ADB and other agencies; \n(ii)  growth and development of each area, based on national and regional statistics; \n(iii)  the  progress  of  agricultural  reforms,  and  identify  any  major  constraints  on \nimplementation, and additional reforms to facilitate the transition to a market-\nbased agriculture sector; \n(iv)  the  achievements  of  regional  development  efforts  by  local  governments,  the \nprivate sector, and funding agencies;  \n(v)  the  socioeconomic  situation,  and  identify  major  economic  and  social  issues \naffecting the rural population, with attention to women and vulnerable groups, \nand the effects of farm restructuring, reduction of social services, and access to \nresources (including land) and infrastructure; and \n(vi)  an assessment of rural\u2013urban linkages. \n \n4.  The assessment of development in agriculture will address \n \n(i)  the ownership and structure of farms in the region and factors influencing the \nsuccess of private farming, and identify constraints that inhibit the improvement \nof farm productivity and profitability, by farm type, farm size, ownership, land, \nlabor and capital availability, output, productivity, and net income, disaggregated \nby farm enterprise and, where applicable, by gender; \n(ii)  the market potential for the area, competitiveness of the products, potential for \nincreased competitiveness, and constraints on achieving this competitiveness, \nincluding a comparative advantage analysis of the project area;  \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n(iii)  availability  of,  and  farmers'  access  to,  input  supplies,  technology,  finance, \nmarkets  and  marketing  facilities  and  channels,  extension  and  research,  and \ntransport  and  distribution  networks,  with  major  constraints  and  opportunities \nidentified; and \n(iv)  the links between agriculture and the broader rural economy. \n \n5.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Republic of Tajikistan: \n \nTajikistan is agricultural, with about 70% of the population in rural areas and relying mainly on agriculture for its \nlivelihood. In 2003, 70% of the rural population was below the poverty line, a decline from 81% in 1999. The decline \nwas more prevalent in the main cotton-growing areas and fell only slightly in other rural areas. However, the Gini \ncoefficient indicates a worsening of inequality, increasing from 0.33 in 1999 to 0.36 in 2003. Poverty remains \nwidespread. The average per capita income is about $170 per year, and the average household spends up to 90% of \nits income on food. Overseas jobs continue to be an important means of livelihood for many households. An estimated \n1 million people (15% of the population) live in households whose main source of income is derived from a family \nmember working abroad.3 Remittances increased from $65 million in 2002 to $202 million in 2003. \n \nSubsistence farming has increased in importance as the key source of food and potential livelihood for many farmers, \nparticularly in non-cotton-growing areas.  Small-scale private farms produce much of Tajikistan\u2019s food. Growing \ncereals, potatoes, and other vegetables, and fruits has become increasingly important as a source of income for the \npoor. The food supply is inadequate. Wheat, the staple crop, is grown on 35% of the irrigated area, but the total \nproduction of about 730,000 tons falls short of the 1.0 million to 1.3 million tons needed annually. Food prices are \nincreasing, with wheat flour rising by 67%, rice by 70%, and bread by 103% since 2001. Average per capita food \nintake has also decreased from 2,615 kilocalories (kcal) (1985) to 1,528 kcal (2003). Most households have a monthly \nincome per capita below the cost of the minimal monthly food basket of TJS32 per capita. Hence, long-term food \nsecurity is not guaranteed.  \n \nPoverty in Tajikistan is non-income-based, characterized by a worsening human development situation caused by the \nlack of essential services, and increasing economic and social disparities that particularly affect women.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                         Proposed Poverty Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \n  The technical assistance (TA) will require a poverty analysis that is disaggregated by raion (district) and by gender. \nThe geographical area is still to be selected by the Government and agreed to by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). This will be done when the TA begins. It will look at the incidence of poverty using existing data sources and \na social survey of potential beneficiaries. Income and non-income poverty indexes  will be determined. The analysis \nwill be carried out following the Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis and Handbook for Integrating Poverty \nImpact on Economic Analysis of Projects. Particular attention is to be given to profiling the beneficiaries, including \ngender-disaggregated demographic, economic, and social data where possible, plus the incidence of poverty, \nvulnerable groups, and any adverse impacts anticipated from the project.  \n \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nA stakeholder analysis will be prepared as part of the TA. Several participatory workshops will be held to strengthen \nthe participatory approach. A workshop will be held at the start of phase I to review the agriculture and rural \ndevelopment situation. A second workshop will be held at the end of phase I to discuss and agree on the strategic \nplan among stakeholders and ADB\u2019s proposed investment project. In phase II, workshops at local government and \ncommunity level will continue to formulate the project design.
