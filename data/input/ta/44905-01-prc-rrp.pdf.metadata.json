BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n2. Background.  The PRC has abundant undeveloped indigenous natural gas reserves, \nestimated at approximately 2.46 trillion cubic meters (tcm) in 2009, 2  which have significant \npotential to mitigate global climate change, address regional environmental concerns such as \nacid rain, and increase energy security. The Government of the PRC aims to reduce coal \nconsumption and increase usage of natural gas, a cleaner fue1, 3  from its current share of 4% of \nenergy consumed to 10% by 2020. \n3. To achieve this target, the government has restructured its largest gas producing \ncompanies and implemented a program of large-scale international and domestic trunk pipeline \nnetworks, such as the Central Asia pipeline and the West\u2014East pipelines. The development of \ndownstream gas distribution infrastructure is, however, still a bottleneck to the scaling up of the \nnatural gas market. A number of municipalities have faced shortages of natural gas over the last \nseveral years. Most affected are newly emerging small and medium-sized \"satellite\" cities on the \noutskirts of medium-sized and large \"hub\" cities which are not connected to natural gas pipeline \nnetworks.4  \n4. Shortly after an acute natural gas shortage in the winter of 2009, 5  ADB held discussions \nwith China Gas Holdings Limited (CGH), which had implemented the Municipal Natural Gas \nInfrastructure Development Project (Phase 1), 6  to provide through public-private partnerships \n(PPPs) approximately 200 million cubic meters (mcm) of natural gas per annum to industry and \ncommercial users and 1.3 million domestic households, and to introduce compressed natural \n1 \n Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n2  BP plc. 2010. BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2010. London. \n3  One million cubic meters (mcm) of natural gas can replace 1,350 tons of coal consumption. \n4  The Urban Planning Law of PRC issued on 26th December 1989 by the National People's Congress defines a city \nwith a nonagricultural population in urban and suburban districts of not less than 500,000 as a \"large-sized city\", a \ncity with nonagricultural population in urban and suburban districts of less than 500,000 but not less than 200,000 \nas a \"medium-sized city\", and a city with a nonagricultural population in urban and suburban districts of less than \n200,000 as a \"small-sized city\". \n5  In the winter of 2009, natural gas supplies were diverted to northern PRC to support snowstorm recovery. As a \nresult, many municipalities faced their worst natural gas shortage in years. \n6  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Equity Investment \nand Loans to the People's Republic of China for the Municipal Natural Gas Infrastructure Development Project. \nManila. On 30 August 2006, the Board approved (i) an equity investment of up to $25 million equivalent in Hong \nKong dollars in CGH; (ii) an A-loan of up to $50 million equivalent, of which up to 50% was to be in US dollars and \nthe balance in yuan; and (iii) a B-loan of up to $75 million to Zhongran Gas Industrial (Shenzhen) Limited and ZIL, \nfully owned PRC subsidiaries of CGH. The B-loan was subscribed among 12 banks through successful syndication. ", "2 \ngas (CNG) for buses and taxis in northern, central, and western PRC. ADB played a catalytic \nrole not only in the total financial plan by satisfying equity and US dollar and yuan loan \nrequirements and mobilizing additional funds from international banks to finance phase 1, but \nalso in improving corporate governance,  7  developing a formal environmental and social \nmanagement system, and enhancing the institutional capacity. \n5. To date, CGH's network coverage has been limited to regional hub cities. To seize \nbusiness opportunities through expanded market coverage, and also with the intention of \nfulfilling social responsibilities, CGH applied for further ADB assistance to extend additional \nnatural gas pipelines to satellite cities to ensure stable supply. Through its due diligence \nprocess, ADB has determined the proposed project embodies ADB's strategies in terms of \nenvironmental sustainability, inclusive growth, financial and technical feasibility, potential for \ncarbon reduction, and demonstration impact. \nB.  Sector Background \n6. Demand and Supply.  Historically, a significant demand\u2014supply gap in natural gas has \nbeen observed in the PRC. Given future needs, and compounded by the PRC's increasing role \nin global efforts to combat climate change, the demand for natural gas is expected to grow \nfurther. Natural gas consumption in the PRC in 2007 was 69.5 billion cubic meters (bcm), of \nwhich the residential sector accounted for 19.2%, the commercial sector 2.5%, the industry \nsector 68.1%, and the power generation sector 10.2%. Consumption increased by 31% to 91.0 \nbcm in 2009, and it is estimated to reach 105-110 bcm in 2010. Nevertheless, per capita gas \nconsumption in the PRC is still among the lowest in gas-consuming countries in Asia and the \nrest of the world. Recent studies estimate that annual natural gas consumption will grow to \naround 210 bcm by 2020, which implies a 7%-8% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). \nPer capita consumption in 2020 is estimated at 150 cubic meters (m 3), which is more than \ndouble the level in 2008 but still below current levels in Pakistan and Indonesia, and less than \none-tenth of the average in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \ncountries. \n7. Supply has been a key constraint on the growth of the PRC natural gas market. This  is \nbeing addressed with a broad-based supply development program encouraged by the \ngovernment. Annual natural gas supply is expected to grow to 208-275 bcm by 2020, with an \n8%-11% CAGR, to consist of domestic production (65.9%), pipeline imports from Central Asia \n(12.7%) and Myanmar (2.5%), and imported liquid natural gas (LNG, 18.9%). Domestic natural \ngas reserves are located mainly in Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and \nXinjiang, far from consumption centers. Lack of a transmission pipeline network has been a key \nconstraint on connecting these supplies to ready markets. Implementation of the West\u2014East \nPipeline8(WEP) has enhanced domestic natural gas production, which has almost doubled in \nthe past 5 years from 51 bcm in 2005 to approximately 95 bcm in 2010. Since 2010 the PRC \nhas also started importing gas by pipeline. The Central Asia pipeline, which runs 1,800 km from \n7 \nDuring the phase 1 due diligence, ADB identified that CGH's corporate governance was one of the key areas \nwhere ADB could add value. ADB obtained the right to nominate a person to be appointed as a nonexecutive \ndirector on the CGH board throughout the period that ADB holds equity shares. In addition, ADB negotiated with \nCGH to comply with international best practices in corporate governance and also undertake the corporate \ngovernance improvement program as a covenant in the loan agreement. In recognition of the effort over years to \nenhance corporate transparency and responsibility, CGH received various awards in corporate governance. \n8 The West\u2014East Pipeline is a 3,900 kilometer (km) trunk line with 12 bcm of capacity and 10 pipeline \ninterconnections; a second and third phase will bring total capacity to 72 bcm by 2014. Other large projects will \nsupply gas from production centers in central and southern PRC. Official plans envision the PRC's gas pipeline \ngrowing from 32,000 km at the end of 2008 to 60,000-70,000 km by 2015. ", "3 \nTurkmenistan through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to the PRC, will expand capacity from 6 bcm \nin 2010 to a potential 30 bcm by 2012. There are planned pipeline imports from Myanmar (6 \nbcm) and potentially eastern Russia (up to 70 bcm). \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n8.  ADB's long-term strategic framework 2008-2020 (Strategy 2020) 9  emphasizes support \nfor achieving poverty reduction and inclusive growth through environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment and private sector development. The project is consistent with the strategy, which \nidentified infrastructure and environment as two of the five core areas in which ADB will employ \nits financial and institutional resources to maximize results, efficiency, and impact. In terms of \ninfrastructure, specifically energy, the project will embody the strategy, which sets forth that \nADB will (i) help expand the supply of energy; (ii) promote energy efficiency through supply-side \nand demand-side measures; (iii) support clean energy; and (iv) facilitate the removal of policy, \ninstitutional, regulatory, technological, and legal constraints on promoting efficient energy use. \nWith respect to the environment, the project is in line with the strategy's focus on climate change, \nlivable cities, and complementary actions. The strategy also aims to promote a larger role for \nthe private sector in financing infrastructure by supporting PPP. \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n9. ADB's country partnership strategy for the PRC is based on four development pillars: (i) \ninclusive growth and balanced development, (ii) resource efficiency and environmental \nsustainability, (iii) regional cooperation and public goods, and (iv) an environment conducive to \nprivate sector development.10  The project will be an integral part of ADB's PRC country strategy \nand will complement ADB's overall support for urban development in the PRC through \ninvestment projects and knowledge products. In particular, the project benefits from public \nsector operations in environmental protection of urban centers, 11  and municipal infrastructure \ndevelopment in small cities and towns.12  \n10. The PRC has been steadily turning to market-oriented and private-sector-led \ndevelopment, which has become the driving force for economic growth and job creation. ADB's \nprivate sector operations in the PRC have focused on infrastructure, energy, finance, and \nenvironmental improvement, which are built upon ADB's public sector's policy advice to the \n9  ADB. 2008.

Regarding infrastructure and energy, ADB \nprioritizes pioneering projects with innovative contractual and financial structuring to encourage \nprivate sector participation, enhance management expertise, and improve corporate \ngovernance. \n3.  Consistency with the Energy Policy \n11. ADB's Energy Policy 13  requires energy operations to be aligned with ADB's overall \nstrategy of emphasizing energy security, facilitating a transition to a low-carbon economy, \nuniversal access to energy, and achieving ADB's vision of a region free of poverty. The policy \nrequires ADB to help developing member countries provide reliable, adequate, and affordable \nenergy for inclusive growth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way. It \nsets out three pillars for policy implementation: (i) promoting energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy; (ii) maximizing access to energy for all; and (iii) promoting energy sector reform, \ncapacity building, and governance. The proposed project is in line with the policy, as further \npenetration of natural gas will contribute to promoting energy efficiency and enhanced access to \nclean energy. \nIll.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n12. The project is the second phase of ADB's intervention to address the financial \nconstraints on developing natural gas transportation infrastructure, which is the key obstacle to \nnatural gas market development in the PRC. The project will build on and expand the network \ninto satellite cities on the outskirts of cities where CGH currently operates natural gas \ndistribution services with the assistance of ADB under phase 1. The project will support CGH in \nbuilding a series of pipeline networks and making gas connections to domestic household, \ncommercial, and industrial end users in central and western regions 14  of the PRC. ADB's loan \nwill be channeled to subproject companies through ZIL, a wholly owned subsidiary of CGH. \n1.  The Sponsor and Borrower \na.  Sponsor \n13. CGH, the sponsor and guarantor of the ADB loan, is one of the main private natural gas \ndistribution companies in the country and owns one of the largest pipeline networks. Following \nthe government's policy to introduce the private sector to the natural gas distribution sector in \n2002, CGH builds and operates downstream natural gas distribution, supplying residential, \nindustrial, and commercial end users with gas to replace the use of coal and coal gas. Where \nappropriate, CGH builds CNG refilling stations for vehicles to replace gasoline. In FY2009, CGH \nentered the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution business to be an integrated gas \ndistribution company. CGH operates in a business environment in which it has an extremely \nstrong franchise and customer base due to its exclusive market position in municipalities that \ncover around 4% of market share in the PRC. CGH is underpinned by strong technological \ncapabilities; a competitive edge in competitive procurement, facilities, and maintenance services; \n13 ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n14 The central and western regions include Shanxi, Inner-Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, \nHenan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Chongqing, Sichuan ,Guizhou , Yunnan, Tibet, Shan'xi, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang \nand Qinghai, in accordance with the official definition in the Catalogue of Priority Industries for Foreign Investment \nin Central and Western China (2008) issued jointly by the Ministry of Commerce and the NDRC.

Its \nmain shareholders are presented in Table 1. \nTable 1: China Gas Holdings Limited Shareholders \n(%) \nShareholders  Share \nXu Xau Lan  18.6 \nOman Oil Company S.A.O.C.  7.1 \nHai Xia  6.8 \nChina Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec)  6.2 \nGAIL (India) Limited  6.2 \nAsian Development Bank  4.5 \nOthers  50.6 \nTotal  100.0 \nSource: China Gas Holdings Limited Annual Report 2010 and ADB. \n14. CGH's board comprises 13 members: five executive directors and eight nonexecutive \ndirectors including three independent nonexecutive directors. CGH has approximately 16,000 \nemployees, almost all of whom are located in the PRC. \nb.  Borrower \n15. The borrower of ADB's loan will be ZIL, 16  a wholly owned subsidiary of CGH. ZIL was \nestablished as a PRC investment holding company with approval from the Ministry of \nCommerce in 2006. \n2.  Project Design \n16. The project is designed to be a least-cost solution to achieving energy and \nenvironmental objectives. Natural gas distribution infrastructure in satellite cities tends to be \nsma11,16  and thus involves relatively high transaction costs for financing. ADB and CGH aim to \nfinance a series of small subprojects on a consolidated basis to reduce financing transaction \ncosts. To ensure affordability, a TA component (paras. 36-39) aims to assist in developing \nenergy efficiency solutions to enable natural gas to compete with coal. \n17. CGH is responsible for identifying, evaluating, selecting, negotiating, implementing, and \nadministering all subproject companies. For each municipality, a special-purpose subproject \ncompany will be set up with project equity from ZIL. The operation and maintenance (O&M) of \neach subproject will be undertaken by in-house engineers trained by CGH. The key personnel \nof the O&M team will be seconded from CGH, which has expertise in gas distribution operation. \n18. The project puts its geographic focus on the central and western regions, where (i) the \nobstacles are more prominent due to underdevelopment of infrastructure, (ii) an untapped \nmarket for natural gas distribution exists, and (iii) gas supply from the West\u2014East pipeline phase \n2 and/or Central Asia pipeline is available. Despite the benefits of proximity to natural gas fields, \naccess to clean energy is limited since the municipalities tend to lack capital and operational \n15 ZIL i s also the borrower of the ADB phase 1 loan. \n16 An average satellite city would have a total population of around 500,000, total connectable urban population of \n300,000, 3 potential industrial users, 50 potential commercial users, and 1 CNG station to service the city taxi and \nbus fleets. ", "6 \nknow-how. In 2008 the per capita nominal gross domestic product of the provinces of the initial \ntarget cities were $2,629 in Shaanxi, $2,525 in Hunan, and $2,156 in Guangxi, significantly \nbelow the national average of $3,315 and approximately half the levels in affluent provinces \nsuch as Jiangsu or Guangdong.17  \n3.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n19.  The project outputs will be (i) creation of subproject companies in small and medium- \nsized cities and (ii) construction of gas distribution networks and facilities. The TA outputs will be \n(i) documented integrated energy saving solutions for residential, commercial, and industrial \nusers, and (ii) training provided to CGH management on combining fuel conversion and energy \nefficiency. Some of the subproject companies will undertake pilot cases to promote energy \nefficiency solutions. \n20.  The project's outcome will be to provide residential, industrial, and commercial \nconsumers with a clean, reliable, and long-term energy source in a financially and \nenvironmentally sustainable manner. The design and monitoring framework is presented in \nAppendix. \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n21.  The project contributes to the PRC's efforts to promote the use of natural gas to \nenhance energy diversification and address environmental degradation. The project will provide \nresidential and commercial users with clean and reliable energy for cooking and heating. It will \nalso substitute natural gas for coal, oil and coal gas for industrial users, and thereby contribute \nsignificantly to reducing air pollution. The reduction of particulates and sulfur dioxide (SO ) from \n2\nindustries and households will abate urban environmental degradation and have the most \nbeneficial impact on the urban population, in particular the urban poor, who suffer severely from \nindoor and outdoor air pollution. 18  \n2.  Private Sector Development \n22.  The project supports the government's strategy of encouraging private sector \nparticipation in the municipal natural gas distribution sector, given the substantial investment \nrequired in expanding the natural gas pipeline network and the limited self-financing capacity \nand operational know-how of the municipalities. The project demonstrates a robust and efficient \nmodel for private sector participation in natural gas supply and other municipal environmental \ninfrastructure through the PPP model in small and medium-sized cities in the relatively \nunderdeveloped central and western regions of the PRC, given the substantial capital required \nin implementing municipal environmental infrastructure and the limited self-financing capacity of \nthe municipalities. \n3.  Economic Sustainability \n23.  The economic benefits of the project are significant. The expected project economic \ninternal rate of return is 21%. \n \n17  National Bureau of Statistics. 2009.  China Statistical Yearbook 2009. Beijing. \n18 Compared with coal on an energy-equivalent basis, natural gas combustion releases 44% less carbon dioxide, \n88% less nitrogen oxides, and almost 100% less SO2. ", "7 \nC.  Environmental and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environmental Safeguards \n24. The project will contribute to improved urban air quality and health in the PRC and \nreduced emissions of air pollutants, including greenhouse gases. The anticipated environmental \nimpacts of construction of the subproject pipelines are low, short-term, and localized, and can \nbe mitigated through sound engineering practices. The size of the citygate station is limited \n(requiring less than 0.5 hectares [ha] of land) and potential pollution is small in scale. Emissions \nare expected to be minimal from these facilities, except for occasional gas flaring. The project is \ntherefore categorized B. Consistent with the PRC safeguard requirements, each subproject is \nrequired to prepare an environmental impact assessment or initial environmental examination in \naccordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for submission to ADB together with \nthe annual monitoring report. \n25. For the phase 1 project, government environmental clearances were secured prior to the \nstart of construction of the facilities. Phase 2 subprojects will also comply with such \nrequirements and submit environmental impact assessment or initial environmental examination \nreports to ADB and the government for approval. A safeguard audit report on phase 1 facilities \nprepared by a staff consultant indicated cleanness and prudent management on site. Noise \nbarriers are installed where necessary to minimize impacts to the community near the gas \ncompression facility. Pipeline repair works were undertaken during the nonpeak hours or in the \nnight to minimize inconvenience to road users. Truck drivers have gone through strict safety \ntraining for CNG transport where pipelines are not connected. \n26. A corporate-level environmental and social management system (ESMS) was adopted \nby CGH in May 2010 as an updated and integrated system developed from an environmental \nmanagement system and resettlement framework during phase 1, and training and awareness \nbuilding exercises have been ongoing with staff at both corporate and site levels. The ESMS \nhas heavy focus on safety and emergency response (to accidental fire  or explosion of the gas \npipes and facilities), which is embedded in the Corporate Standard Safety Management Code, \nwhile an emergency response plan has become a part of the ESMS and is considered adequate. \n2.  Social Safeguards \n27.  The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement, as land requirements for \ngas distribution infrastructure are likely to be limited and resettlement is usually carried out by \nthe municipal government. With respect to indigenous peoples, the project is classified category \nC since the project will be implemented in mainly medium-sized cities and no impacts specific to \nethnic minorities are expected. As mentioned in para. 26, a corporate ESMS has been adopted \nby CGH. While the overall project impact is expected to be positive, potential limited involuntary \nresettlement impacts of each subproject company will be dealt with according to the \nresettlement planning policy within the corporate ESMS. The resettlement planning policy \ndetails the process on procedure for screening, conduct of socioeconomic survey, delivery of \ncompensation, consultation and disclosure, provision for grievance redress, monitoring and \nevaluation, and, lastly, provision for needed resources and institutional arrangements. CGH, \ntogether with the relevant subproject companies, will ensure that all land acquisition and \nresettlement activities are undertaken in accordance with the ESMS to ensure compliance with \nADB requirements on social safeguards. The ESMS also includes work processes and \nprocedures for the conduct of social assessment, preparation of resettlement plans, public \nconsultation and disclosure, and monitoring and reporting arrangements. ", "8 \nD.  Financing Plan \n1.  Project Cost \n28.  CGH's investment plan indicates a total investment requirement of $400 million and \nincludes civil works, equipment and materials, other local procurement, and working capital for \nmunicipal natural gas distribution subprojects in approximately 24 satellite cities surrounding 8 \nhub cities from FY2011 to FY2013. Each subproject is estimated to cost around CNY100 million \n($15 million). For each subproject, CGH will require about 1 year to complete the natural gas \nreceiving station at the city gate, which will require about 30%  of the total capital expenditure \namount. In the following year, CGH will construct pipeline networks covering major connectable \nareas, which will require about 70% of total capital expenditure. \n2.  Financing Plan \n29.  ADB will provide ZIL with a credit line up to $200 million to fund a series of new \nmunicipal natural gas distribution subprojects in CGH's investment plan. Proceeds from the ADB \nloan will be channeled to subproject companies through ZIL. This broad portfolio approach will \nenable ADB to provide financing support for multiple gas distribution subprojects that are too \nsmall for ADB or international banks to finance on a stand-alone basis. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Development \n30.  CGH centrally controls all project development, procurement, and financing \narrangements across its operations. To mitigate the risks associated with the unique aspects of \ndifferent local markets, and to mobilize more equity funding, CGH intends to make its \ninvestments through subproject companies with local partners. In the case of brownfield \nsubprojects where natural gas or coal gas distribution infrastructure already exists, the local \npartner (usually the municipal government or government-owned company) contributes the \ninfrastructure and other assets in exchange for the share in the new subproject company. \n2.  Anticorruption Policy \n31.  CGH and ZIL were advised of ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand the policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). ZIL has \nfully complied with the policies under phase 1. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require ZIL to institute, maintain, and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \nthe purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism \nand covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. Such obligations shall be \ncontained in the loan documentation, which will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n3.  Project Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n32.  During project implementation, ADB will receive reports regularly on project financial and \noperational indicators, as well as other information to be agreed between ADB, CGH, and ZIL. \nReporting will include, among other things, (i) the financial statements of ZIL, (ii) calculations ", "9 \nand compliance certificates of the financial covenants, (iii) the business plans of CGH and ZIL, \n(iv) reports on the status of gas pipeline construction, (v) the number of end users by segment, \n(vi) the amount of natural gas sold, (vii) operation and maintenance costs and other \nadministrative costs, and (viii) the maintenance plan for the next year. ADB will conduct annual \nreviews to monitor environmental and social safeguard requirements, credit assessments, and a \nreview of development impacts, among other things. \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n1.  Loan \n33. ADB's proposed loan will have two tranches: an A-loan of up to $100 million funded by \nADB, and a B-loan of up to $100 million funded by commercial banks, both to be made to ZIL, \nand supported by an unconditional, irrevocable guarantee from CGH. The A-loan will carry an \ninterest rate, as well as commitment and front-end fees, as approved by ADB's Investment \nCommittee. \n34. The B-loan of up to $100 million will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the \nA-loan and be on terms and conditions agreed upon by the borrower and participating banks, \nwith the concurrence of ADB. ADB may charge an arrangement fee and an annual \nadministration fee as approved by its Investment Committee. The B-loan syndication will be \nundertaken on a best-efforts basis. \n35. During the life of the loans, the subproject companies, the borrower, and CGH will be \nbound by financial and operational covenants stipulated in the loan agreement, including regular \nfinancial and operational monitoring  reports and requirements to meet minimum financial ratios. \n2.  Technical Assistance \na.  Impact, Key Activities, and Output \n36. In municipalities, natural gas connection offers a stable and clean fuel option that brings \nsubstantial benefits to both industry and residential households. However, connections tend to \nbe limited to large industry users and high-end residential apartments that can afford the upfront \ncapital expenditure of conversion from coal to gas. Coal is widely available at low cost, and is \nthus still a popular fuel option among a wide range of energy users. \n37. Natural gas can be more competitive if appropriate energy efficiency measures are \nproperly introduced. The primary objectives of the TA are to enhance the affordability of natural \ngas and thereby encourage replacement of coal in the cities where the project is to be \nimplemented. This will be achieved through educating the end users and delivering integrated \nenergy efficiency solutions. CGH as the sponsor of the project can  be an effective agent and \naggregator for systematically marketing and delivering energy efficiency to a large untapped \nsegment of energy end users. This wholesale approach will enable ADB to provide technical \nsupport for a large number of energy efficiency projects which are often too small to support \ndirectly. ", "10 \nb.  Cost and Financing \n38.  The TA is estimated to cost $662,000 equivalent, of which $592,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility, and administered by ADB. CGH will finance the remainder, equivalent to \n$70,000, through in-kind contributions, including office accommodation and facilities, \ncounterpart staff, and data and information collection. \nc.  Implementation Arrangements \n39. ADB, as the implementing agency for the TA, will be responsible for all technical \nimplementation issues, but with the full support and cooperation of CGH. Consulting services \nrequired for the TA include 12 person-months of international consulting and 40 person-months \nof national consulting. A consulting firm will be selected using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method with simplified technical proposals. The recruitment of the firm will be in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). TA disbursements will be  made in accordance  with ADB's  Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010). \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n40. ADB's assistance is justified based on the project's development impacts and \ndemonstration effects. It will support the government's development plan and ADB's operational \nstrategies. ADB's participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n(i) The project will provide access to a clean, reliable, and long-term energy source \nto people in emerging satellite cities where adequate municipal natural gas \ninfrastructure is lacking and demand is unmet. \n(ii) The project will demonstrate the commercial viability of natural gas distribution in \nsmall and medium-sized cities. CGH's business model\u2014to extend its operations \nto satellite cities on the outskirts of its existing service areas, combining energy \nefficiency and fuel conversion to ensure affordability for further inclusive \npenetration\u2014is innovative. CGH can leverage its existing pipeline networks to \nextend gas distribution and address demand for access to clean energy in \nemerging satellite cities. \n(iii) The project supports the government's strategy of encouraging private sector \nparticipation in the municipal natural gas distribution sector, given the substantial \ninvestment required in expanding pipeline networks and the limited self-financing \ncapacity of the municipalities. \n(iv) The project is in line with ADB's long-term, PRC country, energy, and private \nsector operations strategies. The project will complement ADB's ongoing public \nsector operations in urban environment improvement. The project aims to \naddress the financial constraints on developing natural gas transportation \ninfrastructure, which is the key obstacle to natural gas market development in the \nPRC. \n(v) The project reflects a continuation of ADB's effort to set more transparent \ncorporate governance, environmental management, and together with the TA on \nenergy efficiency will ensure the long-term sustainable growth of CGH and set \nstandards in the industry. \n(vi) The project is demonstrational and catalytic as long-term US dollar funding for a \nseries of small subprojects in the underserved central and western regions of the ", "11 \nPRC where foreign investment is limited. Under PPP arrangements, increasing \nnumbers of municipal governments require private sector partners to fund project \nequity in hard currency. However, the availability of long-term loans to finance \nproject equity,  in  US dollars in particular, is limited. As a multiproject facility, the \nproject will enable ADB to extend its reach to small and medium-sized cities that \nwould be difficult to assist directly. ADB assistance will also play a catalytic role \nin mobilizing other commercial financing through the B-loan. \nC.  Assurances \n41. Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, the \ngovernment has been requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance \nto ZIL. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will enter into \nfinance documents acceptable to ADB following the approval of the proposed financing by the \nBoard of Directors. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n42. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, under the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan to Zhongran Investment Limited (ZIL), consisting of (i) an A-loan of up to \n$100,000,000 to be provided from ADB's ordinary capital resources, carrying an interest rate, as \nwell as commitment and front-end fees, as approved by ADB's Investment Committee; and (ii) a \nB-loan of up to $100,000,000 to be funded by commercial banks, on terms and conditions \nagreed by ZIL and the commercial banks, with the concurrence of ADB, for the Municipal \nNatural Gas Infrastructure Development Project (Phase 2) in the People's Republic of China, \nand on such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin this report and as may be reported to the Board. \nC.
