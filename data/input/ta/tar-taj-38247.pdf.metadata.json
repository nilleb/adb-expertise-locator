During the 2005 Country Programming Mission, the Government of Tajikistan asked the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to facilitate improvements \nin local government budgeting and participation of civil society in the budget process in selected \nareas of the country. The TA is included in the 2005 country program and is consistent with the \nfindings of the Country Governance Assessment.1 A reconnaissance mission visited Tajikistan \nfrom 31 January to 6 February 2005, and a fact-finding mission from 12 to 14 July 2005. The \nmissions met with officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), development partners, program \nimplementers working on local government issues, representatives of local government and civil \nsociety in two raions,2 and key stakeholders to discuss TA formulation and implementation. An \nunderstanding  was  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Tajikistan has an average of 64% of households living under the poverty line and an \naverage per capita annual income of less than $300. With available government funding having \ndeclined by over 80% since 1991, the use of any and all government funds has to be carefully \nrationalized to make services effective. This is especially true in the raions, where government \nactivities are implemented and funding is particularly scarce. Little information is available and \nmuch confusion exists over what resources are\u2014or should be\u2014actually made available for local \ngovernments. Thus poorer households, and particularly women within these households, can be \ndeprived of access to essential services simply because the community lacks understanding of \nwhat funds are available and how they can be used. \n3.  The  system  of  revenue  and  expenditure  is  centralized,  controlled  by  the  national \nGovernment,  which  uses  a  calendar  year  input-based  budgeting  system.  Raions  receive \nvirtually all their resources from the national budget for local government operations and all \ninfrastructure and social services. They have little scope to raise revenue locally, although they \ncollect taxes on behalf of the national Government. The budget process starts in April, when the \nraions generate very detailed input-based applications generated based on historical costs and \nlocal priorities. For raions under oblasts, the oblast reviews, revises, and amalgamates the \napplications before submitting them to the national Government in July. The Government then \nreviews  them  within  the  context  of  national  Government  plans,  priorities,  and  resource \navailability. Resource allocation to the raions is based of historic raion operational costs and \nnational  planning  objectives.  The  budget  is  finalized  in  November  with  the  Parliament\u2019s \napproval.4 The allocations are then revised as they progress through the oblasts to the raions, \nand the raion operates based on what it receives. The final budget may bear little to no relation \nto the original submission. The budget process involves little matching of national and local \npriorities, and few discussions on what the revised final budgets mean in terms of expected \nprogram implementation. Funds are not matched to expected results.  \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004.  Country Governance Assessment: Republic of Tajikistan. Manila. \n2  Muminabad and Vakhdat districts. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 16 May 2005. \n4  Of the 62 raions, 5 are under the central Government, the remaining are under the four oblast governments. In \naddition, 23 cities are under one of the three levels of subordination (raion, oblast, or national). ", "2     \n4.  In each raion the rais, appointed directly by the President, heads the local government \ncouncil, which approves the local budget. This approval occurs after the budget has been \nhanded down by the  oblast or national Government, and is not linked to a detailed local \nplanning  process.  Citizens  generally  lack  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  aspects  of  local \ngovernment budget formulation or monitoring. The final budget is handed down for de facto \napproval, with little room for modification or discussion. While a summary budget is made \navailable in the press, few people are knowledgeable about the details of the full budget. Public \nunderstanding of or incentive to monitor the inputs is minimal, and the lack of output targets \nmeans citizens do not know what goods and services can be expected from the government.  \n5.  The raions\u2019 needs are too great to be fulfilled by any reasonable standard.5 Therefore \nthe focus is essentially on financing salaries for health and education (70\u201380% of total funds) \nwith the residual funds allocated to essential supplies. Available resources are widely viewed as \ninadequate for even the most essential supplies. Some efforts are made to mobilize additional \nlocal resources, bring in funds from aid agencies, and improve management of existing funds. \nHowever, local governments largely lack adequate knowledge or capacity to use budgeting and \nexpenditure techniques that offer greater simplicity in resource monitoring, as well as encourage \nmore effective fund use to serve local needs and national priorities. \n6.  The nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) \nworking on local governance issues can be classified in three categories: (i) organizations \nlegally registered as NGOs operating with some degree of international technical and financial \nsupport and engaged mostly in sector work; (ii) CBOs operating as part of the normal fabric of \nlocal governance structures throughout all of Tajikistan, including parent-teacher committees \nassociated  with  local  schools,  and  mahalla  and  village  committees;  and  (iii)  a  variety  of \ncommittee structures created as part of internationally supported local governance programs, \norganized for collective decision making on the use of aid-provided resources. NGOs tend to be \nmore aware of gender issues and to employ and involve women in their activities. Any of these \nthree  types  of  NGOs  can  work  effectively  on  local  government  budget  dialogue  and \nenhancement, but this is not yet an area where they are engaged to any significant degree.  \n \n7.  Development partners have been particularly active in the area of local government \nreform, and closely coordinate their work. Most aid projects have as their objective the building \nof local government and civil society capacity to collaborate in defining priorities and in planning \nand  implementing  local  development  projects.  Some  programs  involve  setting  up  parallel \ndevelopment committees with their own resources. Others focus on local government and \nnongovernment leadership, with intensive training in areas such as strategic planning and \nbusiness development. A third program works intensively with selected local governments, \nprimarily  cities,  in  the  delivery  of  municipal  services  promoting  more  effective  subnational \nbudget  management  and  greater  civil  society  participation.  The  significant  gap  is  capacity \ndevelopment for MOF, NGOs, and local governments so they may jointly engage in better local \nuse of national budget resources. What is missing are the resources and advice to enable such \njoint engagement on local budgeting. \n \n8.  Key stakeholders advised that the TA can make the most appropriate contributions by \nundertaking the following: \n \n(i)  Focus  on  the  existing  budget  process  and  develop  capacity.  Using  an \nincremental  approach,  the  TA  proposes  to  start  by  improving  the  quality  of \n                                                 \n5  MOF indicates that the submissions from raions and oblasts request between six and seven times the available \nfunds from the budget each year. \n ", "  3\nexisting local budget submissions through training and technical assistance. It \nwill improve communications and overall working relationships between local \ngovernment  administrations,  civil  society,  and  MOF.  Engagement  with  the \noblasts will be critical to ensure support for raion improvements. \n \n(ii)  Gradually  improve  the  budget  formulation  process.  Once  all  parties \nunderstand the existing process, they can then provide advice on how to improve \nit. The focus will be on (a) strategic prioritization of expenditures given realistic \nbudget constraints, (b) options for additional local revenue mobilization and use, \nand (c) consideration of basic principles of output-based budgeting so this shift \ncan begin.  \n \n(iii)  Engage civil society with local government in considering the budgeting \nproblems, to ensure joint solutions. The TA proposes to provide capacity \ndevelopment for local government and civil society representatives in budget \nprocesses, and to facilitate ongoing discussions between the rais, local council, \nbudget officers, oblast, and civil society groups including women. Civic education \nprograms will help people see how budgeting works. Brainstorming sessions can \nallow both sides to better understand the needs and motivations of government \nand civil society. Capacity development for local councils and the formation of \ninterested citizen committees for public hearings throughout the year will support \ngreater  engagement  in  budget  formulation  and  implementation.  Active \npartnerships in budget processes between local governments and NGOs will \nencourage realism and trust. Increased capacity provides options for ongoing \nenhancements  to  the  overall  budget  and  expenditure  process,  including \nspreading  of  the  new  process  to  adjoining  raions  and  implementation  of \nrecommendations that come out of this TA for national budget improvements. \n \n(iv)  Make  budget  use  more  transparent  to  everyone.  The  TA  proposes \nexamination of current reporting processes for both revenues and expenditures. \nThrough a process of review by local government and civil society, partners can \ndefine and implement improved budget development and reporting alternatives \nthat are more transparent and understandable to both women and men. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA outcome will be a raion budget funding and expenditure system that reflects \nexpressed priorities of local citizens. The expected impact is that additional raions will choose to \nshift to this improved budgeting system, incorporating successful output-based submissions, \npublic consultation, and reporting to the public on budget requests, approvals, and utilization. \nThe TA will result in MOF accepting a higher percentages of submitted budgets in the target \nraions (taking into account that budget submissions will be formulated on the basis of greater \nrealism and a sounder analytical basis); a jointly determined budget based on CBO and local \ngovernment collaborative processes; higher citizen awareness of and agreement with budget \npriorities, expenditure levels, and local budget uses; and a model that MOF and the target \nraions successfully share with other raions for implementation.  ", "4     \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will install an improved budget submission and reporting process, establish and \noperationalize a joint CBO-local government budget consultation structure, and enable MOF \nand raions to share learning and new processes with other raions. \n \n11.  Key activities under the budget submission and reporting improvement output include \nthe following: \n(i)  Establish a set of selection criteria, and decide on final raions and NGOs for \nparticipation.  \n(ii)  Complete a participatory, institutional baseline review of the four raions. \n(iii)  Implement an MOF training program for local government budgeters and CBO \nstaff in each raion.  \n(iv)  Facilitate local development of key aspects of effective budget management.  \n(v)  Develop  and  implement  improved  systems  of  raion  budget  development  in \ncooperation with civic groups, oblasts, and MOF.  \n(vi)  Support  a  local  assessment  of  current  financial  reporting  on  budget \nimplementation,  and  assist  finance  officials  in  extending  formal  coverage  of \nbudget  reporting  for  both  nationally  and  locally  sourced  revenues  and \nexpenditures. \n \n12.  Key activities under the consultation structure output include the following: \n(i)  Implement a civic education program on budgeting processes.  \n(ii)  Provide capacity building for local councils.  \n(iii)  Support a budget committee drawn from interested and capable local citizens.  \n(iv)  Facilitate the conduct of public hearings on the budget.  \n(v)  Improve  budget  documentation  for  public  communications,  reviewing  and \nmodifying budget documentation for dissemination to the media and public.  \n \n \n \n13.  Key activities under the sharing of learning output include the following: \n(i)  Develop a list of concrete recommendations for improvement of the national \nbudgeting process. \n(ii)  Document training and other requirements needed to develop this budgeting and \nexpenditure monitoring process in other raions. \n(iii)  Present findings to meeting of raion heads, and identify a new set of interested \nraions for expansion of the new system. \n(iv)  Facilitate discussions with locally based NGOs and other development partners \non how to support expansion of this process with interested raions.  \n(v)  Provide  results  in  a  final  national  workshop,  and  to  international  program \nwebsites. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $825,000 equivalent, comprising $297,000 of \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $528,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide \n$700,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $403,000 equivalent of local \ncosts.  The TA  will  be cofinanced on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Governance  Cooperation  Fund \n($500,000) and ADB\u2019s TA funding program ($200,000). ADB will administer the TA funds. The \nGovernment will provide $125,000 equivalent to cover in-kind counterpart costs and services, \nincluding  provision  of  necessary  data,  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and  administrative \n ", "  5\nsupport (equivalent to about 15% of the total TA cost). The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The MOF Budget Office, in cooperation \nwith the Independent Commission (IC) and relevant raion government offices, will provide office \nspace,  basic  furnishings,  telephones,  counterpart  staff,  local  transport  as  appropriate, \nsecretarial support, and related services to consultants; and will arrange appointments for them \nwith relevant agencies and organizations. Under TA financing, MOF will provide direct training \nof budget officers and CBO representatives for the four raions and related oblasts based on \nmodifications of existing training to be worked out with the consultants. MOF will also arrange \nrelevant computerization at their offices and in the raions. The TA will be implemented over 2 \nyears from November 2005 through October 2007, to ensure two budgetary cycles, to allow \ntesting of changes and enhancements. Close cooperation with the raion governments will be \nrequired.  \n \n16.  The TA will engage one individual international consultant (local government budget \nspecialist) for 8 person-months and an NGO to provide domestic consultants for 96 person-\nmonths.  The  domestic  consultants  will  include  a  budgeting  and  expenditure  monitoring \nspecialist (24 person-months), a civil society consultation specialist (24 person-months), and \nothers to be proposed by MOF in consultation with the local government budget specialist \nfollowing the selection of the four participating raions and prior to shortlisting. Separate budgets \nare provided to engage resource persons to participate in training and seminars. The terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The international consultant will be selected and \nengaged on an individual basis, and the NGO will be selected following the quality and cost-\nbased  selection  method  using  the  simplified  technical  proposal,  in  accordance  with  ADB \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Preferred NGOs could be (i) an international NGO with \noperations in Tajikistan, (ii) a local NGO with international experience, or (iii) a consortium of \ninternational  and  domestic  NGOs  led  by  an  international  NGO  in  Tajikistan.  Equipment \n(notebook and stand-alone computers, software, computer battery backups, data transfer sticks, \nfacsimile machines, and photocopiers) will be procured by MOF and retained by MOF and \nrelevant raion budget offices after TA completion in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  The  advance  payment  facility  procedure  will  be  adopted  to  facilitate  timely \norganization of training, seminars, and conference activities. \n \n17.  Separately, the international consultant and the NGO will submit under their respective \ncontracts (i) inception reports 2 weeks after their services start, (ii) interim progress reports at \nappropriate stages of TA implementation, (iii) draft final reports before the conclusion of the \ncontract, and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after incorporating MOF and ADB comments.6 \n \nIV.
