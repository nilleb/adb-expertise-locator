THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  Sri Lanka\u2019s health system today is facing challenges to sustain its performance due to \nrapidly changing demographics and epidemiological transitions. In particular, the cost of health \ncare has been increasing due to the sharp rise in noncommunicable diseases linked to lifestyles \nand rapidly aging population. The national health system also needs to further improve to \nexpand services to vulnerable populations with lagging health indicators. In addition, there is \nincreased threat of emerging and resurging infectious diseases linked to environmental factors \nand increased cross-border migration. The status quo of the health system is inadequately \nprepared to deal with these evolving challenges without significant reorientation and further \nimprovements. The proposed assistance will enhance the Sri Lanka health system to adapt to \nemerging  challenges  and  deal  with  shifting  disease  burdens.  It  is  included  in  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)\u2019s Sri Lanka country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022.1 \n \nB.  Proposed Solutions \n \n2.  The  proposed  solutions  will  further  enhance  the  health  system  through  support  for \nstrengthened primary health care, and improved health and disease surveillance capacity. The \noutputs are as follows: \n \n3.  Output  1:  Primary  health  care  strengthened,  especially  in  lagging  areas. \nInvestments  will  indicatively  target  four  provinces  with  underserved  communities,  namely \nSabaragamuwa, Uva, Central, and North Central provinces, where estate and chronic kidney \ndisease of unknown etiology (CKDu)-affected communities are present. Support for primary \nhealth care (PHC) in these provinces will focus on strengthening primary care services and \ncommunity-based preventive health services to reach vulnerable areas. \n \n4.  Output 2: Health and disease surveillance capacity improved. This component will \nsupport  health  system  resilience  against  emerging  and  resurging  infectious  diseases.  Key \ninvestments  will  align  with  forthcoming  recommendations  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Joint  External \nEvaluation of International Health Regulations (2005) core capacities.2 \n \n5.  Output 3: Policy development supported. The output will support (i) further policy \ndevelopment in PHC reform and health care rationalization (linked with Output 1), including \npossible  packaging  of government  reform  program;  and (ii) project management,  including \nmonitoring, procurement, and financial management. \n \n6.   These  solutions  or  outputs  will  result  in  the  following  outcome:  sustainability  and \nresponsiveness of the health system, especially in lagging areas, enhanced. 3  The project is \naligned with the following impact: a healthy nation ensured.4 \n \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n \n7.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) is required for designing the ensuing project \nand  enhancing  its  readiness  through  appropriate  advance  actions  and  support  for \nimplementation start-up.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n8.  The major outputs will include due diligence assessments covering: (i) review of health \nand disease surveillance system enhancement requirements; (ii) review of key health security \ngaps and measures to strengthen them; (iii) review of human resources for PHC; (iv) primary \nhealth infrastructure and equipment gap assessment; (v) medical equipment gap assessment; \n(vi) review of essential service delivery gaps at primary health level; (vii) review of community \nmobilization and information, education, communication  requirements; (viii) procurement and \ngovernance due diligence; (ix) safeguards due diligence; (x) economic and financial analysis; \n(xi) gender, social and poverty analysis; and (xii) procurement plan, and detailed cost estimates. \n \n9.
