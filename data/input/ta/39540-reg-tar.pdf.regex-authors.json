INTRODUCTION \n1.  Regional cooperation in transport is essential to link the landlocked countries of Central \nAsia closely with neighboring countries and facilitate efficient cross-border movements of freight \nand passengers so as to achieve rapid and sustainable economic development. The Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program, initiated by the Asian Development \nbank (ADB) in 1997, aims to strengthen economic linkages among Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC: Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Transport is one of the priority areas under \nCAREC. Important progress has been made on transport cooperation among CAREC countries. \nThe Transport Sector Coordinating Committee (TSCC) was established in June 2004, a regional \ntransport sector road map for 2005\u20132010 was developed in March 2005, and investments were \nmade to improve regional transport networks. \n \n2.  In accordance with ongoing efforts to support transport cooperation among CAREC \ncountries, ADB includes this regional technical assistance (TA)1 in the 2005 program of its \nCentral  Asia  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2006\u20132008).2 The  TA \nproposal was presented at the fourth TSCC Meeting in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic on 12\u201313 \nOctober 2005. Concurrence was reached with the governments of CAREC countries on the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, cost, financing and implementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 \nterms of reference for the TA. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Central Asia is a historical land bridge between East Asia and Europe, as well as \nbetween South Asia/Persian Gulf and Russia. It also has a potential to become important transit \nroutes between Asia and Europe. However, CAREC countries face daunting challenges in \npromoting  regional  and  international  transit  transport:  regional  transport  networks  are \ninadequate, a large proportion of regional transport infrastructure and facilities are in poor \ncondition due to insufficient funding for maintenance, and nonphysical barriers are becoming \nmajor impediments to cross-border and transit traffic. These challenges need to be addressed \njointly by CAREC countries through close cooperation. \n \n4.  In response to the challenges, CAREC countries established the TSCC in June 2004 to \ncoordinate issues and activities relating to regional transport cooperation. TSCC has adopted a \npragmatic, phased, and results-based approach. It meets twice a year to review cooperation \nprogress and provide guidance on future work as necessary. Four TSCC meetings3 have been \nheld. The Regional Transport Sector Road Map (2005\u20132010) was developed at the third TSCC \nMeeting in March 2005 to guide activities in transport cooperation among CAREC countries. \nThe road map aims to develop an integrated and efficient transport system in CAREC countries \nand  sets  five  strategic  priorities:  (i)  harmonizing  and  simplifying  cross-border  transport \nprocedures  and  documentation,  (ii)  harmonizing  transport  regulations,  (iii)  developing  and \nimproving  regional  transport  corridors,  (iv)  restructuring  and  modernizing  railways,  and  \n(v) improving sector funding and management. TSCC has become an important mechanism for \nplanning, coordinating, and monitoring transport cooperation activities among CAREC countries. \nBecause regional cooperation initiatives are resource-intensive and human resource capacity in \nCAREC countries is limited, support to TSCC is crucial to maintain the momentum of regional \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 15 August 2005. \n2  ADB. 2005. Central Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008). Manila. \n3  The first TSCC Meeting was held in Almaty on 30 June\u20131 July 2004, the second in Almaty on 13\u201314 September \n2004, the third in Bishkek on 1\u20132 March 2005, and the fourth in Bishkek on 12\u201313 October 2005. \n ", "2   \ntransport cooperation and achieve the performance targets of the road map. The TA will provide \nadvisory, financial, and capacity building support to TSCC to sustain its effective functioning. \n \n5.  The CAREC road map identifies the development and improvement of regional transport \ncorridors  as  one  of  the  strategic  priorities.  An  integrated  multimodal  regional  transport \ninfrastructure network will strengthen economic links within CAREC countries, give the countries \nbetter access to outside markets, reduce transport costs, improve transport services and safety, \nand  expedite  cross-border  and  transit  traffic  in  the  region.  This  will  promote  rapid  and \nsustainable development in the nonoil sectors, which will significantly contribute to poverty \nreduction in the region. As part of implementing the road map, the TA will undertake (or update) \nprefeasibility studies on developing and improving three regional transport corridors: Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart\u2013Kashi  road,  Oybek\u2013Pungan  road,  and  Angren\u2013Gulistan  road.  The  corridors  were \nselected in close consultation with the governments of CAREC countries. A brief description of \nthe transport corridors is given in paragraphs 6\u20138. \n \n6.  Bishkek\u2013Torugart\u2013Kashi Road. With a length of 604 kilometer (km) (499 km in the \nKyrgyz Republic and 105 km in the PRC), this road is a potentially important regional transport \ncorridor  linking  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  to  the  PRC.  It  starts  in  Bishkek,  bypasses  Balykchy, \ncrosses the Kyrgyz\u2013PRC border at Torugart, and continues up to about 105 km to connect with \na paved road to Kashi. The first 438 km of the road surface from Bishkek is paved and the \nremainder has a gravel surface. Improving this road, accompanied by simplified cross-border \nprocedures, will enhance regional transport links, promote trade between Central Asia and the \nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of the PRC, and provide an alternative access to South \nAsia from Almaty and Bishkek. A feasibility study on the Bishkek\u2013Torugart section funded by the \nIslamic Development Bank was completed in 1997, and a prefeasibility study on the Balykchy\u2013\nTorugart\u2013Kashi section was completed in 1998 under the European Union-funded Transport \nCorridor Europe\u2013the Caucasus\u2013Asia (TRACECA) program. These studies, however, need to be \nupdated. \n \n7.  Oybek\u2013Pungan  Road.  The  road,  about  220  km  long,  links  northern  Tajikistan  to \nUzbekistan. It provides a short route between the Fergana valley and central Uzbekistan, and \nthus serves as an important section of the east\u2013west transport corridor in Central Asia. However, \nthe road is in poor condition due to of lack of funding for regular maintenance. Improving this \nroad, together with a sound cross-border agreement between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, will \nfacilitate traffic and improve transport efficiency in the region. \n \n8.  Angren\u2013Gulistan Road. This road will form part of the east\u2013west transport corridor in \nUzbekistan  to  link  the  country  more  closely  with  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  on  the  east  and \nKazakhstan on the west. Once constructed, the 150 km new road will enable traffic between \nSamarkand and Osh to bypass Tashkent, thus reducing transport costs and travel time as well \nas alleviating traffic congestion in Tashkent. In the long run, the road can serve as a transit \nroute between the PRC/Afghanistan and south Europe through western Kazakhstan, Caspian \nSea,  and  Azerbaijan.  Developing  this  road  will  strengthen  transport  links  among  CAREC \ncountries and improve their access to neighboring markets. \n \n9.  Promoting regional cooperation and integration is one of the strategic themes under \nADB\u2019s Long-Term Strategic Framework (2001\u20132015).4 Since 1997 ADB has been promoting the \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001. Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank (2001\u20132015). Manila. \n ", "  3\nCAREC Program, together with five other multilateral institutions.5 ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program (RCSP) for CAREC Member Countries6 aims to increase trade and \nintegration with large markets, reduce transport costs and facilitate transit, improve supplies of \nenergy, and tackle negative externalities. Given the landlocked location of Central Asia, the \nlatest RCSP update for CAREC countries reconfirms transport as a priority sector for ADB \nassistance.  ADB  is  the  lead  agency  in  coordinating  transport  cooperation  activities  under \nCAREC and serves as the TSCC secretariat. ADB provided loans for rehabilitating a number of \nregional transport corridors,7 and TAs to prepare investment projects, assess the prefeasibility \nof  developing  the  PRC\u2013Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013Uzbekistan  transport  corridor  and  the  western \nMongolia regional road corridor, as well as undertake studies to harmonize transport regulations \nand  simplify  cross-border  road/rail  transport  procedures  in  CAREC  countries.  Given  that \nmembers of CAREC and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) are largely identical, ADB \nprovided a TA in 2004 to help the SCO countries (i.e., PRC, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nRussian  Federation,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan)  formulate  an  agreement  on  facilitation  of \ninternational road transport, together with support from the United Nations Economic and Social \nCommission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific.8 The  present  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  regional \ncooperation strategy for CAREC countries, and reflects ADB\u2019s continued support for transport \ncooperation under CAREC. \n \n10.  The TA was designed with due consideration of three main lessons learned from the \nCAREC program and the Greater Mekong subregional cooperation program. First, strong and \nsustained commitment of CAREC countries to regional cooperation is key to the TA\u2019s success. \nThe governments of CAREC countries reconfirmed their commitment to regional cooperation \nand agreed at the fourth Ministerial Conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic on 5\u20136 November \n2005 that transport should continue to be one of the priority sectors. The participants in the \nfourth TSCC Meeting supported the TA proposal. The TA is highly relevant and responsive to \nthe needs of CAREC countries. Second, regional cooperation is a long and complex process, so \nconsistent external assistance is needed to address constraints and achieve tangible results \nunder CAREC. The TA is ADB\u2019s first direct support for transport cooperation among CAREC \ncountries. Based on experience gained from the TA, ADB will provide continued assistance for \nregional transport cooperation under CAREC. Third, capacity building for regional cooperation is \nrequired, given the limited institutional and human resource capacities in CAREC countries.  \nThe TA will strengthen the capacity of TSCC, with the objective of building effective institutional \nmechanisms for sustainable transport cooperation in the region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA is facilitation of transport cooperation among CAREC countries to \nachieve sustainable and inclusive economic development in the region. The outcome of the TA \nis  (i)  the  functioning  of  TSCC  as  an  effective  mechanism  for  planning,  coordinating,  and \n                                                 \n5  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Monetary Fund, Islamic Development \nBank, United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. \n6  ADB. 2004.

If the prefeasibility studies show positive results, ADB \nwill consider providing further assistance to prepare and finance investment projects.9 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  is  designed,  and  will  be  implemented,  in  line  with  the  CAREC  Regional \nTransport Sector Road Map (2005\u20132010) and ADB\u2019s RCSP for CAREC countries, as well as in \ncoordination with other regional cooperation initiatives including the Central and South Asia \nTransport and Trade Forum.10 International consultants, with support from domestic consultants, \nwill be engaged to undertake (or update) prefeasibility studies on developing and improving the \nselected transport corridors. During assessment of the viability of these corridors, the consultant \nwill take into account the national transport development strategies in the CAREC countries \nconcerned, or coordinate closely with the consultants working on development of such national \ntransport  strategies.11 The  consultant  will  also  provide  on-the-job  training  to  concerned \ngovernment  officials  in  CAREC  countries  to  build  their  capacity  for  assessing  transport \ninvestment projects. The preparation (or updating) of prefeasibility studies will involve fieldwork, \noffice research, and consultation with various stakeholders including government officials, civil \nsociety, local communities, the private sector, and transport users in the corridor-influenced \nCAREC countries, as well as external development partners.  \n \n13.  Key activities in preparing prefeasibility studies of the selected transport corridors will \ninclude (i) undertaking field surveys; (ii) analyzing data and information collected from field \nsurveys to assess technical and economic viabilities of the selected corridors; (iii) assessing \nsocial,  gender,  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  selected  corridors;  (iv)  holding  public \nconsultations; and (v) preparing a prefeasibility study report on developing and improving the \nselected  corridors.  For  each  selected  corridor,  the  prefeasibility  study  report  will  comprise \nengineering assessment, economic assessment, environmental assessment, social and poverty \nanalysis, and analysis of cross-border issues. An outline of the prefeasibility study report is in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n14.  Key activities under the support of TSCC activities will include (i) facilitating dialogue \namong CAREC countries on transport cooperation issues, (ii) undertaking analytical work in \nsupport of CAREC transport cooperation activities, (iii) supporting the holding of two TSCC \nmeetings each year during 2006\u20132007, and (iv) enhancing dissemination of knowledge and \ninformation on CAREC transport cooperation activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent. The TA will be entirely \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan.  \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.

Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency. ADB\u2019s Transport and Communications Division, East \nand Central Asia Department, will be responsible for administering the TA, with support from \ngovernment agencies in the transport sector in CAREC countries. ADB will collaborate closely \nwith  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  Islamic  Development  Bank, \nUnited Nations Development Programme, World Bank, and other relevant external aid agencies \nduring TA implementation. The TA will be implemented in coordination with other regional \ncooperation initiatives including the Central and South Asia Transport and Trade Forum. The TA \nis expected to commence in January 2006 and to be completed at the end of December 2007. \n \n17.  The TA will require 50.0 person-months of consultant inputs (13.0 international and 37.0 \ndomestic). It will include (i) a consulting firm for 26.0 person-months (13.0 international and 13.0 \ndomestic) to undertake prefeasibility studies on the development and improvement of three \nselected regional transport corridors, and (ii) an individual domestic consultant for 24.0 person-\nmonths to support TSCC activities. The international consultant\u2019s team for the prefeasibility \nstudies will comprise a transport economist/team leader, a road engineer, a social development \nspecialist, and an environment specialist. The international consultants will be supported by \ndomestic consultants with the same expertise. The governments of the CAREC countries to be \ninvolved in the prefeasibility studies (i.e., PRC, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) will \nprovide offices with appropriate furnishings, counterpart staff, and administrative support to the \nconsultants. The individual domestic consultant to support TSCC activities will have experience \nand expertise in regional transport cooperation. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to \nADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. The consulting firm will be recruited \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  using  simplified  technical \nproposals.
