INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Managing for development results (MfDR) is an approach to management that orients \npolicies, institutions, and individuals to focus more on results than activities and inputs. MfDR \napproaches are integral to international efforts to sustain development effectiveness, and the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has funded capacity development on MfDR in Asia and the \nPacific for over a decade. ADB\u2019s action plan on MfDR 2009\u20132011 defines its approach to \nincreasing development effectiveness through MfDR on three fronts: (i) strengthening MfDR \napproaches in developing member countries (DMCs), (ii) mainstreaming MfDR in ADB as an \ninstitution, and (iii) promoting joint MfDR activities with other development partners.1 The action \nplan supports the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness which stresses that the \u2015capacity to \nplan,  manage,  implement,  and  account  for  results  of  policies  and  programs  is  critical  for \nachieving development objectives.\u20162 \n  \n2.  To assist DMCs on MfDR, ADB has supported the Asia\u2013Pacific Community of Practice \non MfDR (APCoP) since 2005. APCoP aims to empower key individuals, working together in a \nnetwork or community of practice (CoP), to act as effective change agents to mainstream MfDR \napproaches into public sector management (PSM) and its functions\u2014planning, budgeting, and \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E). ADB\u2019s initiative in supporting a DMC-oriented regional CoP \nhas been emulated by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank in their \nsupport for regional African and Latin American CoPs. The three regional CoPs coordinate \nactivities through a global partnership on MfDR sponsored by the Development Assistance \nCommittee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. \n \n3.  APCoP  was  launched  under  a  small-scale  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  by  26 \nleading results management practitioners from 11 countries.3 APCoP\u2019s activities are guided by a \ncoordinating committee consisting of senior DMC government officials. Following a 6-month \npilot project, members reiterated their strong commitment to sustain the initiative and requested \nADB to continue support. The regional TA for Community of Practice for Development Results \u2013 \nPhase II was prepared in 2006 and its implementation has seen APCoP grow to 26 participating \ncountries with 700 members.4  The Results Management Unit of the ADB Strategy and Policy \nDepartment is the secretariat, providing technical support, organizing activities, and managing \nthe budget. At the 2009 APCoP annual meeting in Malaysia, members requested ADB to \ncontinue its support. The proposed regional capacity development TA responds to members\u2019 \nrequests that APCoP support be strengthened at the country level. The design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1) reflects lessons learned from the earlier ADB support.5    \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  A  results-based  PSM  system  is  key  to  development  effectiveness  as  it  enables \ngovernments  to  make  informed  decisions  to  sustain  development  outcomes.  Yet  public \nexpenditure reviews persistently highlight weak PSM in DMCs, which constrains the delivery \nand assessment of development initiatives. In addition, PSM capacity development is often \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009. ADB MfDR Action Plan (2009-2011). Manila. \n2  OECD. 2005.

Manila. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 September 2010. \n ", "2   \nshort term and suffers from inadequate attention to (i) the links between the PSM functions of \nplanning, budgeting, implementation, and M&E; (ii) coordination of all functions around shared \nresults; and (iii) coordination across all government institutions around shared results. MfDR \nintroduces features that, when applied to PSM, will enable DMCs to make informed decisions \non future development actions. \n \n5.  Furthermore,  demand-driven  MfDR  capacity  development  initiatives  and  the  use  of \ncountry systems are central to country ownership and hence to the sustainability of outcomes. \nYet, DMCs often see capacity initiatives as supply driven, solely promoting international good \npractices in a \"one size fits all\" approach rather than building on existing country systems. This \nhas frequently resulted in supply-driven initiatives that have been implemented sporadically, \nwith the following consequences for the DMC PSM functions: \n \n(i)  National,  sector,  and  subnational  planning  systems  and  processes  are  not \nintegrated in a results chain with common indicators and targets. \n(ii)  Budgets are focused on inputs, which are insufficiently aligned with the activities \nlinked to the outputs and outcomes from the planning process. \n(iii)  Implementation is not sufficiently focused on priority outputs and outcomes. \n(iv)  Monitoring  is  weak  due  to  inadequate  systems  and  procedures  resulting  in \nunavailable, untimely, or inaccurate baseline and performance data. In addition, \nmonitoring is often limited to tracking procurement and disbursement or collecting \ndata on activities, rather than on indicators to measure outputs and outcomes \nagainst established targets. \n(v)  Weaknesses  in  MfDR  integration  across  the  PSM  functions  of  planning, \nbudgeting, and monitoring hinder effective evaluation that would better inform \nplanning. This makes transparent and evidence-based decision making difficult. \n \n6.  While the TA for Community of Practice for Development Results \u2013 Phase II sought to \nresolve these issues, its design also recognized the importance of a phased approach to ensure \nAPCoP responds to the long-term and varying capacity development needs of its members. A \nreview undertaken in June 2010 noted that the regional TA had successfully delivered all of its \nfour  targeted  outputs,  and  exceeded  expected  performance  in  three  out  of  four  planned \noutcomes.6 The delivered outputs were (i) a sustained and broadened regional APCoP-MfDR \nwith  a  critical  mass  of  practitioners  at  the  working  level;  (ii)  established  country-  and \nsubregional-based CoPs; (iii) publication of MfDR good practice papers and contributions to an \nMfDR sourcebook, and (iv) a regional training hub in results-based monitoring and evaluation. \n \n7.  For outcomes, the regional TA (i) demonstrated that a CoP on MfDR is an innovative \nand  effective  modality,  (ii)  increased  capacity  and  demand  for  MfDR  in  DMCs,  and  (iii) \nincreased dissemination of MfDR knowledge products. The review considered the achievement \nof the fourth outcome\u2014the delivery of strengthened M&E systems in DMCs\u2014would require \nmore interventions that are targeted at the country-level.  \n \n8.  The regional TA developed the capacity of a critical mass of senior government officials \nacross the region as change agents for MfDR. The regional TA successfully increased APCoP \nmembers\u2019 ownership by (i) strengthening the role of the coordinating committee in guiding the \nwork program, (ii) increasing the exposure of members to international best practices, and (iii) \npromoting  peer-to-peer  learning.  It  also  helped  create  knowledge  resources,  such  as \npublications, newsletters, and a website. The APCoP website hosts online discussions and \n                                                \n6  The review is available at http://cop-mfdr.adb.org  \n ", "  3 \nstores information on MfDR and members\u2019 activities and publications. The 2009 APCoP source \nbook, Moving from Concept to Action, has been internationally recognized.7  \n \n9.  To build on past achievement and respond to members\u2019 demands, the coordinating \ncommittee has requested ADB support to expand and consolidate APCoP so that APCoP can \nmore effectively support MfDR mainstreaming and meet the remaining challenges (para. 5). \nMore specifically, the coordinating committee noted the need to supplement regional activities \nwith concrete follow-up actions by members at the country level. This is the key to ensuring that \nresults-based approaches are mainstreamed into the PSM of DMCs in a sustainable manner. In \naddition, the coordinating committee highlighted the importance of (i) reaching out to more \nDMCs not actively engaged in the TA for Community of Practice for Development Results \u2013 \nPhase II; (ii) sustaining the website and knowledge products to record and share best practices \nfor members; and (iii) expanding centers of excellence in the region (beyond the Singapore Civil \nService College and the Shanghai International Program of Development Evaluation Training) \nto provide increased venues for MfDR training and seminars. The coordinating committee noted \nthat, while ongoing capacity development initiatives at the regional level would require continued \nfunding by development partners, demonstrated success in MfDR integration at the country \nlevel should be mainstreamed into country-led initiatives that are self-sustainable. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The desired impact of the TA is to further advance MfDR in countries with APCoP \nmembers. This will be demonstrated by an increased number of participating countries with key \nattributes of MfDR in place over baseline of 2010.  The intended outcome is the increased \napplication of MfDR by APCoP members in their country contexts. The outcome will be seen in \n(i) the increased numbers of members applying MfDR principles and approaches, and (ii) the \nimplementation of plans for the integration of MfDR into PSM. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  This TA supports APCoP members through regional and country activities focused on \nintroducing  results-based  approaches  to  PSM.  Regionally,  the  TA  will  continue  to  support \nmembers through workshops and other training events to share ideas on best practices. At the \ncountry level it will help APCoP members incorporate MfDR into their country PSM systems. To \nachieve its outcome, this TA will deliver four specific outputs: knowledge products on MfDR \ncreated and disseminated, increased MfDR capacity of APCoP members, an expanded APCoP \nmembership, and plans for MfDR approaches in PSM approved by relevant DMC authority. \n \n12.  To develop, create, and disseminate knowledge products, a number of key activities will \nbe  financed  under  the  TA.  Knowledge  products  will  be  distilled  from  the  experience  of \nmembers\u2014captured through summaries of online discussions\u2014and developed as cases from \nworkshop and meeting sessions, as well as experiences with country initiatives. The existing \nAPCoP online virtual resource center will continue to facilitate knowledge storage, sharing, and \ndissemination. Knowledge will also be disseminated through training modules and publications. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n13.  Capacity  development  will  include  virtual  and  face-to-face  support  for  members, \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nworkshops  and  seminars,  online  discussion,  and  targeted  coaching.  The  centers  of \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2009. Moving from Concept to Action. Manila. \n ", "4   \nexcellence\u2014which support knowledge sharing, skills development and peer-to-peer learning for \nthe APCoP members\u2014will be expanded to include the ADB Institute in Japan and training \nfacilities in Malaysia. The TA will promote members\u2019 access to expertise on MfDR in PSM by \nbuilding networks of qualified national, regional, and global MfDR experts. The virtual resource \ncenter  will  continue  as  an  important  vehicle  for  the  members  to  discuss  and  share  their \nexperiences and expertise on MfDR. \n \n14.  The TA will strengthen and broaden the APCoP membership to include a larger number \nof active members. A strong emphasis of the TA for Community of Practice for Development \nResults \u2013 Phase II was to encourage membership from senior government officials who can act \nas change agents for MfDR. The TA will continue to streamline the current membership and at \nthe same time broaden it so that the APCoP membership reflects all of the core functions of \nPSM\u2014planning, budgeting, implementation, and M&E. The TA will reinforce the coordinating \ncommittee\u2019s role by providing a technical coordinator to assist in monitoring feedback from \nmembers on their activities and responding to their needs in the design of regional activities. \n \n15.  The TA\u2019s most significant output will be the country-specific capacity development plans \nto  be  developed  by  members.  Support  for  the  country  initiatives  will  follow  an  innovative \ncountry-based  CoP  approach.  This  bottom-up  approach  will  strengthen  the  ownership, \naccountability, and sustainability of capacity development initiatives. The CoPs will comprise \nsenior government officials from the central (planning and finance) and sector ministries, and \nmay also include technical experts and civil service organizations. Support for the country-\nbased CoPs will bring members together to work on PSM systems and processes identified as \nhampering the effective delivery of the national plan. CoPs will focus on national, subnational, or \nsector PSM issues. They will establish country standards, analyze gaps, and formulate capacity \ndevelopment plans that build on existing country systems and international good practices. For \nexample,  to  strengthen  national  monitoring  systems,  a  cross-sector  CoP  of  government \nindividuals working in monitoring will be supported to formulate the capacity development plan \nfor the national monitoring system. Initial support to implement the plans may come through \nloans and TA from development partners, but longer-term sustainable support is expected \nthrough  the  government's  own  initiatives.  A  country-driven  capacity  development  plan  will \nstrengthen harmonization of capacity development assistance between development partners.  \n \n16.  At  least  four  DMCs  (including  the  following:  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Cambodia,  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Fiji  Islands,  Indonesia,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  Maldives,  Mongolia,  Nepal,  Pakistan,  Samoa,  Sri  Lanka,  Tajikistan, \nUzbekistan, and Vanuatu) will be supported under the TA to work on selected MfDR issues, \nfinancing workshops, and seminars to develop plans. The TA will also support members of \ncountry-based CoPs to interact with the wider APCoP to promote sharing of experiences and \ngood practices. After this initial support, it is expected that the country-based CoP activities will \nbe incorporated into the DMC\u2019s own regular processes. The success of the country-based CoPs \nin promoting MfDR approaches will be documented so that this modality can be replicated by \nother DMCs and other development partners. Robust and results-oriented PSM systems will \nhelp  development  partners  overcome  the  challenge  of  aligning  their  country  development \nstrategies  with  those  of  the  DMC,  and  demonstrating  the  contribution  of  each  partner\u2019s \nstrategies to the DMC national development goals. Written confirmation of no-objection will be \nobtained from the governments of DMCs where CoP-MfDR activities will be undertaken.  \n \n17.  For maximum impact, each of the DMCs supported during 2011\u20132013 will be from a \nsubregional group within Asia and the Pacific. The selected DMCs will have (i) weak PSM \nfunctions  that  constrain  the  delivery  of  development  programs;  (ii)  expressed  demand  for \n ", "  5 \ndevelopment partners to support PSM strengthening; (iii) effective change agents such as a \ncentral ministry championing MfDR, and a sector institution interested in or implementing MfDR \napproaches; (iv) interest in the CoP modality; (v) a pipeline of projects funded internally or \nthrough development partners that could support identified MfDR approaches and CoP activities \nin the long term; and (vi) the potential capacity to implement the MfDR approaches chosen.  \n \n18.  There are a number of risks and assumptions associated with the outputs and outcome \nof the TA, as listed in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). At the outcome level, \nit is assumed that there will be appropriate financial resources to implement the country-based \nplans for MfDR implementation, since this is one of the criteria for country selection. However, \nthere is also a risk that there may be a lack of capacity within the government to implement the \ninterventions associated with the MfDR plan. This will be mitigated through the other outputs of \nthe CoP-MfDR, especially those dealing with peer-to-peer and expert support. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The total cost of the R-CDTA is estimated at $520,000. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV $310,000 and TASF-other \nsources $210,000). Additional cofinancing may be obtained from another funding source which \nis to be determined. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  ADB,  through  the  Results  Unit  of  the  Strategy  and  Policy  Department,  will  be  the \nexecuting agency of the TA and will be responsible for overall management and monitoring of \nthe activities. The Results Unit will work in close coordination with the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, regional departments, and resident missions. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 14 months, commencing in January 2011 and ending \nin March 2012. It will need one international consultant, on an intermittent basis, as a technical \ncoordinator for the duration of the regional TA (up to 6 person-months of work). The technical \ncoordinator  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  liaising  with  and  supporting  coordinating  committee \nmembers, (ii) responding to technical and functional queries, (iii) directing online and seminar-\nbased capacity development, (iv) updating the virtual resources center, (v) facilitating country-\nbased CoP interventions, (vi) supporting the production of publications, and (vii) linking the \nAsia\u2013Pacific CoP-MfDR with other regional CoPs. Two full-time national consultants will be \nrequired for financial, administrative, and research support (up to 14 person-months each). \nHigh-quality, experienced international consultants will support the country-CoP-driven PSM \ninterventions in the selected DMCs, and will be engaged on an intermittent basis (about 1 \nperson-months of work in total). All consultants will be recruited on an individual basis  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. Confirmation of no-\nobjection of DMC governments will be obtained before the commencement or financing of \nactivities in the territories of the concerned DMCs. \n \nIV.

Technical Coordinator of the Asia\u2013Pacific Community of Practice on Managing for \nDevelopment Results (international, 6 person-months) \n \n1.  The regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) requires an international \nconsultant  to  act  as  TA  coordinator  to  perform  a  full  range  of  technical  coordination  and \nadministration functions to ensure successful delivery of expected TA outputs.
