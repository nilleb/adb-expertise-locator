INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  member  states  are  taking \nconcerted efforts to implement their regional cooperation and integration (RCI) commitments \nunder the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint. While substantial progress has been \nachieved, there are still many measures that need to be implemented by December 2015, some \nof which will require an ongoing commitment to regional integration beyond 2015. To this end, \nthe  bottom\u2013up  approach  of  the  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines  East \nASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA)1 and the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle \n(IMT-GT)2 subregional programs are beginning to complement the top\u2013down approach being \ntaken by ASEAN. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing technical support to \nthese two subregional programs since 1996. The ministers and senior officials from the member \ncountries of these subregions have requested technical assistance (TA) to continue advancing \nregional integration. \n \n2.  BIMP-EAGA was established in 1994 to accelerate the socioeconomic development of \nless-developed, marginalized, and geographically remote areas in these four countries as part \nof a broader goal to narrow development gaps. The objective of BIMP-EAGA is reflected in its \ngeographic focus on provinces and states that are relatively underdeveloped, rather than on \nentire national territories. In addition to the entire sultanate of Brunei Darussalam, participating \nentities include nine provinces in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, the island chain of Maluku, and Papua \n(Indonesia); the federal states of Sabah and Sarawak, and the federal territory of Labuan \n(Malaysia); and Mindanao (26 provinces) and the province of Palawan (the Philippines). The \nBIMP-EAGA program covers (i) cross-border trade and investment; (ii) customs, immigration, \nquarantine, and security; (iii) infrastructure development, which includes transport, energy, and \ninformation and communication technology; (iv) natural resource development, which consists \nof  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  environment;  (v)  development  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises;  and  (vi)  tourism.  The  IMT-GT  was  established  in  1993  with  the  objective  of \naccelerating the economic transformation of the member states and provinces in the three \nmember countries by exploiting their underlying complementarities and comparative advantages. \nThe  geographic  scope  of  the  IMT-GT  includes  32  provinces  and  states\u201414  provinces  in \nsouthern Thailand, 8 states in Peninsular Malaysia, and 10 provinces on the island of Sumatra \nin Indonesia. The IMT-GT program of cooperation presently covers (i) agriculture, (ii) halal \nproducts and services, (iii) human resource development, (iv) tourism, (v) trade and investment, \nand (vi) transport and infrastructure. \n \n3.  Previous regional TA in support of IMT-GT and BIMP-EAGA accentuated ADB\u2019s role as \ndevelopment partner and regional adviser to the two subregional programs,  enhanced the \nprograms\u2019  strategic  directions  and  initiated  efforts  to  develop  investment  projects.3 Recent \nsummit declarations by IMT-GT and BIMP-EAGA expressed appreciation for ADB support and \nrequested additional assistance for these subregional programs. The proposed TA will build on \nsuccesses and lessons and further enhance the effectiveness of the BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT \nprograms to advance RCI in Southeast Asia. In particular, the TA will support the identification, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  of  priority  RCI  projects  and  initiatives  to  allow  these  two \nprograms to contribute more effectively towards a more connected and integrated Southeast \nAsian region. The TA will also support the recommendations of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of \nStrategy  2020,4 which  called  for  ADB  to  enhance  its  role  in  catalyzing  RCI  efforts  by  (i) \n                                                \n1  Comprising Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. \n2  Comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. \n3  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nenhancing regional connectivity, (ii) moving to second-generation regional integration initiatives, \n(iii) taking an active role in project development and regional public goods, and (iv) supporting \ntrade facilitation. The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 RCI pillar,5 the Midterm Review \nof Strategy 2020, and ADB\u2019s 2006 RCI strategy.6 The RCI sections in the relevant country \nprograms  and  strategies  also  include  support  to  IMT-GT  and  BIMP-EAGA  as  strategic \ndevelopment priorities. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.7 \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The two subregional programs are making increasing efforts to link their activities with \nwider  regional  initiatives,  while  maintaining  their  respective  independence  and  regional \ncooperation niches. Unfortunately, some linkages remain weak, and the urgency for increased \nsynergy has intensified, given the requirements for the AEC. The need to widen and deepen \nregional and subregional synergies by identifying sector-wide approaches across programs was \na key finding of a recent ADB study, which calls for increased efforts to enhance the potential of \nBIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT to be core building blocks for the AEC.8 Greater consistency by the \ntwo subregional programs with the policies and rules agreed to by ASEAN member states would \ncontribute to a more reliable and sustainable integration process, and strengthen the support of \ncentral  governments  for  their  respective  initiatives  and  projects.  Identifying  points  of \nconvergence and complementarity across subregional programs to support RCI will further \nenhance the effectiveness of these programs. \n \n5.  In  2012,  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT  programs  adopted  implementation  blueprints  for \n2012\u20132016 that included rolling project pipelines. These blueprints are currently midway through \ntheir implementation periods, and about 70% of priority projects identified in 2012 have begun \nimplementation; about 5%\u20138% have been completed.9 However, capacity for monitoring project \noutputs and development outcomes remains limited.10 Therefore, continuation of ADB support \nfor  project  implementation  is  crucial.  Further  development  of  institutional  capacity  and \nsustainable mechanisms to manage development results are also essential. IMT-GT and BIMP-\nEAGA leaders sought ADB\u2019s continued assistance in these areas at their respective summits in \nMyanmar in May 2014. \n \n6.  Furthermore,  given  the  renewed  commitment  to  enhancing  connectivity  under  both \nprograms, new projects need to be identified and formulated. The subregions recognize the \nincreasing complexity involved in identifying, structuring, financing, and implementing second-\ngeneration RCI projects. Future projects will also need to address development issues facing \nthe middle-income countries that comprise these subregions, including (i) rapidly growing and \nincreasingly congested and polluted urban areas; (ii) lack of access to reliable power supplies to \nserve new industries and the needs of a growing middle class; (iii) the need to attract private \ninvestment in innovative sectors to enable the subregions to move up in international value \nchains; (iv) the need to leverage subregional cooperation to test new ideas and approaches that \ncan prepare communities to address climate change impacts; (v) how to facilitate the movement \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n7  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 November 2014. \n8  ADB. 2013. Regional and Subregional Program Links. Manila. \n9  The draft midterm review of the IMT-GT implementation blueprint shows that only 8% of the priority projects have \nbeen completed and 74% are ongoing. In BIMP-EAGA, 5% of projects are estimated to be completed, with 60% \nongoing. \n10 While in-country institutional arrangements are  generally well-defined, country-to-country coordination across \nsubregional programs are not. While the IMT-GT Secretariat is now established, its capacity is still weak, and the \nBIMP-EAGA Facilitation Center has yet to resolve legalization issues. \n ", "  3 \nof skilled labor; and (vi) high logistics costs, including as a result of obstacles to trade and \ntransport facilitation (TTF). \n \n7.  In order to sustain subregional cooperation efforts to address these development issues, \nboth  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT  have  recognized  the  importance  of  establishing  effective \nprogram-level institutional mechanisms. One example is the newly legalized and self-funded \nCentre for IMT-GT Subregional Cooperation (CIMT) which serves as the secretariat for IMT-GT. \nBIMP-EAGA is also in the process of establishing a permanent facilitation center.11 However, \nthe CIMT, as well as the BIMP-EAGA facilitation center (BEFC), will need substantial capacity \nbuilding  to  develop  RCI  project  pipelines,  implement  projects,  and  monitor  and  evaluate \ndevelopment results, both at the subregional and project levels. While efforts have been initiated \nto  better  collect,  store,  and  analyze  subregional  data,  more  comprehensive  systems  and \nprocedures are needed to develop comprehensive databases for BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT that \nsupport evidence-based decision making by subregional policy makers. Furthermore, there is a \nneed  to  promote greater  private  sector  participation  in  both  subregional  programs through \nincreased investment, trade, and transfer of knowledge and technical expertise. The TA design \nincorporates the following lessons from previous TA projects: (i) all studies and initiatives to be \nsupported must have full ownership by subregional and national secretariats; (ii) the private \nsector should be consulted and involved in most initiatives; and (iii) to ensure consistency, \nstudies and assessment should take into consideration ASEAN plans and agreements. \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be the BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT subregions become more integrated \nwith themselves, and with the ASEAN region. The outcome will be BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT \nprojects and initiatives under the implementation blueprints are implemented. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The three TA outputs and associated key activities are described below: \n(i)  Output 1: Improved sector coordination between the subregional programs \nand the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The TA will support greater \nsynchronization  and  linkages  of  subregional  sector  strategies  with  broader \nASEAN frameworks and initiatives. The TA will help translate ASEAN strategic \nobjectives, initiatives, and agreements\u2014such as those concerning TTF and the \nmutual recognition of professionals\u2014into specific subregional projects. As such, \nBIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT demonstration projects could also serve as incubators \nor pilots for broader regional RCI initiatives.12 Activities under this output include \n(a) organizing two joint, sector-level dialogues and workshops between ASEAN \nand the two subregions, in coordination with sector working groups; and (b) \nidentifying approaches for specific sector linkages, such as TTF, and facilitating \nthe  movement  of  skilled  workers  through  mutual  recognition  agreements. \nFurthermore, the traditional focus on enhancing physical connectivity projects will \ncontinue to be aligned with the master plan on ASEAN connectivity. \n(ii)  Output  2:  Regional  thematic  studies  on  cooperation  and  integration \ndeveloped  and  implemented. This output will support the identification and \nimplementation of RCI thematic studies that could be the basis for new pilot \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n                                                \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n11 The lack of a BIMP-EAGA facilitation center as a permanent international institution, following the model of the \nCIMT, has made the BIMP-EAGA program less effective than the IMT-GT. \n12 The signing of the memorandum of understanding for the movement of buses in BIMP-EAGA is an example of a \ndemonstration project that has been replicated by ASEAN. \n ", "4   \nprojects and initiatives, covering the five countries included in the TA. Activities \nunder  this  output  include  (a)  supporting  sector  working  groups  in  the \nimplementation  of  blueprint  projects  and  thematic  studies;  (b)  preparing  the \nsecond phase of ongoing thematic signature initiatives, such as special border \neconomic  zones,  the  Green  Cities  Initiative,  the  Borneo\u2013Mindanao  power \ninterconnection, and climate vulnerability assessments; and (c) preparing studies \nin  two  new  areas,  namely  TTF  in  BIMP-EAGA  and  investment  profiling  of \neconomic corridors in IMT-GT.13 These new initiatives are also expected to help \nattract private sector investment to the subregion, in particular to Mindanao in the \nPhilippines, where the peace process with Bangsamoro is gaining momentum \nand is creating new opportunities for the entire BIMP-EAGA. \n(iii)  Output 3: Managing for development results enhanced. The TA will support \nthe  two  subregional  programs  in  establishing  and  implementing  a  practical \nsystem  of  managing  for  development  results,  at  the  institutional,  sector  and \nproject levels, and will include the following activities: (a) assist the CIMT and \nBEFC to develop business plans, regulations, guidelines, and key performance \nindicators  to  improve  their  operational  capacity  as  regional  secretariats;  (b) \ndesign and implement selected capacity enhancement training programs on RCI-\nrelated themes for government officials working in the national secretariats, the \nCIMT  and  BEFC  and  in  local  governments\u2014the  RCI  themes  could  include \nspecial  border  economic  zones,  green  cities,  climate  change,  TTF,  power \ntransmission, or regional project design, and will be linked to ADB\u2019s operational \nprograms  and  technical  expertise;  (c)  assist  subregional  secretariats  to \ninstitutionalize the compilation and dissemination of economic, trade, investment, \nand tourism data (including metadata) at the subregional level; and (d) assist \nsubregional secretariats to develop a project database incorporating key project \nmonitoring indicators, with baselines and targets. \n \n10.  Based on the outputs and activities above, major assumptions of the TA are that the \nparticipating governments remain politically committed to RCI, that the subregional secretariats \nare  both  capable  and  cooperative,  and  that  ASEAN  lends  sufficient  advisory  and  political \nsupport  to  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT.  Major  risks  include:  (i)  inadequate  private  sector \nparticipation, (ii) project task forces operate inefficiently due to low capacity, (iii) insufficient data \nare available for a comprehensive monitoring framework, (iv) private sector participation is \ninadequate, (v) clusters and working groups cannot agree on and identify new regional projects, \nand (vi) countries do not appoint qualified staff to the BEFC. To mitigate these risks, the TA will \nwork  closely  with  the  subregional  and  national  secretariats  to  improve  capacity,  facilitate \ncoordination with ASEAN bodies, and develop tools to facilitate private sector involvement. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2013other  sources).  The  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT \ngovernments will (i) provide counterpart support in the form of staff to work with ADB and TA \nconsultants; (ii) make substantive contributions in technical and regional meetings; and (iii) \nprovide logistical arrangements, secretarial assistance, domestic transport, and other in-kind \ncontributions. ADB staff is expected to act as resource persons or facilitators; charging of travel \ncosts to the TA is foreseen, with approximately 5% of the budget allocated for representational \n                                                \n13 Investment  profiling  includes  the  identification  of  private  sector  investment  opportunities  along  strategic \nsubsections of economic corridors, including but not limited to physical infrastructure, industrial parks, logistics \ncenters, and agro-processing zones. \n ", "  5 \ncosts at training sessions, workshops, seminars, and conferences, which are confirmed as \ndirect and identifiable costs of the TA. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB, through the Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division (SERC) in \nADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department, will implement the TA over 18 months from 1 January 2015 \nto 30 June 2016. SERC will coordinate with the Southeast Asia sector divisions and resident \nmissions to implement specific activities. For example, SERC will work with the Urban and \nWater Division to implement the Green Cities Initiative, with the Energy Division in preparing \nstudies to develop power transmission lines, and with the Environment Division in developing \nsubregional  climate  change  vulnerability  studies.  SERC  will  (i)  create,  consolidate,  and \ndisseminate  knowledge  and  information  to  support  IMT-GT  and  BIMP-EAGA;  (ii)  help \nsubregional  bodies  build  their  institutional  capacity  to  more  effectively  manage  regional \ncooperation; and (iii) act as facilitator, catalyst, and coordinator of subregional cooperation. \nADB\u2019s knowledge departments and communities of practice could also collaborate on some TA \nactivities. SERC will appoint two international staff, one national officer, and one operations \nassistant to coordinate the TA. ADB review missions will regularly monitor and report on major \nTA  activities.  TA  implementation  will  be  conducted  in  close  consultation  with  the  relevant \nnational  coordinators  in  each  member  country,  including  the  BEFC,  the  CIMT,  and,  when \nrelevant, with the ASEAN Secretariat. \n \n13.  The TA requires 13.5 person-months of international and 21 person-months of national \nconsulting services. Most international consultants will be engaged to do short-term studies. \nOne national consultant will be hired to work fulltime as regional development analyst for the TA. \nConsultants will be recruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended form time to time), as the services to be delivered are too \ndiverse  and  specialized for  a  single  firm to  cover. Output-based  (lump  sum)  contracts for \nconsulting services will be used when feasible and appropriate. The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  The purchase of equipment (computer hardware and software) will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and in \ncoordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Information  Systems  and  Technology  and  Office  of \nAdministrative Services, where applicable. Upon TA completion, any procured equipment will be \ndisposed of in compliance with Project Administration Instruction 3.11.14 Disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, amended from time to time). Good practices and lessons will be disseminated through \nknowledge products and other publications, workshops, and through transfer of knowledge to \nBEFC, the CIMT, and, when relevant, the ASEAN Secretariat. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nAdvancing  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  through  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013\nMalaysia\u2013Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area  and  Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand  Growth \n \nTriangle, and hereby reports this action to the Board.\nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2014.
