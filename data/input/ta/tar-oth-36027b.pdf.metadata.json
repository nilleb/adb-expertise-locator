Transition to market economy and private sector-led development is a feature common \nto all developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the East \nand Central Asia (ECA) region.1 Development of an enabling trading environment is an integral \npart of the transition strategies and has been rigorously pursued by the DMCs through trade \npolicy reforms and trade facilitation measures. A regional approach has emerged in the effort as \nreflected in (i) the collective commitment to accede to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and \nreforms of trade policies according to WTO Rules and Agreements, and (ii) concerted efforts to \nreform customs codes and modernize customs services as a key measure for trade facilitation.  \n \n2.  ADB plays a major role in support of a regional and concerted approach for trade policy \nreforms and trade facilitation. A Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation Program \n(RTFCCP)  was  launched  in  2002  as  part  of  the  broad  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Program, supported by major multilateral institutions (MIs).2 To support \nWTO  accession  and  trade  policy  reforms,  a  Trade  Policy  Committee  coordinated  by  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) was recently established as part of the CAREC Program.  \n \n3.  The RTFCCP is a three-pronged strategy: (i) supporting reforms of customs codes and \nmodernization of customs physical infrastructure, (ii) fostering customs intermediaries (such as \ncustoms  brokers)  and  their  participation  in  providing  customs  services,  and  (iii)  promoting \nregional  customs  cooperation  to  address  issues  of  common  interest  and  complementing \ncountry-specific support. The initial phase of the RTFCCP consisted of program loans for the \nKyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  to  support  customs  legal  and  institutional  reforms,  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  customs  modernization  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment for the two DMCs, and a regional TA supporting regional customs cooperation and \ncomplementing project and program loan support. A Regional Customs Modernization and \nInfrastructure Development Project for the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan is expected to be \napproved  by  ADB  in  2004  to  help  reinforce  the  ongoing  customs  legal  reforms,  improve \nefficiency and transparency of customs services, and provide requisite physical infrastructure for \ndeepening regional customs cooperation.  \n \n4.   The regional TA has been supporting a program of activities jointly developed by the \nDMCs in the ECA region and the institutional mechanism for carrying out the work program. To \nprovide strategic guidance and effective supervision, a Customs Cooperation Committee (CCC) \nconsisting of the heads of the customs administrations of participating DMCs was established in \n2002 with ADB serving as the secretariat. In its first meeting in August 2002, the CCC endorsed \na  seven-point  joint  action  plan  calling  for  concerted  effort  to  harmonize  customs  legal \nframeworks and procedures, promote modern customs practices based on risk management \nand joint customs control, explore alternative transit arrangements, and promote customs data \nsharing  and  greater  application  of  information  and  communications  technology  (ICT)  for \nautomation of customs services. Five expert groups and two working groups were established \nto carry out the joint action plan and report progress to the CCC.  \n \n5.  ADB has taken a pragmatic approach in support of regional customs cooperation. The \nregional TA has financed a large number of activities consisting of (i) regional and bilateral \ninitiatives and (ii) country-specific proposals for training, needs assessment, and diagnostic \nstudies  in  preparation  for  customs  legal  reforms  and  infrastructure  development.  It  has \n                                                 \n1 The developing member countries (DMCs) in the East and Central Asia (ECA) region consists of Azerbaijan, \nKazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan. \n2 Major multilateral institutions supporting the CAREC Program are Asian Development Bank, European Bank for \nReconstruction  and  Development,  International  Monetary  Fund,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, and World Bank.   \n ", "2  \nsupported the expert group and working group meetings each year in an effort to identify shared \npriorities and firm up the joint work plan.  \n \n6.  The  RTFCCP  has  achieved  visible  progress  to  date  and  has  increasingly  been \nrecognized as a flagship program of the CAREC Program. It has benefited from support from \nmajor bilateral and multilateral institutions, particularly World Customs Organization (WCO), \nEuropean Union through its Program of Transport Corridor in Europe-Caucasus-Central Asia, \nSwiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation,  IMF,  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  World  Bank.  The \nestablishment of the coordination group of the major MIs at the 2nd Ministerial Conference on \n11\u201312 November 2003 in Tashkent has further strengthened aid coordination for the CAREC \nProgram, and the RTFCCP in particular. A brief summary of progress in phase I of the RTFCCP \nis in Appendix 1.3 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n7.  Experience with the RTFCCP and ADB\u2019s other subregional cooperation programs shows \nthat  regional  cooperation  initiatives  are  labor-  and  resource-intensive.  Adequate  technical \nassistance must  be  ensured  to  keep  the  momentum  of  regional  cooperation  and  produce \ntangible results in the medium and longer term. The RTFCCP is at its nascent stage. Technical \nsupport from ADB is crucial for its success and sustainability.  \n \n8.  Another lesson learned is that the approach and priority of regional cooperation must be \nbased on country and regional circumstances. The DMCs joining the RTFCCP are at different \nstages  of  customs  legal  reforms  and  infrastructure  development.  Their  capacity  and \ncommitment  to  regional  customs  cooperation  vary  considerably.  Given  such  differences  in \ncooperation capacity and customs infrastructure conditions, the RTFCCP should proceed with a \nphased and pragmatic approach that focuses on promoting bilateral initiatives and their pilot-\ntesting as a key priority area. This approach is different from other subregional cooperation \ninitiatives where the participating DMCs have more comparable capacity and the focus has \nbeen on entering regional agreements. The emphasis on capacity building and knowledge \nsharing marks another difference from other subregional cooperation initiatives. Support for \nbilateral initiatives and training and knowledge-sharing will remain two priority areas in phase II \nof the RTFCCP. \n   \n9.  Support for country-specific initiatives will be another priority area of phase II support. \nDMCs\u2019 commitment to customs legal reforms and modernization is key to the success and \nsustainability of customs cooperation. Simplification and harmonization of customs procedures \nand documentation ultimately depend on convergence of the customs legal framework among \nthe participating member countries. Phase II of the RTFCCP will continue to provide support for \nneeds assessments and diagnostic studies, and preparation of modernization strategies and \ninvestment  plans.  Support  for  accession  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  to  the \nCustoms  Convention  on  the  International  Transport  of  Goods  also  known  as  the  TIR \nConvention4 will be another country-specific activity with strong regional ramification. The TIR \nCustoms Transit System based on the TIR Convention is the only international transit system \nbased on common procedures and documentation. The PRC is the only participating DMC in \nCAREC that has not acceded to the TIR Convention. PRC\u2019s TIR accession could (i) become a \ncatalytic tool for harmonization and simplification of customs procedures between the PRC and \nother participating member countries, and (ii) potentially transform Central Asia into a modern \n                                                 \n3  Detailed progress is in ADB. 2004.

", "  3\n\u201csilk road\u201d or \u201cland bridge\u201d connecting East Asia with Europe through the TIR Customs Transit \nSystem. \n \n10.  In carrying out phase II of the RTFCCP, priority will be given to proposals and initiatives \nthat  broaden  the  scope  of  trade  facilitation.  The  experience  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and \nKazakhstan with pilot-testing of their joint border control initiative shows that the benefit of trade \nfacilitation cannot be fully realized unless all the border agencies (e.g., border guards) and \nprivate sector stakeholders are consulted and broadly support the trade facilitation initiative. A \ncoordination mechanism must be established to streamline border procedures beyond customs \nprocedures. Therefore, a joint proposal by the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan for consultation \nwith other border agencies and private sector stakeholders could potentially help broaden the \nRTFCCP\u2019s trade facilitation agenda.  \n \n11.  Another issue is the effort to include trade facilitation in the ongoing Doha Round of \nWTO negotiations. Some WTO member countries and the private sector are actively exploring \nthe possibility of bringing trade facilitation into the WTO negotiations and making simplification \nof cross-border procedures a mandatory requirement for all WTO members.  While there is \nbroad  recognition  of  the  economic  and  social  benefits  of  trade  facilitation,  some  WTO\u2019s \ndeveloping members are not enthusiastic to reach an agreement on trade facilitation for fear of \nlack  of  capacity  to  undertake  additional  economic  and  policy  adjustments,  and  increased \nexposure to trade disputes. Phase II of the RTFCCP will help examine the implication of WTO \nnegotiations on trade facilitation for the DMCs, in partnership with WTO and private sector \nstakeholders.  \n \n12.  To effectively use ADB\u2019s TA resources and broaden the learning experiences, DMCs \njoining other subregional cooperation initiatives will be invited to attend the RTFCCP on a case-\nby-case basis, particularly Afghanistan which adopted the RTFCCP\u2019s joint action plan as the \ncooperation framework with DMCs in Central Asia. ADB will also proactively cooperate with the \nmajor MIs supporting the CAREC program and other partners relevant to trade facilitation.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The  broad  goal  of  the  RTFCCP  is  to  facilitate  trade  and  develop  an  enabling \ndevelopment environment in the ECA region through development of simplified and harmonized \ncustoms legal frameworks and trade procedures. The purpose of the proposed regional TA5 is \nto support phase II of the RTFCCP and complement other modalities of support (such as \nprogram and project loans) that achieve (i) concerted customs legal reforms and harmonized \ncustoms procedures, and (ii) strengthened regional customs cooperation.  \n \n14.  The expected outputs of the TA include (i) adoption of revised customs codes by DMCs \nin  the  ECA  region;  (ii)  customs  modernization  for  data  sharing  with  the  establishment  of \ncustoms automation systems compatible with each other; (iii) adoption of risk management-\nbased  customs  control  procedures  as  part  of  broad  customs  modernization  efforts;  (iv) \nimplementation of the bilateral transit agreements among Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and \nTajikistan; (v) establishment of an information platform, pilot-tested initially among selected \nDMCs; (vi) PRC\u2019s accession to the TIR Convention; and (vii) support for accession to WTO and \nnegotiations on trade facilitation. The TA framework is in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n5 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 April 2004.  \n ", "4  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  Building on progress to date, ADB, as the CAREC secretariat, will continue to take a \nselective and pragmatic approach in support of regional customs cooperation. The TA will \ndeliver results by supporting a combination of (i) regional and bilateral activities, and (ii) country-\nspecific proposals with strong regional orientation. The annual CCC meeting and the working or \nexpert group meetings will be maintained to ensure leadership and development of the joint \nworks  program  reflecting  shared  priorities.  Major  activities  agreed  upon  by  the  country \ndelegates  during  the  Senior  Officials\u2019  Meeting  on  13\u201314  September  2004  in  Almaty  are \nsummarized in paras. 16-19.  \n \n16.  Country-Specific Activities with Strong Regional Orientation. To support concerted \ncustoms reforms and infrastructure development, the TA will support diagnostic studies and \nneeds  assessments  including  (i)  support  for  revising  the  customs  codes  as  requested  by \nAzerbaijan and Uzbekistan;6 (ii) needs assessment for customs automation and development of \nborder  post  infrastructure  requested  by  Uzbekistan;  (iii)  feasibility  study,  consultation,  and \ndevelopment  of  an  implementation  plan  for  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  TIR  Convention  in \npartnership with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and International Road \nTransport  Union,  which  administer  the  international  TIR  Customs  Transit  System;  and  (iv) \ndiagnostic studies and associated training to help introduce risk management-based modern \ncustoms control practices as requested by Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.   \n \n17.  Regional  Initiatives.  Regional  initiatives  will  center  on  (i)  training  and  knowledge \nsharing, and (ii) support for bilateral initiatives. Regional training will focus on (i) accession to \nand implementation of the TIR Convention, and (ii) development of a regional framework for a \nrisk management system in light of country experiences with the risk management practices. \nThese two regional events will be cofinanced with the Government of the PRC as its support for \nthe CAREC Program announced in the recent Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting.    \n \n18.  Regional forums for knowledge sharing will focus on country experiences in developing \nintegrated master plans for customs automation. Such master plans include not only functional \nand technical design of the automated system and implementation, but also measures such as \nreengineering  of  customs  business  practices,  change  management,  training  of  staff,  and \nconsultation with private sector stakeholders. Lack of emphasis on the latter is the major source \nof  failure  or  increased  cost  in  customs  modernization.  The  TA  will  help  broaden  learning \nexperiences in the development of master plans and implementation by sponsoring the CCC \nforums in partnership with the governments of Singapore and the Republic of Korea. Both \ncountries successfully introduced their integrated customs information systems and have gained \nample experience in managing the process of customs modernization in partnership with the \nprivate sector.   \n \n19.    A list of the major regional and bilateral initiatives that are proposed by DMCs and will \nbe supported by the TA follows:  \n \n(i)  bilateral consultation forum on joint customs control involving all border agencies \nand private sector stakeholders of the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan;  \n(ii)  development of an information platform for data sharing initially between the \nKyrgyz and PRC customs, and between the Kazakh and PRC customs;  \n(iii)  regional training on risk management cofinanced with PRC Customs; \n(iv)  regional training seminar on TIR in 2005, cofinanced with PRC Customs; \n                                                 \n6  Kazakhstan introduced a revised Customs Code in May 2003. Supported by ADB\u2019s program loans and the TA, the \nKyrgyz Republic introduced the revised Customs Code in July 2004. Tajikistan is expected to introduce the revised \nCode by the end of 2004.  ", "  5\n(v)  forums on customs automation in partnership with the governments of Singapore \n(2005) and the Republic of Korea (2006);   \n(vi)  forum on Doha round of negotiations on trade facilitation (2006);  \n(vii)  annual CCC meetings and working group meetings; and   \n(viii)  regular  consultations  initially  among  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Kazakhstan,  and \nTajikistan customs for development of unified automated customs information \nsystems. \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,120,000, of which $900,000 is proposed to be \nprovided by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA funding program. The governments \nparticipating in the regional TA will contribute around $220,000 equivalent in total by providing \ncounterpart staff, office space, and support for training, seminars, and conferences. Details of \nthe cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Governance, Finance and Trade \nDivision of the East and Central Asia Department will administer and implement the TA with \nsupport from the concerned customs administrations and other stakeholders. The CCC will \nserve as the policy coordinating body providing oversight to TA implementation. Technical work \nunder the TA will be coordinated by the working groups and expert groups. \n \n22.  No activity in the territory of a country will be financed by ADB under the TA unless such \nmember country has concurred to such financing. \n \n23.  The  TA  will  require  consultants  and  resource  persons  for  20  person-months  (10 \ninternational and 10 domestic) of intermittent services. The consultants and resource persons \nwill be customs legal specialists, risk management/post entry audit experts, transit and TIR \nspecialists,  and  customs  modernization/automation  specialists.  In  view  of  the  TA\u2019s  varied \nactivities, the specialists will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting \ndomestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for consultants and resource persons are \nin Appendix 4. Equipment procured under the TA will be in undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The TA, planned for 3 years, is expected to start in January \n2005 and be completed in December 2007. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n24.  The President acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation Program (Phase II), and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nHIGHLIGHTS OF PROGRESS IN THE REGIONAL TRADE FACILITATION  \nAND CUSTOMS COOPERATION PROGRAM (RTFCCP) PHASE I1 \n \n1.  Training  and  Knowledge  Sharing.  Support  for  training  and  regional  forums  for \nknowledge sharing were the main focus of region-wide activities. The developing member \ncountries (DMCs) attach great importance to training and knowledge sharing because these are \nrelevant to individual countries\u2019 ongoing customs reforms and modernization. Knowledge on \ncustoms-related  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  agreements  (e.g.,  rules  of  origin  and \nvaluation),  and  the  International  Convention  on  the  Simplification  and  Harmonization  of \nCustoms Procedures, commonly known as the \u201cRevised Kyoto Convention,\u201d facilitated customs \nlegal reforms. The Revised Kyoto Convention has been serving as a blueprint for customs \nreforms and modernization worldwide. Sharing of country experiences in the use of information \nand communications technology for transit development and customs automation helped the \ndesign of customs modernization strategies and investment plans in light of lessons learned \nelsewhere. Training was conducted on major international customs conventions and customs-\nrelated  WTO  agreements.  Three  regional  forums  were  held  to  compare  customs  legal \nframeworks and share country experiences in customs automation.  \n \n2.  Bilateral Initiatives. Emphasis on bilateral initiatives reflects the nature of regional \ncooperation and the pragmatic approach adopted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nsupport  of  regional  cooperation.  Regional  customs  cooperation  requires  strong  country \nownership and takes time to realize its full potential. Bilateral initiatives by nature rest on strong \ncountry  commitment  of  at  least  two  countries  and  have  strong  demonstration  effects  for \nbecoming  regional  initiatives.  In  view  of  the  varied  stages  of  customs  modernization  and \ndisparity in countries\u2019 capacity for cooperation, this pragmatic approach proved effective in \nadvancing the joint action plan and achieving tangible results in transit development, sharing of \ncustoms data, and adoption of joint customs control. Major bilateral initiatives supported by the \ntechnical assistance (TA) are the following: \n \n(i)  pilot-testing  of  joint  customs  control  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and \nKazakhstan customs, effective 1 July 2004; \n(ii)  consultation and preparation of a data-sharing agreement between the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  Customs,  signed  in \nSeptember 2004; \n(iii)  development  of  a  transit  agreement  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and \nKazakhstan, signed on 26 March 2004; \n(iv)  consultation between the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan customs in entering into \na transit agreement by the end of 2004; \n(v)  development of an agreement for mutual administrative assistance between the \nPRC and Uzbekistan customs, to be signed during the Third CCC meeting in \nDecember 2004; and  \n(vi)  consultation between the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan customs in preparing a \nregional  project  for  customs  modernization  and  infrastructure  development \nsupported by ADB.  \n \n3.  Country-Specific Initiatives with Strong Regional Orientation. Individual countries\u2019 \neffort to reform the customs code and modernize customs services in line with the Revised \nKyoto Convention is the key to achieve harmonized customs procedures among the DMCs in \n                                                 \n1  For more details, see http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2004/CCC/Customs_Reforms_Modernization/ \n   RTFCCP   framework.pdf ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nthe East and Central Asia (ECA) Region. The TA supported individual countries\u2019 reforms of the \ncustoms codes, particularly in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan where such reforms are the \nkey item in the policy program supported by two program loans. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the TA \nfunded a detailed diagnostic study to compare the existing Customs Code with the Revised \nKyoto Convention, and supported the revision of customs procedures based on the newly \nadopted Customs Code. For Tajikistan, the TA funded a review of the draft Customs Code. The \nTA financed detailed capacity assessment for the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan to prepare \nfor adopting risk management-based customs control practices. A comprehensive customs \nmodernization strategy and investment plan is being developed for Mongolia under the TA. \nThese assessments and diagnostic studies made training relevant to individual countries\u2019 needs \nand enriched regional forums for sharing customs modernization strategies and experiences.   \n \n4.  Support for the Institutional Framework and Working Arrangement. The TA funded \na  joint  working  group  meeting  and  four  expert  group  meetings  to  develop  detailed  work \nprograms and implementation arrangements for joint initiatives. The CCC meeting has been \nheld annually to ensure leadership and strategic guidance in regional customs cooperation. Six \nworking papers were prepared on all the priority areas identified in the joint action plan to \nfacilitate discussions in those events.2  \n \n5.  Lessons Learned. Regional customs cooperation activities have proved to be labor and \nresource-intensive. Each regional activity required extensive pre-event consultation to ensure \nthat the program and agenda reflected the shared interests of the Regional Trade Facilitation \nand Customs Cooperation Program (RTFCCP) member countries. Indeed, cooperation has \nbeen a process of identifying shared priorities and narrowing the focus of cooperation activities. \nThis suggests that regional customs cooperation target modest goals, focusing on activities with \nstrong country ownership and demonstration effects.  \n \n6.  As catalyst and secretariat of CAREC, ADB should take a phased approach, focusing its \nsupport initially on bilateral initiatives that have the strong commitment of at least two RTFCCP \nmember countries. ADB should also provide support in pilot-testing bilateral initiatives that if \nproven successful, can be introduced in other RTFCCP member countries. The recent efforts to \ngear support toward bilateral initiatives (such as data sharing and transit agreements) is a step \ntoward this direction.  \n \n7.  Commitment to customs reforms and modernization by RTFCCP member countries is \nkey to the success and sustainability of customs cooperation. All the proposed joint activities \n(such as joint border processing, data sharing and transit development initiatives) will ultimately \ndepend on individual countries\u2019 efforts in customs legal reform and modernization. The regional \ncustoms cooperation activities and country-specific modernization efforts must complement and \nreinforce each other.  \n \n8.  Effective aid coordination is critical in extending concerted support and in maximizing the \nimpact of development assistance. Several development partners in the region give priority \nassistance  to  trade  facilitation  and  regional  customs  cooperation.
