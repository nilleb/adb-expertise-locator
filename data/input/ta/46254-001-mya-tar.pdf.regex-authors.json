INTRODUCTION \n1.   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  in  the  preliminary  stages  of  reengaging  in \neconomic policy advice and capacity development with the Government of the Republic of the \nUnion of Myanmar. ADB adopted a three-phased process of reengagement with Myanmar in \nearly 2012: phase I\u2014preparation of initial economic and sector assessments as an extension of \nwork  done  under  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Program;  phase  II\u2014conduct  of \ncomprehensive sector assessments, capacity and institutional support, and project preparation; \nand  phase  III\u2014resumption  of  lending  operations,  subject  to  satisfactory  progress  in  the \ncountry\u2019s engagement with the international community and clearing of its arrears. ADB has \ncompleted phase I and is moving toward phase II by preparing for technical assistance (TA) \noperations focused on capacity building and institutional strengthening. This CDTA will support \nthe implementation of the Interim Country Partnership Strategy for Myanmar, 2012-2014. \n \n2.  The government has requested capacity development TA to support its economic reform \nagenda. The TA is designed to strengthen the capacity of the government to develop and \nimplement policies through a combination of policy advice, learning programs, workshops and \nseminars, and exposure to experiences from neighbor countries that faced similar challenges. \nGiven that the capacity constraints are overwhelming and resources limited, the proposed TA \nwill be selective in its interventions. It will improve the capacity of civil servants in government \nministries and related public companies, although support to divisions and states could also be \nconsidered. The sectors to be included in the TA have been selected according to government \npriorities and the potential for ADB support based on preliminary needs assessments, strategies, \nand road maps. The government concurs with the impact, outcome, outputs, and key activities \nas presented in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.   The  new  government  is  implementing  a  broad  set  of  reforms  as  it embarks  on  a \nremarkable transition to build an economy that will benefit all citizens. Some major ongoing \ninitiatives concern exchange rate unification, reform of land and investment laws, amendment to \nthe Central Bank Act, finance sector reforms, and reform of the trade union law. These reforms \noffer  a  unique  opportunity  for  the  country  to  lay  the  foundations  for  a  brighter  and  more \nprosperous future for its people. The political and economic developments since early 2011 \nopen unprecedented opportunities for Myanmar to catch up with its neighbors and increase its \nper capita gross domestic product, one of the lowest in Southeast Asia at about $860; reduce \nthe poverty rate from the current 26% to 16% of the country\u2019s 60 million people; and improve \nhuman development indicators (Myanmar is near the bottom of the list at 149  out of 187 \ncountries). The changes and speed of reform have been impressive, but the challenges are \ncomplex and numerous. \n \n4.  The country is facing several binding development constraints, including (i) a weak \neconomic  policy  framework  and  environment  that  needs  urgent  reforms  to  maintain \nmacroeconomic  stability,  strengthen  public  finance,  promote  private-sector-led  trade  and \ninvestment, and provide timely and reliable statistics to inform policy decisions; (ii) limited \ncapacity of government civil servants for formulating and managing the policy and institutional \nreform process, coordinating among themselves, and managing external assistance; (iii) weak \npublic  institutions  that have  difficulties to  effectively  support the  economic reform  process, \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27July 2012. \n ", "2   \nefficiently provide essential public services, and develop and enforce strategies, plans, laws, \nrules, regulations and standards; and (iv) lack of efficient physical infrastructure to support trade \nand investment in agriculture, manufacturing, and industry, as well as to provide a sufficient \nlevel of services to both the urban and rural populations.  \n   \n5.  The country needs to embark on a comprehensive and well-sequenced program of \nreforms if it is to realize its potential. The regulatory, legal, and policy environment needs \nupgrading to facilitate the participation of the private sector, promote investment, and diversify \nthe economy. The government needs to develop strategies, investment plans and incentives, \nand generate  adequate fiscal  resources  to  expand  access to  electricity,  water  supply  and \nsanitation, and transport, as well as to improve health, education, and social protection systems. \nAgriculture, which employs about 70% of the population, has great potential for improvement, \nbut is in great need of land reform, expansion of credit to farmers, more public investment in \nrural infrastructure, and better seeds, fertilizers, extension services, and post-harvest facilities. \n \n6.  The capacity of existing socioeconomic policymaking institutions in Myanmar is limited \nand needs to be bolstered if appropriate economic policy reforms are to be designed and \nimplemented successfully. Strengthening these institutions and giving them more independence \nin decision making in their areas of responsibility would increase accountability and contribute to \nbetter governance and greater transparency and efficiency. The Myanmar civil service has a \ncritical role to play in this reform process. However, the majority of the civil servants have limited \nexposure to modern public sector management and good governance practices. They have had \nvery  few  opportunities  to  develop  new  techniques  and  skills,  to  learn  lessons  from  other \ncountries, or to access high-quality policy advice.  \n \n7.  To avoid duplication and overstretching of the government\u2019s absorptive capacity, the TA \nwill be implemented in consultation with other development agencies that are providing related \nassistance to the government. The TA takes into account lessons learned from other capacity-\nbuilding  TA  projects,  especially  the  need  for  strong  government  ownership  for  TA  to  be \nsuccessful and sustainable. The TA also builds on and complements other capacity-building TA \nprojects. In particular, it will harness the experience developed under the ADB-financed GMS \nPhnom  Penh  Plan for Development  Management,2 which  since  2005  has  provided  limited \nsupport to improve the capacity of civil servants through learning programs outside Myanmar. \n \n8.  Policy advisors will support selected government agencies in preparing the new policy \nagenda,  in  line  with  the  government  strategy  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  sustainable \neconomic growth. Advisors placed in key ministries will work closely with government officials to \nassist them in the preparation of policy papers, plans, strategies, laws, or regulations. They will \nalso suggest improvements to management systems, policies, and procedures in the ministries \nthrough the preparation of institutional development plans. These will be complemented by the \npreparation of capacity-building plans based on training needs assessments, in-country training \nprograms based on demand, and out-of-country programs to learn lessons and best practices \nfrom neighbor countries. The TA will also support workshops, seminars, and conferences to \nshare knowledge and discuss economic development and policy issues. \n \n                                                \n2 The Phnom Penh Plan builds capacity of civil servants for leadership, public policy, and development management; \nand promotes regional cooperation in the countries of the GMS. ", "3 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be the implementation of effective and efficient policies and strategies in \nkey sectors. The outcome will be for participating ministries to adopt effective and efficient \npolicies, strategies, plans, laws, or regulations in their sectors.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Three outputs are envisaged for the TA with key activities as follows:  \n \n11.   Output 1: Institutional capacity of ministries to design policies and strategies is \nstrengthened. Key activities will encompass (i) strategic and policy advice by long-term and \nshort-term national and international experts placed as advisors in key ministries, and (ii) design \nof initial institutional development plans (strategic plans and organization development) in select \nministries or groups of ministries. The advisors will work closely with the civil servants and \nministers on developing or updating policies, plans, strategies, or legislation, as demanded by \nthe ministries. Transfer of knowledge and skills, and on-the-job training activities, from the \nadvisors to the civil servants will be a key component of this output. \n \n12.  Output 2: Myanmar government officials acquire knowledge and develop skills. \nActivities will include (i) a training needs assessment within and across selected ministries; (ii) a \ncapacity-building  plan  that  will  determine  priority  learning  needs  in  line  with  institutional \ndevelopment;  (iii) training in public policy and development management (managing change, \npublic  management,  project  management,  negotiations,  building  of  teams,  leadership); \n(iv) technical and policy training programs for specific sectors in which ADB could support \nMyanmar (planning, finance and trade, public financial management, energy, transport, urban \nand water supply, agriculture and natural resources, and education); and (v)  training programs \nto familiarize key civil servants with ADB operations, policies, instruments, and procedures \n(project design and implementation, economic and financial analyses, environmental and social \nsafeguards, procurement). The in-country training programs will focus on middle and senior \nmanagement in central and key line ministries. The programs will be designed and implemented, \nwhen feasible, in partnership with Myanmar education and training institutions such as the \nMyanmar  Development  Resource  Institute,  Union  of  Myanmar  Federation  of  Chambers  of \nCommerce and Industry, Union Civil Service Board, and the Myanmar\u2013Singapore Training \nCenter (under the Initiative for ASEAN Integration), among others. The sector divisions of ADB's \nSoutheast Asia Department will lead capacity-building activities for their sectors. ADB staff in \nother departments (Central Operations Services Office, Controller's Department, Regional and \nSustainable Development Department, and Strategy and Policy Department) may contribute to \nthe training on ADB policies and procedures. \n \n13.  Output 3: Good practices, lessons learned, and experiences from other countries \nare disseminated. Activities include out-of-country, on-the job training attended by a cross-\nsection of civil servants from various ministries to learn lessons from other ASEAN countries \nand promote cooperation between developing countries. ADB resident missions will assist the \nselection  of  government  counterparts,  facilitators,  and  capacity-building  partners  in  their \nrespective countries. \n \n14.  The  preliminary  sector  assessments,  strategies,  and  road  maps,  prepared  in  close \ncoordination  with  government  ministries,  have  determined  the  initial  capacity  needs  of \n ", "4   \ngovernment institutions. A basic training needs assessment will also be prepared at the start of \nthe TA, which will be used in design and delivery of the TA\u2019s capacity development programs for \nMyanmar civil servants in relevant ministries, especially on policy design and implementation, \ndevelopment planning, project management, and service delivery.  \n \n15.  The TA is expected to assist in the following areas: (i) macroeconomics, development \nplanning, and statistics; (ii) energy; (iii) transport; (iv) agriculture and natural resources; and \n(v) urban development and water supply and sanitation. However, the TA is designed in a way \nthat allows flexibility to support other sectors, cross-sector, and thematic areas depending on \nthe emerging needs of and demands from the government.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.765 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  ADB  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2013other  sources).  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart salaries and office space. \nThe detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development (MNPED) will be the \nexecuting agency. A sub-committee under the Aid Management Working Committee will be \nformed by the government, which will include senior officials from the participating ministries. \nThe sub-committee will coordinate TA activities and serve as a forum for exchanging lessons in \ncapacity development across ministries. A TA focal point in each participating ministry will \nprovide administration support for the conduct of all activities. The sub-committee will also \nselect participants for the training programs. ADB will attend the sub-committee meetings as an \nobserver. \n \n18.  International and national consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). TA implementation \nis anticipated to require 42 person-months of international consultancy and 39 person-months of \nnational consultancy. The consultants will be recruited as individuals. Their outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThey will be included in the TA expenditures if they are reasonable in amount and nature. The \nduration of the TA will be from December 2012 to November 2013. Office equipment will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). On completion of the TA, all equipment will be turned over to MNPED. The outputs of the \nTA will be disseminated through seminars, workshops, and publications. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Capacity Development and \nInstitutional Support, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
