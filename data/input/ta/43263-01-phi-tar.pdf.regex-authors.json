INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  Philippines  recognizes  the  pivotal  role  played  by  social \nprotection as a foundation for inclusive growth and poverty reduction. This has been reflected in \nincreasing budget allocation for social protection since 2007\u2014though starting from low initial \nfunding levels\u2014as well as renewed efforts to reform social protection systems. To promote its \nongoing  Medium-Term  Philippines  Development  Plan,  2004\u20132010  and  advance  pro-poor \nsustainable  growth  and  progress  toward  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  the \ngovernment requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support its expansion of an  \nemerging reform agenda for social protection. In response, the Philippines country operations \nbusiness plan, 2010\u20132012 includes support1 focusing on two core programs implemented by \nthe  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and  Development  (DSWD):  (i)  the  Pantawid  Pamilyang \nPilipino Program (4Ps; the Building Bridges for the Filipino Family Program), which was first pilot \ntested in 2007 and provides conditional cash transfers linked to household investments in \neducation and health; and (ii) the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction \n(NHTS-PR). It also includes complementary policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to \npromote broader reforms and accelerate progress toward the MDGs, reducing both income- and \nnon-income forms of poverty.2 In parallel with design dialogue on support for the 4Ps and \nNHTS-PR, an April 2010 fact-finding mission reached agreement with the government on the \nimpact, outcome, scope, and implementation arrangements for the proposed TA.3   \n \n2.  The TA builds on ADB\u2019s role as a sustained partner in promoting economic and social \ndevelopment in the Philippines, including recent support to the government\u2019s social protection \nreform agenda. In addition to engagement in policy dialogue through regional TA and major \npolicy forums, ADB has supported the pilot testing and initial rollout of the 4Ps under two recent \ndevelopment policy support programs\u2014in cooperation with the Government of Japan and in \ncoordination with the World Bank and other development partners\u2014and fiscal support under the \nCountercyclical Support Facility.4 Building on this cooperation, the TA will provide flexible and \ntimely support to the government in pursuing broader reforms to rationalize the social protection \nsector, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of the social protection system in serving the \nneeds of poor and vulnerable groups. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Despite high economic growth, poverty incidence in the Philippines has increased in \nrecent years, rising from 30% in 2003 to 33% in 2006 (the latest year for which official figures \nare available), while larger shares of Filipinos are highly vulnerable to external shocks such as \nthose related to illness, loss of employment, natural disasters, or price increases.5 Intertwined \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2010.

Manila (Loan 2662-PHI, TA 7586-PHI, and TA 7587-PHI). \n2 The TA was included in the program under the initial title of MDG Acceleration and Poverty Reduction, and first \nappeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 August 2010. \n3 The TA\u2019s focus was reconfirmed at a November 2010 meeting chaired by the DSWD on aligning TA and related \nassistance across multiple development partners.   \n4 ADB. 2008.

Regional Analysis in the Philippines. ERD Working Paper. No. 112. \nManila: ADB. \n ", "2  \nwith inequality and poverty of income, progress is also lagging toward MDG targets for universal \nprimary education, maternal mortality, and access to reproductive health.  Government efforts to \naddress multidimensional poverty and vulnerability have been undercut by low spending\u2014in \nparticular for social protection programs, which accounted for only 1.6% of gross domestic \nproduct in 2005, though it rose to 2.3% in 2009, partly in response to global shocks.6 The social \nprotection sector has been characterized by a lack of policy and institutional coherency and \ncoordination  (with  scarce  resources  divided  across  various  fractured  and  often  ineffective \nprograms). Existing programs are often characterized by weak beneficiary targeting systems: \ne.g., leakage rates (shares of beneficiaries who are non-poor) have been estimated at about \n71% for National Food Authority rice subsidies, 29% for food-for-school programs, and 24% for \nthe sponsored program under the National Health Insurance Program (PhilHealth).7    \n \n4.  To  address  these  challenges,  the  government  has  initiated  an  accelerated  social \nprotection policy reform agenda. Spearheaded by the DSWD, this centers on (i) expanding the \n4Ps and improving delivery mechanisms, including governance systems and monitoring and \nevaluation; (ii) extending the NHTS-PR as a tool to improve the targeting of other poverty-\nrelated programs; and (iii) securing adequate and predictable financing for social protection by \nconsolidating programs and gradually expanding overall budget allocations. Building on and \ncomplementing recent and ongoing support by ADB and other agencies, the proposed TA \ndirectly supports this reform agenda by helping the government to (i) formulate and implement \nan action plan for rationalization and convergence of social protection programs;8 (ii) bolster \nnational and local institutional capacity to support the social protection reform agenda; and \n(iii) establish a graduation policy for poor 4P beneficiary households and a referral system to link \nthem to other programs. By addressing leakage, inefficiency, and misalignment under currently \nfractured social protection programs, rationalization and convergence will be critical to ensuring \nan effective and sustainable social protection system that provides a safety net against short-\nterm vulnerabilities, while supporting human capital accumulation and breaking longer-term \nvicious  cycles  of  poverty.  This  will  be  important  for  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  enhance \ngovernance and deliver on its commitments to poverty reduction, and ensure that all segments \nof society benefit from growth.9 \n \n5.  The TA will provide a flexible package of support to the DSWD and other government \nagencies to support policy dialogue across multiple stakeholders, develop and build cross-\nagency consensus behind an action plan of priority reform interventions, and build capacities at \ndifferent tiers of government to directly support operationalization of those interventions. It will \nembed  lessons  from  regional  and  global  good  practice,  and  be  implemented  in  close \ncoordination with other development partners (para. 9). Flexibility in design is justified to allow \nresponsiveness  and  to  tailor-fit  policy  support  in  a  sensitive  and  rapidly  evolving  policy \nenvironment,  build  in  strong  government  ownership,  and  ensure  symbiosis  with  emerging \nsupport  from  other  development  partners.  The  DSWD  will  ensure  close  coordination  and \nalignment between the TA and existing and emerging support from the Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the  World  Bank, \nUnited  Nations  agencies,  and  other  development  partners  through  a  new  DSWD-chaired \ncoordinating body on international TA that will convene in early 2011. \n                                                 \n6 Social protection expenditure figures here are defined to include social assistance and social insurance.

Impact and Outcome \n6.  The long-term impact supported by the TA will be improved coverage of social protection \nand  social  services  for  the  poor.  The  TA\u2019s  outcome  will  be  enhanced  efficiency  and \nsustainability of the social protection system. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will have three core outputs: (i) national policy reforms for social protection \ndeveloped, (ii) capacity of national and local institutions to support the social protection reform \nagenda  developed,  and  (iii)  referral  system  and  graduation  policy  for  4Ps  beneficiaries \nestablished. \n \n8.  Output 1: National policy reforms for social protection developed. As its central \noutput,  the  TA  will  assist  the  continued  development  of  national  policy  reforms  for  social \nprotection, culminating in the formulation and launch of a concrete action plan for reforms for \nrationalization and convergence of social protection programs, consolidating effective programs \nwhile phasing out those that are ineffective. Expert advice\u2014via consultants as well as flexibly \ndeployed resource persons with expertise in specific fields (para. 14)\u2014will help the government \nto identify key medium- and longer-term policy reforms. Together, these will support increased \nand more efficient budget allocation for social protection, enhanced program targeting and \ndelivery, and enhanced efficiency and sustainability of the social protection system overall.   \n \n9.  Following a rapid institutional analysis of the social protection sector, the TA will support \nan in-depth critical review of the social protection sector and its existing policy framework, \nprograms,  and  agency  roles,  including  directions  set  in  the  forthcoming  Medium-Term \nPhilippines  Development  Program.  Deliverables  will  include  (i)  a  comprehensive  report \nreviewing the social protection sector and policy framework for social protection, providing \nrecommendations for consolidation and rationalization;10 (ii) supplementary policy briefs focused \non specific proposals for short- and longer-term reforms; (iii) an action plan for rationalization \nand coordination of social protection programs, including concrete steps and milestones and \nembedding  mechanisms  for  improved  targeting  and  gender  mainstreaming;  (iv)  DSWD \nendorsement of core recommendations, as well as adoption and launch of the action plan; and \n(v) establishment of a social protection reform panel to support cross-agency dialogue on social \nprotection-related issues. The action plan and broader recommendations for reform will be \nformulated via extensive cross-agency dialogue and consensus building, including a series of \nworkshops and policy forums. The TA will also involve close coordination with support from \nother development partners, which may include joint policy forums. A knowledge dissemination \nand communication plan will be drafted early in the TA, to support effective dialogue and \ndissemination of TA deliverables.   \n \n10.  Output  2:  Capacity  of  national  and  local  institutions  to  support  the  social \nprotection reform agenda developed. The TA will selectively support multimodal capacity \ndevelopment to enable implementation of the reform action plan formulated under output 1.  \nInterventions will be tailored to address critical institutional and capacity gaps identified through \nthe  institutional  assessment,  ranging  from  formal  training  courses  to  mentoring  and \ndevelopment and provision of print and information and communication technology materials.  \n                                                 \n10 This will include synthesizing evidence from rigorous impact evaluation of the 4Ps that will be supported by ADB, \nthe Australian Agency for International Development, and the World Bank; available assessments of the NHTS-PR; \nand broader analysis of the efficacy of major social protection-related programs. The TA will also support focused \nauxiliary data collection and analysis as needed.    \n ", "4  \nEmphasis will be given to enhancing mechanisms and building applied capacities within the \nDSWD system (with secondary support for other line agencies as needed) to support effective \nimplementation of the noted action plan for rationalization and coordination of social protection \nprograms. Interventions will also be coordinated, with capacity development focused principally \non the 4Ps and NHTS-PR under ongoing support from ADB and other development partners.  \nSpecific deliverables will include (i) formulation and DSWD adoption and implementation of a \ncapacity development plan, which will ensure gender-inclusiveness; and (ii) applied capacities \nbuilt at central and subnational levels to support implementation of the social protection action \nplan as well as key broader reforms. \n \n11.  Output 3: Referral system and graduation policy for 4Ps beneficiaries established.  \nComplementing support for macro-level policy reforms, the final output will operationalize the \nrationalization agenda at the beneficiary level. In particular, it will assist develop mechanisms to \n(i) track 4Ps beneficiaries and facilitate their referral to other existing resources to help them \nescape  poverty  (e.g.,  rural  development  programs,  training,  employment  generation,  etc.); \n(ii) strengthen  coordination  among  currently  stand-alone  programs  in  these  areas;  and \n(iii) facilitate the graduation of 4Ps beneficiary households that have exited poverty. These \nmechanisms  will  provide  a  key  operational-level  link  between  the  4Ps  and  a  streamlined \npackage of broader poverty-related programs promoted under output 1. Specific deliverables \nwill include (i) formulation and pilot testing of a referral system, and development of a plan for \nthe referral system\u2019s broader rollout within the 4Ps program; and (ii) development and DSWD \nadoption of a graduation policy for 4Ps beneficiary households.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.7 million equivalent. It is proposed that \n$1.4 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.11 The \nGovernment of the Philippines will finance the remaining $300,000 equivalent (in kind) as \ncounterpart  support,  including  office  accommodation  for  consultants;  and  transportation, \nremuneration, and per diem for counterpart staff. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented from January 2011 to January 2013. The DSWD will act as \nthe executing agency, and will facilitate continuity with the ongoing ADB loan and TAs noted in \npara. 1. Within the government, the DSWD has the central mandate for social protection and \nother social welfare and development programs. It directly oversees implementation of the \nNHTS-PR and 4Ps. It is spearheading the government\u2019s new social protection reform agenda, \nand is chair of the Social Protection Subcommittee of the National Economic Development \nAuthority Social Development Committee.12 To enhance ownership and promote effective cross-\nagency dialogue. The TA will engage other government agencies involved in social protection \nreform via this Subcommittee.  The TA will not establish a separate steering committee. It will \nalso provide support to set up a high-level social protection reform panel of eminent persons \nfrom both the public and the private sectors to help guide reform efforts. Finally, to support \nlinkages to and harmonization with other international assistance, TA-supported interventions \nwill be developed and implemented in close coordination with development partners, including \nthrough the DSWD-chaired coordination body for TA-related support (para. 5).  \n \n                                                 \n11 Administered by ADB. \n12 The subcommittee includes the DSWD, the National Economic Development Authority, and other key agencies \nsuch as the National Anti-Poverty Commission, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health. ", "                               5\n14.  The TA will flexibly deploy an array of expert inputs to provide timely and needs-tailored \nsupport for policy dialogue and rollout of the action plan for social protection convergence and \nrationalization. First, a core team of consultants (indicatively comprising 20 person-months of \ninternational and 12 person-months of national expert inputs) will be recruited using individual \nconsultant selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time).13 An international social protection specialist will act as team leader \nand  overall  TA  coordinator,  overseeing  and  coordinating  inputs  from  the  remaining  core \nconsultants\u2014indicatively a social protection finance specialist and national social development \nand gender specialist.14 The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \nSecond, complementing the core team of consultants, ADB will flexibly mobilize short-term \nresource persons to draft technical notes and policy briefs and present at policy forums, review \nand augment draft reports, and provide other focused inputs in specific policy and reform areas. \nFinally, capacity development activities will be contracted out to reputable training institutions \nand individuals, as needed.   \n \n15.  The consultants will report to ADB, closely consulting the DSWD on policy-related issues \nincluding agreement on a detailed work plan and formulation of the pilot referral system. Drafts \nof major reports and technical and policy briefs will be jointly reviewed by ADB and the DSWD, \nand will incorporate close dialogue with other relevant agencies. To enhance their impact, \nreports, technical and policy briefs, and other deliverables will be discussed and disseminated \nby a variety of means, including in-country workshops, electronic reports, website publication, \nand other means, which will be laid out in a knowledge dissemination and communication plan.   \n \n16.  Costs for central level and certain subnational seminars and workshops will generally be \nadministered by the lead consultant (based on close dialogue with ADB and the DSWD), with \nother subnational or local activities administered by the DSWD, and certain training programs \ncontracted to training institutions. The DSWD will organize and oversee implementation of the \nreferral  system  pilot  in  selected  localities,  with  focused  technical  inputs  as  needed  from \nconsultants and/or resource persons. The consultants will develop and conduct monitoring and \nevaluation of the pilot test (including baseline and endline surveys), providing an assessment of \nits overall efficacy and recommendations for refinements and planning for its expansion.   \n \n17.  All procurement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  Equipment  procured  under  the  TA  (including  principally \ncomputers, peripherals, and software to support training, materials development, and other \nactivities) will become the property of the DSWD upon TA completion. All disbursements under \nthe TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). To facilitate effective implementation of certain activities, \nADB may establish an advance payment facility for DSWD and/or other agencies or institutions, \nas needed.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,400,000  to  the \nGovernment of the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Support for Social Protection Reform, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n13 The need for possible additional consultancy inputs will be reviewed following completion of the institutional \nassessment and/or during the midterm review. \n14 Subject to ADB approval, the consultants will also mobilize, train, and oversee additional field-based research staff, \ndata analysts, etc. \n ", "6 Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and   \nSummary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2018:     \nImproved coverage of    Data published by  Risks \nsocial protection and  MDG 1: Proportion of  National Statistical  Other determinants of \nsocial services for the  population below national  Coordination Board  income, consumption, and \npoor  poverty threshold less than    vulnerability are not present \n25% (2006 baseline: 33%)  DSWD evaluations and  (e.g., political and economic \n  MIS data  stability) \nShare of households \nCountry corruption risks \nvulnerable to falling into \npoverty below 30% (2005 \nbaseline: 45%) \n \nShare of poor households \ncovered by 4Ps of conditional \ncash transfers reaches 50% \n(baseline = 20% at end of \n2010), of whom at least half \nare effectively linked to \ncommunity-driven \ndevelopment and/or \nemployment programs \nOutcome  By TA completion:     Assumptions \nEnhanced efficiency and    Data published by  Political and financial \nsustainability of the  The NHTS-PR is applied to at  National Statistical  support for social protection \nsocial protection system  least three major national  Coordination Board  reform is maintained. \nsocial protection programs.    \nAccuracy and objectivity of \n  DSWD MIS data and \nNHTS-PR database reliably \nSocial protection spending  evaluation studies, with \nmaintained \nreaches 2.8% of gross  sex-disaggregated data \ndomestic product (baseline:   \n2.3% in 2009)  Social protection index \nOutputs       Risks \n1.

The  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  directly \nsupport the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD; the executing agency) and \nthe Government of the Philippines in advancing its reform agenda for social protection. It will \n(i) support formulation and implementation of an action plan for rationalization and convergence of \nsocial protection programs, (ii) bolster national and local institutional capacity to support the social \nprotection reform agenda, and (iii) establish a graduation policy for poor beneficiary households \nunder the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps; the Building Bridges for the Filipino Family \nProgram) of conditional cash transfers and a referral system to link them to other programs.   \n \n2.  Among these, the TA will provide particular emphasis to supporting reforms aimed at \nrationalization  and  convergence.  Convergence  will  include  enhancing  alignment  and  linkages \nbetween programs under the DSWD, including particularly (i) the 4Ps; (ii) the DSWD\u2019s community-\ndriven development program (Kalahi-Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services), \nwhich  tackles  poverty  by  providing  small  grants  for  community-level  infrastructure  and  social \nservices that are selected and overseen by communities; and (iii) the Self-Employment Assistance-\nKaunlaran  program,  which  assists  the  poor  to  escape  from  poverty  through  small-scale \nentrepreneurial activities. It also includes extension of the national household targeting system for \npoverty reduction to provide a nationwide database for poverty targeting by various national and \nlocal social protection and poverty reduction programs.1  Finally, in combination with rationalization \nand downsizing or phase-out of ineffective programs,   convergence aims at enhancing alignment \nacross a potentially smaller number of social protection-related programs under various agencies. \nRationalization and convergence reforms will be critically important to enhancing the efficacy and \nsustainability of the Philippines social protection sector (by allowing resources to be concentrated \nin a smaller number of more efficient and more effectively aligned programs), but will be complex \nand particularly challenging. The TA will thus need to mobilize considerable expert advice and \nother support for policy dialogue and consensus building.   \n \n3.  The  TA  will  engage  international  and  national  experts  to  introduce  international  best \npractice,  promote  policy  dialogue  across  government  and  nongovernment  stakeholders,  and \nsupport  the  implementation  of  various  activities.  Subject  to  potential  adjustment  following \ncompletion  of  the  institutional  assessment  and/or  during  the  TA\u2019s  midterm  review,  the  core \nconsultant team will consist of three experts, providing the inputs outlined below. Consultants will \nbe recruited as individuals by ADB in dialogue with the DSWD, and will report jointly to ADB and \nthe DSWD. Formal consultant inputs will be augmented by short-term resource persons and other \ntask-specific experts, who will provide focused expertise in specific areas of social protection \nthrough drafting or reviewing and augmenting policy notes, presentations to policy forums and \nother workshops, and other means. Following assessment of priority capacity gaps that obstruct \nimplementation of targeted social protection reforms, the consultants will also help identify and \ncoordinate with training institutions and/or individuals as needed to carry out certain activities under \na capacity development plan. \n \n4.  In addition to development of materials to support capacity development, the consultants\u2019 \nprincipal written outputs will include (i) a rapid institutional assessment; (ii) a comprehensive report \nreviewing the social protection sector and policy framework for social protection and providing \nrecommendations for rationalization and convergence; (iii) supplementary technical and policy \n                                                 \n1 While not yet fully operationalized, a March 2010 executive order requires all government agencies to use the national \nhousehold targeting system for poverty reduction for household targeting of poor households in their programs. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nbriefs2 elaborating on specific reform recommendations in the short and longer terms; and (iv) an \naction plan for rationalization and coordination of social protection programs, including concrete \nsteps  and  milestones  and  embedding  mechanisms  for  improved  targeting  and  gender \nmainstreaming. Reports will emphasize technical content and feed-in to reform-related activities \n(rather than administrative reporting), and will be reviewed by ADB, the DSWD, and other relevant \nagencies. Specific needs for technical and policy briefs will be determined during implementation.  \nKnowledge,  lessons  learned,  and  TA  outputs  will  be  disseminated  through  workshops  and \npublications.  \n \nA.
