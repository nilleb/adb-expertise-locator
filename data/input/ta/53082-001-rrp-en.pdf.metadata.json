THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) for the Ebeye Solid Waste Management Project. \n \n2.  The project will establish a sustainable and effective solid waste management (SWM) \nsystem in Ebeye by (i) building a high-temperature incinerator and upgrading the dump site,  \n(ii) upgrading and replacing equipment for municipal SWM, and (iii) strengthening institutional \ncapacity to sustain SWM services. The project will help prevent the spread of transmissible \ndiseases, including the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and waterborne diseases, through \nimproved medical waste disposal and strengthened medical waste management capacity. A \nproject-readiness financing grant was approved in 2019 to prepare the project and expedite the \nsmooth transition to project implementation.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The RMI, in the northern Pacific Ocean, is composed of 29 coral atolls and 5 coral islands \nand has a population of about 53,000. The RMI is highly vulnerable to natural hazards and climate \nchange impacts. It is classified as a fragile and conflict-affected situation.2 Unemployment is high \nand human development indicators are generally low. The RMI is heavily dependent on external \nassistance, with annual grants averaging about 60% of gross domestic product, mostly from the \nUnited States (US). RMI citizens can live and work in the US without a visa under the RMI\u2019s Compact \nof Free Association with the US, and a significant portion of the working-age population leaves the \nRMI to pursue opportunities in the US. As a result, the RMI has a younger population than the rest \nof the Pacific. Ebeye, on Kwajalein Atoll, is the second-largest urban center in the RMI and one \nof the most densely populated places in the world, with about 10,000 people living in 0.31 square \nkilometers, placing pressures on urban services and creating social challenges.3 Because of \nsubstantial migration to the US, the population of Ebeye increased by only 0.4% per annum in 1999\u2013\n2011.4 The island has no airport and most visitors arrive through the US Army Garrison Kwajalein \nAtoll. The US base is the major employer of Ebeye residents; other jobs are limited because of the \nlack of any industry. With the ongoing support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Ebeye \nresidents receive improved water supply and sanitation services.5 Municipal SWM, however, \nremains one of the most serious challenges. \n \n4.  Waste generation and collection. Kwajalein Atoll Local Government (KALGOV) collects \nmunicipal solid waste (household, commercial, and office) 6 days a week. At least one garbage \nbin is provided to each household and waste from a household is collected 2\u20133 times a week. \nThe solid waste is a mixture of food and organic waste, plastic, paper, metal, diapers, textile, and \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nother waste.6 KALGOV collects about 8\u201312 tons per day of municipal solid waste, or 0.8\u20131.2 \nkilograms per person, and transports it to the only dump site in the island, without charging the \nusers.7 KALGOV collects and disposes of most generated waste (90%); only a small portion is \nreused, as feed for livestock or as firewood. With financial support from donors, KALGOV has \nmanaged to provide basic municipal solid waste collection services, and it is planning to develop \nan SWM tariff framework to collect fees for SWM.8  \n \n5.  Dump site and equipment. Operated by KALGOV since 2005, the only dump site covers \n1.6 hectares in the north end of the island or about 5% of Ebeye. However, collected waste is \npiled randomly inside the site without any compacting. The dump site is a prime location for \nmosquito breeding, which led to a major outbreak of dengue fever in 2019.9 It is an environmental \nnuisance and leachate pollutes the lagoon. The dump site is in danger of being inundated because \nof sea-level rise resulting from climate change. It needs to be upgraded to a managed landfill if \nits life is to be extended. Waste collection and management vehicles and equipment operated by \nKALGOV are inadequate, and often severely damaged or not functional. The operating lifetime of \nsuch equipment is shortened by the harsh marine environment and lack of adequate and timely \nmaintenance. The lack of replacement parts exacerbates the problem. KALGOV needs to develop \nand implement asset management with sufficient financing to maintain equipment performance. \n \n6.  Recycling in Ebeye and the solid waste management plan. To encourage recycling \nand reduce littering, the RMI introduced the Container Disposal Legislation (CDL) system in 2018. \nThe CDL bans some single-use plastic products and introduced a refunding system for beverage \ncontainers so they can be sent to the Majuro Atoll Waste Company for recycling. While the \nnecessary law and regulations are in place, KALGOV has not been able to implement the CDL.10 \nKALGOV approved the Kwajalein Atoll SWM Plan in 2018, which includes an integrated action \nplan for 2019\u20132023, to (i) improve waste reduction and recycling through the CDL, (ii) manage \nand improve the current final disposal dump site, (iii) sustain the operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of waste collection services, and (iv) improve the financial sustainability of SWM services. \nThese actions require substantial investment. Given the scarcity of land available for a new \nlandfill, KALGOV should take measures to reduce waste volume, extend the lifetime of the \nexisting dump site, and achieve sustainable and effective SWM. \n \n7.  Medical waste management. Ebeye Hospital is the only hospital in Ebeye, with 45 beds \nand 80 staff members, serving the population of the Kwajalein Atoll.11 In 2014, the Secretariat of \nthe Pacific Regional Environment Programme conducted a detailed study on medical waste \nmanagement in the hospital, and the result showed that the system failed to meet most standards, \nsuch as having a waste management policy or a training plan for the staff.12 To improve its \n \n6  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2016.

While medical waste is segregated and managed by the contractor at a small \ntemporary incineration unit, safety standards for handling and transporting medical waste need to \nbe improved. The incinerator has limited capacity and performs to low environmental standards. \nThe hospital needs assistance to reduce environmental and health hazards. \n \n8.  COVID-19  outbreak  and  impact.  The  RMI  imposed  strict  travel  restrictions  and \nquarantine requirements early on that had been effective in keeping the country free of COVID-\n19 until the end of October. However, the country\u2019s first two border cases of COVID-19 have been \nidentified in the US base on the Kwajalein Atoll on 27 October 2020. Once the country reopens, \nthe RMI will be further at risk of the rapid spread of COVID-19 because of the weak public health \nsystem. The RMI has received a large amount of personal protective equipment and medical \ngoods for precautions and testing. In Ebeye, medical waste has increased significantly because \nof COVID-19 testing and prevention; globally, the amount of infectious medical waste has been \nincreasing rapidly, overwhelming medical transport and disposal infrastructure.13 Additional waste \nmanagement systems must be put in place to help manage the impact of COVID-19 and the \nemergence of other diseases. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n9.  The government requested assistance from ADB to implement the Kwajalein Atoll SWM \nPlan for the proposed project, which is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for \n11 small Pacific island countries, 2020\u20132022.14 The project will contribute to goals 5, 10, 11, 12, \nand  13  of  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  by  reducing  waste  pollution  in  Ebeye  and \nprotecting the ocean from waste pollution.15 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nspecifically operational priorities (OPs) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.16 The project is consistent with the \nstrategic priorities of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2016\u20132020 to manage risk and enable value \ncreation  through  urban  infrastructure  investment  and  ADB\u2019s  Oceans  Financing  Initiative.17 \nFollowing other ADB support to the RMI in response to COVID-19, the project will reduce the \nenvironmental and health hazard of increased medical waste during the COVID-19 pandemic.18 \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: efficient, effective, resilient, sustainable, \nand affordable services and facilities that promote sustainable economic growth provided.19 The \nproject will have the following outcome: coverage and sustainability of integrated SWM service \ndelivery improved in Ebeye. The project aims to improve the coverage of the sustainable SWM \nservices to at least 8,400 people (85% of the population) in Ebeye, including at least 4,200 women \n(85% of the female population). Focusing on integrated municipal SWM and aligned with the \nKwajalein Atoll SWM Plan, the project will have three outputs: 20 \n \n13  ADB. 2020.

Output 1: A high-temperature incinerator constructed, and waste disposal site and \nrecycling facility upgraded. The project will accomplish the following:  \n(i)  Upgrade the existing dump site and construct a seawall along the site\u2019s shoreline. \nThe dump site will be converted to a managed landfill for installation and operation \nof the incinerator and disposal of the bottom ash and construction waste. Existing \nsolid waste will be shaped into a mound and covered with a layer of material in \naccordance with the RMI SWM regulations. The seawall to be constructed in the \nwestern and northern part of the dump site will be about 270 meters long and stop \ninundation and prevent solid waste from polluting the lagoon.  \n(ii)   Construct a high-temperature incinerator capable of burning 9\u201313 tons a day in the \nlandfill site using a design\u2013build\u2013manage contract. The incinerator will process all \nthe municipal solid waste in Ebeye and generate bottom ash. The contractor will \nbe responsible for the performance of the incinerator and the training of the \nKALGOV staff. KALGOV will undertake the daily operation and the contractor will \nprovide remote monitoring and management. In response to COVID-19, the project \nwill  ensure  that  the  incinerator  will  process  hazardous  medical  waste  and \nmenstrual waste properly. \n(iii)   Construct a recycling facility house in the landfill site to store recycling equipment \nprocured by KALGOV.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Municipal solid waste collection, transport, and  disposal operations \nimproved. The project will (i) upgrade and replace vehicles and equipment for solid waste \ncollection, transport, and disposal; and (ii) replace waste collection containers for more efficient \noperation. KALGOV will adopt cost-effective procurement to ensure the sustainability of vehicles \nand equipment, such as a multiyear maintenance and repair service agreement for the purchased \nequipment. In response to COVID-19, specific equipment and supplies will be procured in a timely \nmanner for safe medical waste management, including waste classification, segregation, storage, \ntransport, and disposal. The project will help Ebeye Hospital and its contractor strengthen the \nexisting medical waste management system, starting from the period before construction until the \noperation of the incinerator, including the first 12 months of project implementation. \n \n13.  Output 3: Institutional capacity to sustain solid waste management service delivery \nand local engagement strengthened. The project will accomplish the following:  \n(i)  Improve the technical capacity of KALGOV, develop and implement a waste \ncollection and transport plan,21 develop and implement an operation plan for the \nmanaged waste landfill, and formulate and implement an asset management plan \nfor vehicles and equipment for waste management. The asset management plan \nwill cover O&M of equipment and provisions to secure funding for O&M and capital \nequipment replacement, and build KALGOV\u2019s capacity KALGOV to implement the \nCDL.  \n(ii)  Improve KALGOV\u2019s financial sustainability to maintain the services. The project \nwill  develop  and  implement  a  gender-sensitive  institutional  reform  plan  for \nKALGOV,  including  actions to support  women  in  leadership  and/or technical \npositions, and help KALGOV develop and implement the SWM tariff framework. \nAs practiced in many countries, an SMW tariff can be charged and collected with \nthe electricity tariff, which exists in Ebeye and has a high collection ratio.  \n \n21 Collection operations to be reviewed include operational and safety procedures for collection workers. The plan \ncovers disaster risk management, including measures to be taken in response to inundation and overtopping. \n ", "5 \n(iii)  Conduct  a  gender-sensitive  public-awareness  campaign  on  \u201creduce,  reuse, \nrecycle,\u201d and increase public understanding of the importance of paying fees for \nsustainability.  \n \n14.  In response to COVID-19, the project will start strengthening institutional capacities for \nproper  handling  and  management  of  medical  waste  within  the  first  12  months  of  project \nimplementation. The project will review the current medical waste management procedures, roles \nand responsibilities, and budget of Ebeye Hospital; develop new medical waste management \nprocedures  for  the  hospital;  and  design  and  implement  training  for  the  hospital  staff  and \ncontractors who handle medical waste. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s value added includes (i) bringing project-readiness financing to accelerate project \nreadiness and build the project implementation capacity of KALGOV and Ministry of Works, \nInfrastructure,  and  Utilities  (MWIU);  (ii)  strengthening  gender  mainstreaming  and  KALGOV \ncapacity building; and (iii) dealing with medical waste related to COVID-19 in a timely manner. \nLessons from previous ADB operations in the urban sector have been incorporated into the \nproject design, including the importance of (i) highlighting financial and technical sustainability,  \n(ii) ensuring that climate-proof designs are adopted, and (iii) ensuring urban service demand and \nwillingness to pay. SWM is a major issue in most island countries. The project will set up \nintegrated SWM, including waste recycling and a pilot sustainable small-scale incinerator. If the \nproject is successful, ADB will work with island country governments to expand integrated SWM \nin the Pacific, covering ocean waste management and contributing to ocean health initiatives. \n \nD.

Costs for (i) the construction of a seawall, (ii) management of stormwater at the site,  \n(iii) organization and covering of existing waste, and (iv) construction of the metal beam structure \non which the incinerator is to be built are considered adaptation financing (footnote 22). \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($'000)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \n  Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund)a  6,500  92.0 \nGovernment  567  8.0 \nTotal  7,067  100.0 \na  Of the $6,500,000 funded by the Asian Development Fund, $1,500,000 will be funded through the corporate pool for \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) responses. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The Ministry of Finance, Banking, and Postal Services will be the executing agency for the \nproject, and MWIU will be the implementing agency.23 A project implementation unit (PIU) \ncomposed of officials from MWIU will be set up to manage day-to-day project activities, including \nprocurement of civil works, materials and equipment, and consulting services. \n \n20.  COVID-19. The country\u2019s borders have been closed since March 2020 in response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic\u2019s duration is uncertain, but the reopening of the country is \nenvisaged to be in stages. The government has prioritized the project to help manage the impact \nof COVID-19 and support economic recovery. The 7-year implementation period will provide \nsome  flexibility  for  delays  in  access  to  the  RMI  and  supply  chains.  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2021\u2013December 2027 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2027 \nEstimated grant closing date  30 June 2028 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committeea \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance, Banking, and Postal Services \n(iii) Implementing agency  Ministry of Works, Infrastructure, and Utilities \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project implementation unit: \n(i) head: secretary of works, infrastructure, and utilities; \n(ii) project implementation assistance consultant; \n(iii) financial management specialist (consultant); and \n(iv) construction monitoring consultant.  \nMWIU may allocate additional personnel to the Project Implementation \nUnit from its staff as needed and if staff members are available. \n \n23 In light of the continuity from the project readiness financing, MWIU is identified as the implementing agency. \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  2 contracts  $3.40 million \nRequest for quotations  4 contracts  $0.68 million \nConsulting Services  ICS  100 person-months  $1.64 million \n  QCBS  1 contract  $0.08 million \nAdvance contracting  Goods and works, and consulting services \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; ICS = individual consultant selection; KALGOV = Kwajalein Atoll Local Government; \nMWIU = Ministry of Works, Infrastructure, and Utilities; PIU = project implementation unit; QCBS = quality- and cost-\nbased selection. \na  Comprising representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Banking, and Postal Services; the Ministry of Works, \nInfrastructure, and Utilities; the Kwajalein Atoll Local Government; the Environmental Protection Authority; and civil \nsociety. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The project design represents a technically viable approach to SWM based on various \ndonors\u2019  feasibility  studies,  technology  alternatives,  cost  estimates,  and  site  investigations. \nIntegrated SWM is recommended to adequately extend the lifetime of the landfill, sustain the \nSWM service, and minimize the impact on ocean health. The incinerator will reduce solid waste \nvolume by about 95% and weight by 80%. As the thermal combustion of the waste in a controlled \nenvironment  prevents  the  release  of  methane  into  the  atmosphere,  which  occurs  during \ndecomposition of organic waste at the dump site, incineration will significantly reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions (GHG) and, therefore, has considerable environmental benefits. The incinerator\u2019s \ncapacity will be greater than existing solid waste production. Such capacity will provide flexibility \nto combust more solid waste if the urban population increases or it becomes necessary to reduce \nvolume of existing waste at the site. Comparing the current disposal at the dump site, Incineration \nof the present quantity of waste will reduce GHG emissions by about 73% or 2,688 tons carbon \ndioxide equivalent annually.24 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n22.  Economic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is solid, as \nthe  project  will  provide  sustainable  urban  basic  SWM  services.  A  least-cost  analysis  was \nconducted instead of a cost\u2013benefit analysis because quantifying the project\u2019s economic benefits \nwas difficult.25 The assumed alternative was that KALGOV would transport waste to Majuro as \nthe Ebeye dump site could no longer take in additional waste. This option presupposes that \nMajuro has either a managed landfill or a high-temperature incinerator, although it has neither. \nUsing a 6.0% discount rate deemed appropriate for a project with significant environmental \nbenefits and in a small, fragile island economy, the least-cost analysis indicated that the project \nis the least-cost option. The analysis noted that the project will yield significant unquantifiable \nbenefits such as reduced incidence of diseases, translating to avoided medical costs and lost \nproductivity; environmental improvements, including greenhouse gas emissions and benefits from \nupgraded handling of hazardous medical waste; and additional income from service charges and \nresale of recyclable materials recovered during waste collection. \n \n24 KfW\u2019s Solid Waste Management Greenhouse Gas Calculator was used to estimate GHG emissions for incineration \nand to compare the emissions with the current situation base case.  \n25 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \n23.  Financial analysis. A financial analysis was conducted for the project in accordance with \nADB\u2019s guidelines.26 While the project will support the establishment of a waste tariff framework \nenabling KALGOV to collect fees and cover part of O&M costs, KALGOV can fully cover the \nincremental O&M costs over the incinerator\u2019s 15-year useful life only assuming that KALGOV \nreceives continued financial support from the national government (sourced from US grants under \nthe Compact of Free Association), the Kwajalein Impact Fund, and other potential funding \nsources.27 Substantial risk accrues to project financial sustainability, arising from (i) insufficient \ntariff revenue for O&M; and (ii) dependence on limited national budgetary allocations and external \ngrants, and changing national priorities. To mitigate this risk, regular annual budget allocations \nfor O&M costs need to be allocated by the central government. ADB will provide continuous \nsupport under the project to build KALGOV\u2019s financial management capacity. \n \nC.  Sustainability and Climate Change \n \n24.  Sustainable operation and maintenance. The O&M responsibility for the incinerator will \nbe shared by KALGOV and the contractor, which will build KALGOV\u2019s capacity and minimize the \ncontractor\u2019s personnel requirement. Building the KALGOV staff\u2019s capacity related to, and raising \nthe  public\u2019s  awareness  of,  integrated  SWM  will  strengthen  the  SWM  chain  for  long-term \nsustainability. The government will undertake regular and periodic maintenance of the project \nfacilities in accordance with the project\u2019s asset management plan and make adequate resources \navailable through budgetary allocations for O&M of the project facilities. \n \n25.  Climate and climate change resilience. Given the island\u2019s exposure to the sea, sea-\nlevel rise, and climatic hazards, a climate risk assessment was prepared.28 To ensure the \ntechnical sustainability of the infrastructure, climate and climate change\u2013proofed approaches will \nbe embedded in the project. A seawall will be built to adapt to sea-level rise, protect infrastructure, \nand prevent solid waste from sliding into the lagoon. Climate and climate change hazards will be \nthoroughly analyzed as part of the detailed design. Climate and disaster risk measures will be \nincorporated into the waste collection and transport plan under output 3. If successful, the project \nwill help expand integrated SWM to the Pacific and contribute to ADB\u2019s Action Plan for Healthy \nOceans and Sustainable Blue Economies.29 \n \nD.  Governance \n \n26.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  June  and  July  2020,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management Technical Guidance Note and Financial Due \nDiligence: A Methodology Note.30 The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is high \nmainly because of the key risks for project implementation, such as limited staff resources, high \nstaff turnover, weak capacity, inadequate financial management system, and lack of internal audit \ncapacity. To mitigate these risks, a dedicated PIU will be established for day-to-day project \nimplementation and management. The MWIU secretary will be the PIU head and certify all eligible \npayments (invoices and progress claims). A project implementation assistance consultant, a \nfinancial management specialist, and a construction monitoring consultant will be recruited to staff \n \n26 ADB. 2019.

An external auditor will be recruited to audit project accounts and prepare audited \nproject financial statements. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  discussed  with  the \ngovernment and the Ministry of Finance, Banking, and Postal Services. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  The project is classified as having effective gender mainstreaming. Overall, women are \nlargely responsible for managing household waste and the negative health and environmental \nimpacts of poor waste management (e.g., caring for sick family members). Menstrual hygiene and \nmenstrual waste disposal are considered taboo and rarely discussed. Women\u2019s labor force \nparticipation is low, with only 26% of women working for pay compared with 48% of men. Women \nare largely employed in finance and administrative roles and few in technical roles. No women \nwork in technical roles in KALGOV. A gender action plan has been developed to ensure women\u2019s \nparticipation in the project and access to project benefits.31 Gender design features include \nprovision of continuous solid waste collection services for at least 8,400 people in Ebeye and \nsurrounding communities, including at least 4,200 women and  200 households headed by \nwomen. A new solid waste collection and disposal operation plan will deal with women\u2019s and girls\u2019 \nissues and recommendations, including menstrual hygiene and waste management. The gender \naction plan will include women in SWM training, encourage them to apply for new positions, and \nhire and train them in KALGOV during project operations. Raising high school girl students\u2019 \nawareness of menstrual health and hygiene will be emphasized. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follow:32 \n \n30.  Environment (category B). The project is expected to bring significant positive impacts, \nincluding improved public health, because of reduced odor and vector-borne diseases; cleaner \nnear-field marine waters because of better managed stormwater runoff and reduced waste at the \ndump site; and improved integrated waste management through better operational control and \ndisposal of solid waste. The project\u2019s major civil works components, comprising improved landfill \noperations and introduction of a high-temperature incinerator system, are consistent with the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  RMI  environmental  regulations.33 \nThe impacts of civil works are site-specific, largely limited to the construction footprint, and can \nbe mitigated and managed to acceptable levels, provided the measures identified in the initial \n \n31 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n33 The rated heat input capacities of incinerators considered for the project are below the range required by the \nInternational Finance Corporation\u2019s Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines (2007). The European Union's \nguidelines on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants note that \"the emission limit values set out in Annex II \nshould not apply to medium combustion plants located in the Canary Islands, French Overseas Departments, the \nAzores and Madeira, because of the technical and logistical issues associated with such plants' isolated location.\" \nThis note will apply to the RMI.

The EMP requirements and provisions for environmental protection and management \nwill  be  incorporated  into  the  bid  documents  for  civil  works  and  the  construction  contract. \nThe contractors will prepare their construction EMP based on the project EMP, and detail their \nconstruction methodology and approach to the main construction elements, risk assessment, and \nmitigation  measures. 35  Effective  environmental  management,  monitoring,  and  reporting \nresponsibilities will be ensured by PIU environmental experts, who will (i) review and clear the \nconstruction EMP before any physical works start; (ii) regularly monitor compliance to ensure that \nall works are implemented in accordance with the approved initial environmental examination,  \nEMP, and construction EMP; and (iii) report on monitoring results\u2014particularly construction EMP \nimplementation, effectiveness of environmental impact mitigations, and the necessary corrective \nactions\u2014and provide inputs to the project quarterly progress reports and  semiannual safeguard \nmonitoring reports. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will neither require additional land \nacquisition nor have any involuntary resettlement impacts. A due diligence report has been \nprepared.  \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to have impacts on \nindigenous peoples. The project due diligence confirmed that the people of Ebeye do not meet \nthe ADB criteria (distinctiveness and vulnerability) of indigenous peoples; thus, the project will not \ndirectly or indirectly affect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous \npeoples. \n \nG.
