INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In Cambodia, road transport is the dominant mode of transport. Due to the country\u2019s \nrelatively small size, limited access to maritime transport, and small railway network, road \ntransport best meets (i) the domestic need to provide access and rural connectivity, and (ii) the \nregional need to facilitate connectivity and trade within the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).  \n \n2.  During the country programming mission in May 2016, the Ministry of Public Works and \nTransport (MPWT) requested support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in deepening \nsector reform to strengthen road asset management. In early August 2016, ADB and the MPWT \nagreed to (i) prepare required regulatory frameworks to enforce the Law on Road,1 (ii) assess \nand identify how to optimize the MPWT\u2019s organization structure and develop its staff capacity to \nbe able to implement the Law on Road and regulatory and strategic frameworks, and (iii) \ndevelop and strengthen policy and strategic frameworks to help engage the private sector in \nroad maintenance execution and combat vehicle overloading through implementing technical \nassistance (TA).2 \n \n3.  Meetings were held between May and September 2016 with the MPWT, the Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance (MEF), the World Bank, the Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA), and the Embassy of Japan in Cambodia on the concept, scope, TA implementation \narrangements and schedule, terms of reference for consulting services, cost estimates, and \ngovernment contribution to avoid duplication and explore synergies with projects assisted by the \nWorld Bank and JICA. Both JICA and the World Bank supported the TA design and indicated \ntheir collaboration in the implementation of the proposed TA. In September 2016, during the TA \nfact-finding  mission,  the  Government  of  Cambodia  concurred  with  the  TA  implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  of  consultants  to  be \nengaged under the TA. The agreed design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The core development problem in Cambodia\u2019s transport sector is low connectivity and \ninefficiency resulting from an incomplete legal and regulatory framework, lack of sustainability \ndue  to  inadequate  funding  and  overloading,  and  lack  of  private  sector  participation.  The \ngovernment is addressing these sector issues with the assistance of development partners, \nincluding ADB, the World Bank, and JICA, and has (i) promulgated laws for developing and \noperating transport infrastructure, (ii) commenced a program to control overloading, and (iii) \ninitiated outsourcing of road maintenance to the private sector. This momentum needs to be \nmaintained and these government achievements need to be further enhanced to achieve the \ngoal of delivering better road services to road users in Cambodia and the GMS. \n \n5.  To  address  the  lack  of  regulatory  framework  in  the  road  sector,  the  government \npromulgated the Law on Road in April 2014, with the objective of developing and managing \nroad infrastructure to provide safe road transportation in Cambodia. Under the Law on Road, \nthe MPWT was designated to manage future expressways (none currently exists) and national \nand provincial roads through (i) developing policies, strategies, plans, and technical documents; \n(ii) encouraging private sector participation in road works; (iii) introducing new technologies and \napproaches  in  road  development  and  maintenance;  (iv)  protecting  roads  from  vehicle \n                                                \n1  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Public Works and Transport. 2014. Law on Road. Phnom Penh (Chapters 4, \n6, 8, and 9). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2018s website on 8 November 2016. \n ", "2  \noverloading,  and  (v)  developing  human  resources.  The  preparation  of  the  required  law \nimplementation procedures, which are yet to be developed, is now a priority for the MPWT. \n \n6.  The  substantial  investment  in  rehabilitating  future  expressways  and  national  and \nprovincial roads may diminish in value as roads deteriorate because of traffic, flooding, and \noverloading unless adequate road maintenance is provided in a timely manner and vehicle \noverloading  is  better  controlled.  Adequate road maintenance  involves  optimal maintenance \nplanning, budgeting, and execution. ADB assisted the MPWT in introducing a road maintenance \nmanagement system\u2014an objective maintenance planning and prioritization tool and preparing a \n3-year rolling maintenance plan and budget.3 Further, the MPWT needs to understand the \nlonger-term road sector financing needs and explore road financing options, including those \nbased on the user-pays principle, by researching good practices in the GMS and elsewhere.  \n \n7.  The MPWT also needs to improve road maintenance execution to be able to better \nutilize available funds. Currently, the MPWT delivers road maintenance using force account \nwhere  quality  and  transparency  is  an  issue.  Only  10%  of  maintenance  works  are  being \noutsourced. The ADB-financed Road Asset Management Project4 made the first intervention to \naddress the issue through a gradual outsourcing process and prepared three action plans on \nprivate  sector  development,  organizational  change,  and  force  account  reforms;  organized \ntraining for private contractors; and gained some acceptance of engaging the private sector in \nroad maintenance.5 However, the objective to commence outsourcing of maintenance works \nwas not achieved due to legal and capacity constraints, and the action plans have yet to be \noperationalized by the MPWT due to resource constraints. \n \n8.  While the MPWT has been addressing the road maintenance issue, Cambodia\u2019s roads \nare still being damaged by overloaded trucks, leading to the need for premature repair works. \nThe MPWT established 27 weigh stations and formed the national axle overloading control \ncommittee (NAOCC) to oversee all activities in axle load control.6 Further assistance is needed \nfor the MPWT to develop a strategic framework to control overloading by reassessing the \noperation and process being used for controlling vehicle overloading and finding alternative \ntechnologies, solutions, and approaches to systematically achieve the objective of reducing \nroad damage from overloaded trucks. The MPWT, in May 2016, showed strong commitment to \nimprove  controlling  axle  loads,  and  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  support  in  exploring  the  latest \ntechnology and cost-effective approaches that are implementable in Cambodia to control axle \nloads. \n \n9.  The  TA  will  assist  the  MPWT  in  addressing  the  incomplete  legal  and  regulatory \nframework, lack of sustainability of the road asset, and lack of private sector participation by (i) \npreparing required institutional, regulatory, policy, and strategic frameworks; and (ii) providing \nstart-up support in adopting and refining a business process for effectively managing the road \nassets.  The  objective  of  the  TA  aligns  with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018 \npriorities to reduce poverty and vulnerability in Cambodia by assisting government agencies in \nthe implementation of sector reforms, building institutional capacity, catalyzing resource flows, \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2002.

It is expected that the strategies to be developed under \nthe TA will help the MPWT more systematically engage sector stakeholders for long-term \ncollaboration to deliver a sustainable road network to GMS and domestic road users. The TA \nwill  supplement  the  planned  assistance  under  the  Road  Network  Improvement  Project  in \nresolving the technical and operational issues of the weigh stations to control axle loads.8 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be transport infrastructure contributing to the enhancement of national \ncompetitiveness and people\u2019s welfare developed. The outcome will be MPWT\u2019s capacity in \ndelivering road services strengthened. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will (i) review the Law on Road and existing law implementation procedures for \nidentifying  gaps  and  improvements;  (ii)  study  the  public  expenditure  review  and  revenue \nmobilization strategy prepared by the World Bank and the road sector revenue generation \nmethods prepared by ADB (footnote 3) to understand how road sector revenue has evolved; (iii) \nevaluate the action plans prepared for delivering road services (para. 7) in relation to assessing \nrelevance,  implementation  progress,  and  needed  improvements;  and  (iv)  assess  the \norganizational and human capacity of the MPWT focusing on the General Department of Public \nWorks (GDPW), which is responsible for road maintenance and administration, the General \nDepartment  of  Administration  (GDA),  which  handles  the  MPWT\u2019s  administrative  matters \n(including human resource development), and the NAOCC, which oversees the overloading \ncontrol program in Cambodia. Based on the results of these review, study, evaluation, and \nassessments as well as findings from discussions and consultations with sector stakeholders, \nthe TA aims to deliver the following three outputs. \n \n12.  Output 1: Institutional and regulatory frameworks strengthened. The TA will (i) draft \nrequired procedures, regulations, and guidelines for implementing the Law on Road; (ii) prepare \na  time-bound  action  plan  for  approving  such  procedures,  regulations,  and  guidelines;  (iii) \ndetermine road sector financing needs up to 2025 and prepare a policy note on road sector \nfinancing options from 2025 onward; (iv) optimize the organizational structure of the GDPW, \nGDA, and NAOCC; and (v) update the human resource development plan of the MPWT through \nGDA, including strengthening institutional capacity for gender mainstreaming both through the \nGender Mainstreaming Action Group of the MPWT and other divisions of the MPWT. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Strategic  framework  for  engaging  the  private  sector  in  road \nmaintenance established. The TA will (i) develop a strategy for engaging the private sector in \nroad maintenance that directs the MPWT to further outsource road maintenance works in a \nsystematic way, (ii) prepare a road map for implementing the strategy with clear indicators and \ntargets  to  monitor  the  change  and  performance,  (iii)  recommend  ways  to  strengthen  the \nGDPW\u2019s and GDA\u2019s business processes for effectively outsourcing force account works, and (iv) \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Cambodia, 2014\u20132018. Manila. \n8  The Road Network Improvement Project is programmed for 2017 approval. \n ", "4  \nstrengthen technical documents such as the standard bidding documents for road maintenance \nand the manual for maintenance supervision. \n \n14.  Output 3: Axle overload control operations strengthened. The TA will (i) develop a \nstrategy to combat vehicle overloading that will direct the MPWT in introducing implementable \nand  stepwise  approaches  and  cost-effective  technologies  to  achieve  reduced  vehicle \noverloading, (ii) prepare a road map for implementing the strategy with clear indicators and \ntargets to monitor the change and performance, (iii) recommend ways to strengthen the NAOCC \nsecretariat\u2019s business process for effectively implementing the strategy and road map, and (iv) \nstrengthen the internal calibration procedure of weigh scales for controlling vehicle axle loads. \n \n15.  To  deliver  these  outputs,  the  MPWT  will  assign three focal  persons (one from  the \nNAOCC secretariat for controlling vehicle overloading; one from the GDPW for outsourcing of \nforce account works; and one from GDA for updating the human resource development plan) to \nclosely  work  with  consultants.  In  addition,  the  MEF  will  assign  another  two  focal  persons \nrepresenting  the  General  Department  of  International  Cooperation  and  Debt  Management \n(GDICDM)  and  the  General  Department  of  Budget  (GDB)  to  assist  the  TA  consultants  in \npreparing a policy note for road maintenance financing options. \n \n16.  Since the TA will address broader road sector development issues, the TA will follow a \nparticipatory approach. The consultants will engage stakeholders in the process of preparing the \ninstitutional, regulatory, and strategic frameworks through (i) organizing brainstorming sessions \nand debates with target groups to reach consensus on the newly drafted law implementation \nprocedures,  road  maintenance  financing  options,  strengthened  business  process,  and \norganizational changes; and (ii) conducting a workshop and seminars for targeted groups to \nobtain feedback on the technical documents and knowledge products to be produced under the \nTA. \n \n17.  The TA risks are (i) turnover of the trained MPWT staff may lead to loss of momentum; \nand (ii) change in focal persons in MPWT and MEF may delay the implementation of TA \nactivities. ADB will closely monitor possible changes through the national coordinator and agree \nwith the government on timely replacements, if needed. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,550,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in the form  of  staff,  offices,  permissions, logistical  assistance, \naccess to information and reports, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The executing agency of the TA will be the MPWT. The MPWT will coordinate closely \nwith the MEF, NAOCC, and Ministry of Rural Development, which manages rural roads in \nCambodia  on  the  TA  implementation.  The  Transport  and  Communications  Division  of  the \nSoutheast Asia Department of ADB will be responsible for the TA administration. The TA is \nexpected to be implemented from 15 May 2017 to 15 May 2019. \n \n20.  ADB will recruit a firm based on the quality- and cost-based selection method using a \n90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio with full technical proposal in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). It is anticipated that a firm will be \n ", "  5\nrequired to provide 29 person-months of international consultancy services and 40 person-\nmonths of national consultancy services to deliver all three TA outputs. Output-based contracts \nwill be considered to improve economy and efficiency. \n \n21.  In addition to a firm, a national coordinator and an international weigh station expert will \nbe recruited separately using the individual selection method. An international weigh station \nexpert (5 person-months) will help (i) the MPWT in resolving technical issues of the weigh \nstations; and (ii) the firm in preparing a strategy to combat vehicle overloading in regard with \nadopting cost-effective technologies for controlling vehicle axle loads. A national coordinator (20 \nperson-months) will (i) liaise with consultants, the NAOCC secretariat, the GDPW and GDA \nwithin the MPWT, the GDICDM and the GDB within the MEF, and other government agencies; \n(ii) oversee overall day-to-day TA implementation and immediately report any emerging TA \nimplementation  issues  to  ADB  and  the  MPWT;  (iii)  encourage  the  full  participation  of \nstakeholders in a series of consultation meetings; and (iv) support the international weigh \nstation expert in performing his or her tasks. \n \n22.  The TA outcome and outputs are expected to be shared with (i) development partners of \nCambodia through the Infrastructure Regional Integration Technical Working Group meeting \norganized by the MPWT; (ii) GMS neighbors through the Subregional Transport Forum; and (iii) \nleaders, experts, and transport stakeholders through the ADB Transport Forum.  \n \n23.  The  TA  will  procure  an  estimated  $18,000  worth  of  office  equipment  (two  desktop \ncomputers, a printer, and a photocopying machine) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  using  the  shopping  method.  The  office \nequipment  will  be  used  by  the  TA  consultants  and  turned  over  to  the  MPWT  upon  TA \ncompletion. \n \n24.  Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with the Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm will be responsible for \nmanaging provisional sums related to workshops, training, seminars, and conferences. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of Cambodia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Institutional Capacity Building in the Road Sector, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \n \nTransport infrastructure contributing to the enhancement of national competitiveness and people\u2019s welfare \ndeveloped (National Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018) \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020    Turnover of the trained \nMPWT\u2019s capacity in  The length of road  MPWT\u2019s annual report  MPWT staff may lead to \ndelivering road  maintained increased by    loss of momentum. \nservices  10% (2015 baseline: 6,910     \nstrengthened   km) \nOutputs  By 2019     \n1.
