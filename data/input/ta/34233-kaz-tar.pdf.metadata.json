INTRODUCTION\n1.  During the Country Programming  Mission  in April  2000,  the Government  requested  the\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  an  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  to\nstrengthen  its capacity  to formulate  and implement  sound public  investment  programs  (PIPs).1 A\nT A  Fact-Finding  Mission  from  ADB's  Kazakhstan  Resident  Mission  held  discussions  with\nofficials  of the Ministry  of Economy  (MOE)  and other concerned  Government  agencies  from  23\nJuly to 7 August  2000, and reached  an understanding  on the objectives,  scope,  costs, financing,\nand implementation  arrangements  for the proposed  T A.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  Kazakhstan experienced economic difficulties after it attained independence in 1991.\nThe economy recovered moderately during 1996-1997, but fell into a recession in 1998 because\nof  the  Russian  economic  crisis  and  the  fall  in  world  commodity  prices.  Under  such\ncircumstances, a new Government was formed in October 1999 to improve macroeconomic\nmanagement  and  stimulate  economic  recovery.  Recognizing the  importance  of  developing\ncredible  PIPs  for  macroeconomic  stabilization  and  sustained  economic  growth,  the  new\nGovernment has made efforts to strengthen the capacity to formulate and implement PIPs. First,\nMOE was established and the Department for Investment Policy (DIP) under MOE was made\nresponsible for formulating and implementing the PIPs in coordination with other ministries and\nlocal governments.  Second, a  number of  regulations relating to  PIP were  adopted.  These\ninclude Rules on Development and Implementation of the Public Investment Program, Rules on\nEconomic Analysis of Investment Projects Proposed for the Public Investment Program, Rules\non  Monitoring  Implementation  of  the  Public  Investment  Program,  and  Rules  on  Project\nEvaluation. Third,  initial steps were taken to link PIP formulation to the  State budget. The\nGovernment  has  developed  a  PIP  for  2000-2002  based  on  the  projected  budgetary\nperformance.\n3.  Despite  these  efforts,  the  Government  realizes  that  because  it  lacks  sufficient\nexperience, it needs external assistance to further enhance its capacity for public investment\nprogramming. Four major areas need to be strengthened. First, there is a need to develop a\ncoherent planning systems framework that both formalizes the coordinating links among the\nState budget, PIP, and the aid coordination process, and incorporates local investment projects\ninto PIP. Because it lacks this planning systems framework, the Government currently prepares\na PIP on the basis of short-term needs rather than a long-term development strategy. Moreover,\nthe PIP neither includes local investment projects nor identifies specific projects for external\nassistance. Second, the process and procedures for PIP formulation and implementation need\nto be improved. Although a number of regulatory procedures on PIP have been established,\nthey  are  not  satisfactory  because they  were  prepared in  a  very  short  period.  Third,  the\norganizational structure of DIP needs to be assessed. Given the fact that MOE was established\nunder  pressing conditions  and  to  meet an  immediate need of the  new  Government,  it  is\nimperative to carefully assess the functional responsibilities and resources of DIP with the aim\nof creating an efficient organizational structure for PIP formulation. Fourth, government officials\nneed training to develop adequate skills in preparing and implementing sound PIPs.\n4.  Strong Government capacities are a prerequisite to develop credible PIPs. A sound PIP\nis essential for the Government to fon'nulate an appropriate external borrowing strategy, elicit\nfinancial support from the external aid community, attract foreign capital, and spur domestic\nThe TA first appearedi n ADB Business in June", "2\nprivate  investment.  The  generated  income  and  employment  opportunities  will  contribute  to\npoverty  reduction  and the long-term  social and economic  development  in Kazakhstan.  The T A is\ndesigned  to help build the necessary  Government  capacity  to formulate  and  implement  PIPs by .\naddressing  the four priority  requirements  identified  in para. 3.\n5.  ADB  has  provided  similar  assistance  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Uzbekistan.2  While\nsome  of the  T A projects  remain  ongoing,  some  lessons  drawn  from  implementing  them  show\nthat  (i)  ADB  support  for  public  investment  programming  has  strengthened  its  development\npartnership  with  the  concerned  governments,  (ii) government  commitment  is key to successful\n,\nproject  implementation,  and (iii) because  of both resource  and time constraints  under  the single\nT A project,  the impact  of assistance  for capacity  building can be maximized  if it is extended  in a\n.\nphased  manner.\n6.  An ADB  Special  Evaluation  Study  in December  1999 assessed  past  advisory  technical\nassistance  in  Kazakhstan  and  identified  the  following  major  lessons:  (i)  TAs  designed  for\ntraining  should  be preceded  by a thorough  training  needs  assessment,  (ii)  T A design  should\nhave  the active  participation  of the Government  so as to build a better sense  of ownership  and\ncommitment,  (iii) T A design  should  provide  sufficient  resources  for interpretation  and translation\nservices,  and  (iv)  training  under  T As  should  encompass  as  many  government  officials  as\npossible  to mitigate  the effects  of staff  attrition  through  retrenchment  or other  reasons.  These\nrecommendations  will  be followed  in formulating  and  implementing  the  subject  T A to  ensure\nachievement  of its objective.\n7.  The Government  has so far received  limited external  assistance  for capacity  building  for\nPIP. The World  Bank helped  develop  a PIP database  through  the services  of a consultant  under\na TA loan from  September  1999 to August  2000.  However,  the assistance  focused  on technical\nrather than institutional  issues. At the request  of the Government,  during July-August  2000, ADB\nprovided  a  short-tem1  staff  consultant  to  assist  in  finalizing  the  PIP  for  2000-2002.  The\nEuropean  Union  plans  to  provide  technical  assistance  through  staff  training  and  provision  of\nequipment.  The  subject  T A has  been  designed  and will  be implemented  in close  coordination\nwith the concerned  aid agencies  to reinforce  the development  impacts  of their  respective  efforts.\nAs  the  first  major  external  assistance  in this  area,  the  T A will  enable  ADB  to  take  the  lead\namong  aid agencies  in assisting  the Government  to develop  the capacity  for PIP.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n8.  The  T A  aims  is  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Government  to formulate  and\nimplement PIPs that are consistent with the country's development priorities and are closely\n.\nlinked to the State budget. The T A framework is given in Appendix 1.\n.\n'I: TA 3204-KGZ:S  trengtheningA id Coordinationa nd Managemen!f.o r $124,000.a pprovedo n 9 June 1999; TA\n3382-KGZ: StrengtheningC apacityI n the Ministry of Finance for FinancialM  anagementa nd Planning of the\nPublic Investment Program, for $463,500. approved on 28 December 1999; TA 2771-UZB: Improving Aid\nCoordinationa nd Managementf,o r $600.000.a pprovedo n 18 March 1997; and TA 3190-UZB:I mprovingA  id\nCoordinationa nd Managemen(t Phase/ I), for $800,000,a pprovedo n 4 May 1999.\n~", "3\nScope\nThe TA   will comprise four components.\n(i)  Developing an effective planning systems framework. This component will help\nestablish strong links among MOE, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), line ministries,\nand local governments in formulating and implementing PIPs. In addition, pilot\nPIPs will be conducted in one or two oblasts3 to strengthen investment planning\nand  implementation in the oblasts, and provide a  better linkage between the\ncentral agencies of the Government and local governments.\n(ii) Strengthening  PIP  process  and procedures.  This  component  will  introduce\nstandard procedures for preparing PIPs with emphasis on a consistent format\nand  specific guidelines for  project submission; improve  a  process for  project\nselection, evaluation, and prioritization; formalize links, procedures, and approval\nmechanisms among the indicative planning cycle, budget cycle, PIP cycle, and\naid  coordination;  refine  the  PIP  database;  and  develop  a  framework  for\nmonitoring and evaluating PIPs. A three-year rolling PIP and a PIP procedures\nmanual will be produced.\n(iii) Making  an  organizational  assessment  and  recommendations  for  DIP.  The\nfunctions  and responsibilities  of DIP as well as its staffing  and financial  resources\nfor the operations  will  be reviewed  to assess  appropriateness  and  effectiveness\nof  its  organizational  structure.  The  assessment  will  focus  on  formulation  and\nimplementation  of  PIP,  capital  investment  planning  and  budgeting,  and\ncoordination  and  management  of  external  assistance.  On  the  basis  of  the\nassessment,  recommendations  on  a  new  organizational  structure,  functional\nresponsibilities,  and required  resources  will be made.\n(iv) Training  government  officials.  Officials  of  MOE,  MOF,  line  ministries,  and\nselected  local governments  involved  in formulating  and implementing  PIPs will be\ntrained.  Subject  areas  will  include  public  investment  planning;  project  appraisal,\nevaluation,  and  prioritization;  financial  and  economic  analyses  of  projects;\nresource  planning  and  budgeting;  incorporation  of  social  and  environmental\nimpacts  of projects  into  PIP preparation;  monitoring  of PIP  implementation;  and\nregional  investment  planning.\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10.  The estimated cost of the TA is $720,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange\ncomponent  of  $434,000  and  a  local  currency  component  of  $286,000  equivalent.  The\nGovernment  has requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign\nexchange cost and $66,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by\nADB, on a grant basis, from the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan. The\nGovernment will finance $220,000 equivalent of the local currency cost in the form of office\naccommodation  and facilities,  remuneration of counterpart staff, local communications, and\nother  administrative  services. The detailed cost estimates and financing  plan are  given  in\nAppendix 2.\n= \n3 Oblast  province.", "4\n.\nD. ImplementationArrangements\n11.  The  T A  will  be  implemented  under  the  guidance and  coordination  of  the  steering .\ncommittee  that  comprises  members  of  MOE,  MOF,  line  ministries  and  selected  local\ngovernments.  MOE will be the Executing Agency under the TA  . MOE will appoint a project\ndirector, who will be responsible for overseeing implementation of the TA. MOE will provide all\nnecessary support to ADB's team of consultants: (i) reports, statistical data, and other relevant\ninformation available within the Government; (ii) sufficient office space, related furniture, and\nfacilities;  (iii) suitable counterpart staff; and (iv) administrative and logistical assistance. The\nGovernment is also committed to allowing concerned staff to fully participate in the training\nsessions under the TA  . ADB will review and monitor the implementation of the TA   through\n.\nregular missions and consultant's reports.\n12.  The TA   will be implemented through the services of a team of international consultants\nfor a total of 14 person-months. Four international experts (person-months are in parentheses)\nwill be required: a public investment program adviser/team leader (7.5), an economist (2), an\ninstitutional development adviser (2), and a computer systems specialist (2.5). Outline terms of\nreference  for  international  consultants  are  in Appendix 3.  International consultants  will  be\nsupported by domestic consultants (8 person-months) with experience in PIP and development\neconomics. Detailed terms of reference for the domestic consultants will be determined by the\ninternational consultants in consultation with ADS and the Government. The consultants will be\nselected and recruited in accordance with ADS's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and in\naccordance with other arrangements satisfactory to ADS for engaging domestic consultants.\nThe  consultants  will  procure  equipment  (photocopiers, fax  machines,  modems,  computer\nhardware and software. uninterruptible power supplies. and printers) in accordance with ADS's\nGuidelines for Procurement. A simplified technical proposal format will be used for selecting the\ninternational  consultants.  The  TA    is  expected  to  commence  in  January  2001  and  to  be\ncompleted in December 2001.\n13.  Implementation  of  the  proposed  TA    will  be  closely  coordinated  with  that  of  the\nforthcoming ADB-funded TA   for assisting the Govemment to prepare a medium-term poverty\nreduction  strategy.  The  latter  project  will  include a  component  for  enhancing  the  poverty\nreduction impact of the Government's development programs and public investment projects.\nIV.
