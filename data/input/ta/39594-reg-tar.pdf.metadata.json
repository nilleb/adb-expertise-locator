Since 1992, the six member countries1 of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) have \nembarked on a program of economic cooperation (the GMS Program) that aims to promote \ndevelopment through closer economic linkages. Cooperation in the energy sector in the GMS \nhas focused on the building of physical and institutional infrastructure for regional power trading \nin the context of the GMS Flagship Program for promoting regional power trading.  \n2.  The Inter-Governmental Agreement on Regional Power Trade in the GMS (IGA) was \nsigned during the first GMS Summit of Leaders in 2002 and a Memorandum of Understanding \non the Guidelines for the Implementation of the Regional Power Trade Agreement \u2013 Stage #1 \nwas signed during the second GMS Summit of Leaders in 2005. The Regional Power Trade \nCoordination Committee (RPTCC) comprising representatives of senior government officials \nfrom six GMS countries, Asian Development Bank (ADB), and other development partners was \ncreated in 2002, and tasked with coordinating, promoting, and implementing regional power \ntrading development. The RPTCC Work Plan (2005\u20132008) was developed and endorsed by all \nRPTCC members during the third RPTCC meeting in April 2005. The updated RPTCC Work \nPlan (2005\u20132008) is shown in Appendix 1. \n3.  The physical infrastructure projects for cross-border power trading are ongoing, with the \nparticipation  of  the  private  sector  and  other  development  partners.  The  GMS  countries \nrecognized that it would be essential to optimize RPTCC activities and implement the prioritized \nwork in a timely manner, and requested support from ADB and other development partners. The \nproposed technical assistance (TA)2 project responded to this request. The TA project was \ndiscussed at the fourth RPTCC Meeting held at Yangon, Myanmar, in September 2005, and all \nsix GMS countries concurred with ADB to pursue the TA. Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD) supports the initiatives of GMS regional power trading development will provide financing \nsupport  of  Euro  (\u20ac)  1,000,000  for  the  implementation  of  this  project.  The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 2. \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The six GMS member countries are characterized by uneven electricity demand along \nwith mismatched availability of resources for economic power production. Power trading in the \nGMS therefore presents excellent opportunities to promote the efficient use of energy resources. \nRegional power trading will stimulate investments and economic cooperation in the subregion. \nThe  GMS  country  governments  have  a  strong  commitment  to  and sense  of  ownership  of \nrelevant policies and strategies for developing a regional power trade market. \n5.  The GMS Summit declaration issued by GMS leaders in November 2002 enunciated a \nvision of freeing their people from poverty and providing sustainable development opportunities \nfor all their citizens. The GMS needs to be increasingly integrated to attain these goals and to \ncompete in a globalized world. A key objective of GMS cooperation is thus the development of \nGMS markets and movement of goods and people across common borders. This objective is to \nbe achieved through the implementation of the GMS vision for enhanced connectivity, increased \ncompetitiveness, and a greater sense of community. Greater connectivity will help to physically \nintegrate the region through a network of transport, power, and telecommunications facilities. \nPhysical connectivity will help improve the region\u2019s competitiveness through greater access to \nmarkets. \n                                                 \n1  Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 29 September 2005. ", "2 \n6.  ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (RCSP) 2004\u20132008 supports pro-poor, \nsustainable growth through four thrusts: (i) strengthening connectivity and facilitating cross-\nborder movements, (ii) integrating national markets to promote economic efficiency and private-\nsector development, (iii) addressing capacity building associated with subregional linkages, and \n(iv) managing the environment and shared natural resources. RCSP 2004\u20132008 has identified \nthe importance of expanding cooperation in energy trading and regional cooperation through \njoint development of energy sources in the region and has included this TA in the Program. \n7.  Under the GMS framework and programs, a number of priority projects, especially the \nprovision of regional power sector infrastructure, have been successfully implemented or are \nbeing implemented through financial and technical assistance provided by the governments of \nGMS countries, ADB, and other development partners. ADB has provided three investment \nloans and 11 TAs with a total amount of $487 million to promote regional cooperation in the \nenergy sector. Among them is TA 5920-REG,3 the GMS Regional Indicative Master Plan on \nPower Interconnection, which provided the framework for cross-border power interconnection \nprojects to be implemented during 2004\u20132020. \n8.  The initiative of regional power trade involves building both the institutional and physical \ninfrastructure frameworks that will create conditions for an integrated power system. All GMS \nmember countries recognize that regional power trade will be developed in phases and a \nregional  power  market  will  evolve  gradually  through  institutional  change  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment. \n9.  GMS member countries also recognize that it is necessary to have adequate institutional \narrangements, work programs, and resources to carry out all actions needed to achieve the \nregional power market. In this context, all GMS countries have formulated and adopted the \nRPTCC work plan, which identified key prioritized tasks that are brought together in this TA. The \ncomponents are considered coherent and necessary for implementing the Regional Power \nTrade Operating Agreement (RPTOA) in the initial stages. The TA emphasizes the essential \nlinkages between them and facilitates the development of a GMS regional power market using a \nconsolidated and integrated approach. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nA.  Impact and Output \n10.  The development of a competitive and efficient subregional power trade market will be \nthe final long-term target. Heading to this, and there is need for a progressive evolution from the \ncurrent independent country systems with very limited power trade to a liquid and competitive \nsubregional market. The findings of TA 6100-REG4 indicate that this evolution should have four \nwell-defined stages, with targets that must be achieved at each stage before advancing to the \nnext one. The targets in stage 1 are to allow contracted power trade between two neighboring \ncountries. During stage 2 such transactions may extend to all the GMS countries. \n11.  The TA will focus on developing institutions and building capacity that will lead to the \ncreation of an efficient and competitive GMS power market. The TA will (i) develop a holistic and \nintegrated action plan on regional power trade development; (ii) create adequate institutions to \nundertake the tasks associated with the implementation of regional power trade in the initial \nstages;  (iii)  assist  GMS  member  countries  in  capacity  building  and  human  resource \ndevelopment relating to regional power trade and cooperation; and (iv) develop a platform or \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2000.

The TA outputs will help GMS countries strengthen \ntheir capacity to promote regional power trade development. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Given the complex and long-term nature of the development of a GMS power market, \nthe  TA  will  be  comprehensive  but  will  focus  on  the  four  prioritized  components.  These \ncomponents will complement each other to facilitate and promote the development of the GMS \npower market. \n13.  Component  1:  Develop  a  Systematic  and  Integrated  Action  Plan  on  Regional \nPower Trade Development.  A team comprising consultants and government officials from \nGMS  countries  will  review  and  update  progress  on  regional  power  sector  development, \ndiagnose the main issues in regional power trade, and assess the appropriate approach to \ndeveloping the energy resource in the GMS. Key activities are (i) review and collate information \navailable  in  past  studies,  including  the  Regional  Indicative  Master  Plan  on  Power \nInterconnection in the GMS, Study on Regional Power Trade Operating Agreement, and the \nupdated power development plans of the six GMS countries; (ii) analyze the macroeconomic \nand energy development prospects in the GMS, and provide macro development strategies on \nregional  power  trading,  including  both  physical  infrastructure  investments  and  institutional \ndevelopment; (iii) assess the current institutional capacity in the power sectors of the GMS \ncountries,  diagnose  the  factors  impeding  regional  power  trade  development,  and  provide \nrecommendations and strategies; (iv) update and optimize the regional master plan on cross-\nborder interconnection projects; and (v) synthesize collected information into a systematic and \nintegrated  action  plan  on  regional  power  trade  development  with  concrete  and  prioritized \nphysical and institutional infrastructure projects to be implemented in a reasonable time frame. \n14.  Component  2:  Facilitate  Creation  of  Institutions  to  Coordinate  and  Develop \nRegional  Power  Trade. Component 2 will facilitate the creation of the necessary regional \ninstitutions in GMS member countries to coordinate initial activities and eventually perform day-\nto-day regional power trade operations. \n15.  The GMS countries agreed to create a focal group (FG) and a planning working group \n(PWG), to be established in 2006. A technical secretariat and a regional regulatory board will be \ncreated later as necessary, depending on the development of the regional power market. \n16.  At the initial development stage, the FG will coordinate the implementation activities of \npromoting regional power development in the GMS. The main functions and activities of FG will \ninclude developing internal procedures to guide the FG\u2019s initial operation and management, and \nupdating short- and medium-term action plans for FG operation. The PWG will be a specialized \ngroup to be set up by RPTCC to coordinate the planning of GMS cross-border transmission \nlines. The PWG will initially have the functions of both operational planning and system planning. \n17.  Key  activities  under  this  component  will  be  to  (i)  design  and  develop  the  detailed \nstructure,  functions,  and  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  of  the  FG;  (ii)  assess  the  resource \nrequirements for FG establishment including legal, financial, and human resources, and outline \nthe steps and action plan for its establishment; (iii) develop internal procedures to guide FG\u2019s \ninitial operation and management; (iv) develop and update short- medium-term action plans for \nFG operations; (v) design and develop the detailed structure, functions and TOR of the PWG; \naTnhde  v(iveiw) sd eexvperelosps epd ehreforermin aanrec eth osstea nodf athred sc ornesgualtradnitn agn ds adfoe tnyo,t  nseecceusrsitayr,i lyr ereliaprbeislietyn t athnods eq oufa AlitDyB \u2019osf  \nsmeermvicbeer. s , Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n18.  Component 3: Build Capacity and Develop Human Resources. Component 3 will \nprovide training and workshops, and mobilize advisers in the field as necessary, for regional \n ", "4 \npower trade operations and management for GMS countries. It will also support the countries in \npreparing an overall framework and action plans to strengthen capacity building and develop \nhuman resources for regional power sector cooperation.  \n19.  Key activities under this component will be: (i) assess the institutional capacity of the \nGMS  member  countries  and  develop  detailed  medium-term  (2006\u20132010)  capacity-building \nplans for each country to support the implementation of the Regional Power Trade Agreement; \n(ii) conduct general training and workshops for national officials and technical staff on regional \npower trade, including planning, operation agreement, transaction and dispatch, best practices \nfor regional power trade, regulatory pricing, etc. (iii) for officials and state attorneys in legal \nministries, conduct training and workshops on laws and regulations relating to the legal issues \nof  cross-border  power  trading;  (iv)  review  and  provide  recommendations  on  key  policy \ninterventions and institutional reforms at national and regional levels to remove barriers to \nincreased energy cooperation and trading; and (v) formulate action plans on human resource \ndevelopment in GMS countries, and develop and carry out training programs for operation and \nmanagement staff to be engaged in the initial stages, particularly the regional regulatory board, \nregional transaction coordinators, operation and system PWGs, etc. \n20.  Component 4: Establish a Platform or Database for Information Exchange and \nCommunication.  To  develop  a  competitive  and  interconnected  regional  power  market, \ninformation on GMS countries\u2019 power facilities will be essential and must be made available by \nall parties. Component 4 will assist GMS countries in promoting the establishment of a platform \nor database for information exchange and communication among the countries to facilitate \nregional power trade. \n21.  Key activities of this component will be: (i) design and develop the information and \ncommunication technology strategy applicable to regional power trading for the countries; (ii) \nassess  the  requirements  for  hardware  infrastructure,  software  availability,  information \ntechnology, and human resources; (iii) conduct an analysis of the GMS energy sector, collect \nadequate basic data and information, and design and develop an appropriate database; (iv) \ndevelop a website on regional power trading development; and (v) for relevant staff of GMS \ncountries, conduct training and workshops on web page application and maintenance. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,300,000 equivalent comprising \u20ac1,000,000 \n(equivalent  to  about  $1,200,000)  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  AFD  and  $100,000 \nequivalent in kind, to be contributed by the participating six GMS member countries through \nprovision of office facilities, information and reports, etc. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The TA is being undertaken as a priority activity of the GMS RPTCC Work Plan (2006\u2013\n2008).  The  GMS  RPTCC  will  take  responsibility  for  overall  coordination,  oversight,  and \nfacilitation of TA implementation. Coordination with other development partners involved in \npromoting regional power trade and cooperation will be pursued to avoid duplication of effort.  \n24.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Infrastructure Division (MKID) of \nMekong  Regional  Department  (MKRD)  will  take  the  lead  in  implementing  the  TA,  in  full \ncollaboration and consultation with other departments involved in GMS program activities, AFD, \nand  the  GMS  countries.  MKID  will  be  supported  by  a  consultant  energy  specialist  with \nexperience in subregional power trading and cooperation, acting as focal point for and overall \nadviser to the TA to ensure quality outputs and outcomes, and to guide the TA consultants. The ", "5 \nenergy specialist will be engaged as an individual consultant for 6 person-months of intermittent \nservice, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n25.  A small TA secretariat will be established within MKID, under the overall direction of the \nassigned  Task  Manager,  to  ensure  smooth  coordination  between  and  among  the  GMS \ncountries, consultants, and ADB, and will help produce reports and disseminate them on time. \nThe secretariat, which will include the consultant energy specialist referred to above, will closely \ncoordinate with the GMS countries, each of which will establish a focal point and a counterpart \nagency to liaise directly with the TA consultants and the secretariat.  \n26.  The RPTCC members from six GMS countries will be the counterpart agencies for TA \nimplementation. Each counterpart agency will provide relevant national data and information, \nfacilitate consultation with national stakeholders, and provide adequate supporting services \nincluding office facilities for in-country activities to efficiently execute the consulting services. \n27.  The TA itself will be implemented by an international consulting firm. ADB will select and \nengage consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The quality- \nand  cost-based  procedure  will  be  used.  To  expedite  project  implementation,  advance \nrecruitment of consultants will be required. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n28.  The TA will be implemented in two phases, with an overall period of approximately 24 \nmonths, from January 2006 to December 2007. The first two components will be implemented in \nphase 1, while the remaining two components will be done in phase 2. It is estimated that the \nTA will require 34 person-months of international consulting inputs and 32 person-months of \ndomestic consulting inputs. The experts will have expertise in cross-border power trading and \ndevelopment, including power system planning, institutional development, capacity building, and \ninformation system development. The international firm of consultants will engage domestic \nconsultants  as  sub-consultants.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  to  which  the  international \nconsulting firm will implement the TA are in Appendix 4. \n29.  The consultants will prepare inception, interim, draft final, and final reports for each \ncomponent. The TA outputs will be disseminated by a variety of means (website, in-country \nworkshops, electronic reports, and brochures). \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n30.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  \u20ac1,000,000  (equivalent  to  $1,200,000)  to  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement for the Greater Mekong \nSubregion Power Trade Coordination and Development Project. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nGMS\u2500REGIONAL POWER TRADE COORDINATION COMMITTEE \nUpdated Work Plan (2005\u20132008)a \n \nSource of  Implementing \nOutputs  Time Frame\nFunds  Agencies \nA.
