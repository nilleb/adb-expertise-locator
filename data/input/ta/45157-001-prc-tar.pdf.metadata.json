INTRODUCTION \n1.  The policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) project for Strengthening Institutional \nReform and Capacity Building was included in the TA pipeline for the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) during the December 2010 Country Programming Mission, responding to the \ngovernment\u2019s request for a new \u2015facility-type\u2016 TA for 2011\u20132013. Beginning in 2004, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has granted several facility-type TA projects to provide flexible and \ntimely knowledge products and services to the government to respond effectively to emerging \npolicies and capacity development needs.1 The facility TA is the fifth of a series whose success \nhas proven the effectiveness of the facility modality.2 The implementation period of the TA will \ncoincide with the first three years of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, which will allow \nADB to provide timely support for the PRC\u2019s reform process and help address development \nconstraints. Agreement was reached with the executing agency, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), \non impact, outcome, scope, and implementation arrangements. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.      ISSUES \n2.  Despite the PRC's considerable progress regarding overall economic growth, critical \ngaps and imbalances remain, including between economic and social development, rural and \nurban areas, and western and coastal regions. The key development issues to be dealt with \ninclude (i) low productivity growth, particularly in rural areas and remote regions; (ii) inadequate \nprovision of social services and social protection, particularly in rural areas; and (iii) weak \ninstitutions and capacity, as well as knowledge gaps that constrain some government agencies' \nability to live up to their responsibilities.  \n \n3.  Development constraints, and the need to formulate and execute policies to rectify them, \nhave been acknowledged in the latest five-year plan. Endorsed on 14 March 2011 by the \n11th National People\u2019s Congress, the plan rolls out the key policy directions for further reform \nand development in the next 5 years. The main objectives and policy guidelines are clustered in \nthree broad areas of reform: economic restructuring, better living standards, and environmental \nprotection. Critical among the plan\u2019s objectives is changing the growth pattern from the past \nemphasis on industrial production, capital investment, and exports to a model more oriented \ntoward  services  and  consumption,  which  is  necessary  to  overcome  the  PRC\u2019s  social, \nenvironmental, and external imbalances. The plan also gives high priority to the improvement of \npeople's livelihoods by targeting a more equitable income distribution and expanding social \nsecurity coverage and benefits. In addition, the environmental agenda features prominently in \nthe plan, aiming to set the fundamentals for a low-carbon economy. \n \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2004.

Technical \nAssistance to the People's Republic of China for the Facility for Policy Reform and Capacity Building III (TA 7313-\nPRC, ongoing).  \n2\n The first three facility-type TA projects were completed and rated as successful, and their outputs were used in \nformulating emerging policies and strengthening capacity development. Adopted policies and recommendations \ncontributed to the smooth implementation of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010. The PRC\u2019s capacity, both in \ncentral and local governments, in project design, implementation, and portfolio management was also enhanced. \n3 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 July 2011.  \n   ", "2   \n4.  Some of the key policy areas in need of attention are: (i) shifting the emphasis of public \nspending from investment to public services, (ii) continuing financial sector reform, (iii) ensuring \ngreater private sector participation in the economy, (iv) continuing fiscal reform to strengthen \nlocal government finances, (v) stepping up rural development, and (vi) improving social security \ncoverage. These reform needs are reflected to some degree in the plan, so the challenge lies in \nhow to implement them successfully\u2014a process in which policymaking efficiency and flexibility \nare crucial. \n \n5.  The strategic goal of ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2008\u20132010 for the \nPRC, 4 as well as the anticipated priorities of the CPS now under preparation, is to help the PRC \nbuild  a  harmonious  and  moderately  prosperous  society  through  inclusive  growth  and \nenvironmentally sustainable development. By focusing on key implementation issues under the \nframework  of  the  five-year  plan,  the  TA  will  reinforce  the  strategic  partnership  and \ncomprehensive cooperation that guides the PRC\u2019s overall development agenda, based on the \ngovernment\u2019s needs and ADB\u2019s strengths. Cooperation under the TA will contribute to achieving \nthe goals set in the government\u2019s development agenda and in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, 5 which \nshare the developmental targets of inclusive growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and \nregional integration.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  impact  of  the  TA  is  enhanced  economic  policy  formulation  to  support \nimplementation  of  the  Twelve  Five-Year  Plan  accomplished.  The  outcome  is  policy \nrecommendations under the TA adopted by government agencies.  \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The key outputs of the TA will be (i) at least seven bilingual studies (one for each policy-\nrelated subproject) assessing and providing concrete recommendations for priority policy issues; \n(ii) at least one dissemination workshop to present main TA results; (iii) bilingual activity reports \nfor  each  capacity  development  subproject  outlining  the  key  rationale,  gaps  narrowed,  and \noutcomes, and attaching a resource material kit to support replication of similar and/or follow-up \ncapacity development activities; and (iv) at least one bilingual policy brief distilling the key \nissues discussed under the capacity development component (e.g., gaps in policy, operational \nmechanisms, and implementation capacities) and presenting recommendations (e.g., proposed \nreforms  and/or  operational  mechanisms  to  support  more  effective  policy,  or  lessons  from \ncapacity development approaches and recommendations for future programs).  \n \n8.  The  TA  design  provides  a  flexible  framework,  such  as  allowing  selection  of  some \nsubprojects during TA implementation. This flexibility will enable MOF and ADB to respond to \nemerging development issues and supplement other ADB operations (nonlending and lending \nproducts) in a timely manner. ADB can respond to the government's emerging needs through \nfrequent consultation and the use of flexible mechanisms to govern proposal submission and \nconsideration.  \n \n                                                \n4\n ADB. 2008: The People\u2019s Republic of China: Country Partnership Strategy (2008-2010).

Subprojects  will  be  selected  jointly  by  the  government  and  ADB.  The  criteria  for \nprioritizing policy-related subprojects include that the subproject (i) supports priority government \npolicy reforms and is consistent with the CPS for 2008\u20132010, as well as the CPS that is under \npreparation; (ii) is related to implementation of the five-year plan, particularly in the areas that \n  \nconcern  key development constraints (para. 2, above); (iii) is considered an emerging, urgent, \nand high-priority issue where ADB has considerable potential to add value; and (iv) shows \nevidence of strong PRC ownership, such that a small amount of strategic ADB assistance will \nhelp advance or realize important reforms and/or leverage the outcome and impact of existing \nprojects. Priority will also be given to capacity development subprojects that support cooperation \nbetween the PRC and ADB in solving the key development constraints highlighted in para. 2. \n \n10.  Activities will be divided into two categories\u2014policy advice and capacity development\u2014\noverseen by MOF, in close consultation and coordination with the implementing agencies, ADB, \nand stakeholders. \n \n11.   Policy  advice.  The TA  subprojects  will  provide  the central  and  selected  provincial \ngovernment agencies with policy advice on priority development issues in different sectors and \nsubjects, including (i) implementation of the five-year plan; (ii) rural development; (iii) social \nsector  reform;  and  (iii)  other  priority  sectors  agreed  jointly  by  the  government  and  ADB. \nActivities will include research studies, policy dialogue, and stakeholder consultation through \nmeetings, workshops, and conferences. The indicative allotment for this output category is \n$400,000. Agreement has been reached on seven subprojects, with a total budget of $350,000, \nas outlined in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  Capacity  development.  The  TA  subprojects  will  strengthen  the  development  and \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  central  and  selected  provincial  government  agencies through \norganizational diagnostics, capacity assessments, training programs, workshops, conferences, \nand knowledge management interventions. The indicative allotment for this output category is \n$100,000 for the dissemination of ADB TA best practices in selected themes or sectors through \nannual conferences on experience sharing.  Specific projects under this component will be \ndecided in future joint consultations between MOF and ADB, as indicated in para. 13. \n \n13.  Additional subprojects beyond those already determined (Appendix 2) are expected to \nbe included under the TA throughout the implementation period, using the selection criteria \nspecified in para. 9. ADB and MOF will hold periodic meetings to update the list of subprojects \nand core outputs; after each meeting, the two parties will record agreements reached during the \nmeeting, attaching (i) an updated subproject list with detailed project designs and specific terms \nof reference for additional subprojects, and (ii) reports on implementation progress for all TA \nsubprojects. The country director of the People's Republic of China Resident Mission will review \nand endorse the agreements between ADB and MOF. \n \n14.   ADB  and  the  government  will  jointly  select  the  additional  subprojects,  with  each \ncomponent indicatively including a final subproject to produce a concise synthesis monograph in \nboth print and electronic format to systematically compile and support dissemination of key \nachievements, lessons, and policy implications. Subprojects will typically include conferences to \ndiscuss  and  build  consensus  on key  issues,  capacity  development  seminars,  and/or  other \nworkshops involving participants from government agencies, the private sector, nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and/or international agencies. These conferences and/or workshops, \nalong with distribution of key subproject outputs in hard copy and via the internet, will serve to \ndisseminate information and subproject findings. \n \n   ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $675,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$500,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nothers). The government will contribute $175,000 equivalent in-kind for office space, counterpart \nstaff, and miscellaneous services. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \nSubsequent subprojects will be subject to a maximum of $100,000 each, unless this ceiling is \nwaived by MOF and ADB; the latter may also agree to adjust subproject budgets where justified \nin special cases and acceptable to the implementing agency in question. \n \n16.  The cost estimates are based on engaging expert inputs equivalent to 5 person-months \nof international consultants and 35 person-months of national consultants (the outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 4). Detailed terms of reference for the individual consultants will be \nfurther developed in close consultation with MOF, the implementing agencies, sector experts \nfrom  ADB,  and  ADB  staff  from  the  Central  Operations  Services  Office.  TA  support  for \nworkshops may include costs related to the venue, equipment rental, translation, printing and \ncopying, food and nonalcoholic beverages, transportation, lodging, logistics and administrative \nsupport, and other agreed expenditures with prior written approval from ADB. Subprojects may \nalso fund surveys, field investigations, and the purchase of required resource materials, based \non cost estimates agreed by ADB. In line with standard ADB procedures, the TA will not support \nimplementing agencies' management fees, overhead, or related costs such as staff salaries and \nallowances, and the use of implementing agencies' resources (such as office accommodation), \nwhich will be provided as part of the counterpart contribution. \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented from 1 November 2011 to 30 April 2013. MOF will be the \nexecuting agency, with responsibility for oversight and coordination of subproject activities. To \nensure strong coordination, ADB and MOF will meet quarterly, or as needed, to review progress \nand discuss additional subproject candidates. \n \n18.  Throughout the 18-month implementation period, ADB and MOF will accept subproject \nproposals from government organizations, various institutions, NGOs, and, in special cases, a \nunit within ADB or MOF. Based on the TA design and selection criteria, ADB and MOF will \njointly agree on subprojects to be included in the TA, and on the implementing agencies. The \nresident  mission  will  hold  consultations  and  discussions  with  experts  in  ADB's  East  Asia \nDepartment and knowledge departments to assess the urgency of subproject proposals, and \ntheir complementary quality to ongoing and planned ADB operations in the PRC. For each \nagreed subproject, the implementing agency in question will be responsible for coordination and \nthe quality and timeliness of output delivery. It will determine one focal point to provide inputs \nthroughout the subproject, including (i) liaising with  ADB, MOF, and other key actors and \ndecision makers to support implementation and policy dialogue;; and (ii) based on discussions \nwith the experts, proposing to ADB and MOF any changes needed in a subproject's scope or \napproaches. \n \n19.  ADB staff will monitor, and in some cases directly contribute to, TA progress and outputs, \nand  will  conduct  policy  discussions  with  government  agencies.  The  resident  mission  will \nadminister the TA, with counterparts from ADB headquarters providing contributions to and/or \nmanagement of some subprojects, based on their technical strengths and the relevance to other \nADB programs. \n \n    ", "    5      \n20.   In dialogue with MOF and/or the implementing agencies, ADB will recruit consultants as \nindividual consultants, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, \nas amended from time to time). ADB will recruit national (35 person-months equivalent) and \ninternational (5 person-months equivalent) experts to provide inputs as formal consultants, \nshort-term resource persons, and task-specific experts. The terms of reference, including the \nduration and expected results, will be endorsed by ADB. Additional resource persons and \nexperts will carry out specific tasks (e.g., case-study papers, workshop presentations, review of \ndraft reports). All procurement under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). To speed up implementation, \nADB may establish an advance facility for MOF and the implementing agencies, as needed, \nand/or utilize direct payment (e.g., for workshop venues). \n \nIV.
