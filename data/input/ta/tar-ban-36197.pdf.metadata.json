Despite earlier efforts to resuscitate Bangladesh\u2019s ailing financial markets, the level of \ninvestment  mobilization  has  remained  low  and  the  market  has  remained  largely \nunderdeveloped. This situation is traceable  mainly to the low level of investor confidence \nassociated with poor market governance and the consequent negative perception of investors. \nIn a continued effort to strengthen and deepen the financial system for mobilizing resources for \nprivate sector-led economic growth, the Financial Markets Governance Program (FMGP) was \nincluded in the Country Strategy and Program Update of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as \na firm loan project  for 2004. An ADB Mission visited Dhaka in July 2003 to undertake fact-\nfinding for the technical assistance (TA) in preparation for the FMGP loan. Understanding was \nreached with the Government  of Bangladesh  on the objectives, scope, cost estimates and \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference of the proposed program \npreparatory TA.1 The summary initial poverty and social analysis of the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Capital  Market  Development  Program  (CMDP)2 made  significant  progress  in \nstrengthening regulations and  establishing the supervisory structure for the capital market, \ndeveloping the basic market infrastructure, and laying down the foundation for the legal and \ninstitutional  framework  to  support  capital  market  development.  The  future  growth  and \ndevelopment of the financial markets require that the continuing low level of investor confidence \nand  underlying  impediments  to  increased  investments  be  addressed.  Weak  governance \nimpedes  market  development  and  gives  rise  to  inefficiencies  in  financial  intermediation. \nSystemic issues in the domestic financial markets include weak enforcement, poor corporate \ngovernance, slow development of the market infrastructure, and low level of capacity of major \nmarket players. \n \n3.  The  general  observation  is  that  governance  structures  are  deficient,  and  market \nregulators have ineffective enforcement and weak implementation capacity. Regulations were \nintroduced under the CMDP, but recurring violations of  securities laws and regulations have \nbeen reported. The absence to this day of any convictions in cases filed in connection with the \n1996 stock market scams has reflected the lack of credibility and effectiveness of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission (SEC) as regulator. SEC has problems recruiting private sector \nprofessionals due to its low pay scales. Its dependence on the national budget and lack of \nfinancial independence constrain its ability to attract qualified professionals to its ranks. To \nimprove its credibility and profile, SEC must be seen as a competent authority with adequate \nautonomy and free from external interference, with clear mandate to carry out its tasks. \n \n4.  Public trust in the two stock exchanges, Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and Chittagong \nStock Exchange (CSE), is low. A large number of member firms of the exchanges have limited \ncapitalization, weak governance structures, and inefficient operations. The market is mooting \nthe merger of the two exchanges, with merely 323 companies listed, as more cost-effective than \nhaving separate exchanges\u2014it will remove duplication of efforts and allow optimum use of \nscarce trained human resources among the exchanges themselves, the brokers, and the \nregulator. Furthermore, separating ownership from membership in the stock exchanges through \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 22 April 2003. \n2  ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Capital Market Development Program. Manila (Loan 1580-BAN, approved on \n20 November 1997 for $80 million). The program completion report on the loan, circulated to the Board in August \n2003, recommended that gaps and weaknesses in governance be addressed in future ADB assistance. ", "2  \ndemutualization is being considered by a number of market participants as a more effective way \nof reducing potential conflicts of interest and improving governance of the exchanges. However, \npractical difficulties arising from vested interests of exchange members who desire to keep their \nseats or resist change in long-established modes of operation have to be addressed as well as \nthe potential conflict of regulation versus commercial interest in a demutualized environment. \n \n5.  The state-owned Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB) remains the single largest \nintegrated capital market operator. While ICB has transferred its brokerage license to its stock \nbrokerage subsidiary, it continues to operate as a merchant banker and manager of its existing \nmutual funds. Conflicts of interests are inherent in ICB\u2019s operations as owner, operator, and \nself-regulator.  As  a  matter  of  practice,  the  ICB  mutual  funds  borrow  to  finance  equity \ninvestments, while privately managed funds are forbidden from doing so. Unlike private mutual \nfunds, ICB mutual funds are not regulated under the SEC rules and ICB is not required to \nsubmit  performance  reports.  Since  ICB  operations  also  lack  transparency,  its  actual \nperformance and financial position are subject to conjecture. \n \n6.  Nonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs)  face  uneven  competition  with  the  banks. \nCommercial banks are permitted to undertake leasing operations, but leasing companies cannot \nobtain a banking license. NBFIs are not given tax exemption for provisioning for nonperforming \nassets, which is enjoyed by banks. Under SEC regulations, banks are allowed to be merchant \nbankers, managers of public issues, underwriters and managers of mutual funds, giving rise to \npotential conflicts of interests. Experience also shows inherent dangers in commercial banks \nundertaking investment banking functions or investment banks managing mutual funds, while \nappropriate checks and balances are not in place and supervision remains relatively weak. \nComparable conditions are necessary to ensure fair and effective market competition and to \npromote greater private sector participation in resource mobilization.  \n \n7.  On the other hand, listed companies lack transparency and rules are perceived to favor \nmajority shareholders to the detriment of minority shareholders. Financial statements do not \nreflect the true financial condition of corporate entities and do not provide a reliable basis for \ninformed  decision  making  as  they  still  do  not  fully  comply  with  international  accounting \nstandards (IAS) and are not audited according to international standards on auditing (ISA). As of \nend-April 2003, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) had adopted only \n8 of the 34 IAS and 14 of the 46 ISA. However, ICAB does not have the authority to regulate the \naccounting profession and to ensure that such standards are followed and disclosure norms are \nfaithfully complied with. \n \n8.  Investments are highly retail in nature in the country and investors have limited recourse \nfor redress of grievances. Investors are also apparently unaware of their rights and obligations \nunder existing rules. Appropriate investment vehicles, as well as investment mechanisms, that \ncould operate effectively within the existing financial system still have to be explored. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA will help prepare a sector development program that will underpin the FMGP for \npromoting good governance in the Bangladesh financial markets to raise investor confidence \nand enable Bangladesh to compete effectively for funds in the international markets and to \nencourage greater investments in its domestic market. \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will focus on (i) strengthening regulatory and supervisory capacity; (ii) improving \ngovernance and operations of market intermediaries; (iii) strengthening corporate governance \nand  public  disclosures;  (iv)  raising  accounting  and  auditing  standards  to  comply  with \ninternational norms; and (v) enhancing market knowledge, institutional capacity, and skills of \nmarket participants. Findings and recommendations from previous and ongoing TAs of ADB and \nprojects of the World Bank and other donor agencies on these areas of focus will be reviewed.3 \n \n11.  Strengthening Regulatory and Supervisory Capacity. To strengthen the enforcement \ncapability of SEC, first, it must be vested with full powers to investigate, levy penalties, and \nimpose administrative sanctions, including laying down cease-and-desist orders, and must have \nother means to address malpractices in the financial markets. SEC\u2019s powers, and ability to \nsecure information, investigate and pursue criminal and civil cases against wrongdoers will have \nto be reviewed based on best practices and the provisions of local laws and rules. Second, \nSEC\u2019s capacity to regulate and supervise the domestic capital market needs to be improved. \nThe  proposed  TA  will  also  review  SEC\u2019s  rule-making  process  and  procedures  to  ensure \nappropriate stakeholder consultation when new laws are drafted or existing laws amended, and \nto recommend improvements to ensure greater transparency and adequate market participation \nand ownership. Considering best practices, the proposed TA will review the current structure, \nanalyze alternative measures for achieving greater autonomy particularly in SEC\u2019s decision-\nmaking process, and make suitable recommendations. \n \n12.  To upgrade the quality of its staff, SEC should provide competitive compensation and \nbenefits to attract experienced professionals and therefore may deviate from the civil service \npay scale and civil recruitment policies. SEC can have its own sources of revenues (possibly \nfrom fees, penalties, contributions, etc.) to enhance its independence from the government \nbudget. The proposed TA will review the funding, income, and salary practices of other security \nand exchange regulators in the region to provide useful models and recommend alternatives for \nthe Bangladesh SEC. \n \n13.  Improving Governance and Operations of Market Intermediaries. This component \nwill consider improvements in the governance structure of the two stock exchanges and analyze \nthe advantages and disadvantages of demutualization as well as of merging the exchanges. \nSuitable  recommendations  will  be  made  for  more  efficient  operations  and  more  effective \nintermediation functions. How best to promote institutional investments and strengthen the \noperations of NBFIs will also be analyzed. \n \n14.  Reforming the mutual funds industry entails addressing the role of ICB, which continues \nto be an impediment to increased institutional investments due to its entrenched privileges. In \nthe interest of transparency, an IAS audit of ICB should be conducted to reflect its true state of \noperations and financial position. Depending on the findings, the Government may undertake \nremedial measures to strengthen governance and eliminate potential conflicts of interest. That \nwill involve the valuation and transfer or sale of assets and liabilities. The fully separated ICB \nunits and its subsidiaries will have to be brought within the scope of SEC regulations. Ultimately, \nthe question of whether the Government is justified to continue to engage in such commercial \n                                                 \n3  ADB has been the main aid institution in financial markets. The World Bank has an ongoing Financial Institutions \nDevelopment Project with focus on developing term financing on a sustainable basis using NBFIs. As part of this \nloan, technical assistance is provided to SEC to develop issue rules for bonds and debentures. The World Bank \nalso provided training to ICAB in development of accounting and auditing standards in Bangladesh, which was \ncompleted in 2002. ", "4  \noperations as ICB does will be revisited. Mutual funds industry regulations will also be reviewed \nto identify impediments to the industry\u2019s accelerated development. \n \n15.  For improved governance of NBFIs and their future role in the Bangladesh financial \nmarket, the scope of their operations and the regulatory environment need to be clearly drawn. \nComparable conditions should be ensured by making incentives and market access uniform \nacross different financial institutions. In this way, market competition will be enhanced. The TA \nwill review current laws and regulations pertaining to banks and NBFIs and their merchant \nbanking, securities dealership, asset management, and leasing operations; and assess the \nadequacy of safeguards against conflicts of interest. The TA will also support, through policy \ndialogue  and  stakeholder  consultations,  the  introduction  of  a  legal  framework  for  secured \ntransactions and transparent electronic registry for movable assets.4  \n \n16.  Strengthening  Corporate  Governance  and  Public  Disclosures.  Corporate \ngovernance will be strengthened by adopting best practices on (i) the structure of the boards of \ndirectors and the role of independent directors; (ii) protection of minority shareholders; (iii) \ntransparency;  (iv)  setting  up  a  commission  to  revise  the  Companies  Act  1994; and (v) \nformulating a code of corporate governance. Some provisions in the Companies Act 1994 must \nbe  reviewed:  independence  and  responsibilities  of  board  members;  management \naccountabilities; internal controls; shareholders\u2019 rights and protection of minority interests; and \ndisclosure  requirements.  Considering  the  recommendations  in  the  ADB  advisory  TA,5 the \nproposed TA will review amendments to the Companies Act and other legislative and regulatory \namendments, assess corporate governance structures and practices in Bangladesh, and help \nformulate an action program for corporate governance reforms. \n \n17.  Strengthening Accounting and Auditing. The accounting and auditing component has \nthree elements: (i) phased adoption of IAS and ISA and how it can be expeditiously carried out, \n(ii) setting up an accountancy board to implement and monitor compliance with international \nstandards, and (iii) strengthening ICAB to enable it to operate as a self-regulatory body. It is \nproposed that the accountancy board be responsible for  accrediting accounting practitioners \nand auditing firms and for  enforcing professional standards and ethics. The TA will look at \ncomparative practices and will coordinate with the  World Bank's program to enact a new \nFinancial Reporting Act, amend accounting and auditing provisions of related laws, enhance the \ncapacity  of  regulatory  agencies  and  professional  bodies,  and  improve  the  programs  in \naccounting and auditing of training institutes (including universities and colleges).6 \n \n18.  Enhancing  Market  Knowledge,  Institutional  Capacity,  and  Skills  of  Market \nParticipants. To upgrade the know-how of market participants, including company directors, in \ndischarging their responsibilities, the TA will assess (i) the feasibility of setting up training \nfacilities or (ii) using existing facilities for the purpose. In case (i), the alternatives are individual \ntraining facilities at the stock exchanges or SEC and a common Financial Markets Institute that \nmay be attached to an educational institution. In support of skills development, the following \nmerit  attention:  (i)  assessing  priority  skills  needs  of  financial  market  institutions  (NBFIs, \nmerchant banks, securities firms,  and asset management companies); (ii) syllabi for various \nskills development courses, including seminars on roles, duties, and responsibilities of company \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2003.

In the final analysis, a knowledgeable, responsive \nmarket is the best assurance that market players conduct themselves properly and exercise \ngood governance. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $690,000 equivalent comprising of $496,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $194,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  $550,000 \nequivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign exchange cost and $54,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will contribute the balance of the local currency cost equivalent to $140,000 in kind \nfor office space and facilities, counterpart staff, local transportation, and administrative and \nsecretariat support. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The Government \nwas advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing program or \nproject. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance (FD-MOF) will be the Executing Agency \nfor the TA. The FD-MOF will assign full-time counterpart staff to work closely with the TA \nconsultants and  will coordinate support needed to implement the TA. A steering committee, \nchaired  by  the  Finance  Secretary  will  be  set  up.  Members  will  be  from  the  Ministry  of \nCommerce,  Planning  Commission,  SEC,  Bangladesh  Bank,  and  private  sector  institutions \nincluding ICAB, professional bodies, and chambers of commerce and industry. The committee \nwill meet bi-monthly, or more frequently as needed, to monitor and guide TA implementation. \n \n21.  Implementation will cover 5 months, starting in  January 2004 and with completion in \nJune 2004. A team of consultants from a firm will provide  21 person-months of consulting \nservices (13.5 international and 7.5 domestic). ADB will select and engage the consulting firm in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The quality-based selection method for selecting the \nconsulting firm will be used because the program is complex covering several subsectors, debt \nand equity markets, and market participants. Furthermore, the issues are highly sensitive and \nwill require high-level policy interaction with government officials and extensive consultations \nwith other stakeholders, particularly aid agencies, in the field. Selected consultants will have a \nhigh level of credibility and competence. Consultant selection will use a simplified technical \nproposal. Equipment procured will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nOutline terms of reference are in Appendix  3. The consultants will submit to FD-MOF, the \nsteering committee, and ADB an inception report 3 weeks after TA starts, a midterm report at \nthe end of the third month, a draft final report 3 weeks before TA completion, and a final report \non TA completion. The recommendations of the draft final report will be discussed at a tripartite \nmeeting. A workshop will be held to present TA outputs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for Preparing the Financial Markets Governance Program, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Sector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty analysis?  Yes  poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n   \nThe interim poverty reduction strategy paper (I-PRSP),  The poverty partnership agreement was signed in 2000 \nentitled A National Strategy for Economic Growth, Poverty  with the Government of Bangladesh aimed at reducing \nReduction and Social Development, dated December 2002,  both income and human poverty over the medium term \nreflects Government\u2019s strong commitment to poverty  (2005) and the long term (2010). ADB\u2019s strategy \nreduction, and notes the various means of targeting  includes continued support for developing basic \ndifferent sectors for achieving this goal. The I-PRSP notes:  physical and social infrastructure, with more emphasis \n\u201cA sound and well functioning financial system is required  on governance and environment issues. A noticeable \nfor ensuring growth and providing access to financial  contribution to poverty reduction is envisaged through \nresources to the poor.\u201d Poor governance, lack of discipline,  improved macroeconomic management including \nand inadequate disclosure and transparency are  integrated efforts to improve governance, resulting in \nfundamental problems afflicting the financial sector in  key policy and institutional changes to increase private \nBangladesh.  sector participation and improve sector efficiency. \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh: \n \nFinancial markets governance will increase the flow of resources to finance productive investments, improve the \nprocess of financial intermediation, and promote efficiency through enhanced market competition. Different social \ngroups (investors, savers, market participants, enterprises and their employees, suppliers, and customers, and other \nstakeholders) will benefit from a deeper, more sound, and more stable financial system. The Financial Markets \nGovernance Program will have an indirect but important strategic role in reducing poverty. With enhanced efficiency in \nmobilizing and allocating funds and proper enforcement mechanism in place, the Government may use cost savings \nfrom efficient financial markets for poverty reduction and social development. Transparency in the flow of financial \nresources is expected to remove inherent structural impediments to financial sector growth that result from an \ninefficient, opaque financial system. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                            Improved governance/ Economic development \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nInappropriate governance is mainly responsible for abnormal practices in the financial markets such as insider lending, \ninsider trading, accounting and auditing wrongdoings, etc. It constrains overall private sector growth and potential \ninvestor participation. To enhance investor confidence and promote economic growth, intensified reforms are needed \nto strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework, strengthen corporate governance and market discipline, and \napply international accounting and auditing standards. The reforms should be backed by relevant fiscal incentives, \nincluding investment in human capacity development, that have broader poverty and social impacts. The key focus of \npoverty analysis is on identifying structural impediments to adopting and implementing proper governance reforms. To \nthe extent that these impediments cause failure in achieving efficiencies in the financial markets, the benefits to \nvarious social groups will be less. The poor and disadvantaged may be expected to have a smaller share of benefits to \nbe realized from the reforms. Government intervention through social programs is needed to allocate to the poor and \ndisadvantaged funds generated from efficient financial markets and economic growth.  \n \nPoverty in Bangladesh. Progress in reducing poverty in Bangladesh has, to some extent, been successful over the \nlast decade, with poverty rates declining from 59% to 50%. However, high national poverty rates are still of major \nconcern. Substantial urban-rural and regional disparities exist. Slower progress on structural reforms, rising revenue-\nexpenditure gaps, the unstable financial condition of government-owned financial institutions, and the drain on the \nbudget of the large number of state-owned enterprises together adversely affect Government\u2019s fiscal position and limit \nthe stimulating effect on economic growth. The government budget deficit is 4-5% and is largely financed through \nsubstantial flow of external assistance. Bangladesh was able to achieve 5% growth of real gross domestic product \n(GDP) in FY2002; however, revenue, savings, and investments as ratios of the GDP are extremely low. In FY2002, \ntotal government spending on social safety net programs was only 1% of GDP and 5.6% of total government \nexpenditures. Through extensive assistance by aid organizations and support from the Government, social sectors \nsuch as education, health, and nutrition have made reasonable progress. Joint efforts on the development of social \nsector programs should continue. Some of the savings that the Government would make from efficient financial \nmarkets would augment the budget for its social sector program. ", "Appendix 1  7\n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis?  Yes \n \nGovernment agencies, chambers of commerce and industry, trade associations, aid organizations and the financial \nand private sector, and existing and potential foreign and domestic financial market participants. \n \nParticipation strategy?  Yes \n \nThe participation strategy will involve consultation and feedback from concerned stakeholders on issues concerning \nfinancial markets governance. The derived outcome will be used to identify, prioritize, and address governance \nconcerns and develop recommendations leading to actions.  \n \n \nD.         Gender and Development \nThere is no specific strategy of maximizing impact on women. However, it is envisaged that encouraging proper \nfunctioning of the financial markets will lead to increased direct and indirect investments from foreign as well as \ndomestic institutional and individual investors. Companies will benefit as a result of greater availability of financial \nresources at lower costs. Improved profitability, asset growth, and expansion of business will generate more \nemployment and increased disposable income for average households, where women have a central role. When \nfamilies are no longer at the subsistence level of existence and women are not tied to household chores, women are \nable to seize economic opportunities to augment their family income through micro or small enterprise pursuits. \n \nNo gender plan has been prepared. \n \n \nE.
