During the Country Programming Mission in December 2007, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for a policy study on transport efficiency through logistics \ndevelopment.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Beijing  in  August  2008,  during  which  an \nagreement was reached with the Government on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, methodology, key \nactivities, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements, as well as the \nmission\u2019s observations. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. This TA has \nalso been included in the ADB nonlending program for the PRC for 2008.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s continuous economic growth, since the start of its economic reforms in 1978, \nhas been accompanied by a rapid increase in demand for transport and logistics.2 Freight traffic \ngrew from 983 billion ton-kilometers (km) in 1978 to over 10 trillion ton-km in 2007, an annual \ngrowth rate of 8.4%. Of this, road freight grew by 13.7% annually, coastal and inland waterway \nfreight by 10.3% annually, and railway freight by 5.3% annually.3 The total value of the PRC\u2019s \nlogistics4 industry grew by an average of 21% from 2000 to 2007 and is anticipated to continue \ngrowing  rapidly.  The  Government  is  allocating  greater  resources  to  expand  the  transport \ninfrastructure  in  order  to  remove  bottlenecks  and  to  improve  accessibility.  However, \ninfrastructure investment cannot keep pace with the transport demand, which has put increasing \npressure  on  the  transport  system.  Developing  an  efficient  logistics  industry  is  becoming \nincreasingly  important  for  sustainable  economic  growth,  trade  performance,  environmental \nprotection, and poverty reduction in the PRC. \n \n3.  The PRC faces challenges to efficient logistics development. The ratio of total logistics \ncost5 to gross domestic product represents the efficiency of logistics operation in the economy. \ni.e.,  the lower the ratio, the better the efficiency. Despite the PRC\u2019s ratio declining from 21.2% in \n1991 to 18.4% in 2007, it is still double that of developed countries. Moreover, the share of \nlogistics cost of finished products in the PRC is much higher than the normal range of 10%\u201325% \nfor  an  efficient  operation\u2014particularly  in  inland  regions\u2014further  reflecting  a  needed \nimprovement in its logistics development.  \n \n4.  Transport  is  an  integral  element  of  the  logistics  supply  chain.  In  Organisation  for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, transport cost accounts for a \nquarter of all logistics cost. In the PRC, although the transport system is rapidly improving, \ntransport costs still accounted for 54% of the total logistics cost as of 2007\u2014the greatest \namount among all cost components. Tolls are a major cost for transport users and contribute to \noversized and overweight trucks and the diversion of through-traffic to less appropriate routes. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 September 2008. \n2  Logistics is defined as the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient and effective flow and \nstorage of goods, services, and related information from the point of origin to point of consumption to meet \ncustomer requirements. The goal of logistics is to have the right thing at the right place at the right time for the right \ncost. \n3  The modal split for freight tonnage carried was 72% for roads, 14% for railways, 12% for coastal and inland \nwaterways, and 2% for pipelines and civil aviation. The modal split for freight ton-km was 63% for coastal and \ninland waterways, 24% for railways, 11% for roads, and 2% for pipelines and civil aviation. \n4  The total logistics value represents the total value of final products delivered to end-users after utilizing logistics \nservices.  \n5  The logistics cost includes costs associated with transport; warehousing and storage; management; packaging, \nprocessing, and distribution; loss and damage; and interest incurred through carrying out the logistics activities. \n ", "2   \nIn addition, higher empty backhaul rates, dated material handling and warehousing, higher \ndamage rates, and inefficient distribution of goods are other transport cost items higher in the \nPRC than in developed countries. Furthermore, moving goods between provinces can be a \nchallenge due to local protectionism. \n \n5.  Inefficient  logistics  also  result  in  increased  energy  consumption  and  air  pollution \nconcerns; unsurprisingly, the PRC is the world\u2019s fastest growing oil consumer. From 2000 to \n2005, the transport sector\u2019s consumption of petroleum increased from 25% to 30% of total use \nand is projected to reach 50% in 2020. To cope with emerging environmental issues, policies \nand measures to increase transport energy efficiency are highly desirable, such as raising the \nquality of transport services, raising vehicle standards (with greater use of containers and larger, \nmulti-axle  trucks),  and  fostering  integrated  logistics  service  provider  development.  Further \ndeveloping inland waterway transport can also lower environmental impact in terms of high \nenergy efficiency per ton-km. Most importantly, the focus should gradually shift away from the \nconstruction of new infrastructure to more effective utilization of existing infrastructure. \n \n6.  The major challenges of the logistics industry include the following.  \n \n(i)  There is a lack of coordination among different government departments and \norganizations. As government agencies are structured along modal lines, they \nmanage intermodal issues mainly from their own perspectives. This results in an \narray  of  fragmented  legal  and  regulatory  structures,  inconsistent  technology \nstandards, and lack of interoperability between different transport modes. \n \n(ii)  Due  to  imbalanced  infrastructure,  transport  bottlenecks  and  gaps  in  the \ninterconnectivity between modes still exist, particular in central and western PRC \nand rural regions. \n \n(iii)  Trucking and barge companies are fragmented and consist of many small owner-\noperators,6 lacking efficiency in terms of economies of scale. No single company \ncommands  more  than  2%  of  the  market  or  provides  nationwide  intermodal \ntransport services. Lack of standardized container-carrying wagons or container \ntrucks  has  led  to  additional  costs  in  loading  and  reloading,  especially  when \nmultimodal transport is used, resulting in low truck productivity levels.7 In addition, \nlogistics services\u2019 poor credibility and integrity acts as another barrier to efficient \nlogistics. \n \n(iv)  Inadequate  human  resources,  many  of  whom  lack  logistics  management \nknowledge and skills, hamper the industry\u2019s further growth.  \n \n7.  Optimizing transport systems through advanced logistics solutions is a proven strategy \nin the developed countries. Third-party logistics (3PLs), a new and developing industry in the \nPRC,  offer  integrated  services  to  meet  companies\u2019  supply  chain  needs.  At  present,  most \ndomestic manufacturing and commercial enterprises manage their own logistics operations, with \nonly 15% outsourcing their logistics functions. As a result, 3PLs\u2019 share of the logistics market is \nsignificantly lower compared to that in the developed countries. Fostering the development of \n3PLs will put pressure on small logistics operators to improve services, simulate the growth of \nmodern technology, reduce logistics cost, and improve quality of transport services. \n                                                 \n6  Most barge and trucking firms have one to three vehicles and self-powered small vessels. \n7  The average annual output per truck in Canada is 12 times more than the output in the PRC. \n ", "3 \n8.  As a key element of efficient logistics, multimodal integration will enable users to choose \nthe most cost-effective transport mode for specific types of freight, lower average transport \ncosts, and raise energy efficiency. The key characteristic of multimodal transport is the carriage \nof  goods  by  two  or  more  transport  modes,  under  one  contract,  using  one  consignment \ndocument and one responsible party for the entire carriage. Presently, each transport mode \ntends  to  be  developed,  managed,  and  regulated  in  isolation,  and  missing  infrastructure \nelements within a mode and between modes prevent seamless multimodal supply chains. More \nattention also needs to be paid to modal interfaces such as inland terminals, container stations, \nand cargo clearance facilities. Balanced multimodal investment and development will create a \nsystem that exploits the comparative economic advantages of different modes to benefit the \ntransport system and the population. Furthermore, establishment of a uniform regulatory and \nlegal regime is crucial for successful multimodal transport. \n \n9.  Inland  waterways  must  also  become  a  policy  focus.  In  addition  to  lowering \nenvironmental impact (para. 5), most PRC water routes run from west to east, linking inland \nsources of minerals and agriculture products to the major eastern seaboard markets. Therefore, \ninland  waterways  are  well  positioned  to  serve  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  develop  inland \nprovinces.  \n \n10.  While most logistics services are provided by the private sector, governments have a \nsignificant role to play in creating the appropriate policy framework conditions by (i) integrating \nlogistics in the transport policy agenda; (ii) adopting a multimodal approach; (iii) improving the \neffective and efficient use of existing infrastructure through closer intergovernment coordination, \ncompetition policy, pricing reform, and public\u2013private partnership; (iv) promoting the use of \ninformation technology through education and human resources development; (v) raising safety \nstandards; and (vi) strengthening monitoring mechanisms. Further, government involvement is \ncritical in addressing information asymmetries (i.e., correcting situations where one or more \nparties  in  a  transaction  possess  information  not  known  to  other  parties);  and  negative \nexternalities (e.g., making a polluter pay through taxes and promoting a modal shift to more \nenvironmentally friendly modes, especially in urban areas and congested corridors). \n \n11.  Recognizing  that  the  policy  focus  had  been  unimodal  rather  than  multimodal,  the \nGovernment created the Ministry of Transport (MOT) in April 2008, which incorporates the \nformer Ministry of Communications. Aviation, maritime concerns, roads, postal services, and \nurban public transport are among the new MOT\u2019s functions. Its major responsibilities include: \n(i) designing the layouts, policies, and standards of the development of roads, waterways, and \ncivil aviation; and (ii) establishing a convenient, smooth, efficient, safe, and integrated transport \nsystem in the PRC. MOT therefore seeks to learn from international experiences and best \npractices in transport and logistics management. \n \n12.  The Government has given high priority to logistics development and included it in the \n11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). Therefore, consistent with the plan and aligned with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for the PRC,8 this TA aims to assist the Government in developing \na  framework  strategy,  policies,  action  plans,  and  implementation  mechanisms  for  efficient \nlogistics development. Further, the TA supports ADB\u2019s strategy by (i) facilitating inclusive growth \nand  balanced  development  by  promoting  an  integrated  and  coordinated  transport  system, \n(ii) improving  resource  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability  by  promoting  sustainable \nmobility, and (iii) promoting public\u2013private partnerships in multimodal transport and logistics \nservices. Inclusive growth and balanced development in the PRC depends on improving its \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA\u2019s impact will be an efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly transport logistics \nsystem in the PRC. The TA\u2019s outcome will include a policy framework, measures, action plans, \nand operational guidelines that can be adopted by MOT and local governments in the PRC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The  TA  will  focus  on:  (i)  undertaking  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  PRC\u2019s  current \nlogistics  development,  focusing  on  the  economic,  legal,  organizational,  institutional,  and \nregulatory conditions of intermodal transport services; (ii) identifying key issues to develop in the \nlogistics  industry;  (iii)  learning  from  international  experiences  and  good  practices  from \ndeveloped  countries  where  multimodal  transport  and  logistics  are  efficiently  managed; \n(iv) recommending specific changes to regulatory frameworks to achieve the transport sector\u2019s \ndesired goals; (v) preparing recommendations, including comprehensive best practices, policy \nnotes on policy frameworks, measures, action plans by particular agencies, and implementation \nmechanisms  with  a  realistic  indicative  timetable  for  implementation;  (vi)  carrying  out  case \nstudies in three provinces (east, west, and central) to analyze approaches to implementing \nrecommendations;  (vii)  developing  operating  guidelines  to  assist  local  governments  in \nimplementing  recommended  policies  and  measures;  and  (viii)  undertaking  workshops  for \nconsultation with stakeholders and disseminating findings.  \n \n15.  International experts and national consultants will be engaged for the TA. The TA will be \nundertaken in close consultation with concerned central and provincial governments and will \ntake into consideration all previous studies carried out by the Government, ADB, and other \nmultilateral agencies, as well as best international practices. The TA will involve fieldwork; \ngathering  international  experiences;  analytical  research;  and  stakeholder  consultations  with \nnational  and  provincial  governments,  the  private  sector, international  and  national  logistics \nproviders, customers, and international development partners. Capacity-building support will be \nprovided  through  international  and  national  training  programs  to  implement  TA  outputs. \nWorkshops\u2014at inception, interim, and draft final report stages of TA implementation\u2014will be \norganized to discuss and review the TA\u2019s findings, and a seminar will be organized at the final \nreport stage to disseminate these findings.  \n \n16.  The TA will include case studies from the three selected provinces to identify barriers to \nlogistics development that can be overcome through sound policy measures and other means.9 \nThe case studies will also pilot test TA recommendations and operating guidelines. \n \n                                                 \n9  The final selection of the three case study provinces will be made during TA contract negotiations. Provinces that \nare willing to provide their own counterpart staff and resources for field studies will be considered. \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $625,000 equivalent. The Government has requested that \nADB finance $500,000 equivalent on a grant basis through ADB\u2019s TA funding program. MOT will \nprovide the remaining $125,000 equivalent in counterpart staff, office space, furniture, and other \nsupport services. The cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  MOT will be the Executing Agency for the TA. It will assign appropriate counterpart staff \nto assist the consultants and form a project steering committee, which will be chaired by a \ndeputy  director  general  of  the  Comprehensive  Planning  Department.  It  will  include  senior \nofficials from MOT\u2019s Comprehensive Planning Department, Waterway Transport Department, \nHighway  Transport  Development,  Institutional  Reform  and  Legal  Affairs  Department,  and \nFinance Department; relevant officers of ministries and agencies concerned. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented from May 2009 to December 2010. Consulting services \ntotaling 39 person-months (9 international and 30 national) will be required. The terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB through a national firm associated with an \ninternational firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time) on the basis of the quality of the proposal (90%) and the cost (10%) \nof  the  services  to  be  provided  using  simplified  technical  proposal  procedures.  The  90:10 \nweighting is considered appropriate because the TA is a complex multidisciplinary assignment \nthat requires innovation and creativity, and the quality of the consulting services will have a \nsignificant impact on the ensuing policies and guidelines. Disbursement will be undertaken in \nline with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to \ntime). All reports by the consultants will be prepared in English and translated into Chinese. The \nconsultants will maintain close working relations with ADB and MOT and will regularly discuss \nprogress and findings. Tripartite meetings involving ADB, the consultants, and MOT will be held \nto provide guidance to the consultants and to review their reports.  \n \n21.  MOT will provide a suitably furnished office with utilities and telecommunication access, \nmaterials, maps, data, and documents required by the TA, and will cover the cost of utilities for \nthe consultants, counterpart professional staff, and support staff. TA equipment will be procured \nby the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007) and transferred to \nMOT upon completion of the TA. \n \nIV.

General \n1.  The  consultants  will  perform  their  tasks  in  close  consultation  with  the  Ministry  of \nTransportation  (MOT)  and  other  responsible  central,  provincial,  and  local  government \ndepartments and agencies to ensure full acceptance of the outcome of the technical assistance \n(TA). The TA is estimated to require 39 person-months of professional input (9 person-months \ninternational,  30  person-months  national).  The  consultants  should  demonstrate  extensive \nconsulting skills and experiences in the field of: (i) policy and institutional (5 person-months \ninternational, 5 person-months national); (ii) transport system and logistics operations (2 person-\nmonth international, 10 person-months national); (iii) transport logistics economics and policy \nanalysis  (2  person-months  international,  5  person-months  national);  (iv)  transport  law  and \neconomic  regulations  (5  person-months  national);  (v) freight  information  and  technology \n(5 person-months national). \n \n2.  The consultants should propose their own staffing schedule in the technical proposal, \nmust demonstrate the range of skills and experience required and a well planned and balanced \ndeployment  of  time  from  each  team  member  to  meet  the  TA  objectives.  The  assignment \nrequires a strong commitment from a team Leader, deputy team leader, and the core team. \n \n3.  The team leader/national logistics specialist will, in addition to technical functions, have \noverall responsibility for the effective and timely implementation of the TA. This consultant will \nfoster close coordination between international and national consultants and coordinate with the \nExecuting  Agency  (EA),  other  related  government  agencies,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB), and other international organizations doing related work in partnership with ADB. The \nteam leader will periodically report progress to the EA and ADB, and submit high-quality reports \nto both. \n \n4.  The deputy team leader/international policy and institutional specialist will, in addition to \ntechnical  functions,  work  closely  with  the  team  leader  to  establish  and  maintain  good \ncoordination with the EA, other related government agencies, ADB, and other international \norganizations. This consultant will assist the team leader in reporting progress periodically and \nsubmitting high-quality reports to the EA and ADB, and will be responsible for ensuring the high \nquality of the English versions of the inception report, interim report, and draft final report. \n \nB.
