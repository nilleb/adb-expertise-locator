INTRODUCTION   \n1.  The nonsovereign capacity development technical assistance (TA) will be an integral \npart  of  a  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  investment  to  support  AccessBank \nAzerbaijan (ABA) and Finca Azerbaijan (FIA). The selection of these two financial institutions for \nthe TA will encourage improved provision of rural finance through bank and nonbank financial \ninstitutions using alternative approaches, including mobile banking, new financial and advisory \nproducts, comprehensive banking services, and enhancement of deposit mobilization in local \ncurrency.  \n \n2.  ABA was established in 2002 and is Azerbaijan\u2019s sixth largest bank. It has a strong \nregional footprint, with 66% of its loan volume and 78% of its loans outside the capital area. \nABA employs 2,277 staff in 43 branches, of which 28 branches are in the regions.  \n \n3.  FIA was established in 1998 serving 153,000 clients covering small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) (2%) and microenterprises (98%), 55% of which are farmers. FIA has a very \nstrong rural footprint, representing over 80% of its loan volume. FIA employs over 1,200 staff in \n65 branches, of which over 55 are in the regions.  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n4.  Azerbaijan\u2019s  anticipated  exhaustion  of  oil  and  gas  resources  by  2050  calls  for \ndiversification of the economy. A special focus is needed on improving agricultural productivity, \nwhich generated only 5.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013. Most of Azerbaijan\u2019s \n9.2 million  residents  live  in  rural  districts  (47%)  and  regional  towns  (31%).  Although  rural \neconomic activity contributes less than 10% to GDP, it supports 78% of the population and 38% \nof employment. Many rural Azerbaijanis are engaged in low-productivity agriculture, trapped in \nlowly  paid  jobs,  and  have  not  benefited  from  poverty  reduction  at  similar  rates  as  urban \nresidents.1 The growth of economic activity is of particular significance in rural areas, as it \nprovides major benefits for low-income families and stimulates demand for goods and services \nproduced by farmers and MSMEs. Azerbaijan\u2019s agricultural productivity is hampered by low \nquality standards, small land plots, inadequate infrastructure, lack of knowledge and skills, and \nlow access to finance. Food and livestock production, storage, processing, and trading to meet \ndomestic  and  export  demand  provide  potential  for  productivity  growth  as  well  as  poverty \nreduction.  \n \n5.  With  the  collapse  of the  Soviet  Union,  the  agriculture  sector\u2019s  contribution  to GDP \ncontracted from 20% (2001) to 5% (2013). Since independence, 1.3 million hectares of farmland \nhave  been  distributed  to  850,000  rural  households.  Small  private  farmers  owning  up  to \n3 hectares now produce more than 90% of the agricultural output; the government continues to \nown most of the pastureland, and cattle farmers may obtain grazing rights from municipalities. \nAgricultural output is equally divided between livestock, cereals, and horticulture (2013). Since \n2000, urbanization increased while the rural population remained almost stable. While cereal \nproduction substantially improved at a CAGR of nearly 8% during 2000\u20132009, it has remained \nstagnant since.  \n \n6.  Agriculture  has  significant  potential  for  growth  in  Azerbaijan  given  its  climatic  and \ngeographic advantages, such as having 9 different climate zones (out of 12 in the world) and \nspring arriving 1 month before the Russian Federation. This diverse seasonality is particularly \n                                                \n1 H. Onder. 2013. Azerbaijan: Inclusive Growth in a Resource-Rich Economy. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n ", "2   \nan advantage for southern and eastern regions, with Azerbaijan\u2019s presence in the food markets \nof the Russian Federation (unprocessed fruits, vegetables, nuts, edible oils, fats, cotton, tea, \nand sugar) and Georgia (sugar, animal feed, and wheat flour). Opportunities to improve value \naddition  include  enhancing  the  processing  of  such  products  in  Azerbaijan.  However,  the \ndevelopment of new products and markets will require investment to improve both productivity \nand quality by applying modern technology and international standards.  \n \n7.  After  the collapse  of the  Soviet  Union,  macroeconomic  shocks  and financial  crises \nundermined public confidence in Azerbaijan\u2019s banking system. As a result, the penetration of \nfinancial intermediation remains low. Bank penetration in regions remains low, as many villages \ndo not have access to basic financial services. Azerbaijan\u2019s regions, which account for 78% of \nthe population and 62% of total entrepreneurs,2 receive only 16% of bank lending.3 Supporting \nthe outreach of financial services to the regions will have major qualitative impacts on the \neconomy and people by stimulating rural income and employment, in addition to supporting \ndiversification.  \n \n8.  Banks hold about 95% of finance sector assets, and nonbank financial institutions hold \nthe remaining 5%. The banking sector is dominated by the state-owned International Bank of \nAzerbaijan, which holds about 35% of banking system assets.4 However, banking assets are \nwell diversified, with the second largest bank holding 5% of bank assets, the 15 largest second-\ntier banks holding 45% of system assets, and the remaining 28 third-tier banks holding the \nbalance. Total capital adequacy of the banking system  was 18% in 2013, well above the \nregulatory minimum of 12%. Banks reported acceptable past due loans at 5.1% of total loans in \n2013.5 Bank loans have increased at a CAGR of 22% over 2007\u20132013, with private banks \n(26%)  outpacing  the  International  Bank  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  growth  (16%).  The  finance  sector \nremains significantly dependent on external commercial borrowing. Loan\u2013deposit ratios remain \nhigh at 160% (2013), reflecting low public confidence in the banking system, and pointing to \ncontinued demand for external inflows. Obtaining long-term funds remains a challenge for banks. \nThe economy remains highly dollarized, with banks issuing about 30% of loans in foreign \ncurrency. \n   \n9.  The Azerbaijan Microfinance Association has 33 members, including nonbank financial \ninstitutions  and  banks.  The  association  reported  $1.4  billion  microloans  (or  2%  of  GDP) \noutstanding at 31 August 2014, representing more than 600,000 borrowers and an average loan \nsize of $2,320. Women borrowers comprise 26%. From 2008 to August 2014, micro loans grew \nstrongly at a CAGR of 19.3%. The association reports overall very good portfolio quality of its \nmembers\u2014their average nonperforming loan ratio has never exceeded 3.3%.  \n \n10.  Access to financial services remains low, with branch penetration of only 9.6 branches \nper 1,000 people (2012). Because of its widely spread population and terrain, the provision of \nbanking services is costly in remote areas. Bank lending in rural areas is also limited by the \nriskiness of agricultural loans, lack of financial information on borrowers, and limited availability \nof real collateral in rural areas.  \n \n11.  Bank deposit mobilization is weak in Azerbaijan. A survey conducted by Gallup in 2011 \nindicates that  only  15%  of the  adult  population  interviewed  had  an  account  with  a formal \n                                                \n2  World Bank Group. 2014. Azerbaijan Partnership Program Snapshot. Washington, DC. \n3  Government of Azerbaijan, Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 2014. Monthly Bulletin. September. Baku. \n4  The International Bank of Azerbaijan is one of two majority state-owned banks in Azerbaijan. \n5  The reported overdue loans and nonperforming loans are to be treated with caution, as individual banks may follow \ndifferent standards in classifying and provisioning for their loan books.    \n ", "  3 \nfinancial institution, and only 2% of those who saved during the preceding year had done so \nthrough formal financial institutions.6 This highlights the population\u2019s mistrust in the banking \nsystem and the limited ability of financial institutions to provide quality deposit services. \n      \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impacts will be (i) the expansion of private banking services in Azerbaijan\u2019s regions, \nwith a special focus on agriculture and rural regions; and (ii) the expansion of private banking \ndeposit services.  \n \n13.   The first outcome will be that ABA increases local currency deposit mobilization from \nretail customers. Outputs for ABA are (i) a new deposit mobilization strategy and business plan \nare  developed,  (ii)  staff  customer  service  skills  are  improved,  (iii)  mobile  and  self-service \nbanking service channels are developed and rolled out, and (iv) a new deposit service concept \nis tested and retail local currency deposits increased.  \n \n14.   The second outcome will be that FIA demonstrates the sustainability of lending to SMEs \nand farmers in Azerbaijan\u2019s regions and increases its service reach to more remote regions. \nOutputs for FIA are that (i) an improved MSME lending process is designed and tested, (ii) SME \nloans with a special focus on agriculture are well accepted, and (iii) commercially viable mobile \nservice approaches to remote regions are designed and tested.  \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities   \n15.  ABA\u2019s  management  recognizes  the  large  underserved  potential  of  rural  dwellers, \nespecially farm households and agriculture-related SMEs. A lack of awareness of rural dwellers \nof  market  opportunities  and  skills  to  plan  and  manage  a growing  business  are  significant \nchallenges. As a result, ABA is preparing a strategy to improve the financial literacy of its clients \nand to build their awareness of the benefits of saving. ABA is developing a strategy to provide \ncomprehensive  services  and  to  enhance  deposits.  The  strategy  to  provide  comprehensive \nservices  includes  (i)  financial  literacy  training  and  business  planning,  (ii)  human  resource \nmanagement and skills development, (iii) marketing, and (iv) innovative services and product \noffering. The strategy will dovetail with the design and testing of innovative financial services \nproducts to meet customer needs and increase customer loyalty.  \n \n16.  The deposit enhancement strategy will entail (i) the design, testing, and rollout of new \ndeposit products, including marketing through cross-selling to its borrowers and products based \non branchless banking; and (ii) establishing test branches where staff are trained to focus on \ncustomer services. ABA plans to develop a wider deposit base with longer tenors, encourage a \nculture of savings, and promote de-dollarization by focusing on local currency deposits. \n \n \n18.  In response to market demand, FIA raised the upper lending limit from $50,000 to \n$100,000\u2014expecting the SME segment to grow from 1.7% (2014) to 10.0% by 2017. FIA puts \nparticular focus on agricultural SMEs. FIA\u2019s SME clients are often existing clients that have \ngraduated  from  microenterprise  status\u2014requiring  larger  financing  and  more  sophisticated \n                                                \n6  A.

To address underserved remote villages that are difficult to serve through branch \npresence, FIA intends to improve service outreach through mobile delivery channels. These \nmay  include  branchless  services  through  electronic  banking  and  physical  delivery  through \nmobile staff and/or agents.  \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,150,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). ABA and FIA will \nfund significant parts of the TA, which is estimated to be no less than 35% of the total TA cost.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ADB  is  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  and  ABA  and  FIA  are  its  beneficiaries. \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  either  as  individuals  or  through  qualified  firms.  ADB  will \ncompetitively select the consultants for the TA and supervise their outputs in close coordination \nwith ABA and FIA, in each case in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). ADB-funded contracts will be disbursed by ADB in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time) and supervised by ADB. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. The TA implementation is expected to begin in May 2015 and be completed by \n31 December 2017.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding $750,000 on a grant basis for Capacity Building \nfor Rural Financial Inclusion in Azerbaijan, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData \nSources and  Assumptions and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Risks \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   \nImpacts (2022)       Assumption \nExpansion of private  Commercial bank credit in  CBAR  Banks develop their \nbanking services in  regions outside the capital,  reports  ability to service rural \nAzerbaijan\u2019s regions   Baku, increased to more than    markets. \n  20% from 16% (September     \n  2014)      Risks \n      Political risks \n  Commercial bank credit to     \nVolatility of oil subsector \n  agriculture sector increased) to   \n \n  more than 10% from 5%    Currency risk \n  (September 2014)    \n     \nExpansion of private  At least 20% of adults have a  Global \nbanking deposit  deposit account with a formal  Findex data \nservices   financial institution  base \nOutcomes (2019)      Assumption \nABA increases local  ABA\u2019s volume of local currency  ABA reports  Proven demand for new \ncurrency  deposits from  deposits from retail customers    deposit products and \nretail customers   increases to AZN500 million    agriculture and SME \n  from AZN200 million (November    lending \n  2014)      \nFIA demonstrates the       Risks \nsustainability of lending  FIA SME borrowers exceed  FIA reports  Regulatory risks  \nto SMEs and farmers in  500 from 110 in September   \nClimate  \nAzerbaijan\u2019s regions and  2014 \n \nincreases its service    Agriculture risks \nreach to more remote  FIA rural SME borrowers \nregions   exceed 150 from 10 in \nSeptember 2014 \n \nOutputs (2017)      Assumption \nABA       \n(i)  deposit  Branch pilot test successfully  ABA reports  Continued top \nmobilization strategy and  introduces new local currency    management support  \nbusiness plan are  retail deposit products based on     \ndeveloped,   service orientation and value     \n(ii)  staff customer  addition      \nservice skills are     \nimproved,      \n(iii)  mobile and self-    \nservice banking service     \nchannels are developed     \nand rolled out, and      \n(iv)  a new deposit     \nservice concept is tested     \nand retail  local currency     \ndeposits increased     \n     \nFIA     \nimproved MSME lending  New SME loan product is  FIA reports \nprocess is designed and  profitable  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nData \nSources and  Assumptions and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Risks \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   \ntested     \n  At least 10 trainees have been \nSME loans with a special  trained in SME credit analysis, \nfocus on agriculture are  and present loan applications to \nwell accepted   branch credit committees \n  without external assistance \ncommercially viable   \nmobile service  Branch credit committees are \napproaches to remote  able to make independent SME \nregions are designed and  lending decisions  \ntested   \nAt least 1,000 rural customers \nare served by branchless \nbanking services \n \nActivities with Milestones   Inputs \n1.
