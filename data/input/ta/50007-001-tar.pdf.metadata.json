INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested a policy and advisory \ntechnical  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  during  ADB\u2019s  2015  country \nprogramming mission to enhance the Hunan provincial government\u2019s (HPG) capacity to remediate \ncontaminated farmlands. The technical assistance (TA) project was included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for the PRC.1 ADB fielded a reconnaissance mission to \nBeijing  in  April  2016  and  agreed  with  the  Hunan  Agriculture  Committee  (HAC)  and  other \nstakeholders on the TA project\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nand financing arrangements, as well as the terms of reference for TA consultants.2 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  According to the Survey of National Soil Pollution Status\u2014jointly released in 2014 by the \nMinistry of Environmental Protection and the Ministry of Land and Resources\u201419% of the PRC\u2019s \nfarmlands (an estimated 26 million hectares) is dangerously contaminated. In 2011, excessive \nlevels of the harmful heavy metal cadmium were detected in rice and rice products sold in many \nPRC provinces. Rice from the central province of Hunan was singled out as especially affected.3 \n3.  Hunan Province was earmarked as the major rice producer for the PRC\u2019s large and \ngrowing  population.  However,  large  areas  of  its  once-fertile  farmlands  are  currently \ncontaminated from mining and industrial activities over the past few decades. In 2013, the \nHunan  Provincial  Agricultural  Department  (now  the  HAC)  surveyed  45  counties  within  the \nXiangjiang river basin for heavy metals and collected samples from 1.8 million mu of rice \nproduction area. Survey results indicated that 44% of the 1.8 million mu of rice production areas \nwere  highly  contaminated  with  cadmium  (>0.8  milligram  per  kilogram);  34%  moderately \ncontaminated (0.2\u20130.8 milligram per kilogram); and 22% without contamination detected. The \ngenerally acidic soil conditions in Hunan also increase the rice crops\u2019 absorption of cadmium. \n4.  Cadmium\u2019s effects on human health have been well studied and documented. Academic \npublications and the media in the PRC have reported on cadmium contamination of rice crops \ndue to contaminated farmland.4  \n5.  Hunan has been trying to address soil pollution and farmland contamination. In March \n2011, the State Council approved the Implementation Plan for Heavy Metal Contamination \nRemediation in Xiangjiang River in Hunan Province. From 2011 to 2013, the province took \nmeasures to reduce contamination from industry, including closing, reforming, and improving of \nenvironmental practices at enterprises that have the potential to emit toxic heavy metals.  \n6.  The  PRC  government  issued  the  Soil  Ten  Plan  in  May  2016,  the  most  significant \nmilestone to date in its efforts to combat soil pollution. The plan outlines a comprehensive set of \nactions regarding this issue. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20122018. Manila. \n2  The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 August \n2016. \n3  Z. Chen and Z. Yan. 2016. China's Tainted Soil Initiative Lacks Pay Plan. \n   http://english.caixin.com/2016-06-08/100952896.html.  \n4  In February 2011, the Century Weekly published an article titled \u201cMurder by Cadmium-Contaminated Rice\u201d that \ngained widespread attention. The article reported that a dozen elderly people in a village in Guangxi Province \nsuffered from itai-itai disease because of long-term consumption of rice containing excessive cadmium. These 12 \npeople were unable to walk normally as a result of their illness. Symptoms of itai-itai include severe osteoporosis \nand osteomalacia with simultaneous severe renal dysfunction.  \n ", "2   \n7.  Despite  increasing  priority  and  effort  from  the  central  and  provincial  governments, \nremediating contaminated farmland faces numerous challenges. Key challenges are the lack of \ninnovative and cost-effective technologies, and specific technical guidelines for contaminated \nfarmland remediation.5 Farmland remediation is new to the PRC; capacity and knowledge of \nremediation techniques and practices is also limited and emerging. \n8.  The  absence  of  an  effective  and  efficient monitoring  and  early  warning  system for \nfarmland contamination is another factor that jeopardizes remediation efforts. The absence of a \nlegal and policy framework to deal with farmland contamination is also a stumbling block. Finally, \nthe  lack  of  a  financing  strategy  to  support  contaminated  farmland  remediation  in  Hunan \nProvince also results in the central and provincial governments having to shoulder much of the \ncosts to remediate contaminated farmland.      \n9.  To address some of these key issues, the HPG has requested this TA from ADB. The \nTA  project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  provincial-  and  county-level  administration  for \ncontaminated farmland remediation, management, and monitoring. \n10.  The  TA  project  contributes  to  the  strategic  priorities  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy  2016\u20132020,  which  includes  addressing  environmental  challenges. 6  The  country \npartnership strategy highlights support for environmental management and restoration as a key \ncooperation area with the PRC. A memorandum of understanding signed between ADB and the \nPRC\u2019s Ministry of Environmental Protection in 2014 highlighted soil pollution and contaminated \nland management as an area for continued cooperation. The TA is built on an ADB-financed TA, \nwhich supported the PRC in developing recommendations for a national framework for soil \npollution  and  contaminated  land  management.7 Lessons  from  this  TA  can  potentially  be \nreplicated  in  other  priority  remediation  sites,  not  only  in  the  PRC  but  in  other  developing \nmember countries facing similar challenges. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be improved quality of arable land for rice farming in Hunan Province. \nThe outcome will be enhanced capacity on the part of HPG and local-level administration for \nremediation, monitoring, and management of contaminated farmlands.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA project will have three outputs: (i) technical guidelines, operational standards, \nand recommendations for cost-effective technologies and contaminated farmland remediation \nprojects; (ii) strategies for sustainable financing for remediation activities; and (iii) knowledge of \nkey stakeholders on contaminated farmland remediation. \n \n                                                \n5  The Hunan Environmental Protection Bureau (HEPB) and the Quality and Technical Supervision Bureau jointly \nreleased the \"Standards for Soil Remediation of Heavy Metal Contaminated Sites (DB43/T1165-2016)\" on 29 \nMarch 2016 and became effective on 20 May 2016. The standards mainly focused on remediation of heavily \ncontaminated industrial sites.  \n6  ADB. 2016.
