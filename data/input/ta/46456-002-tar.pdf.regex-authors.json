Capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  secondary  education  and  skills \ndevelopment projects is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations \nbusiness plan for Bangladesh, 2013\u20132015.1 The government has requested the TA to support \nthe management of the Secondary Education Sector Investment Program (SESIP)2 and the \nSkills for Employment Investment Program (SEIP).3 SESIP and SEIP have innovative features. \nSESIP\u2019s  financing  depends  on  achievement  of  selected  results  called  disbursement-linked \nindicators (DLIs). The government and ADB have agreed on detailed criteria and procedures to \nreview and verify achievement of the DLIs. SEIP is expected to develop similar incentives to \nachieve key results. Furthermore, SESIP and SEIP will use the government\u2019s treasury system \nfor disbursement and financial management. To mitigate fiduciary risks associated with having \nthe government manage funds and account for program expenditures, the government and ADB \nhave agreed on a comprehensive fiduciary oversight arrangement for SESIP. They have also \nagreed  on the  implementation  of  an  action  plan  to  improve  practices in  procurement  and \nfinancial management. SEIP is expected to develop similar arrangements to mitigate fiduciary \nrisks. The government and ADB have agreed that the TA for the investment programs will \nspecifically  support  capacity  development  in fiduciary  risk management,  as  well  as  results \nreporting  and  verification.  The  government  concurs  with  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in increasing participation in and completion \nof primary education and participation in secondary education. The major remaining challenges, \nwhich are addressed in the National Education Policy, 2010, are to improve the efficiency and \nquality of education and skills development, and their relevance to labor market needs. The \ngovernment recognizes the need to develop and implement long-term strategies to meet the \ndemand  for  higher-quality  and  more  market-relevant  secondary  education  and  skills \ndevelopment. SESIP and SEIP will support the government\u2019s reform of secondary education \nand skills development into systems that develop a skilled labor force and prepare the youth to \nmeet the requirements of the economy. SESIP aims to achieve three outputs: (i) enhanced \nquality and relevance of secondary education, (ii) expanded equitable access and increased \nretention, and (iii) strengthened management and governance of secondary education. SEIP \naims  to  achieve  four  outputs:  (i)  market-responsive,  inclusive  skills  training;  (ii)  quality \nassurance; (iii) strengthened skills-training institutions; and (iv) effective program management. \n \nA.  Focus on Results \n \n3.  Success in implementing reforms in large systems such as Bangladesh\u2019s education and \nskills development systems depends on agencies\u2019 capacity to plan and manage resources \neffectively to achieve the intended results, and to account for them. Lessons from the Third \nPrimary Education Development Project, which uses DLIs, show that these are powerful tools \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2013\u20132015. Manila. The TA was originally included \nas Human Development Capacity and Implementation Improvement in Bangladesh.  \n2  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Education Sector Investment Program. \nManila. \n3  Scheduled for Board consideration in March 2014. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 August 2013. \n ", "2 \n \nfor shifting attention from inputs to the achievement of essential results that deliver quality \neducation. 5  That  project  demonstrated  that  strengthening  stakeholders\u2019  incentives  and \naccountability for achieving priority results is effective. Consequently, SESIP and SEIP shift the \nemphasis from  a  narrow  approach focused  on  activities  and  inputs  to  a  broader  program \napproach focused on results. SESIP\u2019s financing from 2013 to 2017 depends on the government \nachieving a set of eight annual DLIs that target sector outcomes, intermediate outcomes, and \ninstitutional development, among other results. For instance, the DLI on improving science \nteaching sets a target for increased enrollment rate in science subjects. Achievement of DLIs \nwill be verified through a detailed protocol that includes third-party validation by independent \ninstitutions and individuals, where appropriate. SEIP is expected to develop similar incentives to \nachieve key sector outputs and outcomes.  \n \n4.  Results-based planning and management is still new in secondary education and skills \ndevelopment, so agencies need to develop the capacity to monitor, report, and verify results. \nInstitutional capacity development in monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is essential. SESIP and \nSEIP will help develop agencies\u2019 capacity to carry out results-based planning and management, \nestablish a robust M&E system, and improve monitoring of results. Complementary TA support \nis required to focus on improving capacity in reporting and verification of DLIs and other results. \nThis would help assure the government and ADB on the accuracy of DLI achievement reports. \n \nB.  Use of Country System and Fiduciary Risk Management \n \n5.  The  assessment  undertaken  during  SESIP  preparation  showed  that  Bangladesh\u2019s \nfinancial management has improved. This is because of the reform of the country\u2019s integrated \nbudgeting and accounting system through the Strengthening Public Expenditure Management \nProgram,  which  is  supported  by  development  partners.  The  Third  Primary  Education \nDevelopment Project, which uses the integrated budgeting and accounting system, has also \ncontributed significantly to improving the system. For instance, it introduced new schemes to \ntrack uncleared advances, payment processing time, and monthly reconciliation of accounts. \nThe system is gradually gaining the trust of aid programs, several of which are now willing to \nrely on it. This experience shows that aligning with and helping improve a country\u2019s system can \nyield more positive, sustainable development effects than introducing a parallel system. SESIP \nand SEIP will use the government treasury system for financial management and help improve \npractices in public financial management of secondary education and skills development. Under \nSESIP,  measures  have  been  identified  to  further  mainstream  good  practices  in  financial \nmanagement through better budget execution and financial reporting, and through capacity \ndevelopment  for  the  internal  audit  department  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE).  These \nmeasures have been consolidated in the action plan for procurement and financial management.  \n \n6.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  for  SESIP  showed  that  the  extensive \nprocurement reform under way since 2003 has improved Bangladesh\u2019s procurement laws and \nprocedures. The government recently launched its electronic procurement system, which will \nhelp make procurement more efficient, transparent, and competitive. However, the MOE needs \nto improve procurement practices in the secondary education, and strengthen oversight to \nensure compliance with rules and procedures. Measures to improve procurement practices and \nmitigate  risks  have  been  consolidated  in  the  action  plan  for  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement.  \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Third Primary Education Development Project. Manila. \n \n ", "  3 \n \n7.  The core fiduciary risk is the lack of systematic fiduciary oversight, which weakens \nagencies\u2019 capacity to identify recurring issues and act swiftly on remedial measures. Under \nSESIP, a DLI on fiduciary risk management provides an incentive to develop and implement a \nstructured fiduciary oversight arrangement with three layers: (i) regular oversight by the MOE in \naccordance with government rules and ADB guidelines; (ii) an external audit by the comptroller \nand auditor general; and (iii) an independent annual fiduciary review that includes a post-\nprocurement review, which will be supported by the TA. The recommendations from the annual \nfiduciary review and post-procurement review will be discussed during loan review missions, \nand follow-up actions that are agreed upon will be recorded in the action plan for procurement \nand  financial  management.  These  actions  will  particularly  focus  on  agencies\u2019  institutional \ncapacity development. SEIP will develop similar fiduciary oversight arrangements based on \ncapacity  assessments  of  the  skills  development  agencies.  Capacity  development  in  key \nfiduciary risk areas identified by the annual fiduciary reviews will help strengthen agencies\u2019 \nfiduciary oversight and improve practices in procurement and financial management. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be more efficient and market-relevant systems of secondary \neducation and skills development in Bangladesh, as measured by higher rates of secondary \neducation completion and increased youth employment in the formal sector. The impact of the \nTA is based on the consolidated sector outcome expected at the end of SESIP and SEIP.  \n \n9.  The outcome of the TA will be increased capacity in and assurance about fiduciary \nconcerns and results reporting for SESIP and SEIP. The TA aims to ensure that (i) funds are \nused efficiently and effectively to achieve the intended results and are accounted for, and (ii) \nDLI achievement reports for SESIP and other result reports for SEIP are accurate. Outcomes \nwill be measured through (i) implementation of action  plans for procurement and financial \nmanagement  that  reflect  the  recommendations  from  the  fiduciary  reviews  for  capacity \ndevelopment and (ii) reports that show evidence of achievement of results in accordance with \nthe agreed verification protocols. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The first output is improved capacity in fiduciary risk management. The TA will support \nannual fiduciary reviews, which will examine annual financial statements and conduct in-depth \nreviews of fiduciary risks identified in the action plans or the annual financial statements. These \nrisks may be sector-specific, such as payroll processing, grants to institutions, and delivery of \nstipends  to  students  or  trainees.  They  may  also  be  issues  raised  by  reviews  and  audits \nconducted by the executing agencies and the comptroller and auditor general. The annual \nfiduciary reviews will include post-procurement review of 20% of the contract awards. The \nannual fiduciary reviews will identify key areas of needs for capacity development in fiduciary \nrisk management and practices in procurement and financial management. Recommendations \nof the annual fiduciary reviews will focus on short-term and medium term action plans for \ninstitutional capacity development. These would include national seminars in risk management \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nin sector specific areas for secondary and skills development agencies, and training workshops \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nof local level stakeholders in districts that have weak internal control capacity or have large \nvolume  of  transactions.  Regional  peer  reviews  with  neighboring  countries  with  similar \n ", "4 \n \nexperience  would  also  be  organized  to  promote  knowledge  sharing  in  fiduciary  risk \nmanagement.   \n \n11.  The government and ADB will agree on the updated action plans, which will incorporate \nkey recommendations of the annual fiduciary reviews. In-country workshops will be conducted \nto disseminate the reports of the annual fiduciary reviews. The areas selected for in-depth \nreviews will be confirmed each year during loan review missions. The annual fiduciary reviews, \nincluding the post-procurement reviews, are expected to take place between September and \nDecember.  \n \n12.  The second output is an improved capacity in reporting results and verifying data. The \nTA will help review DLIs and results achievement reports in selected areas. It will follow the DLI \nverification protocol agreed under SESIP and similar arrangements under SEIP. This protocol \nincludes an assessment of administrative and technical documents and data submitted by the \ngovernment,  and  field  verification  of  a  sample.  The  TA  will  identify  areas  that  require \nimprovement in the DLI achievement reports and the data analysis and verification process. It \nwill recommend short-term and medium term action plans for capacity development. In-country \nseminars and training workshops will be organized for agencies staff who are engaged in M&E \nand data management.  \n \n13.  Greater institutional capacity in public financial management and results monitoring, \nreporting, and verification will lead to more efficient use of funds, good governance, and better \naccountability for results. This in turn will lead to better performance. High turnover of staff and \nlack of a conducive political environment for improving system capacity are the risks that may \nundermine the development of institutional capacity. Close oversight by ADB and extensive \npolicy dialogue would help overcome such risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide in-\nkind support, such as counterpart staff and office space. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The  MOE  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  work  in  consultation  with  the  Finance \nDivision of the Ministry of Finance. The MOE will also work with the comptroller general of \naccounts and the comptroller and auditor general, particularly in financial management.  \n \n16.  The TA will be conducted over 24 months from the fielding of the consultants, which is \nanticipated in May 2014; thus the TA is expected to be completed in May 2016.6 The TA will \nengage international consultants for 18 person-months and national consultants for 33 person-\nmonths, for a total of 51 person-months. ADB will recruit an audit firm or an equivalent institution \nto conduct three annual fiduciary reviews, one in 2014 for SESIP and two in 2015 for SESIP and \nSEIP. The firm will be selected using the quality- and cost-based selection method (with the \nstandard quality to cost ratio of 80:20) and simplified technical proposals. The firm will provide \n                                                \n6  Extension and expansion of the TA may be expected, if additional financing from ADB or cofinancing from other \ndevelopment partners becomes available. \n \n ", "  5 \n12  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  24  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services in financial audits and procurement audits, for a total of 36 person-months of \ninputs. In addition, ADB will engage individual international consultants for 4.5 person-months \nand national consultants for 3 person-months to support the verification of DLIs and other \nresults    in  M&E  and  other  technical  areas  such  as  science  education,  information  and \ncommunication technology, decentralization, and skills development. Individual consultants will \nbe engaged for an additional 1.5 person-months of international inputs and 6 person-months of \nnational inputs through a pool of consultants whose areas of expertise will be defined as the \nneed arises in the TA outputs. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. All \nrecruitment will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n17.  SESIP and SEIP will support the transition to a sector-wide approach to secondary \neducation and skills development. Therefore, partnership with and collaborative cofinancing \nfrom other development partners may be expected; possible partners include the World Bank, \nthe Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation, and other bilateral agencies. Joint fiduciary \nreviews may be conducted, if feasible.  \n \n18.  The  TA  will  be  monitored  periodically  through  reviews  of  consultants\u2019  reports  and \nthrough loan review missions for SESIP and SEIP. ADB will evaluate the effectiveness of the TA \nannually and make adjustments, as required, in consultation with government counterparts. \nLessons learned and best practices will be disseminated through the aide-m\u00e9moire of the \nSESIP and SEIP review missions and through selected reports uploaded on the programs\u2019 \nwebsites.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 million on a grant \nbasis  to the  Government  of Bangladesh for  Supporting  Education  and  Skills  Development \nInvestment Programs, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nMore efficient and  Cycle completion rates  Directorate of  The government continues to \nmarket-relevant  (grades 6\u201310) increase  Secondary and  support education and skills \nsecondary education  from 46.4% (F:a 43.6%  Higher Education\u2019s  development programs in line \nand skills development  and madrasah:b 51.6%)  education  with the National Education \nsystems   in 2011 to 58% (F: 55%  management  Policy, 2010 \nfor girls and madrasah:  information system \n62%) in 2023   \n  Bangladesh Bureau \nYouth employment  of Statistics Labor \nincreases to 30% by  Force Survey \n2023 in formal sector \n(baseline:15% in 2010)  \nOutcome      Assumption \nIncreased capacity in  Agreed AFR  Aide-m\u00e9moire of  The government is \nand assurance about  recommendations  SESIP and SEIP  committed to addressing \nfiduciary concerns and  reflected in the updated  review missions  fiduciary risk concerns in \nresults reporting for  action plans are fully    procurement and financial \nSESIP and SEIP  implemented by 2015  Independent  management \nand 2016  verification reports   \n(baseline: initial action  Risk \nplan not updated in  High turnover of staff \n2013)  undermines institutional \n  capacity development \nAnnual DLI and other \n \nresults reports starting \nfrom 2014 fully meet \nagreed DLI verification \nprotocols (baseline: \n2013 protocol \nestablished) \nOutputs        \n1.

General \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will help improve the government\u2019s capacity in managing \nthe Secondary Education Sector Investment Program (SESIP) and the Skills for Employment \nInvestment Program (SEIP), particularly in managing fiduciary risk and in reporting and verifying \nresults.  It  will  assist  in  developing  secondary  education  and  skills  development  agencies \ncapacity in fiduciary oversight, procurement, financial management and results-based planning, \nfinancing, and reporting. The TA will contribute to (i) improved fiduciary oversight and (ii) better \npractices in public financial management and results-based planning, financing, and reporting. \n \nB.  Consultancy Inputs \n \n1.  Capacity Development in Fiduciary Risk Management \n \n2.  The  consultants  will  undertake  an  annual  fiduciary  review  of  SESIP  and  SEIP,  in \naccordance with the terms of reference, which will be finalized every year by the government \nand the Asian Development Bank.1 The consultants will review annual financial statements and \nconduct an in-depth review of fiduciary risks identified each year. These risks may be sector-\nspecific; for example, payroll processing, grants to institutions, and stipends. They may also be \nissues raised by audits conducted by the executing agencies and the supreme audit institution.2 \nThe reviews include post-procurement reviews of 20% of contract awards. Areas for in-depth \nreview will be defined every year and may include \n \n(i)  payment  processing,  including  sample  testing  using  information  from  the \nintegrated budget and accounting system reports and cash books of a sample of \ndrawing and disbursement offices; \n(ii)  reconciliation between the integrated system and the drawing and disbursement \noffices\u2019 cash books and ledgers using system reports on reconciliation, including \nreview of financial management in the offices; \n(iii)  internal controls over payroll processing and personnel data management; \n(iv)  release  procedures  and  financial  management  of  funding  for  schools,  skills-\ntraining institutions, and related cost centers; \n(v)  delivery of stipends;  \n(vi)  review of procurement using international competitive bidding; \n(vii)  analysis of pilot use of electronic procurement; and  \n(viii)  analysis of recurring observations in audits conducted by the executing agencies \nand the supreme audit institution. \n \n3.  Based on the annual fiduciary review findings, the consultants will identify key areas of \nneeds for capacity development in fiduciary risk management and practices in procurement and \nfinancial management. Recommendations of the annual fiduciary reviews will therefore focus on \nshort-term and medium term action plans to develop agencies\u2019 capacity development.
