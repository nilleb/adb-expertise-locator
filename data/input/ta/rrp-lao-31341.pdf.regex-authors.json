Reinforcement and extension of the \n115-kilovolt (kV) transmission line and substation facilities will also \nimprove  service  to  industrial  and  commercial  consumers  and \nreduce system losses. \n   \nRationale  The Lao PDR is one of the least developed countries in Southeast \nAsia. As 80% of the country\u2019s population is rural, rural development \nis needed to reduce poverty. Bringing electricity to rural areas, \nespecially poor villages, is key to promoting rural development. \nDespite the country\u2019s comparative advantage in producing power \nand the low cost of production, low population density makes initial \ncapital investments in rural electrification expensive. The Lao PDR \nthus has one of the lowest electrification rates in the region, which \nhinders the country\u2019s ability to attract investments and to develop \nrural areas. The Project will electrify 342 villages and towns, and \ndirectly  benefit  poor  households  (about  43%  of  the  total  rural \npopulation).  These  households  will  substantially  reduce  their \nexpenditure on energy, and improve their income and quality of life. \nThe indirect benefits include improved health and education and \nother benefits from rural development. Access to reliable and good \nelectricity services will improve the ability of the rural population to \ngenerate economic growth and better benefit from it. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The  project  objectives  are  to  (i)  extend  the  transmission  and \ndistribution system in northern rural areas to provide  electricity to \nrural low-income communities, and to improve their living standards \nand economic condition; and (ii) help the Government restructure \nthe power sector, and strengthen Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) project \nmanagement capacity and operational efficiency. The Project scope \nincludes (i) reinforcement and extension of the high-voltage (115 \nkV) power grid; (ii) construction of associated medium- (34.5/22 kV) \nand  low-voltage  (400  volts  [V])  distribution  systems;  and  (iii) \nprovision  of  consulting  services  to  help  EdL  in  detailed  project \ndesign,  implementation  supervision,  and  other  capacity  building \nactivities.  \n   \n ", "iv \nCost Estimates  The Project is estimated to cost $51.51 million, including $35.90 \nmillion in foreign exchange costs and $15.61 million equivalent in \nlocal currency costs. \n \nFinancing Plan   \n          ($ million)\nSource    Foreign  Local  Total  % \n  Exchange  Currency \nAsian Development \nBank     26.60  3.40  30.00  58.2 \nNordic Development \nFund     9.30  0.70  10.00  19.5 \nGovernment/Electricit\u00e9  \ndu Laos    0.0  11.51  11.51  22.3 \nTotal  35.90  15.61  51.51  100.0 \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $30 million equivalent from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Special Funds resources will be provided.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Northern  Area  Rural  Power \nDistribution Project. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In line with the power sector policy to expand affordable, reliable, and sustainable \nelectricity supply to promote economic and social development, the Government has requested \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help develop transmission and distribution facilities and \nrural electrification in the northern area. This report is based on the findings of the Loan \nAppraisal Mission and discussions with government  agencies. The project framework is in \nAppendix 1. \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  The power sector is organized under the Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts (MIH), \nwhose  main  duties  include  preparing  power  sector  development  plans  and  regulations, \nrecommending tariff levels to the Government, and administering and inspecting electricity \nenterprises. Under MIH is Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL), a wholly state-owned public enterprise, \nwhich owns and operates the country\u2019s main generation, transmission, and distribution assets \nand manages electricity imports and exports. The organization structure of EdL is in Appendix 2. \n4.  The Lao PDR is one of the least developed countries in Southeast Asia. As 80% of the \npopulation lives in rural areas, these need to be developed to reduce poverty. Increasing access \nto electricity in rural areas, especially poor villages, is key to their development. Despite the \ncountry\u2019s comparative advantage in producing power and the low cost of production, low \npopulation density makes initial capital investments in rural electrification expensive. The Lao \nPDR thus has one of the lowest electrification rates in the region, which hinders the country\u2019s \nability to attract investments and develop rural areas.  \n5.  Only about 20% of all villages and 34% of households have electricity. The country has \nno fully integrated national grid. The power system covers four regions and serves about \n250,000 customers. In the northern region, with 18% of the total population, only about 14% of \nvillages have access to electricity. Rural households and communities with no access to the grid \neither have no electricity supply or rely on more expensive and limited off-grid power supply, \nwhich stunts the growth of agriculture, services, and industry.  \n6.  Despite overall reduction of poverty due to significant  economic growth during the \n1990s, poverty was only marginally reduced in the northern region, the country\u2019s poorest, where \nover 52% of the population is poor.1 With only basic infrastructure, the region has not benefited \nfrom economic growth as much as other regions. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Continued  economic  growth  is  needed  to  reduce  poverty  and  achieve  social \ndevelopment. Although the country has development potential, particularly in land and water \nresources, it is constrained by (i) the land-locked nature of the country; (ii) shortage of skilled \n                                                 \n1  Lao National Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2 1997/98. \n ", "2 \nhuman resources; (iii) weak institutional capabilities; and (iv) limited transport, power, and \ncommunication infrastructure serving the small and widely dispersed population. \n8.  The Government gives priority to power sector development to achieve macroeconomic, \nmicroeconomic, and social goals. The power sector policy2 is to maintain and expand low-cost, \nreliable, and sustainable electricity, increase the national electrification ratio as quickly as \npossible, and bring electricity to all by expanding and improving the main grid. If more cost-\neffective than grid extension, off-grid electrification in remote and isolated areas will also be \nencouraged.3 \n9.  EdL is extending the main grid, preferring projects that accelerate social and economic \ndevelopment  and  reduce  rural  poverty.  To  achieve  the  government  target  of  raising  the \nelectrification ratio from 34% to 70% by 2010, EdL intends to supply electricity to 270,000 \nhouseholds with road access, mostly in rural areas. A detailed analysis of the power sector is in \nAppendix 3. \n10.  ADB has been the largest source of assistance to the power sector in Lao PDR, helping \nexport hydropower and meet local electricity demand by providing over $230 million in loans \nand technical assistance (TA) by the end of 2002 (Appendix 4). Of the eight completed power \nprojects, six were rated successful and the other two, partly successful.4 The sector should be \nmade  sustainable  and  able  to  deal  with  social  and  environmental  concerns  and  contract \nmanagement.  Low  domestic  retail  tariffs  and  EdL\u2019s  poor  financial  performance  impede \nsustainable power expansion. The Government needs to set tariffs based on marginal-cost \npricing, progressively remove heavy subsidies to domestic consumers, and discourage waste. \nOnce electricity becomes available, the upper middle-class and wealthy households are the first \nto adopt it. If a project, however, also introduces reasonable and affordable up-front charges \nand  lifeline  tariffs,  even  poor  households  pay  for  electricity.  The  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment addressed these issues (paras. 21\u201332), taking into account experience gained. \n11.  The most recently completed project performance audit report for the Nam Ngum-\nLouang Phrabang Power Transmission highlights a number of lessons, which, along with follow-\nup actions, were incorporated into project design: (i) monthly tariff adjustment is suitable to raise \ntariffs  to  acceptable  and  viable  levels  without  causing  undue  consumer  resistance;  (ii) \ntransmission projects that carry electricity across populated rural areas should also distribute \nelectricity to them to minimize objections from affected communities; and (iii) more rigorous \nchecks  are  needed  at  commissioning  so  that  faulty  equipment  does  not  impair  technical \noperations. \n12.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program5 for the Lao PDR aims to promote sustainable \neconomic growth and development through infrastructure investments. Specifically, ADB will \ncontinue to help the power sector, emphasizing rural electrification. As most of the poor live in \nrural areas and most people depend on agriculture to live, rural development is critical to \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Widespread  rural  electrification  will \nimprove  productivity,  consumer  demand,  and  economic  opportunities.  Internationally,  rural \nelectrification  alone  has  not  triggered  industrial  development  and  economic  growth:  other \n                                                 \n2   Power Sector Policy Statement, Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts, March 2001 (Supplementary Appendix A). \n3   In general, off-grid electrification is a viable alternative for communities too far from distribution networks to be \neconomically served from the grid. A number of demonstration projects on off-grid electrification are ongoing with \nhelp from the World Bank,  Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and United Nations Development \nProgramme/Global Environmental Facility (UNDP/GEF) funds.  \n4   The two partly successful projects are (i) Vientiane Power Distribution, which had cost overruns following civil \nunrest in the mid-1970s; and (ii) Nam Ngum-Louang Phrabang Power Transmission, which also had cost overruns \ndue to high inflation and the deteriorating exchange rate. \n5   ADB. 2002. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic Country Strategy and Program Update (2003-2005). Manila. \n ", "3 \ninfrastructure  such  as  roads  and  improved  irrigation  must  be  available  or  developed \nsimultaneously. The Government has thus agreed that ADB\u2019s assistance will focus on the \npoorest  northern  provinces.6  Such  an  integrated  approach  will  reinforce  projects,  thereby \nmaximizing efforts to reduce poverty and develop the economy. As ADB has approved a loan7 \nto finance the Northern Economic Corridor Project, which will link the Lao PDR to neighboring \nThailand and People\u2019s Republic of China, which are rapidly growing economies, the northern \nregion can expect an economic boom. The proposed Project will directly complement ADB\u2019s \nefforts, promote socioeconomic development, and reduce poverty. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n13.  ADB is helping EdL build a backbone high-voltage transmission network through the \nPower Transmission and Distribution (PTD) Project.8 By project completion in September 2003, \nthese  backbone  lines  will  permit  further  high-voltage  extension  of  the  northern  grid while \nsubstations will enable expanded coverage at 22.0-kilovolt (kV) or 34.5 kV distribution levels.  \n14.  The proposed Project is designed to maximize the benefit of previous investment in \ntransmission and distribution facilities and further extend the distribution network. The feasibility \nstudy  completed  in  September  2002  covers  potential  project  areas  in  Xieng  Khouang, \nPhongsali,  Louang  Namtha,  Oudomxai,  Louang  Phrabang,  and  Sayaburi  provinces,  and \nXaisomboun Special Region, which are due to receive special development assistance as they \nare the poorest parts of the country. \n15.  The distribution work should not be started all at the same time. During the Fact-Finding \nMission the Government and ADB agreed to divide the northern area rural electrification into \nthree phases. The proposed Project is phase one and will intensify electrification in areas near \nthe backbone 115 kV transmission lines being constructed under the PTD Project to maximize \nfinancial and socioeconomic benefits. ADB has also committed to other infrastructure projects in \nareas with the highest poverty incidence and potential for economic development.9 Project \nareas include districts in Xieng Khouang, Sayaburi, Oudomxai, and Louang Namtha provinces, \nand Xaisomboun Special Region (see project map). Areas not covered under the Project will be \nelectrified in the follow-on phases. This Project and the follow-on projects were included in \nEdL\u2019s updated Power Development Plan (2002-2011).  \n16.  The Project\u2019s objectives are  to (i) extend the transmission and distribution system in \nnorthern areas to provide electricity to rural low-income communities, and improve their living \nstandards and local economic conditions; and (ii) help the Government restructure the power \nsector, and strengthen EdL\u2019s project management capacity and operational efficiency. \n                                                 \n6   Including Phongsali, Louang Namtha, Oudomxai, Bokeo, Louang Phrabang, Houaphanh, Sayaburi, and Xieng \nKhouang provinces. \n7  ADB. 2002.

The network facilities consist of 115 kV lines from Nam \nLeuk to Xieng Khouang, Xieng Ngeun to Sayaburi, and Thalat to Muang Feuang, and 115/22 kV substations at \nthe end of each line. \n9   Including the Northern Economic Corridor, Rural Access Roads, Northern Community Managed Irrigation, and \nNorthern and Central Water Supply and Sanitation projects. \n ", "4 \n17.  The Project will reinforce and extend the existing high-voltage transmission lines (115 \nkV) and construct associated medium- (34.5/22 kV) and low-voltage (400-volt [V]) distribution \nsystems in the northern area. Reinforcement and extension of the 115 kV transmission lines \nand substation facilities will improve service to industry and commerce. New transmission and \ndistribution facilities will  increase the capacity of transmission lines, substations, and shunt \ncapacitors, and thus lessen system losses. \nB.  Components and Outputs \n18.  Grid extension and distribution facilities will be developed along main and branch roads. \nRoad access ensures that grid extension is technically possible and economically beneficial. All \nvillages along the main roads or up to 10 kilometers (km) from the transmission line are the \nprincipal  candidates  for  electrification.  The  power  demand  forecast  projected  residential \nconsumption based on an inventory of appliances by house size and the assumed intensity of \ntheir  use.  Projected  nonresidential  consumption  in  villages  gave  allowance  for  schools, \nhospitals, markets, rice milling, guest houses, community water supply systems, and some large \nindustry users.10 Most targeted customers will be households in economically viable population \ncenters and rural villages with road access. Total projected energy sales from the project areas \nare estimated at 8% of EdL\u2019s projected domestic turnover in 2010. Given the limited increase of \npower demand in rural areas and adequate power surplus in the Lao PDR, power generation \nsources will be sufficient for power supply in project areas.11 \n19.  The Project will electrify 342 villages and towns, directly benefiting 33,800 households. \nThese households will substantially reduce their expenditure on energy, and improve their \nincome and quality of life. The indirect benefits include improved health and education and other \nbenefits from rural development. Access to reliable and good electricity services will improve the \nability of the rural population to generate economic growth and better benefit from it. The Project \nwill lift barriers to access and lay the foundation for future poverty targeting of electricity access \nbeyond the project areas (paras. 26-28). \n20.  The project components were developed following technical, economic, and financial \nstudies that consider environmental and social aspects. The feasibility study compared various \nways of extending rural electrification, including on- and off-grid options, and concluded that grid \nextension was the most cost-effective and would generate acceptable economic returns.12 The \nspecific construction quantities will be revised after detailed design during implementation. \nSpecifically, the Project will consist of the following components: \n(i)  extension of high-voltage (115 kV) transmission lines totaling 303 km, including a \n173  km  line  from  Louang  Phrabang  to  Oudomxai,  and  a  79  km  line  from \nOudomxai to Louang Namtha, a 46 km line from Hin Heup to Vang Vieng, and a \n5 km line from Nam Ngum to Thalat; \n \n(ii)  construction of 115, 34.5, and 22 kV substations at Oudomxai, Louang Namtha, \nand Louang Phrabang (extension); \u201cT\u201d tap junction13 at Hin Heup substation; \n                                                 \n10  Under the feasibility study as well as the Fact-Finding Mission\u2019s field survey, a number of large industrial users \nsuch as cement plants, a sawmill, and a garment factory were operating or would be developed. \n11  By completion, total increased demand on annual energy in the project areas is estimated at 46,000 MWh/year. \nDetailed power supply and demand balances for the country and regions show that the increased demand up to \n2020 could be met by increasing power supply sources. \n12  As an optimal design, the conventional 22 kV, three-phase, three-wire distribution system is employed for high-\ndensity town centers or villages, while the 34.5 kV, three-phase, two-shield wire, earth return shield-wire system is \nthe least-cost solution to electrify low-density service areas with small loads. \n13  A \u201cT\u201d-shaped junction where a new transmission line is connected to an existing line to tap power supply. \n ", "5 \n\u201cInterface\u201d at Sayaburi and Phonsavanh substations; and some minor extension \nwork at Vang Vieng, Thalat, and Nam Ngum substations; \n \n(iii)  erection  of  796  km  of  medium-voltage  (34.5/22  kV)  distribution  lines,  237 \ndistribution transformers, and 609 km of low-voltage (380 V) distribution lines; \nand connection of 33,800 households in 342 villages;  \n \n(iv)  clearance of unexploded ordnance (UXO) in project areas; \n \n(v)  miscellaneous  works,  including  benefit  monitoring,  resettlement,  and \ncompensation programs; \n \n(vi)  consulting  services  to  help  EdL  in  detailed  project  design,  implementation \nsupervision, and other capacity-building support; and \n \n(vii)  consulting services to the Government to further study the separation of its \nexisting shareholdings and future independent power producer (IPP) investments \nfrom  EdL,  and  development  of  IPP  project  selection  and  implementation \nprocedures. \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Financial Recovery Program \n21.  EdL\u2019s  financial  performance  since  1997  has  been  significantly  affected  by  the \ndepreciation of the kip. As EdL borrows almost all its debt in foreign currency, the depreciation \nof the kip has prevented it from meeting its financial ratios (Appendix 5). With the help of ADB \nand the World Bank, the Government and EdL have made great efforts to improve EdL\u2019s \nfinancial  performance.  In  late  1999  the  Government  approved  a  comprehensive  financial \nrecovery program (FRP) for EdL to restore its financial viability and improve its internal cash-\ngenerating capacity to meet future investment needs. \n22.  Specific financial recovery measures include the following: (i) increase retail electricity \ntariffs starting in May 2002 for all consumer classes by approximately 2.3% per month through \nApril 2005; (ii) convert some EdL debt into government equity; (iii) retain dividends from EdL\u2019s \nsubsidiary  companies;  (iv)  revaluate  EdL\u2019s  fixed  assets  in  service;  (v)  temporarily  relax \nrepayment terms of subsidiary loan agreements; (vi) review EdL\u2019s capital expenditure program \nto ensure EdL\u2019s financial viability in meeting the Government\u2019s electrification targets; and (vii) \nimplement  EdL\u2019s  performance  contract  with  the  Government,  which  includes  eliminating \npayment arrears from government agencies. The Government agreed to offset its arrears and \ncurrent  consumption  against  EdL\u2019s  tax  and  other  financial  liabilities.  In  May  2003  the \nGovernment confirmed that the first offsetting payment had been made, and ADB and the \nGovernment agreed on a schedule of consecutive quarterly offsets in 2004 and 2005 to fully \nsettle the arrears. Completion of the FRP and other beneficial transactions in 200214 has helped \nEdL recover from its financial crisis and become more stable. EdL operations should be \nprofitable and sustainable for the next several years. However, EdL faces some risks as it \nattempts to balance its capital expansion plans (including rural electrification projects on behalf \nof the Government) with its financial performance as a commercial organization. ADB will \n                                                 \n14  The proceeds from refinancing of the Theun Hinboun Hydropower Project were applied to outstanding liabilities \nwith the Government. \n ", "6 \ncontinue to monitor EdL\u2019s financial recovery and help in future planning to ensure that EdL \nremains properly capitalized. \n2.  Implementation of the Power Sector Strategy  \n23.  In the last several years, ADB has focused its policy dialogue efforts on financial \nrestructuring and revisions of EdL\u2019s tariff structure, which has allowed EdL to recover from the \n1997  financial crisis and move to full loan covenant compliance. Recently, ADB has also \nengaged MIH and EdL in institutional and sector restructuring. Under an ADB TA,15 the Power \nSector Strategy Study (PSSS) was completed in September 2002, reviewing overall sector \ndevelopment and policies. Key policy recommendations include (i) developing a more rigorous \nleast-cost hydropower development plan and selection process and accordingly updating EdL\u2019s \nPower  Development  Plan;  (ii)  segregating  non-core  operations  such  as  off-grid  rural \nelectrification  and  IPP  investment  functions,  allowing  EdL  to  concentrate  on  power  grid \noperation and development; (iii) reevaluating the role of the Government in the power sector as \nan operator, investor, and regulator; and (iv) establishing a procedure for competitive tendering \nof  future  generation  projects.  These  recommendations  focus  on  long-term  development \nstrategies  and  will  guide  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government.  Further  work  on \ncoordination with the World Bank to jointly implement those strategies is ongoing. \n24.  Based on the findings of the PSSS and a workshop16 on options for power sector reform, \nthe  Government  has  approved  a  sector-strengthening  strategy,  including  a  time-bound \nimplementation plan in June 2003, and began implementing it thereafter. \n25.  The Government prioritizes power generation for export to raise revenue. The Electricity \nLaw  gives  EdL  the  mandate  to  ensure  domestic  power  supply  through  development  and \noperation  of  domestic  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  However,  EdL  has  been \ndistracted from financially managing its core operations as it is the Government\u2019s shareholder \nfor IPP projects. EdL uses dividends from IPP investments to cross-subsidize core operations \nand meet loan covenants. EdL has also unintentionally reduced the direct financial benefits that \nthe Government receives from IPP. Although the Government\u2019s Power Sector Policy Statement \nand  studies  support  the  establishment  of  a  wholly  government-owned  IPP  shareholding \ncompany to assume ownership of shares held by EdL, a detailed implementation framework to \nestablish and operate this company needs further study and stakeholder consultation. The \nGovernment and ADB have agreed to study IPP project selection criteria and introduce clear \nIPP project implementation procedures (para. 41). \n3.  Connections for the Poor \n26.  The Project addresses two key barriers that prevent the poor from accessing electricity \nservices from the grid. The first is the policy of cost sharing, where the village contributes 30% \nof low-voltage distribution costs, and thus disproportionately burdens the poorer and more \nremote villages and may deter villages from connecting entirely. MIH recognized the inequity \nand, to provide affordable electricity services to the poor, has abolished the policy of cost \nsharing.  \n27.  The second barrier was the up-front connection charges paid by individual households. \nPoor households may find the charges too steep to pay in one lump sum. The Fact-Finding \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Lao PDR for the Power Sector Strategy Study. Manila. \n16  Vientiane, November 2002. \n ", "7 \nMission\u2019s findings confirm that poor households in electrified villages are either not connected or \nconnect  through  shared  (illegal)  connections,  which  are  paid  for  at  a  flat  rate  and  thus \nsubstantially more expensive per kWh than direct connections. This also implies that electricity \nsubsidies are not reaching the poor but, in effect, benefiting the nonpoor.  \n28.  EdL  has  agreed  to  allow  residential  consumers  connecting  to  3/9-ampere  meter \nconnections, and all new residential consumers, and not just those under ADB projects, to \namortize the initial up-front costs over up to 12 months. Charges for wiring from the pole and \nworks on inside house wiring will be left entirely to the private sector to promote small-scale \nrural  enterprise.  The  private  sector  is  expected  to  provide  credit  on  the  work  to  secure \ncustomers. However, EdL will carefully monitor connections under the Project as part of benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation, and require revision of credit provision if needed. The number of \nconnected poor, compared to the anticipated number, will be reported in quarterly reports to \nADB as part of project performance monitoring. \n4.  Loss Reduction on Distribution System \n29.  EdL\u2019s distribution losses were relatively high during the past 5 years at around 20%. The \nloss reduction program under the PTD Project identified a number of factors contributing to \nEdL\u2019s technical and nontechnical distribution losses, and recommended ways to reduce them. \nEdL established a loss reduction unit (LRU) to record and analyze distribution losses. Staff in all \nmain field branches are trained regularly in loss reduction. Through consultant services, the \nProject will help EdL implement recommendations for loss reduction. \n30.  EdL  will  implement  these  recommendations  under  its  own  budget,  including \nimprovement of its billing system, upgrading low- and medium-voltage distribution conductors, \ncalibrating and replacing inaccurate meters in substations, and installing new capacitors. EdL is \ncommitted to reduce total domestic distribution loss17 to less than 17% by the end of 2003, 16% \nby 2004, and 15% by 2005, and maintain these levels thereafter. The Project will help EdL \nreduce losses, and the consultant engaged will provide technical supervision and training for \nEdL  staff,  particularly  at  EdL  branch  offices,  to  continually  improve  EdL\u2019s  operational \nperformance.  EdL  will  submit  to  ADB  annual  progress  reports  on  LRU  operations  and \nmanagement, and statistics of total system losses. \n5.  Capacity Building \n31.  EdL  has  successfully  implemented  seven  ADB-assisted  projects.  Its  overall \nperformance, including that for projects financed by other lending agencies, is satisfactory. \nEdL\u2019s institutional capacity has been strengthened substantially. However, capacity weaknesses \nstill exist, particularly in the design and operation of high-voltage transmission and distribution \nfacilities, financial management, social and environmental management, contract management, \nand benefit and evaluation monitoring. The Project will complement ADB\u2019s previous efforts and \nfurther strengthen EdL\u2019s capacity in these areas through consultant services in coordination with \nother funding agencies support. The consultants will (i) train EdL staff in bid evaluation, contract \nawarding,  supervision  of  construction  work,  and  system  testing  and  commissioning;  (ii) \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  staff  in  main  field  offices  through  regular  training  seminars, \ndissemination of technical standards, and implementation of the computerized management \n                                                 \n17 Domestic distribution losses are defined as the difference between (i) gross energy (gigawatt-hours [GWh]) sent \nout from the 115 kV substation, and (ii) electricity (GWh) billed to all consumers and expressed as a percentage of \ngross energy. \n ", "8 \ninformation system; and (iii) help improve social and environmental assessment, management, \nand monitoring of projects. \n32.  The Project will also provide capacity building in consumer services through a consumer \nawareness program, which will include information on safe use of electricity, connection cost \npolicy, tariffs, billing statements and timing of bills, and due payment and disconnection policy. \nThe program design will take into account the difficulties of language barriers. The Project will \nhelp  build  sustainable  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  feed  into  project  design  and \nevaluation (para. 46). \nD.  Cost Estimates \n33.  The total project cost is estimated at $51.51 million equivalent, comprising $35.90 million \nequivalent  (70%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $15.61  million  equivalent  (30%)  in  local \ncurrency cost. The cost estimates are based on 2003 price levels for base costs, and include \nphysical contingencies, price contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest charges during \nconstruction. Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10% of base costs, and price \ncontingencies were calculated using ADB\u2019s current rates of inflation.  The cost estimates are \nsummarized in Table 1 and details in Appendix 6. \nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

ADB will provide a $30-million loan from its Special Funds resources to finance 58.2% of \nthe total project cost. The loan will finance $26.6 million of the Project\u2019s foreign exchange cost, \nincluding interest during construction on the loan to the Government. The loan will also finance \n$3.4 million equivalent of the Project\u2019s local costs. The proportion of local currency funding \n ", "9 \nproposed under this loan is justified by the nature of the Project, particularly its focus on poverty \nreduction, electrification of rural areas, and  fiscal condition of the Government. The Nordic \nDevelopment Fund (NDF) will provide parallel cofinancing of  \u20ac10 million (approximately $10 \nmillion equivalent) for the substation package and project implementation consulting services, \nrepresenting 19.5% of total project cost.18 EdL will fund $11.5 million of local costs (representing \n22.3% of total project cost) from its internally generated funds. The proposed financing plan is in \nTable 2. \n35.  The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including an 8-year grace period, with an \ninterest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% during principal amortization and on \nother terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. The borrower will be \nthe Lao PDR, and the proceeds of the loan will be re-lent to EdL pursuant to a subsidiary loan \nagreement with terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. The borrower will re-lend the ADB \nloan to EdL for 20 years maturity, including a 5-year grace period, at interest rates consistent \nwith the re-lending terms included in the government-approved FRP (3.0% interest in 2004-\n2005, 6.0% interest in 2006 and thereafter). The Government will re-lend NDF\u2019s loan to EdL on \nthe same terms. EdL agreed to bear the Government\u2019s foreign exchange risk of the proposed \nloans, as EdL\u2019s foreign currency earnings from export sales of electricity should mitigate this \nrisk. \nTable 2: Proposed Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nShare \n  Foreign  Share of  Local  Share of     of   \nSource \nCurrency  Total  Currency  Total  Total \n  (%)  (%)  Total  (%) \n                      \nAsian Development Bank Loan    26.60  51.6  3.40  6.6  30.00  58.2 \nNordic Development Fund Loan    9.30  18.1  0.70  1.4  10.00  19.5 \nGovernment/Electricit\u00e9 du Lao  \n0.00  0.0  11.51  22.3  11.51  22.3 \nCounterpart Funding   \n  Total    35.90  69.7  15.61  30.3  51.51  100.0 \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n36.  EdL  will  be  the  Project\u2019s  executing  agency.  The  EdL  general  manager  will  be \nresponsible for overall project management. The project management unit (PMU) headed by the \nproject manager was established at EdL on 18 March 2003.19 Supervised by the Development \nDepartment deputy general manager, the PMU will be responsible for all aspects of project \nimplementation: (i) overall project implementation planning, budgeting, finance planning, and \naccounting; (ii) recruitment of consultants; (iii) supervision and coordination of detailed project \ndesign;  (iv)  procurement  of  goods  and  services;  (v)  implementation,  supervision,  and \n                                                 \n18  The NDF board had approved the loan proposal on the cofinancing arrangement for the Project in May 2003. The \nNDF loan will be denominated in euros and have a maturity of 40 years, with a 10-year grace period, 0.75% \nservice charge, and 0.50% commitment fee. NDF will administer its own loan portion, including the relevant \nprocurement and disbursement. \n19  The PMU consists of the project manager, project accountant, procurement specialist, and project engineer. \n ", "10 \ncommissioning  of  all  project  components;  (vi)  organization  of  the  project  performance \nmonitoring system; and (vii) preparation of periodic progress reports and the project completion \nreport. A team of international consultants will help the PMU in its day-to-day operations. \nConsultant services and construction work will be carried out under contracts administered by \nEdL.  It  will  establish  a  permanent  socioeconomic  cell  by  the  end  of  2003  under  the \nEnvironmental and Social Management Office. \n2.  Implementation Period \n37.  The Project will be implemented over 4.5 years beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003. \nPhysical works are expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2008, with loan closing in \nSeptember 2008 (6 months following completion of works). The 4.5-year implementation period \nis considered appropriate, given the large number of project components, distances of the \nproject sites, and the difficult terrain. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n3.  Procurement \n38.  Procurement of goods and services to be financed from the proposed ADB loan will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. International competitive \nbidding procedures will be used for major civil works contracts estimated to cost over $1 million, \nand supply contracts valued over $500,000. For civil works contracts not exceeding $1 million, \nlocal competitive bidding procedures will be used. The Government\u2019s procurement guidelines \n(Implementing Rules and Regulations on Government Procurement of Goods, Construction, \nRepairs  and  Services,  December  1988),  prepared  under  an  ADB  TA,  are  considered \nsatisfactory for this. For supply contracts valued at $500,000 or below, international shopping \nprocedures will be followed. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 8. \n4.  Consulting Services \n39.  Considering  EdL\u2019s  limited  project  management  capacity  and  technical  expertise, \napproximately 110 person-months of international and 20 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices will be required to support project implementation and capacity building. Consultants \nwill focus on supervising and guiding project implementation and EdL staff training, while the \nPMU will be responsible for project implementation. The consultant team, including experts on \ntransmission, substation, distribution, environmental and socioeconomic survey, assessment \nand monitoring, will help EdL (i) conduct detailed project design; (ii) procure goods and services; \n(iii) supervise installation and construction; (iv) final system test and commission; (v) oversee \nquality assurance on UXO detection and clearance; (vi) provide technical support for distribution \nmanagement  and  loss  reduction;  (vii)  conduct  social  and  environmental  assessment, \nmanagement, and monitoring; (viii) build capacity for social and environmental assessment, \nmanagement, and monitoring; (ix) undertake project performance monitoring and evaluation; \nand (x) conduct a consumer awareness campaign. \n40.  Project implementation consultant services will be entirely financed from the proposed \nNDF  loan.  EdL  will  recruit  consultants  in  accordance  with  NDF\u2019s  General  Procurement \nGuidelines (to be attached to NDF\u2019s credit agreement) based on Nordic competitive bidding, \nand in full consultation with ADB. The general procurement principles and documents will follow \nand be based on ADB\u2019s practice and  guidelines. The terms of reference (TOR) for project \nimplementation consulting services are in Appendix 9. \n ", "11 \n41.  Around 13 person-months of separate consulting services will be required to help the \nGovernment strengthen the power sector. EdL will closely coordinate with the Committee for \nPlanning and Cooperation, MIH, and other agencies. These consulting services will be financed \nfrom  the  ADB  loan  and  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.20 The major tasks include (i) develop transparent IPP project selection criteria and \nintroduce  clear  IPP  project  implementation  procedures,  and  (ii)  identify  and  structure  an \nappropriate  government  agency  to  assume  ownership  of  the  Government\u2019s  existing  IPP \nshareholdings and future IPP equity investments. The TOR for these consulting services are in \nAppendix 10. \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n42.  For ADB loan funds, all standard disbursement procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001) will be used. Disbursements will be for supply \nand installation of power distribution and transmission equipment and accessories. Considering \nEdL\u2019s adequate cash-flow capacity, the Government and EdL agreed that an imprest account \nwould not be required. However, to facilitate disbursement processing, statement of expenditure \nwill be used, with a ceiling of $50,000.  \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n43.  EdL will maintain separate accounts for the proposed Project and submit to ADB within 9 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year audited annual project accounts describing in detail fund \nsources and expenditures. EdL will also submit within 9 months after the end of the fiscal year \naudited annual financial statements. \n44.  Unless otherwise agreed in advance by ADB, EdL will continue to hire external auditors \nfor its annual financial statements and annual project accounts, and the audit report together \nwith the memorandum on issues identified during the audit will be attached to these reports. For \nfuture contracts and revisions, ADB will approve the auditors\u2019 TOR before work starts. While the \naccounts  will  be  prepared  using  Lao  accounting  standards,  the  audit  will  be  done  using \ninternational  standards  of  auditing.  The  auditors  will  provide  detailed  comments  on  any \ndivergence  from  such  standards,  provide  opinions  on  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial \ncovenants, and indicate the details of the actual calculation for all ratios, in conformity with the \ndefinitions contained in the loan and project agreements.  \n45.  Regular progress reports for the proposed Project will be prepared by the PMU and \nsubmitted  quarterly  to  ADB  and  NDF.  The  reports  will  describe  the  physical  progress, \nprocurement  and  contractual  status,  highlights  of  implementation  issues,  total  number  of \nconsumers connected, and a summary of project components, with details of the latest project \ndisbursements of incremental expenditures and contract amounts. A project completion report \nwill be submitted to ADB and NDF within 3 months after project completion. Aside from \nassessing project execution and operation, the report will indicate compliance with the loan \ncovenants. \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n46.  EdL will ensure that a comprehensive program for project performance monitoring and \nevaluation (PPME) acceptable to ADB will be carried out during implementation and subsequent \n                                                 \n20 The selection of consultants will employ the quality- and cost-based selection method, involving the simultaneous \nsubmission of technical and financial proposals and the use of price as an evaluation criterion. \n ", "12 \noperation to assess the achievement of the Project\u2019s objectives. The PPME will be based on the \nproject framework in Appendix 2, including monitoring and evaluation of the project physical \nprogress, operations, and project benefits and impacts. With help from the consultants and in \nconsultation with local communities, the PMU will develop a set of PPME indicators at the start \nof  the  Project.  The  PMU  will  carry  out  the  PPME,  including  initial  baseline  physical  and \nsocioeconomic surveys, data collection, and analysis. To set a benchmark to monitor and \nevaluate social and economic benefits, a baseline socioeconomic survey will be carried out \nbefore connections are made in project areas. A second socioeconomic survey will be carried \nout 3 years after the first connections to evaluate project effectiveness in targeting the poor and \nenhancing the welfare of households and communities. The surveys will cover electrified and \nunelectrified areas. The new connection policy will be assessed continuously throughout the \nProject.  EdL  will  submit  a  detailed  PPME  implementation  plan  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and \nconcurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness, as well as annual PPME reports. \n8.  Project Review \n47.  A project inception mission will be fielded soon after approval of the proposed loan. ADB \nwill also conduct regular reviews (at least twice annually) throughout project implementation. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  agree  on  measures  to  remove  any  hurdles  to  project \nimplementation and to meet project objectives. The Government, ADB, and NDF will jointly \nundertake a detailed midterm review of the Project after 2 years of implementation, or earlier if \nmajor difficulties threaten the project objectives. The midterm review will appraise the project \nscope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, number of connections, and compliance \nwith  loan  covenants;  and  identify  issues  to  be  resolved  to  improve  project  impact  and \nsustainability. The Government, ADB, and NDF will jointly decide on any changes needed in \nproject design and implementation. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n1.  Economic Analysis \n48.  Most  households  have  no  access  to  grid  electricity.  However,  province-sponsored \nsystems and privately operated diesel-run generators or small hydro systems and imports from \nThailand provide limited amounts of electricity to homes, industry, and commerce, albeit at \nsubstantially higher prices than those paid by EdL customers. \n \n49.  The economic benefits of extending grid supply to unserved areas are estimated for \nincremental and nonincremental consumption. Benefits for existing consumption levels are \nbased  on  the  cost  of  alternative  energy  sources  when  grid  electricity  is  absent,  and  on \nconsumers\u2019 willingness to pay when it is available. Benefits were estimated separately for poor \nand nonpoor residential consumers, and for industrial, commercial, and irrigation customers. \n \n50.  Derivations for the willingness-to-pay demand curve were made for poor and nonpoor \nhouseholds, with the nonpoor divided into established and first-time consumers. The initial \nconsumption point of each demand curve is set and valued individually based on the load profile \nof each category, reflecting its ability to pay.  \n \n51.  Estimated costs of private power supply for commercial customers are based on the use \nof a 40 kW gas oil generator, and for industrial customers, on a 200 kW gas oil generator. The \ncost of alternative energy sources for irrigation is based on the estimated cost for diesel pumps \n ", "13 \nwith  an  8-horsepower  motor.  As  for  domestic  customers,  benefits  were  estimated  for \nincremental and nonincremental consumption levels based on load forecasts for the three \nconsumer segments. \n \n52.  The economic analysis is carried out at border price level using 2003 prices. Financial \nproject costs were converted into economic cost by deducting taxes and duties. No price \ncontingencies are included in the base capital cost, but the economic capital costs include \nphysical contingencies. Costs were separated into foreign exchange and local costs, and a \nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  has  been  applied  to  local  costs.  Annual  operation  and \nmaintenance costs were also calculated in economic prices as a percentage of the total capital \ninvestment cost. The economic cost also includes provision for residential wiring, which is \nexcluded from financial cost. Energy costs have been valued based on the actual export price of \nelectricity as the foregone economic benefit. System losses were calculated separately for each \nnew feeder based on estimated peak demand and on load and loss factors, and included in \nestimating energy costs. On the basis of a comparison of economic costs and benefits over a \n35-year project lifetime, including the construction period and excluding any residual value, the \neconomic internal rate of return was estimated at 23.3%, with a net present value of KN356 \nbillion. Sensitivity testing and risk analysis show that the Project will be robust in all scenarios. A \ndistribution analysis showed that electricity consumers and local labor will benefit from the \nProject, while the Government return on the Project will be negative as a result of the highly \nsubsidized tariff structure. The poverty impact ratio was estimated to be 10%. Details of the \neconomic, distribution, and risk analysis and the sensitivity tests are in Appendix 11. \n \n2.  Financial Analysis \n53.  The Project\u2019s financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is based on the Project\u2019s capital and \noperating  and  maintenance  costs,  and  revenue  generated  from  new  connections  and \nincremental energy sales. The project FIRR is 2.71% (Appendix 12). The pro forma net annual \nrevenues  are  generally  positive  and  cover  project  operating  expenses.  However,  with  a \nweighted average cost of capital at 4.77%, the financial returns of the investment do not exceed \ntotal project financing cost. Although the financial performance of the Project is marginal, its \nimpact on EdL\u2019s operation is minimal compared to EdL\u2019s total domestic sales. Total projected \nenergy sales from the project areas are only 8% of EdL\u2019s projected domestic turnover in 2010. A \nmore meaningful measure of project performance in this case is the average cost recovery ratio \n(i.e., financial benefit-cost ratio). Based on the projected real tariffs in 2005, the Project\u2019s cost \nrecovery ratio is 95%, indicating that 95% of total project capital and operating costs are \nrecovered directly from sales revenue, and is considered satisfactory given the nature of rural \nelectrification programs. \n54.  A low FIRR raises the important question of how the Project can be sustained so that \neconomic benefits will continue to materialize and accrue to the targeted beneficiaries. Rural \nelectrification  alone  is  rarely  financially  viable  in  developing  member  countries  and  often \nrequires cross-subsidization from other consumer groups. While retail tariff for almost all Lao \nconsumer groups will be below the long-run marginal cost when connections begin, the cross-\nsubsidy needs to come from another source within EdL or directly from the Government. The \ncurrent Lao PDR\u2019s fiscal problems prevent an explicit subsidy transfer from the Government. \nEdL earns additional revenue (in dollars and baht) from exporting surplus energy to Thailand. \nEven as more energy is required domestically, exports to Thailand will remain a significant \nportion of EdL\u2019s turnover as new generation is commissioned and connected to EdL\u2019s supply \nsystem. This export revenue boosts EdL\u2019s financial performance, hedges a portion of EdL\u2019s \nforeign  exchange  risks,  and  helps  EdL  meet  its  financial  obligations  to  lenders  and  the \n ", "14 \nGovernment. Export revenue is, in effect, a government subsidy to EdL for carrying out rural \nelectrification and will ensure that the Project will be sustainable despite its marginal financial \nperformance. \n \nB.  Project Impacts \n1.  Environment \n55.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken for the Project. A summary \nIEE is in Appendix 13. The IEE concluded that only minor potential impacts would be expected \nbecause of the following: \n(i)  The transmission lines will pass through areas where people engage in hunting, \nlogging, and shifting cultivation. \n \n(ii)  The route was selected to avoid environmentally sensitive areas and areas with \nsocial, historical, and culture value. \n \n(iii)  Potential for resettlement is minimal. \n \n(iv)  Measures are available to mitigate potential impacts. \n56.  Wherever possible, the 115 kV lines will be parallel and close to existing roads to \nminimize environmental impacts. Mature forests and other environmentally sensitive areas will \nbe avoided. Construction will have other minor and temporary impacts, but measures are \nproposed to mitigate them. \n2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n57.  The social assessment carried out in the feasibility study identified the need to prepare a \nresettlement plan. In accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, only a short \nresettlement plan has been prepared because the Project will have insignificant21 involuntary \nresettlement impacts. The plan incorporates the Government\u2019s national policy on resettlement \nand compensation, decree on resettlement and compensation, and implementation regulations \nfor project-related resettlement and compensation.22 The plan is summarized in Appendix 14 \nand will be updated after the detailed design and measurement survey and approval by ADB. \n58.  EdL has made every effort to minimize land acquisition impacts by avoiding wherever \npossible villages and other settlement areas, agricultural land, and trees. Sites that will be \nacquired for the three substations and one \u201cT\u201d tap junction will affect only scrubland. Only two \nhouses that may be affected by a 115 kV line will have to relocate nearby. A minimum amount \nof mainly nonagricultural land will be required for 115 kV towers. Farmers will still be able to \ncultivate under the transmission lines and towers. Electric poles and lines will be adjacent to \nexisting roads between villages, and along roads and pathways in villages. The construction of \nlow- and medium-voltage distribution systems will entail height restrictions to 3 meters for trees \nand structures, requiring some trees to be cut. Actual impacts of transmission and distribution \n                                                 \n21 Resettlement is \u201csignificant\u201d where 200 or more persons are displaced from their houses and/or lose more than \n10% of their productive income-generating assets. \n22 Draft documents prepared under ADB Loan 1867: Environment and Social Program, for $20 million, approved \nNovember 2001; and TA 3746-LAO. Final documents were approved and issued by Government in May 2003. \n ", "15 \nlines will be determined only during detailed design. The short resettlement plan provides for full \ncompensation  for  all  losses  and  relocation.  All  compensation  and  resettlement  for  a \nsubcomponent will have to be completed, rehabilitation measures in place, and the contract \narea free of all encumbrances before award of the civil works contract for that component. \n59.  EdL has a well-established land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement procedure, \nwhich is not always implemented well because of limited staff and capacity. EdL has also \ndeveloped a comprehensive public involvement program for people affected by projects, but \nrequires adequate staff to implement the program well. EdL has established the Environment \nand Social Management Office, with an experienced environmental specialist manager, three \nenvironment specialists, and one social development specialist. The Project will strengthen this \noffice\u2019s capacity by helping EdL recruit and train another social development specialist and \nanother rural development specialist. \n3.  Poverty Impacts  \n60.  More than 43% of the project beneficiaries are poor. Many more live just above the \npoverty line and are in danger of falling below it. They live mainly by engaging in subsistence \nagriculture and providing manual labor, and are thus vulnerable to external shocks such as \nnatural disasters and poor economic growth. While energy is a major input into the livelihood of \nthe poor, they rely on high-cost sources such as diesel for lighting and batteries for radios, and \nmanual energy. Fuel poverty is a major burden, especially for women, who supply the manual \nenergy to process food. Fuel poverty also constrains the livelihoods of the poor, restricts \ncommerce, and reduces the ability of the poor to diversify their income sources. Most rural \nvillages have rice mills that run on diesel. The high cost of diesel is transferred to consumers, \nwhich results to high costs of using rice mills and thus deter the poorest from using more \nmodern and cheaper ways to process food. \n61.  The most immediate and direct project impact on the poor includes reducing cash \nexpenditure on energy. Unelectrified poor households spend from $1.00 to $1.25 per month on \ndiesel for lighting, or from 14% to 18% of total cash household income. Connecting poor \nhouseholds will immediately reduce cash expenditure to about $0.03, or less than 0.25% of \ncash income, so that scarce and fungible cash income can be diverted to other more beneficial \nexpenditure  items.  As  poor  households\u2019  electricity  consumption  is  likely  to  increase  as \nappliances become more affordable, expenditure on electricity will increase to around from 2 to \n3% of household income, normally within the first 2 years of electrification. \n62.  Other benefits of village electrification include reduced reliance on manual energy  to \nprocess food, which gives women more time and significantly reduces their workload, whether \nthe household is electrified or not. National data show that women living in villages with no \nelectricity spend approximately 14 hours a week processing food. Much time is spent manually \nprocessing rice, which could be done by rice mills. In villages with electricity, food processing \ntakes only 5 hours. Access to electricity may also improve social services, including education \nand health services, as children can study at night, and vaccines and other medications can be \nstored safely even in remote villages. Electric lighting at night will also keep households safe \nfrom wild animals and robbers. More people will enjoy social interaction and leisure when they \ncan  stay  out  longer  in  the  evenings.  Villagers  mentioned  that  they  would  receive  more \ninformation from the outside world through television. While the social benefits are difficult to \nquantify, they reflect improved quality of life and save money. Many social benefits have a \n\u201cpublic good\u201d character and are not limited to connected households. The detailed results of the \npoverty impact assessment are in Appendix 15. \n ", "16 \nC.  Project Risks  \n63.  The major risks facing the Project are the following: (i) incomplete implementation of \nEdL\u2019s FRP, including retail tariff increases; (ii) poor households\u2019 inability to pay connection \ncharges;  (iii)  delayed  consultant  appointment  and  bid  evaluation  processing;  and  (iv) \nunsatisfactory implementation of an approved resettlement plan before civil works start. To \nmitigate these risks, a number of measures, including associated loan covenants, have been \ndevised, involving the following: (i) financial covenants binding the Government and EdL to \nimplement  the  FRP;  (ii)  government  commitment  to  amortize  up-front  charges  for  poor \nhouseholds and officially approve the new connection policy; and (iii) advance recruitment of \nconsultants and advance procurement actions.  \nD.  Overall Assessment  \n64.  The project scope and estimated costs were established by a detailed feasibility study \nand found to be technically sound and appropriate. The Project\u2019s physical components form part \nof EdL\u2019s least-cost development plan, and technologies applied are reliable. Actions have been \nproposed to  minimize and mitigate potential project risks or minor social and environmental \nimpacts. The Project will fulfill the criteria for poverty intervention. Economic analysis has also \nshown  that  the  Project  will  have  robust  economic  returns.  The  Project  will,  therefore,  be \ntechnically and economically sustainable. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nD.  Specific Assurances \n65.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  EdL  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n1.  Financial Matters \n(i)  The Government will ensure or cause EdL to ensure the following: \n(a)  continue to implement EdL\u2019s FRP and revise EdL\u2019s capital expenditure \nprogram annually;  \n(b)  maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 for FY2003 and \nthereafter;  \n(c)  generate  internal  cash  of  at  least  30%  of  the  three-year  average  of \nplanned capital expenditures in FY2003 and thereafter;  \n(d)  maintain a debt-equity ratio of 1.5 or below; \n(e)  reduce EdL\u2019s accounts receivable for domestic electricity sales equivalent \nto 2 months\u2019 average sales by FY2003 and maintain this level thereafter; \n(f)  maintain  levels  of  electricity  tariffs  for  EdL  to  meet  its  financial  loan \ncovenants in FY2005 and thereafter; \n(g)  maintain the lifeline tariff block for residential consumers at no more than \n50 kWh/month; and \n(h)  offset  government,  provincial,  and  municipal  receivables  (including \narrears as of 31 December 2002) above 2 months\u2019 average sales against \nEdL\u2019s tax and other financial liabilities with the Government every quarter \nin 2004 and 2005, and submit quarterly statements to ADB concerning \nthese settlements.  \n ", "17 \n(ii)  The Government will arrange additional financing as required for EdL to meet \nassurances set out in (b), (c), and (d) of (i) for FY 2003 and thereafter. \n(iii)  The  Government  and  EdL  will  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart funds are \navailable on time to meet all local-cost components of the Project. \n(iv)  Unless it complies with covenants contained in (a), (b), (c), and (h) of (i) for fiscal \n2003  and  thereafter,  EdL  will  not  declare  any  dividend  to  the  Government. \nCompliance with (a), (b), and (c) will be certified by audited financial statements \nfor the fiscal year. Compliance with (h) will be monitored by EdL and ADB \nquarterly. \n2.  Social, Environmental, and Resettlement Matters \n(i)  EdL will ensure that the Project will fully comply with  ADB\u2019s Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  regulations \nthroughout  project  implementation,  and  meet  the  mitigation  and  monitoring \nrequirements described in the IEE. Project budget will be set aside to implement \nthe mitigation measures identified in the IEE to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n(ii)  Full census and inventory of lost assets of people affected by the Project will be \nundertaken following detailed design during project implementation. An updated \nresettlement plan will be prepared and submitted to ADB for approval before land \nacquisition for those components. \n(iii)  The updated resettlement plan approved by ADB will be implemented to its \nsatisfaction. Before the award of civil works contract for each component, all \npeople  it  affects  will  be  satisfactorily  compensated  and  resettled,  and \nrehabilitation  measures  will  be  in  place  in  accordance  with  the  updated \nresettlement plan, government procedures, and ADB's  policy on involuntary \nresettlement. \n(iv)  Contractors will not pay men and women unequal wages for equal work. Child \nlabor will not permitted under the Project. \n(v)  EdL will submit a detailed implementation plan of the PPME for ADB\u2019s review \nand  concurrence  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  and  annual  PPME \nreports within 1 month after the end of each calendar year. \n(vi)  EdL will assign at least one staff at each provincial branch office by the end of \n2003 to be responsible for social and environmental management. \n3.  Operational Matters \n(i)  EdL will use its own funds to continually carry out the loss reduction program and \nensure that the total domestic distribution loss will be less than 17% by the end of \n2003, 16% by 2004, and 15% by 2005, and maintain those levels thereafter. EdL \nwill annually submit to ADB the progress report on the LRU\u2019s operations and \nmanagement and the statistics of total system losses. \n(ii)  EdL will annually prepare and provide to ADB for its review and comment a draft \npower development plan for all capital expenditures planned for the subsequent \n10 years, including EdL\u2019s load forecast, investment requirements for generation, \ntransmission, and distribution; indicative financing assumptions; and its financial \nprojections over the same period. \n(iii)  EdL will continue to implement the MIH policy under which EdL will fund 100% of \nthe low-voltage distribution costs for villages.  \n(iv)  EdL will issue information on the amortization option for residential consumers \nwith 3/9 ampere meter connections to all branch offices and consumers at least 2 \nmonths  before  connections  are  made.  Amortization  will  apply  to  all  EdL \n ", "18 \nresidential consumers with 3/9 ampere meter connections, including consumers \nin areas not supported by ADB, by the end of 2003. \n(v)  At least 2 months before connections are made, EdL will implement a consumer \nawareness  campaign  on  the  safe  use  of  electricity,  billing  practices,  and \nconnection policy. \n(vi)  EdL will establish a socioeconomic cell and assign appropriate counterpart staff \nto train in systematic data collection, benefit monitoring, and economic modeling. \n(vii)  EdL  will  strengthen  its  Environmental  and  Social  Management  Office  by \nengaging at least one social development specialist and one rural development \nspecialist by the end of 2003. \nVI.

Background \n1.  The power sector  in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)  is still in its \ninfancy, with only 34% of households having access to electricity, according to the Hydropower \nOffice, Ministry of Industry and Handicraft (MIH). The sector has the potential to be pivotal in \nachieving the Government\u2019s social and economic development objectives by expanding the \navailability of low-cost, reliable electricity within the country and earning foreign exchange from \nsales to the region. The power sector policy encourages optimal use of the country\u2019s natural \nresources,  promoting  efficiency  in  power  sector  institutions  and  creating  a  conducive \nenvironment for responsible infrastructure investment, public and private.  \n \nB.  Power System Facilities and Operations \n2.  The power system facilities cover the Northern, Central 1, Central 2, and Southern \nregions, serving about 250,000 customers. The largest two regions, Northern and Central 1, \nwhich cover Vientiane Prefecture and Vientiane and Louang Phrabang provinces, as well as \nother surrounding areas, are supplied from the Nam Ngum hydropower station (150 megawatts \n[MW]) and partly from the recently completed Nam Leuk hydropower station (60 MW). The \nsouthern region covers Saravan and Champassak provinces and is supplied from the Xeset (45 \nMW) and Selabam (5 MW) hydropower stations.

The Lao PDR is endowed with significant hydropower resources. Export of hydropower \nis the largest single foreign exchange earner for the country. The Government thus emphasizes \ndevelopment of export-oriented hydropower projects and mobilizing private sector investment. \nWith external assistance, two IPP hydropower projects with substantial generating capacities \nwere completed recently, and demand for electricity for domestic use and export is growing \nrapidly.

Power Sector Development \n6.  Electricity is supplied through main grids and off grid. Three sources provide generation \nfor EdL main grids: (i) small or medium-sized power generation projects, generally up to about \n100 MW, developed by EdL primarily to supply the national market; (ii) domestic off-take \nentitlements from IPPs; and (iii) imports from neighboring countries (Thailand and Viet Nam). \nGeneration for export is provided from two sources: (i) surplus electricity from EdL\u2019s domestic \nhydropower projects and (ii) IPP hydropower projects. \n \n7.  Unserved  areas  are  targeted  by  grid  extension  projects,  off-grid  development,  and \ndomestic off-take entitlements from IPP projects. Grid extension is used to supply the main \ncenters and densely populated areas on the floodplains of the Mekong and its tributaries. Off-\ngrid electrification through isolated grids\u2014from provincial and town to multi- and single-village \ngrids\u2014is more advantageous than a high-cost grid extension thinly distributed over difficult \nterrain.  \n \n8.  Less  than  20%  of  villages  have  electricity,  which  limits  commercialization  and \ndiversification of the economy. Poverty incidence strongly correlates with the lack of electricity. \nThe Government thus gives electrification high priority, particularly in rural areas, and expects \nthat by 2010 70% of the population will have electricity.  \n \n9.  The financial and technical resources needed to expand export capacity and extend \nrural electrification are far beyond the Government\u2019s means and requires partnership between \npublic and private investors. This partnership, however, will depend on reforms and measures to \nstrengthen the energy sector and to ensure that the people share equitably in the benefits of \nhydropower development. \n  \n10.  Given the pivotal economic role of the power sector, the Government has focused on \nharnessing private sector resources to accelerate power development. As part of the market-\noriented economic restructuring, foreign capital is encouraged and regulated. \n \n11.  The  Government  has  restructured  and  commercialized  power  sector  institutions  to \nenhance  their  operating  efficiency.  EdL,  the  state-owned  national  power  utility,  is  being \ncommercialized through the following measures: (i) EdL was incorporated as a public company \nunder a charter approved by MIH on 29 December 1997; (ii) EdL average retail tariffs were \nincreased by 3.0% per month from 1999 to 2001 and again by 2.3% per month starting in May \n2002 through April 2005; (iii) EdL signed a performance contract plan for 2001-2003 with the \n ", "Appendix 3  25 \nMinistry of Finance and MIH in February 2001, which establishes targets for EdL\u2019s technical, \ncommercial, and financial performance; commits the Government to improve EdL\u2019s financial \nviability (including through tariff increases); and provides for monitoring of compliance by MIH; \n(iv) Reorganized into profit centers, EdL introduced formal cost accounting and internal transfer \npricing for each profit center; (v) Formal auditing practices have been adopted and an external \nauditing firm engaged beginning in 1998; and (vi) A loss reduction unit has been established \nand investments are being made to reduce losses. \nD.  Key Development Challenges \n12.  Power potential should be harnessed to best serve the people\u2019s interests, especially to \nreduce poverty by promoting sustainable economic growth. Large-scale projects can and should \nbe supported if community groups displaced by such projects are fully compensated, if the \nenvironmental effects are carefully assessed and mitigated, and if the net benefits are shared \nequitably  between  investors  and  the  people  as  owners  of  the  resources.  The  revenues \ngenerated from increased export earnings will be vital to improving basic government services, \nincluding education, health, and infrastructure services in poor areas. \n13.  The development strategy should distinguish between the appropriate roles for the \npublic and private sectors, taking account of the Lao PDR\u2019s continuing transition to a market-\nbased economy. The private sector should be encouraged to invest in electricity generation and \ndistribution,  leaving  the  Government  to  focus  on  the  regulatory  framework  and  overall \ntransmission system.  \n14.  Other management issues also demand public attention and resolution. Electricity use is \nhighly subsidized and, despite monthly increases in domestic tariffs since early 1999, full cost \nrecovery is still distant. EdL thus has a serious debt burden, which also reflects EdL\u2019s history of \nborrowing unprotected for exchange rate risk. The sharp devaluation of the kip following the \nAsian  financial  crisis  has  greatly  deepened  EdL\u2019s  problems.  EdL  must  be  strengthened \nfinancially and made more efficient. \n15.  The Government is an investor in power development and the regulator of the sector, \nwhich leads to conflicting interests. The Government\u2019s encouragement of social and economic \ndevelopment through electrification at highly subsidized tariffs, for example, is counter to sound \npower management and EdL\u2019s commercial viability. If the Government wishes to be a regulator \nand an investor, then it should establish an institutional framework that ensures that the two \nroles do not conflict. \n16.  International  best  practices  should  help  determine  the  right  course  of  action.  The \nGovernment has drawn from these practices, notably adjusting the pricing system to harmonize \nwith cost recovery principles. The Government is also restructuring EdL\u2019s debt obligations and \ninitiating other institutional and regulatory matters central to sound management of the power \nsector. EdL has successfully engaged the private sector as a partner in power development. \nHowever, the Government should consider consolidating this experience, drawing benefits from \npower projects through concession fees, royalties, and taxation. Seeking a large ownership \nposition  through  equity  participation  can  be  risky,  and  may  not  conform  to  EdL\u2019s  or  the \nGovernment\u2019s financial interests. \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nPREVIOUS ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SECTOR \n \n                  Amount   Date of \n Loan        Project              ($)    Approval \n65-LAO  Vientiane Power Distribution  3,370,000  06 May 1971 \n128-LAO(SF)  Vientiane Power Distribution (supplementary)  1,350,100  03 May 1971 \n501-LAO(SF)  Vientiane Plain Rural Electrification  4,300,000  19 Dec 1980 \n642-LAO(SF)  Vientiane Plain Rural Electrification (phase II)  6,300,000  11 Oct 1983 \n698-LAO(SF)  Xeset Hydropower (TA loan)  1,000,000  23 Oct 1984 \n846-LAO(SF)  Xeset Hydropower  15,500,000  27 Oct 1987 \n928-LAO(SF)  Nam Ngum-Louang Phrabang Power  11,000,000  06 Dec 1988 \nTransmission \n1063-LAO(SF)  Xeset Hydropower (supplementary)  3,000,000  11 Dec 1990 \n1214-LAO(SF)  Nam Song Hydropower Development  31,500,000  21 Dec 1992 \n1308-LAO(SF)  Nam Ngum-Louang Phrabang Power     \n  Transmission (supplementary)  4,000,000  30 Aug 1994 \n1329-LAO(SF)  Theun-Hinboun Hydropower Project  60,000,000  08 Nov 1994 \n1456-LAO(SF)  Nam Leuk Hydropower Project  52,000,000  10 Sept 1996 \n1558-LAO(SF)  Power Transmission and Distribution  30,000,000  30 Sept 1997 \n  Total  223,320,000   \nTechnical Assistance       \n275-LAO  Vientiane Plain Rural Electrification  140,000  22 Dec 1978 \n374-LAO  Xeset Hydropower  246,000  14 Nov 1980 \n909-LAOa  Xeset Hydropower (implementation)  1,760,000  27 Oct 1987 \n1080-LAO  Xieng Khouang and Sayaburi Power     \n  Transmission Study  85,000  03 Jan 1989 \n1081-LAO  Nam Ngum Hydropower Station     \n  Operational Study  192,000  03 Jan 1989 \n1082-LAO  Institutional Improvement to EdL     \n  Louang Phrabang  198,000  03 Jan 1989 \n1221-LAO  Nam Song-Nam Leuk Hydropower      \n  Development Feasibility Study  500,000  10 Nov 1989 \n1301-LAOb  Nam Ngum-Louang Phrabang Power     \n  Transmission  960,000  29 Mar 1989 \n909-LAOc  Xeset Hydropower (supplementary)  1,000,000  14 Dec 1990 \n1532-LAOd  Nam Song-Nam Leuk Hydropower      \n  Development Feasibility Study  1,300,000  08 Jul 1991 \n1548-LAO  Nam Mang 3 Prefeasibility Study  50,000  07 Aug 1991 \n1301-LAOb  Nam Ngum-Louang Phrabang Power     \nTransmission  \n  Supplementary  1,034,000  14 Oct 1992 \n2054-LAO  Theun-Hinboun Power Legal Power  100,000  04 Jan 1994 \n2479-LAOd  Power Transmission and Distribution  250,000  18 Dec 1995 \n2569-LAOd  Corporate and Financial Development of EdL  340,000  15 May 1996 \n2583-LAOd  Power System Planning in the Ministry of     \n  Industry and Handicraft  600,000  07 Jun 1996 \n2728-LAOd  Study for Establishing Lao      \n  National Grid Company  600,000  23 Dec 1996 \n3087-LAOd  Northern Area Rural Power Distribution Project   580,000  28 Nov 1997 \n2926-LAOd  Nam Ngum 500 kV Transmission Project  510,000  14 Oct 1998  \n  Power Distribution     \n3374-LAOd  Power Sector Strategy Study  800,000  23 Dec 1999 \n  Total  11,245,000   \nEdL = Electricit\u00e9 du Laos, kV = kilovolt, TA = technical assistance. \na   United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) funds. \nb  Swiss funds. \nc  Norwegian funds. \nd  Japan special funds. \n ", "Appendix 5  27 \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS OF ELECTRICIT\u00c9 DU LAOS \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The financial performance of Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) since 1998 has been significantly \naffected by the depreciation of the kip during the Asian financial crisis.

Profitability and Cash Flow \n2.  As  EdL  borrows  almost  all  of  its  funds  in  foreign  currency  (typically  dollars),  the \ndepreciation of the kip has dramatically affected EdL\u2019s ability to remain profitable and meet its \nfinancial ratios from internal operations. The depreciation of the kip has resulted in large foreign \nexchange losses on loans, which must be serviced from EdL\u2019s kip-denominated cash flow. \nEdL\u2019s profitability in the last several years is attributed to nonoperating income (dividends from \nthe Theun-Hinboun Power Company, of which EdL owns 60%), which covers the foreign \nexchange losses on existing debt. EdL\u2019s operating efficiency and tariff levels should, therefore, \nbe assessed. \n3.  While  it  has  remained  positive,  EdL\u2019s  cash  flow  from  internal  sources  has  been \ndecreasing in recent years. This trend can be partly attributed to the declining share of export \nrevenue, denominated in dollars and baht, which has helped mitigate some of EdL\u2019s foreign \nexchange losses. As the share of electricity exported declines relative to domestic sales, cash \nflow decreases as domestic tariffs do not cover the full cost of service. Technical losses, low \ntariffs, and low collection of accounts receivable need to be addressed. Accounts receivable \nhave remained significantly above the Asian Development Bank (ADB) covenant level of 2 \n ", "28  Appendix 5 \nmonths\u2019 worth of sales, mostly attributable to unpaid government sales (11.0 months in 2001) \nand domestic sales (4.5 months). \nC.  Tariffs  \n4.  Low average retail tariffs contributed to the poor performance of EdL as it expanded its \nelectrification rate. While revenues from export sales cross-subsidized these domestic sales \nover the past several years, declining export revenue will expose EdL\u2019s weak financial position \nand the need for significant retail tariff restructuring. \n5.  EdL carried out a detailed tariff study1 in late 2001, which justified applying for a new \ntariff increase with the Government. This tariff report indicated that the long-run marginal cost \nfor  EdL  was  approximately  KN741  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  in  2002.  The  tariff  study  also \nanalyzed the appropriate lifeline tariff (now set at 50 kWh) and revenue analysis as required for \nEdL to meet its loan covenants in the next couple of years.

Financial Restructuring  \n6.  In late 1999 the Government approved a comprehensive financial recovery program \n(FRP) for EdL to restore its financial viability and improve its ability to meet future investment \nneeds through self-financing. The plan was developed with assistance from the World Bank and \nADB, EdL\u2019s key creditors. The FRP underscores the Government\u2019s commitment to EdL and the \npower sector, provides financial terms to encourage further rural electrification and expansion of \nthe  national  grid,  and  puts  EdL  on  commercial  footing.  The  FRP  includes  the  following \nprovisions: \n                                                 \n1 Power Supply Tariff Study \u2013 Final Report, February 2002, EdL. \n ", "Appendix 5  29 \n7.  Conversion of Electricit\u00e9 du Laos Debt to Equity. The Government converted $69 \nmillion of EdL debt into government equity in 2001, including the re-lent proceeds of Loan \n1329.2 This conversion was equivalent to the Government injecting additional equity capital into \nEdL, which was needed to reduce its debt leverage.  \n8.  Variable Remittance to the Government as Taxes and Dividends. The Government \nagrees that EdL can retain dividends from its subsidiary investments, notably Theun Hinboun \nPower Company (THPC), to ensure that EdL complies with the financial loan covenants of the \nWorld Bank and ADB. Should EdL comply, it pays 29% of total net income as dividends to the \nGovernment, giving EdL more flexibility in managing its finances and the ability to reinvest \ndividends in capital expansion. ADB supports this agreement but EdL needs to discuss a \nlonger-term solution with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on the dividends to ensure proper equity \ncapitalization. \n9.  Revaluation of Fixed Assets. The Government agreed to revalue 100% of fixed assets \ndirectly related to power generation, transmission, and distribution. ADB deemed the revaluation \nstudy acceptable as it was incorporated into a comprehensive financial restructuring plan, and \nasset revaluation will be permitted for all Lao businesses in the future. The final study report \nwas completed in November 2002, and the results are being translated in the 2002 financial \nstatements.  Asset  revaluation  will  substantially  increase  the  depreciation  expense  of  EdL, \nthereby reducing its net income and tax liability with the Government. \n10.  Relaxation of Repayment Terms of Subsidiary Loan Agreements. In 2001 MOF and \nEdL amended most of its subsidiary loan agreements with World Bank and ADB. These steps \ninclude reducing interest rates and extending repayment terms by five years on existing loans. \nThe  amendments  are  reasonable,  considering  the  extended  terms  are  only  a  temporary \nrelaxation.  EdL\u2019s  debt  service  burden  is  reduced  until  other  financial  measures  can  be \nimplemented, improving EdL\u2019s operational cash flow. ADB formally approved the amended \nagreements  in  January  2003.  EdL  agreed  to  involve  ADB  in  any  future  plans  for  debt \nrestructuring. \n11.  Maintenance  of  Electricity  Tariffs  to  Meet  Electricit\u00e9  du  Laos\u2019s  Financial \nObjectives. After conducting a tariff study in 2002, the Government agreed to a schedule of \nretail electricity tariff increases starting in May 2002. Tariffs will increase for all consumer \nclasses at 2.3% per month (a compounded annualized rate of 31.0%) through April 2005. This \nschedule will increase tariffs to approximately KN612/kWh ($.053/kWh) in 2005 (Table A5.2). \nWhile still below full cost recovery, this decision clearly indicates the Government\u2019s support for \nEdL to become a more commercial entity. The Government agreed to fully implement the tariff \nschedule as planned, and EdL will inform ADB of any deviation from the plan, as it would \nsignificantly affect long-term financial performance. \n12.  Review of Electricit\u00e9 du Laos\u2019s Capital Expenditure Program. EdL has agreed to \nregularly review its capital expenditure program (officially, EdL\u2019s Power Development Plan) and \nits ability to finance the expansion program through new debt and internal cash generation. ADB \nsupported this planning effort through TA 3374-LAO: Power Sector Strategy Study. The World \nBank is also funding a study to update the recommendations and analysis based on recent \nchanges. EdL will annually update a more robust and analytical power development plan by \nconsidering  short-  and  long-term  strategy,  combined  planning  of  domestic  and  export \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 1994.

Manila. \n ", "30  Appendix 5 \ngeneration on a least-cost basis, and integration of technical planning with the subregional grid \nsystem. These developments will reduce technical, commercial, and financial risks to EdL as it \nexpands its service. \n13.  Limitation on the period of debt-servicing relief to Electricit\u00e9 du Laos. While it \nstrongly  supports  EdL,  the  Government  also  stipulates  its  intent  to  consider  a  phased \nwithdrawal  of  financial  support  as  EdL\u2019s  operations  become  more  commercial  and  self-\nsustaining. ADB appreciates the Government\u2019s limitation to provide assistance due to fiscal \nconstraints, but with an electrification target rate of 90% by 2020, it is unlikely that EdL can \nfinance this expansion without additional government financing assistance. EdL may require \ngovernment equity injections (direct or through conversions to equity) to prevent it becoming too \nleveraged. This issue will be addressed when future power development plans are submitted to \nADB for review and comment. \n14.  Most of the FRP has already been implemented, and tariff increases began in May 2002. \nThis is the Government\u2019s strongest signal of intent to  support EdL and transform it into a \ncommercially viable organization. Other aspects (e.g. asset revaluation) are being translated in \nthe 2002 financial statements. EdL agreed to ensure full implementation of the FRP; comply \nwith ongoing provisions on tariff levels, dividend remittances, and capital expenditure review; \nand keep ADB informed of its completion. \nE.  Future Financial Performance  \n15.  EdL\u2019s projected financial statements are in Table A5.3. EdL has greatly improved its \nfinancial and operational performance as a result of the FRP in FY2002 (based on unaudited \nestimated results) and also because the Government applied the $33 million THPC proceeds3 to \noutstanding  liabilities  with  MOF.  Asset  revaluation  results  were  much  greater than initially \nestimated during the drafting of the FRP, so future financial performance appears to be stronger \nthan anticipated.  \n16.  EdL\u2019s  financial  performance  depends  on  full  and  timely  retail  tariff  increases  and \nrationalization of the Power Development Plan. Tariffs will continue to increase until they reach \nan estimated equivalent level of KN612/kWh in 2005. Tariffs will, at minimum, need to be \nmaintained at this level in real terms, meaning that further increases will be required after 2005 \nto keep pace with exchange rate movements. EdL is planning a more detailed tariff review in \n2003 to see how the tariff structure and rates can be changed to eventually move toward full \ncost recovery. \n17.  Projections for some of EdL\u2019s financial ratios (specifically, debt service coverage and \ndebt-equity ratio) are declining from 2003 to 2010. While these ratios have been complied with \nfor several years, their deterioration is related to the ambitious capital expenditure program to \nreach a nationwide electrification ratio of 90% in 2020. This plan assumes that debt will be used \nto finance expansion, even though lenders or donors do not appear committed to finance it. \nEven if this new debt is concessional, EdL\u2019s projected operations and growth may not sustain \nthe required debt service. EdL agrees to review and update its capital expansion plan and \ndevelop  financing  plans  (including  future  government  contributions  to  EdL  equity),  which \nindicates EdL\u2019s intent to remain financially viable. \n                                                 \n3 THPC refinanced its original financing package in May 2002 to take advantage of lower costs of debt than required \nfor financial close in 1996. THPC then returned 50% of the share capital to the owners, including EdL. Therefore, \n$33 million was returned to EdL in May 2002. \n ", "Appendix 5  31 \n18.  EdL agrees to financial loan covenants consistent with previous loans and to maintain \noperational and financial performance so that these covenants are met annually. ADB will \nassess covenants based on audited financial statements submitted within nine months after the \nclose of EdL\u2019s fiscal year (31 December). The following indicates financial loan covenant levels \nand steps required to ensure such levels are met during project implementation and principal \nrepayment. The Government also agrees that EdL will not remit any dividends until the audited \nfinancial  statements  certify  compliance  with  the  debt  service  coverage,  debt-equity,  self-\nfinancing, and government receivables settlement plan. \n19.  Self-Financing Ratio. EdL agrees to maintain a self-financing ratio of no less than 30%. \nThe revaluation of assets will increase allowable depreciation expense and reduce EdL\u2019s tax \nliabilities. This should enhance EdL\u2019s ability to meet its self-financing ratio covenant, but the \ncapital expenditure plan should still be reviewed regularly to ensure that it does not strain \nfinancial performance.  \n20.  Debt Service Coverage Ratio. EdL agrees to maintain net revenues of no less than 1.5 \ntimes annual debt service payments. This is an small increase from Loan 1558 covenants (1.3 \ntimes) to harmonize financial covenants with those of the World Bank. ADB recommends that \nEdL review its capital expenditure program to ensure that future projects are not financed with \nhigh levels of debt, which will jeopardize financial performance once the grace periods on \nprincipal repayment end.  \n21.  Debt-to-Equity Ratio: EdL agrees to maintain the ratio of its long-term debt to no more \nthan 1.5 times its equity. ADB believes this covenant warrants significant attention. EdL\u2019s \nfinancial projections and capital expenditure plan indicate that EdL will be unable to meet this \ncovenant after FY2004 due to the large amount of long-term debt assumed to finance capital \nexpansion. ADB requested MOF to ensure that the Government maintains significant equity in \nEdL  to  ensure  compliance.  As  long  as  EdL  maintains  the  Government\u2019s  shareholding  in \nindependent power producer projects, ADB will support EdL retaining Theun Hinboun dividends \nin the future. EdL\u2019s retention of these dividends is equivalent to future Government injections of \nequity, which will be required to sustain EdL\u2019s growth. \n22.  Accounts  Receivable:  ADB  is  concerned  about  the  growing  accounts  receivable, \nmostly with central government, provincial, and municipal offices. The Government has not \ncomplied  with  the  relevant  covenant  for  several  years.  While  ADB  is  cognizant  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal difficulties, EdL cannot function as a true commercial enterprise under the \nconditions of nonpayment without permission to terminate electricity service. EdL agrees to \nreduce its overall accounts receivable to no more than two months\u2019 average electricity sales. \nThe Government also agreed to offset EdL\u2019s arrears (calculated as of 31 December 2002) and \ncurrent government consumption above two months\u2019 average from EdL\u2019s tax and other financial \nliabilities with the Government. In May 2003 the Government confirmed that the first offsetting \npayment was made, and ADB and the Government have agreed on a schedule of consecutive \nquarterly  offsets  in  2004  and  2005  to  fully  settle  the  arrears.  Receivables  with  domestic \ncustomers also require improvement. EdL is introducing a new billing system that will permit \nEdL to carry out more detailed analysis and aging of the receivables, and increase timely bill \ncollection from delinquent customers.  \nF.  Conclusion \n23.  The completion of the FRP and other financially attractive beneficial transactions in 2002 \n(proceeds from THPC refinancing applied to outstanding liabilities with the Government) have \n ", "32  Appendix 5 \nhelped EdL recover from its financial crisis and become more stable. This position should allow \nEdL  operations  to  be  profitable  and  sustainable  for  the  next  several  years,  and  financial \nprojections indicate that EdL will meet its loan covenants from FY2002 to 2008, based on the \ncapital expenditure plan approved in 2001.  \n24.  Compliance  with  financial  covenants  could  become  a  problem,  however,  as  EdL \nattempts to balance ambitious capital expansions plans (including rural electrification projects \non behalf of the Government) with financial performance as a commercial organization. ADB \ncontinues to pursue financial improvements with EdL on operating efficiency and tariff increases \nand with MIH and MOF on sector structure and capitalization of EdL. ADB will ensure that the \ncapital expansion plans are reviewed and rationalized, which will reduce the pressures for \nadditional and excessive foreign debt borrowings. In this case, the risk of noncompliance with \nloan covenants will be mitigated through the above assurances and covenant to ensure direct \ngovernment financing (equity injections of cash) when and as required to ensure a financially \nsustainable EdL. \n ", " \nTable A5.3: Income Statement \n(KN millions) \nActual Estimated Projected\nYears 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\nDomestic turnover        1 08,046        1 77,952        2 30,345        3 91,410        5 75,460        7 69,125        8 54,575        9 30,614     1 ,011,337     1 ,111,176     1 ,209,867\n    Installation Fees and other Misc.

Introduction \n1.  Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) intends to provide electricity to Sayaburi, Xieng Khouang, \nOudomxai, Louang Namtha, and Xaisomboun in northern Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR). The Project consists of (i) construction of about 303 kilometers (km) of 115-kilovolt \n(kV) transmission lines, including shield-wire distribution at 34.5 kV; (ii) three 115.0, 34.5, and \n22.0 kV substations, and other extension work; (iii) construction of about 796 km of medium-\nvoltage (34.5 and 22.0 kV) distribution lines and distribution substations; (iv) construction of \napproximately 608 km of low-voltage [380-volt (V)] distribution lines and transformers, and \nconnection of about 33,800 households; and (v) miscellaneous work, including unexploded \nordnance (UXO) clearance, benefit monitoring program, and resettlement and compensation \nprogram. \n2.  A team of international consultants will be recruited to help EdL implement the Project \nand improve the agency\u2019s project management capacity. Consultants will focus on supervising \nand guiding project implementation and training EdL staff, while EdL\u2019s project management unit \nwill  be  responsible  for  project  implementation.  The  team  will  include  transmission  and \ndistribution specialists, social and environmental management and monitoring specialists, and a \nUXO quality assurance specialist. The consultants will perform the above tasks in the Lao PDR \nto improve the design and project supervision skills of EdL staff and, where possible, will use \nlocal expertise.  \n3.  Consultant  services  will  also  include  the  following  to  strengthen  EdL\u2019s  capacity  to \nundertake rural electrification: \n(i)  Capacity building for socioeconomic assessment. EdL is planning to establish a \nsocioeconomic cell within the Environment and Social Management Office to improve \ncoordination of electrification data collection, build a consumer database, and build in-\nhouse capacity for benefit monitoring. To use benefit monitoring data efficiently and build \ncapacity  to  evaluate  subprojects,  the  Nordic  Development  Fund  (NDF)  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) agreed to support capacity building for economic, social, and \npoverty  impact  assessments  of  subprojects.  The  capacity-building  component  will \ninclude training of three EdL staff in economic modeling for subproject evaluation. EdL \nwill appoint three staff to the socioeconomic cell, to be trained under the program. A \nnumber of field staff will be trained to collect subproject data to feed into the model. The \nconsultants will set up the computerized model, and establish a system for systematic \ndata gathering, including standardized questionnaires for socioeconomic surveys and \ntrain staff. The system will ensure that benefit monitoring directly feeds into subproject \ndesign and evaluation. The Appraisal Mission estimates that approximately 3 person-\nmonths will be required to set up the model, establish systematic data gathering, and \ntrain staff. Three more person-months will be required to design and implement the \nbenefit monitoring program. EdL agreed to use NDF credit for consulting services to \nbuild capacity for socioeconomic assessment and for the benefit monitoring program. \n \n(ii)  Consumer awareness campaign. The consultants will help EdL design and implement \nan information and awareness campaign on safe use of electricity. The awareness \ncampaign will also inform consumers of connection cost policy, tariffs, billing statements \nand timing of bills and due payment, and disconnection policy.

Background \n1.  In March 2001, the Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts (MIH) published the Power \nSector Policy Statement, which defines the priorities and objectives of the Government. The \nstatement emphasizes the need to strengthen and clarify the framework for independent power \nproducer (IPP) development to facilitate and promote transparent private participation in the \npower sector. \n \n2.  The statement does not specify sector-strengthening strategies. These were explored at \na workshop held in November 2002 and, based on these discussions, MIH and the Lao National \nCommittee on Energy (LNCE) developed the Power Sector Policy Implementation Plan. The \nplan defines the actions and time frame to strengthen of the power sector, including those to \nimprove promotion, selection, and development of IPPs. \n \n3.  The  statement  emphasizes  the  need  to  reform  institutional  structures  to  clarify \nresponsibilities,  strengthen  commercial  functions,  and  streamline  administration.  The \nGovernment has recognized the need to restructure how it participates as an equity investor in \nIPP projects so that the benefits to the people are maximized and that Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) \ncan focus on its core operations of domestic power supply and distribution. \n \n4.  To support IPP development and institutional restructuring, MIH and LNCE will conduct \na detailed study on IPP project selection and implementation, and stakeholder consultation. The \nconsulting  services  are  to  develop  a  systematic  framework  for  IPP  selection  and  project \ndevelopment that will do the following: \n \n(i)  Include transparent IPP project section criteria and clear project implementation \nprocedures. \n(ii)  Maximize revenue and nonrevenue benefits from IPP development. \n(iii)  Identify  and  structure  a  publicly  owned  vehicle  to  own  and  manage  the \nGovernment\u2019s existing and future IPP investments to bring financial expertise \nand discipline to bear on IPP investment decisions and allow EdL to focus on its \nutility responsibilities. \nB.  Scope of Work \n \n5.  The scope of work involves the development of a systematic IPP framework to develop \nprivate generation. In particular, the consultant will do the following: \n \n1.  Rationalize Independent Power Producer Mandates  \n6.  Tasks include the following: \n(i)  Review existing memorandums of understandings (MOUs) and concessions, \noutline which are inactive, and determine which of the inactive mandates are still \nlegally binding. \n ", "Appendix 10  47 \n(ii)  Develop criteria to determine which of the legally active mandates continue to \nserve the national interest, taking into account project economics and finance \nability, power market, environmental and social impacts, and characteristics of \nthe developer. Advise the Government on options regarding those mandates that \nare no longer in the national interest. \n(iii)  Assess inactive MOUs and concessions, and determine which can be terminated \nwith little or no negotiation or compensation. Outline the procedures to terminate \nand provide draft documentation to formally terminate inactive mandates. \n \n2.  Develop Independent Power Producer Project Selection Criteria \n7.  Tasks include the following: \n \n(i)  Review recent power generation planning studies and project feasibility studies, \nincluding the following: \n(a)  Power System Development Plan, (ongoing, World Bank); \n(b)  Power Development Plan 2001-2010, (November 2001, EdL); \n(c)  Power Sector Strategy Study (March 2002, ADB); and \n(d)  Hydropower  Development  Strategy  Study  (September  2000,  World \nBank). \n(ii)  Group potential IPP generation projects into generic categories according to their \nfinancing  and  risk  characteristics.  Prepare  risk  matrixes  and  propose \nimplementation modalities and indicative financing plans tailored for each project \ncategory. A project may be included in more than one category, depending on \nthe proposed development of a site (e.g. domestic or export, storage vs. run-of-\nriver, availability of multilateral support, etc.). \n(iii)  Propose objective criteria to decide which projects or categories of projects are \nbest  suited  for  private  sector  participation.  The  criteria  will  be  designed  to \nevaluate those projects with the greatest likelihood to reach financial close and to \nbenefit the Lao PDR. Accordingly, they will be selected based on the following, \namong other criteria: \n(a)  expected revenue benefits to the Government, with emphasis on taxes, \nroyalties, and/or dividends for export projects and low off-take price for \ndomestic projects; \n(b)  expected  nonrevenue  benefits  (e.g.  fulfillment  of  power  market \nrequirements, regional development, stability of domestic power system, \nand local infrastructure); \n(c)  avoidance of adverse social and environmental impacts; \n(d)  avoidance of opportunity costs (e.g. impacts on other projects and land \nuses); and \n(e)  ability to reach financial close (e.g. likelihood of financial support from \nreputable developers, commercial banks, multilateral agencies, and other \nlenders). \n \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \n3.  Develop Independent Power Producer Project Implementation Procedures \n8.  Tasks include the following: \n(i)  Outline transparent and competitive developer selection and project procurement \nmodels.  They  should  be  suitable  for  awarding  IPP  concessions,  taking  into \naccount the characteristics of different project categories defined under 7 (ii) \nabove.  \n(ii)  Any proposals for use of selection models that do not include some form of \ncompetitive  bidding  (negotiated  or  unsolicited)  should  be  identified,  and  the \ncircumstances where they could be permitted outlined. \n(iii)  Prepare  a  draft  manual  on  IPP  project  procurement  procedures,  specifying \nprocedures for evaluating and awarding IPP concessions for the different project \ncategories.

Load Forecast \n1.  Load  forecasts  were  estimated  for  four  major  consumption  categories:  domestic, \ncommercial, agriculture/irrigation, and industrial. The domestic category was further divided by \nincome level and whether households are using off-grid services or not. To accommodate other \nconsumer categories, a residual amount of  demand was allocated for other domestic and \nindustrial consumers.  \n \n2.  For the domestic category, 1,900 villages in 21 districts in the project area, identified \nfrom existing data, were screened to prepare a list of villages within several kilometers of the \nmain roads as principal candidates for electrification and to obtain population and household \ndata for load forecasting. Subsequent field visits indicated that many communities were too \nremote to be economically connected to the grid in the short to medium term. Thus, the number \nof villages under consideration for electrification was reduced to about 700. These villages were \nassigned to one of four classifications based on income level and typical pattern of energy \nconsumption.  Data  on  population,  population  growth,  and  migration  patterns  were  also \nconsidered.  \n \n3.  Some 800 households in the study area were surveyed to obtain indicative measures of \neconomic activity, social and housing conditions, ownership of households assets, and energy \nuse. Livelihood  and production systems of households were also assessed as well as the \nenergy sources that are used for those activities. The analysis of energy use of households \nincluded information on sources, use and cost of different fuels for different household and \nagricultural  activities,  supply  of  electricity  and  other  energy  sources,  and  attitudes  toward \nelectricity. Selected villages that had been electrified in the last 3\u20134 years were also surveyed to \nprepare demand forecasts for individual villages.  \n \n4.  Based on the socioeconomic survey carried out under the project preparatory technical \nassistance (PPTA),1 a list of typical household appliances and their daily use in hours was \nestablished to arrive at a daily load pattern for domestic consumers. Assumptions were made \nabout the percentage of ownership of these appliances for the three different income levels for \nyear 0, the year of project commissioning, and for year 15 after commissioning to reflect \ninduced consumption patterns as a result of economic growth. The load pattern was further \nanalyzed by applying these consumption patterns by income level to four village classifications. \nEach classification was assumed to have a fixed mix of the three income classifications. \nEstablished  consumers  using  off-grid  services  are  assumed  to  have  a  higher  annual \nconsumption than first-time consumer households since the former will have already purchased \nmore diverse appliances than the latter. A fourth domestic category was introduced to reflect \nconsumption by the poor. Their share was calculated based on the census data of households \nbelow the national poverty line for each district.  \n \n5.  To  calculate  the  replacement  portion  of  energy  to  be  displaced  by  the  Project, \nhouseholds consuming power from off-grid systems available for restricted hours a day were \nsurveyed  and  the  billing  information  reviewed  to  calculate  monthly  consumption  rates. \nConsumption rates range from 4.0 kilowatt-hour (kWh)/month to 33.5 kWh/month for a system \nthat operates only 4 hours daily. A monthly electricity consumption of 4 kWh is equivalent to \noperating two small kerosene or diesel lamps, the main alternate energy source for lighting, for \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to Lao PDR for the Northern Area Rural Power Distribution Project. Manila. \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \nthree hours daily. The survey found that residential consumers prefer to have at least one light \nin each room plus one outside light. Assuming that poor households live in single-room houses, \na replacement consumption of 44 kWh/year for poor households appears realistic.  \n \n6.  For  nonpoor  first-time domestic customers, the replacement portion is considerably \nhigher  although  electricity  is  initially  only  used  for  lighting.  However,  nonpoor  domestic \ncustomers live in larger houses and use more lights longer. Using two 20-watt (W) fluorescent \nlights, one 40 W fluorescent bulb, and one 60 W incandescent light for a few hours each day \nresults in annual consumption of 254 kWh per year. Besides better and more lighting, the \nnonpoor established domestic customers have small appliances such as fans, radios, sewing \nmachines, and color televisions, resulting in a replacement portion of about 560 kWh/year.  \n \n7.  Induced consumption for poor households is assumed to be for lighting only since other \nappliances might be too expensive. Acquisition of more lighting sources and longer daily use will \nresult in an annual consumption after 15 years equivalent to the replacement portion of nonpoor \nfirst-time households. They are assumed to acquire the same type of small appliances as the \nnonpoor established households had during year 1 and, thus, their annual consumption after 15 \nyears is estimated to be about the same. Nonpoor established households will make more \nintensive use of their existing appliances and lighting sources once connected to the grid. \nHowever, such households will also acquire more appliances, of which refrigerators and fans \nare the most popular, resulting in an annual consumption of about 1,400 kWh. Graphs showing \nthe demand curves for the three domestic categories are in Figures A11.1\u2013A11.3. \n \n8.  Given the limitations of Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) to connect all households immediately, \n50% of all rural and 60% of urban households are assumed to be electrified in the first year of \nproject commissioning, then rise gradually to 80% for rural and 90% for urban households over \n10 years.  \n \n9.  A similar analysis was carried out for nondomestic consumption. The energy situation for \ncommercial and industrial activities in each project area was analyzed. If grid or off-grid supply \nwas available, the data on number of customers and operating hours per day were collected. \nProvincial authorities were interviewed about ongoing and planned investment and expected \npower  demand.  For  each  of  the  four  village  classifications  a  number  of  commercial  and \nindustrial uses are assumed based on the field survey findings. For example, the largest village \nwould have government offices, a hospital, and senior-level schools, as well as an allowance for \nlarger industrial supply such as a sawmill or garment factory. The remote village would have \ninstead a junior school and community water pumps and only less industrial consumption. \nFigure A11.1: Demand Curve-\u2014Non-Poor New Customer \n0.6\n0.5\nh) 0.4\nW\nk\ne ($/ 0.3\nc\nPri 0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\nQuantity Demanded (kWh/yr)\n \n    kWh/yr = kilowatt-hour per year. \n ", "Appendix 11  53 \nFigure A11.2: Demand Curve\u2014Non-Poor Existing Customer \n \n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\nQuantity Demanded (kWh/yr)\nkWh/yr = kilowatt-hour per year. \n \n \nFigure A11.3: Demand Curve\u2014Poor New Customer \n \n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\nQuantity Demanded (kWh/yr)\n  kWh/yr = kilowatt-hour per year. \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \n10.  Electricity  consumption  for  irrigation  pumping  and  rice  milling  is  included  in  the \nagriculture/irrigation category. In the absence of specific plans to make irrigation pumping more \navailable, and considering that not all households will have access to individual pumps, the \nforecast includes a fixed allowance per household for all village classifications. This estimate \nwas based on assumptions about water requirements for irrigating rice and average lift, and that \nabout 20% of households would opt for electric pumping. Electricity consumption for rice milling \nhas been estimated based on daily rice consumption and the operating specifications of a \nmedium-sized rice mill. \n \nB.  Long-Run Marginal Cost and Economic Subsidies \n11.  The Power Supply Tariff Study2 calculated the economic long-run marginal cost (LRMC) \nbased on the capital expenditure plan as agreed on by EdL and the Ministry of Industry and \nHandicrafts, which foresees a total investment of $730 million in 2001-2010. This ambitious plan \nreflects the Government's objective of increasing electricity coverage to 90% of households by \n2020. LRMC reflects the incremental costs of all adjustments in the system development plan \nand system operations that are attributable to an increase in demand sustained long into the \nfuture. As grid outreach is limited, LRMC will be expected to increase in the medium to long \nterm until a balance between power demand and supply is achieved. In other words, LRMC \nreflects the cost to the economy of connecting and supplying future customers, which provides \nan  indication  for  tariff-setting  principles.  If  tariffs  are  kept  below  the  average  LRMC,  the \neconomy as a whole subsidizes power consumption of those connected to the electricity grid at \nthe expense of those that are not.  \n \n12.  Effective 1 March 2002, the Government increased tariffs and rationalized the tariff \nstructure for domestic consumers by reducing tariff blocks to three and drastically increasing the \ntariff for the highest block. About 15% of sales occur in the lifeline block set at 50 kilowatt-hour \n(kWh)/month, thus protecting the poor consumers. In the same tariff order, the Government \nannounced that tariffs for all categories will increase by 2.3% per month over 36 months. The \nfollowing table compares projected average tariff levels with LRMC per customer category for \n2001\u20132004. \n \nTable A11.1: Long-Run Marginal Cost and Projected Average Tariffs  \nfor the Years 2001-2004 \n \n  2001   2002  2003   2004 \nCustomer  Tariff      LRMC  Tariff     LRMC  Tariff     LRMC  Tariff     LRMC \nCategory  (KN/kWh)  (KN/kWh)  (KN/kWh)  (KN/kWh) \nResidential  174  861  241  861  296  947  389  1,013 \nCommercial  386  727  488  727  638  800  838  856 \nGovt.

Table  A11.1  shows  that  no  customer  category  pays  the  full  cost  of  supply  and, \nconsequently, the system has no cross-subsidies. In 2004 tariffs for government offices and \n                                                 \n2  EdL. February 2002. Power Supply Tariff Study\u2014Final Report. \n ", "Appendix 11  55 \nmedium-voltage services customer will be slightly higher than their respective cost of supply. \nGiven the limited sales to those categories, the revenues will not be sufficient to cover the \nsubsidies extended to other consumers, although the average revenue increases from 29% of \nLRMC  to  53%.  Almost  all  domestic  consumption  is  subsidized  by  EdL\u2019s  export  earnings, \nreducing earnings. For FY2001 the economic subsidy\u2014the difference between LRMC and \nfinancial revenue\u2014amounts to KN350 billion. \n \n14.  All  customer  categories  are  subsidized,  but  the  greatest  subsidies  are  given  to \nresidential and irrigation customers who jointly account for about 72% of total sales. Given the \nhigh total domestic consumption at about 68% and the absence of time-of-day pricing or energy \nefficiency programs, the daily load curve peaks only once, for three hours, in the evening. As \nthe industrial load rises continuously, this pattern of use is expected to change, but not in the \nshort run. Since the system is entirely hydro based, the difference between the peak and off-\npeak marginal energy cost at bus bar is small, with KN286/kWh versus KN248/kWh. When \nincluding system losses, the difference between peak (KN404/kWh) and off-peak (KN313/kWh) \nmarginal  energy  cost  at  low-voltage  level  increases  visibly,  with  an  annual  average  of \nKN324/kWh. Current tariffs for residential and irrigation customers do even cover the off-peak \nenergy cost. Since class-specific load research has not been carried out in EdL, other countries\u2019 \nexperiences were used as a reasonable basis to estimate class coincidence and class load \nfactors to estimate marginal capacity cost and strict LRMC for each tariff class.  \n \n15.  While government subsidy of electricity consumption can be justified economically, the \nsubsidy budget should be calculated transparently. Current subsidies should also be assessed \nto see if they are sufficiently targeted and whether the intended beneficiaries are indeed \nreached or whether most subsidies go to customers able to pay. Moreover, the current subsidy \nstructure limits the ability of EdL reach the Government\u2019s 90% electrification target. \n \nC.   Economic Analysis \n \n16.  An economic evaluation was carried out for the entire Project, consisting of transmission \nand  distribution  investments.  The  results  are  summarized  below.  Details  of  the  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) calculations are in Table A11.2. \n \n17.  The vast majority of households in the Lao PDR have no access to grid electricity. \nHowever, province-sponsored systems and privately operated generators based on diesel or \nsmall hydro systems and imports from Thailand provide limited amounts of electricity. Thus, \neven  in  the  absence  of  grid  supply,  a  certain  amount  of  electricity  is  consumed  by  the \nresidential, industrial, and commercial sectors, albeit at substantially higher prices than paid by \nEdL customers. \n \n18.  The economic benefits of extending grid supply to unserved areas are estimated based \non the cost of alternative energy sources used for existing consumption levels, and based on \nthe willingness to pay for induced consumption as a consequence of the availability of reliable \ngrid supply. Benefits were estimated separately for poor and nonpoor residential consumers, \nand  for  industrial,  commercial,  and  irrigation  customers.  To  underline  the  differential  cost \nstructure of grid and off-grid supply, it is worth noting that in Louang Nam Thai, where a diesel \ngenerator produces electricity for about 4 hours/day, customers are asked to pay a tariff of \n1,200  KN/kWh,  while  in  Xaiboury  customers  are  required  to  pay  KN1,800/kWh,  and  in \nXaisomboun, KN2,000/kWh, for the same standard and quality of supply. In Pak Lai, where \npower  is  imported  from  Thailand,  connected  households  that  have  24-hour  supply  pay \nKN564/kWh. However, no new connections are possible in Pak Lai due to capacity constraints \n ", "56  Appendix 11 \nin  Thailand.  These  tariffs  must  be  compared  with  the  recently  announced  new  tariffs  of \nKN64/kWh for the first 50 kWh block of domestic consumption and KN150/kWh for the next \nblock of 50 kWh. Even after the recent tariff increase, none of the customer categories (except \nfor embassy and entertainment) pay a tariff equal to even the lowest tariff for off-grid supply, but \nthe highest EdL tariff (for the commercial category) equals only 83% of the rate charged to \ncustomers  in  Pak  Lai.  Neither  diesel  nor  kerosene  and  gasoline  are  subsidized,  so \nnonelectrified consumers are paying actual cost of supply for these energy sources.  \n \n19.  Unelectrified households typically get energy from four sources: (i) candles and simple \nkerosene or diesel lamps for lighting, (ii) dry-cell batteries for lighting and radio, (iii) car batteries \nfor televisions, and (iv) small diesel generators for most household and many commercial \nactivities. The economic value of electricity for domestic use was evaluated on the basis of a \ndemand curve consisting of the estimated costs of alternative sources of basic energy for \nlighting and induced demand for other uses at rates approaching the domestic tariff level. The \ncost of self-generation, and the tariff for off-grid supply are much higher than EdL\u2019s current and \nfuture tariffs. Not all domestic consumption will be so expensive, so only the initial portion of \ndomestic consumption is valued accordingly (replacement portion). Additional consumption has \ndecreasing marginal values until the lower limit for marginal consumption becomes almost equal \nto expected tariff levels (induced portion). \n \n20.  Derivations for the willingness-to-pay demand curve have been made for three different \ndomestic categories, and conservative assumptions have been used for all. For poor consumers \nthe initial point on the demand curve (44 kWh/year) has been valued as the cost of a small \nkerosene  lamp  (KN7,200/kWh).  For  nonpoor,  established  consumers,  the  initial  portion  of \nconsumption (560 kWh/year) has been valued as the cost of a small residential diesel generator \nat  KN2,480/kWh.  For  nonpoor,  first-time  consumers  the  initial  consumption  portion  (254 \nkWh/year) is valued as the average of the average initial tariff for off-grid electricity provision \nand the unit cost of small diesel generators, at KN2,019/kWh. The average willingness to pay \nfor the remaining area under the demand curve has been estimated at KN2,646/unit for poor \nand KN1,019/unit for nonpoor consumers.  \n \n21.  Estimated costs for private power supply for commercial customers are based on the \nuse of a 40 kW gas oil generator and a 35% load factor, and for industrial customers, on a 200 \nkW  gas  oil  generator,  also  with  a  35%  load  factor.  The  economic  replacement  cost  for \ncommercial customers is KN1,550/kWh, and for industrial consumers, KN1,140 kWh, while the \naverage  willingness  to  pay  for  induced  commercial  consumption  is  KN812/kWh,  and  for \nindustrial consumption, KN635/kWh. The cost of alternative energy sources for irrigation is \nbased on the estimated cost for diesel pumps with an 8-horsepower motor. The economic \nreplacement  cost  for  initial  consumption  is  estimated  at  KN1,935/kWh,  and  for  induced \nconsumption, at KN790/kWh.  \n \n22.  To convert financial project cost into economic cost, taxes and duties were deducted. No \nprice contingencies are included in the base capital cost but the economic capital costs include \nphysical contingencies. Costs were separated into foreign exchange and local costs, and a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to local costs. Annual operation and maintenance \ncosts were calculated in economic prices as a percentage of the total capital investment cost. \nThe economic cost includes provision for residential house wiring, which is excluded from \nfinancial  costs.  Energy  costs  have  been  valued  based  on  the  long-run  marginal  cost  for \ngeneration and transmission as  calculated by the recently completed Power Supply Tariff \n ", "Appendix 11  57 \nStudy.3 System losses were calculated for each feeder based on the estimated peak demand, \nand the load and loss factor and were included in estimation of energy costs. \n \n23.  On the basis of a comparison of economic costs and benefits over a 35-year project \nlifetime, including a 2-year construction period and excluding any residual value, the EIRR was \nestimated at 23.3%, with a net present value of KN356,168 million. Extensive sensitivity testing \nshows that the Project will remain robust for all 13 variables tested, with only minor impacts on \nthe EIRR (Table A11.3). The most significant impact resulted from a 20% reduction of total \nbenefits. The EIRR dropped to 18.3%. Risk analysis was undertaken by running simulations for \nthe energy input cost and for all seven willingness-to-pay values. The Project is very robust, with \nonly a 5% probability that the EIRR will drop below 13%. Distribution analysis (Supplementary \nAppendix C) for the Project shows that electricity customers and local labor are the main project \nbeneficiaries, whereas the return of the Project for the Government is negative. This is the result \nof the highly subsidized tariff structure, the cost of which is shared by the public utility, and thus \nthe Government, through lost tax income. The Project\u2019s poverty impact ratio (Supplementary \nAppendix C) is 10%, primarily due to the fact that the share of the poor in the overall loss to the \neconomy is higher than the benefits they receive as consumers  and project workers. Risk \nanalysis (Supplementary Appendix C) shows that the probability of the poverty impact ratio \nfalling below 5% is 5%. \n \nTable A11.2: Sensitivity Testing \n \nNPV  \nItem  Change  EIRR \n(in KN million) \nCapital Cost  20%  19.2  294,748 \n       \nEnergy Cost  LRMC + T  20.9  276,291 \n       \nBenefits  20%  18.3  146,060 \n       \nWillingness to Pay  Poor    Off-grid  21.8  275,094 \n  Non\u2013poor  Off-grid  20.1  247,671 \n  Commercial  Off-grid  24.3  388,028 \n  Irrigation  Off-grid  23.2  355,374 \n  Industry  Off-grid  24.0  377,052 \n  Other    Off-grid  24.0  377,354 \n     \nAlternative Fuel Cost not Updated  19.2  220,249 \n       \nDelays     1-year  21.7  309,973 \n      2-year  19.7  252,701 \nExchange Rate  11,000  20.55  304,850 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, KN = kip, LRMC = Long-run marginal cost, NPV = net present value,  \nT = transmission cost. \nSource: Staff estimates. \n                                                 \n3 Ibid. \n ", " \nTable A11.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n5\n8\n(KN million)    \n \nProject Benefits Project Costs A\nDomestic  Total  Transmission  Distribution House  Connection Energy Total Net pp\nNon-Poor Poor Comm Irrigation Industrial Others Benefits HV O&M MV O&M LV  Wiring Costs Costs Costs Benefits e\nn\nInvestment Investment Investment d\nix\n2004            -

Introduction \n1.  The project financial analysis from the perspective of Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) is based \non total project financial cost and additional revenue generated from new and incremental \nenergy sales. All revenue and costs are based on 2003 base figures. The Project is assumed to \noperate for 35 years, including the implementation period. This operating period corresponds to \nthe estimated useful life of the assets being constructed. No salvage value is assumed at the \nend of the operating period. \nB.  Capital Costs \n2.  Capital costs include transmission and substation costs (115.0 kilovolt [kV]), distribution \ncosts (34.5 kV and 22.0 kV), and low-voltage (400 volt [V]) costs of wiring to the external \nhousehold electricity meter. Investments in residential house wiring are the responsibility of the \nhouse owner and, therefore, excluded from this analysis. Capital costs include the base project \ncosts  plus  physical  contingencies  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during \nconstruction capitalized on the loan. The analysis assumes construction of 115 kV transmission \nlines in years 2 and 3 (2005-2006) and medium- and low-voltage distribution lines in years 3 \nand 4 (2006-2007). Household connections will start in 2006 and continue in the service areas \nthrough 2020. Capital costs associated with these connections are appropriately reflected. \nC.

The demand forecast is based on the forecast developed under the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance.1 Total expected sales are based on newly electrified customers in the \nproject  areas,  and  the  incremental  sales  in  Louang  Phrabang  resulting  from  additional \ntransmission capacity. The bulk of the energy demand forecast is for residential and commercial \nend users. Industrial demand from the prospective cement plant at Namo is forecast at 50% \ncapacity in 2010 and full capacity in 2020. Total energy demand is forecast from 2006 to 2020, \nwhen all incremental electricity usage and new connections from the Project are assumed to be \nfully realized. Sales revenue is based on demand forecast per customer category and reflects \nthe planned increase in retail tariffs from 2002 to 2005, which the Government approved in April \n2002 and implemented in May 2002 (2.3% per month for 36 months). The weighted average \nreal retail tariff for the project areas will be approximately KN612/kWh ($0.0526/kWh) in 2005, \nwhich is still below the long-run marginal costs but represent a significant step to cost recovery. \nTotal revenue also includes connection charges (meter, installation) paid by new customers. \nWhile customers may amortize connection charges under this Project, revenue accrues to EdL \nas services are performed. \nD.  Operation and Maintenance Costs \n4.  These costs include the cost of energy sent out to the transmission system, transmission \nand  distribution  losses,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs,  and  general  and \nadministrative expenses. The incremental financial cost of electricity generation is assumed at \nKN95/kWh ($0.01/kWh). Estimated costs for transmission and distribution losses have also \nbeen included in operating expenses. Based on EdL operating data from 2000, the average \nO&M cost per customer is KN235,000, which is assumed to stay constant as more customers \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to Lao PDR for the Northern Area Rural Power Distribution Project. Manila. \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \nare connected. Average administrative and staff costs are also based on 2000 operating data at \nKN72,000 per customer. \nE.  Turnover and Profit Tax \n5.  The Government charges EdL a 5% turnover tax on all domestic sales, which has been \nincluded in the financial analysis. EdL also pays profit tax of 35% on net income. If EdL\u2019s net \nincome  for  the  year  is  negative,  then  the  Government  assesses 1% on total turnover as \nminimum profit tax on EdL. \nF.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n6.  The  Project\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  comprises  three  financing \nsources: Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan,  Nordic Development Fund (NDF) loan, and \ngovernment counterpart funds (equity). The ADB and NDF loans are concessional (assuming a \nMinistry of Finance relending rate of 6%), so the real cost falls below the minimum rate test of \n4%. Individual real costs are shown in Table A12.1. \n7.  Determining the cost of EdL equity is complicated as debt and capital markets are \nunderdeveloped. The opportunity cost of government counterpart funds, in real terms, has been \ncalculated  according  to  the  following  methodology.  The  Government  does  issue  bonds \nperiodically (not at fixed intervals), but they may not be default free, so the dollar savings rate \noffered by the Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao at 6% for 1 year has been selected as \nthe risk-free equity rate of return.2 To this risk-free rate 4% has been added as an appropriate \npremium to reflect the volatile nature of inflation and financing using external currencies. After \nconverting this nominal rate into real terms, the opportunity cost of EdL funds has been \ncomputed to be 7.42%. \nTable A12.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \nMinimum  Composite  \nFinancing  Weighting \n  Real Cost  Rate Test  Capital Cost \n($ million)  (%) \n(%)  (%) \nADB Loan (Special Fund)  30.00   58.2  3.90%  4.00  2.33 \nNDF Loan  10.00   19.40  3.90%  4.00  0.78 \nEdL Equity  11.51   22.30  7.42%  \u2013  1.66 \n  51.51   100.00      4.77 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank, EdL = Electricit\u00e9 du Laos, NDF = Nordic Development Fund. \nG.  Results and Conclusions  \n8.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) on the Project is based on its capital and \nO&M costs and the revenue generated from new connections and incremental energy sales. \nThe project FIRR is 2.71%. The pro forma net annual revenues are generally positive and cover \nproject  operating  expenses.  However,  with  a  WACC  at  4.77%,  financial  returns  of  the \ninvestment do not exceed the total project financing cost.  \n9.  Although the Project\u2019s financial performance is marginal, its impact on EdL\u2019s operation is \nminimal compared to EdL\u2019s total domestic sales. Total projected energy sales from the project \nareas are only 8% of EdL\u2019s projected domestic turnover in 2010. A more meaningful measure of \nproject performance is the average cost recovery ratio (financial benefit-cost ratio). Based on \n                                                 \n2  Commercial banks in the Lao PDR do not offer savings rates longer than 1 year. As information was insufficient to \nreflect typical long-term cost of capital, the 1-year savings rate has been used. \n ", "Appendix 12  61 \nthe projected real tariffs in 2005, the Project\u2019s cost recovery ratio is 95%, which means that 95% \nof the Project\u2019s total capital and operating costs are recovered directly from sales revenue. \n10.  The main constraint is the current and projected level of retail tariffs, which do not yet \nfully recover the cost of service, especially for residential consumers. No real tariff increases \nhave been assumed in this base case beyond what has been approved and implemented in the \ncurrent tariffs (2.3% per month for 36 months, ending in mid-2005). These scheduled tariff \nincreases were adjusted to reflect real increases in 2003 terms. However, the Government \nshould continue to move to full cost recovery  long run marginal cost (LRMC) (calculation of \napproximately KN741/kwh in 2001) to ensure viability of future connections. For the Project to \nbe financially viable (FIRR exceeding WACC), EdL should continue to increase average tariffs \nby approximately 9% per year from 2006 to 2010. \n11.  A low FIRR raises the important question of how the Project can be sustainable so that \neconomic  benefits  materialize  and  accrue  to  the  targeted  beneficiaries.  Without  cross-\nsubsidization from other consumer groups, rural electrification is rarely financially viable in \ndeveloping member countries. While almost all consumer groups will be below the LRMC when \nconnections begin, the cross-subsidy needs to come from another source within EdL or directly \nfrom the Government. Current fiscal problems prevent an explicit subsidy transfer from the \nGovernment. EdL earns additional revenue (in dollars and baht) from exporting surplus energy \nto Thailand. Even as more energy is required domestically, exports to Thailand will remain a \nsignificant portion of EdL\u2019s turnover as new generation is commissioned and connected to EdL\u2019s \nsupply system. Export revenue boosts the finances of EdL, hedges a portion of its foreign \nexchange risks, and helps it meet its financial obligations to lenders and the Government. The \nrevenue is, in effect, a government subsidy to EdL for carrying out the Government\u2019s rural \nelectrification programs. Taking these into consideration, the Project will be sustainable despite \nits marginal financial performance. \n \n \n ", " \nTable A12.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) \n6\n2\n(All figures in KN million unless otherwise noted)   \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 1\n2\n \n ", "Appendix 13  63 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION  \n \n1.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Project was undertaken as part of the \nproject  feasibility  study.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B,  as  per \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB). The IEE is \nbased on an analysis of the impacts of the proposed works and a visual assessment of the \nproject areas. The IEE\u2019s main findings are summarized below. \nA.  Description of the Project \n2.  The Project will extend the transmission and distribution system in the northern rural \narea. Project details are given in the main text of the report. \nB.  Description of the Environment \n1.  Physical Resources \n3.  The northern provinces are predominantly steeply dissected hill country, ranging from \n320-meter (m) valley bottom areas such as Sayaburi and Louang Phrabang to over 2,000 m \nmountain ridges. About 85% of Louang Phrabang Province is cut into mountainous, as is \nOudomxai. The slopes of the lower hill zone are steep where tributaries have down V-shaped \nvalley bottoms. Upper hill slopes are less steep and more rounded. Large flat areas are rare, \noccasionally along the Mekong and other major rivers where valleys open up to allow river flood \nplains to develop. \n4.  The steep mountain slopes are particularly prone to erosion and mass wasting when \nvegetation is removed and soil exposed to rainfall and surface water flows. Water quality of \nmountain streams and rivers is generally quite high but can be rapidly degraded when soil that \nis eroded or wasted from exposed slopes enters the streams and increases turbidity, thereby \ndegrading water quality for aquatic organisms, and domestic and livestock consumption. \n5.  The climate is subtropical. The rainy season starts in April and ends in September or \nOctober, when the region receives 85\u201391% of its annual rainfall.  \n2.  Ecological Resources \n6.  The steep terrain of the northern region is part of an intricate system of streams and \nrivers that form the Mekong River watershed. No significant wetland areas exist aside from the \nnetwork of streams and rivers. Many villagers supplement their diets with fish, fresh water crabs, \nand other aquatic organisms caught from streams and ponds. \n7.  The latest satellite data of the northern provinces indicates that only 21% is covered by \nforest. Only small pockets of primary forest are left in the project area. The Government has \nestablished 20 national protected areas throughout the country. Provinces and districts have \nalso established a number of provincial protected areas and district protected areas (DPAs). \nHowever, their borders are often not clearly defined, and the protection level not defined. \n8.  Nam Phouy national protected area lies 5 kilometers (km) from the 22-kilovolt (kV) line \nbetween Xaibnabouli and Ban Namxong. Residents exploit the natural resources of the area, \nwhich is an important habitat for species such as the Asian elephant, tiger, gaur, Asian wild dog, \nand Asiatic black bear. \n ", "64  Appendix 13 \n3.  Human and Economic Development \n9.  Agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing  are  the  major  economic  sectors.  Rice  cultivation \noccupies about 80% of all agricultural land. Commercial crops include sugarcane, tea, coffee, \nsesame, and cotton. Nearly 90% of rural households raise livestock, including water buffaloes, \ncattle, pigs, and poultry, for household consumption and to sell. \n10.  Small- and medium-sized enterprises operate in the project area, including garment and \nfurniture factories; and agro-processing establishments, including distilleries, breweries, and \nmeat-processing factories. Phongsali and Sayaburi have sawmills with 50-200 employees each. \n11.  The Plain of Jars in Xieng Khouang is a world heritage site and major tourist attraction, \nas is the town of Louang Phrabang. \nC.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n12.  The following potentially significant impacts have been identified and their mitigation \nmeasures are available: \n1.  Natural Vegetation and Wildlife \n13.  The 115 kV lines will be sited to minimize impacts on natural resources. The Project will \nrely on existing roads for construction and maintenance. No new roads will be constructed, and \nonly small access tracks for light-duty vehicles will be needed at selected spots for construction \nand maintenance. Due to the poor habitat conditions and heavy human activity along the \nalignments, fauna and flora will not be significantly affected. The 34.5 and 22.0 kV distribution \nsystems will generally be situated within existing rights of way and, therefore, the impacts \ngenerated by the distribution network are much less significant than those of the 115.0 kV \nsystem. \n14.  Close attention will be paid to provincial protected areas, DPAs, and forests to avoid or \nminimize impacts on the environment. The alignment is planned along highways, where the \nenvironment has been degraded by human activities. Several provincial protected areas and \nDPAs are near the highways although they are not well demarcated, and two DPAs straddle the \nhighway in Oudomxai. During the detailed design survey, the alignment will be selected in close \nconsultation  with  local  forestry  officials  to  minimize  further  environmental  degradation.  If \nsecondary or plantation forest needs to be cut, it will be done in close consultation with the \nDepartment  of  Forestry.  Compensation  will  be  paid  according  to  Lao  Forestry  Law  and \nregulations for compensatory planting. In dissected or steeply undulating areas, clearing of the \nright of way will not be necessary where the tops of the highest trees are a safe distance from \nthe conductor. To avoid possible wildlife poaching by construction contractors, project staff and \nwork crews will not be allowed to possess firearms or animal traps. \n15.  EdL will maintain the corridor by manually trimming vegetation not by using herbicide. \nVegetation beneath the transmission lines will be maintained in an early seral stage to provide \nminimum clearance of 10 meters from the conductors. \n16.  The Project will involve only minimal excavation that could contribute to soil erosion and \nsedimentation of water sources.  \n ", "Appendix 13  65 \n2.  Land Use and Resettlement \n17.  During selection of the alignments, efforts were made to avoid existing settlements; \nprivate and community structures; agricultural land; mature forest; areas of social, historical, and \ncultural  value;  and  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  During  the  detailed  alignment  survey, \nvillagers along the route will be consulted. The potential for resettlement is minimal, and a short \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement. The resettlement plan will be updated after detailed project design, and approved \nby ADB before implementation.  \n3.  Health and Safety \n18.  Main health risks during construction may arise from (i) inadequate sanitation facilities in \nworkers\u2019 camps, (ii) introduction of sexually transmitted or other diseases by immigrant workers, \n(iii) outbreaks of malaria in the labor force, and (iv) explosion of unexploded ordnance (UXO). \nTo avoid these risks (i) the contractor will prepare a worker health and safety plan, (ii) workers \nwill  receive  health  and  safety  training,  (iii)  workers  will  undergo  pre-employment  health \nscreening, and (iv) UXO will be cleared before construction. Local villagers will also receive \nhealth education. \n4.  Encroachment on Historical and Cultural Sites \n19.  The project area encompasses two world heritage sites: the Plain of Jars and the town \nof Louang Phrabang. The transmission lines will avoid them. \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n20.  Throughout project implementation, EdL will be responsible for ensuring that the Project \nfully  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  and  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental regulations, and meet the IEE\u2019s mitigation and monitoring requirements. Project \nbudget will be set aside to implement the mitigation measures to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. EdL will \nestablish a project environmental management office  consisting of a representative of EdL\u2019s \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Management  Office,  the  contractor,  and  relevant  government \nministries, especially the Science, Technology, and Environment Agency (STEA), to ensure \nimplementation of the environmental management plan and monitoring.  \n21.  The environmental management office will prepare monthly environmental management \nreports for submission to EdL, and the reports will be sent to other ministries and STEA for \nreview and inspection. EdL also will prepare quarterly summaries for inclusion in the quarterly \nprogress report to ADB. \nE.  Findings and Recommendations \n22.  The  environmental  screening  process  for  the  Project  was  adequate.  Overall \nenvironmental impacts are deemed to be minor because of the following: \n(i)  Careful consideration has been given to route selection to avoid environmentally \nsensitive areas and areas of social, historical, and cultural value. \n(ii)  Two  households  might  be  resettled.  If  they  are,  they  will  be  adequately \ncompensated. \n(iii)  Measures  are  readily  available  to  mitigate  potential  impacts,  with  adequate \nmonitoring. \n ", "66  Appendix 13 \nF.  Conclusions \n23.  Compensatory  and  mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  to  address  potential \nimpacts. The IEE, therefore, is sufficient and, with the recommended environmental monitoring \nprogram,  is  the  completed  environmental  assessment  report  for  the  Project.  No  further \nassessment is needed and the Project will expect minor impacts that can be mitigated. \n \n ", "Appendix 14  67 \nSUMMARY SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN \nA.  Scope of the Resettlement Plan \n1.  A social analysis carried out in the project area concluded that the Project would require \nminimal land acquisition and resettlement. A short resettlement plan has been prepared for the \nProject  in  compliance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement and the Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. The only project \nsites that can be identified are for the substations. Transmission and distribution line alignments \ncannot be identified until after detailed design. However, as alignments will be selected to avoid \nall but two possible houses, and most, if not all, residential and agricultural land, land acquisition \nimpact will be insignificant. The resettlement plan will be updated following detailed design and \nsubmitted to ADB for approval before implementation. \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n2.  The  115-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  alignments  will  be  sited  to  avoid,  wherever \npossible, crossing villages and other settlement areas as well as agricultural land and trees. \nOnly restricted land use for agriculture will be permitted below the 115 kV lines. Transmission \nline towers will also be situated to avoid agricultural land. The number and location of towers will \nbe determined during detailed design. Each landowner will lose only a small area for a tower \nand will be able to cultivate under the transmission lines and towers. The Project will not have a \npermanent adverse effect on livelihood or income. Farmers will be able to continue growing their \ncrops under the transmission lines and towers. Approximately 5 hectares (ha) of land will be \nrequired for permanent acquisition for three substations on scrubland  belonging to the local \ngovernment or Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL), and private scrubland (0.25 ha) will be acquired for \none \u201cT\u201d tap junction.1 Only two houses on 0.25 ha of land in the proposed alignment of the Nam \nNgum to Thalat 115 kV transmission line may be affected. If they are, they will be able to move \nwithin  500  meters  (m).  Land  may  also  be  required  temporarily  for  access  tracks.  The \nconstruction of distribution systems to provide electricity to villages will not require any land \nacquisition or displacement of households, although trees and structures will be restricted to 3 \nm. Electric poles and lines will be located adjacent to existing roads between villages, and in \nvillages, along roads and pathways. Living close to 22.0 kV and 34.5 kV power lines does not \npose a health hazard. Land acquisition requirements for each project component are identified \nin the resettlement plan.  \nC.  Policy Framework \n3.  The policy framework and entitlements have built principally on the Constitution and \nLand Law, national policy on resettlement and compensation, decree on resettlement and \ncompensation,  and  implementation  regulations  for  project-related  resettlement  and \ncompensation.2 The Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts (MIH) has decided to follow these \nimplementation  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  and  government-\napproved resettlement plans for other ADB and World Bank projects. \n                                                 \n1  A \u201cT\u201d-shaped junction where a new transmission line is connected to an existing line to tap power supply. \n2  The  draft  policy,  decree,  and  implementation  regulations  have  all  been  prepared  under  ADB  Loan  1867: \nEnvironment and Social Program, for $30 million, approved 6 December 2001 and TA 3746. The final documents \nwas approved by the Government in May 2003. \n ", "68  Appendix 14 \nD.  Resettlement Principles and Objectives \n4.  The following are the key principles and objectives adopted for electricity projects and \nwill be applied to this Project: \n(i)  Involuntary displacement will be avoided or minimized wherever possible by \nexploring all viable alternative project designs and locations. \n(ii)  Land acquisition and resettlement will be planned and implemented to cause the \nleast possible social, cultural, and economic disruption. \n(iii)  Affected people will be \n(a)  compensated as per the compensation principles below; \n(b)  helped to move, if required, during the transition period to the relocation \nsite; and  \n(c)  helped to improve their living standards there. \n(iv)  Livelihoods will be restored without detriment to the environment. \n(v)  Cultural and religious practices will be respected and, as much as possible, \npreserved. \n(vi)  Special measures will protect socially and economically vulnerable groups such \nas ethnic  minorities, woman-headed families, children and the aged without \nsupport structures, and extremely poor people. \n(vii)  All people residing, cultivating, or making a living within the project areas before \na formally recognized cut-off date will be considered as affected people and \nentitled to resettlement and rehabilitation assistance to help them improve or at \nleast maintain their pre-project living standards, income-earning capacity, and \nproduction levels. Lack of legal titles to the land a person is cultivating or to the \nplace of residence will not be a bar to resettlement entitlements. \n(viii)  Replacement residential and agricultural land will be as close as possible to the \nland that was lost, and acceptable to the affected persons. \n(ix)  Temporarily affected land and communal infrastructure will be restored to pre-\nproject condition. \n(x)  The compensation and resettlement activities will be satisfactorily completed and \nrehabilitation measures in place for a contract. The contract area will be free of \nencumbrances before ADB approves the award of the contract for civil works. \n(xi)  The previous level of community services and resources will be improved after \nresettlement. \n(xii)  A project-affected person will not be dispossessed of his or her property nor \ndisplaced from his or her place of residence or employment without payment of \nfull  compensation  and/or  without  making  arrangements  for  relocation  and \nrehabilitation. \n(xiii)  EdL will see that institutional arrangements are in place to ensure effective and \ntimely  design,  planning,  consultation,  and  implementation  of  the  short \nresettlement plan. \n(xiv)  The entire cost of the resettlement program will be considered as an integral part \nof the project cost and budgeted in annual and overall project implementation \nplans. \n(xv)  The resettlement programs will be planned and implemented with the consent \nand agreement of the affected people and host population and will encourage \ntheir active participation. A full participatory public involvement process will be \nimplemented. \n ", "Appendix 14  69 \n(xvi)  After detailed project design and identification of affected persons, details of the \nupdated resettlement plan will be disclosed to them in a form and manner that \nthey can understand. \n(xvii)  The  district  authorities  will  establish  a  grievance  committee  to  include \nrepresentatives of MIH and EdL, a representative of the Ministry of Agriculture \nand Forestry at the provincial level, district and village representatives such as \nthe headman and chief elders, representatives of local organizations such as the \nLao Women\u2019s Union, and representatives of affected households other than the \nvillage heads. The committee will not be dominated by organizations that have a \ndirect interest in project implementation (such as MIH and EdL). Each committee \nmember will receive an honorarium per case reviewed. \nE.  Entitlement Matrix \n5.  The summary entitlement matrix (Table A14) summarizes the main types of losses and \nsupport for each type.

Institutional Framework \n6.  EdL  established  the  Environmental  and  Social  Management  Office  to  monitor \nresettlement  plan  implementation.  The  office  is  staffed  by  an  experienced  environmental \nspecialist manager, and three other environmental specialists and one social specialist, but \nneeds more qualified social and environmental expertise. The Project will help EdL recruit and \ntrain one more social development and one rural development specialist. \nG.  Preliminary Compensation Budget \n7.  An  amount  of  $250,000  has  been  estimated  for  compensation  and  resettlement \nactivities. The Government will ensure that it meets any budget shortfall needed to meet the \nresettlement plan objectives, once the resettlement plan is updated. \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n8.  The preparation and implementation of the updated resettlement plan will be monitored \nby the Environmental and Social Management Office with help from the consultants. They will \nmaintain a database of resettlement monitoring information. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 15  71 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national  Sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \nYes  partnership agreement? Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR): \n \n1.  The poor in the Lao PDR are heavily burdened by lack of access to modern energy. Poor women are particularly \naffected as they are responsible for food processing. They spend a large proportion of scarce household cash \nincome on alternative but less efficient sources of energy, are exposed to inadequate and smoky lighting, have \nlittle access to information, have little social activity, and spend long hours producing manual energy. Vaccines, \nmedication, and animal vaccines cannot be stored nearby. Children have less time for studying. People feel \nunsafe at night. Fuel poverty particularly affects the poor because their cash income is scarce, their workload is \nheavy, and opportunity cost of time high. Inadequate and expensive sources of energy affect reduce the poor\u2019s \nability to diversify livelihood and income activities. Access to modern energy will significantly reduce the \nvulnerability of poor households; reduce their expenditure on energy; improve their quality of life; provide \nincreased access to information; and help reduce workload, especially for women. \n \n2.  Access to modern sources of energy and the grid in particular is also an equity issue. Access to the grid means \naccess to subsidized energy. Most of the poor do not have access to the grid and, thus, indirectly pay for \nsubsidies that do not benefit them. The poor with no access spend more on energy than the nonpoor. Grid \nexpansion and connecting the poor will substantially reduce these inequities.  \n \n3.  Electricity is a key input to food processing and small-scale enterprise development. Reliable electricity supply \nwill reduce barriers to expand and enhance productivity. Increased rural commercial activity is key to reduce \npoverty. Improved electricity supply will lift a significant constraint on economic growth and enable the poor to \ncapture the benefits of economic growth.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis Classification: Poverty Intervention \nPoverty Profile: \n \n4.  The poverty profile is based on district poverty data from the latest Lao expenditure consumption survey \n(1997/98). The estimated poverty incidence among targeted beneficiaries is 43.4%. Poor households make up \n41.5% of the total. Nearly 60% of the project beneficiaries are poor, compared to 39% of the total population. \nMost of the poor in the project area are ethnic minorities. Na Mo is one of the poorest districts, with the poor \nmaking up more than 92% of the population. \n \nConnecting the Poor: \n \n5.  To ensure that they can fully benefit from rural electrification and existing power subsidies, the poor need to have \ndirect access to the grid. Investments in the sector, therefore, should be targeted at the poor. However, targeting \ninvestments may be inefficient if barriers prevent poor households from directly accessing electricity. For \ninstance, if the poor are unable to connect, they will not be able to save on expenditures. As the sector contains \nsignificant subsidies, an important aspect is the inability to target subsidies when the poor are excluded from \naccess. This has strong distributional effects. If the sector is to become more pro-poor, barriers must be brought \ndown. Two up-front barriers were identified as potentially reducing the poverty impact of the Project and of future \ninvestments.  \n \n6.  The first barrier is the policy of cost sharing, where the village contributes 30% of the low-voltage distribution \ncosts. This was found to have two apparent effects. First, cost sharing burdens poor more than nonpoor villages. \nAs poor villages are more remote and have fewer households (including those who can afford to pay), they pay \nmore per capita than nonpoor villages in less remote areas. Second, poor villages may be deterred entirely from \nconnecting because it is unaffordable. Thus, none of the potential poverty impacts of investments in the sector \nwould be realized. The Fact-Finding Mission found that Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) was already having difficulty \ncollecting village contributions. MIH and EdL recognized the inequity of the policy and abolished cost sharing \npolicy.  \n \n7.  The second barrier to access included the lump-sum up-front charges for connection paid by individual \nhouseholds. While the poor may still indirectly benefit in many ways from electrification, poverty impacts will not \nbe fully realized if the poor are deprived of the most immediate and direct impact of expenditure savings. The \n ", "72  Appendix 15 \nbe fully realized if the poor are deprived of the most immediate and direct impact of expenditure savings. The \nFact-Finding Mission\u2019s findings confirm that poor households in electrified villages are either not connected or \nconnect through shared (illegal) connections, and charged a substantially higher flat rate per kilowatt-hour. Thus, \neven if poor households are connected, they still do not fully benefit from sector subsidies. Most households in \nelectrified areas were able to pay the initial up-front charges by selling cattle or borrowing from relatives. No \ncredit, beyond borrowing from relatives, was available. Some individuals had managed to negotiate with EdL \nstaff to be allowed to amortize the payment. However, the poor are less able to negotiate amortization than the \nnonpoor. The poor said they would connect if up-front charges could be paid over a longer time. Therefore, \nformalizing amortization was found to be a viable option to connect poor households. \n \n8.  Under EdL\u2019s new connection policy, wiring from the pole to the house and inside wiring have been handed over \nto the private sector1. The connection fee, cost for installation and material, administration charges, and meter \ndeposit are charged by EdL. It has agreed to offer new consumers the option of amortizing their share of the up-\nfront charges over up to 12 months. This option will apply to residential consumers with 3-ampere connections.2 \nTo ensure consistency of business practices across branch offices, the amortization will apply to all new \nconsumers and not limited to consumers connected under ADB-supported projects. The private sector is \nexpected to provide credit to households unable to pay in lump sum. This will ensure some economies of scale in \nproviding wiring to villages connected to the grid. However, EdL should carefully monitor private sector services \nto ensure that they are affordable, of good quality, and safe. \n \nExpected Impacts on the Poor: \n \n9.  The most immediate and direct impact of providing reliable electricity services to the poor is expenditure savings \non energy (Table A15). \n \nTable A15: Immediate Impact on Poor Households: Cash Savings  \n(average KN/month) \n \n    Initial HH     \nHH Diesel  Electricity  Share of HH Cash  Share of Total HH Expenditure \nExpenditure  expenditure  Income (%)  (%) \nLocation  @ 3 liters/    Non-      \nmonth  @ 4 kWh  electrified  Electrified  Non-electrified  Electrified \nLess remote  10,500  319  14.1  0.43  7.4  0.23 \nIntermediate  12,000  319  16.1  0.43  8.5  0.23 \nremote \nVery remote  13,500  319  18.1  0.43  9.5  0.23 \nConsumption  @    1740    2.3    1.2 \n20 kWh \nHH = household, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Lao National Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2 1997/98. \nCalculations based on average cash income and expenditure of poor households for the country as a whole. \nCost and consumption data are based on findings from field visits. \n \n10. The poor spend 14-18% of their cash income on unreliable and poor-quality energy for lighting. Access to \nreliable grid supply of electricity would significantly reduce cash expenditure to well below 1% of cash income or \ntotal household expenditure. Most rural poor households have a high degree of subsistence with scarce cash \nincome. The fungibility of available cash will divert household expenditure to other items and change household \nexpenditure patterns. As households are able to diversify livelihoods and earn cash, appliances will become \naffordable and demand for electricity expand for other purposes than lighting. Poor households increase their \nconsumption sharply during the first 2 years of connection. Consumption levels for poor households will likely be \naround 20-50 kWh per month, with expenditure shares at about 2-4% of cash income.  \n \n11. Another significant economic effect on poor households of providing electricity to villages is the reduction of food-\nprocessing costs. Most villages have rice mills operating on diesel, the high cost of which is transferred to \nconsumers, which may deter the poor from using modern rice processing, leave them with manual processing \nmethods, and ultimately raise food prices. The cost of food processing would be expected to decrease as a \nresult of village electrification whether the poor household is electrified or not. As poor households spend a \nhigher share of their expenditure on food (the sum of own produce and purchased food) than nonpoor, a \nreduction in food prices would disproportionately benefit the poor.  \n                                                 \n1 An exception to the new policy is connections for shield wiring along transmission lines where EdL will complete all \nconnection tasks. \n2  Poor households are unlikely to connect to loads above 3 amperes. \n ", "Appendix 15  73 \nreduction in food prices would disproportionately benefit the poor.  \n \n12. Analysis of poor households\u2019 expenditure patterns suggests that they are affected by electrification. A simple \nregression model gave the following results:  \n \nln(food expenditure/total expenditure)=3.80*-0.080* el+0.059* ln(per capita expenditure)+0.07*Region \nR2=0.24, n=3391 \n(* Denotes statistical significance at 0.01 level) \n \nAlthough  this  simple  model  may  only  explain  a  part  of  expenditure  patterns,  the  results  suggest  that \nelectrification reduces food expenditure shares by 8% when controlling for household per capita expenditure and \nregional differences. On average non-electrified poor households spend 76% of their total expenditure on food, \ncompared with 64% for electrified poor households, which may be a result of a combined effect of increased \nincomes and a reduction of food prices. Food prices are expected to go down due to more efficient food \nprocessing. \n \n13. Other impacts of electrification on the poor include increased social activity; more access to information and \nenjoyment from television; ability of children to study at night; and ability to better store vaccines, other \nmedications, and animal vaccines. Electrification will significantly reduce the workload for women and give them \ntime for other activities. Data suggest that women\u2019s time spent on food processing will be reduced from 14 to 5 \nhours if electricity is available, significantly benefiting women\u2019s health. While many of these social benefits are \ndifficult to quantify and are subjective opinions of the poor, they do reflect improvements in the quality of life and \nare equally important to expenditure savings. Many of the social benefits occur on the village level and are \n\u201cpublic goods.\u201d Thus they do not exclude unconnected households in electrified villages.  \n \nAffordability of Tariff Increases: \n \n14. The Government has agreed to maintain a lifeline tariff at consumption levels below 50 kWh, well within the \nrange of consumption levels of poor households. In general, the poor\u2019s consumption is determined by the \naffordability of appliances, and prices are relatively inelastic at these low levels of consumption. Therefore, the \npoor can be expected to maintain their consumption at a basic-needs level even as tariffs increase. At a \nconsumption of 50 kWh per month a poor household would, assuming initial levels of income or expenditure, \nspend 5.8% of cash income or 3.1 % of total expenditure on electricity. While this is affordable, incomes are \nlikely to increase as a result of electrification, and the share spent on electricity would be even lower. Average \nper capita cash income earnings (excluding remittances and pensions to reflect income potential) is about 3.4 \ntimes higher for electrified than non-electrified poor households, suggesting that the share spent on electricity \nwould be about 2%.  \n \n15. Assuming no sector subsidies and an increase in the lifeline tariff to cost recovery level (from 87 KN/kWh to 947 \nKN/kWh), the share of cash income spent on electricity would be 7% for 20 kWh per month and 18% for 50 kWh. \nAt the initial consumption level of 4 kWh per month the share would be 1.5%. Differences in total expenditure of \nelectrified and non-electrified households is negligible. The corresponding expenditure shares for electricity \nwould be 2% at 4kWh, 13% at 20 kWh, and 33% for 50 kWh. Thus, while tariff increases are affordable for the \npoor, cost recovery tariffs at these low levels of consumption will probably not be sustainable. As the poor \nconsume so little, a well-targeted lifeline would be affordable.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n16. Stakeholder analysis prepared.
