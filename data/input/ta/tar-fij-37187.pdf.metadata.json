In  April  2004,  during  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  Mission,  the \nGovernment of the Fiji Islands requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance \n(TA)  to  prepare  the  Rural  and  Outer  Islands  Development  Project.  The  ADB  Fact-Finding \nMission visited the Fiji Islands from 21 to 24 March 2005, and reached an agreement with the \nGovernment  on  the  TA\u2019s  rationale,  objective,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services.  The  project \npreparatory TA design is based on the Mission's discussions with the Government; observations \nin the field; and a review of data, studies, and reports. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Fiji Islands\u2019 320 islands are scattered across 150,000 square kilometers in the \nSouth Pacific Ocean. About 75% of the population of 825,000 lives on the main islands of Viti \nLevu and Vanua Levu, and the remaining reside in about 106 small scattered outer islands \nincluding the Gau, Kadavu, Koro, Lau group, Taveuni, and Yasawa group. Most of the smaller \nouter islands are sparsely populated\u2014many with only a few hundred people\u2014and isolated.  \n \n3.  While the Fiji Islands\u2019 overall socioeconomic condition has improved significantly over \nthe last three decades, considerable disparities still exist in terms of economic development and \ndistribution of wealth and benefits between the main population centers and the remote rural \nareas and outer islands. Currently, economic activities are concentrated around the urban \ncenters and the sugarcane-growing areas of the main islands, and there is a large income \ninequality between urban and rural areas and between the main islands and outer islands. \nIndications  are  that  this  income  inequality  is  increasing.  With  limited  income-earning \nopportunities  in  remote  rural  and  outer  island  areas,  which  have  been  traditionally  on \nsubsistence economy, the gap between those in cash and those in subsistence economy \nwidens. As a result, in the Lau Group of Islands, the Gini averaged just over 0.3 compared with \n0.46 nationally.2  \n \n4.  Political instability in the past has been directly linked to income inequality and poor \neconomic growth. Lack of institutional capability at local level in the remoter areas has also \nresulted  in  poor  delivery  of  services  and  income-earning  opportunities.  Thus,  improving \ngovernance by strengthening local capacity is key to efficient delivery of services and poverty \nreduction. Further, to improve the rural and outer islands economy, involving the private sector \nin feasible areas is critical.   \n \n5.  Rural and outer islands development is crucial to promoting balanced development of \nremote communities. The outer islands possess natural resources, including forestry, fishery, \nand agriculture, and have good tourism potential. Subsistence agriculture is the mainstay of the \neconomy of the rural and outer islands. However, most people depend on copra and kava for \ncash income. Tourism is an important growth industry and revenue earner in some islands, such \nas  Kadavu  and  Taveuni,  where  the  combination  of  natural  beauty  and  traditional  lifestyle \nprovides much of interest to foreign tourists. Trade between islands is dominated by copra and \nother  basic  household  items.  In  most  areas,  goods  are  transported  to  small  islands  by \ninterisland or coastal vessels. In some islands, high-value commodities, such as kava, are \ntransported by air. There is potential for private sector led joint ventures with local entrepreneurs \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 29 March 2005. \n2   Abbott, David and Steve Pollard. 2004.

Recent market \nprojections indicate a steady growth in the tourism sector, which will also lead to demand for \nlocal fruits, vegetables, fish and other marine products. Previous lack of economic opportunities \nhas resulted in a low level of skills in the remote communities, including technical, managerial, \nand entrepreneurial skills. Development of such skills will be essential to enabling the people to \ntake advantage of new opportunities. \n \n6.  The  remote  areas  have  tremendous  potential  for  tourism,  marine,  and  agriculture \ndevelopment; however, because of the lack of investment in physical infrastructure development \nand income-earning opportunities over the years, people have migrated towards the urban \ncenters in the main islands. This has placed a severe strain on the urban centers, with ever-\ngrowing squatter settlements and the associated social problems. The remote communities, \nespecially in the outer islands, face chronically inadequate water supply and storage, poor road \naccess, irregular shipping and air services, poor telecommunications, lack of electricity and \nother basic services, and limited income-generating opportunities due to poor market access \nand high transportation costs. Existing infrastructure facilities, such as jetties, rural roads, small \nfish and agriculture processing facilities, were mostly built between the mid-1960s and 1980s, \nbut since then the lack of investment has severely hampered growth.3 Although the country\u2019s \nshipping and air services network is generally quite well developed, services to many outer \nislands are often nonviable and therefore irregular. This presents a major challenge.  \n \n7.  The Government recognizes the need to improve intra-island infrastructure, including \ntransportation and communication, to facilitate growth, but so far there is little investment in \nrehabilitation and upgrading of basic facilities in the outer islands. The Strategic Development \nPlan  2003\u22122005,  and  the  20\u2212year  Development  Plan  (2001\u22122020),  emphasize  reducing \ndisparities between the main island and outer islands through systematic development and \nimplementation of programs, including basic social services, related infrastructure, and income-\nearning  opportunities  to  reduce  poverty.  The  Government  is  keen  on  formulating  various \ndevelopment programs to improve and balance economic growth and to promote rural and outer \nislands development.  \n \n8.  There is an immediate need to improve landing facilities (ship docks, small jetties, boat \nchannels); expedite loading and unloading; and reduce cargo spoilage, passenger discomfort, \nand injury. Warehousing, mainly for copra but also for general inward cargo, and improvements \nto road tracks are needed to concentrate on copra collection and distribution of inward cargo at \nselected loading points. Navigation aids to enable access to landing points under low-light \nconditions at night and extensions and general improvements to selected airstrips are essential. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  the  Fiji  Islands  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s \nobjectives and includes (i) promoting maximum use of the region\u2019s potential, (ii) supporting \ninfrastructure  and  commercial  development  and  investment  in  rural  areas,  (iii)  maintaining \neffective  social  services,  (iv)  encouraging  active  community  participation,  (v)  improving \ncoordination and effectiveness of local administration, and (vi) reducing economic and social \ndisparities  between  regions.  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  identified  improvement  of  physical \ninfrastructure as a priority area to support the strategic objectives, together with complementary \nassistance  for  rural  livelihoods  and  outer  islands  development.  Over  the  medium  term,  to \npromote growth, ADB will continue to emphasize improvement of the policy environment, and \ngiven  the  perennial  shortage  of  skills,  place priority  on  human  resource  development  and \ninstitutional strengthening of key sector agencies, and promote private sector development. \n \n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2004.

The  project  preparatory  TA  will  help  the  Government  develop  and  assist  balanced \nregional development and reduce poverty. An initial poverty and social analysis is shown in \nAppendix 2. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project preparatory TA is to help the Government design an investment project to \nimprove income-earning opportunities and reduce economic disparities in the rural and outer \nislands\u2014the eastern and central divisions of the Fiji Islands. The proposed project will support \nthe Government's objectives of balanced regional development and distribution of economic \nopportunities to all parts of the Fiji Islands.  \n \n12.  The output of the TA will be a detailed feasibility study for financing by ADB covering the \nscope; detailed costs; implementation arrangements; and analysis of the economic, social, \nenvironmental, institutional, and key sectors. The TA will (i) identify potential income-generating \nopportunities and priority infrastructure to support development, (ii) identify potential for private-\nsector  collaboration  with  island  communities  to  develop  locally  available  resources  in  a \nsustainable  and  equitable  manner,  and  (iii)  evaluate  policy  and  institutional  constraints \nimpacting outer islands development. Special attention will be paid to the needs of women and \nyouth to identify income-earning opportunities for such groups.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will be undertaken in two phases, using a full participatory approach. During the \nfirst  phase  (3  months),  the  consultant  team  will  (i)  review  the  wide  range  of  problems \nconstraining  rural  and  outer  islands  development,  including  institutional  capacity,  current \npolicies,  legislation,  and  role  and  performance  of  different  agencies;  (ii)  assess  scope  for \npotential  development;  (iii)  undertake  wide  stakeholder  consultations  and  social,    poverty, \nenvironmental,  and  other  necessary  surveys;  (iv)  evaluate  the  impact  of  existing  ongoing \nprograms; (v) identify potential income-generating opportunities in different areas and sectors, \nbased  on  each  island\u2019s  natural  advantage  and  endowment,  and  the  necessary  support, \nincluding access to credit, market, processing, storage, and others; (vi) identify the necessary \ninfrastructure to support economic development, including small jetties, rural roads, and other \nbasic  facilities;  and  (vii)  assess  the  capacity  and  potential  of  the  private  sector  to  build \npartnerships  with  local  groups  to  participate  in  development  and  service  delivery.  Active \nconsultations will be undertaken with the central, provincial, and local governments, community \ngroups, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n \n14.  During the second phase (2 months), the team, in consultation with the stakeholders, will \nprepare a comprehensive feasibility report. The report will cover in detail the components\u2014 \nfinancial, economic, social, and environmental; relevant sector analysis; role and institutional \ncapacity of key stakeholders; appropriate procurement and implementation arrangements; and \nthe cross-cutting issues of poverty reduction, gender, good governance, and private sector \ndevelopment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  to  be  US$994,000  equivalent,  comprising \nUS$525,000  in  foreign  exchange  and  US$469,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The \n ", "4   \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance US$700,000 equivalent to meet the entire foreign \nexchange cost of US$525,000 and US$175,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance \nthe balance of the local currency cost of US$294,000 equivalent by providing counterpart staff, \nsupport services, and office facilities. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown \nin Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Sugar, and Land Resettlement (MASLR)4, the Executing \nAgency (EA) for the TA, will coordinate closely with the Ministry of Finance and National \nPlanning (MOFP), Ministry of Regional Development (MRD), Ministry of Fisheries and Forests, \nand Ministry of Works and Energy (MWE). MASLR will appoint a counterpart TA manager, and \nMOFP and MRD will also appoint counterpart staff for coordination between the Government, \nother stakeholders, and ADB consultants. A TA steering committee will be established and \nchaired by the chief executive officer of MASLR; it will also include senior representatives from \nMRD, MOFP, MWE, Ministry of Public Enterprises, Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, \nPrime Minister\u2019s Office, and other relevant agencies. The steering committee will meet monthly \nto guide and support the TA team in the project preparation and also report regularly on the \nprogress of the TA to the Cabinet subcommittee on agriculture.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented in two phases (paras. 13\u221214), over a 5\u2212month period, \ncommencing around June 2005 and ending in October 2005. Substantial time will be devoted to \nfield work, including stakeholder consultations and workshops. The consultant team will prepare \nan inception report within 2 weeks of commencement of field activities, and a midterm progress \nreport at the end of the third month. A draft final report, in the format of a detailed feasibility \nreport,  will  be  submitted  5  months  after  commencement  of  services.  Before  phase  2 \ncommences, 1 month is allowed to incorporate the decisions and views from the stakeholders to \nensure ownership. The inception, midterm, and draft final reports will be subject to tripartite \nreviews by the Government, ADB and the consultants. \n \n18.  About 17 person-months of international and 10 person-months of domestic consultants \nwill  be  required;  consultants  must  have  experience  in  rural  development,  agriculture, \ninfrastructure, credit, economics, finance, environmental, and social assessment. To meet the \nGovernment\u2019s  urgent  request  for  early  project  processing,  the  consultant  services  will  be \nprovided by a team of individual consultants recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and \nengagement of domestic consultants. The outline of the consultants\u2019 terms of reference is in \nAppendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of US$700,000 on a grant basis \nto the Government of the Fiji Islands for preparing the Rural and Outer Islands Development \n \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n4  MASLR is also the Executing Agency for the Alternative Livelihoods Development Project, approved on 28 March \n2005. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5\n DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets  Reporting Mechanisms Risks \n     \nImpact       \nImproved income- Demonstrable  National budget, national   \nearning opportunities in  contribution from outer  economic and poverty   \nthe rural and outer  islands to economic  statistics   \nislands    growth   \n    Household and income \n  expenditure surveys \nOutcome       \nThe Rural and Outer  Memorandum of  Project progress reports   \nIslands Development  Understanding signed by  and ADB review \nProject feasibility study  the Government and  missions \nand design for  Asian Development Bank   \nimproving income  (ADB)   \nopportunities in the     \nrural and outer islands     \ncomprising the eastern   \nand central divisions of \nthe Fiji Islands \nOutputs (of the       \nTechnical Assistance)      Assumptions \n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national policy in   Sector identified as a national priority in  \ncountry poverty analysis?  Yes.  country poverty partnership agreement? Yes. \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reducing poverty in the Fiji Islands: \n \nMore than half the people live in rural areas, and agriculture is the mainstay of the economy in terms of production \nvalue, employment and income generation, and subsistence. Some 25% households, or about 200,000 people, live \nin rural and outer island areas covering eastern and central divisions of the Fiji Islands. Most of the family members \nrely on subsistence economy, and main cash crops are copra and kava. A recent poverty assessment of hardship \nby ADB indicated that 35\u201340% of the population is likely to have incomes below the poverty line. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe latest official poverty analysis for Fiji Islands was undertaken by UNDP and published in 1997. The analysis \nwas based on the 1990/91 HIES. New HIES were undertaken by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics for the urban centers in \n2002/03 and the rural areas in 2003/04. The data from these two household surveys are  now being analyzed by the \nGovernment. During project preparation, a participatory poverty survey and social analysis will be undertaken to \ndetermine the extent of poverty and priorities of the people in the remote outer islands. \n \nC.   Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?                                        Yes \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                                        Yes \n \nThe TA calls for broad stakeholder consultations.              \n \nD.   Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nGender issues will be analyzed and integrated with the project design. Women have generally  played a major part \nin the subsistence economy but little in cash crop farming. They have  the potential to play an increased role in \ndiversified agriculture, including in such areas as horticulture, floriculture, small marine resources handicrafts, small-\nscale  processing,  and  micro-enterprises.  The  community-organizing  NGOs,  which  will  include  a  substantial \npercentage of women organizers, will seek to ensure effective participation by women in project activities. Skills \ntraining will involve women specifically targeting women\u2019s income-generating skills.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?                                        Yes \n \nE.
