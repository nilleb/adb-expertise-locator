INTRODUCTION \n1.  A South Asia Regional Department climate change implementation plan consultative \nmission was fielded in March 2009. During this time, the Government of Sri Lanka requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to assist the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources \n(MENR) to support climate change adaptation strengthening efforts. This request is in line with \nan important focus of the Sri Lanka country partnership strategy (CPS) 2009\u20132011,1 approved \nin  October  2008,  which  aims  to  (i)  strengthen  capacity  at  line  agencies  to  implement \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards,  and  (ii)  promote  climate  change  initiatives.  ADB \nresponded to this request by fielding a fact-finding mission in May 2009 to formulate capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA). Bilateral discussions were held with senior officials of \nMENR, the Centre for Poverty Analysis, Television for Education Asia Pacific and other climate \nchange  experts  both  from  within  the  Government  and  other  institutions.  Preliminary \nunderstandings and agreements were reached on the TA impact, outcome, implementation \narrangements,  cost  estimates,  and  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.2  The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   As a result of its densely populated and relatively low-lying coastline, Sri Lanka remains \nhighly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Sea level rise poses a threat to coastal \nassets,  livelihoods,  and  fragile  coastal  and  marine  habitats.  At  the  same  time,  raised \ntemperatures and unpredictable monsoon patterns are already showing signs of affecting the \ncountry\u2019s  agricultural  productivity.  These  key  risks  were  among  those  identified  by  the \nGovernment in its initial national communications on climate change, developed as part of its \ncommitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and \nhighlighted in the Government\u2019s Green Lanka program as priority areas requiring action. The \nGovernment  has  embarked  on  preparation  of  its  second  National  Communication  Study \n(2nd NATCOM), which it aims to complete by the middle of 2010. This is a large undertaking \nthat requires scientific assessments of predicted climate trends and their sectoral impacts. The \noverall responsibility of the 2nd NATCOM rests with the recently formed National Advisory \nCouncil on Climate Change within MENR, with representation from relevant line ministries and \nagencies. The NATCOM process is partially supported by Global Environmental Facility Funds. \n \n3.  As a direct result of the NATCOM process, there is emerging momentum in Sri Lanka on \nclimate-related  activities,  and  substantial  effort  in  government  departments  and  research \ninstitutions3 to understand and manage the impacts of climate change in a meaningful way\u2014\nparticularly on agriculture and water resources, which are key sectors for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic \ndevelopment.  Within  MENR,  a  Climate  Change  Secretariat  headed  by  a  director  has \nresponsibility over several separate units, covering both adaptation and mitigation aspects. This \nsecretariat, among other functions, is (i) the platform to address all climate change issues at the \nnational level, (ii) the dedicated institutional mechanism on climate change responses, and \n(iii) the repository of all climate change related data. It also facilitates climate change research \nand distribution of research results to trigger policy reforms and actions, and provides a one-\nstep  facility  to  develop  and  disseminate  project  information  relating  to  implementation  of \nUNFCCC and Conference of the Parties meetings. Where the secretariat is involved in activities \nthat concern other line ministries and agencies, steering committees are set up comprising \n                                                 \n1 Country Partnership Strategy. Sri Lanka 2009 \u2013 2011. ADB. 2008. Manila \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 June 2009. \n3 Columbia Earth Institute: http://iri.columbia.edu/staff/lareef; http://iri.columbia.edu/~mahaweli;    \n   http://iri.columbia.edu/~lareef/fect/reports/tenthbrochurehighres. \n ", "2   \ngovernment department representatives and individual experts. Among civil society, there is \nincreased awareness of the importance of addressing climate change adaptation responses, \nand  recognition  that  this  be  conducted  with  full  stakeholder  consultation  and  involvement. \nPractical  Action4  has  taken  a  lead  supporting  role  in  this  activity,  in  conjunction  with  the \nGovernment, and is currently engaged in a series of consultations in the Western, Eastern, and \nSouthern provinces of the island.  \n \n4.  Climate change is likely to threaten the significant achievements Sri Lanka has made in \nthe last 20 years in increasing incomes and reducing poverty. Climate change and variability \npose significant threats to the achievement of long-term development goals, especially those \nrelated to eliminating poverty and hunger, ensuring food and health security, human rights, and \npromoting  environmental  sustainability.  Climate  change  induced  vulnerability  and  natural \ndisasters have amplified the problems of environmental degradation, and have led to serious \ndeterioration  of  ecosystem  goods  and  services  \u2013  adding  yet  another  dimension  to  the \npersistence of poverty. It is now acknowledged that attempts to reduce poverty will only be \nsustainable over the longer term if they simultaneously address climate change issues in the \ndevelopment process.  \n \n5.  Sri Lanka recognizes that climate change impacts will affect vulnerable populations that \nwill be impacted by changes, including coastal communities and rural farming communities \nreliant  on  water  resources.  According  to  the  outcomes  of  the  national  capacity  self \nassessment,5 significant challenges lie in responding institutionally to the impacts of climate \nvariability  and  extreme  weather,  developing  risk  management  procedures  and  a  holistic \nadaptation  strategy,  and  strengthening  climate  change  risk  management  capacities  at  the \nnational and local levels\u2014where, for example, district environment and agriculture officers are \noften stretched in terms of the geographical areas they cover, and limited in their technical \ncapacity to provide advice to stakeholders with legitimate concerns relating to changing weather \npatterns and their effects on crop selection, suitability, productivity, etc. The assessment also \nindicated that improved public awareness of climate change risks and adaptation techniques is \na priority area for action, particularly in rural areas. \n \n6.  Opportunities for ADB support. At present, there is a large disparity in the level of \neducation, information, and awareness on climate change risks, issues, and responses at the \nregional, national, and local levels, and within vulnerable sectors. There are also serious human \nresource requirements in terms of adequately trained officials at the central and local level to \nmanage the growing manifestations and impacts of climate change. With this background, by \nattempting to address these gaps, the TA will support the CPS 2009\u20132011 to (i) strengthen \ncapacity at line agencies to implement environmental safeguards that take into account climate \nchange impacts through risk proofing, and training, etc., (ii) assist MENR mainstream climate \nchange initiatives in the development planning process (as outlined in the Government\u2019s Ten \nYear Development Framework); and (iii) promote climate change initiatives. Overall, the TA will \nprovide  ADB  with  a  unique  opportunity  to  assume  a  major  development  partner  role  in \nfacilitating and negotiating for adaptation programming in Sri Lanka. It will also enable MENR to \nplay a strategic role over the longer term in building capacity within other ministries and line \nagencies  to  manage  climate  change  adaptation  planning  effectively  within  their  respective \nsectors. \n \n                                                 \n4 Formerly known as the Intermediate Development Technology Group. \n5 Capacity Assessment and Action Plan for Developing Capacity for Compliance with Global Conventions on  \n  Biodiversity, Climate Change and Land Degradation.

The impact of the TA will be increased resilience within Sri Lanka to climate change \nimpacts  in  support  of  sustainable  economic  development  and  conservation  of  the  natural \nenvironment.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  improved  effectiveness  of  environmental \nmanagement and better organization of concerned stakeholders to address climate change\u2014\nresulting  in  an  enabling  strategy  for  climate  change  adaptation,  with  increased  public \nawareness, and strengthened institutional capacities of the agencies concerned.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  a  strategic  program  for  climate  change \nadaptation, including the development of a climate change adaptation strategy, (ii) a priority \naction plan and investment strategy for projects focused on climate change adaptation, (iii) an \ninstitutional  development  strategy  with  a  program  of  capacity  development  and  training \nrequirements, and (iv) an information and awareness program. This will involve working with a \nvariety  of  stakeholders,  including  relevant  ministries  and  line  agencies,  nongovernment \norganizations, academia, media and education representatives, and affected communities. In \nthis  way  and  through  MENR\u2019s  engagement  with  a  range  of  partners  the  strategy  that  is \ndeveloped will be responsive to other stakeholders\u2019 needs, and the reality on the ground. \nDevelopment of the action plan and investment strategy will involve close coordination and \ninteraction with the MOFP, as the prescribed work draws on its core area of competence.  \n \n9.  The main outputs and activities of the TA are described below:  \n \n(i)  Strategic  program  for  climate  change  adaptation.  ADB  interventions  will \nsupport Sri Lanka\u2019s pioneering efforts in developing a country-driven strategic \nprogram  for  climate  change  adaptation\u2014expediting  access  to  financing  for \npriority  adaptation  measures.  A  climate  change  adaptation  strategy  will  be \nformulated as part of this component. The TA will also support the involvement of \nkey stakeholders at national and local levels in developing a strategic program \nand  medium-term  investment  plan  that  will  prioritize  and  identify  activities \nrequired  to  address  climate  change  adaptation  risks  and  sustainable \nenvironmental management at the national and local levels. This process will be \ncoordinated  with  and  complemented  by  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Second  National \nCommunication preparation process, and will complement ongoing government \nefforts to develop a separate national adaptation policy framework. The TA will \nassist  relevant  line  agencies  to  plan  and  develop  a  portfolio  of  priority  and \npractical projects focused on climate change adaptation. To do this, a review of \nthe Government\u2019s Green Lanka Programme, among other relevant government \nplanning documents, will be undertaken\u2014together with coordinated consultations \nwith relevant government line agencies and departments spanning a variety of \nsectors (agriculture, fisheries, water, etc). Assistance through the TA will be \nprovided  for  project  concepts  to  be  formulated,  specifically  targeting  climate \nchange adaptation interventions. Finally, an investment plan for accessing grant \nfinancing  based  on  the  adaptation  strategy  will  be  developed  in  close \ncoordination with the MOFP. \n \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Partners Forum. The TA will also build on ADB\u2019s experience elsewhere in the \nAsia  Pacific,  which  has  demonstrated  the  benefit  of  developing  member \ncountries  developing  a  coordinated  strategic  program  for  climate  change \nadaptation  that  identifies  areas  where  international  financing  can  best  be \nprovided, and will aim to present such strategy to external partners at a Partners \nForum to negotiate financing options. The TA is intended to build on lessons \nlearned from the convening of a Partners Forum to support national efforts aimed \nat tapping various funding sources that are being created for climate change \nadaptation globally, and channel these for the benefit of Sri Lanka\u2019s Strategic \nProgram for Climate Change Adaptation and medium-term investment plan. The \nMOFP will play a significant role in this effort, especially in the development of \nthe medium-term investment plan and tapping into concessional funding sources. \nThe TA will strengthen the MOFP so that it will be in a better position to work with \nMENR to prepare and tap into funding sources. The TA will assist the MOFP in \nundertaking this role in line with obligations under the Bali Action Plan formulated \nby member countries of the UNFCCC at the 13th Conference of the Parties, and \nthe outcomes of the first Finance Ministers Meeting on Climate Change where it \nwas agreed that ministers of finance would take a more active role in integrating \nclimate change issues into development planning.  \n(iii)   Public information and awareness. An education, information, and awareness \nstrategy will be developed and implemented to increase understanding of climate \nchange  adaptation  risks  and  adaptation  responses  at  national,  local,  and \ncommunity levels; and promote support for public spending for climate change \nadaptation.  \n(iv)  Strengthening institutional framework. Sri Lanka\u2019s technical capacity must be \nstrengthened  to  handle  the  new  challenges  of  increasingly  destabilized \nenvironments  and  environment-dependent  economic  and  social  activities. \nCapacity at the national-level Climate Change Secretariat within MENR will be \nstrengthened for integrating and coordinating central and district government \ninstitutions in climate change risk management processes. Simultaneously, the \nTA will support the strengthening of capacity among district and central level \nenvironmental  staff  through  climate  change  vulnerability  assessments, \nvulnerability mapping, and adaptation planning. The Project will be undertaken \nthrough a participatory process involving central government, provincial councils, \nand affected communities\u2014resulting in hands-on training in climate change risk \nmanagement processes. The TA will also assist MENR in preparing government \nresponses  in  international  and  regional  climate  change  meetings  where  its \nstrategic approach to climate change adaptation may be showcased.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA (see Appendix 2) is estimated at $875,000 equivalent, $700,000 \nof which will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund.  The Government, \nthrough MENR, will finance the remaining $175,000 equivalent through provision of office space, \ntransport, counterpart staff, data and analysis, and other administrative costs.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  MENR, through its Climate Change Secretariat, will be the Executing Agency for the TA. \nIt will appoint a technical director and/or national coordinator at a senior level. MENR will also \n ", "        5\n \nform a project preparatory working group including (i) specialists in agriculture, fisheries, forestry, \ncoast conservation, and other relevant representative agencies nominated by the departments \nconcerned; and (ii) an interdepartmental TA steering committee, chaired by the secretary of \nMENR,  including  representatives  from  the  Department  of  External  Resources,  MOFP,  the \nNational Planning Department, and a group of renowned sector specialists to implement and \nguide the TA activities.  \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented in three phases over 9 months from 2009 to 2010, with \nphases I and II to be completed over the first 6 months. Phases I and II will develop the strategic \nadaptation framework, adaptation strategy, and implementation and investment plan; and will \ncomplete  the  draft  final  report  and  final  report,  including  study  reports,  environmental \nassessment reports, social impact assessment reports, and communications report. Over the \nsubsequent 3 months (phase III), the TA will provide support for pilot demonstration, additional \ntraining,  and  information  dissemination  related  activities.  All  equipment  for  the  TA  will  be \nprocessed according to ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n13.  A team of international consultants will be engaged for 17 person-months and a team of \nnational consultants for 28 person-months to help implement the TA. The consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). The TA will require international expertise in the following areas: \nteam leader/strategic planning expert (8 person-months), environment specialist (4 person-\nmonths), social and community development (mobilization) specialist (2 person months), and \ncommunications and education specialist (3 person-months). National consultants will include a  \ndeputy team leader (8 person-months), environment specialist (6 person-months), institutional \nand  community  development  specialist  (6  person-months),  and  communications/media \nspecialist (6 person-months). Since the terms of reference of the consultants require highly \nspecialized skills and production of independent studies and reports (sometimes in selected \ngeographical regions of the island), all the relevant experts will not be available in house in a \nsingle firm, which reduces the flexibility in selecting the best team. Moreover, firms\u2019 margins \nwould significantly increase the costs of hiring consultants who could be recruited individually. \nGiven ADB\u2019s relatively recent entry into the climate change arena in Sri Lanka, it is anticipated \nthat this TA will require more specialized management by the relevant ADB project officer which \nwill lead to a more enhanced quality output. Therefore, individual consultants will be engaged \nfor cost-effective and efficient implementation of the TA within the available budget. Outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  The TA progress will be measured, as stipulated in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1). The TA outputs will be disseminated in national and regional workshops, and as \npart of local level capacity building training workshops.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n \n15.
