INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested support to \nstrengthen the policy environment to improve the social integration of migrants through evidence-\nbased research.1 The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the National \nHealth and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) to assess the well-being and the social \nintegration of migrants through (i) analyzing the current situation of migrants and their families, (ii) \nexamining international best practice, (iii) developing an evaluation index to measure social and \nphysical integration, and (iv) providing evidence-based policy recommendations to improve the \nphysical and psychosocial integration of migrant populations in urban areas.  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy \nfor the PRC, 2016\u20132020, which focuses on supporting inclusive economic growth, and the Social \nProtection Operational Plan, 2014\u20132020, and is included in the country operations business plan \nfor the PRC, 2017\u20132019.2 The TA is also aligned with the PRC Thirteenth Five-Year Plan,     \n2016\u20132020 which reaffirms a sustained commitment toward access for migrants to social services \nand their fundamental rights in an effort to mitigate social exclusion and isolation.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Economic development in the PRC has led to rapid urbanization and industrialization, \nwhich has been accompanied by massive internal migration and social transformation. While the \nperiod from the late 1950s to the late 1970s brought strict migration control through the hukou \nsystem,4 gradual economic reforms and reduced migration controls in the early 1980s led to \nincreased mobility. The majority of internal migrants are aged 25\u201349 years and are moving from \nrural to urban areas in search of employment opportunities created by market reforms and labor \ndemand. The PRC urbanization rate increased from 19.4% in 1980 to 52.6% in 2012, with an \nestimated 200 million rural migrants working in the largest cities.5 However, even with the \nrelaxation of the hukou system, the PRC has not completely reduced migration restrictions. Urban \nhukou continues to be withheld from most rural migrants who, as a result, are not afforded the \nsame jobs and subsidized services as urban residents. Consequently, in urban areas, there has \ndeveloped a type of invisible hierarchy among laborers that has led to rural migrants often being \nunderpaid and marginalized in the lower ranks of urban society, both economically and socially.6 \nThis has led to two groups of migrants: (i) permanent migrants, who have officially changed their \nresidence through a hukou change; and (ii) temporary migrants, who are also referred to as the \n\u201cfloating population\u201d since their movement is not associated with a hukou change.7   \n                                                \n1  Migrants in this TA report refers to rural to urban internal migrants. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 November 2017.

Internal migration has brought a range of issues facing migrant populations and a new set \nof social and economic challenges. As rural residents move to cities in search of employment, \ntheir social status suffers. Resulting from this are social challenges that have led to social inequity, \nmarginalization, and disenfranchisement of migrant populations. Studies show that migrants often \nreport  lower  levels  of  average  subjective  well-being  than  urban  and  rural  residents.8 The \ninflexibility of the hukou has also led to differences in access to social services and discrimination \nbased on hukou residency. The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan calls for action to register hukou-less \ncitizens and to provide them with basic social services to improve their integration in all facets of \nsociety.  \n \n5.  The migration experience is deeply affected by gender. In the PRC, studies have shown \nthat there is an increasing gender wage gap in urban areas, largely attributable to a more \nchallenging environment for women to find and secure employment. Subjective overall well-being \nis also significantly affected by gender, as is access to decent work. Migrant women workers are \nalso more likely to have grievances such as unpaid wages, inadequate pay increases, more \nforced overtime, and factory layoffs.9 The gender differentials in the migrant experience are less \nunderstood and warrant more attention.  \n \n6.  The TA will help NHFPC develop a knowledge base to support the integration of migrant \npopulations by understanding their current gender needs and level of well-being through the \ndevelopment of an evaluation index that is gender-disaggregated.10 The TA will use evidence \nfrom the evaluation index and international best practice from other countries\u2019 experiences \nintegrating rural internal migrants into urban areas to inform policy recommendations that are \ngender-specific. This will support the development of a knowledge and research base on the \noverall well-being and needs of the growing migrant populations in the PRC.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: social status and integration of migrant \npopulations improved in accordance with the PRC Thirteenth Five-Year Plan. The TA will have \nthe following outcome: policy base for the social integration of migrants strengthened.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n8.  Given the increasing evidence of social, economic, and physical marginalization of rural \nmigrants, the TA will seek to improve the well-being and overall integration of migrants in urban \nareas. Key areas that require attention include (i) research on factors that affect the integration of \nmigrants in urban areas; (ii) development of an evaluation index to assess the degree of social \ninclusion and exclusion of migrants; and (iii) use of best practices from other countries that have \nsuccessfully achieved the social, economic, and physical integration of migrants and generate \npolicy recommendations to improve the social status of the migrant population. ADB support will \npresent applicable international experience on interventions and methods that could improve the \n                                                \n8  A. Akay, O. Bargain, and K.

ADB\u2019s knowledge and international experience will be used \nwhen designing the index to measure integration. The knowledge and support outputs to be \ndelivered by the TA are described below. \n \n9.  Output 1: International and national experience on social integration of migrant \npopulation reviewed and compiled. The TA will review international and national experience \non the social integration of migrant populations and generate at least four case studies on best \npractices  that  have  successfully  improved  or  provided  appropriate  social  and  physical \nenvironments for migrant populations, with a section on gender-specific needs. The report will \nalso identify background information on social equity considerations in the PRC that can help \nimprove the overall well-being of the migrant population.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Evaluation index on social and physical integration of migrants developed. \nThe TA will support the development of an evaluation index to measure the social and physical \nintegration  of  migrants  in  urban  areas.  The  index  will  focus  on  the  social,  physical,  and \npsychosocial integration of migrants to assess their overall well-being using existing data to \nestimate levels of integration. Qualitative and quantitative surveys on a sampling basis will assess \nthe availability of data and assist in understanding the difficulties faced by migrants. The index \nwill be piloted in select communities. A report documenting the index will be prepared under the \nTA. \n  \n11.  Output 3: Policy recommendations on integration of migrants developed. The TA \nwill support the development of policy recommendations to improve social inclusion and ways in \nwhich social services can be provided to migrants within existing policy frameworks. In addition, \nthe recommendations will consider gender needs and will be provided in the form of a policy brief. \n \n12.  Output 4: Knowledge development and dissemination supported. Three workshops \nwill  be  organized  with  participation  of  relevant  central  and  provincial  government  officials, \ninternational partners, and other research partners to discuss and disseminate TA findings and \npolicy recommendations. A knowledge product on the evaluation index for the integration of \nmigrants will also be prepared. The TA final report will be submitted to NHFPC and ADB.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, \nvenues for meetings, counterpart staff, miscellaneous administration support, and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The executing agency will be NHFPC and the implementing agency will be the Executive \nLeadership Training Center of NHFPC.
