During  the  final  tripartite  meeting  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  advisory \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)1 in  July  2005,  the  Government  of  Uzbekistan  requested  ADB \nassistance to develop small hydropower (SHP) plants along the existing irrigation canals and \nreservoirs. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update 2006 included the proposed Rural \nRenewable Energy Development Project. The concept paper for the project preparatory TA2 \nwas  approved  in  September  2005,  and  a  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Uzbekistan  from                        \n11 to 16 October 2005. Discussions were held with the Government on the TA\u2019s impacts, \npurpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference for consulting services. The TA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Agriculture is the foundation of the Uzbek economy and accounts for about 28% of gross \ndomestic product, 44% of employment, and 66% of export revenues. The climate and the \nconcentration of rainfall in the winter make irrigation an absolute necessity for crop production. \nIrrigation determines the size of the cropping area. The irrigated area is currently 4.2 million \nhectares, which supports more than 95% of all agricultural production. The agriculture sector \nuses about 90% of available water resources for irrigation purposes through an extensive \nnetwork that consists of reservoirs, canals, and irrigation pumps. The Ministry of Agriculture and \nWater Resources (MAWR) is responsible for the upkeep, operation, and maintenance of the \nirrigation network. The agriculture sector is also a major consumer of electricity, consuming \nabout 30% of total electricity production, about 50% of which is used for pumping.3  \n \n3.  Uzbekistan has substantial energy resources. The total reserves of hydrocarbon fuels \nare estimated at more than 7.7 billion tons of oil equivalent, 2 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, \n600 million barrels of oil, and approximately 4 billion tons of coal. Natural gas is the dominant \nenergy source, with current production of about 62 billion cubic meters per year, most of which \nis consumed domestically for power generation, heating, and production of petrochemicals. \nElectricity  production  is  based  primarily  on  conventional  thermal  power  generation,  which \naccounts for about 87% of total electricity production: 77% from plants powered by natural gas, \n7% powered by heavy fuel oil, and 3% powered by coal. The remaining 13% of electricity comes \nfrom hydropower plants. Electricity production has been decreasing since independence, mainly \nbecause  of  aging  of  plants,  inadequate  maintenance,  and  underinvestment.  According  to \npublished  statistical  data,  only  about  49  terawatt-hours  (TWh)  were  generated  in  2003, \ncompared with generation of more than 56 TWh in 1990. Since 1996, Uzbekistan has been a \nnet importer of electricity.  \n \n4.  Total installed capacity for electricity generation is 11.6 gigawatt (GW) and consists of    \n11 large thermal power plants (9.9 GW) and 31 hydropower plants (1.7 GW). The main power \nutility is Uzbekenergo, which owns all the thermal power plants and about 1.4 GW of the \nhydropower plants. MAWR owns the remaining 0.3 GW of the hydropower plants. Uzsuvenergo4 \nis mandated to operate and maintain MAWR owned hydropower plants. It currently operates      \n4 SHP plants and sells electricity to Uzbekenergo through a power purchase agreement at \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Off-Grid Renewable Energy Development. \nManila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 3 November 2005.  \n3  The sector also uses electricity for such activities as heating greenhouses and raising livestock and poultry.  \n4  Uzsuvenergo was formed in 1996 as a special association under MAWR.  \n ", "2   \ntariffs set by the Ministry of Finance. The tariffs are adjusted annually, and since 2000 have \nincreased by 850% to the current tariff of sum24.60 per kilowatt-hour. \n \n5.  Almost all the electricity generation plants are old, with an average age of more than            \n30 years, and require substantial rehabilitation. According to a recent estimate,5 investment of \nabout $1 billion will be required to rehabilitate just the thermal power plants in the next 5 years. \nThe  reliability  of  plants  and  equipment  is  poor.  Available  power  plant  capacity6 is  about                \n7,800 megawatts (MW), compared with peak demand of about 8,500 MW. The outcome is \nfrequent brownouts, especially in rural areas, which are at the far end of the distribution system. \nLimited maintenance of aging infrastructure and underinvestment mean that the transmission \nand distribution network is also weak, resulting in excessive losses that are estimated at about \n22%. \n \n6.  The Government has drawn up a plan7 for additional capacity that primarily involves \nrehabilitating existing thermal power plants and building new gas-fired power plants located \ncloser to the major load centers, which is unlikely to provide relief to rural consumers located at \nthe far end of the transmission and distribution network. Reliable electricity supply is a key rural \ninfrastructure need that is required to support and accelerate rural development. Lack of reliable \nelectricity inhibits industrial and commercial activities, thereby constraining economic growth \nand employment generation in rural areas; promotes switching to more polluting fuels, with \nconsequent environmental impacts; causes hardship to the population; and affects people\u2019s \nhealth.  \n \n7.  About 70% of the country\u2019s 24.8 million people live in rural areas, often with insufficient \naccess to quality basic services. In rural areas, the electricity supply is unstable (lower voltages, \nfrequent brownouts and blackouts). This primarily impedes the operation of irrigation systems, \nwhich increases the risk of crop failure. The poor availability of electricity and the absence of \nlocal  generating  capacity  increase  dependence  on  diesel-pumping  stations.  Currently                \n15,000  portable  diesel-pumping  stations  consume  about  15,000  tons  of  diesel  annually.           \nThe environmental costs of such operations are large because of the emission of air pollutants. \nThe lack of electricity in rural areas also results in lower levels of higher-value agricultural \nprocessing. Estimates indicate that about 30% of the fruit and vegetable crop is wasted because \nof a lack of storage or processing facilities.  \n \n8.  In many rural areas, decentralized generation through renewable energy sources, mainly \nthrough SHP plants, offers a competitive and environmentally-friendly option for addressing \nelectricity shortages. The hydropower potential from natural water flows is estimated to be about \n20,000 MW, about 30% of that from SHP plants. Only 30% of the SHP plant potential is \ncurrently being used. If the potential for SHP plants is optimized, the electricity generated will be \nsufficient to power all pumping stations under MAWR\u2019s jurisdiction. The Government recognizes \nthe importance of decentralized generation, and the development of SHP is a priority in the \ncountry\u2019s investment policy as embodied in the state program.8 The program highlights the \nimportance of harnessing the potential of SHP plants to improve the power supply in rural areas. \nStudies show the technical feasibility of constructing 43 SHP plants along existing reservoirs, \nand irrigation canals. The dual use of water for power generation and irrigation augurs well for \nsustainable development. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

In 2002, ADB approved an advisory TA grant (footnote 5) to assess the level of current \nenergy  consumption  by  different  sectors of  the  economy  and  future  demand,  the  balance \nbetween demand and supply, the potential for improving energy efficiency, and the options for \nmeeting  future  demand  in  an  efficient  and  reliable  manner.  The  advisory  TA  identified \nconsiderable opportunities for energy efficiency improvements.9 In the power sector, it identified \ndecentralized generation of renewable energy as a least-cost and more energy efficient option \nfor meeting rural electricity demand. It concluded that because of seasonal complementarity,10 \nthe development of SHP plants along the irrigation network could be the most suitable technical \noption for meeting peak electricity demand in the summer. It recommended further analytical \nwork to assess the feasibility of SHP plant development.  \n \n10.  In 2003, ADB approved another advisory TA grant (footnote 1) with a more focused \napproach  to  analyze  the  suitability  of  renewable  energy  development  in  the  country.                 \nThe  advisory  TA  included  an  in-depth  assessment  of  renewable  energy  resources  and                 \ncost-effective options for developing them. It concluded that SHP plants along the existing \nirrigation canals and reservoirs are the most cost-effective and technically developed option for \nrenewable energy that is available to most regions. It identified 20 possible sites for SHP plants \nin Andijan, Fergana, Samarkand, and Tashkent regions, taking into account the power supply \ndeficit, the potential for rural industrial applications, the agricultural output, and the number of \ninstalled  irrigation  pumps.  It  short-listed  seven  priority  SHP  subprojects;  undertook  a \nprefeasibility  evaluation;  and  found  that  all  seven  sites  were  technically  and  economically \nfeasible and had substantial economic, social, and environmental benefits. Based on detailed \ndiscussions with relevant Government agencies and ministries, the top five SHP subprojects \nwere recommended for ADB financing. A project preparatory TA was deemed necessary to \nreview, supplement, and upgrade the prefeasibility evaluation, in particular, to strengthen the \ntechnical,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  analyses.  The  project  preparatory  TA  will \nanalyze and prepare the proposed Rural Renewable Energy Project for possible ADB financing \nin 2006.  \n \n11.  The development of SHP plants is a Government investment priority (para. 8). MAWR, in \nconjunction  with  Uzsuvenergo,  is  mandated  to  develop  SHP  plants.  Recognizing  the \nunsustainability of the country\u2019s high energy intensity, in 2002 the Government launched the \nEnergy Saving Program to improve the efficiency of energy supply. The program aims to \ngenerate an additional 2 TWh of hydropower by 2010.  \n \n12.  The development of renewable, clean energy sources to provide direct benefits to rural \npoor is a priority of ADB\u2019s energy policy. Accelerating rural development by strengthening rural \ninfrastructure and services is a strategic focus of ADB\u2019s country program. The strategy aims to \nforge linkages across rural development themes to encompass agricultural productivity; access \nto rural infrastructure, including water supply and renewable energy; and rural finance. In the \nenergy  sector,  the  strategy  focuses  on  reforming  energy  utilities  by  means  of  increased \ntransparency in financial reporting and improved sector management. The proposed project will \nhave synergy with ongoing interventions in the agriculture sector, where farm privatization is \nexpected by 2007. Improved irrigation and a more reliable rural electricity supply will enhance \nfarmers\u2019 crop production and income-generating capacity, thereby contributing to the success of \nthe ongoing policy reforms. \n \n \n                                                 \n9  Uzbekistan\u2019s energy intensity (primary energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product) is about 1.5 to 2.0 \ntimes higher than that in other developing countries.  \n10 The maximum output of SHP plants along the irrigation network will be during the summer peak flow period.  \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The TA impact will be to promote economic development in the rural areas of, Andijan, \nFergana,  and  Samarkand  regions  by  providing  reliable  and  environmentally  clean  energy.            \nThe project preparatory TA outcome will be an agreement with MAWR and the Government on \nthe Project\u2019s design, a detailed feasibility report, and the implementation arrangements for the \nProject.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will (i) analyze growth and electricity demand by region and assess a least-cost \noption  for  addressing  the  imbalance  between  demand  and  supply  in  the  project  area;                      \n(ii) prepare a problem tree and the initial project design and monitoring framework; (iii) review \nthe technical prefeasibility study and optimize and upgrade the technical design and feasibility \nreports; (iv) carry out stakeholder workshops; (v) complete a baseline survey; (vi) carry out \nsocial, poverty, ethnic minority, and gender assessments; (vii) prepare draft bid documents in \nline  with  ADB  guidelines  and  recommend  measures  for  strengthening  the  management  of \nproject  implementation;  (viii)  carry  out  financial,  economic,  and  institutional  analyses;                     \n(ix) complete a summary initial environmental examination; (x) assess the potential for reducing \ncarbon emissions under the Clean Development Mechanism; (xi) finalize the project design and \nmonitoring  framework;  (xii)  assess  the  financial  management  capabilities  of  the  project \nimplementing agency; and (xiii) conduct workshops and seminars for disseminating the TA\u2019s \nresults.  \n \n15.  The major risks that need to be considered for successful implementation of the TA \ninclude (i) a change in MAWR\u2019s priorities, (ii) a lack of adequate and timely provision of data,           \n(iii) a delay in the submission of required studies, (iv) a delay in consultant selection, and                 \n(v) the possibility of poor consultant performance. Efforts will be made to ensure that competent \nconsultants are recruited expeditiously. MAWR has agreed to provide adequate counterpart \nsupport and data as needed and to undertake and update all required studies according to a \ntimetable  agreed  with  ADB.  Close  coordination  among  the  consultants,  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, and ADB will further mitigate these risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  will  be  $400,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance  $300,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Finland and will be \nadministered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining $100,000 equivalent through \nin-kind contributions, including office accommodation and facilities, counterpart staff, and data \nand other information needed for the TA. The cost estimate and financing plan is shown in \nAppendix 2. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  MAWR  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  provide  a  TA  leader  for  day-to-day \nmanagement  of  TA  implementation.  The  Department  of  Economy  and  External  Economic \nRelations  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  will  play  an  overall  coordinating  and  advisory  role.                  \nIn consultation with ADB, the Department of Economy and External Economic Relations will set \n ", "  5\nup a steering committee consisting of representatives of relevant Government ministries and \nagencies and other stakeholders.  \n \n18.  The TA will be carried out over 8 months by a team of international and domestic \nconsultants. The TA will commence in December 2005 and will be completed in July 2006. The \ntotal  input  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  9  and  24  person-months, \nrespectively. The consultants will procure office equipment11 in accordance with arrangements \nacceptable to ADB and will deliver it to MAWR at the conclusion of the TA. \n \n19.  The international and domestic consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. The prefeasibility \nstudies were prepared under advisory TA (footnote 1). MAWR has requested direct selection of \nthe same consultant, because this TA\u2019s activities are a logical extension of the advisory TA\u2019s \noutputs and the consultant successfully completed the previous assignment. In view of this, \nADB will recruit the consultant following the direct selection procedure. If some of the experts \nused for the previous advisory TA are not available, ADB will supplement the consultant team \nby  recruiting  individual  consultants.  The  following  international  experts  will  be  required:                      \n(i)  a  hydropower  expert,  (ii)  a  financial  analyst  and  financial  management  specialist,                   \n(iii) an economist, (iv) an environmental specialist, (v) a procurement specialist, and (vi) a social \nand/or poverty specialist. Domestic consultants will be required in the same areas of expertise \nto support the international consultants. In addition, the domestic consultant team will include a \nteam leader to coordinate the TA\u2019s activities. Outline terms of reference for consulting services \nare in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The consultant will submit an inception report within 1 month of TA commencement, a \nmidterm report after 3 months, and a draft final report after 5 months. The final report will be \nsubmitted within 8 months of TA commencement. To improve the participatory project design, \nstakeholder workshops will be held at each of the subproject sites during the initial stages of TA \nimplementation. Workshops will be held at each of the five SHP plant sites to seek local \ncommunities\u2019 and project beneficiaries\u2019 views on improving the project design. Participation will \nbe encouraged through workshops and seminars that will discuss and share the results of the \nTA. Roundtable conferences with key stakeholders will be organized following the submission of \neach of the milestone reports. The TA\u2019s recommendations and analysis will be disseminated \nthrough a national-level seminar with broad participation by all stakeholders.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to the Government \nof Uzbekistan, to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Finland, for preparing the \nRural Renewable Energy Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n11 The office equipment will include two pentium computers, one printer, one photocopier, one digital camera, and \none facsimile machine.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \n       \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nEconomic development  Increased agricultural  National and regional  \u2022  The Government confirms \nin the rural areas of  production in rural  statistics   that it will give priority and \nAndijan, Fergana, and  areasa     provide resources to \nSamarkand regions    Regional power data  promote renewable \nthrough the provision of  Increased use of    energy  \nreliable and  renewable energya      \nenvironmentally clean      \u2022  Project design \nenergy   Augmented power    implemented effectively \nsupply to rural   \ncommunitiesa    \n \nDeveloped institutional \nand financial \nmanagement action \nplan \n       \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nProject design,  Memorandum of  Consultant\u2019s final report,  \u2022  Effective stakeholder \nfeasibility study, and  understanding following  memorandum of  participation and \nimplementation  the final tripartite  understanding, back-to- ownership developed \narrangements agreed  meeting signed by the  office report of the final   \nGovernment and ADB  technical assistance  Risk \nreview mission  \u2022  Key stakeholders do not \nagree with the technical \nassessment  \n \n       \nOutput      Assumptions \n       \nTechnical assessments  Inception report:   Project reports  \u2022  No restriction on the \ncompleted and design  week 4;    availability of and access \nrequirements met  midterm report:   Technical Assistance  to timely information and \n  week 12;  reviews weeks 5, 14, and  to personnel \ndraft final report:  20  \u2022  No restriction on \nweek 20;   accessing geographic \nfinal report: week 30  sites \n \n   \nActivities with Milestones \nInputs: $400,000 \n \n1.1  Analyze  regional  growth  and  electricity  demand  and  assess  the  ADB: $300,000 \nleast-cost option for addressing the imbalance between demand and  \u2022 Consultants: $246,000 \nsupply in the project area (weeks 1\u20136).
