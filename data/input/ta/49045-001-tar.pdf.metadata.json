INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Midterm Review (MTR) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s Strategy 2020 \nemphasizes the importance of enhancing the provision of knowledge solutions to developing \nmember countries (DMCs), and stresses that the value provided by ADB operations includes \ndelivering up-to-date knowledge products and services (KPS) and cross-country experiences, in \naddition  to  finance.  Knowledge  and  knowledge  management  are  recognized  as  important \nelements of ADB\u2019s finance++ approach, integrating ADB financing with support for knowledge \nsolutions. 1  \n2.  This technical assistance (TA) project has been developed to strengthen ADB\u2019s delivery \nof KPS to DMCs. In particular, it will assist DMCs covered by ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia \nDepartment (CWRD) adopt better knowledge solutions and catalyze transformative innovation \nin these countries.2 It will also conduct a study aimed at strengthening the impact of ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment  operations  in  Central  and West Asian  countries,  by  increasing  promotion for \ninclusive growth through ADB projects.3 \n3.  The TA conceptualization has benefited from consultations with governments and other \nlocal stakeholders in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Discussions were held in particular with the ministries \nof economy, energy, finance, and transport, as well as local think tanks and research institutes. \nThe  TA  design  benefited  as  well  from  substantial  input  received  from  resident  missions, \ndivisions, and units through regular meetings with knowledge focal points and their supervisors. \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Central and West Asian countries (footnote 2) currently face several challenges related \nto  weakening  energy  prices,  devaluation  of  their  currencies,  increasing  inflation,  and  an \neconomic  slowdown  in  the  countries  that  are  their  major  trading  partners  and  sources  of \nremittances. Economic vulnerabilities are often related to poor economic diversification, low \nlabor productivity, low levels of domestic savings, and insufficient development of the private \nsector. Increasingly, problems with income distribution hamper the achievement of inclusive \ngrowth, while various unresolved issues\u2014including with gender equality, access to finance and \neducation, and a mismatch between labor demand and skills formation\u2014create obstacles to \ninclusive development. Most Central and West Asian economies are in the middle-income \ngroup, and are at risk of falling into the middle-income trap, preventing them from shifting to \nhigher-income levels. Expanding their ability to generate, manage, and share knowledge is \nessential to overcoming these challenges and mitigating the structural risks inherent in their \neconomies.  \n5.  Furthermore, the importance of introducing focused, well-structured knowledge solutions \nincreases for upper middle-income countries; in order to enhance people\u2019s quality of life and \nenable cutting-edge technological development, these countries need to considerably expand \ntheir capacity to innovate. Knowledge is also needed to promote economic development in \nlower-income  countries,  those that  suffer from  structural  vulnerabilities,  and those  in  post-\nconflict situations. These countries can use knowledge solutions to distill lessons from countries \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n2  ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department covers the following countries: Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 April 2015. \n ", "2   \nthat  have  experienced  similar  challenges,  and  can  enable  economic  growth  by  adopting \ninternational best practices. \n6.  As DMCs in Central and West Asia implement policies and develop institutions that \nfacilitate the structural transformation of their economies, the expansion of knowledge and \nlearning from successful experiences are increasingly important. To enhance the quality and \neffective dissemination of KPS, the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 (footnote 1) calls for \nknowledge  partnerships  and  dialogue  opportunities  with  local  think  tanks  and  research \ninstitutes. \n7.  A common theme that emerged from consultations with governments is the generalized \nperception that inequality has recently increased across the region. Despite the progress made \nby Central Asian economies in recent years, the ongoing economic difficulties resulting from the \ndecline  in  energy  prices  and  devaluation  of  regional  currencies  is  significantly  disrupting \neconomic activity, with resulting negative impacts on jobs, remittances, and people\u2019s general \nwell-being.4  Local  experts  suggested  that  the  most  vulnerable  groups\u2014including  women, \npersons with disabilities, those living in rural areas, the less literate, and migrant workers\u2014are \nmost heavily impacted. These emerging concerns will require a dedicated study focused on \nissues related to creating jobs to promote inclusive growth in the region, including analyses to \nbetter understand the demand and supply sides of the labor market, access to economic \nopportunities, the actual extent and distribution of poverty, and wealth and income disparities\u2014\nand ultimately to guide ADB operations. \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA impact will be aligned with the long-term economic development strategies of \nCentral and West Asian countries by promoting their ability to use KPS. The TA outcome will be \nenhanced KPS delivery to DMCs. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will generate the following outputs: (i) enhanced delivery of demand-based KPS; \n(ii) compilation of data on KPS in Central and West Asia in support of the ADB-wide k-Nexus \ndatabase;5 and (iii) completion of a study on jobs to promote inclusive growth in Central and \nWest Asia, aimed at enhancing ADB operations. In particular, DMC demand for KPS has been \ndiscussed with governments and local stakeholders during missions organized in 2015, and it \nhas been considered in the preparation of country knowledge plans (CKPs).  \n10.  The creation of a KPS database is intended to help effectively manage KPS demands \nfrom DMCs and will be consistent with ADB\u2019s k-Nexus initiative. It will include an inventory of \nKPS delivered from January 2006 through June 2017. KPS reports will also be published and \nguidelines for maintaining and uploading the database will be prepared. The region-wide study \nis expected to be divided into three parts: (i) an analytical framework for inclusive growth, \ntailored to capture the existing economic environment in Central and West Asia; (ii) issues and \npolicies  related  to  job  creation,  skill  formation,  and  labor  migration;  and  (iii)  promotion  of \neconomic inclusiveness through improved ADB project design and operations in Central and \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2015. Asian Development Outlook: Financing Asia\u2019s Future Growth. Manila.  \n5  The ADB-wide k-Nexus initiative is an output under the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020; it is an online database \nthat lists completed, ongoing and planned ADB KPS.   \n ", "3 \nWest Asia. In addition to a final report delivered as a flagship publication, the study will generate \nseveral other knowledge products (e.g., technical notes, policy briefs, blogs, opinion essays, \nand other documents to help inform country partnership strategies and CKPs). Considerable \neffort will be made to disseminate the study through the region and beyond. \n11.  The TA assumes the presence of the following risks: (i) absorptive capacity of DMCs \nremains weak, (ii) DMC bureaucratic processes hinder effective use of knowledge, (iii) internal \ngovernment processes may delay the identification of the demand for specific KPS, (iv) a lack of \ncomplete and accurate information on KPS delivered in previous years, and (v) a lack of interest \nby DMCs to accept and endorse the study and its recommendations. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency, with CWRD\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Operations \nCoordination Division (CWRC) as the focal point. Activities organized under the TA will include \norganization of and participation in knowledge events such as workshops, conferences, and \nseminars.6 The TA will be implemented over a period of 29 months, from August 2015 to \nDecember 2017. The TA will require approximately 145 person-months of inputs from the \nfollowing consulting services: \n(i)  To assist with KPS delivery to DMCs, international and national consultants, as \nwell as think tanks/research institutes from Central and West Asia DMCs will be \nengaged on specific assignments, in close coordination with resident missions. \nThe pool of consultants will include international consultants (total of about 15 \nperson-months of services) and national consultants (total of about 52 person-\nmonths of services), including for editorial and translation work. \n(ii)  To assist with knowledge management coordination, national consultants will be \nengaged in ADB headquarters for about 29 person-months; assignments will \ninclude support in preparing guidelines for the KPS database, its maintenance, \nand  update;  conducting  the  KPS  stocktaking  exercise;  and  facilitating  the \npublication of KPS reports.  \n(iii)  To assist with drafting and finalizing specialized topics related to the study, the \nTA will engage several international consultants, including an economics editor. \nLocal think tanks/research institutes and peer reviewers will be engaged to help \nwith  preparing  background  papers,  conducting  surveys  and  interviews  as \nneeded, gathering and analyzing data, and performing quality control. The TA will \nengage  national  consultants  to  assist  with  data  gathering  and  analysis, \ncoordination, communication, and organization of knowledge events.7 \n                                                \n6  ADB staff involved with the TA may participate as resource persons in knowledge-sharing events, which will collect \nfeedback and suggestions on improving the activities being implemented under the TA.   \n7  In addition to engaging consultants and local think tanks/research centers, contributions to the study will be largely \nThmea vdiee wbys  AeDxpBr esstasfef dm ehmerbeeinrs  asreer vtihnogs aes o af utthheo rcso (nosf uclhtaanptte arsn,d p dapoe nrso, t pnoeliccey sbsraierfisly,  treecphrneicsaeln nt othteoss, ea nodf  AboDxBe\u2019ss) , \nmpeemebr erersv,ie Bwoearsr,d o or fa Ddviriesecrtso,r sb,a Mseadn oang einmdievindtu, aol re sxtpaefrf,ti saen,d in mteareys bt, ea npdre tliimmein aavrayi lainb inlitayt.u Treh.e   CWRD team leader \nfor the TA implementation will be the study\u2019s task manager, and will oversee the entire study structure and \ncontents, contributing as author to each of its parts and coordinating individual contributions from other staff and \nconsultants. The study will be conducted jointly by CWRD and the Economics Research and Regional Cooperation \nDepartment under the \u2018One-ADB\u2019 approach. \n ", "4   \n14.  To provide the above services under (i) the TA will engage individual consultants and \nthink  tanks/research  institutes  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  based  on  DMC  KPS  needs. \nRequirements will be formulated through specific KPS templates, including details about the \nterms of references for consulting services. Requests will be evaluated on the basis of their \nexpected contribution to filling knowledge gaps identified in DMC CKPs. Rankings will be made \nby CWRC based on funding availability and the comparative urgency of proposals. Eligible KPS \ninclude those relating to new projects and those meant to increase the knowledge component of \nongoing projects, or bridge with pipeline projects. \n15.  Consulting services (para. 13) will be sourced from individual consultants and/or think \ntanks/research institutes. Individual consultants will be engaged pursuant to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). In some cases, consulting \nservices may be rendered through output-based contracts and lump-sum payments. Due to the \nspecific nature of the services involved and the low contractual amounts, about 8\u201310 think \ntanks/research institutes will be engaged as consulting firms through single-source selection \nusing  biodata  technical  proposals,  in  close  consultation  with  DMC  governments  and  ADB \nresident missions. Think tanks/research institutes will be identified from August 2015 to March \n2016  and  listed  in  a  separate  memorandum  to  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Services  and  Financial \nManagement Department upon completion of consultation missions.  \n16.  Resource  persons  will  also  be  engaged,  based  on  their  academic  and/or  policy \nbackgrounds and qualifications, to serve as peer reviewers for knowledge products, and present \npapers and/or act as facilitators, speakers, and panelists in knowledge-sharing events such as \nconferences, workshops, seminars, and capacity building programs. \n17.  Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  cost  estimates  for \nengaging consultants and their indicative positions are in the cost estimates and financing plan \n(Appendix 2) and outline terms of reference for consultants (Appendix 3). All procurement will \nbe carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time \nto time). Upon completion of the TA, all procured equipment will be transferred to ADB. \n18.  CWRC will monitor TA progress and suggest actions to ensure the effective delivery of \nTA outputs. The TA will be monitored through KPS reports, and biannual progress reports \nprepared  by  the  knowledge  management  coordinator  that  detail  the  TA  work  program, \nmethodology, and timelines for finalizing the KPS stocktaking exercise and database creation, \nas well as the planning and delivery of KPS based on DMC requests. In addition, the region-\nwide study coordinator will prepare inception, interim and final reports detailing the study outline, \nmethodology, work program, milestone events, and outputs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Strengthening Knowledge Management in Central and West Asia, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5    \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the project is aligned with \n \nThe long-term economic development strategies of Central and West Asian countries by promoting their ability \nto use knowledge products and servicesa \n \n   \n   \nResults Chain  Performance Indicators with \nData and Reporting  Risks \nTargets and Baselines \nOutcome       \nEnhanced KPS  DMC endorsement of 10 CKPs  Knowledge-needs sections  Absorptive capacity \ndelivery to DMCs  and LINKs included in CPSs,  of CKPs included in CPSs  of DMCs remains \nCOBPs, and other documents  (ADB, various frequency of  weak \nthat reflect strategy statements,  publication) and LINKs   \nby 2017 (August 2015 baseline:  included in COBPs (ADB,  Bureaucratic \n0)  yearly)  processes in DMCs \nhinder effective use \nof knowledge \n \nOutputs       \n1.
