INTRODUCTION\n1.  The Government of Indonesia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to\nprovide advisory technical assistance (TA) to develop a regulatory framework and establish\nregulatory bodies in the water supply and wastewater sector. ADB fielded a TA fact-finding\nmission to Jakarta, Medan, Yogjakarta, and Mataram in August 2001 to formulate the TA.1 The\nmission  included  discussions  with  representatives  of  the  central  Government,  local\ngovernments,  associations  of  local  governments  and  water  enterprises,  external  support\nagencies, and consultants working in the water supply sector. The objectives, scope, cost\nestimates and financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA\nwere agreed with the Government, and a memorandum of understanding was signed during the\nMission. The TA framework is attached as Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  Improving the provision of infrastructure and services is a priority development objective\nof the Government as expressed in the National Development Program (PROPENAS). The\nprovision of water supply has been an important Government policy objective for decades. In\n1984,  previously  Government-owned  water  supply  agencies,  which  were  administered  and\nmanaged through the Government\u2019s provincial water supply departments were corporatized and\nlocal water enterprises, perusahaan daerah air minum (PDAMs), were established. Until the end\nof  2000,  local  infrastructure  investments,  including  upgrading  and  rehabilitating  existing\nfacilities,  were  financed  by  a  mixture  of  central  Government  grants,  local  revenues,  and\nsubsidiary lending. However, due to the lack of support from local councils to increase tariffs,\nthe economic crisis, and weak internal management maintenance, rehabilitation and expansion\nof the PDAM assets has become increasingly difficult. At present, most of Indonesia\u2019s PDAMs\nare technically bankrupt with operations continuing at a bare minimum of maintenance.2 The\nsituation is aggravated by the introduction of Law 22/1999 on Regional Governance and Law\n25/1999 on Fiscal Balance Between the Central Government and the Region, which devolved\nthe responsibility for local infrastructure provision to local governments, while at the same time\nreducing the level of direct central Government funding.\n3.  The Government is supporting regional autonomy and providing guidance by developing\nsector policies. To support the development of the water supply sector, ADB has, through policy\ndialogue and in line with ADB\u2019s Water Policy,3 assisted the Government to prepare the draft\nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Policy  Framework  for  Urban  and  Rural  Areas.  This  policy\nframework emphasizes the need for (i) water enterprise reform to improve their efficiency and\nfinancial  and  operational  performance,  (ii)  private  sector  participation  (PSP)  to  increase\ninfrastructure  investments,  and  (iii)  efficient  sector  regulation  to  balance  the  interests  of\noperators and consumers. ADB\u2019s Water Policy, Private Sector Development Strategy,4 and\ncountry strategy and program update5 support the Government\u2019s priorities in the water supply\nsector and the following mutually complementary activities are programmed in 2001 and 2002:\n(i)  Reform  of  Water  Enterprises  TA  to  establish  sound  operational,  management,  and\ncommercial  business  practices  and  procedures;  (ii)  PSP  Development  Facility  for  Urban\n                  \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 June 2001.\n2 The TA will be complemented by ADB\u2019s proposed TA: Reform of Water Enterprises.\n3 ADB. 2000.

Regulation  for  water  supply  was  introduced  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  for  a  number  of\nconcessions. The Canadian International Development Agency supported the preparation of the\nWhite Paper on Regulatory Strategy and Legal Framework to Support Infrastructure Reform.\nThis  paper  is  an  umbrella  strategy  and  does  not  specifically  cover  the  water  supply  and\nwastewater sector. Further TA is needed to facilitate an organized approach to water supply and\nwastewater  regulation  and  to  establish  a  regulator(s).  The  TA  will  complement  the\nGovernment\u2019s, ADB\u2019s, and other externally financed ongoing or expected activities to improve\nthe water supply and wastewater sector and to enhance PSP.\n5. To  date,  central  and,  following  regional  autonomy,  local  governments  have  been\nresponsible for water and wastewater infrastructure and have acted as owner, operator, and\nregulator. The inherent conflict of interest requires a separation of these roles. The provision of\npiped urban water supply contains significant monopoly elements. Monopoly supply does not\nrepresent an effective mechanism to provide efficient services at competitive prices. Where\nlocal governments act as monopoly suppliers, political agendas can provide disincentives for\ncost recovery and efficiency improvements. High political and regulatory risks translate into high\ntransaction  costs.  To  mitigate  these  risks  and  to  counteract  monopoly  power,  regulatory\nmechanisms and regulators need to be in place. Taking into consideration investments in the\nsector, they would rule on policy issues of service coverage, price, service quality, performance\nstandards, operator incentives, as well as penalties in case of violation of standards. The\nregulation  of  price  and  quality  of  service  is  relevant  for  public  and  private  water  supply\ncompanies alike, when competition is not feasible, to balance the interests of suppliers and\nconsumers.\n6.       The role of the central and local government is to formulate and articulate policies that are\nbinding on the sector regulator and to act on regulatory decisions. Considerable government\ncommitment is required to raise tariffs to cover costs, and to build regulatory arrangements that\ngive public and private water supply companies confidence that they will be able to receive an\nadequate rate of return on their investments. At the same time, price reviews are needed to\nensure that profits are not excessively high. Unexpected changes in the operating or financial\nenvironment will make it necessary for the regulator to adjust prices and performance standards\nfrom time to time. Good mechanisms protect consumers from high prices and low quality\nservice,  but  they  also  safeguard  the  legitimate  interests  of  water  enterprises  to  earn  a\nreasonable profit from their investments.\n7.       An effective regulatory framework would facilitate affordable delivery of adequate and\nsafe water to consumers, especially the poor. Pricing rules try to balance incentives to use\nwater efficiently with social concerns, such as quality of water supply, universal service goals,\nand subsidy schemes for the poor. Since the regulator has a counter monopoly to the water\nenterprises, power needs to be carefully defined to guard against the regulator abusing the\npower assigned and favoring governments or exploiting the customers or investors. The office\nof the regulator must be set up to be able to resist improper influence by any of the different\ninterest groups. A big challenge of good regulation is the generation of information that allows\nthe  regulators  to  establish  good  rules  and  allows  the  interest  groups  to  watch  out  for\nimproprieties by the regulator. The best way to generate information is to introduce multiple\nplayers in the water supply sector in ways that enhance direct or indirect competition, for\nexample, through benchmarking.", "3\n8. The need to raise tariffs to reasonable economic levels is urgent, but the issue is\nsensitive with claims that much of the population is living below the poverty line. Piped water\nsupply, however, is provided to 10\u201350 percent of the more affluent consumers, and many of\ntheir  tariffs  cover  only  about  20  percent  of  the  sustainable  cost  of  water.  The  poor  pay\nsubstantially  higher  prices  to  vendors.  The  Government  acknowledges  the  need  for  cost\nrecovery tariffs in water supply and wastewater; and will provide support by raising awareness,\nand within the context of regional autonomy, by facilitating the implementation of higher tariffs to\nachieve the cost recovery objectives.\n9. At present, virtually no municipalities manage wastewater, either publicly or privately.\nSome  of  the  few  examples  include  Bandung  and  Cirebon,  which  already  publicly  operate\nsewerage  systems.  Local  water  enterprises  are  anticipated  to  gradually  assume  greater\nresponsibility for the wastewater subsector; this needs to be considered when developing the\nregulatory framework.\n10. The TA and ADB\u2019s complementary activities will assist the Government in promoting\nPSP to address budgetary constraints and the resulting backlog of investments, provide access\nto private capital, free up budget resources for those social and environmental projects where\ncost recovery cannot be achieved, and increase the efficiency of local service delivery. The\nwater supply and wastewater sector in Indonesia was opened to PSP in 1994/95, but progress\nhas been hampered by the financial crisis, political instability, and the lack of clear Government\nsupport.  In  January  1998,  a  new  regulation,  Keppres  7/1998, was  introduced  to  promote,\nfacilitate,  and  regulate  PSP  in  the  provision  of  infrastructure.  This  regulation  introduced\ntransparent and competitive tendering as a requirement for PSP projects. However, Keppres\n7/1998 does not account for the regional autonomy, and the central Government\u2019s handling of\nPSP guidance needs to be optimized. The Government is aware of this problem, which will be\naddressed by ADB\u2019s TA on procurement policies, legal frameworks, and institutions.6 To regain\ninvestor  confidence  the  Government  has  set  up  the  interdepartmental  Committee  for\nAcceleration of Infrastructure Development, which is preparing an infrastructure law that will\nreview, upgrade, and combine the provisions of Keppres 7/1998 and Keppres 18/2000 (for\npublic  sector  procurement).  For  the  interim  period,  within  six  months  the  Government  will\nintroduce revisions for Keppres 7/1998 to remedy the current shortcomings.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n11. The  TA  will  help  develop  and  implement  a  regulatory  framework;  and  establish  a\nregulatory  body(ies)  to  facilitate  credible,  independent,  autonomous,  accountable,  and\ntransparent  regulation  for  water  supply  and  wastewater  enterprises  in  Indonesia.  The\nregulator(s) will protect the interests of all stakeholders, including the poor and will aim at\nproviding incentives for efficiency, and service coverage and quality at affordable prices. The\ngoal of the TA is to promote good governance in the water supply and wastewater sector and to\ncreate enabling conditions that are conducive to PSP.\n                  \n6 TA 3720-INO: Strengthening Procurement Policies, Legal Framework, and Institutions, for $500,000, approved on\n19 September 2001.", "4\nB. Scope\n12.  The TA will comprise three major components. Under the first component, the consultant\nwill review and analyze existing and draft laws, regulations, decrees, and policies related to the\nwater supply and wastewater sector and PSP, as well as the present responsibilities for and\neffectiveness of regulation. The analysis will give the consultant a practical understanding of the\ncurrent situation, and will provide the basis for identifying shortcomings for sector development\nand effective water supply sector regulation. Following the analysis, the consultant will review\ninternational good practice in water sector regulation; and will work with stakeholders to develop\na water supply sector policy statement for economic regulation, which will define the critical\nelements of an effective regulatory framework. Finally, the consultant will assess the adequacy\nand compatibility of existing regulation with the policy statement. Under the second component,\nthe consultant will prepare institutional options for regulation, and will facilitate stakeholder\nconsultation through workshops to consider current knowledge on regulatory arrangements\nworldwide and to identify a preferred institutional option. Based on the stakeholder consultation,\nthe consultant will develop a coherent regulatory framework for the preferred option. In this\ncontext,  the  consultant  will  also  assess  capacity  building  needs  for  implementation  of  the\nregulatory  framework.  The  third  component  will  provide  assistance  for  implementing  the\nregulatory framework and establishing the regulatory body(ies), including guidelines for the\nestablishment and operation of the regulator(s), as well as their duties, responsibilities, powers,\nand authorities. Assistance will be provided for the development of a web site for public access\nand information on water supply and wastewater enterprises/operators.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $988,000 equivalent, of which $708,000 is\nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $280,000  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide\n$790,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $82,000 equivalent of the\nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis\nSupport  Facility,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  finance  the\nremaining local currency costs equivalent to $198,000 through the provision of counterpart staff\nremuneration and per diem, counterpart staff travel, part of six stakeholder consultation and\ndissemination workshops, and office space. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are\nattached as Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n14. The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Agency for Construction and Investment\nDevelopment, represented by the Center for Infrastructure Investment Development (CIID),\ntogether with the Directorate General for Urban and Regional Development (DGURD), both\nunder the Ministry of Settlement and Regional Infrastructure. CIID together with DGURD will\nestablish a project management unit (PMU) that will be responsible for organizing the technical\nand administrative aspects of the TA. The PMU will include clearly identified, suitably qualified,\nand experienced counterpart staff, if necessary, supported by personnel from relevant line\nministries, to work alongside the TA consultants, including staff covering competencies and/or\nrelevant to regulation in the water supply sector, law, financial and economic analysis, and PSP\nin water supply projects. Counterpart staff will work full time and part time in an agreed mix\nunder the overall direction of the head of the PMU. The PMU will include at least one senior\nstaff member from CIID and DGURD. The TA consultants will provide full support to the head of\nthe PMU and will work in close collaboration with the counterpart team. The Government\u2019s", "5\ninterdepartmental Committee for Acceleration of Infrastructure Development will act as the TA\nsteering committee and support TA implementation.\n15. The TA will be carried out by a firm of consultants. The TA will require approximately 19\nperson-months of international and 20 person-months of domestic consulting services, with\nexpertise and hands-on experience in economic regulation in the water supply sector, financial\nand  economic  analysis,  water  tariff  structures  and  tariff-setting  mechanisms,  water  utility\nmanagement  and  private  sector  participation,  water  engineering,  and  law.  Because  of  the\nurgent need for this TA the Government has requested advanced action for the procurement of\nconsultants. Using the simplified technical proposal format, the consultants will be engaged in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  or  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Procurement of equipment will\nbe  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  To  facilitate  TA\nimplementation, CIID and DGURD will provide logistical support for the consultants, including\nadequately furnished office space within the agencies, and access to communications facilities.\nThe detailed logistical arrangements and PMU staff will be confirmed by the Government before\ncontract negotiation. The agencies will also provide the relevant laws, regulations, policies,\nexisting reports, and information. The consultants will be based in Jakarta and be expected to\ntravel as necessary to the regions, particularly during stakeholder consultations. Outline terms\nof reference for the consultants are included in Appendix 3.\n16.  The TA is expected to commence in January 2002, be implemented over 56 weeks, and\nbe completed in March 2003. The consultants will produce (i) an inception report within 4 weeks\nof  TA  commencement;  (ii)  an  interim  report  12  weeks  after  commencement;  (iii)  a  draft\nregulatory framework report 20 weeks after commencement; (iv) a final regulatory framework\nreport 24 weeks after commencement; (v) monthly progress reports on the establishment of the\nregulatory  body(ies)  and  training  of  regulatory  staff  thereafter;  and  (vi)  an  assignment\ncompletion report, outlining progress on the establishment of the regulatory body(ies) and any\nsteps to be taken, at the end of the assignment.\nIV.
