I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the ADB Clean Technology \nFund (CTF),1 both to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Sustainable Urban Transport for \nHo Chi Minh City Mass Rapid Transit Line 2 Project.2 \n \n2.  The project3 will support the effective and sustainable use of the new Line 2 of the Ho \nChi Minh City (HCMC) mass rapid transit (MRT) network4 now being developed with Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance.5  It will enhance the connectivity between the MRT Line 2 \nstations  and  other  modes  of  public  and  private  transport,  and  strengthen  urban  transport \npolicies  and  regulations.  By  contributing  to  an  efficient,  integrated,  and  sustainable  MRT \nsystem, the project will support the objective of the HCMC\u2019s Urban Transport Master Plan \n(HUTMP) to increase the use of public transport and reduce dependency on private vehicles. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  planned  and  is  making  major  public  transport \ninfrastructure investments to induce a substantial switch by urban citizens from private to public \nmodes of transport.6 A failure to invest in public transport infrastructure and to encourage this \nshift away from the use of private vehicles in Viet Nam\u2019s large cities will hurt economic growth \nand accelerate the degradation of the urban environment. The government is supporting climate \nchange mitigation efforts by adopting a low-carbon transport growth path that will be more \nenergy efficient and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ADB\u2019s 2012\u20132015 country partnership \nstrategy  for  Viet  Nam  supports  the  government's  program  to  improve  urban  transport \ninfrastructure and promote the use of public transport systems.7 \n \n4.  HCMC is the largest city in Viet Nam, with a greater urban area population of more than \n9.0 million that is expected to grow to 13.8 million by 2025. Urban transportation is dominated \nby private vehicles, mostly motorcycles, which account for 85% of all vehicles. The dominance \nof private vehicle use, combined with an inadequate road system, creates severe congestion \nand peak hour travel speeds on many routes that average less than 10 kilometers per hour. \nRoad safety is poor and the traffic accident rate high. The city\u2019s urban transport problem is \nworsening as incomes rise and many Vietnamese become able to shift from motorcycles to \ncars. The overall number of vehicles in HCMC is growing by more than 10% a year.  \n \n5.  The rapid growth of private vehicle traffic is partly due to HCMC\u2019s inadequate public \ntransport system. It currently consists of a poorly integrated, inefficient bus network that cannot \ncompete  with  transportation  by  motorcycles  and  cars.  Poor  institutional  arrangements  for \n                                                \n1  Financed by the Clean Technology Fund.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2011.

", "2 \nestablishing, allocating, and operating bus routes and providing reliable service limits ridership, \nwhich is part of the reason the system does not recover its operating costs. In addition, bus \nfares are kept low through heavy government subsidies. Planning, management, and control of \ntraffic in the city are weak, and few policies or regulations exist that seek to reduce reliance on \nprivate vehicles or encourage the use of public transit. Even the pedestrian walkways in HCMC \nare often congested, frequently because they are obstructed by unregulated motorcycle parking \nand other unauthorized private use. \n \n6.  HCMC is addressing these problems through the HUTMP, which also seeks to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions and other pollution, improve the urban environment, and cut down \nthe number of traffic accidents. The HUTMP proposes the development of a city wide mass \ntransit system.  Three MRT lines and a rapid transit bus line are currently under development.8 \nPhase 1 of MRT Line 2 is being financed by ADB and is expected to be operational in 2020.9 If \nthe MRT network is to be fully beneficial to users, however, complementary development is \nneeded to integrate it with other modes of public transit and private vehicle transport and ensure \nthat it is attractive, accessible, and affordable for the city\u2019s residents. The project will help \nintegrate the MRT Line 2 into the HCMC\u2019s overall public transport network by constructing \ninfrastructure and facilities at all stations that will improve designed access to the MRT and \nstrengthen  the  MRT\u2019s  connectivity  with  other  modes  of  transport  used  by  the  public  to \nstrengthen connectivity. The project will also support policy and regulatory reforms in the pricing \nfor  urban  transport  and  in  the  management  of  traffic  and  parking  that  will  define  clear \ninstitutional responsibilities for effective enforcement. \n \n7.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  close  coordination  with  the  activities  of  other \ndevelopment partners that are supporting urban transport improvements in HCMC (footnote 8). \nJoint development partner meetings with relevant HCMC public transport agencies will ensure \nthat policy and regulatory measures are consistent with other key initiatives currently underway, \nsuch as the development of integrated fare and ticketing systems, operations and maintenance \nsystems, and a public transport authority. \n \n8.  Previous urban transport infrastructure projects in Viet Nam have shown that strong \ngovernment support is needed to avoid implementation delays, ensure that quality works are \ndelivered, and make institutions sustainable.10 Advanced action to strengthen the capacity of \ndistrict  resettlement  offices  is  essential  for  timely  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement and to avoid start-up delays. These lessons have been incorporated in the design \nof this project. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  impact  of the  project  will  be  an  enhanced  public  transport system  serving  six \ndistricts of HCMC.11 The outcome will be the improved integration of MRT Line 2 stations with \n                                                \n8  These are the MRT Line 1 from Suoi Tien to Ben Thanh, cofinanced by the Government of Japan, under \nconstruction; the MRT Line 2 from Ben Thanh to Tam Luong, cofinanced by ADB, the European Investment Bank, \nand KfW, under procurement; and the MRT Line 5 from Bay Hien to Sai Gon Bridge, expected to be cofinanced by \nthe ADB, the European Investment Bank and Government of Spain, under design.  \n9  ADB. 2010.

The project will have three outputs: (i) improved accessibility at MRT Line 2 stations, (ii) \nthe development of public transport information systems, and (iii) the formulation of public \ntransport policy and systems developed. \n \n11.  MRT Line 2 station accessibility improved. These improvements, including public \ntransport facilities, will be constructed along the first stage of MRT Line 2 from Ben Thanh to \nTham  Luong  stations,  primarily  within  100  meters  of  nine  underground  and  one  elevated \nstations  along  the  10.3  kilometer  line.  Civil  works  will  include  pedestrian  subways  and \nfootbridges, bus stops and feeder links, dedicated taxi stands, park-and-ride facilities for two-\nwheeled  vehicles,  and  waiting  areas  for  other  public  transport  service  providers.  All \ninfrastructure and other facilities will have gender-sensitive and universal accessibility features \nand  safe  passageways  for  pedestrians.  The  project  will  also  establish  a  station  access \nmanagement system to facilitate the efficient flow of people and traffic around MRT Line 2 \nstations.  Traffic  police  enforcement  measures  will  be  improved  to  ensure  clear  pedestrian \naccess and smooth traffic flow and to manage parking of private vehicles around the MRT \nstations. The project will finance consulting services for detailed design and supervision of \nconstruction of the civil works and goods and services contracts, as well as for overall project \nmanagement. \n \n12.  Public  transport  information  system  established.  The  project  will  develop  an \ninformation system along MRT Line 2. It will be linked to the main bus control center in HCMC to \nprovide real-time bus and train arrival information that will make the public transport system \nmore convenient and reliable. The system will complement city-wide bus network improvements \nto be undertaken with the support of the World Bank.12 The project will be responsible for \ninstalling the equipment for the information system at the MRT Line 2 stations. The equipment \nrequired on buses and bus stops for the system will be financed and installed by the Ho Chi \nMinh City people\u2019s committee (HCMC PC), which administers the city, and bus operators. \n \n13.  Public transport policy and systems developed. To support the HUTMP\u2019s objectives \nand  make  public  transport  more  financially  sustainable,  the  project  will  provide  consulting \nservices to develop (i) a station access management system and enforcement measures to \nensure clear pedestrian access and proper use of public space by venders around the stations; \n(ii) a station parking policy to provide for the efficient flow of vehicles to and from the MRT Line \n2 stations; and (iii) a policy framework on the pricing of public and private transport in HCMC to \npromote a modal shift from private vehicles to the public transport system. The project will \ninclude capacity development and training to enable the HCMC transport agencies to implement \nand enforce the new policies and regulations. It will also provide equipment and consulting \nservices to establish comprehensive multimodal transport and traffic management modeling \nsystems that will be used to develop detailed pilot schemes to improve the integration of the \npublic system under the project.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $65 million, comprising $52.6 million in base costs \n(including local taxes and duties), $11.3 million for contingencies, and $1.1 million for financing \n                                                \n12 The World Bank\u2019s proposed Green Transport Project is expected to be approved in 2014. \n ", "4 \ncharges  during  construction  (Table  1).

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR6.53 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. The CTF will cofinance the project with a loan of $48.95 million with a 40-\nyear term, including a grace period of 10 years, a management fee of 0.18% per annum on the \nundisbursed balance of the loan, and an interest charge of 0.25%. ADB will administer the CTF \nloan in accordance with the CTF loan agreement between ADB and the government.  \n \n16.  The government will onlend $17.685 million of the CTF resources to the HCMC PC \nunder a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB and make the \nremaining $31.265 million of the CTF resources available to HCMC PC on a grant basis in \naccordance with the CTF loan agreement and project agreement. The ADB Special Funds \nresources will be available to HCMC PC as a grant in accordance with the Special Operations \nloan agreement and project agreement.  \n \n17.  The ADB loan will finance civil works and interest during construction.14 The CTF loan \nwill  finance  civil  works,  systems,  equipment,  consulting  services,  and  interest  during \nconstruction.

The implementing agency will be the Urban \nTransport Management Department 1 (UTMD1) of the city\u2019s Department of Transport.15 UTMD1 \nwas established in 2002, has strong leadership, a sound organizational structure, and the \ncapability to further develop its institutional capacity to implement and manage an expanding \npublic transport system. UTMD1 has established a project management unit (PMU) for the \nproject under the director. The PMU will be responsible for the day-to-day management and \ncoordination of implementation. The PMU head will ensure compliance with ADB procurement, \ndisbursement, and consulting guidelines and ADB safeguard policies. Capacity development will \nbe  provided  to  strengthen  the  implementation  capacity  of  UTMD1.  The  HCMC  PC  has \nestablished  the  Official  Development  Assistance  Project  Division  to  be  responsible  for \ninternationally financed projects, and to coordinate with other city agencies. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 13).  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2014\u2013December 2019 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2019 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Director  General,  Foreign  External  Relations  Department, \nMinistry of Planning and Investment \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ho Chi Minh City People\u2019s Committee \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  UTMD1 \n(iv)  Implementation unit  PMU to be set up in UTMD1, 16 staff  \nProcurement  International  6 contracts  $32.2 million \ncompetitive bidding \nNational competitive  1 contract  $3.18 million \nbidding \nConsulting services  QCBS  1262 person-months  $9.2 million \nIndividual  36 person-months  $0.2 million \n  All  consulting  services  will  be  financed  by  the  ADB  Clean \nTechnology Fund loan. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to \ntime)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PMU = project management unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, \nUTMD1 = Urban Transport Management Department 1 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                \n15 UTMD1  is  under  the  HCMC  PC\u2019s  Department  of  Transport  but  will  report  directly  to  the  HCMC  PC  for \nimplementation. \n ", "6 \n \n19.  The project implementation schedule will be closely aligned with progress made by \nADB\u2019s  ongoing  MRT  Line  2  project  (footnote  9).  Most  of  the  civil  works  as  well  as  the \nprocurement  of  systems  and  equipment  will  be  carried  out  once  the  MRT  Line  2  station \nconstruction work is near completion, particularly for facilities above the underground stations.16 \nThis will require close coordination between the MRT Line 2 project implementation agency\u2014\nthe  Management  Authority  for  Urban  Railways\u2014and  UTMD1,  as  well  as  between  their \nrespective contractors and consultants. The HCMC PC Official Development Assistance Project \nDivision, chaired by a HCMC PC vice-president, will be responsible for both projects. This will \nensure a high degree of coordination and cooperation. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The  project\u2019s  public  transport  improvement  measures  and  the  MRT  Line  2  station \ninterchange and access facilities will be innovative and are designed to be replicated in other \nparts of the city to make public transit sustainable. Pedestrian access within 500 meters of MRT \nstations, particularly in local alleyways, will be enhanced by upgrading sidewalks. This will \ninclude  protection  measures  for  pedestrian  safety  and  support  for  bicycle  usage.  Physical \nmeasures will include park-and-ride facilities at three stations, bus feeder lines, and dedicated \nparking areas for public transit vehicles. The non-physical measures, such as the station access \nmanagement system, will include controls on parking and the use of public space in and around \nthe stations. The public transport information system will enhance integration between the MRT \nand bus services. \n \n21.  Policies and regulations to support the public transit system will be developed under the \nproject to manage pedestrians and vehicles around the MRT Line 2 stations. UTMD1 and city \ntransport agencies will be introduced to modern multimodal transport and traffic modeling tools \nto enable development of advanced solutions to urban transport problems. The new policies \nand regulations, combined with institutional capacity-building measures, will bring the benefits of \nan integrated, multimodal public transport system to the city and its residents. The combination \nof physical infrastructure and policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms provided by the project \nis expected to increase ridership on MRT Line 2 by more than 10% over current forecast \nridership  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  more  than  15%,  or  the  equivalent  of \n586,500 tons carbon dioxide over the project\u2019s 20-year lifetime over emissions without these \nimprovements. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The main economic benefits will be the reduction of travel time for public transit users \nthrough  improving  proposed  access  and  egress  at  MRT  stations,  less  congestion  around \nstations, enhancing comfort and convenience, and savings in vehicle operating costs due to an \nenvisaged shift from the use of private transport to the public system.17 A reduction in the \ncongestion on city roads, improvements to the environment, and fewer fatalities from accidents \ninvolving private vehicles will be important indirect benefits, even though they are minor in \neconomic terms. The economic analysis estimates the project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \n                                                \n16 Works above the underground MRT Line 2 stations cannot commence until the MRT Line 2 stations reach the final \nstage of surface level works, including road pavement reinstatement. \n17 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n(EIRR) to be 13.3% and the economic net present value discounted at 12% at $4.7 million. \nSensitivity testing showed that the EIRR would remain equal to or above 12% if the capital costs \nrose by not more than 14% over the base case projection, the projected benefits did not fall by \nmore than 13%, or the capital costs rose by 5% and the project benefits fell by 5% at the same \ntime. The project\u2019s economic viability is due largely to assumptions based on projections for \nhigh MRT Line 2 passenger traffic.  \n \n23.  The projected financial internal rate of return is 2.2%, which is above the estimated \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  0.4%.18 This  is  due  mainly  to  revenue  capture  from \npassengers using the MRT Line 2 stations and the very low cost of capital under the ADB CTF \nloan. Use of CTF financing decreases the weighted cost of capital by 1.1%. However, the \nfinancial sustainability of the public transport system faces challenges posed by its current low \nfares, poor revenue capture, inability to recover operational costs, and heavy subsidization. The \nproject  will  support  the  development  and  implementation  of  the  policy,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional reforms that government public transport policy development program needs to \nimplement to address these problems. HCMC\u2019s municipal budget is financed directly through \nnational and city taxes, duties, and other revenue sources.19 HCMC will assign a share of the \npublic transport funding that is within the city\u2019s budget resources for operation and maintenance \nof the project components. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Loan disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements between the government, the \nHCMC PC, and UTMD1. UTMD1 will maintain separate financial records and accounts to \nidentify financing resources received and project expenditures, including goods, works, and \nservices financed out of the loan proceeds and local funds. The loan accounts and related \nfinancial statements will be audited annually, in accordance with sound auditing standards by an \nauditor acceptable to ADB, and made public.  Further details on disbursement, auditing, and \nfinancial management are provided in the PAM, Section V (footnote 13). \n \n25.  A  financial  management  assessment  found  that  UTMD1  has  acceptable  financial \nmanagement  capacity  and  experience  in  managing  and  implementing  similar  projects  but \nlimited experience and knowledge of ADB\u2019s financial management requirements. To improve its \nfinancial  management  capacity  for  implementing  the  project,  UTMD1  will  engage  external \nfinancial management consultants to provide support and assistance to the PMU. The financial \nmanagement consultants will train the PMU\u2019s accounting staff in ADB\u2019s loan disbursement \nprocedures and financial management practices. If needed, UTMD1 will ensure that sufficient \naccounting staff are available for effective  financial management during implementation by \nrecruiting and/or mobilizing extra accountants. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  the  HCMC  PC,  and  UTMD1.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \n \n \n                                                \n18 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The city retains 28% of all national revenue against future budgetary support transfers from Ministry of Finance. \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  A  social  action  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  project,  based  on  a  social  impact \nassessment.20  The smooth accessibility to the MRT Line 2 stations and the integration of the \nMRT with the bus system and other modes of transport will benefit women, students, children, \nand older people, who are identified as the primary users of public transport. By improving the \nareas around MRT Line 2 stations and developing a public transport pricing framework to make \npublic transport fares affordable, the project will improve economies in the MRT Line 2 localities \nby creating business opportunities, reducing congestion, and improving quality of life. The six \nproject districts will benefit from temporary construction jobs and local employment in operations \nand maintenance. \n \n28.  Higher safety risks for the larger numbers of pedestrians expected to travel along roads \nnear the stations constitutes a potential adverse social impact. Pedestrian safety risks will be \nmitigated by providing footbridges and pedestrian subways and good traffic control around the \nstations.  The detailed design will follow universal accessibility and pedestrian safety guidelines. \n \n29.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan is \ndetailed in the PAM (footnote 13). The plan ensures that the detailed design of the project\u2019s \nMRT Line 2 station accessibility elements will include measures to address gender concerns for \nusing public transit services. Proposed measures include women-only waiting spaces at bus \nterminals;  adequate  lighting  around  stations,  bus  stops  and  walkways;  separate  toilets  for \nwomen; and spaces allocated for women vendors to operate around the stations. The public \ntransport information system and transit scheduling are to be based on an analysis that will \nexamine traffic patterns and needs by gender. The plan provides that trip schedules be linked to \nother types of multimodal public transport to support accessibility for women. The plan will \nensure multimodal public transport ticket pricing and an integrated ticketing system to support \naffordability and increase access for women. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Under the ADB and CTF framework agreement, the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) will apply to all project components financed by the CTF. The project is \nassessed as category B for environment. The draft initial environmental examination, which has \nbeen prepared based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, has been reviewed by ADB and is \nbeing revised.21 The approved initial environmental examination will be disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite upon receipt from the HCMC PC. No natural ecosystems exist in the project area, which \nis heavily populated. Land use is predominantly commercial or residential. The project will not \ninvolve major civil works and is not likely to result to significant adverse environmental impacts \nduring construction and operation. Public consultations with affected people were conducted \nduring  preparation  of  the  initial  environmental  examination,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \ninformation  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements.  UTMD1  will  ensure  that  the \nenvironmental management plan is included in all bid documents.  \n \n31.  A grievance redress mechanism will be established prior to commencement of site \nworks. The construction supervision consultant will conduct environmental management training \nfor  UTMD1  in  monitoring  and  reporting  and  help  UTMD1  monitor  the  environmental \nperformance of contractors. \n                                                \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \n32.  The project is assessed as category B for involuntary resettlement. The 1.6 hectares of \nland acquisition required will affect only government-owned land. An estimated 63 roadside \nstalls and small shops with 77 employees near three MRT Line 2 stations will be affected, as \nwell as two gas stations owned by the government and employing 23 people. \n \n33.  A resettlement plan has been prepared that is consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement and relevant legislation and policies in Viet Nam. The draft resettlement plan was \nposted on the ADB website on 1 August 2013 and will be updated following detailed design. \nAffected businesses will be provided with compensation at replacement cost and transitional \nand relocation assistance. One workshop and nine consultation meetings in which 283 affected \nbusiness  owners  and  employees  participated  were  conducted  in  December  2012,  January \n2013, March 2013 and July 2013. The meetings provided an overview of the project and \noutlined  key  elements  of  the  resettlement  plan,  such  as  anticipated  impacts,  mitigation \nmeasures, entitlements, consultation, and the grievance redress mechanism. In July 2013, key \ninformation  from  the  draft  resettlement  plan  was  disclosed  to  all  65  affected  business \nestablishments.  The agreed resettlement plan will be made available in the district offices and \non ADB\u2019s website. All social monitoring reports will be disclosed. The project is assessed as \ncategory C for indigenous peoples\u2019 safeguards. \n \n34.  UTMD1 will be responsible for ensuring compliance with ADB safeguards policies during \nupdating, implementation, and monitoring. UTMD1 will work closely with and provide capacity \nbuilding to HCMC PC, districts\u2019 boards, and wards. The resources to conduct such capacity \nbuilding will be included in the design and construction supervision contract. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  The project faces risks related to its innovative character, demands on executing and \nimplementing agency capacity, dependence on timely execution by and coordination with other \nprojects, and need for effective transport reforms to fully achieve the project impact. These risks \nwill be mitigated through provision of international expert support to UTMD1 for development of \ndesigns, specifications, and project management. In response to UTMD1\u2019s limited experience \nwith ADB guidelines and policies, mitigation measures to address associated public financial \nmanagement and procurement risks, as detailed in the PAM, will require careful monitoring to \nensure effective implementation of proposed support measures. \n \n36.  The project must be sequenced with implementation progress on the MRT Line 2 itself. \nThe implementation delay risk this poses will be mitigated through the government\u2019s institutional \narrangements, project management support, and close coordination with development partners \nsupporting  public  transport.  Because  the  viability  of  the  project  relies  on  achieving  the \npassenger  levels  and  patronage  projected  for  the  MRT  Line  2,  insufficient  government \ncommitment to implement the policy and regulatory reforms under the project to promote a \nmodal shift from private to public transport is a key risk. This will be mitigated by providing \nadvisory services and training to public transport agencies under the project to modernize and \nintegrate the public transport system. The HCMC PC is responsible for ensuring that its plans to \nmodernize the city\u2019s bus fleet and its operations to provide efficient links and an effective \ninterchange  system  with  the  new  MRT  lines  are  developed  on  time.  Risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.22  Overall, \nthe benefits and positive impacts of the project are expected to outweigh any mitigation costs. \n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n37.  The government and the HCMC PC have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents.
