The results of the BDS market survey, \nimplemented in cooperation with the Tongan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the \nMinistry  of  Labor,  Commerce  and  Industries  (MLCI),  were  presented  and  discussed  at  a \nnational stakeholder workshop together with international best practices in BDS. The workshop \ngenerated concrete recommendations on how to develop and strengthen the market for BDS in \nTonga. This not only increased interest among the private sector and the Government but also \nresulted in a participatory project design. During the Country Programming Mission in 2002, the \nGovernment of Tonga requested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide grant funding \nfor  advisory  TA  in  2003  to  support  the  development  of  micro,  small,  and  medium-scale \nenterprises (MSMEs) through BDS. The TA will also build on and strengthen ADB\u2019s ongoing \nsupport for the economic and public sector reform program and the Government\u2019s efforts to \nsupport private sector development in this context.2  \n \n2.  An ADB Fact-Finding Mission3 visited Tonga in August 2002, followed by consultations \nin December 2002 and March 2003. The Mission continued discussions with private sector \norganizations, the business community, BDS providers, and government agencies. The Mission \ntraveled to Vava'u, Ha'apai, and 'Eua for consultations with government officials and the private \nsector. The Mission\u2019s findings and the stakeholder recommendations were presented at a wrap-\nup meeting on 22 August 2002 and are summarized in a memorandum of understanding. The \nTA framework is in Appendix 1, and the summary initial social and poverty analysis is in \nAppendix 2. The Government reconfirmed its strong interest in and support for the TA and \nhighlighted its timeliness.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The key objective of Tonga's national strategic vision is the attainment of a higher \nstandard of living for all Tongans. Achievement of this objective has been limited by low long-\nterm economic growth and by employment growth well below the rate of increase of the labor \nforce. These disappointing developments reflect policy and governance environments that have \ndiscouraged private sector investment. The ADB strategy for Tonga supports the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment  goals  stated  in  its  Strategic  Development  Plan  Seven,  2001\u20132003.    The \nGovernment\u2019s strategic objectives emphasize the need to achieve a steady average gross \ndomestic product growth of around 5% in real terms through a dynamic and competitive \neconomy driven mainly by the private sector and an efficient public sector. \n \n4.  Consistent with the ADB Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium, the strategy for Tonga \nfocuses on the core objectives of (i) promoting economic growth, (ii) fostering good governance, \nand (iii) supporting equitable social development. The achievement of these goals is mainly \nsupported by (i) the Government\u2019s economic and public sector reform program to facilitate \neconomic growth through a stable macroeconomic environment, and enhancing the efficiency \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2000.

An analysis of BDS for MSMEs was carried out in 2002 (footnote 1). The BDS sector \nanalysis included an assessment of the availability and outreach of and the demand for BDS. \nThe quantitative analysis of the demand for BDS is based on a sample survey of 150 MSMEs.7 \nThe sample covered the three main island groups of Tongatapu, Ha'apai, and Vava'u and \nincluded all economic sectors. A qualitative analysis of BDS providers enabled an assessment \nof the supply side.  \n \n6.  The survey revealed that a market for BDS exists, and major BDS types such as \naccounting, legal services, communication, internet services,8 transport services,  advertising, \nvarious training, and consultancy services are available to the business community. Service \nproviders exist for all major service fields. The survey showed substantial spending on BDS by \nthe sample. However, spending is strongly concentrated on a small number of services, namely \ntransport,  communication,  advertising,  and  accounting.  The  BDS  market  is  also  highly \nsegmented: spending substantially exceeds the average (i) on the main island of Tongatapu, \nparticularly in Nuku\u2019alofa; (ii) by medium-scale enterprises; (iii) by joint ventures; and (iv) by the \nmost educated business owners. Spending by micro enterprises, in rural areas, and on the \nouter islands is very low to negligible (Figure 1). \n \n \nFigure 1: Average annual spending on BDS, 2000-2001 (N=150) \n \n By Location in T$                                             B   y  Educational Attainment in T$ \n \n25,000 40,000\n \n20,00 0 30,000  \n15,00 0 20,000\n \n10,000 10,000\n \n5,000 0\n \n 0 <Form 5 Form 5\n Tongatapu  Nuku'alofa Tongatapu  rural Ha'apai Vava'u Form 7 Technical  diploma\n  University grad Postgraduate\n \n7.  Services are provided by public as well as private sector operators. While government \nservice provision by organizations like the Civil Service Training Center, Tonga Trade, the \nCooperative Department, or Tonga Development Bank is visible in the sample, its overall \noutreach is smaller than service provision by private sector firms. Government or aid agency-\ndriven  service  provision  is  typically  concentrated  on  training,  consultancies,  and  trade \npromotion. These services are provided free or at highly subsidized rates, but the market for \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002. Economic and Public Sector Reform Program, Loan 1904-TON(SF), for US$10 million, approved on 28 \nMay 2002. Manila. \n6  An assessment of administrative barriers to private sector investments is being carried out in cooperation with the \nForeign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) under TA 5963-REG.  \n7 A quota sampling procedure for location, enterprise size, and economic sector was used based on the licencing \nregister of MLCI. The survey does not claim to be representative, as it had to also include randomly selected non-\nlicensed microenterprises.  However, major groups and places are represented in the sample. A modified \u201cUsage \u2013 \nAttitude \u2013 Image\u201c survey, a market research tool, was used. The survey was carried out through personal \ninterviews of the sample, which resulted in a 100% response rate.  \n8 Internet services are available on all main island groups. Internet cafes exist in Nuku\u2019alofa and Neiafu. Tonga \nTelecom Corporation has reported a continuous increase in demand.  ", "    3 \nthem is small. In general, buying BDS plays a much bigger role than free service acquisition. \nFree services play only a minor role in trade fairs, business information, and training. \n \n8.  Demand, or the strong expression of interest in BDS, and supply do not always meet. A \nlarge segment of the sample respondents indicated that they do need training and advisory \nservices but are unable to find a suitable supplier. Certain BDS types are perceived as not \navailable, although they are actually on offer by a range of BDS providers. This indicates a \nmismatch between what customers want or can afford and what providers offer. \n \n9.  On one hand, medium-scale businesses, particularly joint ventures or foreign-owned \nenterprises located in the capital, have access to and use a broad range of BDS provided by the \nprivate and the public sector as well as externally funded schemes specifically targeting this \nupper market segment. On the other hand, micro and small enterprises, mainly under Tongan \nownership and management, use BDS to a much lesser extent. For micro businesses and most \nbusinesses on the outer islands, their spending for BDS tends to be equal to their telephone bill \nand some transport cost. Further, no facility addresses the support needs of business starters. \n \n10.  The survey revealed (i) an existing mismatch between demand for and supply of BDS; \n(ii) the underutilization of services, particularly by micro and small enterprises and businesses \nlocated on the outer islands; and (iii) the lack of business education and general support for \npotential entrepreneurs. Hence, deepening the BDS market and increasing the outreach of \nservices are essential for a more dynamic development of MSMEs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA aims to contribute to private sector-led economic growth, increased income, and \nemployment opportunities by promoting MSME development. The TA will facilitate market \ndevelopment for BDS: bridge gaps between existing demand and supply of BDS; deepen the \nmarket to reach micro and small  enterprises; and stimulate demand, particularly in the rural \nareas and outer islands. The purpose of the TA is to improve the performance of existing and \nbudding/start-up micro and small enterprises through their utilization of BDS. Increased use of \nBDS  will  lead  to  improved  competencies  of  new  and  existing  entrepreneurs  and  will \nsubsequently enhance the performance of the enterprises.  The TA will have the following \noutputs: (i) increased outreach and use of BDS by micro and small enterprises, particularly in \nrural  areas  and  the  outer  islands;  (ii)  public  awareness  and  interest  in  entrepreneurship, \nbusiness  development,  and  self-employment;  and  (iii)  availability  of  business  information \nthrough a commercially operated website.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will focus on developing the market for commercially oriented BDS rather than \non   the  supply  of  more subsidized  services.  The  Committee  of  Donor  Agencies  for  Small  \nEnterprise Development9 spearheads the development of this approach following discouraging \nresults of earlier approaches of externally driven and subsidized BDS. Consequently, the TA will \n                                                 \n9  Established in 1979 to (i) exchange information, (ii) share experiences and lessons learned, and (iii) coordinate \nefforts and develop common guidelines for small enterprise promotion. Since 1995, the Committee has distilled \nbest practice in BDS, and has summarized guidelines for project design and monitoring in the publication: \nCommittee of Donor Agencies for Small Enterprise Development. 2001 Edition. Business Development Services \nfor Small Enterprises: Guiding Principles for Donor Intervention. Washington D.C. This publication is also referred \nto as the \"Blue Book.\"  ", "4 \nnot attempt to build institutional capacity in government to continue the activities after TA \ncompletion. By bridging the gap between supply and demand, private sector suppliers of BDS \nwill be able to sustain activities after the TA is completed.  This approach of direct support vis a \nvis capacity building aims at creating a transparent BDS market that does not require further \nsupport.  This is a new and innovative approach to small enterprise promotion. The TA has an \nexperimental character and will, as an additional output, contribute to the ongoing international \ndiscussion on BDS.   \n \n13.  Output  1.  Two  BDS  facilitation  units  will  be  established  in  Nuku'alofa  to  cover \nTongatapu rural and 'Eua, and in Neiafu to cover Vava'u and Ha'apai. These units will be \nconduits between BDS providers (the supply side) and MSMEs (the demand side). A roster of \ncooperating BDS providers and services will be established for referral to MSMEs.  BDS \nproviders will be supported in analyzing the appropriateness of their products and in developing \nnew, and modifying existing, services to respond to the demand. Marketing campaigns jointly \norganized by the TA and BDS providers will raise awareness and expand the market for BDS. \nThe facilitation unit will operate a funding facility to provide incentives for first-time users of BDS \nby sharing the costs of the BDS purchased. Detailed eligibility criteria will be developed with \nrepresentatives of the BDS provider and MSMEs at the beginning of TA implementation. \nUtilization of the fund will be monitored on a quarterly basis, and an impact assessment will be \ncarried out at the end of TA implementation.  \n \n14.  Output 2. In a small and underdeveloped BDS market like Tonga, where demand and \nsupply are concentrated on a small customer segment of medium-scale and urban enterprises, \nmarket development and deepening first of all require demand-side interventions to generate \nand stimulate awareness of and demand for BDS.  Multi media campaigns, workshops, and \nseminars  for  a  wide  range  of  societal  groups  will  be  conducted  to  build  knowledge  and \nunderstanding for business development, self-employment, and entrepreneurial options.  An \ninformation kit on business start-up procedures and basic business education material will be \nprepared. Pilot activities for business start-ups, e.g. training, counseling, and business planning \nin schools, will be implemented with support from BDS providers.   \n \n15.  Output 3.  A website will be set up to provide relevant information on BDS providers as \nwell  as  other  business  information.  The  website  will  offer  advertising  for  BDS  and  other \nbusiness-related  activities.  It  will  contain  basic  information  on  business  start-up, available \nsupport services, and the legal requirements and regulatory environment. All organizations \nproviding or demanding relevant business information will be encouraged to participate in and \ncontribute to this website. A business plan for the website operation will be designed based on \ncost recovery and transfer to a private operator. The facilitating units will offer introductory \ncourses on how to access and use the internet and the BDS home page.  \n \n16.  The  TA  is  based  on  several  assumptions,  which  are  crucial  for  its  successful \nimplementation. It is assumed that (i) the support to develop the BDS market will be attractive to \na sufficient number of BDS providers; (ii) sociocultural factors and the reliance on remittances \nwill not prevent individual entrepreneurial initiative, so that young people in particular will be \nmotivated for self-employment and small business opportunities; (iii) an increasing number of \nMSMEs will already have access to internet facilities; and (iv) a sufficient number of BDS \nproviders will be interested and willing to participate and contribute to the website. \n \n17.  Comprehensive performance and impact monitoring and evaluation form part of this TA. \nResults and lessons learned will be disseminated to all stakeholders and to the Committee of \nDonor Agencies for Small Enterprise Development to further the international discussion on best ", "    5 \npractices in SME development and BDS. Indicators have been formulated to enable a cost-\nbenefit assessment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The cost of the TA is estimated at US$313,000 equivalent, of which US$72,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and US$241,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance US$250,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange \ncost and US$178,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's TA funding program. The Government will provide (i) radio and television time \nfor (a) awareness creation and social marketing of entrepreneurship and business development, \nand (b) marketing of BDS;  (ii) office space in Nuku'alofa and Vava'u; and (iii) counterpart staff. \nThe TA will finance (i) international and domestic consulting services; (ii) office and computer \nequipment; (iii) training, a workshop, and conferences; (iv) a BDS funding facility; and (v) \nsurveys and awareness campaigns. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MLCI will be the Executing Agency of the TA. MLCI will chair the project coordinating \ncommittee, whose membership will comprise suppliers and customers of BDS as well as \nrepresentatives  of  business  associations.  A  BDS  facilitation  unit  will  be  established  in \nNuku'alofa with a branch office in Neiafu. These units will be located outside any cooperating \norganization to ensure and reflect their independence. To facilitate the smooth implementation \nof the TA, an advance payment facility will be established with MLCI in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Disbursement of TA Grants. The advance amount will be up to US$70,000 \nequivalent  for  the  expenditures  of  office  and  computer  equipment,  training,  seminars, \nconferences, awareness campaigns, and cost-shared BDS services. \n  \n20.  The individual consultants, one international and two domestic, will have specialization in \n(i) BDS funding facilities; (ii) small enterprise development; and (iii) business education and \nmarketing. The consultants' terms of reference are in Appendix 4. The TA will be implemented \nover a period of 36 months beginning in May 2003.  The international consultant (1 person-\nmonth) will design the BDS funding facility and backstop its implementation. Two domestic \nconsultants for a total of 72 person-months will (i) manage the BDS facilitation units, (ii) build a \nnetwork of BDS providers, (iii) carry out BDS market research, (iv) run awareness and BDS \nmarketing campaigns, (v) administer the BDS funding facility, and (vi) design and manage a \nbusiness information website. The small enterprise specialist/team leader will submit a quarterly \nprogress report and a draft final report within 2 weeks after completion of the assignment. The \nexpected TA completion date is April 2006. The individual consultants will be selected and \nengaged by ADB in accordance with its  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Procurement \nunder the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of US$250,000 on a grant basis \nto the Government of Tonga for Business Development Services, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board.
