The International Public Sector Accounting Standard Board (IPSASB) is a standards-\nsetting body operating under the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).1 The principal \nactivity of the IPSASB is to develop financial reporting standards for public sector entities, with \nthe aim of moving toward full-fledged accrual accounting for both developed and developing \ncountries. The IPSASB plays a critical role in enhancing the quality and transparency of public \nsector financial reporting; promoting adoption of, or convergence with, the International Public \nSector Accounting Standards (IPSAS); and providing guidance for first-time adoption of IPSAS \nin the public sector. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing regional technical assistance \n(TA) for IPSASB\u2019s work program since 1997 (in four phases).2 IFAC has requested ADB and its \nother development partners to continue financing its ongoing initiatives of IPSAS development. \nRecognizing that the development of a high-quality financial reporting standard is a long-term \nprocess, the developing partners continue to support IPSASB, along with IFAC, which remains \nthe largest fund provider. \n \n3.  Following the successful completion of the first four phases, this TA proposes to support \nthe  IPSASB  work  program  for  2013  to  2015.  The  strategic  priorities  of  the  program  are \n(i) developing a public sector conceptual framework, (ii) developing standards and guidance on \npublic  sector  critical  projects,  and  (iii)  communicating  and  promoting  the  adoption  and \nimplementation of IPSAS. \n \n4.  The TA aims to facilitate, in the long run, accounting policy reform, accountability, and \ncapacity strengthening in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs); and to improve the \npublic sector accounting system. Improvements in public sector accounting standards will be \ninstrumental for DMCs to achieve good governance. This is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n20203 and its development agenda on good governance, anticorruption, and an enhanced \ngovernment financial management system. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  At  completion  of the fourth  phase  of  the TA, the IPSASB  identified three  strategic \nthemes that will guide its activities during 2013 to 2015. The projects below need to be finalized \nas a priority.  \n \n(i)  Developing  public  sector  conceptual  framework.  As  the  IPSASB\u2019s  most \nimportant project, developing a public sector conceptual framework is critical to \nestablish credibility as the international public sector accounting standard setter. \n                                                \n1  IFAC, a global organization for the accountancy profession, was established in 1973 and was formally approved by \nthe International Congress of Accountants in 1977. The IFAC board established the public sector committee in \n1986 to issue pronouncements on accounting, auditing, and reporting in the public sector. Effective 10 November \n2004, the IPSAS board replaced the public sector committee. \n2  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance for Government Accounting Standards. Manila (TA 5748-REG, for $245,000); \nADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Government Accounting Standards (Second Phase). Manila (TA 6052-REG, \nfor $245,000); ADB. 2006.

Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "2 \nThe framework will provide concepts, definitions, and principles that will underpin \nthe development of the IPSAS. \n \n(ii)   Other  public  sector  critical  projects.  The  IPSASB  continues  to  develop \nstandards and guidance in areas considered critical for the public sector. Projects \ninclude  public  sector  specific  reporting  issues  where  there  is  no  equivalent \naccounting  standard  in  the  private  sector  (e.g.,  reporting  on  the  long-term \nsustainability  of  public  finances),  and  convergence  with  statistical  bases. \nMaintaining the quality of the existing standards and adequate ongoing resources \nis also an important issue.4 \n \n(iii)  Promoting  adoption  and  implementation  of  International  Public  Sector \nAccounting Standards. Over the past 5 years, adoption of the IPSAS has been \na growing trend around the world. Over 80 countries have either adopted or have \nprocesses in place to adopt the IPSAS. As a result, significant resources are \nneeded for outreach activities and communication programs. For instance, the \nIPSASB issued a study guide intended to provide additional resources for IPSAS \nadopters.  IFAC  is  developing  a  comprehensive  training  course  and  teaching \nmaterials as part of its adoption and implementation initiative. These will be the \nfirst  steps  toward  capacity  development  in  DMCs,  where  it  is  generally \nconsidered insufficient to fully implement the accrual basis IPSAS. \n \n6.  In addition to the priority projects, the current environment highlights the urgency for \nrobust financial reporting standards in the public sector. Recent sovereign debt crises around \nthe world are a result of poor financial management and public sector financial reporting. Lack \nof reliable information about government finances is an area of major concern, leading to \ngrowing demands for improved government financial reporting, government accountability, and \nsustainability of key government programs. High-quality public accounting standards, adoption, \nand implementation guidance must be developed to address these fundamental issues. \n \n7.  Governments that report on a cash basis do not account for significant liability, such as \npensions and infrastructure development. The IPSASB encourages public sector entities to \nadopt the accrual basis of accounting, which will improve financial management and increase \ntransparency, resulting in a more comprehensive and accurate view of a government\u2019s financial \nposition. A significant number of DMCs that use cash basis national standards have plans to \nadopt or are in transition toward accrual basis IPSAS. To date, 33 countries in Asia and the \nPacific and nine non-regional ADB member countries have adopted or are adopting accrual-\nbased  IPSAS,  or  converging  their  national  standards  to  the  IPSAS-based  accounting \nframework.5 \n \n8.  One of the major achievements of the prior phases of the TA is the successful funding of \nthe standards programs. Since the standards development work began in 1997, 32 accrual \n                                                \n4  International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board Work Plan, 2013-2015 (supplementary appendix, available \nupon request). \n5  The following countries in Asia and the Pacific have adopted or are adopting the IPSAS: Afghanistan; Armenia; \nAustralia; Azerbaijan; Bangladesh; Bhutan; Cambodia; the People\u2019s Republic of China; the Fiji Islands; Hong Kong, \nChina; India; Indonesia; Japan; Kazakhstan; the Republic of Korea; the Kyrgyz Republic; the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic; Malaysia; the Maldives; Mongolia; Nepal; New Zealand; Pakistan; the Philippines; Singapore; \nSolomon Islands; Sri Lanka; Tajikistan; Thailand; Turkmenistan; Uzbekistan; Vanuatu; and Viet Nam.  \n  The following non-regional member countries of ADB have adopted or are adopting or converging to the IPSAS: \nAustria, Canada, France, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \n \n ", "  3 \nstandards and one cash-basis standard have been issued. The first phase of convergence \nproject with the International Financial Reporting Standards was completed in 2009. This set the \nstage for the next phase of the work program, which focused on public sector projects. A major \nlesson  learned  from  prior  phases  is  that  capacity  building  in  the  DMC  public  accounting \nprofession continues to be a challenge in moving toward full accrual basis accounting, and \nrequires robust system support to accommodate implementation. This is foreseen as a long-\nterm process, requiring ADB\u2019s continued support. The TA will closely monitor the progress of \nthe IPSASB\u2019s work programs as well as DMCs\u2019 initiatives toward the adoption of accrual basis \nIPSAS. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of this TA will be improved public financial reporting and management in \nDMCs, which will result in improved governance, accountability, and transparency in public \nsector financial reporting and accounting systems. \n \n10.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  adoption  of  IPSAS  (or  IPSAS-based  accounting \nframework) by DMCs. This will include progress made in full or partial adoption, or convergence \nof national public sector accounting standards with the IPSAS. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: (i) development of new \nIPSAS  and  enhancement  of  existing  IPSAS,  (ii)  development  of  public  sector  conceptual \nframework, and (iii) development of long-term capacity building programs to promote the IPSAS \nand strengthen the accountancy profession. \n \n12.  Issuance of the finalized IPSAS, especially those considered critical for the public sector, \ntogether  with  a  robust  public  sector  conceptual  framework,  will  provide  a  foundation  for \ngovernments and jurisdictions to benchmark and improve their existing financial management \nframework.  Long-term  capacity  building  programs\u2014such  as  training,  guidance,  and  other \nresources  to  aid  implementation  of  the  IPSAS\u2014are  paramount  for  DMC  governments  to \nconsider adoption of, or convergence with, the IPSAS. \n \n13.   The key activities of the fifth phase of the TA are to (i) develop consultation papers and \nexposure drafts of the new IPSAS in the pipeline (contained in the supplementary appendix) for \npublic comments; (ii) review and enhance the existing IPSAS; (iii) finalize the pending final \nchapters of the public sector conceptual framework; (iv) implement communication strategies to \npromote the IPSAS; and (v) continue collaboration with IFAC, the International Accounting \nStandards Board (IASB), and other national standard setters to develop capacity development \nprograms that will strengthen the global accounting profession. \n \n14.  As the IPSASB is competent in the subject area, no major technical project risks are \nexpected. However, since the scope of work will expand with limited resources, the IPSASB \nmay not be able to allocate sufficient resources to certain projects that may have particular \nimportance to DMC governments. Such risk will be mitigated through prioritization of critical \nprojects and public consultation on the IPSASB\u2019s work program. \n    \n ", "4 \n15.  ADB is one of six donors that will finance the IPSASB budget to carry out the work plan \nof the fifth phase. IFAC remains the largest financier of the IPSASB, funding over 65% of the \ntotal estimated costs. Collaboration carries the risk that the IPSASB work plan may become \nunsustainable if any donor fails to commit its funding.6 Such risk is mitigated by obtaining a \nrepresentation letter from IFAC stating that the other donors, along with ADB, are committed to \ntheir funding for the period and that any shortfall will be covered by IFAC\u2019s own resources. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $6,844,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \n17.  Other organizations providing parallel financing on a grant basis of $1,957,500 are (i) the \nWorld Bank, $187,500; (ii) the Government of Canada, $600,000; (iii) CPA Canada (formerly the \nCanadian Institute of Chartered Accountants), $525,000; (iv) the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, $420,000 (in kind); and (v) the Government of New Zealand, $225,000. IFAC \nwill provide the remaining funding requirement of $4,586,500. Appendix 2 contains the cost \nestimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements    \n18.  IFAC will be the executing agency for the TA. As ADB will contribute only 4.4% of the \nIPSASB 2013-2015 work program budget, it would be efficient to use IFAC\u2019s organizational and \nadministrative  procedures.  For  the  previous  four  phases  of  the  TA,  the  procurement \narrangements were such that all services7 to be financed out of ADB funds were procured in \naccordance  with  the  standard  procedures  of  IFAC.  No  goods  or  consulting  services  are \nanticipated to be procured under this TA. ADB funds will be used to finance expenditures \nrelated  to  international  travel  of  IPSASB  members  and  meetings,  conferences,  seminars, \nworkshops conducted by IFAC and other administrative support costs. IFAC will ensure that \nthese expenditures are incurred in the territories of ADB member countries and for services and \nfacilities supplied from such territories with due consideration of economy and efficiency. These \narrangements have proven to work well and will continue in this phase. IFAC will implement the \nTA through the IPSASB.  \n \n19.  TA implementation will commence in December 2013 and is expected to be completed \nin October 2016. The ADB funds will be released in three installments, each amounting to \n$100,000. The first installment will be released upon receipt by ADB of the TA Letter Agreement \ncountersigned on behalf of IFAC. The two subsequent installments will be released based on \nthe submission of (i) a financial statement of accounts, showing the use of grant funds from \nvarious  funding  agencies;  (ii)  audited  financial  statements  of  IFAC,  with  supplementary \ninformation on the IPSASB projects; and (iii) an annual progress report on the project activities \nsupported by the TA. IFAC will maintain separate records of ADB financing, and provide the \nfollowing to ADB within 6 months of the fiscal year in which the funds are utilized: an annual \nprogress report and audited financial statements.  \n \n20.  ADB will maintain an observer status in IPSASB meetings. The Controller\u2019s Department \nwill monitor and oversee the TA activities, and provide, as needed, direct input to the work of \n                                                \n6  ADB does not administer other donors\u2019 funds that are not channeled through ADB. As such, this is a collaboration \nand is not considered a cofinancing arrangement. \n7  Those services did not include consulting services. \n ", "  5 \nIPSASB by reviewing the consultation papers and exposure drafts, and ensuring that ADB \nmember countries\u2019 comments are addressed before the final standards and guidelines are \nissued.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding $300,000 on a grant basis for Public Sector \nAccounting Standards (Fifth Phase), and hereby reports this action to the Board.   \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \n  DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance \nTargets and  Data Sources and \n  Indicators with  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \n       \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved public sector  Increased number of  IFAC annual progress  IPSASB is competent in \nfinancial reporting  DMCs adopting  reports on IPSASB  this area and will deliver the \nmanagement and  IPSAS or IPSAS-  required results \nenhanced accountability  based standards \nand transparency in \npublic sector financial \nreporting and \naccounting systems \n \n       \nOutcome      Assumption \nAdoption of IPSAS or  Number of DMCs  IFAC annual progress  IPSASB is committed to \nIPSAS-based  adopting IPSAS-  reports  achieving the TA goals \naccounting framework  based standards     \nby DMCs  increases   IFAC annual financial  Risk \n  statements  Capacity development is a \nNumber of DMCs    long-term process and no \nadopting IPSAS or  IFAC audit report  immediate benefit could be \nconverging national    achieved \npublic sector  IFAC completion report    \naccounting standards     \nto IPSAS increases  IPSASB website listing \n  countries that have \nadopted or are adopting \nIPSAS \n       \nOutputs    Assumption \nIPSASB accounting \n(i) Development and  Issuance of new  Funds are available for \nstandards documents \nenhancements of  IPSAS  IPSASB to carry out its \n \naccrual basis IPSAS     work plan for the next \nIPSASB project records \n  Existing IPSAS  3 years \n \n  revised and improved   \nIPSASB accounting \n    Risk \nstandards training \n(ii) Development of  Conceptual  Capacity development \nrecords \npublic sector conceptual  framework published  program is reduced or \nframework     deferred because of lack of \n    financing \n(iii) Development of  Number of \nlong-term capacity  government officials \nbuilding programs to  accredited after \npromote IPSAS and  IPSAS training \nstrengthen the  courses \naccountancy profession   \n \n   \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.
