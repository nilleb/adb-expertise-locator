The Government of Viet Nam (the Government) has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA)1 to support the preparation of the Central Region \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. The TA supports the National Rural Clean \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Strategy  (NRWSS)  up  to  2020,2 the  Comprehensive  Poverty \nReduction  and  Growth  Strategy,  and  Viet  Nam\u2019s  commitment  to  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals for rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS). A TA Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited Viet Nam and reached agreement with the Government on TA impacts, outcome, outputs, \nactivities, cost, implementation and financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA is \nincluded in the Viet Nam country strategy and program (CSP) 2007\u20132010.3 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In recent years, Viet Nam has made significant progress in improving rural residents\u2019 \nreliable access to clean water. About 19 million (30%) of rural households currently have access \nto  clean  water,  as  defined  by  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  standards.4 However,  many  rural \nresidents  still  rely  on  shallow  wells,  ponds,  and  streams,  which  are  often  biologically \ncontaminated. In some cases, women and children spend an hour daily collecting water from \ndistant sources. Significant differences in the coverage and quality of RWSS services exist \namong different regions and income groups.  \n \n3.  Rural sanitation in Viet Nam follows a comparable trend. By the end of 2006, about 6.4 \nmillion rural households used hygienic latrines, compared with only 2.7 million in 1999. However, \nhalf of rural residents lack proper toilet facilities and use open ground, fields, local drains, and \nwatercourses for disposing of excreta and wastewater. Only 17% of rural markets provide \naccess to public toilets and clean water, and less than 70% of schools and kindergartens, and \nonly 58% of commune health stations, have proper latrines. Raising rural awareness of safe \nwater,  sanitation,  and  hygienic  practices  will  require  effective  information,  education,  and \ncommunication (IEC) campaigns and increased resources. Efforts are also required to promote \nand market sanitary latrines through cooperation with nongovernment organizations and the \nprivate sector. IEC funds need to be decentralized from provinces to districts and communes \nand supported by training programs. MOH should monitor the effectiveness of IEC approaches. \n \n4.  The Government is committed to improving water supply and sanitation services in rural \nareas  in  terms  of  access,  quality,  reliability,  and  sustainability.  In  2001,  the  Government \nlaunched its NRWSS, which sets as targets safe water supply for 85% of the rural population by \n20105 and 100% by 2020. It also sets a target of 70% of rural households using hygienic latrines \nand practicing good personal hygiene by 2010 and 100% by 2020. In 1998, the Government \nissued a decision6 to establish the National Target Program I for Rural Clean Water Supply and \nEnvironmental Hygiene (NTP I). The achievements and problems encountered in implementing \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 May 2008. \n2  Promulgated in Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. 104 (25 August 2000). \n3  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Viet Nam. Manila. \n4  Decision 09/2005/QD-BYT. \n5  Of which, half (42.5% of the rural total) will have access to clean water as defined by MOH standards. \n6  Decision No. 237 (3 December 1998). \n ", "2   \nNTP I were evaluated in 2005, and a report7 was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture and \nRural Development (MARD).  \n \n5.  Based on the results of evaluations for first 5 years of implementation, the Government \nestablished in March 2006 the NTP II, which identifies water supply and sanitation needs and \ntargets for rehabilitating, expanding, or developing facilities in rural areas up to 2010. The NTP II \nhas guided sector development over the past 2 years, including investments funded by the \nGovernment and development partners. A review of NTP II implementation will be prepared in \nOctober 2008. The NRWSS will be updated in 2008 to reflect the Government\u2019s increasing \nemphasis on sanitation and community participation in view of concerns about food safety and \ninfectious disease. The NTP II provides a balanced, stepwise approach to RWSS development \nwith increased focus on sanitation, giving a much bigger role to MOH than did NTP I in the \nimplementation of sanitation and hygiene campaigns.  \n \n6.  Significant  investments  are  required  to  improve  RWSS.  The  NTP  II  estimates  that \nD22,600,000 million ($1.4 billion) will be required for the period 2006\u20132010, with D3,400,000 \nmillion ($210 million) to be financed by international development partners. The operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of RWSS infrastructure needs to be improved, and community and private \nsector participation in managing facilities needs to be strengthened to improve sustainability. \nLow coverage of safe water supply, poor sanitation conditions, and unhygienic practices worsen \nthe frequency and severity of such water-related diseases as diarrhea and cholera and are \nmajor determinants of child morbidity and mortality among the poor and vulnerable.  \n \n7.  Several development partners support RWSS in Viet Nam. With ADB support, MARD \nlaunched RWSS partnership with all development partners in November 2005 to improve donor \ncoordination. The Danish International Development Assistance (Danida), the Australian Agency \nfor  International  Development  (AusAID),  and  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  currently \nsupport  the  NTP  II  through  the  implementation  of  the  Sector  Program  Support  to  Water, \nSanitation, and Hygiene Promotion. This program provides budgetary support with grants of \n$125 million for a 5-year period8 and $8 million in TA for nine provinces and includes several \nbenchmarks and triggers for Government compliance with reform of the sector. The program will \nbe  evaluated  in  October  2008,  at  the  end  of  its  2-year  pilot  phase.  The  World  Bank  is \nimplementing an RWSS project in four provinces of the Red River delta and is preparing a \nsecond phase of the project to cover eight additional provinces. \n \n8.  The CSP prioritizes rural infrastructure development, including RWSS, for the strategic \nfocus on social equity and balanced development in Viet Nam. The TA and ensuing project will \nalso support the CSP\u2019s strategic focus on environment through the improvement of RWSS \nfacilities and sanitation and hygiene education. The TA and ensuing project will complement \nother ADB interventions in the North Central and South Central regions. These regions have \nlower access to water facilities than the national average at all income levels, and for the poor in \nparticular. Only 12.9% of the poorest 20% households in the North Central Region and 16.0% in \nthe South Central Region have access to clean water, compared with the national average for \npoor households of 22.7% (footnote 7). In these two regions together, more than 3 million poor \nare without access to clean water. \n \n                                                 \n7  MARD. 2005.

Lessons identified from past experiences of ADB and other development partners include \nthe need to: \n(i)  involve communities in identifying appropriate RWSS technologies and designs \nto help them understand the links between water and sanitation toward improving \nhealth and hygiene, generate demand for sanitation facilities, and improve the \nO&M of facilities;  \n(ii)  assess and strengthen human and institutional capacity in provinces, districts, and \ncommunes to promote the decentralization of RWSS O&M services; \n(iii)  devote sufficient resources to raw water assessments to minimize water treatment \ncosts and the risk of water shortages; \n(iv)  prepare  comprehensive  RWSS  projects  that  support  water  and  sanitation \nmeasures, community participation, health awareness, and the preparation in the \nlocal language of training and O&M manuals for facilities; and \n(v)  establish a database on water quality and quantity with baseline indicators and \neffective monitoring and evaluation systems.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA is the improved and sustainable use of water supply and sanitation \nfacilities and the adoption of safe hygiene practices by the rural population in the project area. It \nwill contribute to the Government\u2019s goal of providing safe water to 85% of residents in rural \nareas, and for 70% of the rural households to use hygienic latrines and practice good personal \nhygiene, by 2015. This is expected to contribute to reducing the incidence of water-related \ndiseases in the project area, particularly benefiting women and children. \n \n11.  The outcome of the TA is a sector project and a set of policy reform recommendations to \ndevelop RWSS and improve environmental conditions in six priority provinces in the North \nCentral and South Central regions. This is expected to improve water supply and sanitation \nservices for rural residents, in particular for women, in terms of access, quality, reliability, and \nsustainability.  The  TA  supports  the  preparation  of  a  sector  project  that  will  help  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts toward achieving the Viet Nam Millennium Development Goals for water \nsupply and sanitation, with particular attention to sanitation. It will also assess the possibility of \nproviding support through a sector-wide approach. The TA is consistent with and supports \nMARD\u2019s policies and programs as outlined in its NRWSS and the NTP II. An initial poverty and \nsocial analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The TA will have the following outputs: (i) a national RWSS analysis including a sector \nprofile, evaluation of sector institutions,9 policies, strategies and plans, and recommendations to \nfurther  strengthen  the  sector\u2019s  regulatory,  planning,  and  management  capacity;  (ii)  an \nassessment of a potential sector-wide approach to intervention and the identification of triggers \nand benchmarks;10 (iii) the identification of investments sites in the six provinces, applying need- \nand demand-based criteria, including the incidence of poverty, water and sanitation coverage, \nand the availability of safe and adequate surface and groundwater sources; (iv) the formulation \nof a typology of subprojects, including ranking and screening criteria, and the  identification of \n                                                 \n9  Particular attention will be paid to assessing the roles of responsibilities of different institutions at the national, \nprovincial, district, and commune levels and recommending ways to improve decentralization. \n10  The TA will closely coordinate with AusAID, Danida, and the Government of the Netherlands to assess the \npossibility of a sector-wide approach for budgetary support to the NTP II, based on the evaluation of the pilot phase \nof the Sector Program Support to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Promotion. \n ", "4   \nsix  core  subprojects  representing  a  cross  section  of  the  geographical  area  previously \ndetermined;  (v)  the  preparation  of  feasibility  studies  for  the  six  core  subprojects;  (vi)  the \ndevelopment of an overall sector investment project including scope, cost estimates, financing \nplan,  implementation  arrangements,  flow  of  funds  mechanism,  assessment  of  risks  and \nmitigation  measures,  and  economic,  financial,  social,  and  environmental  analysis;  and  (vii) \nappraisal of private sector participation in RWSS to identify potential public-private partnership \ndemonstration initiatives in rural areas. The TA will develop a typology of water supply projects \nsuch as wells, tube wells, ponds with treatment facilities, small piped-water systems, household \nfilters, improved rainwater-harvesting systems, and small-scale private and public sanitation \nsystems. It will design a campaign to raise awareness of water use and hygiene issues. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The RWSS sector analysis will consider previous assessments prepared by ADB and \npartners and add value to them by exploring issues that they did not study in detail. The \nfeasibility study and sector project design will build on the preliminary lessons identified from \nother ongoing RWSS projects and programs, as well as rural development projects, and include \nimprovements. General socioeconomic data and information on the RWSS situation of each \nparticipating province will be included in the inception report. The TA will assess the economic \njustification and feasibility of providing budgetary support to the NTP II in conjunction with \ndevelopment partners and identify key policy, institutional, financial management issues, as well \nas triggers and benchmarks for consideration by ADB and the Government during the inception \nphase.  \n \n14.  The feasibility study of core RWSS subprojects will be done in two phases. During phase \n1, the consultants will conduct an initial review and develop a shortlist of about 10\u201312 areas for \nsample  RWSS  subprojects.  Based  on  initial proposals  from  participating  provinces,  priority \nareas will be evaluated against the Government priorities, ongoing provincial support provided \nby development partners in the sector, stakeholder consultations, and site inspections. During \nphase 2, feasibility studies will be conducted for a sample of six subprojects, one from each \nprovince selected from the shortlist. The feasibility studies for each subproject will include \nfinancial,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  analyses,  including  gender,  minority,  and \nresettlement safeguards.   \n \n15.  Consultants\u2019 key activities will include surveys, reviews, and assessments for delivering \nspecified TA outputs; a series of stakeholder consultations and TA workshops to disseminate \ninformation  and  seek  consensus  on  project  design;  and  the  preparation  of  TA  reports. \nParticipatory planning and appraisal techniques will be used to understand community priorities \nand perceptions regarding RWSS. ADB will hold dialogue with the Government on policy and \ninstitutional changes proposed under the TA, and with development partners to avoid overlap \nand duplication in RWSS investments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is expected to be $750,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $150,000  in  kind, \ncovering the costs of office accommodation, transport, and utilities; remuneration for counterpart \nstaff; and training and workshop facilities. The Government has been informed that approval of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost estimates and financing \narrangements are in Appendix 3. \n ", "  5\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MARD will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A project management unit (PMU) will be \nestablished within the Center for Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation (CERWASS), \nwhich is under the authority of MARD. Provincial project implementation units (PIUs) will be \nestablished at the end of the TA inception phase in each participating province. The national PMU \nwill be responsible for the day-to-day coordination and monitoring of TA activities and will provide \nguidance to consultants, facilitate stakeholder workshops, and supervise surveys. The PMU will \ninclude a full-time project director, deputy director, and accountant. The PIUs will facilitate TA \nimplementation in the provinces. To provide overall guidance for the TA, a steering committee will \nbe established and chaired by the vice minister of MARD, with representatives of the international \ncooperation, water resources, and planning departments of MARD, CERWASS, NTP II standing \noffice, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, State Bank of Viet Nam, and \nPreventive Medicine Department of MOH. \n \n18.  A team of five international and six national consultants will be recruited to provide \nspecialized services totaling 33 person-months (13 international and 20 national). The team of \nconsultants will be engaged as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (January 2007, as amended from time to time), following the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method and using a simplified technical proposal. International consultants will \ninclude the (i) team leader and expert on rural water supply and sanitation (6.5 person-months); \n(ii)  economist  and  financial  specialist  (2  person-months),  (iii)  social  development  and \nresettlement specialist (2 person-months), (iv) environment specialist (1.5 person-months), and \nsocial survey specialist (1 person-month). National consultants include the (i) deputy team \nleader and water supply engineer (7 person-months), (ii) gender and social development expert \n(4  person-months),  (iii)  resettlement  expert  (2  person-months),  (iv)  environment  expert  (2 \nperson months), (v) social survey and data collection expert (3 person-months), and (vi) RWSS \nprivate sector specialist (2 person-months). The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 7 months, from December 2008 to June 2009. The \nconsultant will submit an inception report within 1 month of TA start-up, which will propose the \nmethodology for carrying out activities for the full TA duration and recommendations for priority \nprovinces. An interim report, which will incorporate survey findings, a draft feasibility study, and \nan assessment of the possibilities for budgetary support, will be submitted within 3 months of TA \nimplementation. A draft final report will be submitted within 5 months of TA implementation. The \nfinal report will incorporate comments from the Government and ADB and will be submitted at \nthe end of TA implementation. Tripartite meetings of the Government, ADB, and the consultant \nteam will be held during the inception, midterm, and completion phases of the TA. Key findings \nand outputs of the TA will be disseminated by workshops and stakeholder discussions. All \nequipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) and will be given to CERWASS at the end of TA implementation. \n. \nIV.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nProject preparatory technical assistance (TA) was included in the Viet Nam country strategy and program 2007\u2013\n2010a as a firm TA for 2008. The TA will help develop a sector project that supports the National Rural Clean Water \nSupply and Sanitation (RWSS) Strategy up to the year 2020 and the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth \nStrategy of the Government of Viet Nam (the Government). The Government\u2019s RWSS Strategy sets the target of \nsupplying clean water to 85% of the rural population by 2010 and 100% by 2020. It also sets a target of 70% of rural \nhouseholds using hygienic latrines and practicing good personal hygiene. The National Target Plan II lists the RWSS \nneeds of rehabilitation, expansion, or development. The TA is aligned with the Socioeconomic Development Strategy \n2001\u20132010, which highlights the Government\u2019s commitment to increasing the distribution of sanitized water to the \npopulation in rural areas for poverty reduction. The 5-year Socioeconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 specifies \nthe directions and tasks of the 10-year strategy, especially clean water and sanitation facilities in schools, public \nplaces,  and  homes  in  rural  areas.  The  TA  supports  Viet  Nam\u2019s  commitment  to  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) for RWSS by 2015.  \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, \nM2, etc.) \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification: The RWSS sector plays a significant role in reducing poverty. \nReliable access to safe water is a fundamental human need, and the lack of clean water affects people\u2019s physical \nand social health. The effects of low coverage of safe water supply and poor sanitation conditions are seen in the \nfrequency of water-related disease outbreaks (e.g., diarrhea and cholera), severity of illness, and subsequent death. \nLack of clean water, inadequate sanitation and unhygienic practices are the main causes of disease. Improved water \nsupply and sanitation helps reduce poverty and improve opportunities, especially for women and young girls through \n(i) time and costs saved in purchasing, collecting, treating, and storing water; (ii) improved health and hygiene; and \n(iii) increased access to income-generating and schooling opportunities. Improved water supply and sanitation \nreduce the risk of water-related and environmental diseases, which have high economic and social consequences for \nindividuals and households (e.g., high medical expenses and lost working days).  \nC.  Poverty Analysis \nA poverty and social analysis (PSA) will be required to support the overall design of the sector project and the \nfeasibility studies of sample subprojects. The analysis will assess the poverty and social conditions of the population \nin about six provinces that will be selected for sector project design and feasibility. The analysis will (i) determine the \ntypes of impacts\u2014positive or negative\u2014on different population groups; (ii) identify measures to reduce the risk of \nnegative effects on population groups from land acquisition and resettlement and on the environment; and (iii) \nidentify enhancement measures that could support ongoing government programs and/or specific project activities \nfor more equitable project outcomes. The analysis will build on lessons from previous projects implemented by other \ndevelopment partner in RWSS in Viet Nam. In addition, the analysis should include a review of experiences from \ncommunity and pro-poor components that have been designed for past ADB-supported projects in urban water \nsupply and environmental improvements. The PSA will include information on ethnic groups and gender. Data will be \ndisaggregated by poverty level, gender, and ethnic group. A comprehensive PSA will inform the project-preparation \nprocess and help identify opportunities for an enhanced project design that is pro-poor and community driven. \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA. Initial Social Analysis \nThe Government has made significant progress in improving reliable access to safe water for residents in rural \nareas. In 1998, about 17 million of the rural population had access to safe water. Currently, approximately 40 million \npeople, or about 62% of the rural population, have access to safe water, of which 30% of households are supplied \nwith clean water as defined by Ministry of Health standards. The number of rural households using hygienic latrines \nincreased to 6.4 million by the end of 2005 from 2.7 million in 1999.  \n \nThe TA will focus on preparing a sector project that covers six provinces in the Northern Central and Southern \nCentral regions of Viet Nam. Improving RWSS systems in these two regions is a high priority. The Southern Central \nRegion includes eight provinces, and the Northern Central Region includes six provinces. Based on existing \ninformation, the primary beneficiaries of the TA and ensuing project will be rural residents, especially women and \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \ngirls. Many rural residents often rely on shallow wells, ponds, and streams, which are often biologically contaminated. \nWomen and children may spend as much as 1\u20132 hours each day collecting water from distant sources. Half of rural \nresidents do not have proper toilet facilities and use open ground, fields, drains, and watercourses for disposal of \nexcreta and wastewater. Public sanitation facilities are limited, as only 70% of schools and kindergartens and 58% of \ncommune health stations have proper latrines, and only 17% of rural markets provide access to public toilets and \nclean water. Public awareness and materials have been developed in the past and aim to change behavior in proper \nwater use and improved hygiene. A review of these materials and communication efforts will be required to ensure \nresources are not used to duplicate previous efforts in developing communication materials but enhanced efforts \nunder the ensuing project.  \nB. Consultation and Participation \n1. A stakeholder analysis will be undertaken to identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests, and \ntheir role in determining project feasibility and success. A wide range of stakeholders and beneficiaries will be \nconsulted during project preparation, including Government officials working on ongoing RWSS projects. Other \nstakeholders include government agencies; international and bilateral agencies; nongovernment organizations; mass \norganizations (e.g., the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union); provincial, district, and commune authorities; civil society; private \nwater vendors; and project-affected people and communities. Stakeholders and their roles will be disaggregated by \nsex and ethnic group where possible.  \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations,  etc.)?  During  project  preparation,  a  series  of  stakeholder  consultations  and  TA  workshops \ndisseminated information and sought consensus on project design to aid the preparation of required TA reports. \nParticipatory planning and appraisal techniques will be used to understand community priorities and perceptions \nregarding RWSS. Informant interviews and focused group discussions will be held with men and women from \ndifferent ethnic groups, jointly and individually. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?     Yes       No.  A C&P strategy for the ensuing project will be prepared based \non (i) an expanded stakeholder analysis undertaken during project preparation and (ii) records of consultations noted \nin the poverty and social analysis. The C&P strategy will reflect different participation strategies outlined in social \nsafeguard plans and detailed project-implementation arrangements. \nC. Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nVietnamese women play important roles in agriculture and other economic activities and are responsible for a variety \nof tasks related to water, sanitation, and hygiene in their families and communities. Unsafe water (i.e., high in iron or \ncalcium or contaminated with wastewater) adversely impacts the health of individuals and families (e.g., water-\nrelated diseases and reproductive health problems). RWSS improvements help reduce women\u2019s household burdens \nand improve their access to markets, extension and social services, and information. RWSS improvements in \nschools (e.g., separate toilet facilities for girls and boys) will encourage more girls to stay in school, especially after \ncompleting primary education.  \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nby improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?    \n  Yes     No.  A gender action strategy will be prepared for the overall sector project based on a gender analysis. \nThe Joint-donor Country Gender Assessment for Vietnam (2006)b and the Law on Gender Equality (2006) will inform \nthe analysis. The strategy will include specific gender actions that will make the sector project more responsive to \nwomen\u2019s water supply and sanitation needs. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?   \n  Yes     No.  The gender analysis (part of the PSA) will include men and women\u2019s different water use and \nhygiene needs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n \nIII.
