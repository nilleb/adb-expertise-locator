", " \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During Inception mission of the loan, Decentralized Basic Education Program (DBEP),1 \nin February 2002, the Government of Indonesia requested from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) technical assistance (TA) for strengthening poverty and equity concerns in the DBEP. \nThe broad goals of the DBEP, being a core poverty intervention, are to contribute to (i) poverty \nreduction  by  addressing  inequity  in  human  development  through  improved  access  to  and \ncompletion of 9 years of basic education for poverty-affected children, and (ii) implementation of \nregional autonomy by supporting decentralized management of basic education. The DBEP is \naimed at directly reducing disparities between regions and between income groups. To this end, \nthe  DBEP  is  intended  to  predominantly  allocate  resources  to  poorer  districts  and  schools \ncatering  for  poor  households.  A  critical  activity  during  the  implementation  of  the  DBEP, \ntherefore, is targeting of poor communities and poor children. Technical support for poverty \ntargeting is not included in the existing capacity building packages of the DBEP.  \n \n2.  The TA2 Fact-Finding Mission (the Mission)3 visited Indonesia from 10 to 19 June 2002 \nand  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  objective,  scope,  cost \nestimates,  implementation  arrangements,  schedule,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting services. The preliminary project framework is attached as Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  While Indonesia has achieved significant progress in providing education services, some \nregions and communities remain underserved. Enrollment and completion rates are strongly \ncorrelated with household income levels and gender. Children in difficult situations such as child \nlaborers/workers, students with disabilities, displaced children, or street children are at great risk \nof educational disadvantage. In some locations, girls\u2019 access to education lags behind that of \nboys. Reaching out to underserved areas and children is important for the country, to ensure \nsustained  progress  towards  universal  basic  education  and  balanced  human,  social,  and \neconomic development.  \n   \n4.  Decentralization of education planning, management, and service delivery offers an \nopportunity to devise specific national, regional, and local pro-poor strategies to address the \nexisting inequity. However, some critical issues need to be addressed for pro-poor and poverty \ntargeting strategies to be effective. The lack of reliable education data, both at subdistrict and \ndistrict levels, affects the assessment of progress and the development of effective strategies \naimed at increasing access to education for very poor and vulnerable children, particularly girls. \nThe National Statistical Agency (BPS) provides data on poverty and correlates of poverty on an \nannual basis that is representative to the district level through its National Socio-Economic \nSurvey (SUSENAS). The SUSENAS is useful for analyzing trends and for geographic targeting, \nhowever, it cannot be used to target individual households. Below, the district level, information \nabout households and their level of prosperity (a complimentary concept to poverty) is provided \nby the National Family Planning Coordinating Agency (Badan Koordinasi Keluarga Berencana \nNasional, BKKBN).4 In the absence of other information, this listing is sometimes used in \nconjunction with other verification mechanisms for targeting the poor. However, there remain \nserious  concerns  regarding  reliability  in  collection,  comparability  across  regions,  and \nappropriateness for targeting. Although some sex-disaggregated data are generated by various \ngovernmental institutions, data tends not to be systemically collected, processed, or effectively \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2001.

", "2 \nused for the analysis of policy inputs and planning. There is also a critical shortage of gender \nand social equity research at provincial and district levels. \n \n5.  Within  the  context  and  policies  of  decentralizing  education  management,  the \nGovernment aims to reach out to and encourages greater participation of communities in the \noverall development of education services in Indonesia. The shift from supply-driven and top-\ndown to demand-driven and bottom-up planning and service delivery, will require a different \nmethodology to address issues of education and service delivery for poor children.    \n \n6.  Effective methodologies to target poor and vulnerable children, need to be based on an \nin-depth understanding of poverty. It involves understanding various dimensions of poverty, the \ncauses and dynamics of poverty, and the priorities of the poor themselves. Peoples\u2019 own \nperception of their vulnerability, poverty life pattern, livelihood problems, needs, and solutions \nhave commonly not been integrated with strategies for targeting poor children.    \n \n7.  The  \u201cSustainable  Livelihood  Framework\u201d  constitutes  a  methodology  allowing  an \nunderstanding of poverty, which is people-centered and participatory. The framework focuses \non the economic, institutional, and social dimensions of livelihood sustainability. A poverty study  \nbased on this approach could increase ownership and commitment of involved civil society \ngroups by (i) involving local people in the definition and analysis of poverty, (ii) facilitating local \ncommunities to actively seek ways to reduce their poverty, and (iii) involving local communities \nin poverty targeting.   \n \n8.  Within  the  broader  program  to  support  decentralized  education  management,  the \nSustainable Livelihood Framework approach could be used in a variety of ways: (i) defining \nactivities geared to improve equitable access to education of district education development \nprograms; (ii) establishing a reliable and relevant set of indicators and proxies to be used in \nplanning resource allocations to schools and communities for improving their education service \n(e.g., allocation of formula-based school operations budgets that fully takes into account the \npoverty factors); and (iii) as an input into national strategies to provide subsidies or other types \nof support for improving equity.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  increase  poor  and  vulnerable  children\u2019s  access  to  basic \neducation. The objectives are to (i) develop targeting mechanisms designed to increase poor \nand vulnerable groups\u2019 access to education; (ii) increase awareness, commitment, and capacity \nof the Ministry of National Education (MONE), local governments, and civil society to deliver \nbasic education services to poor and vulnerable children; and (iii) introduce education programs \nbased on equity in the DBEP districts.    \n \n10.  The TA will focus on the 16 districts where the DBEP is being implemented. The TA will \n(i) prepare poverty mapping for these districts, (ii) conduct participatory poverty studies in \nselected villages,5 (iii) prepare guidelines for poverty mapping and poverty studies focusing on \neducation, (iv) review the school selection process of the DBEP in areas where participatory \npoverty studies are not conducted, (v) develop action plans for targeting poor children in all \nDBEP districts, (vi) conduct workshops at district and provincial levels to disseminate poverty \nstudy findings, and (vii) identify the best practices to address poverty in district education and \n                                                 \n5  The studies will cover approximately three villages in each district. The participatory poverty studies include \nhousehold surveys and studies focusing on perception and expectations of poverty-affected communities on \neducation services through participatory approaches and research applying the Sustainable Livelihood Framework. ", "    3 \nschool development plans. The experience and findings will form the basis for developing \nnational  guidelines  on  integration  of  poverty  considerations  in  education  and  school \ndevelopment  planning.6  These  national  guidelines  will  include  a  methodology  for  poverty \nmapping in education; guidance on participatory processes, which will facilitate the planning of \npoverty interventions; and identification of workable indicators and proxies for targeting poor \ncommunities and children.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented in 9 districts in Bali and 7 districts in Nusa Tenggara Barat \ncovered by the DBEP.     \n \n12.  Part A: Poverty Mapping. Poverty mapping will be conducted in each district. The \npurpose of the mapping is to obtain a general overview of the poverty situation in the selected \ndistricts. Existing administrative maps will be used to depict the distribution of poverty perceived \nby key informants and specialists, such as local researchers. This process will rank the villages \nin terms of poverty indicators such as access to water, household incomes, number of out-of- \nschool children, illiteracy rate, number of specific vulnerable households such as female-headed \nhouseholds, or households of indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities.  \n \n13.  Part B: Participatory Poverty Studies. The purpose of the participatory poverty studies \nis to support the school selection process and strengthen allocation of schools funds in terms of \ntargeting the poor. The participatory poverty studies include the following elements: (i) reviewing \npoverty data at subdistrict, village, and school levels, and identifying poverty indicators and \nproxies  currently  available  at  the  subdistrict  and  village  levels;  (ii)  conducting  household \nsurveys;  and  (iii)  conducting  qualitative  studies  focusing  on  identifying  constraints  and \nopportunities for poor and vulnerable children to have access to education. Poverty studies will \nbe conducted in 3\u20134 villages/communities in each district selected. Villages/communities will be \nselected  with  different  socioeconomic  characteristics,  including  middle-income  areas  with \npoverty pockets and low-income areas.    \n \n14.  The participatory poverty studies will be based on the sustainable livelihood framework. \nThe framework highlights the range of assets upon which poor peoples\u2019 livelihoods depend by  \nfocusing on the poor's own definition of definition of well-being, vulnerabilities and opportunities, \nas well as expectations and perceptions of education, livelihood assets in the village, constraints \non poor and vulnerable children\u2019s access to education, gender issues, drop-out rates, and the \nrelationship between schools and their communities. The poverty mapping and participatory \npoverty studies will be analyzed together with existing quantitative data to develop workable \nindicators and proxies for targeting poor communities and children. The poverty studies will also \ndefine equity activities to be included in the district education and school development plans. \nBased  on  the  poverty  mapping  and  participatory  poverty  studies,  operating  guidelines  for \npoverty mapping will be prepared to improve the poverty focus in the planning of new education \nprojects. The participatory approach developed by the poverty studies will be incorporated as an \noperating guideline that can be applied by MONE in planning of poverty targeted interventions in \neducation.     \n \n15.  The poverty studies and mapping will be carried out by a research team consisting of \nfour fieldworkers. The field workers will be recruited from local Indonesian research institutions, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations, and universities. The \nfield workers will work under the supervision of two consultants in each identified village or \ncommunity. The field workers will be trained in participatory poverty methodologies. Project staff \n                                                 \n6  The guidelines may also be of use for other ADB projects. ", "4 \nof  the  DBEP,  NGOs,  school  committees,  school-based  management  field  facilitators,7  and \neducation committees will be included in the training. In addition, government staff of the district \nwill be involved in designing the participatory poverty studies, to build their capacity for pro-poor \neducation planning.      \n \n16.  Part C: Strengthening Capacity for Poverty Targeting in School Development and \nEducation Development Planning. Workshops will be conducted at district and provincial \nlevels to disseminate findings of the poverty studies. School committees, education boards, \nlocal government officials, researchers, and civil society will be invited to participate in the \nworkshops. The workshops will focus on identifying equity-based activities to be included in the \ndistrict education and school development plans, development of action plans for implementing \nthese activities, and identification of mechanisms to institutionalize poverty analysis as part of \nschool development and education development plans. Specific training courses will be offered \nto district education planners to facilitate an institutionalization of poverty mapping and poverty \ntargeting strategies within decentralized education management systems.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, comprising $270,000 in \nforeign exchange and $480,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Government requested \nfinancing for $600,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $330,000 \nequivalent  of  local  currency  cost.    The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis,  with  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom providing $300,000 equivalent and ADB providing $300,000 \nequivalent financed by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining \nlocal  currency  costs  amounting  to  $150,000  equivalent  to  cover  office  accommodation, \ncounterpart and support staff, workshop facilities, and related items. Detailed cost estimates and \nthe financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. ADB will administer the grant provided by DFID.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  MONE will be the Executing Agency. The Central Facilitation Unit (CFU) established \nunder the DBEP will be responsible for coordinating and administering the TA, together with \nstaff from MONE. The steering committee and the Central Technical Committee established \nunder the DBEP will review the TA\u2019s progress, facilitate coordination between the agencies and \ndepartments involved in implementation, and provide technical guidance. The CFU will be \nresponsible for overall planning, coordination, implementation, and administration of the TA. The \nCFU  will  oversee  TA  activities;  facilitate  coordination  with  the  local  government,  linkage \nbetween the DBEP, a complementing Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) project,8 and \nother  projects  supporting  decentralization  of  basic  education.  A  team  comprising  one \ninternational and one domestic consultant will work within the existing DBEP management \nstructure. The team will supervise and provide technical advice, prepare progress reports for \nsubmission to ADB, and function as the contact point for ADB.  At the district level, the district \ncoordination committee and district project management and monitoring unit will be responsible \nfor the day-to-day coordination between the DBEP and the TA.   \n \n19.  ADB will, in consultation with MONE, engage individual consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will have expertise in qualitative and \nquantitative poverty analysis based on participatory approaches, education, and planning. The \nTA will require 8 person-months of international and 15 person-months of domestic consulting \n                                                 \n7  School-based management field facilitators are being recruited under the DBEP.

Twelve field workers will also be recruited for 48 person-months, using arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The two consultants will be \nresponsible for recruiting the field workers. An outline of the terms of reference is provided in \nAppendix  3.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement.   \n \n20.  The TA will be monitored and reviewed by ADB missions, by regular communications \nwith MONE, and through the reports of the consultants.  \n \n21.  MONE will nominate and ADB will approve participants of training activities under the \nTA.  The consultants will be the trainers for these training activities. MONE will select from its \nstaff those who will be in charge of implementing poverty studies after the completion of the TA. \n  \n22.  The TA will be implemented during 15 months, with activities expected to commence in \nJanuary 2003 and completed in April 2004. The consultants will submit (i) an inception report at \nthe end of the first month, (ii) progress reports every 3 months; (iii) draft poverty maps at the \nend of the twelfth month, (iv) a draft synthesis report of participatory poverty studies at the end \nof the sixteenth month, (v) draft guidelines on poverty mapping and poverty studies at the end of \nthe sixteenth month, and (vi) a final report within 3 months of the completion of the TA. Tripartite \nreviews will be held to review each of the outputs. Corresponding to these reviews, stakeholder \nconsultation  workshops  will  be  held  to  present  progress  to  and  obtain  input  from  MONE, \nregional governments, civil society, and representatives of the communities involved.   \n \nII.
