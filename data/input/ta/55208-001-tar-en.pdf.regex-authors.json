Justification \n \n1.  Investment in high quality private infrastructure sector projects in Central, West and South \nAsia requires extensive project preparatory market research and study, followed by identification, \nearly-stage  screening,  origination,  preparation,  and  processing  of  commercially  viable \nnonsovereign transactions for potential ADB private sector participation. An important part of such \nactivities also entails identification of potential integrity, reputational, and money laundering risks \nand designing appropriate mitigation measures. The proposed transaction technical assistance \n(TA) is designed to undertake this particular activity of due diligence. The TA will complement \nADB\u2019s own efforts, research and transaction support and portfolio management activities with \nrespect to integrity due diligence (IDD) issues. \n \n2.  Reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific requires strong private sector engagement to \naddress key development and infrastructure gaps, stable trade opportunities, and creation of \ngainful employment. As per recent studies, South Asia and Central/West Asia (the subject matter \nof this proposed TA) needs to invest an average of $400 billion annually in infrastructure until \n2030 to maintain its growth momentum and tackle poverty,1 excluding the cost of responding to \nclimate change (in which case the amount is pegged at $460 billion). Private sector investment in \ninfrastructure and enhancing efficiency of infrastructure services is crucial to meet this need. \nWhile there has already been a robust growth in the region in recent years with substantial private \nsector engagement, the ADB is committed to significantly increase its private sector support \nthrough providing financing and support to commercially viable private sector projects. \n \n3.  Corruption, fraud, and money laundering harm economic development and hinder efforts \nto reduce poverty\u2014and have emerged as one of the key development challenges in the Asia and \nPacific.  To address this, ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy requires ADB projects and staff to adhere \nto the highest standards in these regards.2 The primary objective of this TA is to help address this \nkey development gap by preparing a pipeline of private sector projects in developing member \ncountries of Central, West, and South Asian region that would meet ADB\u2019s stringent requirements \nlaid out in its policies, procedures and guidelines relating to IDD.3 \n \n4.  The TA responds directly to ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030\u2014which calls for expanding private \nsector operations by providing financing and promoting high standards of corporate governance, \nintegrity, transparency, and social and environmental safeguards.4 The TA is also consistent with \nADB\u2019s operational plan for private sector operations, 2019\u20132024, which requires ADB to promote \nthe highest level of integrity in its operations, be disciplined and selective, and ensure that lending \nand investment decisions are based on a thorough understanding of the risks and that risks and \nrewards are balanced appropriately.5 \n \n \n \n \n \n1  ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) private sector investment in infrastructure \nin Central, West and South Asia region enhanced, (ii) development impact as the key objective \nof private sector pursued, and (iii) private sector projects meeting best-practice integrity standards \nprepared. The TA will have the following outcome: ADB\u2019s private sector infrastructure investment, \ncomplying with its integrity standards, increased in Central, West and South Asia. \n \n6.  Output 1: Private sector projects in infrastructure sector identified and screened, \nand IDD undertaken. The TA will support all required IDD and know-your-customer (KYC) \nchecks of private infrastructure sector projects in Central, West and South Asia (including those \nprocessed under One-ADB approach). It will encompass the entire project processing cycle. The \nTA will help identify and screen infrastructure sector projects - that would meet ADB\u2019s integrity \nrequirements  -  during  the  period  2021\u20132023.  The  IDD  process  generally  comprises:  the \nidentification and investigations (as needed) of ultimate beneficial owners, shareholders, senior \nexecutives, affiliates, subsidiaries, significant contracting entities, and other key counterparties as \nrequired under ADB\u2019s relevant procedures and guidelines on IDD (footnote 3). Based on the \nabove assessments, significant or potentially significant integrity risks will be identified and \nevaluated in coordination with the Private Sector Transaction Support division of PSOD, the Office \nof Anticorruption and Integrity, and the Office of General Counsel. It is expected that the number \nof project leads initially screened will amount to at least 20 per annum. \n \n7.  Output  2:  Capacity  development  of  private  sector  companies  to  meet  ADB\u2019s \nintegrity requirements for private sector investment. This output will enhance potential \nborrowers\u2019/sponsors\u2019 project preparatory efforts through improved awareness of ADB\u2019s strategic \npriorities and requirements on the IDD front, and close cooperation at an early stage. The TA will \nsupport the readiness of a project from an integrity perspective by engaging consultants who will \nprovide specialized knowledge and expertise in the area of integrity due diligence to help private \nsector sponsors to meet requirements under ADB\u2019s relevant procedures and guidelines on IDD \n(footnote 3). The consultants will advise and provide guidance to the borrowers/sponsors on the \nIDD process and on the relevance and adequacy of the KYC documents and information provided. \nNumber of projects made ready for ADB financing is expected to be at least 10\u201315 by July 2023. \n \n8.  Output 3: Solutions identified to mitigate IDD related risks in ADB\u2019s private sector \nprojects. This output will focus on resolving and mitigating integrity risks, if any, as the key \ncomponent of ADB\u2019s project cycle processing. Consultants will advise project team leads on \npotential mitigants and such recommendations may result in structural changes, that will enable \nthe successful closure of infrastructure sector nonsovereign projects. It is expected that integrity \nrisks and proposed mitigants will be documented in the IDD Checklists of at least 10 projects, and \nsuch projects will be assessed by the Office of Anticorruption and Integrity. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $372,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  ($221,400,  TASF-donor  contribution,  $150,600,  TASF-\nincome transfer).  The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n ", "3 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.
