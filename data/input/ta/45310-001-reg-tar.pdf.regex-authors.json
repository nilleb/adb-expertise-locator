INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  There is increased recognition that sharing development knowledge and expertise can \nlead to relevant, effective and efficient solutions to common development challenges, both \nwithin  and  across  regions.  Developing  countries  have  accumulated  effective  development \npractices, and have achieved substantial results in various domains. There remains enormous \npotential and urgency in further exploring and harnessing the opportunities for South\u2013South \ncooperation (SSC).1 Among the current impediments to greater SSC are limited institutional \ncapacity, lack of financial resources and a disconnection between supply and demand. In 2008, \nthe Accra Agenda for Action2 acknowledged the contributions made in support of development, \nand in particular the role of middle-income countries as both providers and recipients of aid as a \nmajor contribution in the pursuit of SSC, and acknowledged that much can be learned from the \nexperience of developing countries. However, it was evident that the development community \nlacked understanding of the dynamics and features of technical cooperation and knowledge \nexchange among developing nations. As a result the task team on South\u2013South Cooperation \n(TT-SSC) was formed in 2009 with the aim of exploring the synergies between SSC and the aid-\neffectiveness agenda.3 \n \n2.  Regional development banks can add value to such cooperation through their unique \nroles and regional perspectives. The proposed regional technical assistance (TA) will be used to \nfacilitate knowledge sharing and learning from best practices between developing countries in \nAsia and the Pacific and Latin America.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Latin America is experiencing strong growth. In particular, regional growth exceeded the \nhistorical average during 2004-2006 and continues at above 4%. Fundamental reforms to Latin \nAmerican financial markets5 have resulted in most countries achieving macroeconomic stability. \nInflation has trended down for more than a decade, and poverty and unemployment indicators \nhave shown remarkable improvement in some countries.6 In addition, Latin American countries \n(LACs) have been deepening their regional integration since the 1970s, and have achieved very \npositive  results  in:  i)  the  creation  of  common  markets;  ii)  fostering  trade  and  promoting \neconomic transformation (particularly in the labor and financial markets, and in social security \n                                                \n1 SSC can be developed through: (i) practitioner and/or peer networks and communities of practice, (ii) field visits and \nstudy tours, (iii) summits and conferences, and (iv) structured learning platforms (courses and workshops). \n2 To accelerate implementation of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the Accra Agenda for Action was \nendorsed in 2008 by the international community during the Third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in \nAccra, Ghana. Available:  \n http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,3746,en_2649_3236398_35401554_1_1_1_1,00.html \n3 It is important to explore these issues in the context of growing economic linkages among developing countries and \nconsider how SSC can ensure these linkages complement efforts to build productive capability in countries with \ndiffering initial endowments, institutional histories and policy capacities. \n4 The TA will be implemented within the framework of the memoranda of understanding (MOUs) signed between ADB \nand the Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF) on 20 January 2011, and between ADB and the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank (IADB) in November 2009. In addition to signing the MOU, ADB and CAF also signed a \ncooperation agreement in May 2011, under which both ADB and CAF propose to contribute a sum of $500,000 to \ncarry out joint activities under the 2011 MOU. IADB is expected to approve $1,000,000 by the end of 2011 to \nimplement joint activities with ADB under the 2009 MOU. Pursuant to the MOUs with ADB, CAF and IADB will also \ncollaborate and sponsor activities in the field of SSC. CAF and IADB will process, approve, finance and implement \nthese activities in accordance with their own internal policies and procedures. \n5 Encompassing changes in the legal and regulatory frameworks, ownership patterns and market infrastructure. \n6 These reforms have been accompanied by national and regional investments in modern physical and institutional \ninfrastructure. \n ", "2   \nand  pensions);7 iii)  macroeconomic  and  monetary  coordination,  particularly  in  the  Andean \ncountries;  and  iv)  the  creation  of  regional  institutions  with  specific  mandates,  including \nsettlement of regional disputes. Moreover, regional integration has fostered regional cooperation \nin:  i)  infrastructure  development  to  strengthen  intraregional  connectivity;  ii)  geopolitical \ncoordination, with democratic clauses to fence threats against democratic regimes and conflict \nresolution mechanisms to address border issues; and iii) strengthening of institutional capacity \nthrough North\u2013South cooperation and SSC and TA.  \n \n4.  In the past decade, most LACs, and particularly Chile, Brazil and Mexico, invested in \npragmatic socially inclusive poverty reduction strategies that reduced the income gap between \nthe richer and the poorer segments of society. Poverty reduction resulted in part from general \neconomic growth, but these countries also tackled inequalities through targeted and innovative \nsocial protection interventions. Chile and Mexico financed these initiatives through effective \nmanagement  of  natural  resource  revenues,  while  Brazil  achieved  remarkable  results  by \ndeveloping policies to: i) decrease wage differentials related to educational level, and reduce \ninequality in access to education; and ii) increase spatial and sectoral integration of labor \nmarkets between urban and non-urban areas, resulting in relative increases in wages and living \nstandards  in  small  and  medium-sized  urban  areas.  These  policies  were  accompanied  by \ntargeted  schemes  of  innovative  government  conditional  transfers  to  the  most  vulnerable \nsegments of the population, and public\u2013private partnerships. Brazil has also become one of the \nbiggest producers of biofuel, allowing the government to reduce oil imports and free financial \nresources for socially\u2013inclusive initiatives and infrastructure development. Finally, many LACs \nsucceeded in developing a healthy private sector based primarily on small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs).8  \n \n5.  Countries in the Asia and Pacific region could benefit from a knowledge exchange with \nLatin America, and in particular from the experience of LACs in inclusive growth, intraregional \ninfrastructure  development,  regional  integration  initiatives,  macroeconomic  and  monetary \nreforms, pensions, public financial management,9 public\u2013private partnerships and support to \nSMEs. While Latin America has been innovating in public national and interregional policies for \nsocial protection, PPPs, infrastructure, regional integration, public financial management, and \nbiofuel, Asian countries have specialized in the production of highly technological goods.10  \n \n6.  The challenge for developing countries is how to use trade, investment and technology \nflows to support strong productivity growth, and increased productive employment and real \nwages without generating external imbalances and distortions that could slow their economic \ntransition. This challenge has been successfully addressed in different parts of the developing \nworld during since the early 1990s; it has been managed in the context of strong regional \nlinkages, particularly in East Asia, but other regions have struggled to replicate this experience. \n                                                \n7 In the People Republic of China, the government is beginning to be concerned with the issues associated with an \nageing population, and which afflict many developed countries (The Economist. 2011. Raising power, anxious \nstate. 25 June). Pensions will soon become a problem to solve. LACs have gained some relevant experience on \nthis issue since the early 1980s. \n8  Driven by the market interconnectivity provided by regional integration, these SMEs overcame the constraints that \nsmall firms generally face when competing with larger ones. \n9  Particularly of natural resources and commodity goods-generated revenue \n10 This specialization has triggered increasing investment by both governments and private sector entities in research \ncenters, institutes and universities, which have become centers of excellence in specific sectors and areas of \nexpertise. Moreover, many Asian countries managed to successfully transition from import-substitution economic \npolicies to an export orientation. By doing so, a few have become middle-income economies, and may be able to \nescape the \u201cmiddle-income trap\u201d that hindered the LACs; however, many Asian countries remain at risk of running \ninto this trap. \n ", "  3 \nThe emergence of strong, growing economies among developing nations has revived interest in \ntrade- and finance-related regional arrangements and mechanisms, but to date the implications \nand opportunities for the productive economy have been less thoroughly explored. Finally, in the \npast years, trade between countries in the Asia and Pacific region and Latin America has \nincreased, with Asia accounting for over 20% of Latin America\u2019s foreign trade. Initiatives to \nsupport trade facilitation between the two regions are also possible activities to be financed \nunder the TA. \n \n7.  Countries in Latin America and the Asia and Pacific region are increasingly expressing \nthe  need  to  engage  with  policy  makers  and  technical  experts  to  learn  from  each  other\u2019s \nexperience  in  developing  different  solutions  to  their  common  challenges.  An  institutional \nplatform to provide current and past policymakers in Asia and Latin America with a forum to \ninteract on economic policy challenges would be mutually beneficial (and self sustaining, once \nthe benefits became apparent). In this context, multilateral organizations can play a fundamental \nrole in facilitating knowledge exchange among partner countries. Moreover, the institutions can \nalso learn from each other\u2019s experiences and strengths and thereby increase their capacity to \nachieve  the  goals  in  their  respective  strategic  frameworks.  Finally,  joint  studies  support \ndevelopment of innovative solutions to common issues. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  TA  will  aim  to  increase  the  effectiveness,  sustainability,  and  quality  of  policy \ndevelopment through knowledge sharing, policy dialogue and coordination between the Asia \nand Pacific region and Latin America.11 The TA will serve as a modality and mechanism for \nADB  and  its  partners  to  respond  to  requests  from  developing  member  countries  (DMCs) \nregarding thematic areas common in the two regions. Ultimately, it is expected that the TA will \ncontribute (through the implementation of the MOUs with CAF and IADB)12 to poverty reduction \nand sustainable development in Asia and Latin America.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will be an innovative tool to provide ADB DMCs with access to knowledge in the \nareas and/or sectors where LACs have been excelling. The spectrum of topics that the TA might \ncover is broad. The TA is intended as a pilot in knowledge-sharing and SSC activities between \nthe Asia and Pacific region and Latin America; as such, it is envisaged to be as inclusive as \npossible. Funding will support activities that provide DMCs with access to valuable information, \ninnovative approaches and technical skills available in LACs. Activities under the TA will be \ncarried out in accordance with the institutional agreements between ADB, CAF, and IADB, and \nwill  include:  (i)  the  organization  of  interregional  fora,  workshops,  and  seminars  with  the \nparticipation of DMC officials and technical experts; (ii) the exchange of best practices and \nsuccessful experiences among the parties and/or the DMCs;13 (iii) the organization of study \ntours  and  learning  exchange  visits  between  DMC  officials  and  technical  experts;  (iv)  staff \n                                                \n11 Investments in structured exchange models that overcome the drawbacks inherent to isolated initiatives are a key \nsuccess factor in SSC. The aim of the TA is to support the exchange of knowledge between Asia and Latin \nAmerica to enable both regions to benefit from the other\u2019s development experiences. \n12 ADB and IADB discussed the opportunity to consider the project as a pilot, which could be scaled up if successful. \n13 PSOD participated in a microfinance conference organized by CAF in Panama and presented experience from \nAsia and the Pacific. \n ", "4   \nexchange programs between local institutions; and (v) the preparation of joint studies on topics \nof common interest,14 and preparation of policy lesson papers for dissemination.  \n \n10.  The following areas of collaboration are among those that have been identified by ADB, \nCAF  and  IADB:15 (i)  Promote  exchange  of  best  practices  in  of  infrastructure  (sustainable \nenergy,  information  and  technology,  and  transport);  social  development  (water,  urban \ndevelopment, education, conditional cash transfers, governance, and civil society); environment \n(clean energy and disaster risk management); and financial policies and finance (particularly for \nSMEs); (ii) collaborate in capacity-building initiatives, policy research, networking activities and \ninterregional fora to promote knowledge management, trade and investment between Latin \nAmerica and Asia and the Pacific, particularly in areas related to infrastructure; trade facilitation; \nsocial  development  (water,  urban  development,  education,  conditional  cash  transfers,  and \ngovernance); the environment; and finance (SMEs); and (iii) enhance policy and private sector \ndialogue,  cooperation  through  communities  of  practice  and  SSC  between  the  regions  to \npromote interregional economic and cooperation linkages. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The TA will cover: (i) workshops; \n(ii) the publication and dissemination of results; (iii) support to officials from DMCs to attend the \nworkshops and seminars envisaged by the agreements; (iv) support to officials from DMCs to \nundertake study tours to Latin America, as a learning experience; and (v) the engagement of \ninternational  consultants  to  carry  out the  evaluation  of the  partnerships. The  detailed  cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 49 months (December 2011\u2013December 2015). ADB, \nthrough the Strategy, Policy, and Interagency Relations Division (SPPI), will be the executing \nagency of the TA. Throughout the TA period, SPPI will consult with and be guided by other \ndivisions of ADB\u2014the Regional Sustainable Development Department, the Office of Regional \nEconomic  Integration,  Treasury,  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department,  the  Office  of \nCofinancing, and various regional departments\u2014which will be the implementing agencies. The \nAsian Development Bank Institute has also been actively involved. At the request of the DMCs \nand/or the implementing agencies, consultants will be engaged to carry out joint studies and \nworkshops with IADB or CAF on topics relevant to inclusive growth in DMCs. To ensure proper \nand efficient allocation of resources, the SPPI director will screen and approve all proposals for \njoint studies, study tours, staff exchange programs, resource persons, and workshops. The \nproposals will need to specify the rationale of the proposal, the implementation arrangements \nagreed with IADB or CAF, and the terms of reference for the consultants. ADB will recruit and \nengage consultants for the joint studies and workshops in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Any related procurement16 will be \n                                                \n14 IADB and the Asian Development Bank Institute have started preliminary work on a joint report on the relations \nbetween Latin America and the Asia and Pacific region that should be presented and disseminated in early 2012.  \n15 A workplan will be prepared and agreed upon bilaterally with both CAF and IADB, on annual basis. This exercise \nwill allow planning joint activities and revision of areas of common interest. A list of activities to be planned in 2012 \nis presently under preparation. \n16 The procurement of material for workshops, conferences and seminars to be held in Asia and the Pacific will be \nlimited to office supplies, seminar material, printers, etc. provided by suppliers from ADB member countries. For \nsimilar activities held in Latin America, IADB and CAF will be in charge of procurement of necessary materials. \n ", "  5 \nconducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).    \n \n13.  The TA will be monitored in parallel with the implementation of the MOUs between ADB \nand CAF, and ADB and IADB. The designated focal points of ADB, CAF, and IADB will prepare \na joint report after 2.5 years on the status of implementation of the joint cooperation activities. \nThe reporting format will be agreed upon by ADB, CAF, and IADB and will, to the extent \npossible,  be  based  on  existing  reports  produced  by  the  three  institutions.  In  respect  of \nevaluation of their joint activities, ADB, CAF, and IADB share a commitment to strengthen, \nmonitor and evaluate their development assistance efforts and their engagement with other \ndonors and development partners; and, as part of their consultations, the parties will monitor \nand  assess  their  respective  performance  in  implementing  their  commitments  under  their \nagreements.  Details  of  evaluation  of  the  partnership  are  available  in  Appendix  3.  A \ncommunication plan between ADB, IADB, and CAF will be developed in order to effectively \ndisseminate the policy recommendations and lessons from the evaluation, studies, reports and \nworkshops. \n \n14.  The activities to be financed under the TA will include missions to Latin America by \nconsultants and officials from ADB member countries, to undertake study tours, participate in \nworkshops or staff exchange programs. The TA will also finance the expenses of resource \npersons  for  seminars  and  workshops,  who  are  nationals  from  Latin  America  and  the \nCaribbean.17 These activities will require a waiver from ADB\u2019s Board of Directors of the ADB \nmember  country  procurement  eligibility  restrictions  laid  down  in  Article  3.04(a)  (iii)  of  the \nRegulations of the Technical Assistance Special Fund, and in ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and Procurement Guidelines. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n \n15.  The President recommends that the Board approve a waiver of procurement eligibility \nrestrictions, such that (i) travel and associated travel expenses, including per diem, incurred by \nconsultants and officials from ADB member countries in non-ADB member countries, and (ii) \ntravel  and  associated  travel  expenses,  including  per  diem  and  remuneration,  of  resource \npersons from Latin America and the Caribbean, be eligible for financing under the proposed \ntechnical assistance for Enhancing Knowledge Sharing and South\u2013South Cooperation between \nAsia and Latin America. \n \n16.  If the Board approves the proposal in paragraph 15, the President, acting under the \nauthority  delegated  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  provision  of  technical  assistance  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis for Enhancing Knowledge Sharing and \nSouth\u2013South Cooperation between Asia and Latin America. \n \n                                                \n17 Resource persons will include nationals from ADB member countries or nationals from the following non\u2013member \ncountries: Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, \nEcuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, \nPeru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Joint Evaluation of the Partnerships: ADB\u2013Corporacion Andina de Fomento and \nADB\u2013Inter-American Development Bank (3 person\u2013months) \n \n1.  Purpose \n2.  The  mid\u2013term  evaluation,  undertaken  in  2013,  will  assess  the  performance  of  the \npartnerships between ADB and Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF), and ADB and the Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank (IADB). The findings and recommendations of the evaluation \nshould  provide  guidance  to  the  institutions  in  further  strengthening  their  partnerships  for \nenhanced achievement of development results. \n \n2.  Objectives  and  Scope  of  the  Proposed  Joint  Evaluation  of  the \nMemorandums of Cooperation \n3.  Each evaluation will examine: \n(i)  the relevance of the objectives of the partnership, \n(ii)   the effectiveness and efficiency of the institutional arrangements; and \n(iii)  lessons that could improve implementation of these and similar partnerships.  \n \n3.  Evaluation Framework \n4.  The consultant will assess the following key aspects of each partnership:  \n(i)   Relevance:  how  the  partnership  contributes  to  the  achievement  of  poverty \nreduction and inclusive growth in Asia and the Pacific and Latin America, and \nhow relevant the experiences of each region are to the developmental issues \nfacing the other region. \n(ii)   Efficiency:  how  the  partnerships  ensure  that  the  resources  of  the  three \norganizations are used more efficiently in support of closer cooperation and in \nreaching their respective strategic targets. \n(iii)   Effectiveness:  to  what  extent  each  partnership  has  added  value  to  the \noperations  of the  organizations:  (a)  whether the  partnership facilitated  policy \ndialogue between the organizations and their respective regional development \npartners, (b) the extent to which joint activities have built on the comparative \nadvantages  of  the  organizations  and  their  respective  developing  member \ncountries,  and  (c)  how  implementation  of  the  partnerships  has  encouraged \nlearning and knowledge sharing across the key sectors of cooperation. \n(iii)  Sustainability: if (a) the arrangements set up in the partnership agreements are \nsustainable;  (b)  whether  resources  have  been  allocated  to  promoting  and \nmaintaining the partnerships; and (c) which areas have been promoted, and \nwhich may need additional attention. \n \n4.
