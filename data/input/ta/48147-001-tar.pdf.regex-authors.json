The Strategic Framework for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nProgram 2011\u20132020,1 identifies energy as an operation priority with the vision of achieving (i) \nenergy  security  through  balanced  development  of  the  region\u2019s  energy  infrastructure  and \ninstitutions; (ii) stronger integration of the region\u2019s energy markets to make available adequate \nvolumes  of  commercial  energy  in  a  reliable,  affordable,  financially  sustainable,  and \nenvironmentally sound manner; and (iii) economic growth through energy trade.  In 2012, the \nCAREC Energy Work Plan (EWP), 2013\u20132015 was adopted to ensure effective and timely \nachievement of the strategic objectives laid out in the CAREC Strategy 2020. 2  \n \n2.  The Study for a Power Sector Financing Road Map within CAREC, to be prepared under \nthis technical assistance (TA), will assess the capacity and willingness of CAREC countries3 to \nfinance power infrastructure development from their own resources, and examine other potential \nsources of financing for both national and cross-border projects.4 Any legal and regulatory \nframework in the region that may impede cross-border projects will be reviewed. In particular, \nthe TA will identify power projects with public\u2013private partnership (PPP) potential, and will \nhighlight measures for stimulating private interest in the CAREC region\u2019s power sector. The TA \nwill also review the energy strategy in the CAREC Strategy 2020 and assist the implementation \nof capacity building and knowledge management activities under the EWP, 2013\u20132015. The \nconcept paper was approved on 20 March 2014. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  All CAREC countries have substantial investment needs for power sector development, \nas indicated by their national development plans and recent studies. According to the 2012 \nPower  Sector  Regional  Master  Plan  involving  four  CAREC  countries  (Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan)  and  completed  in  October  2012  through  Asian \nDevelopment Bank technical assistance, an investment of about $36 billion is required over a \n10-year period (2013\u20132022) for the rehabilitation and expansion of power infrastructure in these \ncountries alone.5 The 10-year plan includes $32.8 billion of investment in generation and $3.2 \nbillion of investment in the 500-kilovolt and 220-kilovolt transmission systems. The recently \ncompleted Afghanistan Power Sector Master Plan and the National Power System Expansion \nPlan  for  Pakistan  contain  similarly  challenging  investment  projections.  For  example,  the \nAfghanistan plan has established a total investment requirement of $10.1 billion, including $7.3 \nbillion for power generation and $2.8 billion for power transmission in the country.  \n  \n4.  The power sector financing requirements of the CAREC countries will be beyond the \nreach of some of these countries and will stretch the financial resources of others. Given the \nenormity of funds needed and the limited financing for power infrastructure projects coming from \nthe public sector,  there  is an  urgent  need  to explore  other  possible  sources of  financing, \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2012. CAREC 2020: a Strategic Framework for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program \n2011\u20132020.  Manila. \n2  CAREC senior officials approved the EWP at the October 2012 meeting in Wuhan, People\u2019s Republic of China. \n3  The study will cover Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, People\u2019s Republic of China (Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region \nand  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region),  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 April 2014. \n5  ADB.  2010. Technical Assistance for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Power Sector Regional Master \nPlan. Manila. \n ", "2 \nincluding private sector funds. The same sentiment was highlighted in the EWP 2013\u20132015 and \nconvinced the CAREC Energy Sector Coordinating Committee (ESCC) of the necessity of this \nTA.  Given the lack of a financing road map and the capacity to develop it, the TA will assist the \nCAREC  countries  in  developing  a  power  sector  financing  road  map  that  will  pinpoint  the \nrequirements for access to funds, sustainable financing approaches, and modalities for national \nand regional power infrastructure development within CAREC. \n \n5.  The EWP has six actionable elements to implement sector operational priorities:  (i) \ndeveloping the Central Asia\u2012South Asia Energy Corridor,6 (ii) resolving regional energy dispatch \nand trade issues, (iii) managing energy\u2012water linkages, (iv) mobilizing funds to build energy \nassets, (v) implementing energy priority projects, and (vi) building capacity and knowledge \nmanagement. The ESCC guides and oversees implementation of the EWP 2013\u20122015, as well \nas reviews the conclusions and recommendations of diagnostic work and studies to be carried \nout in support of the plan. The committee monitors and reports on the plan's progress on a \nregular basis, shares outputs, and discusses key conclusions and initiatives. ADB, as the lead in \nthe energy sector of CAREC, is responsible for implementing part of element 1 and elements 4, \n5, and 6. The implementation of element 1 led by ADB is supported by the processing and \nimplementation of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (TUTAP) \nInterconnection Initiative, while implementation of element 5 is led by the ESCC secretariat \nthrough consolidation and regular updating of the working list of projects.  \n \n6.  This TA will mainly focus on the implementation of elements 4 and 6. The institutional \ninefficiency and lack of technical skills among CAREC countries need to be improved and \nenhanced as they are vital for the efficient integration of power systems of CAREC countries. \nThe  TA  will  help  bridge  the  capacity  gap  in  CAREC  countries  and  provide  for  the \nimplementation of capacity-building programs. The overall energy strategy embedded in the \nCAREC Strategy 2020 was approved in 2008. It played a critical role in laying the foundation \nand defining the approach for the regional cooperation and effective development of the energy \nsector for CAREC countries. The energy strategy would need to be reviewed to consider current \nand prospective demands, and emerging issues, in the region. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be mobilized funds for CAREC power sector infrastructure development.  \nThe  outcome  will  be  an  implementable  pipeline  of  projects  for  CAREC  countries  with \nsustainable financing modalities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n8.  The TA has three outputs: (i) a CAREC power sector financing road map; (ii) revised \nenergy strategy in the CAREC Strategy 2020; and (iii) implementation of the EWP.  \n \n9.  The CAREC power sector financing road map will provide each CAREC member country \nwith (i) a review of national and regional power sector investment and development plans; (ii) an \nassessment of the power sector, including industry structure, institutional arrangements, and \ncapacity of the government and state-owned power utilities; (iii) a macroeconomic assessment \n                                                 \n6  Certain cross-border projects and programs are being implemented or are actively considered for energy transfer \nfrom Central Asia to South Asia, all transiting Afghanistan. \n ", "3 \nand fiscal profiling to include overall government budget and spending on power infrastructure \nprojects, PPP structure, and borrowing capacity; (iv) an overview of alternative sources of \nfinance for power sector development, including donor assistance, sovereign wealth funds, \nexport  credit  agencies,  and  commercial  and/or  private  sources;  (v)  a  review  of  legal  and \nregulatory frameworks in the region; (vi) an assessment of the enabling environment with a list \nof reforms necessary for promoting private investment in the power sector; and (vii) a catalogue \nof potential PPP power projects. \n \n10.  An individual international consultant will be engaged to: (i) assist in the implementation \nof element 6 capacity building activities under the EWP 2013\u20132015, (ii) the review and revision \nof the energy strategy in the CAREC Strategy 2020, and (iii) provide substantive inputs for the \nmeetings  of  the  ESCC,  senior  CAREC  officials,  and  the  ministerial  conference  between \nDecember 2014 and December 2015. \n \n11.  It is a major assumption that CAREC countries\u2019 commitment to energy sector reforms \nand investments, and an enabling environment for power sector investments are in place. Major \nrisks are (i) lack of political support from parties to implement the road map and regional \nintegration  of  power  markets,  (ii)  weak  coordination  between  interested  donors,  and \n(iii) countries\u2019 conflicting agenda and priorities for energy sector development. To manage these \nrisks, a working group under the auspices of the ESCC, composed of energy officials from \nCAREC countries, will be established to (i) provide direction on the deliverables of the TA (ii) \nensure support and coordination from their respective member countries, and (iii) agree upon \nthe implementable pipeline of projects with identified financing modalities. Regular updates on \nthe developments under the TA will be reported to the ESCC during its biannual meetings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $0.5 million will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and \nPoverty Reduction Fund, and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency, and the Energy Division of its Central and West Asia \nDepartment the focal point. The TA will be implemented over 16 months, from September 2014 \nto December 2015. It will require 45 person-months of inputs from international experts in \nfinance and/or public finance, economics, legal and regulatory, and energy; and 20 person-\nmonths of inputs from national consultants in each CAREC country to provide country-specific \nresearch and assessments, and to assist in the implementation of TA activities in their home \ncountry. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. A working group \ncomprising  energy  officials  from  CAREC  member  countries  will  be  established  to  provide \ndirection to the consultants and endorse the deliverables. \n \n14.  A firm with a team of international experts and national consultants from each CAREC \ncountry will be engaged to conduct the study using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod (with a technical\u2013financial weighting of 80:20). ADB will also engage an individual \ninternational  consultant  according  to  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  TA  will  be  monitored  through  monthly  progress  reports \ncovering all aspects of the study scope. The consulting firm will submit (i) an inception report \n ", "4 \ndetailing the work program and methodology of the study (1 month after engagement), (ii) an \ninterim report summarizing conclusions and recommendations (within 8 months), and (iii) a draft \nfinal report  (within 10 months). The consulting firm will present the draft final report at a meeting \nof the ESCC, ADB, and other development partners. Their comments and suggestions will feed \ninto the final report, to be submitted within 12 months of service start. All disbursements under \nthe TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time).   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 \non a grant basis for the Study for a Power Sector Financing Road Map within Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "  Appendix 1  5          \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nFunds mobilized for  New funds for power  Statistical reports of the  CAREC governments\u2019 \nCAREC power  projects amounting to at  countries\u2019 utilities   commitment to energy \nsector  least $50 billion are  sector reforms and \ninfrastructure  mobilized by 2020 (2013  investments \ndevelopment  baseline: $10 billion)   \n  Risk \n  Lack of political support from \nparties to implement road \nmap and regional integration \nof power markets \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nImplementable  Medium-term and long- CAREC ESCC  Enabling environment for \npipeline of projects  term project list in  progress report  power sector investments is \nfor CAREC  energy sector developed    in place \ncountries identified  and endorsed by  Statistical reports of the   \nwith sustainable  CAREC countries, with  countries\u2019 utilities  Risk \nfinancing modalities   proposed financing  Weak coordination between \nmodalities, by 2015   interested donors  \n \nOutputs       Risk \nCAREC power  CAREC ESCC endorsed  CAREC ESCC  Countries\u2019 conflicting agenda \nsector financing  the road map by  progress report  and priorities on energy \nroad map  December 2015   sector development \ndeveloped      \n   \nEnergy strategy in  CAREC ESCC endorsed \nthe CAREC  the energy strategy by \nStrategy 2020  September 2015 \nreviewed and   \nrevised   \n   \n   \nEnergy work plan  At least two training \n2013\u20132015  programs or study tours \nimplemented  completed and 100 staff \n(element 6)  trained by September \n2015  \n \nAt least 100 staff trained \nby September 2015  \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.
