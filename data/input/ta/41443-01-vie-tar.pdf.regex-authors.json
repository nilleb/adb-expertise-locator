INTRODUCTION \n1.  Dialogue between the Government of Viet Nam and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas highlighted the importance of providing timely policy guidance to the Ministry of Transport \n(MOT) and its line agencies.  An ADB fact-finding mission met with MOT officials in April 2010 to \nprepare the technical assistance (TA) and reached an understanding with the government on its \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference. The concept paper of the TA was approved by the director general of the \nADB Southeast Asia Department on 26 March 2010. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. 1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam faces substantial challenges in providing new and improved infrastructure for \nits  rapidly  growing  economy.  Investment  in  the  transport  and  communications  sector  is \nexpanding at a rapid rate and has more than doubled since 2004 as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product (GDP). Transport and communications accounted for 4.5% of GDP in 2009. In \nthe next decade, 2011\u20132020, it is expected that infrastructure development will require as much \nas $16 billion annually, or 20% of projected GDP. In the transport sector, investment in the road \nsubsector predominates, accounting for 3.6% of GDP. However, inefficiencies in the transport \nsector hamper the impact and outcomes of these investments. \n \n3.  ADB's country strategy and program for Viet Nam, 2007\u20132010 and its midterm review \nidentified inefficient management as a key issue in the transport sector.2 The timing of the TA is \nimportant because (i) the road subsector of MOT is being reorganized, with the establishment of \nthe  Directorate  for  Roads  of  Vietnam  (DRVN)  and  the  Vietnam  Expressway  Management \nAdministration3  (VEMA);  (ii)  a  road  maintenance  fund  under  preparation;  (iii) government \nsubsidies  for  expressways  under  consideration;  and  (iv)  development  partners  funding  TA \nprojects4 that will supplement and add value to this TA.   \n \n4.  The  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  for  the  transport  sector  in  Viet  Nam5 \nrecommended (i) developing a governance plan to address comprehensively the institution-\nbuilding and organizational changes required to mitigate the risks of the current institutional \narrangements; (ii) considering the provision of real-time advisory support to the government for \nnew areas of intervention, such as private sector participation in investments; (iii) improving the \nsustainability of projects by gaining government commitment to fund maintenance in close \ncooperation with other development partners; (iv) reviewing bidding arrangements to ensure \nthat  underbidding  does  not  adversely  affect  project  performance  and  that  transparency  is \nmaintained in contracts with equitized6 state-owned enterprises (SOEs); and (v) enhancing \ndesign flexibility.7  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 April 2009.  \n2  ADB. 2006.

MOT is undertaking a major reorganization to create full-service regulating entities for \nroads and expressways. The Vietnam Road Administration was merged with several project \nmanagement units and transformed into the DRVN on 15 March 2010. The responsibilities and \nauthority of the former Vietnam Road Administration were primarily for road operation and \nmaintenance. The newly formed DRVN is more comprehensive, and its responsibilities include \n(i) policy making, planning, investment, and finance; (ii) traffic safety, road management, and \nmaintenance; (iii) vehicle registration and licensing; and (iv) project management. However, \nMOT\u2019s  project  management  units  need  further  improvement  in  management  capability  for \ndeveloping, operating, and maintaining road networks. VEMA will be a regulating entity for \nexpressways and is expected to be established in 2010. MOT has prepared a proposal on the \nscope of VEMA, with support from the World Bank,8 based on studies in nine countries, \nincluding the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Malaysia.  \n \n6.  The Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC) was established as an SOE under MOT in \nOctober 2004. The immediate objective of VEC was to prepare an expressway master plan and \ndevelop new expressways based on it. ADB provided TA to help VEC prepare the master plan.9 \nSince  then,  VEC  has  engaged  in  several  expressway  projects  financed  by  ADB,  other \ndevelopment partners, and the government. The demarcation of responsibilities between VEMA \nand  VEC  needs  to  be  carefully  addressed  when  VEMA  is  established.  The  financial \nsustainability of VEC and the financial viability of its projects will need to be improved as its \nproject portfolio expands. Currently, no tolled expressway is fully operational in Viet Nam, and \nsocial acceptance of, and willingness to pay, expressway tolls are uncertain. ADB supported \nVEC in building a financial information and management system, but it has yet to become fully \noperational.  \n \n7.  The Prime Minister issued a decision10 in January 2010 on the detailed master plan for \nthe  north\u2013south  expressway  (eastern  side),  dividing  the  1,811-kilometer  expressway  into \n16 sections, approving the alignment and technical standards, and providing details of land that \nhas to be appropriated. The decision sets a 14-year schedule for implementation: 2010\u20132023. \nThe expressway is expected to cost $17.9 billion, or about $10 million per kilometer, and will \nrequire an average yearly investment of $1.3 billion during implementation. The funding is \nexpected to come from both the public and the private sector. \n \n8.  Private  sector  participation  in  expressway  projects  is  at  a  nascent  stage.  The \ngovernment needs private sector investment to fill the huge financial gap between infrastructure \ndemand and available budget. The World Bank and the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment  are  working  with  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  on  institutional \narrangements to manage the overall public\u2013private partnership (PPP) program in Viet Nam, \nincluding a regulatory framework for identifying, appraising, and implementing PPP projects. \nThe intent is that the draft framework will be tested through pilot PPP projects, but these pilot \nprojects have not so far been confirmed. The government seeks a PPP arrangement for the My \nThuan\u2013Can Tho expressway project, which ADB was requested to finance. The My Thuan \nproject management unit is currently responsible for the project. MOT plans to transform this \n                                                 \n8  The World Bank is conducting TA for Institutional, Regulatory, and Legal Support for Expressway System \nManagement in 2010. \n9  ADB.  2005.

Many roads across the country are deteriorating because of (i) design standards that are \ninadequate  to  support  traffic  loads  and  (ii)  inadequate  routine  maintenance.  The  National \nAssembly of Viet Nam approved the establishment of road maintenance funds in November \n2008. MOT is working on implementation details of the funds with support from the World Bank. \nHowever, the road asset management system and its database, which will be the basis for \nassessing  maintenance  needs  and  fund  allocations,  remain  incomplete.  ADB  has  been \ncoordinating closely with the Japan International Cooperation Agency, which plans technical \ncooperation to develop a national road infrastructure database in 2010.11 Design standards \nshould be applied flexibly in line with topographical constraints and the nature of traffic so that \nlife-cycle costs can be minimized. \n \n10.  MOT has more than 200 SOEs, half of which are in construction. According to ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), SOEs which are not (i) legally \nand financially autonomous, (ii) operate under commercial law, and (iii) dependent agencies of \nborrower or sub-borrower are ineligible to bid under ADB-financed projects to avoid potential \nconflict of interest. This leaves large and experienced SOEs, particularly those under MOT, \nunable to compete for contracts. However, it started to be recognized and further assessed in \nthe TA that the mechanism and degree of MOT\u2019s control over SOEs has changed recently as a \nresult of SOE reforms like equitization and privatization. ADB's procurement should be carried \nout  in  a  way  that  ensures  all  eligible,  experienced,  and  willing  contractors  are  given  fair \nopportunity, as this will increase competition and promote timely project implementation by \nqualified contractors.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be the transformation of MOT and its line agencies into \nstreamlined and efficient organizations. The outcome of the TA will be road maps, guidelines, \nand assessments to be developed by the TA on key issues in the road transport subsector \nbeing submitted to and reviewed by the appropriate authority within MOT and its line agencies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will help MOT and its line agencies improve their efficiency by (i) removing \noverlapping and outdated public administration, (ii) enhancing the financial resources available \nfor road projects, (iii) improving the cost-effectiveness of road projects, and (iv) improving \ngovernance regarding SOEs. \n  \n13.  The TA will develop road maps, guidelines, and assessments for three components of \nthe road transport subsector: \n(i)  Regarding institutional and financial arrangements, the TA will develop \n(a)  a road map for the long- and medium-term institutional enhancement of \nthe operation of MOT and its line agencies (especially the DRVN and \nVEMA)  and  real-time  advisory  support  to  MOT  officials  through  an \nindividual consultant stationed in MOT; \n                                                 \n11 Technical Cooperation on Project for Capacity Enhancement in Road Maintenance. \n ", "4   \n(b)  an  assessment  of  the  applicability  of  PPP  arrangements  to  the  My \nThuan\u2013Can Tho expressway project; \n(c)  an  assessment  of  financial  arrangements,  such  as  combinations  and \nconditions  of  PPP,  official  development  assistance,  and  government \nsubsidies, for the each section of the north\u2013south expressway (eastern \nside); and \n(d)  a road map for enhancing VEC\u2019s financial management capacity. \n(ii)  Regarding operation and maintenance, the TA will develop modified guidelines \nwith  enhanced  design  flexibility  to  reduce  life-cycle  costs  and  improve  the \nsustainability of expressways, national roads, and local roads. \n(iii)  Regarding governance, the TA will develop \n(a)  guidelines for ADB's procurement involving SOEs under MOT, including \nan assessment for equitized and privatized SOEs and \n(b)  a road map for the participation of selected SOEs under MOT in ADB-\nfinanced projects. \n \n14.  The outputs of the TA will be incorporated into the policy components of planned loan \nprojects. MOT and its line agencies should have strong ownership of inputs to the TA and utilize \nthe TA outputs. ADB staff and the TA consultant will work closely with senior staff of MOT and \nits line agencies. During the institutional modernization and development phase, which will have \na 5-year horizon, ADB will work closely with MOT, its line agencies, and other development \npartners and address institutional capacity issues under future loan and TA projects to ensure \nfull ownership. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,150,000 equivalent, of which $1,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The \ngovernment will finance the remaining cost of $150,000 through in-kind contributions, which will \ncover  office  and  support  facilities,  counterpart  staff,  administrative  support,  and  local \ntransportation for counterpart staff. The cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  MOT will be the executing agency. MOT's line agencies\u2014VEC, the DRVN, VEMA, and \nthe My Thuan project management unit\u2014will be the implementing agencies, which will request \nMOT  to  provide  capacity-building  support  from  the  TA.  The  executing  and  implementing \nagencies will provide in-kind support for the TA.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over the 11 months from October 2010 to August 2011. \nADB will recruit a consulting firm and an individual consultant. The consulting firm will be \nselected by quality- and cost-based selection using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 and simplified \ntechnical proposals. The firm's consultant team will comprise four international experts\u2014a road \ntransport specialist and team leader (9 person-months), public enterprise reform specialist (3 \nperson-months), public financial management specialist (4 person-months), and procurement \nspecialist  (2 person-months)\u2014and  six  national  experts  (21  person-months).  The  individual \nconsultant, a road transport specialist (10 person-months), will be stationed in the MOT office \nand provide hands-on advisory support to MOT senior staff on improving the efficiency of the \nDRVN and VEMA and act as a conduit between MOT and the firm's consulting team. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). TA-financed equipment will be transferred to \n ", "  5\nthe executing agency at the conclusion of the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be done in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  Tripartite  meetings  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  ADB,  and  the \nconsultant team will be held regularly when ADB missions are fielded to discuss outstanding \nissues  and  actions  to  be  taken  to  address  them.  Quadripartite  meetings  including  other \ndevelopment partners will be held in the inception and the final phase, and at other occasions if \nnecessary,  to  discuss  major  findings  and  outputs.  Working  groups,  including  experts  and \nrepresentatives of MOT, its line agencies, provincial people's committees, and development \npartners, will be formulated to discuss such matters as flexible design standards and PPP.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction  for  Strengthening  Institutional  and  Financial  Arrangements,  Operation  and \nMaintenance, and Governance in Road Transport, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Sources and/or \nTargets and/or  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nMOT and its line  Qualified staff are  MOT reports and  The government supports the \nagencies are  appointed to the  minutes of meetings  institutional modernization of \ntransformed into  DRVN, VEMA, and  with MOT and its line  MOT and its line agencies. \nstreamlined and  VEC by 2015.  agencies   \nefficient      Risks \norganizations.
