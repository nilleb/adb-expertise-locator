THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Government of India requested the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto support the development of its regional rapid transit system network, particularly in the National \nCapital Region (NCR). The project aims to improve the efficiency and adequacy of the transport \nsystem in the region by addressing poor rail connectivity and lack of alternative transport modes. \nThe project is designed to ease traffic congestion and promote socio-economic development to \nsupport the NCR\u2019s growing urban population. The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan 2019\u20132021.1 \n \n2.  The project will finance a rail-based rapid transit system with a design speed of 180 km \nper hour (km/h) and an average speed of 100 km/h. It will be a double-line standard gauge, rapid \nrailway system, built on elevated viaducts and going underground in heavily populated areas. It \nwill connect Modipuram in Meerut to Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi. The viaduct will be built along the \ncentral median of the national highway connecting Delhi to Meerut, wherever feasible. The route \nlength of the corridor is 82 km, with 68 km elevated and 14 km underground track. Once \noperational, it will be the fastest, most comfortable and safest mode of commuter transport in the \nNCR. Such seamless connectivity will reduce pollution and congestion in the NCR, thus driving \nbalanced and sustainable urban development in the region. The ADB financing will be used to \ndevelop the Delhi\u2013Meerut RRTS corridor. It will include civil works, alignment, formation, station \nbuildings, multimodal hubs, depot and workshop, permanent way, traction and power supply, \nsignaling and telecom and automatic fare collection system.2 The corridor will be developed in \nfive overlapping stages: (i) construction of viaducts including stations for elevated sections; (ii) \ndesign and construction of tunnels for the underground sections; (iii) trackwork installation and \ntraction  overhead  electrification;  (iv)  signaling  and  telecom  works;  and  (v)  electrical  and \nmechanical works and architectural finishing work of stations. These stages will be funded by \nvarious ADB tranches, hence the MFF will follow a time-sliced\u2013component  approach. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help the government prepare and design \nthe MFF and develop the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies to implement the \nensuing project. The implementing agency has been recently formed to deliver the regional rapid \ntransit corridors. The Delhi\u2013Meerut corridor will be their first project. They are also inexperienced \nregarding ADB procurement processes. Procurement training will be provided to the implementing \nagency to enhance capacity through the TRTA. \n \nB.

The \nconsultant shall broadly perform the following activities. \n \n2.  In accordance with the government\u2019s environmental policy and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement 2009, the consultant will review and confirm the environmental classification of the \nproject and will confirm sections through protected areas such as national park (NP), wildlife \nsanctuary (WS), other sanctuary (S), and reserve forest (RF), if any. From the review, the \nconsultant will complete the rapid environmental assessment (REA) checklist and prepare a brief \nproject description including information on length of sections passing through NP, WS, S, or RF \nareas if any. If the project is classified A, the consultant will draft terms of reference for the EIA \nstudy, to be submitted to the ministry/agency concerned for approval, so required under the \nexisting rules and regulations. After the approval of the TOR for the EIA study, the consultant will \ncarry out the EIA study and prepare an EIA report. The IEE/EIA will be in accordance with the \nrequirements of the government and as well as ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement (SPS) 2009. \n \n3.  The environmental study should clearly identify and describe the area of impact, provide \nan assessment of potential impacts and mitigation measures and involve public consultations with \naffected people and other relevant stakeholders. It should include a comprehensive and practical \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  clear  institutional  arrangements  for  the \nimplementation and monitoring of the EMP. The EIA/IEE report including EMPs must be prepared \nand revised to incorporate feedback from all relevant stakeholders including the NCRTC, ADB, \nand affected persons. Prior to finalization, draft reports should be submitted to the NCRTC and \nADB for review. \n \n4.  In preparing the IEE/EIA the following issues must be investigated: \na.
