Agricultural output in Georgia provides about 7.1% of gross domestic \nproduct, significantly lower than during the Soviet Union period. Nearly 40% of the population is \nemployed  in  low-productivity  subsistence  agriculture  where  self-employment  is  prevalent. \nEffective irrigation and drainage services have been in decline since 2000. This is mainly because \nof a lack of new investments and poor maintenance, and agricultural production and productivity \nhave fallen dramatically.1 In the 1980s, nearly 0.5 million hectares (ha) of farmland were equipped \nfor irrigation. Currently, the irrigation-ready area has shrunk to less than one-fifth of that, and \nyields are low. Factors determining lower yields include water availability, farm sizes, outdated \nproduction practices, and marketing constraints. For example, land remains highly fragmented \nwith an average private landholding size of just 0.7 ha. Moreover, about 50% of all agricultural \nland is leased for smaller farms, which are inefficient. \n \n2.  Food security has become a serious concern for the government and the key driver in \nestablishing  an  efficient  and  sustainable  irrigation  subsector.  The  expected  impacts  of  the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and climate change further highlight the importance \nof improving food production.2 Recognizing the importance of irrigated production systems, \nGeorgia aims to increase the irrigable farmland area to 200,000 ha by 2025. This is an increase \nof around 112,000 ha over 2015 levels.3 Modernizing of irrigation systems is a key to this transition, \nalong with developing output markets and extension services, and adopting on-farm drip irrigation \ntechnology.  \n \n3.  Government responses. By the end of 2012, the Ministry of Agriculture and the state-\nowned  enterprise,  Georgian  Amelioration,  had  initiated  a  corporate  reform  effort,  which  is \nongoing.4 That reforms aim to transform Georgian Amelioration into a financially viable main \nsystem  service  provider  with  local  organizations  as  its  clients.  The  intended  reforms  are \nsummarized in the comprehensive 2017 Irrigation Strategy for Georgia 2017\u20132025. These guide \nirrigation development and management in Georgia for 2017\u20132025.5 \n \n4.  Since 2017, the Government of Georgia, through the Ministry of Environmental Protection \nand  Agriculture  (MEPA),  has  continued  implementing  reforms  to  strengthen  the  irrigation \nsubsector. 6  The  law  supporting  the  formal  establishment  and  operation  of  water  user \norganizations (WUOs) in Georgia was approved by Parliament on 17 December 2019. It transfers \nthe responsibility of managing secondary canals to WUOs to improve local water resource \nmanagement. Similarly, the Law of Georgia on Agricultural Land Ownership was approved in \n2019 to support farmers and improve land ownership rights.  \n \n5.  Development problems. Georgia still needs to take significant steps to ensure the \ndevelopment of an efficient and sustainable irrigation subsector. The 2017 irrigation strategy \nhighlighted the key legal and institutional reforms that are needed to facilitate irrigation expansion, \n \n1  Current production is dominated by cereal grains, though the country\u2019s excellent soils and climatic conditions can \nsupport greatly expanded horticultural crop production.  \n2  While Georgia\u2019s public health response has been generally effective in containing the spread of COVID-19, the \npandemic is having a significant impact on the economy. \n3  Most of the increase is envisaged through modernizing existing gravity irrigation schemes, possibly supplemented \nby pumping surface water and developing groundwater resources.  \n4  Formerly the United Amelioration Systems Company of Georgia. \n5  Ministry of Agriculture and Georgian Amelioration. 2017.

It encompasses \nboth the rehabilitation of decayed irrigation infrastructure and the development of a modern data-\nbased professional and participatory irrigation management capacity. \n \n6.  Specific reform areas of the legal and institutional framework to be addressed under the \nprogram  include  (i)  strengthening  the  implementation  arrangements  for    WUOs  and  land \nregistration, including gender aspects;7 (ii) transforming Georgian Amelioration into a financially \nviable service provider with local organizations as its clients; (iii) improviing water management \nand allocation; and (iv) improving the approval and application process for new irrigation tariffs. \nSuch reforms will reduce the development financing requirements of the government. \n \n7.  Further support is also needed to address a lack of access to modernized approaches \nand technologies for improved irrigation. Current irrigation systems are outdated, and there is a \nlack of capacity of farmers and within Georgian Amelioration to provide state of the art solutions. \nCurrently, farmers have limited opportunities to improve their farming practices, innovate through \nnew farm equipment, and access financing sources. Moreover, the impacts of climate change are \nbecoming an increasing risk for agriculture production, and increasing climate resilience is critical \nto establishing sustainable agricultural production systems. \n \n8.  Proposed solutions. The program will be aligned with the following impact: agriculture \nproduction and food security improved.8 The program will have three outputs: the policy-based \nloan will support sector reforms under output 1, and the investment loan will support outputs 2 \nand 3. Sector reforms are required to enable the introduction of a sustainable food production \nsystem under outputs 2 and 3. These outputs will result in the following outcome: modernized \nirrigation approaches implemented in eastern Georgia.9  \n \n9.  Output  1:  Institutional,  governance,  management,  and  financial  management \nenhanced. This output will support the MEPA to strengthen its institutional capacity, financial \nmanagement, and policies to improve the agriculture sector, and to increase its contribution to \nthe economy and development objectives of Georgia. The government is strongly committed to \nimplementing necessary institutional and legal changes to achieve the irrigation reform strategy. \nBased on initial discussions with the government, the policy actions are expected to focus on (i) \nstrengthening the local implementation regulations and arrangements of the 2019 Law of Georgia \non Water User Organizations and the 2019 Law of Georgia on Agricultural Land Ownership, (ii) \nreforming Georgian Amelioration to transform it into a more accountable and transparent bulk \nwater supply organization, (iii) improving reservoir management and water allocation, and (iv) \nimproving the approval and application process of new irrigation tariffs.10 The policy reforms are \nrequired for an enabling policy environment for outputs 2 and 3. \n \n10.  Output 2: Irrigation schemes modernized. Output 2 will support the modernization of \noutdated irrigation systems in the eastern part of Georgia. Depending on the potential for \nincreased loan allocation, it is envisaged that output 2 will comprise two key subcomponents: (i) \nmodernization of the Kvemo Samgori left main canal and (ii) modernization of the Tbisi-Kumisi \nirrigation system. Envisaged investments include the modernization of critical reaches of the \n \n7  For example, men own 62% of agricultural land while women own 37%.

Based on the due diligence process for the \nensuing program, additional investment opportunities may be identified that will contribute to the \nprogram outcome and required modernization.  \n \n11.  Output 3: Innovative agriculture production systems demonstrated. Output 3 will \nsupport  WUOs,  farmers,  and  farmer  organizations  to  further  improve  and  modernize  their \nproduction systems. The output will have two subcomponents: (i) demonstration and introduction \nof  innovative  on-farm  technologies  and  (ii)  capacity  development  of  farmers  and  farmer \norganizations. Innovative on-farm technological improvement could include (i) introduction water- \nsaving irrigation infrastructure (including high-efficiency irrigation systems and laser land leveling), \ndigital technologies, and remote sensing, e.g., for irrigation scheduling; (ii) utilizing local water \nstorage and recycling opportunities; (iii) supporting for high-value crop production; and (iv) using \nadvanced water management and resource monitoring. The approach for on-farm improvements \nwill use the lessons learned from the practices introduced by, for example, the projects financed \nby the World Bank.11 \n \n12.  The program is included in the country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023, and is \nconsistent with the Georgia country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023, which includes support for \nstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.12 Extensive  donor  coordination  will  be \nconducted with Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement for possible cofinancing, the International \nMonetary Fund for the policy component, and the World Bank for consistency with its support in \nthe irrigation subsector.  \n \n13.  The proposed program will be aligned with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy \n2030, particularly for the operational priorities (OPs) that involve (i) addressing remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities (OP1); (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality (OP2); (iii) tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability  (OP3);  (iv)  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security  (OP5);  and  (v) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity (OP6).13  \n \n14.  Proposed financing plans and modality. The policy component will be implemented \nfrom December 2021 to November 2024. The investment component will be implemented from \nDecember 2021 to November 2026. The program is estimated to cost $140 million, of which ADB \nis requested to finance $75 million. The policy-based loan component is estimated to cost $50 \nmillion, of which ADB will finance $50 million. The investment component is estimated to cost $90 \nmillion, of which ADB will finance $25 million. Cofinancing of an indicative $25 million by other \ndevelopment partners will be sought. ADB will either fully or partially administer the cofinancing. \nThe  central  and  local  governments  will  provide  counterpart  financing  for  the  investment \ncomponent  to  cover  taxes  and  duties,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  and  other \nmiscellaneous costs. These are currently estimated at $20 million. Opportunities for cash or in-\nkind contributions from local beneficiaries will be explored.  \n \n15.  The modality of the program will be a sector development program using a programmatic \napproach.  The  policy-based  lending  component,  estimated  at  $50  million,  will  support  the \ngovernment with making the necessary reforms in the irrigation subsector. These are needed to \nestablish cost-recovery and equitable water allocation mechanisms to successfully implement the \n \n11 World Bank. 2014. Irrigation and Land Market Development Project.
