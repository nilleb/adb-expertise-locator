In Papua New Guinea (PNG), progress in achieving the  Millenium Development Goals \n(MDGs) will require increased and sustained public investment in education and health. Levels \nof social indicators remain extremely poor, especially for women. Low life expectancy, high \ninfant mortality, poor adult literacy, and low enrolment at all levels of education combine with low \nper  capita  income  to  make  PNG\u2019s  human  development  level  the  lowest  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Pacific Developing Member Countries. The poor achievement to date \nreflects lack of spending on essential services and inadequate development management under \ndifficult physical and social conditions. The minimal progress achieved in life expectancy is now \njeopardized by a large-scale HIV/AIDS1 epidemic. In the country strategy and program update \nand forthcoming Country Strategy Program (CSP), ADB\u2019s strategy for PNG highlights HIV/AIDS \nas a critical issue, and ADB, together with other  development partners, is raising the profile of \nHIV care and prevention.  \n \n2.  A joint United Nations/ United States Agency for International Development (UN-USAID) \nreview of the PNG National HIV Medium Term-Plan 1998-2002  (MTP) conducted in December \n2002 confirmed that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is generalized and severe, and identified serious \ngaps in the national response to  it. The Government  has requested ADB assistance in this \nsector,  to  be  undertaken  in  conjunction  with  parallel  assistance  from  the  World  Health \nOrganization  (WHO).  The  Technical  Assistance  (TA)2  objectives,  scope,  financing,  and \nimplementation  arrangements  were  reconfirmed  during  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  of  13\u201321 \nAugust 2003. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The first HIV infections in PNG were reported in 1987; since then, HIV prevalence has \nbeen increasing at an alarming rate. In mid-2002 PNG became the fourth country in the Asia-\nPacific region, after Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar, to have a generalized HIV epidemic.3 \nThe prevalence of HIV among antenatal women in Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) and \nGoroka  Hospital reached 1% in the first half of 2002.4 The  situation in the rural areas  is \nunknown, but the pattern of population movements between urban and rural areas suggests \nthat the virus is now largely present in the country. AIDS is now the major cause of death in \nPMGH, and one in six sex workers is infected.  Many people are diagnosed with HIV when their \nimmune system is already severely weakened. In some hospitals, HIV and tuberculosis patients \nare housed in the same ward. The public health system cannot cope with the increased burden \nof illness. The main mode of transmission is heterosexual intercourse,5 and the male-female \nratio of HIV infection is almost equal, with 51% found in males. However, a much higher HIV \nprevalence is found in 13\u201322-year-old females compared to males of the same age. Increasing \nurban and rural poverty has led to rising levels of crime and growth of the sex trade. Prevalence \nof  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs)  is  among  the  highest  in  the  world,  even  among \nsupposedly \u201clow-risk\u201d rural populations. These figures are attributed to  high levels of risky \nbehavior, sexual violence, and failure of the public health system to provide accessible clinical \n                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \n2  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 28 August 2003. \n3  The severity of the epidemic is reflected in the fact that the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS \n(UNAIDS) has recently scaled up its presence, with the appointment a permanent country coordinator in PNG. \n4  Comparable to South African statistics in 1992. \n5  Comprising 89% of cases. ", "2 \nservices.6 WHO estimates that PNG generates  over 1 million  new  cases  of  curable STIs \nannually, and that the STI services are not seeing more than 1% of all cases. STIs are major \ncofactors in the transmission of HIV. The evidence is clearly pointing to a southern African-type \nsocial-epidemiological pattern in HIV transmission, and HIV is a serious threat to PNG\u2019s future. \n \n4.  PNG was not able to submit a proposal at the first round of the Global Fund7 and the \nproposal (for $6.4 million) presented at the second round was rejected. The latter proposal was \nfor an HIV prevention program to change behavior among sex workers, their clients, and 14\u201319-\nyear old youths. Some comments reported by the Global Fund technical review panel were that \n\"there was no mention of HIV treatment in the proposal\" and that \"much of the budget was \nallocated for government spending.\" This proposal was not recommended for funding in its \npresent  form  but  strongly  encouraged  to  be  resubmitted  after  revision  following  the \nrecommendations of the panel. A new proposal was submitted in May 2003, but whether it will \nbe accepted or not is unknown.  \n \n5.  The Government\u2019s capacity to respond strongly and rapidly is scant. The MTP was a \nbroad-based multisectoral approach to a national response. The MTP did not set priorities or \npresent an implementation plan or costing, and served more as a guide than a strategic plan. \nFew of the MTP\u2019s aims have been accomplished. The MTP makes no commitment to improve \nmedical care of HIV-positive people, and provides for no mechanisms to provide home care, \nsupport  groups,  or  community  care  centers.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (AusAID) is reviewing its  prevention strategy,8 but care for people with HIV \nremains almost nonexistent, except where  church health services  have attempted to build \nprograms of home-based and day care. Their capacity is limited compared to the magnitude of \nthe problem.  Voluntary testing  is nonexistent,  and most people  still do not receive pre- and \nposttest counseling, despite  large investment in  counselor training. Experience  in Asia and \nAfrica shows that, provided they have strong support from peers and/or families, HIV-positive \npeople who are involved in awareness raising and care delivery can demonstrate that they can \nstill live long, productive lives. However, people newly diagnosed in PNG are rarely referred on \nto  other  HIV-positive  people  or  organizations  that  offer  counseling.  Although  overall \ndiscrimination may be subsiding in Port Moresby, stigma and discrimination remain strong. \nUninformed health workers are reluctant to care for people infected with HIV. Children orphaned \nby AIDS are reportedly rejected by families and live on the streets of Port Moresby, trying to \nsupport themselves.9 A radically new approach is required to meet the increasingly desperate \nneeds of those affected by HIV/AIDS.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n6.  The rapid increase in HIV/AIDS cases urgently requires treatment strategies, including \nanti-retroviral medication (ARV).  When the MTP was drafted, access to ARV was  financially \nimpossible for PNG. Today, these drugs are becoming available in the region for approximately \n$1 per day. However,  facilities are lacking  to manage the impact of treatments, including \n                                                 \n6 The massive decrease in aid posts has severely cut the number of facilities available for primary health care. \nChurches provide approximately 51% of all health services, but concerns about morality and Christian values \namong staff tend to limit access of many patients to user-friendly STI services.  \n7 The purpose of the fund is to attract, manage, and disburse additional resources through a new public-private \npartnership that will reduce, significantly and in a sustainable manner, infections, illness, and death, thereby \nmitigating the impact caused by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and helping reduce poverty.  \n8  AusAID is supporting the national and provincial AIDS council secretariats implement the MTP through the National \nHIV/AIDS Support Project, 2000-2005 ($33 million). \n9  Around 3,000 children, many AIDS orphans, are estimated to be living on the streets of Port Moresby. ", "    3 \ntoxicity, side effects, and adherence, and unsupervised treatment could increase resistance and \niatrogenic10 accidents.   \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA will support, on a pilot basis, the development of a model for HIV/AIDS care, \nbased on private-public networks and partnerships to expand care and treatment facilities. \nPossible funding from the Global Fund is expected to enable replication and sustainability of this \nscheme. To increase the access of HIV-infected people to comprehensive care, treatment, and \nsupport, a small number of pilot facilities within the existing health system will be established. \nOne center will be initially established in PMGH, and, later, one in a church health facility in a \nhigh-prevalence area.  The Catholic HIV/AIDS Program  has already expressed interest in \nselecting one of the Catholic hospitals as a pilot HIV treatment center. The introduction of  a \nselected number ofARVs will greatly improve the quality of life of people infected by the virus, \nallowing them to stay economically and socially active. Priority will be given to reducing mother-\nto-child transmission. WHO has recommended that PNG be placed in the group  of countries \ngiven priority  in  increasing access to ARV medication  through  the  International  Treatment \nAccess Coalition (ITAC). By  involving people living with HIV/AIDS (PHA) in the support of newly \ninfected people, the Project is also expected to reduce the stigma and discrimination suffered by \npeople infected by the virus.  \n \n8.  The outputs of the TA are the following: \n \n(i)  By the end of 2004 the following should be accomplished: \n \n(a)  at least one clinic established in PMGH, with trained staff and outreach \nnetwork of community-based organizations; \n(b)  100  patients  receiving  comprehensive  clinical  care,  counseling,  and \nsupport, including access to, and monitoring of, ARV treatment; and \n(c)  strengthened capacity for community support for care and counseling of \nHIV/AIDS patients. \n \n  (ii)  By October 2005 the following should be accomplished: \n \n(a)  3,000 patients treated; and \n(b)  a pilot center established in a church hospital. \n \n9.  HIV-infected people will be involved in the pilot center design; the PMGH center will work \nwith nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and churches to identify the cases and guarantee \ncompliance with treatment. The preliminary feasibility study has been prepared by the National \nDepartment of Health (NDOH) and PMGH. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Considering international experience and best practices, HIV/AIDS care and support will \nbe based on the following principles: \n \n(i)  voluntary  counseling  and  testing  network  to  serve  as  an  entry  point  to  the \ncomprehensive care system; \n                                                 \n10 Accidents resulting from toxicity of the treatment. ", "4 \n(ii)  access  to  HIV/AIDS  drugs,  including  ARV  drugs,  as  well  as  treatment  of \nopportunistic infections; \n(iii)  continuum of care from home to health facility; and \n(iv)  involvement of PHA in counseling and support.  \n \n11.  The TA will be organized around (i) establishment of pilot centers in the public health \nsystem (PMGH) and in a church facility; and (ii) development of national treatment guidelines \nand protocols, and review and revision of national drug policies and procedures.  \n \n1.  Establishment of Pilot Centers  \n \n12.  The first center will be the PMGH HIV Clinic and Day-Care Center (public health system). \nExisting facilities (STI clinic) on the grounds of PMGH will be used to provide an expanded system \nof care for PHA. Initially, the focus will be on building the capacity of staff to provide services to \nPHA, equip the center, and build referral systems and partnerships necessary for the functioning of \nthe Center. Discussions will be held with a number of NGOs (Salvation Army, etc.)  that can \nconduct home visits and care  and thus provide the foundation  for a center outreach  network. \nNDOH will procure ARV with the support of WHO country and regional offices. The second center \nwill be a pilot in a church hospital in a high-prevalence area. The Catholic HIV/AIDS Program has \nalready expressed interest in selecting one Catholic hospital as a pilot HIV treatment center. \nExperience in establishing and running these pilot centers will be used in the design and planning \nof more HIV clinics in the provinces. \n \n2.  Development of National Treatment Guidelines and Protocols  \n \n13.  WHO guidelines for a public-health approach to ARV treatment, Scaling Up Antiretroviral \nTherapy in Resource-Limited Settings\u201d (June 2002), will provide the overriding policy framework. \nNational treatment guidelines will be formulated within this framework. Priority will be placed on \nclinical guidelines, selection criteria of ARV enrollment, and a protocol to ensure adherence to the \ntreatment. The TA will help NDOH establish and monitor a national program of comprehensive HIV \ncare, treatment, and support. This program will be within the framework of the new national MTP \nfor  HIV/AIDS.  NDOH  will  work  collaboratively  with  the  National  HIV/AIDS  Council  and  its \nsecretariat. The  chief physician of PNG and  consultant physician at  PMGH will  implement the \nnational strategy to increase access to HIV treatment in PNG under the secretary of health and in \ncollaboration with the National AIDS Council (NAC).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total TA cost is estimated at $655,000 equivalent, comprising $422,000 equivalent \nin foreign exchange costs and $233,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram  will  finance  $360,000  of  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $90,000  equivalent  of  local \ncurrency cost on a grant basis. ADB financing will cover consulting services, procurement of \nequipment, laboratory reagents and drugs, organization of workshops, transport costs, and \nproduction of reports. WHO will contribute $72,000 equivalent on a parallel basis for consulting \nservices, procurement of drugs, and organization of workshops. The balance of $133,000 \nequivalent will be provided by the Government in the form of counterpart staff, support services, \nand office facilities. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  NDOH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  will  provide  office  space  and  full-time \ncounterpart staff (one physician and three nurses) of the STI clinic in PMGH. WHO will initially \nhire a consultant for 3 person-months to start preparing for implementation, focusing mainly on \nestablishing the network between  community based organizations (CBOs) supporting PHAs, \nand the health system.  The TA will last about 30 months beginning in October 2003. The TA \nwill  require  11  person-months  of  international  consulting  services.  The  consultant  will  be \nrecruited  on  an  individual  basis,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Terms of reference are in Appendix 4. The consultant will submit (i) an inception \nreport one month after fielding; (ii) a progress report at the end of the 12th month of TA \nimplementation; (iii) a draft final report at the end of the 24th month of TA implementation; and \n(iv) a final report within one month of receiving ADB\u2019s comments, if any, on the draft final report. \n \n16.  The training and workshops will be organized by NDOH with  technical support  from \nWHO.  NDOH  will  procure  drugs  and  reagent  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement, with technical support from WHO and  WPRO.11 WHO will provide technical \nsupport through an HIV/AIDS care adviser based in the PNG WHO office, supported by regular \nmissions of the  WPRO team (epidemiologist and care adviser), and will coordinate all the \ninputs. \n \n17.  Information on treatment and protocols will be disseminated to other health services \nthroughout PNG.  Building on the lessons learned, similar clinics will be established in other \nrural and urban centers in high-prevalence areas. It is expected that financing obtained under \nthe GF will ensure the sustainability of this scheme. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Papua New Guinea for the Establishment of Pilot HIV/AIDS Care Centers, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11 WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific.

Levels of social indicators remain extremely poor, especially for women. \nLow life expectancy, high infant mortality, poor adult literacy, and low enrolment at all levels of education combine with \nlow per capita income to make PNG\u2019s human development level the lowest of the ADB\u2019s Pacific member countries. \nThe poor achievement to date reflects past  lack of spending on essential services and inadequate development \nmanagement under difficult physical and social conditions.
