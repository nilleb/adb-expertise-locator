During the June 2009 country programming meetings in Beijing, capacity development \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Concentrating Solar Thermal Power Development was discussed \nwith the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which led to its inclusion in the \n2009 country assistance pipeline of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 During the TA fact-\nfinding  mission  in  October  2009,  ADB  reached  an  understanding  with  the  China  Huadian \nEngineering Company (CHEC) and the government on the impact, outcome, methodology and \nkey activities, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, consulting services\u2019 inputs, outline terms of \nreference  for  consultants,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  TA.2 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In the PRC, significant coal consumption and its expected growth trajectory up to 2020 \nare major concerns for local, regional, and global emissions. The PRC is the world\u2019s second-\nlargest energy consumer after the United States and has the fastest-growing energy sector in \nthe world. Its electricity generation in 2008 was 3,433 terawatt-hours, of which almost 81% was \nfrom  coal,  16%  from  hydropower,  2%  from  nuclear,  and  about  1%  from  wind  and  other \nalternative sources. Also that year, total coal production was more than 2.6 billion tons, and \nelectricity generation consumed about 50% of that total. Thus, diversification of the PRC\u2019s \nenergy mix to include more renewable, nuclear, and other alternative sources is a priority. In \n2006, the government enacted the Renewable Energy Law, which provides incentives and \npolicy  support  to  accelerate  renewable  energy  development,  especially  solar,  wind,  and \nbiomass. The law also includes a regulatory framework for renewable energy development.    \n \n3.  Since 2007, the PRC has witnessed significant growth in its large-scale wind power \ndevelopment. Recent estimates suggest that 10 gigawatts (GW) of wind power capacity have \nbeen added in the past 3 years. In contrast, solar power development has been rather limited. \nAlthough  solar  power  is  used  for  off-grid  application  in  smaller  installations,  large  grid\u2013\nconnected solar power capacity was only about 100 megawatts (MW) by the end of 2008, \nalmost all of which was photovoltaic installations of varying capacity. This slower development \nof solar power is attributable to (i) high project development costs; (ii) high capital investment \nand cost of electricity compared to wind; (iii) lack of accurate solar resource assessment data \nand mapping; and (iv) limited in-country technology and technical expertise on concentrating \nsolar thermal (CST) power, which is more cost-effective and uses grid connections.  \n \n4.  CST power provides electricity by generating medium to high heat, which is then used to \noperate a conventional steam turbine that drives a generator. Because such technology uses a \nthermal  phase,  power  production  is  continuous  and  can  be  dispatched,  alleviating  the \nintermittence problem associated with wind or solar photovoltaic installations. In addition, a cost \ncomparison of CST and photovoltaic technologies as reflected in a recent International Energy \nAgency (IEA) report suggests that CST power is more cost competitive.3    \n \n5.  To  jump-start  large,  grid\u2013connected  solar  power  development,  the  government  has \nrecently set a target of developing 2 GW of solar power by 2011 and 30 GW by 2020.4 In \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 5 October 2009. \n2  CHEC is a state-owned enterprise and is a group of company of China Huadian, one of the five large state-owned \ngenerating companies in PRC. \n3  IEA. 2003. Renewables for Power Generation\u2014Status and Prospects. Paris.  \n4  The revised solar power targets were announced by the National Energy Administration in July 2009.  \n ", "2 \naddition,  it  has  recently  included  a  MW-scale,  CST  power  demonstration  project  for \nimplementation during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period, 2006\u20132010. It has also provided \npolicy  support  through  a  ceiling  tariff  of  CNY2.00  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  for  large  grid\u2013\nconnected solar power projects; accordingly, the government concluded the bidding process for \na  10-MW  photovoltaic  installation  in  Gansu  Province,  with  a  tariff  of  CNY1.09/kWh.  It  is \nexpected that the construction of a CST power plant will bring down the electricity tariff to an \neven more agreeable level to policy and decision makers, as such a plant can provide electricity \nin the range of CNY0.70 to CNY1.0/kWh, with further long-term cost reduction.  \n \n6.  There is lack of knowledge and expertise to decide appropriate CST power technologies \nfor use in the PRC.5 Understanding new technologies through MW-scale pilot projects is crucial \nto build up knowledge and capacity, which may lead to development of at-scale (50\u2013100 MW) \nplants. But unlike photovoltaic technology, which uses diffused solar radiation and can be used \nin wider geographical areas, CST power technology requires direct solar radiation gain. Thus, \nits competitive market potential is limited to arid and semi-arid areas such as Gansu, Inner \nMongolia, Qinghai, Tibet, and Xinjiang. However, most of these areas are far from major load \ncenters and located in relatively underdeveloped provinces, which present further challenges to \nattract the project developers, who may not prefer to invest higher up-front project development \ncost for CST plants in remote sites.    \n \n7.  Being a high-priority area for the government, the TA\u2019s focus is expected to receive full \nsupport from relevant provincial and national agencies. The current momentum for renewable \nenergy in the PRC is expected to be further intensified by the government in the remainder of \nthe  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  and  carried  forward  in  the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan.  The \ngovernment's sector vision\u2014a 15% capacity addition of electricity production from renewable \nenergy  by  2020  and  policies  for  higher  tariff  from  renewable  energy6\u2014have  considerably \nlowered risks for CST power demonstration projects. However, the risks of technology and high \ncosts remain, which can be addressed by implementing a MW-scale pilot and lowering the \ndevelopment cost of at-scale demonstration projects through the TA. \n \n8.  The TA has direct relevance to the country partnership strategy, which emphasizes \nenvironmentally sustainable development and inclusive growth.7 ADB's operational strategy also \nhighlights inclusive economic growth in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner. In its \nlong-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020), ADB has identified energy as a core \noperational sector and achieving environmental sustainability a strategic priority.8 The TA will \naddress relatively weak solar power development in the PRC, which is an integral part of \nclimate change mitigation strategies of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)9 \nand IEA.  \n \n9.  The TA is ADB\u2019s first solar power intervention in the PRC, and capacity strengthening, \npilot project implementation, and prefeasibility assessment of an at-scale demonstration project \n                                                 \n5  A wide range of solar-concentrating technologies exist, including the parabolic trough, dish stirling, concentrating \nlinear fresnel reflector, and solar power tower. Each method is capable of producing high temperatures and \ncorrespondingly high thermodynamic efficiencies, but they vary in how they track the sun and focus light. \n6  As per the Renewable Energy Law (2006), it includes wind, solar, small hydropower, biomass and geothermal.  \n7  ADB. 2008.

It \nwill build on lower-carbon emission interventions in PRC's energy sector, such as (i) renewable \nenergy (wind and biomass), (ii) clean coal technologies (integrated gasification combined cycle \nand carbon capture and storage), and (iii) energy efficiency. The TA is fully aligned with the \ngovernment's priority on saving energy and protecting the environment by seeking a more \nbalanced, diversified energy mix with a stronger emphasis on renewable energy.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the TA will be that CST power demonstration starts in the PRC by 2012. \nThe outcome will be lowered capacity barriers for such demonstration. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The key outputs of the TA include (i) development of a  road map for CST power \ndemonstration and deployment in Gansu Province, (ii) implementation of a pilot MW-scale CST \npower plant, (iii) identification of a priority demonstration project and prefeasibility assessment in \nGansu Province, (iv) capacity assessment and strengthening of CST power demonstration, and \n(v)  dissemination  of  knowledge  products  to  relevant  provinces  on  lessons  learned  and \nchallenges in CST power development. \n \n12.  Close coordination will be maintained with relevant stakeholders during implementation \nto ensure that the TA takes previous studies, government priorities, existing plans, and results \nof pilot tests into account. Experts from relevant research institutes will be consulted on current \nCST power practices, priorities, and plans, and identifying programmatic options for CST power \ndevelopment. Suitable criteria will be determined for the selection of priority and pilot projects, \nwhich will be endorsed by the government.  \n \n13.  Consultants will examine international best practices and methods that can be used in \nthe development of a road map for the CST power demonstration project, summarize features, \nand make appropriate recommendations. The essential and desirable features of the road map \nwill be listed at an early stage, and consensus will be built around these. When a preliminary \nstructure and outline are available, consultants will use the information flow from the pilot \nprojects and further analytical and research activities to refine the road map. The road map will \nalso estimate the threshold level of CST capacity that will be critical to achieve the grid parity \ntariff by eliminating the current preferential tariff adopted by the government for solar power \ndevelopment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $2,700,000 equivalent. ADB will finance \n$1,000,000 equivalent on a grant basis through the Climate Change Fund.10 The Government \nwill finance the remaining $1,700,000, including $850,000 for the pilot project and the rest \nthrough in-kind contributions,  such as office accommodation  and support  facilities, counterpart  \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n10 Established by ADB. \n ", "4 \nstaff members, and data.11 Some office and pilot project equipment will be financed under the \nTA,  which  will  be  procured  by  the  international  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  handed  over  to  the \nexecuting agency upon TA completion.12 The in-kind contribution will be provided by CHEC or \nother relevant agencies involved in the pilot project implementation. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are attached in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  CHEC will be the executing agency, responsible for day-to-day implementation of TA \nactivities, coordination with other key stakeholders, and logistical support to the consultants. It \nhas already created a project management office in its head office.  \n \n16.  ADB will engage international and national consultants, according to its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A simplified technical proposal \nwill be requested by ADB, and consultants will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method with quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. An estimated total of 50 person-months of \nconsulting services will be required\u201410 person-months for international consultants and 40 \nperson-months for national consultants. The international consultants will have expertise in (i) \nCST power technology and strategy development, (ii) technical areas of CST power plants, and \n(iii) financial modeling and analysis. The national consultants will have expertise similar to the \ninternational experts and will have in-depth knowledge and expertise in the PRC on these areas. \nIn addition, the national consultants will include experts in key technical areas of (i) reflector \noptical design, (ii) structural design, (iii) automatic tracking systems, (iv) thermal storage system \ndesign, and (v) system integration. The national consultants' team will also include an energy \neconomist and a coordinator. In addition, to support the consultants' team in the pilot project \nimplementation and prefeasibility assessment of demonstration project, two safeguard experts \nin the areas of environment and social development will be included. The international CST \ntechnology and strategy development expert will be the team leader, while a national CST \npower system integration expert will be the co-team leader. The co-team leader, will closely \ncoordinate among national consultants and with the international team leader to ensure that TA \nactivities are implemented efficiently in a coherent manner. The national coordinator will assist \nthe  project  management  office  with  key  TA  administrative  tasks  to  ensure  that  the  TA \nimplementation is smooth. The team leader and co-team leader will manage the consulting \nteam and its interaction with the executing agency, ADB, and stakeholders. The outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are given in Appendix 3. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed \nin line with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.13 \n \n17.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  13  months  beginning  in  February  2010,  with  an \nexpected completion date of March 2011. The consultants will submit an inception report within \n4 weeks, an interim report within 15 weeks, a midterm report within 28 weeks, a draft final report \nwithin 45 weeks, and a final report within 55 weeks of field mobilization.
