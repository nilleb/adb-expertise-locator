THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \nA.  Justification \n1.  Government  requests.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  (the  government)  and \nO\u2019zbekiston  Temir  Yo\u2019llari  (UTY)  have  requested  technical  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to prepare two projects to further modernize railways in Uzbekistan.1 \n \n2.  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Corridor  2  (Pap\u2013\nNamangan\u2013Andijan) Railway Electrification Project-Additional Financing. The first project \naims to complete the modernization of the railway network linking Tashkent with major cities and \ntowns  in  the  populous  Fergana  Valley.  It  directly  complements  the  work  currently  being \nundertaken under the current project2 to electrify and modernize the Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan \nsection in the Fergana Valley, as well as the work completed by the government and UTY with \nassistance of People\u2019s Republic of China and the World Bank for the construction of the Angren\u2013\nPap railway through the Kamchik Pass. Despite these efforts, signaling and telecommunications \nsystems  remain  uninstalled  on  the  section  Angren\u2013Pap\u2013Kokand\u2013Andijan,  greatly  affecting \nefficiency and safety of rail operations. Although all sections are already electrified (or soon to be \nelectrified), there are limits on the frequency and number of trains that can be run, due to the \nshortage  of  traction  substations.  The  additional  financing  will  help  install  signaling  and \ntelecommunications on the Angren\u2013Pap\u2013Kokand\u2013Andijan line, as well as construct two new \ntraction substations to relieve the shortage of electric power on the line. The additional financing \nwill also aim to upgrade train control and management systems. \n \n3.  CAREC  Corridor  2  (Bukhara\u2013Miskin\u2013Urgench\u2013Khiva)  Railway  Electrification \nProject. The project aims to electrify the existing railway line linking Bukhara, Miskin, Urgench \nand Khiva. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s strategy to diversify the economy and \ndevelop the tourism sector in the Khorezm region. With electrification, the route can be served by \nhigh-speed passenger trains already in operation on other parts of the network. This will shorten \ntravel times between Bukhara and Khiva from the current 6 hours by road, down to 2. The top \ntourist destinations of Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, and Khiva will be connected by high-speed \nrail, significantly improving the attractiveness of Uzbekistan as a tourism destination. The project \nwill upgrade the railway along the Bukhara\u2013Miskin\u2013Urgench\u2013Khiva line, including (i) construction \nof 8 traction substations, (ii) construction of 8 section posts, (iii) installation of catenary systems, \n(iv) installation of signaling, telecoms and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) \nsystems, and (v) construction of external power supply. The project will also help create a tourism \neconomic corridor by supporting sustainable tourism, transit-oriented development along the \nrailway corridor, and an electronic ticketing system to enhance the attractiveness of railway \ntransport. \n \n4.  Strategic location of Uzbekistan. Surrounded by Afghanistan to the south, Kazakhstan \nto the north and northwest, the Kyrgyz Republic to the northeast, Turkmenistan to the southwest, \nand Tajikistan to the southeast, Uzbekistan serves three of six CAREC corridors. With about \n33  million  people,  Uzbekistan  is  the  most  populous  country  in  Central  Asia.  It  is  doubly \nlandlocked\u2014requiring crossing at least two countries to reach a seaport\u2014so transport plays an \nimportant role in sustaining its socioeconomic development. Both of the two new projects take \n                                                \n1  These lending proposals are included in ADB. 2019.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic \nof Uzbekistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridor 2 (Pap-Namangan-Andijan) Railway \nElectrification Project. Manila \n ", "2 \ninto account this strategic location of Uzbekistan, and strengthens Uzbekistan\u2019s role as a regional \ntransport hub. \n \n5.  Critical role of railways. Rail transport has a unique competitive advantage over road \ntransport for moving goods in bulk over long distances, as well as for moving passengers between \ndensely  populated  cities.  The  4,669-kilometer  Uzbekistan  rail  network  carries  about \n68 million tons of freight and 21 million passengers annually. In Uzbekistan\u2019s land transport \nsystem, railways carry about 40% of the total freight volume, and about 4% of the total passenger \nvolume.3 Since 2004, Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product has on average grown by more than \n7% per year. This has contributed to strong demand for rail transport. Ongoing improvements in \nthe  relationship  between  Uzbekistan  and  its  neighbors  will  further  add  to  such  demand. \nThe CAREC Railway Strategy 2017\u20132030 notes the role of railways as an engine for economic \ngrowth in Central Asia, especially as they help countries to diversify trade patterns, attract foreign \ndirect investment, increase participation in global production networks, increase related trade in \nmanufactured products, and diversify exports.4 \n \n6.  Consistency with national development objectives. The government\u2019s Development \nStrategy for 2017\u20132021 pursues five priority areas: (i) improvement of the system of state and \npublic construction; (ii) safeguarding of the rule of law and further reform of the judicial system; \n(iii)  economic  development  and  liberalization;  (iv)  development  of  the  social  sectors;  and \n(v) security, inter-ethnic harmony and religious tolerance, and implementation of a balanced and \nmutually beneficial and constructive foreign policy.5 Transport and communication are seen as \nkey in supporting priority areas (iii) and (iv), and the strategy specifically mentions the importance \nof improving transport services, raising passenger safety, and reducing harmful emissions. \n \n7.  Consistency with ADB\u2019s Strategy. The projects are consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nand in particular its operational priorities in (i) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience and ensuring environmental sustainability, (ii) strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity, and (iii) fostering regional cooperation and integration.6 The expansion of a \nmodernized railway network will cut greenhouse gases and also reduce local air pollution. \nThe improved speeds and efficiency of train services brought about by the projects will help \nreduce journey time on Uzbekistan\u2019s railway network, improve service quality and reliability on \nthe CAREC transport network, and strengthen the conditions for the private sector to grow. \nThe railway links to be improved through the two ensuing projects are on CAREC Corridor 2, \nwhich serve the vital East\u2013West trade corridor linking the People\u2019s Republic of China, through \nCentral Asia, to Europe. The projects thereby contribute to the goals of the CAREC Railway \nStrategy 2030, which is to make railways a mode of choice for trade: quick, efficient, accessible \nto customers, and easy to use throughout the region. The projects are consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023,7 which calls for investments in the \ntransport sector and the modernization of railway infrastructure. The projects are included in the \nindicative country operations business plan for Uzbekistan, 2020\u20132022.8 \n \n8.  Major achievements by Uzbekistan to modernize railways. Since its foundation in \n1994, UTY has gradually implemented a holistic railway modernization program, including the \n                                                \n3  United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. 2019.

These efforts were \nsupported  by  ADB,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, German development cooperation through KfW, the Kuwait \nFund for Arab Economic Development, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) \nFund for International Development, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the World Bank. \n \n9.  UTY  has  worked  with  development  partners  to  undertake  institutional  reforms. \nWith support from ADB, the government initiated UTY reforms in 1997, under which ancillary \nservices such as health, recreation, and education were largely separated from core operations.10 \nThe  downsizing  of  staff  and  noncore  assets  improved  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of \noperations. As part of the recently approved Railway Efficiency Improvement Project, UTY is \ncommitted to preparing a long-term development strategy to guide its future operations.  \n \n10.  Remaining challenges. Based on the above achievements, UTY has the scope to further \nshorten transport time, improve service quality, and reduce operating costs by accelerating the \nmodernization of its railway network and modernizing its practices. This would allow railways to \nremain competitive against road transport, and help improve economic opportunities, boost \nregional trade, and reduce environmental impacts for the country. \n \n11.  Justification for a transaction TA facility. The preparation of the two projects require a \nsimilar  set  of  due  diligence,  including  safeguards,  financial  management,  and  economic \nassessments. The transaction TA facility is not listed in the current Country Operations Business \nPlan, but has been agreed during the railway subsector consultation mission of 1\u201312 July 2019 \nas confirmed through an aide memoire signed by the government. \n \n12.  Each of the ensuing projects are considered low risk, because (i) the amount of ADB \nfinancial assistance for each project does not exceed $200 million, (ii) the track record by the \nexecuting agency (EA) in the implementation of ADB-financed projects is sound as proven \nthrough ongoing projects, (iii) no integrity concerns are foreseen, (iv) climate risks are low to \nmedium, (v) safeguard category is at most B for environment, B for resettlement and C for \nindigenous peoples for both projects, (vi) there are no exceptions to ADB\u2019s policies envisaged, (v) \nhigh-level technology will be introduced to the extent that they are proven by the market. \n \n13.  Key expenditure items envisaged under the ensuing projects include (i) goods and plant \nfor  electrification  of  railway  lines  (ii)  material  for  external  power  supply,  (iii)  signaling  and \ntelecommunications equipment, (iv) specialized machinery and equipment for track maintenance, \nand (v) project management and construction supervision consultants.  \n \nB.

Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $660,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items \nare  listed  in  Appendix  1.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The government was \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will administer the TA facility through its Central and West Asia Department\u2019s \nTransport and Communication Division, which will select, supervise and evaluate consultants. \nThe consultants will be attached to the Project Implementation Unit for Electrification and Renewal \nof Rolling Stock (PIU-ET) within UTY. The consultants will work with the PIU-ET to prepare the \n ", "5 \nensuing projects. Detailed design, for those project components which require them, will be \nconducted by the government\u2019s design institute. TRTA consultants will help check and improve \nsuch designs as required. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  August 2019\u2013December 2021 \nExecuting agency  O\u2019zbekiston Temir Yo\u2019llari \nImplementing agency  Central and West Asia Department, ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Individual: individual  International, 23  $575,900 \n  selection or as resource  person-months, and \n  persons  National, 11 person-\n  months \nProcurement  To be procured by consultants  \n  Request for Quotations  2 contracts  $10,000 \nAdvance contracting  To expedite the conduct of the TA, selection of key individual consultant \npositions will commence through advance contracting following PAI 2.04. \nNegotiation and signing of the consulting contract will only occur after the TA \nbecomes effective. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Any equipment or software purchased under the TA will be handed over to \narrangement upon TA completion  the Executing Agency upon TA completion. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, PAI = Project Administration Instructions, \nTA = technical assistance, TRTA = transaction technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n17.  Consulting services. The transaction TA facility will require approximately 23 person-\nmonths (PMs) of international consultants and 11 PMs of national consultants\u2019 inputs. This \nincludes 1 PM of national, and 1 PM international resource person inputs to provide short-term, \nhighly specialized inputs. Consultants will support ADB staff in the conduct of standard due \ndiligence on the proposed projects, including technical, economic and financial, governance, \npoverty and social (including gender), safeguards and strategic procurement planning. They will \nalso provide capacity building to the EA on procurement, safeguards and gender. Consultants \nand resource persons will be recruited individually, with either input-based or output-based \ncontracts as appropriate. For project due diligence in a highly specialized subsector such as \nrailways, hiring individual consultants, rather than firms, is faster to mobilize, and more cost-\neffective. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and its associated TA staff instructions.11 Apart from work on common \ndue diligence and capacity building (outputs 1 and 4 in Table 1), the consultants will be sent \nseparate notices-to-proceed for preparatory work on each of the two projects, following the \napproval of each project\u2019s concept paper. The consultants will procure goods, mainly in the form \nof software to be used for noise and environmental modeling and monitoring, and railway traffic \nmodeling. These will be handed over to the EA upon TA completion. \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.
