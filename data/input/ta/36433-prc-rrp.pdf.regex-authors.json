An environmental impact assessment was completed and \nAssessment  the summary was circulated to the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADBs) \nBoard of Directors on 15 February 2006. \n   \nProject Description  The Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway (TZR) Project (the Project) is located in \nthe central part of Shanxi province and the northwestern part of Shaanxi \nand Ningxia province\u2014a relatively poor area. The Project is designed to \npromote sustainable economic growth by constructing 944 kilometers \n(km) of railway line from Taiyuan in Shanxi to Zhongwei and Yinchuan in \nNingxia. The Project will (i) develop an efficient, safe, affordable, and \nenvironmentally sustainable railway transport system in the region; and \n(ii)  facilitate  the  creation  of  additional  employment  and  income-\ngenerating opportunities, thus benefiting poor residents.  \n   \nRationale  The Project reflects ADB\u2019s railway sector operational strategy for the \nPRC,  which  includes  reducing  railway  network  constraints  and \npromoting sustainable economic growth in poor areas not served by \nrailways.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  western \ndevelopment  strategy  to  provide  less  developed  regions  with  better \ninfrastructure  to  facilitate  economic  growth,  thereby  increasing  the \nopportunity for people to improve their living standards.  \n \nThe  interior  regions  of  the  PRC  have  not  benefited  as  much  from \neconomic  growth  and  reforms  as  the  east  coast;  in  fact,  the  gap \nbetween economic and social development has increased. Transport \nconstraints  and  high  logistics  costs  are  two  factors  contributing  to \nregional economic disparities, and two of the constraints preventing the \nwestern region from capitalizing on its comparative advantages. \n \nThe Project is (i) the first east\u2013west railway line linking Shanxi, Shaanxi, \nand Ningxia provinces; and (ii) the shortest east\u2013west corridor linking \nBeijing, Huanghua, Qingdao, and other major cities and ports in the east \nto Yinchuan, Zhongwei, Lanzhou, and Urumqui in the west on its way to \nKazakhstan. The proposed alignment for the TZR is 100\u2013500 km shorter \nthan the existing route passing through the Longhai and Baolan railway \nlines. Traversing Shanxi, Shaanxi Provinces, and Ningxia Autonomous \nRegion,  the  proposed  railway  line  will  connect  with  the  Beijing\u2013\nShenzhen, Qingdao\u2013Shijiazhuang, Qinhuangdao\u2013Tianjin main lines in \nthe  east;  and  Baotou\u2013Wuhai\u2013Lanzhou,  Baotou\u2013Suide\u2013Xi\u2019an,  and \nUrumqui\u2013Wuwei\u2013Zhongwei, main lines in the west. The Project will also \nhelp to promote regional cooperation, as this is the shortest east\u2013west \ncorridor linking the PRC to Europe. \n   \n  The Project\u2014a joint venture railway between the Ministry of Railways \n ", "ii   \n(MOR) and Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provincial governments (SPG, \nSAPG,  NHAR)\u2014will  have  substantial  managerial  and  financial \nautonomy. The Project will contribute to changing railway enterprises \nfrom  cost  centers  in  a  planned  economy  to  profit  centers  in  an \nincreasingly  competitive  transport  market.  The  components  are \nformulated in line with MOR\u2019s 2004 railway development plan. \n   \nImpact and  The Project will remove a transport constraint to sustainable economic \nOutcome  growth. Providing economic railway transportation in the unserved, less-\ndeveloped, and poor areas will help create the conditions necessary for \ndeveloping local resources and generating employment and income-\nenhancing opportunities to raise living standards in the project area.  \n \nProject  preparation  involved  participatory  processes.  Extensive \nconsultations were held with all the main stakeholders, including various \naffected people, potential beneficiaries, village leaders, women\u2019s groups, \nlocal  ethnic  bureaus,  and  local  governments  in  the  project  area. \nHousehold surveys were carried out, and participatory workshops were \norganized in the project area to understand public opinion about the \nProject  and  provide  inputs  for  the  social  and  environmental \nassessments. \n \nThe  Project  comprises  the  following  components:  (i)  construction  of \n520 km double track electrified standard gauge Class I railway from \nTaiyuan to Dingbian, 232 km electrified single track from Dingbian to \nZhongwei,  and  192  km  electrified  single  track  from  Dingbian  to \nYinchuan;  (ii)  construction  of  41  new  railway  stations  complete  with \nfacilities; (iii) safety initiatives, including provision of modern technology \nand equipment for enhancing safety; (iv) signaling, e-governance and \nmanagement information system; (v) provision of training on the use and \nmaintenance  of  modern  equipment;  (vi)  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement; (vii) environmental protection and mitigation of adverse \nenvironmental  effects;  (viii)  consulting  services  for  construction \nsupervision,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment; and (ix) strengthening of institutional capabilities. The key \ninputs needed for project implementation include civil works, equipment, \nconsultants, and staff of MOR and the Project Company.  \n   \nProject Investment  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $3.753 billion.  \nPlan \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 26-year term including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 31 December 2012 \nUtilization   \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Railways \n ", "  iii \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 6 years. The Foreign Capital and \nArrangements  Technical  Import  Center,  under  MOR,  will  coordinate  the  project \nmanagement  office's  tasks  and  be  responsible  for  procurement, \nwithdrawals, and reporting to ADB. The Project Company will be the \nimplementing agency and manage and operate the project railway; and \ndevelop  and  implement  adequate  and  transparent  business \ndevelopment mechanisms, and accounting and reporting systems.  \n   \nProcurement  MOR will procure ADB-financed components in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. Other items will be procured in accordance \nwith government procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n   \nConsulting  The ADB loan will finance 10 person-months of international consulting \nServices  services  for  strengthening  the  institutional,  marketing,  and  business \ndevelopment  functions  of  the  Project  Company.  Consultants  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. MOR will engage and finance domestic consulting services \nfor project design, construction supervision, construction quality control, \nenvironmental supervision, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation \nof the safeguard aspects of the Project in accordance with government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nProject Benefits  The Project will (i) provide the shortest land route between Taiyuan, \nand Beneficiaries  Yulin,  Zhongwei,  and  Yinchuan\u2014key  economic  centers  of  Shanxi, \nShaanxi, and Ningixia provinces\u2014enabling railway users to benefit from \nlower transport costs and shorter travel distances and times; (ii) increase \nthe corridor\u2019s capacity, benefiting consumers and producers of goods \nand  services  through  the  provision  of  timely  and  efficient  transport \nservices  and  lower  logistics  costs;  (iii) generate  direct  and  indirect \nemployment in the project-influenced area, and create jobs and income-\nearning opportunities (the construction and operation of the railway will \nemploy  much  local  unskilled  labor);  (iv) provide  an  area  that  lacked \nadequate cost-efficient transportation services with access to broader \nmarkets; and (v) stimulate local development through small business \nopportunities,  tourism,  railway  station  area  development,  and  other \ninfrastructure elements to maximize benefits to local areas.  \nThe major project beneficiaries will be (i) passengers, including tourists, \nwho will benefit from affordable, faster, and safer trips; (ii) freight users \nwho will switch from the existing road and benefit from more affordable, \nfaster, and safer trips; (iii) local residents who will benefit from the lower \nprices of commodities and services transported by the project railway; \n(iv) local labor involved in construction work and supply of materials \nduring  implementation,  and  loading/unloading  during  the  railway\u2019s \noperation; (v) local farmers who will be able to sell their products at \nmarket prices without paying a high margin to a transport intermediary; \n(vi) manufacturers and traders who can increase production capacity or \nestablish businesses, and will transport their goods and services by the \nrailway;  and  (vii) local  governments,  which  will  benefit  from  the \nincreased  opportunity  for  local  area  development  and  increased \nrevenues. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 6.5 million people living in the project area. \nThe poverty and social assessment looked at the 22 counties/districts, of \n ", "iv   \nwhich 20 are rural and 2 urban. Eleven counties are designated national \nor provincial poverty counties. The 1,527 designated poverty villages \nhave a population of about 1 million poor. About 70% of the beneficiaries \nlive in rural areas, and 21.5% are poor with an annual net income per \ncapita  of  less  than  CNY900.  The  links  between  poverty,  difficult \ntopography, and poor transport systems are apparent in the project area \nfor  the  proposed  TZR.  Poverty  is  often  caused  by  geographic \nremoteness and isolation, limited transport access, high transport costs, \nand poor access to market information, as well as limited access to \nhealth, education, and other social services. \n   \n  The  Project  will  facilitate  the  creation  of  additional  employment  and \nincome-generating opportunities. About 453,000 person-years of work \nwill be created during construction. This will provide direct employment \nopportunities to over 217,500 poor people, including women and ethnic \nminorities. Railway station area development will increase incomes in \nlocal communities and help generate local revenues. The Project will \nfacilitate  the  development  of  small  businesses,  local  industry,  and \ntourism, which will help generate additional opportunities in the future for \nlocal  people.  Consultations  with  local  people  in  the  project  area \nindicated their strong support for the Project. \nThe  Project  is  financially  and  economically  sustainable.  The  8.4% \nfinancial internal rate of return exceeds the 2.2% weighted average cost \nof capital. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 18.2%.  \n \nThe increased tax revenues generated by the economic development \ninduced by the Project will help finance improved social service facilities \nand basic infrastructure. \n   \nRisks and  The railway will be constructed in mountainous and desert areas, which \nAssumptions  is a significant technical challenge. The associated physical risks during \n  implementation include delays, cost overruns, worker health and safety, \n  and environmental impacts. These potential risks have been assessed \n  and mitigating measures have been provided based on lessons learned \n  from other railroad projects in the PRC.  \n   \n  Resettlement will cause relocation of about 12,000 people. The railway \n  alignment was selected to minimize resettlement, where possible. The \nresettlement plan includes preferential treatment for employment during \nconstruction, supply of local materials, allocation of commercial space \nnear railway stations, and job training. Resettlement will be implemented \nby  local  governments  and  closely  monitored  and  supervised.  These \nmeasures  will  mitigate  the  potential  social  risks  associated  with \nresettlement. \n \nIntermodal competition between railways and roads will create market \nrisks  for  the  project  railway.  However,  the  existing  road  is  already \ncongested and the capacity constraint is expected to worsen. Surveys of \npassengers  and  freight  shippers  found  that  the  railway  would  have \nseveral advantages over other transport modes: lower fares, shorter \ntravel  times,  safety,  and  punctuality.  The  increasing  commercial \norientation of the joint venture railway will help to lessen the risks posed \nby intermodal competition. \n ", "90 o 00'E 110o  00'E\nSiping\nTAIYUAN--ZHONGWEI RAILWAY PROJECT\nIN THE Tieling\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Shenyang\nBenxi\nLIAONING\nNanfen\nMONGOLIA Jingzhou Dandong\nYingkou 40 o 00'N\nZhangjiakou Shanhaiguan\nJining\nINNER  MONGOLIA\nBohai\nHohhot Datong BEIJING Tangshan Sea Dalian\nTIANJIN\nBazhou Tianjin\nZhuange'er Shuoxian\nHuanghua\n40 o 00'N Dongsheng Shuazhou HEBEI Yantai\nTo Urumqi Shenmu North Yuanping Hengshui\nYumen Yinchuan Taiyuan Shijiazhuang Dezhou\nLiulin Shuyang Qingdao\nSHANDONG\nShehe Jinan\nShijiusuo\nNational Capital Zhongwei Dingbian Suide Xiaoyi Xinxian FengtenYganzhou Yellow  Sea  \nProvincial Capital NINGXIA Mucun SHANXI Linyi 30 o 00'N\nGantang\nCity/Town Yan'an North Linfen Jiaozuo Xin Xiang Heze Lianyungang\nExisting Railway Yueshan Jiahezhai Xinyl\nZhengzhou\nProject Railway Hancheng Houma Shangqiu Suixi Xuzhou Huaiyin Dafeng\nPlanned Railway Lanzhou Luoyang Suxian\nRailway Under Construction Sanyuan Tongguan Baofeng XuchanZghoukouzhen Bengbu Hai'an Nantong\nAPsroiavnin Dcieavl eBlooupnmdeanrty Bank - Financed Project Baoji Xingping Xi'Xaninfeng HENAN Luohe Fuyang Huainan JIANGSU SHANGHAI\nHuxian\n30 o 00'N International Boundary GANSU SHAANXI Nanyang Huangzhou Hefei Nanjing Shanghai\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway (TZR) Project. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n2.  From 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, through to 2005, \nthe  PRC  has  experienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth,  which  has  resulted  in  an \naccordingly  rapid  increase  in  demand  for  transportation.  The  annual  growth  of  passenger \ntransport was 9% and freight transport grew at 7.6% during the 1978\u20132004 period. In 2005, \nroad traffic accounted for 53.2% of total passenger-kilometers (km), followed by railways with \n34.7%, civil aviation with 11.7%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. The modal split \nfor freight ton-km was 61.3% for coastal and inland waterways, 26.5% for railways, 11.0% for \nroads, 1.1% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \n3.  The railway is the primary mode of transport for long distance and bulk transport. At the \nend of 2005, the PRC\u2019s railway system of 75,438 route-kms comprised 62,200 km of national \nrailways and 13,238 km of joint venture and local railways. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) \noperates the state-owned national railway as an integrated system. The joint venture and local \nrailways,  comprising  regional  lines  within  provincial  boundaries,  are  constructed  under  the \nsponsorship  of  provincial  governments  and/or  MOR  to  serve  local  needs  and  provide \ninterconnection to the national railway network. Despite its large size, the railway network does \nnot provide adequate coverage for the country\u2019s population and land area.1  \n \n4.  PRC railways have the highest freight transport density in the world and second highest \npassenger  transport  density  after  Japan.  Locomotive  turnover  is  the  highest  in  the  world. \nBetween 1978 and 2005, railway freight increased from 535 billion ton-km to 2,073 billion ton-\nkm, equivalent to an annual growth rate of 5.1%. Passenger traffic grew at 6.6% annually from \n109 billion passenger-km to 606 billion passenger-km. The average railway journey increased \nfrom 134 km in 1978 to 527 km in 2005, compared with the average journey per passenger by \nroad, which grew from 35 km to 54 km over the same period. Despite such growth rates, railway \ncapacity  has  lagged  behind  demand  because  of  system  constraints.  Given  the  railways\u2019 \nimportant  role  in  providing  economic  transportation,  these  constraints,  if  not  removed,  will \ncontinue to be among the major constraints to efficient economic growth. The Government\u2019s \naggressive  plan  to  improve  railways  includes  network  expansion  and  construction  in \nunderserved areas. \n   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Government Strategy  \n5.  The Government's policy on railway development focuses on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint venture local railways to \npromote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety of the \nexisting  system  by  using  new  technology  and  modern  management  tools  in  planning  and \noperation, (iv) reducing operating subsidies through appropriate pricing and commercialization \nof  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  autonomy  and \naccountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure and related \nservices.  \n                                                 \n1 The network density per 1,000 square km of land is one third that of India and one tenth that of Japan. \n ", "2   \n \n6.  The  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identified  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. The plan envisaged (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide \naccess  to  unserved  areas,  with  the  network  length  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km; \n(ii) providing  3,000  km  of  double  lines  and  electrifying  5,000  km  of  key  lines  to  increase \ncapacity; and (iii) increasing operating speeds on 5,000 km, with the total length of such lines \nreaching 15,000 km. A total investment of CNY350 billion was planned, including CNY270 \nbillion for capital construction and CNY80 billion for rolling stock. By the end of 2005, a total \ninvestment of CNY308 billion for capital construction was made for constructing 6,458 km of \nnew lines, providing 3,275 km of double lines and electrifying 6,259 km of tracks. During 2003\u2013\n2007, the investments for capital construction are expected to reach CNY450 billion. The 11th \nFive  Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010),  which  is  under  preparation,  continues  to  emphasize  railway \ndevelopment (Appendix 3). \n \n7.  In 2004, the State Council approved the railway development plan, which (i) seeks to \nexpand the railway network to 85,000 km by 2010 and 100,000 km by 2020; and (ii) identifies \nthe need for separate passenger- and freight-dedicated lines on busy trunk routes. The route \nnetwork length of the passenger-dedicated network will reach 5,000 km by 2010 and 12,000 km \nby 2020. Increasing train speed to enhance mobility is a major goal: by 2020, train speed will \nincrease to over 200 km per hour on the trunk network from the present 120 km per hour. \nPriority will be given to developing railways in unserved areas, and regions that lack transport \nand remain less developed. The route network length will increase by 16,000 km in the western \nregion of the PRC to reach a network length of 40,000 km by 2020. \n \n2.  Asian Development Bank Strategy and Sector Experience \n8.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for the railway sector focuses on helping \n(i) expand the railway system by constructing new lines in unserved, less-developed areas; \n(ii) modernize and increase capacity to improve efficiency on key routes of the national railway \nsystem; (iii) commercialize railway operations to sustain efficient operations; and (iv) increase \nrailway competitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform. ADB has \nfocused on the development of railways in poor, less-developed inland provinces to promote \nsustainable economic growth and reduce poverty.2 ADB has provided 13 loans totaling about \n$2.6 billion to finance the construction of about 1,921 km of eight provincial railways operated by \njoint ventures with MOR, and 4,597 km of new railway lines under the five national railway \nprojects (Appendix 4). The Project, designed to promote economic growth by providing railway \ntransportation in unserved, less-developed, and poor areas of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Ningxia \nprovinces, is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and the ADB strategy. \n \n3.  Policy Dialogue  \n9.  Policy dialogue has been a feature of ADB assistance to the railway sector and has \neffectively complemented the lending operations. Since 1989, 11 technical assistance (TA) \ninitiatives totaling $5.0 million have been provided for institutional development of local railways, \ntariff  and  organizational  studies  for  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway,  enhancement  of  commercial  and \nbusiness operations, marketing and business development, human resource development, and \nimprovement  of  financial  management  and  accounting  systems  (Appendix  4).  ADB  policy \ndialogue  with  MOR  focuses  on  (i)  poverty  reduction  as  the  overarching  objective  of  ADB \noperations, (ii) full compliance with ADB safeguard policies, (iii) sector reforms, (iv) marketing \nand business development, (v) private sector participation and nongovernmental financing, and \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000.

The findings conclude that completed railway projects supported general economic growth in \nthe region and led to small areas of high economic growth in towns served by railway stations. \n ", "  3 \n(vi) regional cooperation. The railway development plan defines the major goals for the PRC \nrailways to 2020, and is in broad agreement with ADB\u2019s strategic agenda. MOR\u2019s proposed \nreform agenda for this plan seeks to (i) study and learn from the best international practices \ngained  worldwide,  (ii)  separate  core  operations  from  noncore  transportation  businesses, \n(iii) rationalize and reduce staff, (iv) reform the railway investment and financing system, and \n(v) establish specialized transportation companies.  \n \n10.  MOR  has  adopted  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  using  a  new \nmanagement concept\u2014the asset operating liability system\u2014MOR entered into management \ncontracts with railway administrations to improve profitability (as a pilot project). The contracts \nhelped  improve  operational  and  financial  performance;  this  approach  was  subsequently \nextended to all 15 railway administrations. Separation of core and noncore businesses is a key \nelement  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation business was reduced from 1.89 million in 1997 to 1.41 million in 2005. In the \nnoncore  transportation business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested. To provide jobs for redundant staff, by the end of 2005 MOR had set up 5,076 \ndiversified businesses (independent of the core transportation business) employing more than \n370,000 staff to supply equipment, goods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, MOR \ninitiated a cost-sharing scheme for health insurance and pensions for railway employees. In \n2005, MOR completed the transfer of 822 primary and middle schools, 46 vocational schools, \nand 181 nursery schools; and 260 hospitals and medical units to local governments. One \nhundred branch lines comprising 7,800 km were separated to improve productivity and reduce \noperating losses. (The reform agenda matrix is in Appendix 5. Supplementary Appendix A \nincludes a chronology of railway reforms.) \n \na.  Poverty Reduction \n11.  The  strategic  purpose  of  ADB  involvement  in  the  railway  sector  is  to  create  the \nconditions  for  sustainable  economic  growth  to  help  improve  living  standards.  The  Project, \nlocated in an unserved area, has the potential for economic growth once improved, cost-\neffective transport access is provided. Identifying ways to enhance the poverty reduction impact \nhas been an integral part of project planning and design. Specific features include (i) providing \nemployment during construction and operation of the TZR on a preferential basis to poor \nworkers, including women;3 (ii) utilizing locally produced materials that meet the requirements of \nquality and economy (e.g., sand, stone, cement); (iii) adding provisions for railway station area \ndevelopment;  (iv)  providing  station  access  roads  and  construction  access  roads;  and \n(v) supporting  poverty  reduction  programs  of  local  governments.4 The  Project  will  finance \nconstruction  access  roads  to  be  handed  over  to  the  local  government  at  the  end  of  the \nconstruction. Local governments have a 5-year plan to improve the road network and transport \nservices in the project area concurrently with the Project. These roads will reach all of the \nprovince-designated poverty villages. The Project and the local road development will increase \nthe welfare gains for the poor, including women, and help spread project benefits to the poverty \nvillages. \n \n                                                 \n3  In the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project, the proportion of the poor in unskilled labor was 41% on average and 64% \nduring peak construction.

Manila.  \n4  Some completed projects reported that about 40% of the poor at appraisal were raised above the poverty line upon \nproject completion e.g. in the case of the Hefei\u2013Jiujiang Railway Project 41% of the poor were raised above the \npoverty line.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nb.  Sector Reforms \n12.  ADB is supporting institutional reform of the railway sector to separate government and \nenterprise functions, giving full play to market forces and increasing the competitiveness of the \nrailways. ADB has actively pursued (i) separation of the core transport business from the \nnoncore  transport  business,  (ii)  segmentation  of  passenger  and  freight  services,  and \n(iii) strengthening of the recently corporatized specialized transportation companies. As part of \nADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR, three large companies handling containers, special goods, \nand  express  parcel  have  been  set  up.5 Setting  up  passenger-dedicated  corridors  with  a \nseparate institutional structure is a key ADB intervention.6 ADB is assisting in developing the \ninstitutional, marketing, business development, and technical standards for such initiatives.  \n \n13.  Rationalization of staff and reduction of transportation and non-transportation staff is \nalso being pursued. On 18 March 2005, under a major restructuring exercise, MOR abolished \n41 subrailway administration bureaus, thereby reducing one tier of railway management. The \nnumber of stations and sections were reduced from 1,500 to 894, and the number of railway \nadministrations  increased  from  15  to  18.  This  has  helped  reduce  20,000  staff,  rationalize \noperations,  improve  productivity,  and  enhance  efficiency.  Recent  ADB  interventions  have \nsupported operational reforms and emphasized railway safety\u2014including the introduction of \nsafe and reliable technology, upgrading speeds, introducing dedicated passenger and freight \nlines, modern dispatch control system, and high quality information systems on the PRC railway \nnetwork. The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization has intensified competition \namong different modes of transport and the structure of transport demand is likely to change.7 \nADB is providing an advisory TA for policy reform support to MOR,8 which will look at the \nconflicting roles of meeting social obligations and making profits, increasing modal competition, \nimpacts caused by the fast pace of urbanization and economic development, and demand for \ndelivery of improved services. During project processing, coordination was maintained with the \nWorld Bank and a common approach to reforms and assistance was developed. This will be \ncontinued during project implementation. \n \nc.  Marketing and Business Development  \n14.  As the PRC progresses to a market-driven economy, railways will need to compete on \nthe basis of price and service quality for demand-based transportation services. New marketing \nand business development initiatives are needed for freight and passenger services to be \ncompetitive. In past projects, ADB has supported project-specific studies to create marketing \nand business development opportunities, including skills and knowledge for market-oriented \noperation and awareness of profitable operations. The Project will continue these initiatives \nthrough a capacity development program for the Project Company. \n \n                                                 \n5  These companies are China Railway Container Transport Company, China Railway Express Parcel Company, and \nChina Railway Special Goods Company. The startup process is ongoing. ADB and MOR have agreed on the \nseparation of container businesses as part of the ADB-financed Yichang\u2013Wanzhou Railway Project.

ADB\u2019s policy dialogue encourages increased private sector participation in the railway \nsector. ADB is assisting MOR with a study to examine opportunities for diversified financing \nsources, increased private sector involvement, and the possibility of public private partnerships \nin the PRC railways sector. In 2005, MOR issued guidelines on facilitating the investment and \nfinancing system reforms, which seek to reduce the threshold of the investment, encourage the \nprivate sector to invest, and welcome strategic investor in railway financing.9  Under the Project, \na preparatory group has been established to look at the possibility of diversified financing \nsources, including the private sector.10 Three strategic investors11 have expressed interest in \nparticipating in the project equity. This will be followed up during project implementation. A \ncorporate entity will be set up to construct, operate, and manage the Project. The Project \nCompany will outsource activities such as consulting services for construction supervision, \ntesting,  construction  contracts,  track  maintenance,  commercial  activities,  industrial  sidings, \nloading and unloading, and other logistical facilities by open competition; and encourage private \nsector involvement in the development of station facilities, local tourism, and real estate. Extra \nlarge container terminals at Qingdao, Lanzhou, and Taiyuan will be established to facilitate \nparticipation  of  shipping  lines  and  freight  forwarders  in  the  business  of  rail  transported \ncontainers. All of these actions will enhance opportunities for private sector participation. \n \n4.  Lessons  \n16.  Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC \nshows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of executing agencies for \nproject implementation (Appendix 6). The speed of implementation has generally exceeded \nexpectations  at  appraisal,  and  agencies  have  generally  complied  with  loan  covenants. \nResettlement and environmental management were carried out satisfactorily. Audit covenants \nwere complied with in a timely manner, and the audited financial statements were generally \nacceptable. Of the 13 ADB-supported railway projects, 8 have been completed,12 2 have started \ncommercial operations,13 and 3 are under implementation.14 \n                                                 \n9  China National Oil Petroleum Company is financing CNY1.7 billion for Beijing\u2013Tianjin intercity railway line, whose \nconstruction started in July 2005. \n10 Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen joint venture railway company is listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange and New York Stock \nExchange. \n11 China Communication Construction Engineering Group, Beijing; China Engineering Construction Group, Beijing; \nand Shaanxi Province Hualong Energy Limited Liability Company, Xi\u2019an. \n12 ADB. 1989.

The key lessons from the completed railway projects highlight the need to (i) ensure that \nthe executing agency established for project processing, implementation, and operation has \nadequate capacity; (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts; (iii) review constraints to traffic on a \nnetwork basis, and the impact on project viability of the existing and/or planned railway lines and \nother transportation modes that may compete with project facilities; (iv) realistic resettlement \nprojections at appraisal; and (v) finance railway projects with appropriately determined debt-\nequity ratios.  \n \n18.  Previous  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  socioeconomic  development  in  the \nprojects'  influence  areas.  The  main  impacts  are  as  follows:  (i)  new  railway  lines  in  less-\ndeveloped regions stimulated economic development, resulting in higher growth rates of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and rural incomes compared with the \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario;15 \n(ii) construction  activities  generated  demand  for  unskilled  labor  and  employment  of  poor \nworkers,  including  women,  who  would  have  otherwise  remained  unemployed  or \nunderemployed;16 (iii) service roads built for construction activities opened up and benefited \nrural communities in inaccessible areas; (iv) domestic resource mobilization improved, providing \nadditional  resources  for  social  programs 17  and  generating  employment;  (v)  supply  and \ntransportation of local materials generated employment; (vi) improved and lower cost transport \nresulted in lower prices of agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers), which stimulated cash-crop \nfarming and provided more income to farmers; increased the mobility of rural residents; and \nallowed access to more markets, employment opportunities, and social services beyond the \nimmediate communities; (vii) counties provided with new railway access recorded higher GDP \ngrowth rates than other counties; (viii) the investment environment was enhanced, resulting in \nrapid development of secondary and tertiary industries that generated employment;18 (ix) the \nconsequent shift in the structure of employment from low productivity agriculture to higher \nproductivity agroprocessing and light industry increased employment opportunities for women \nwhose incomes and social status then improved;19 (x) tourism developed because of more \naffordable  and  convenient  railway  travel;  and  (xi)  environmental  protection  and  mitigation \nmeasures were taken under the projects as agreed at appraisal, and the environmental impacts \n____________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Ganzhou\u2013Longyan Railway Project.

Rural income per capita in Xinfeng county increased from CNY802 in 1993 to CNY2,222 in \n1998, an annual increase of 18.5% compared with 10.3% during 1985\u20131992 (before the Project). \n16 During the first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway (footnote 10), a total of about 7.5 million \nperson-days of employment was generated, of which 4.1 million person-days or about 55% were provided to local \npoor people thereby raising them above the poverty line. \n17 The financial revenue of 10 poverty counties in Jiangxi province that are traversed by the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway \n(footnote 11) increased from CNY0.5 billion in 1993 to CNY1.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 22.7% \ncompared with 12.3% during 1985\u20131992, before construction of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway. \n18 The Jing\u2013Jiu Railway facilitated setting up many resource- and agriculture-based industries in Xingfeng county of \nJiangxi province\u2014from 3 in 1992 to 39 in 1998, after project completion. The number of businesses grew from \n8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons employed in these businesses increased from 18,484 \nin 1992 to 52,153 in 1998\u2014an annual increase of 23%. In the same county, the number of people living below the \npoverty line was reduced from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998, a decline of 62%. \n19 Beneficial income and social impacts, particularly on women, were noted in the influence areas of the Yaogu\u2013\nMaoming Railway (footnote 11) and Guang\u2013Mei-Shan Railway (footnote 11). \n ", "  7 \nof  induced  developments  were  addressed  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  impact \nassessments (EIAs) for the projects. The railway projects have contributed to a transformation \nof  the  local  economies:  per  capita  rural  incomes  increased  substantially,  living  standards \nimproved, and poverty reduced. The lessons learned and experience gained are incorporated in \nthe current project design.  \n \n5.  Rationale \n19.  The  project  rationale  reflects  (i)  network  development;  (ii)  capacity  enhancement; \n(iii) support  for  the  PRC  railway  development  plan  and  the  western  region  development \nstrategy; and (iv) promotion of pro-poor economic growth along the railway line and in the \nregion, thereby reducing poverty. The project area is largely mountainous and desert with \nabundant natural reserves of coal, and other nonferrous materials; and a large manufacturing \nindustry  and  tourist sites.  In  spite  of  abundant  natural  resources, many  are  poor  and  the \neconomic growth necessary to reduce rural poverty has failed to develop because of inadequate \ntransport services and high costs. Local governments and people living in the project area see \nthe railway as a key investment for addressing this problem. \n \n20.  There is no east\u2013west railway line linking Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provinces. The \nproposed  project  is  the  shortest  east\u2013west  corridor  linking  Beijing,  Qingdao,  Hunaghua, \nQinhuangdao, Taiyuan, and other major cities and ports in the east to Yinchuan, Zhongwei, \nLanzhou, and Urumqui in the west on its way to Kazakhstan. The proposed alignment for the \nTZR is 100\u2013500 km shorter than the existing route passing through the Longhai and Baolan \nrailway lines. Traversing Shanxi and Shaanxi Provinces, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region \n(NHAR), the proposed railway line will connect with Beijing\u2013Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen, Qingdao\u2013\nShijiazhuang\u2013Taiyuan, Taiyuan\u2013Zhengzhou, Huanghua\u2013Shijiazhuang\u2013Taiyuan, Qinhuangdao\u2013\nTianjin\u2013Cangzhou\u2013Shijiazhuang\u2013Taiyuan  main  lines  in  the  east;  Shenmu\u2013Yan\u2019an20 in  the \ncenter;  and  Baotou\u2013Wuhai\u2013Lanzhou,  Baotou\u2013Suide\u2013Xi\u2019an,  Urumqui\u2013Wuwei\u2013Zhongwei,  and \nXi\u2019an\u2013Yan\u2019an  main  lines  in  the  west.  The  proposed  line  extends  eastward  to  Shijizhuang, \nconnecting  with  Jing\u2013Guang,  to  Hengshui,  connecting  with  Jing\u2013Jiu, 21  and  to  Dezhou \nconnecting with the Jing\u2013Hu route; westward to Wuwei and Lanzhou, connecting with the Jing\u2013\nLan routes and Lan\u2013Xin line; northward to Wuhai, connecting with Baotou on Jing\u2013Bao line; and \nsouthward to Baoji and Xi\u2019an, connecting with Longhai line. The Project will also help promote \nregional cooperation as this is the shortest east\u2013west corridor linking the PRC to Europe. \n \n21.  The  Project  and  associated  developments  are  expected  to  stimulate  industrial  and \nnatural resources development, tourism and related industries, increase the mobility and flow of \ninformation  exchanges,  generate  employment,  increase  living  standards,  and  help  reduce \npoverty. The Project is part of the Government's program to integrate the development of \ntransportation  facilities,  upgrade  highways,  and  construct  links  and  access  roads  to  the \nhinterland. Other infrastructure, such as water supply and investment to improve education and \nhealth care facilities, are also planned. The railway will play an important role in facilitating and \nintegrating this poor and underdeveloped region in the PRC and neighboring countries.  \n \n22.  The Project will be a joint venture railway owned and operated by MOR and the Shanxi, \nShaanxi,  and  Ningxia  provincial  governments.  Joint  venture  railways,  which  account  for \n8,500 km (2004) of the PRC system, have substantial managerial and financial autonomy, \nincluding the freedom to set tariffs, which are several times higher than those of the national \nnetwork. Freight and passenger traffic on joint venture railways has grown faster than on \nnational railways. Between 1996 and 2005, passenger traffic grew from 2.2 billon passenger-km \n                                                 \n20  ADB provided $200 million for Loan 1553-PRC: Shenmu\u2013Yan\u2019an Railway Project (footnote 11). \n21  ADB provided $200 million for Loan 1305-PRC: Jing\u2013Jiu Railway Technical Enhancement Project (footnote 11). \n ", "8   \nto 22.5 billion (29.5%), and freight rose from 12.3 billion ton-km to 109.3 billion ton-km (27.5%) \nannually, compared with an annual growth rate of 6.8% for passengers and 4.9% for freight on \nthe national railway network. Joint venture railways are more efficient, employing only 8\u201310 \npeople  per  km  compared  with  about  25  people  per  km  for  national  railways.  The  Project \nCompany will employ 8\u201310 people per km. \n \n23.  The Project is a key intervention in the railway sector with many technical, operational, \nsafety, economic, and financial benefits. MOR has agreed that a corporate entity will be set up \nto construct, operate, and manage the Project; and that it will help enhance the financial viability \nand private sector participation. ADB is assisting in the institutional, marketing, and business \ndevelopment for the Project Company. The tariffs agreed are affordable and financially viable. \nThe  Project  will  bring  in  new  technology  and  pursue  operational  reforms,  including  the \nintroduction of safe and reliable technology, increase of speeds, and introduction of modern \ndispatch control systems and high quality information systems on the railway network. When \ncomplete, the Project will provide a shorter link to the west, release capacity on the existing \nrailway  lines,  and  provide  for  an  efficient,  high-quality,  safe,  reliable,  and  environmentally \nfriendly mode of transport in the region.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n24.  By removing a transport constraint to sustainable economic growth, the Project will help \nincrease standards of living and reduce poverty in the project area. This will be achieved by \nproviding efficient, affordable railway transportation in unserved, less developed areas to create \nthe  conditions  necessary  for  developing  local  resources  and  generating  employment  and \nincome-enhancing opportunities. \n \nB.  Outputs \n25.  The Project comprises (i) construction of 520 km double track electrified standard gauge \nClass  I  railway  from  Taiyuan  to  Dingbian,  232  km  electrified  single  track  from  Dingbian-\nZhongwei, and 192 km electrified single track from Dingbian to Yinchuan;22 (ii) construction of \n41 new railway stations complete with facilities; (iii) safety initiatives, including provision of \nmodern  technology  and  equipment  for  enhancing  safety;  (iv)  signaling,  e-governance  and \nmanagement  information  system;  (v)  provision  of  training  on  the  use  and  maintenance  of \nmodern equipment; (vi) land acquisition and resettlement; (vii) environmental protection and \nmitigation  of  adverse  environmental  effects;  (viii)  consulting  services  for  construction \nsupervision, monitoring and evaluation, and marketing and business development; and (ix) \nstrengthening of institutional capabilities. The key inputs needed for project implementation \ninclude civil works, equipment, consultants, and MOR and Project Company staff.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n26.  Energy and Pollution Benefits. Railways as a mode of transport are more energy-\nefficient and environmentally friendly than road transport. Rolling resistance of a steel wheel on \na rail is much less than that of rubber tires on a pavement; some theoretical estimates indicate \nthat rail transport is between 6 and 10 times more energy efficient than road. In the United \nStates,  the  Department  of  Energy  has  estimated23 the  energy  intensity  of  rail  freight  at \n345 British Thermal Units (BTUs) per ton-mile and road freight at 3,476 BTUs per ton-mile. This \nindicates that rail is about 10 times as energy efficient as truck transport\u2014a range similar to the \n                                                 \n22 Supplementary Appendix B describes the characteristics of the TZR. \n23  US Department of Energy. 2004.Transport Energy Data Book, Edition 24. \n ", "  9 \nestimate made by Canadian researchers.24 Based on the International Energy Agency report25 \nand fuel data from China Statistical Yearbook 200526, the diverted traffic from road to rail will \nlead to a saving of 1.16 million ton oil equivalent (mtoe) in 2012 and 1.85 mtoe in 2020, which \nwill result in a benefit (on account of reduced fuel consumption) of CNY273.8 million in 2012. \nThere is a direct relationship between energy consumption and emission of harmful pollutants, \nand rail transport emits far fewer harmful elements compared with road. These emissions \ninclude carbon dioxide (CO ), nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, sulfur oxides, and suspended \n2\nparticles. Under the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, a value can be placed on CO emissions; \n2 \ncertified emission reductions of CO  are presently valued in the PRC at $8 per ton.27 Using \n2\nspecific fuel usage and emission rates for the PRC, the diverted traffic from road to rail will \nresult in reduced CO  emissions by 34,000 tons in 2012, rising to 56,000 tons in 2020; this will \n2\nresult in an annual benefit of CNY 2.2 million in 2012, increasing to CNY 3.60 million in 2020.    \n \n27.  Subregional  Context.  The  proposed  railway  is  the  shortest  east\u2013west  railway  link \nproviding land access to Europe through Kazakhstan. The Project will promote railway and \nmultimodal transport of goods and people in the region and thus support regional cooperation. \nMOR  has  agreed  to  construct  three  extra-large  container  terminals  at  Qingdao,  Lanzhou, \nTaiyuan,  and  container  handling  facilities  at  Yinchuan  (i)  attract  high-value  traffic  on  the \nrailways; (ii) promote intermodal traffic; and (iii) encourage private sector shippers and freight \nforwarders to use the facility for export and import of cargo to other parts of the PRC, ports in \nthe east, and Central Asia and Europe in the west. These will be financed by MOR and \ncompleted by 2010. \n \n28.  Safety. ADB policy dialogue has emphasized the need for operational reforms for the \nrail  network,  including  enhancing  safety  by  introducing  safe  and  reliable  technology; \nmodernizing maintenance systems; and monitoring safety performance. A project component \n($13.4 million equivalent, of which $2.6 million will be financed by the ADB loan) will promote \nand enhance railway safety. It will finance the procurement of operation and maintenance \nequipment to enhance safety and build capacity, including staff training. \n \n29.  Signaling,  E-Governance  and  Management  Information  System.  Part  of  ADB\u2019s \npolicy  dialogue  emphasized  introducing  modern  management  systems  and  high-quality \ninformation  systems  for  the  PRC  railway  network.  A  project  component  ($52.3  million \nequivalent, of which $30.0 million will be financed by the ADB loan) will introduce a modern \noperating dispatch information system, linking the project train and national train reservation \nsystems, and introducing a simulation system to monitor and analyze train performance.  \n \n30.  Tourism.  Shanxi,  Shaanxi,  and  Ningxia  are  important  tourist  destinations  and  the \nProject  will  support  tourism  development.  Local  government  support  to  the  communities, \nincluding the poor, to promote tourism business has been successful, including village home \nstays  and  handicrafts.  The  provincial  and  the  local  governments  agreed  to  increase  such \nsupport by reallocating some of the increased tax revenue from the Project.    \n \n31.  Opportunities for Private Sector. The Project Company will outsource activities such \nas  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  testing,  construction  contracts,  track \nmaintenance, and industrial sidings by open competition. The Project will encourage private \nsector initiatives such as onboard train services, including catering, cleaning, and loading and \nunloading  at  railway  stations.  Station  space  will  be  developed  and  rented  out  by  open \n                                                 \n24  The Railway Association of Canada. 2001.

ADB has engaged MOR in dialogue aimed at enhancing policy reform during \nthe project processing and this will be continued. Under the Project, significant steps are equity \nparticipation by the three provinces and setting up a corporate entity to construct, operate, and \nmanage  the  Project.  ADB  fact-finding  Mission  also  explored  the  possibility  of  diversified \nfinancing sources, including strategic investors and the private sector. China Development Bank \nand China Construction Bank have already committed financing. Three strategic investors have \nexpressed interest in participating in the project equity.28 This will be followed up. Specific \nmeasures are proposed under the Project to outsource some of the activities to date handled by \nrailways, and involve the private sector. At the national level, abolishing one tier of railway \nmanagement is a major step. MOR will continue the process of separating the core and noncore \nactivities and rationalization of staff. The Project will bring in new technology, emphasize safety, \nand build capacity for MOR and the joint venture railways.  \n \n33.  Social Development Plan. The Project will facilitate economic development, which will \nbenefit  the  largely  poor  population,  particularly  women  and  the  vulnerable.  The  social \ndevelopment action plan (SDAP) will (i) enhance project benefits; (ii) ensure adverse impacts \nare avoided or mitigated; and (iii) ensure economic development benefits the poor, women, \nethnic minorities, and the vulnerable in an equitable and sustainable manner. \n \n34.  Stakeholder  Consultation  and  Participation.  Extensive  consultations\u2014including \nsurveys\u2014involved  about  15,450  people,  such  as  local  villagers,  tourists,  businesspersons, \ntransport  users,  and  local  governments  (Appendix  7).  This  helped  to  (i) understand  public \nopinion  about  the  proposed  railway;  (ii) conduct  the  environmental,  economic,  and  social \nassessments; (iii) plan resettlement; and (iv) identify the role of various stakeholders. Leading \ngroups  have  been  formed  in  the  prefectures  with  participation  from  relevant  government \nagencies, including poverty reduction offices; All-China Women\u2019s Federation; and health, civil \naffairs, and ethnic affairs bureaus. The local governments assured that the consultation process \nwill be continued to finalize the design and formulate appropriate land compensation, relocation, \nand rehabilitation measures. \n \n35.  Small Business Development Opportunities. The Project includes 41 railway stations, \nwhich will be connected to villages, townships, and counties by roads and other transport \nnetworks. These stations and the station access roads, construction of access roads, and link \nroads will help develop small businesses and commercial activities, including setting up small \nshops, kiosks, local handicraft shops, and areas where local people can sell local fruits and \nagro-products. The local governments assured that the railway stations and surrounding areas \nwill  be  developed  with  local  communities  to  promote  local  businesses,  income-generating \nactivities, and other opportunities that can benefit all communities, especially the remote poor \nand women; and agreed to provide entrepreneurial training and start-up capital (microfinance) \nfor small businesses to local people.   \n \n36.  Employment Opportunities for Local People. About 453,000 person-years of work will \nbe created for unskilled laborers during construction, of which 50% or more will be targeted at \npoor,  resettlement-affected  people,  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  other  vulnerable  people \ntotaling 217,500 person-years with total wages of CNY1,631 million. The use of locally produced \nmaterials for railway construction will generate an additional 83,000 person-years of work for \nunskilled laborers, with total wages of CNY605.2 million. When the new railway starts full \noperation in 2012, an estimated 8,954 jobs will be created with total wages of CNY107.4 million \n                                                 \n28  China Communication Construction Engineering Group, Beijing; China Engineering Construction Group, Beijing; \nand Shaanxi Province Hualong Energy Limited Liability Company, Xi\u2019an. \n ", "  11 \nannually; that will increase to 13,922 jobs and CNY289.4 million in wages by 2030. Expecting \nmore efficient freight transport and business travels using the project railway, many enterprises \nin the project area are planning to expand their outputs and increase labor by an estimated \n52,437 jobs as a result of the TZR. Freight traffic generated by the TZR will result in the creation \nof 11,500 additional jobs in 2012, increasing to 36,454 jobs in 2030. The poverty reduction \noffices and Women\u2019s Federations will tailor their programs to ensure sustained gains from \nemployment, and income-generating activities from the railway project are targeted at the poor \nand vulnerable by providing training and capacity building.  \n \n37.  Complementary  Development  Initiatives. To enhance development impacts in the \nproject area, the Mission had extensive discussion with Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provincial \nand local governments to provide road access, electricity, good drinking water, and telephone \nconnectivity to all the poverty villages along the alignment. The respective provincial and local \ngovernments  agreed  to  include  these  in the 11th  FYP.  The  local  governments  agreed,  in \nprinciple, to provide road access to 338 villages, electricity supply to 78 villages, drinking water \nto 1,573 villages, and telephone connections to 1,197 villages by the end of the 11th FYP \n(2010). The mission also dialogued with local governments to reallocate part of the construction \ntax revenue (3.4% of the civil works contract value) to undertake development programs in the \nproject area. The local governments agreed to reallocate part of the tax revenue to relevant \nagencies to undertake development programs in the project area.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n38.  The project investment cost is estimated at the equivalent of $3,752.9 million, comprising \nforeign exchange costs of $1.080 billion (28.8%) and local currency costs of the equivalent of \n$2.673 billion (71.2%). Table 1 summarizes the project investment plan and details are in \nAppendix 8. The cost estimates are based on quantities derived from preliminary engineering \ndesigns and unit rates reflecting market prices for goods and materials; and include the costs of \nland acquisition and resettlement, and environmental monitoring.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Total  \nA.

Financing Plan \n39.  The Government has requested a loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum, \nconversion options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  regulations  and \nconversion guidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. \nThe front-end fee will be waived. The Government has provided ADB with (i) reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n40.  ADB will finance 100% of the contract packages procured under the ADB loan. MOR will \nfinance the remaining foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost will be financed by MOR, \nShanxi and Shaanxi provincial governments (SPG and SAPG), NHAR, and cofinancing through \ntwo loans from the China Development Bank and China Construction Bank. The two banks \nhave appraised the Project and provided a commitment letter to MOR. The China Development \nBank loan is repayable over 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at a lending rate \ncurrently at 5.5% per annum. The China Construction Bank loan is repayable over 15 years, \nincluding a grace period, at a lending rate currently at 5.5% per annum. SAPG, SPG, and NHAR \nwill finance the land acquisition and resettlement costs; this will be their equity contribution. \nMOR, SPG, SAPG, and NHAR have made budgetary provisions for the counterpart funds. The \nallocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement will be presented with reference only to total \nexpenditure, in accordance with the policy on Cost Sharing and Eligibility for Asian Development \nBank Financing: A New Approach.29 A summary of the financing plan is in Table 2 and details \nare in Appendix 8. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total   % \nAsian Development Bank   300.0  8.0 \nMOR, SPG, SAPG, and NHAR  1,314.4  35.0 \nChina Development Bank   1,606.3  42.8 \nChina Construction Bank  532.2  14.2 \n     Total  3,752.9  100.0 \nMOR  =  Ministry  of  Railways,  NHAR  =  Ningxia  Autonomous  Region \ngovernment, SAPG = Shaanxi provincial government, SPG = Shanxi provincial \ngovernment.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n41.  MOR will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall project implementation. The \nForeign  Capital  and  Technical  Import  Center,  under  MOR,  will  coordinate  the  project \nmanagement office's tasks and be responsible for procurement, withdrawals, and reporting vis-\n\u00e0-vis ADB. MOR is in the process of setting up a project company (the Project Company), a \nlimited liability company under the PRC Company Law, which will be the project Implementing \nAgency. The Project Company will (i) manage and operate the project railway after completion \nof  the  construction;  and  (ii)  develop  and  implement  adequate  and  transparent  business \ndevelopment mechanisms, and accounting and reporting systems. A project leading group \n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2005. Cost Sharing and Eligibility for Asian Development Bank Financing. Manila.  \n ", "  13 \nheaded  by  a  director  general  and  assisted  by  an  adequate  number  of  suitably  qualified \nprofessional staff has been established. It is undertaking the preparatory work of setting up the \nProject Company and is setting up the on-site construction management offices along the \nproject  route.  The staff  is  experienced  in  railway  engineering,  financial,  and  administrative \nmatters; and implementing projects financed by international financial institutions. This leading \ngroup will be merged with the Project Company once it is established. To develop the Project \nCompany\u2019s  project  management,  business  development,  and  marketing  capacity,  further \nassistance will be provided by the project-financed consulting services. Setting up the Project \nCompany is a condition for disbursement. The financial assessment questionnaire indicates that \nthe  Project  will  have  an  adequate  financial  management  system  in  place  (details  in \nSupplementary Appendix C).  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n42.  The Project will be implemented over about 6 years from July 2006 to June 2012. Civil \nworks will start in December 2006 and be completed in about 4 years. Trial operations will start \nin July 2011 and last for 1 year before commercial operations begin (Appendix 9).  \n \n3.  Procurement \n43.  All  ADB  financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines.  ADB  will \nfinance  procurement  of  materials  and  equipment  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan \n(Appendix 10). Contracts valued in excess of $1 million will be procured through international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB). Contracts valued at less than $1 million may follow ICB, national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB), or limited international bidding (LIB) as determined by the particular \ncircumstances of the contract package. Below $100,000, procurement may follow the shopping \nprocedure. MOR will select tendering companies on a competitive basis to handle international \nbidding. The relevant sections of ADB's anticorruption policy30 will be included in all documents \nand contracts during bidding for, and implementation of, the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n44.  The Government will engage and finance qualified domestic consultants for (i) detailed \nproject  design;  (ii)  preparation  of  technical  specifications;  (iii)  construction  supervision; \n(iv) construction  quality  assurance;  (v)  environmental  supervision  and  management; \n(vi) monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  resettlement  plan;  and  (vii)  socioeconomic  impact \nassessment, evaluation of poverty reduction, and project performance monitoring. \n \n45.  The ADB loan will be used to finance 10 person-months of international consulting \nservices to strengthen institutional, marketing, and business development functions of the Project \nCompany. Terms of reference for the international consultants\u2014to be recruited using the quality- \nand cost-based method and simplified technical proposal, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants\u2014are in Appendix 11. The provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy \nwill be included in all invitation documents and contracts for international consultants.  \n \n  5.  Anticorruption Measures \n46.  ADB's  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to,  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or though its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB's anticorruption policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \n                                                 \n30 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Manila. \n ", "14   \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of MOR, the Project Company and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n47.  In relation to the Project, MOR will ensure that (i) a supervisory body is established for \nprevention of undue interference in business practices, and adequate resources are made \navailable for its effective operation; (ii) a leading group of officials from the supervision division \nof MOR is located in offices involved in the bidding, construction, and other operational activities \nunder the Project; and (iii) periodic inspections on the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund \nwithdrawals and settlements are carried out. MOR and the Project Company shall also initiate \nliaison meetings with the prosecutor\u2019s office, on a needs basis, where warnings about, or \ninformation on, corrupt practices can be discussed. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements and Imprest Fund \n48.  The  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook31 and relevant guidelines including procedures for Libor-based loan. Since most \npayments  will  be  made  for  large  contracts  well  above  $100,000,  direct  payment, \nreimbursements, and commitment procedures will be used. If the Government initially funds \neligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  followed.  To  facilitate \ndisbursements, MOR requested an imprest account32 after loan effectiveness. Disbursements \nfrom the imprest account will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal application and related \ndocumentation.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  set  as  either  the  estimated \nexpenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  of  imprest  account  and \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $200,000.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  The Project Company will maintain separate accounts for the Project and have such \naccounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The Project Company, through MOR, will submit to \nADB, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, certified copies of such audited project \naccounts  and  financial  statements  and  auditor's  reports,  all  in  English.  The  audit  of  such \nfinancial statements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal \ncontrol systems with respect to project expenditures and other financial transactions, (ii) an \nassessment of compliance with loan covenants and ADB requirements for project management, \nand  (iii)  an  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedure.  The  Project \nCompany will also submit its audited financial statements covering income statements, balance \nsheets, and cash-flow statements during the first 3 years of commercial operations of the project \nrailway within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. To ensure that the effective internal \ncontrol system and checks and balances mechanism are put in place, the Project Company will \nestablish an internal audit unit within the company. The unit will independently test financial \ntransactions to ensure the safe custody of the project-financed assets and report directly to the \nProject Company's board of directors. \n \n50.  The Project Company will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of \nproject implementation by submitting quarterly progress reports through MOR. Within 3 months \nof completion, MOR will submit a project completion report to ADB.  \n \n                                                 \n31  2001. ADB. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n32  Imprest accounts are used in three ongoing loans in the PRC. The utilization performance is satisfactory. \n ", "  15 \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n51.  MOR agreed to a set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its \nimpacts, outcomes, outputs, and conditions. The indicators, to be reviewed at the start of project \nimplementation, include (i) economic development and socioeconomic indicators, (ii) transport \ncosts and time for passenger and freight services, (iii) transport services and transport charges, \n(iv) accident rates, (v) financial sustainability, (vi) county and/or village incomes, (vii) access to \nsocial services, and (viii) jobs created in construction and maintenance. At the beginning of \nproject implementation, MOR and the Project Company will establish baseline and target values \nfor the indicators. The indicators will be measured at project inception, completion, and 3 years \nlater; and compared with the baseline. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by \ngender (Appendix 12). MOR will recruit qualified consultants for monitoring and evaluation to \nhelp establish the monitoring and evaluation system, and train the Project Company staff in its \nuse.  The  main  sources  of  data  include  (i)  secondary  data  from  government  sources, \n(ii) household socioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory rapid appraisal. MOR will \nsubmit a report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years \nlater to ADB. \n  \n9.  Project Review \n52.  In 2009, ADB, MOR, and the Project Company will carry out a midterm review of the \nProject, covering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, \npoverty reduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have \nan impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing viability. The review will examine \nprogress in sector reforms, policy development, resettlement, environment, poverty impact, and \ncompliance with assurances in the Loan Agreement. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n53.  The project benefits and impacts were assessed along with potential risks associated \nwith the Project. The combined benefits and impacts will outweigh the costs, and net benefits \nwill accrue to the project area. \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n54.  The traffic forecast was based on forecasts prepared by the Third Survey and Design \nInstitute  (TSDI),  by  considering  expected  economic  growth,  population  increase,  tourism \ndevelopment  potential,  local  government  development  plans,  market  surveys,  and  the \nassessment of TA consultants. The passenger volume on the TZR is forecast to grow from 1.89 \nbillion passenger-km in 2012 to 5.93 billion passenger-km in 2031, with an average growth rate \nof 6.2%. The freight traffic on the TZR corridor is forecast to increase from about 22.22 billion \nton-km in 2012 to 73.19 billion ton-km in 2031, with an annual growth rate of 6.5% based on \nsimilar factors. The projected volumes can be accommodated by the TZR and justify project \nconstruction (Appendix 13). \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n55.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project situations. The TZR will reduce the cost of transport to and from the poor central \nand northwestern part of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provinces. Economic costs include costs \nfor construction, operation, and maintenance costs, and value of agricultural production from \nland  lost  permanently.  Economic  benefits  include  (i) operating  cost  savings  for  freight  and \npassenger  traffic,  (ii)  time  saving  in  diverted  passenger  traffic  from  buses,  (iii)  generated \ntransport benefits, (iv) tourism benefits, (v) avoided road infrastructure and maintenance costs, \n(vi) shipper savings because of increased railway competition, (vii) avoided road accidents, (viii) \n ", "16   \npollution reduction benefits, (ix) energy savings, and (x) national productivity benefits. The \nproject EIRR is 18.2%, indicating the Project is economically viable (Appendix 13). Sensitivity \nanalysis  confirms  the  robustness  of  the  Project's  economic  viability.  Changes  in  the  key \nvariables, such as a 20% reduction in benefits, do not significantly impact economic viability. \nThe capital cost would have to increase by 146% over those estimated for the EIRR to fall \nbelow the cutoff rate of 12%. Freight benefits would have to fall by 54% and passenger benefits \nby 2,424%. Given experience in the PRC railway sector, variations of such magnitude are \nunlikely. Project risks were quantified using the statistical method, i.e., considering the possible \nvalue for key variables and the probability with which they may occur. The result shows that the \nEIRR will exceed 12% with 98% probability. Distribution analysis, undertaken by determining the \nproject effects for various beneficiaries, indicates that a large portion of net benefits will accrue \nto project users and economy. \n \nC.  Financial Benefits  \n56.  Financial  projections  prepared  for  the  Project  Company,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects33, assessed \nthe financial viability and sustainability of the railway (Appendix 14). The projected financial \nstatements indicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to cover operation and maintenance \ncosts, income taxes, and debt service; and provide a reasonable rate of return. The financial \nevaluation was undertaken in real terms using constant 2005 prices. The project cost estimates \nand financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the \nprojected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. Incremental costs \nand benefits were derived under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate \nof return, computed on an after-tax basis, is 8.4%. This compares favorably with the weighted \naverage cost of capital, also computed on an after-tax basis, of 2.2%. The Project is both \nfinancially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the financial internal \nrate of return for the Project is robust under most conditions (Appendix 14). \n \n57.  Consolidated financial statements for the Project Company have been prepared. Based \non the consultant\u2019s estimates, the Project Company\u2019s financial performance is projected to be \nsound and sustainable over the operating period (Appendix 14). Financial ratios were discussed \nand covenanted. \n \nD.  Environmental Impact and Assessment \n58.  The  Project  is  classified  as  ADB  environmental  category  A.  TSDI  prepared  an \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) for the proposed project, which was approved by State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration. MOR endorsed the summary environmental impact \nassessment (SEIA), which was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and uploaded on the ADB \nwebsite on 15 February 2006 (Supplementary Appendix E).  \n \n59.  Potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  include  (i)  noise  and  vibration  impacts  on \nadjacent residents; (ii) soil erosion from cut and fill activities; (iii) disturbance of historical, \ncultural, and archaeological sites; (iv) impact on surface water quality of adjacent waterways; \nand (v) public health and safety. \n  \n60.  The  EIA  concluded  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be  successfully \nmitigated through the use of best practices and appropriate technologies. Implementation of the \nenvironmental management, mitigation, and monitoring programs included in the EIA will ensure \ncompliance with ADB and government environmental guidelines and procedures. Internal and \nexternal monitoring and audits will be conducted to ensure that standards and regulations are \n                                                 \n33  ADB. 2003.

An independent monitoring agency will be hired to carry out external monitoring and \nevaluation work during implementation. \n \nE.  Impact on Poverty  \n61.  The  railway  passes  through  three  provinces/region  (Shanxi,  Shaanxi,  and  Ningxia); \nseven municipalities/prefectures (Taiyuan, Jinzhong, Luliang, Yulin, Wuxhong, Zhongwei, and \nYinchuan); and 22 counties/districts, of which 11 are designated national or provincial poverty \ncounties. The Project will benefit 6.5 million people in the project area, of which 70% are rural \nand 21.5% are poor. There are 1,527 designated poverty villages (31% of total) with about \n979,000 poor people (15%) in the project area. In urban areas (two districts), there are poor \npeople with per capita income less than that of minimum living standards who will benefit from \nmore affordable travel along this corridor. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 16. \n \n62.  The links between poverty, topography, and poor transport systems are apparent in the \nproject area. Poverty in this area is caused by (i) adverse environmental and weather conditions \nand limited farmland (e.g., desert, mountains, cold weather, water scarcity, and soil erosion); \n(ii) geographical remoteness and isolation, and high transport costs; (iii) limited access to credit \nfor rural enterprises; (iv) lack of access to good social and health care facilities; and (v) high \ncost of middle and higher-level education. \n \n63.  About  453,000  person-years  of  work  will  be  created  for  unskilled  laborers  during \nconstruction, of which 50% or more will be targeted at the poor, totaling 217,500 person-years \nwith  total  wages  of  CNY1,631  million.  The  use  of  locally  produced  materials  for  railway \nconstruction will generate an additional 83,000 person-years of work for unskilled laborers, with \ntotal wages of CNY605.2 million. Priority will be given to women, resettlement-affected people, \nethnic minorities, and other vulnerable people. When the new railway starts full operation in \n2012,  an  estimated  8,954  direct  and  indirect  jobs  will  be  created  with  total  wages  of \nCNY107.4 million annually; that will increase to 13,922 jobs and CNY289.4 million in wages by \n2030. The estimated construction tax revenue to counties will be reallocated and used for the \nrange of poverty reduction and social activities, including mitigation of negative impacts on \nHIV/AIDS/STIs34, human trafficking, and the environment, with special attention to resettlement-\naffected groups, women, ethnic groups, and other vulnerable people in the project area. \n \n64.  The project\u2019s 41 new railway stations will be connected to the road network accessible \nby all villages, including the poor, and will create various jobs to help distribute the benefits in \nthe  project  area.  There  will  be  sufficient  space  in  and  around  the  stations  for  local  area \ndevelopment; and local governments will support the poor, women, ethnic groups, and other \nvulnerable  people  to  sell  local  specialties  and  other  goods  and  services.  Expecting  more \nefficient freight transport and business travels using the project railway, many enterprises in the \nproject area have been planning to expand their outputs and would increase labor by an \nestimated 52,437 jobs as a result of the TZR. Revenues generated by TZR freight traffic will \ncreate 11,500 jobs in 2012, and increase to 36,454 jobs in 2030. All of these direct and indirect \nimpacts  will  provide  conditions  for  poor  families  to  (i)  move  away  from  unsustainable, \nmountainous farmlands; (ii) have better access to markets, and advanced educational and \nhealth facilities, especially for women; and (iii) build a sustainable future in new centers of \neconomic activity. \n                                                 \n34  STI = sexually transmitted infections. \n ", "18   \nF.  Resettlement Impact  \n65.  The project railway alignment will cross more than 550 villages in 20 counties and \n2 urban districts from Taiyuan to Zhongwei and Yinchuan. An estimated 4,656 hectares (ha) of \nland will be permanently acquired, of which 42% is dryland, 36% is irrigated farmland, 8% is \norchard, 3% is vegetable plots, 3% is woodland, and 8% is wasteland/desert. The Project will \nalso temporarily occupy 1,872 ha for TZR construction activities and access; the amount has \nbeen reduced by utilizing existing railway lands. An estimated 428,395 square meters (m2) of \nstructures will be affected, of which 81% are residential structures and other farm structures, \n13% are sheds, 5% are factory buildings/workshops, and 1% are school buildings. Based on the \nPRC standard for impact assessment, about 11,803 will lose all their land and agricultural \nlivelihoods and 11,956 will have their houses demolished. Since the railway will only require a \nnarrow corridor, it is estimated that the average loss of land per household would be 15%, which \nmeans the number of partially affected people would be about 78,687; and those losing more \nthan 25% would be about 8,000. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were minimized by \naligning the railway away from urban areas, village centers, and other facilities, where possible, \nbased on consultations with communities (Appendix 15).  \n \n66.  MOR, in consultation with provincial and local governments, has prepared a resettlement \nplan (RP) based on the preliminary design study; surveys of 79 villages; 3,487 household \nsurveys; local government statistics; and consultations with local officials, village leaders, and \naffected households. Although the total amount of land and people affected are large, these \nimpacts are spread thinly over a long narrow corridor.35 Special assistance will be provided to \nvulnerable households that include the poor, widows, the disabled, and ethnic minority Hui \nhouseholds. \n \n67.  Local government land administration bureaus, in conjunction with railway construction \nsupport offices, will be responsible for implementing resettlement; many activities will be carried \nout  by  township  officials  and  village  committees.  The  estimated  resettlement  cost  is \n$183.1 million, excluding contingencies. Agreements were signed between MOR and Shanxi, \nShaanxi, and Ningxia governments whereby the local governments will fund 100% of the cost of \nland acquisition and resettlement which in turn will be an equity contribution to the Project. The \nresettlement budget will be adjusted based on the actual measurement of physical losses, \nmarket prices, and final compensation standards. Affected people have been consulted about \nthe likely impacts during the feasibility and preliminary design stages. Resettlement information \nbooklets, in local language, have been distributed to affected villages. The local governments \nand MOR have endorsed the RP. The RP was uploaded to the ADB website on 14 April 2006. \nMOR will submit an updated RP to ADB by 31 December 2006. \n \n68.  MOR and municipal-level land acquisition and resettlement offices, in collaboration with \nthe county resettlement offices, will be responsible for internal supervision and monitoring. \nProgress reports will be submitted to ADB on a quarterly basis, until resettlement is completed. \nMOR will then prepare a resettlement completion report for submission to ADB. In addition, an \nindependent  monitor  will  carry  out  the  external  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  prepare \nmonitoring  reports  for  submission  to  MOR  and  ADB  every  6  months  until  completion  of \nresettlement activities; thereafter, annual evaluation investigations will be conducted for at least \n2 years and reported to MOR and ADB.  \n \n                                                 \n35 The land use for railways is much less compared with a highway of equivalent capacity (a 16-lane highway is \nrequired to equal the cargo carrying capacity of a double-track railway).   \n ", "  19 \nG.  Ethnic Minorities \n69.   The  Project  area  includes  619,400  people  with  ethnic  minority  nationalities,  which \nrepresent 9.6% of the project area\u2019s population. The main ethnic group in the project area is \nHui,  who  are  descendants  of  Muslim  traders  that  settled  in  Ningxia  (which  is  now  an \nautonomous  region).  About  2,000  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement. \nInvestigations revealed that the Hui villagers were integrated with the Han and shared the same \nsocioeconomic  conditions.  Since  some  of  the  affected  minority  villages  are  poor,  specific \nprovisions are included in the RP for livelihood training, employment on construction, access to \nrural credit, assistance with house construction, and social security. The Project includes a \nsocial development action plan (SDAP) to enhance benefits for poor or vulnerable people in the \nproject area. Hui minorities are included as a target group in the SDAP (Appendix 17).  \n  \nH.  Social and Gender Aspects  \n70.  The Project will generate job opportunities (skilled and unskilled) for the poor, ethnic \nminorities,  women,  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  which  will  help  develop  their  job  skills. \nSufficient areas for income-generating activities will be designated in and around the station. \nConstruction and operation-related job opportunities and those generated from the Project will \nprovide potential new sources of income for local residents. An increase in female participation \nin the labor and tourism market has the potential to increase women\u2019s net income and savings, \nimprove overall family welfare, and improve the status of women. Through several ongoing \nprograms along the alignment, the All-China Women\u2019s Federation will specifically address the \nneeds of women and children. The federation will operate even more actively in the project area \nso that women are able to take full advantage of additional work and income opportunities \nfacilitated by the Project to build businesses that help sustain their families.  \n \n71.  Women and other vulnerable groups will benefit from the Project, and have equal access \nto project-generated employment and wages. The railway will generate demand for local labor \nand increase worker productivity and wages. Under PRC law, women are given equal rights in \nemployment.  Expansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  will  help  generate  additional \nemployment  opportunities  for  both  men  and  women.  Afforestation  activities  will  provide \nadditional employment opportunities for women relatively close to their homes.  \n \n72.  The construction and operation of the railway could have an impact on HIV/AIDS/STIs   \ndue to a large number of workers during construction. The project area has much smaller \nnumbers of HIV/AIDS infection compared with other parts of the PRC, based on discussions \nwith local health bureaus. Local governments have an active public information program for \nHIV/AIDS awareness, including distribution of leaflets and posters, radio, and televisions. Even \nthe poor in remote areas have knowledge of prevention methods for HIV/AIDS and STIs. The \nhealth departments in these provinces have carried out awareness programs, HIV/AIDS/STIs \nvoluntary counseling and testing, and prevention programs; these will be continued.  \n \n73.  During the construction period, the county governments along the alignment will raise \npublic awareness among workers and communities. MOR has experience in ensuring that \ncontractors implement awareness and prevention programs during railway construction. Medical \nclinics were established in the area of construction camps, and HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns \nand  preventive  measures  for  workers  and  communities  were  organized  during  railway \nconstruction. These activities will continue during the construction and operation of the Project. \nCombined with increased awareness efforts by local government and the Department of Health, \nthe potential risks of STI/HIV/AIDS transmission will be adequately managed. \n \n74.  An SDAP has been prepared in consultation with local governments to enhance the \nproject benefits; ensure the adverse impacts are avoided or mitigated; and increase economic \n ", "20   \ndevelopment benefits to the poor, women, ethnic minorities, and the vulnerable in an equitable \nand sustainable manner (Appendix 17). The SDAP will (i) enhance job opportunities for local \npeople; (ii) provide training and vocational programs for the poor, women, ethnic minorities, and \nthe vulnerable; (iii) support HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs; (iv) support income \nrecovery programs for people affected by resettlement; (v) provide awareness and prevention \nprograms  for  safety  during  construction  and  operation;  and  (vi)  promote  local  economic \ndevelopment. This will be implemented with participation from relevant government agencies at \nthe local level\u2014including poverty alleviation offices; All-China Women\u2019s Federation; and health, \ncivil affairs, labor, and ethnic affairs bureaus. Leading groups have been formed to continue the \nprocess of consultation and coordination among various agencies during implementation. \n \nI.  Risks and Assumptions \n75.  The Project is formulated to minimize potential risks. Based on experience with previous \nrailway  projects,  traffic  demand  is  estimated  conservatively.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that \neconomic circumstances would have to become substantially adverse for the Project to lose \neconomic viability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay the realization \nof benefits. MOR has successfully built railway lines, such as the Ganzhou\u2013Longyan, Hefei\u2013\nXi\u2019an,  and  Jing\u2013Jiu  railways.  Government,  MOR,  SPG,  SAPG,  and  NHAR  support  for  the \nProject and its preparation contributes to reducing the potential risk of implementation delays. \nEnvironmental risks will be mitigated by the measures in the environmental management plan \n(EMP) and will be closely monitored during project implementation. \n \n76.  The Project will cause the relocation of 11,956 people and partial loss of land for 78,687 \npeople.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  preferential  treatment  for  employment  during \nconstruction, supply of local materials, allocation of commercial space near railway stations, and \njob training. The resettlement plan and SDAP will be closely monitored to ensure compliance \nwith ADB social safeguard policies. \n \n77.  Intermodal competition among railways and roads will create market risks for the project \nrailway. However, the existing road is already congested and capacity constraints are expected \nto worsen. Traffic surveys indicate that the railway has several advantages: lower fares, shorter \ntravel times, safety, and punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation of the joint-venture \nrailway will help lower risks posed by intermodal competition. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n78.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  Reform measures. The Government will take necessary measures to continue \nimplementation of the Railway Development Plan (2004) including (a) separation \nof the core railway operations from noncore transportation business operations, \n(b) rationalization of staff, and (c) encouragement of the Project Company to \noutsource some activities currently handled by railways. \n \n(ii)  Construction  quality.

The Government will cause the \nProject  Company  to  (a)  establish  and  maintain  an  internal  audit  unit,  the \ncomposition and the terms of reference of which will be acceptable to ADB, and \nundertake timely audit of project accounts in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles, and (b) submit to ADB audited accounts and financial \nstatements during construction and in the first 3 years of commercial operations \nof the project railway within 6 months of the end of each relevant fiscal year. \n \n(xi)  Tariff. The Government will ensure that MOR and the Project Company set the \ntariffs, with respect to the project railway, at rates sufficient to ensure full cost \nrecovery including the management cost of the Project Company and working \n(operation  and  maintenance)  costs  of  the  project  railway,  depreciation,  debt \nservice, taxes, and a reasonable profit. \n \n(xii)  Tariff study. The Government will also ensure that the Project Company, in \nconsultation  with  MOR,  carries  out  a  tariff  study  6  months  prior  to  the  trial \noperation of the project railway, and advises ADB of the tariffs applied during \nsuch trial operation. \n \n ", "22   \n(xiii)  Anticorruption.  During  project  implementation,  the  Government  shall  follow \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, it being understood that ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. The Government will cause \nMOR to ensure that (a) a supervisory body is established for prevention of undue \ninterference in business practices, and adequate resources are made available \nfor its effective operation; (b) a leading group of officials from the Discipline Unit \nand  Supervision  Department  of  MOR  are  located  in  offices  involved  in  the \nbidding,  construction,  and  other  operational  activities  under  the  Project; \n(c) periodic inspections on the contractors\u2019 activities related to fund withdrawals \nand settlements are carried out; (d) relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in all bidding documents for the project; and (e) all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the project include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MOR and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to \nthe Project.  The Government shall also cause MOR and the Project Company to \ninitiate liaison meetings with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, on a needs basis, where \nwarnings about or information on corrupt practices can be discussed. \n \n(xiv)  Environment. The Government will cause MOR, the Project Company, SPG, \nSAPG,  and  NHAR  to  ensure  that  (a)  the  Project  is  designed,  constructed, \noperated, and maintained in accordance with environmental laws and regulations \nof the Government and the ADB Environment Policy;36 (b) the EMP and the \nmitigation measures included therein, as specified in the project EIA, are properly \nimplemented;  (c)  the  EMP  is  updated,  at  engineering  design  stage,  and \nincorporated into bidding documents and civil contracts; (d) any environmental \npermits,  licenses,  and  clearances  are  obtained  in  a  timely  manner;  (e)  any \nadverse impact on the environment that may arise from project implementation \nactivities is promptly mitigated or minimized in accordance with the EMP; and \n(f) implementation  of  the  EMP,  including  any  safety  breaches,  violation  of \nenvironmental standards, and corrective measures taken thereto, is reported \nsemiannually to ADB. \n \n(xv)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  will  cause MOR,  the \nProject Company, SPG, SAPG, and NHAR to ensure that (a) the RP is updated \nand approved by ADB, before the start of land acquisition and is carried out \npromptly and efficiently in accordance with all applicable Government laws and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement; (b) all affected people \nare  given  adequate  opportunity  to  participate  in  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation;  (c)  those  affected  are  compensated  and  assisted  prior  to \ndisplacement from their houses, land, and assets, such that they will be at least \nas well off as they would have been in the absence of the Project; (d) adequate \nand appropriate support is provided for enterprise relocation; (e) affected people \nreceive priority for employment in project construction; (f) special measures are \nimplemented for ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups; (g) civil works contracts \ninclude requirements to comply with the resettlement plan; (h) implementation of \nthe resettlement plan is monitored internally by the Project Company and the \nrespective local governments, and externally by an independent institute; and (i) \nrelated reports are submitted to ADB and MOR as stipulated in the resettlement \nplan.

Railway Sector Profile \n \n1.  Key Features. Despite Government efforts to increase the country's transport capacity, \nserious constraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road and railway sectors. By the end \nof  2005,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  transport  system  comprised  about  75,438 \nkilometers (km) of railways, 1.86 million km of highways, 123,300 km of inland waterways, and \n2.05 million km of civil aviation routes. However, the density of the transport network ranks among \nthe  lowest  in  the  world  relative  to  either  population  or  geographic  area. From  1978,  when \neconomic reforms were first introduced, through to 2005, the PRC experienced sustained rapid \neconomic growth. This resulted in an accordingly rapid increase in demand for transportation. \nThe annual growth of passenger transport was 7.6% and freight transport 9.0% during 1978\u2013\n2004. In 2005, road traffic accounted for 53.2% of total passenger-km, followed by railways with \n34.7%, civil aviation with 11.7%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. The modal split \nfor freight ton-km was 61.3% for coastal and inland waterways, 26.5% for railways, 11.0% for \nroads, 1.1% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \n2.  Recent  Developments.  To  improve  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \nbottlenecks  that  constrain  efficient  economic  development,  the  Government  increased \ninvestment in transport infrastructure in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996\u20132000) and the Tenth \nFive-Year Plan (2001\u20132005). Investment in transport infrastructure as a share of gross domestic \nproduct more than doubled in the last decade. A World Bank study1 indicates that total transport \ninvestment should be increased to at least 3.8% of gross domestic product to avoid economic \ncosts associated with transport constraints. To meet the increase in transport demand, more \ninfrastructure investments are needed. The Government continues to accord high priority to \ntransport.  Substantial  investments  in  the  road  and  railway  sectors  from  both  domestic  and \ninternational financing sources, including the private sector, are envisaged in the 11th Five-Year \nPlan (2006\u20132010), which is currently under preparation. \n \n3.  Future Development Priorities and Outlook. The 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) \nidentified  transportation,  including  railway  development,  as  a  priority.  The  plan  envisaged \n(i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide access to unserved areas with the network \nlength  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km;  (ii) providing  3,000 km  of  double  lines  and \nelectrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity; and (iii) increasing operating speeds on \n5,000 km  with  the  total  length  of  such  lines  reaching  15,000 km.  A  total  investment  of \nCNY350 billion, including CNY270 billion on capital construction and CNY80 billion for rolling \nstock, was planned for the railway sector. By the end of 2005, a total investment of CNY308 \nbillion for capital construction was made for constructing 6,458 km of new lines, providing 3,725 \nkm of double lines and electrifying 6,259 km of tracks. During 2003\u20132007, investments for \ncapital construction are expected to reach CNY450 billion. The 11th Five-Year Plan continues to \nlay emphasis on railway development. \n \n4.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (up to 2020). The \nplan seeks to expand the railway network from 74,000 km in 2004 to 85,000 km by 2010, and to \n100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is a major goal. Train speed will be raised to over \n200 km per hour on the trunk network by 2020. Priority will be given to developing railways in \nunserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed.

The  plan  also  calls  for  separating  passenger  and  freight  traffic  in  heavily \ntrafficked corridors and 12,000 km of passenger dedicated corridor will be developed by 2020. \n \n5.  Other Development Partner Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation has provided \u00a5578 billion for 15 railway projects to \nexpand rail transport capacity, particularly in major coal transport corridors. It has also financed \ndevelopment of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, the \nWorld Bank has provided 10 loans totaling $2.4 billion for nine national railway projects and one \nlocal railway project. \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Experience \n \n6.  Assistance  in  the  Sector.  ADB  has  focused  on  improving  infrastructure  in  less-\ndeveloped and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. Since \n1989, ADB has provided 13 loans totaling about $2.6 billion to help finance the construction of \n1,921 km of new railway lines under eight local railway projects, and 4,597 km of new railway \nlines under four national railway projects. These projects have introduced modern technology \nand improved the efficiency of railway operation through institutional and structural reforms. \nADB also provided 11 technical assistance initiatives totaling about $5 million to promote the \ncommercial operation of railways, establish corporate governance, achieve cost recovery, and \nimprove railway management.  \n \n7.  Evaluation  of  Assistance.  Experience  from  completed  and  ongoing  ADB-financed \nrailway projects in the PRC shows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of \nthe executing agencies for project implementation. The speed of implementation has often \nexceeded expectation at the time of appraisal. The executing agencies generally complied with \nthe  loan  covenants.  Resettlement  and  environmental  management  were  carried  out \nsatisfactorily. Audited financial statements were submitted in a timely manner, and the audited \nfinancial statements were found generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 13 railway projects, 8 are \ncomplete, 2 started trial operation, and 3 are under implementation. The key lessons highlight \nthe  need  to  (i) ensure  that  the  executing  agency  established  for  project  processing  and \nimplementation  has  adequate  capacity;  (ii) prepare  realistic  traffic  forecasts;  (iii) review \nconstraints to traffic on a network basis, and the impact on project viability of the existing and/or \nplanned  railway  lines  and  other  transportation  modes  that  may  compete  with  the  project \nfacilities; and (iv) finance railway projects with appropriately determined debt-equity ratios. The \nrailway projects have contributed to a dramatic transformation of local economies. Per capita \nrural incomes in project areas increased substantially. Living standards were raised and poverty \nreduced. The project performance audit report2 for the ADB-financed Jing\u2013Jiu railway project in \nthe PRC concluded that the project was successful and exceeded its original passenger traffic \nforecasts. \n \nC.  ADB Strategy \n \n8.  Strategy and Priorities. ADB strategy for the railway sector has three broad objectives: \n(i) improve economic efficiency, (ii) promote growth in poor inland provinces to reduce poverty, \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002. Project Performance Audit Report on the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway Technical Enhancement Project in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. Manila.  \n ", "Appendix 3  31 \nand  (iii) protect  the  environment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of  these  three \nobjectives, the strategy supports developing efficient and integrated transport networks to meet \nthe needs of a growing market economy and contribute to reducing poverty through investment \ntargeting poorer areas, coupled with policy and institutional reforms. Because of the importance \nof railway transport for the development of the national economy, ADB strategy for the railway \nsector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system by constructing new lines in unserved areas \nthat  are  less  developed  and  poor,  (ii) modernizing  and increasing  the  capacity  to  improve \ntransport efficiency on key routes of the national railway system, (iii) commercializing railway \noperations to sustain efficient operations, and (iv) increasing railway competitiveness in the \ntransport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \n9.  Poverty  Reduction. ADB focuses on four issues to enhance the poverty reduction \nimpacts of transport investments: (i) locating ADB-financed projects in less-developed and poor \nregions where new lines will stimulate economic development, (ii) encouraging maximization of \nemployment  of  poor  people  during  project  construction  and  operation,  (iii) supplying  local \nmaterials  that  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and  economy  from  poor  villages,  and \n(iv) providing station access roads and link roads to widen project benefits to poor interior areas. \n \n10.  Governance and Policy Reform Agenda. The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \nsector  is  contributing  to  restructuring  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  commercializing \noperations,  supporting  management  autonomy  of  railway  operations,  developing  human \nresources, and improving financial management and accounting systems. \n \n11.  Promoting Private Sector Development. The PRC\u2019s large infrastructure needs require \nlocal governments to shift from traditional financing modes to the capital markets. In the railway \nsector, a wider role for the private sector is envisaged. MOR has taken steps to create the \nconditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment and private sector sources. Possible areas include construction of industrial \nsidings, commercial services, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12.  Regional Cooperation. The PRC is an active participant in three regional cooperation \ninitiatives:  (i) through  Yunnan  and  Guangxi  province  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion, \n(ii) through  the  Xinjiang  Autonomous  Region  for  the  Central  Asian  republics  initiative,  and \n(iii) through Inner Mongolia with Mongolia. The improvement of cross-border trade regimes is a \ncommon feature of these initiatives. Since these programs involve the poorer areas of the PRC, \nexpanding regional markets and options could help reduce poverty. An agreement for facilitating \nthe  cross-border  movement  of  goods  and  people  has  been  developed  under  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion initiative. Steps are being taken to develop an institutional framework to \nfacilitate the implementation of regional transport projects, e.g., Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz Republic\u2013\nPRC railway development and the Pan-Asian railway project (Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link \nproject). \n \nD.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  Monitoring Targets, Indicators, Modality, and Processes. The Government monitors \nand evaluates sector performance annually; these are reviewed by ADB through the process of \nthe  country  partnership  strategy.  Indicators  for  evaluating  sector  performance  include \n(i) economic development and poverty indicators for the western region; (ii) transport density in \nrelation to land area and population; (iii) public and private investment in railways; (iv) transport \ndemand for freight and passengers with modal split data; (v) level of user charges (railway \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nconstruction  surcharges,  etc.);  and  (vi) cross-border  traffic  volumes  with  the  Central  Asian \nrepublics, Greater Mekong Subregion, and Mongolia. \n \nTable A3: Railway Sector Road Map \n \n  Indicators \nItem \n \n1999  2005  2010 \nA.

Traffic Forecast \n \n1.  The  Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei  Railway  (TZR)  is  an  integral  part  of  the  east\u2013west  railway \nnetwork of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The Project will enhance the capacity for \nrailway transportation of both passengers and freight along the east\u2013west railway corridor. \n \n2.  Freight traffic for the TZR was forecast by commodity (i.e., coal, petroleum products, iron \nand  steel,  fertilizers,  intermodal  containers,  and  other  commodities)  in  two  categories \ndifferentiated by their economic impact: (i) traffic diverted from other modes, mainly from other \nnational railway routes and roads, based on an assessment of the relative service and cost \ncompetitiveness of the TZR; and (ii) generated traffic that would only move because of the \nexistence of a railway line where none previously existed. The traffic forecast was based on a \ntwo-tier  analysis:  (i)  national  transport  demand  based  on  historical  trends  correlating \nsocioeconomic parameters, such as gross domestic product (GDP) and propensity to travel to \ndemand for railway transport; and (ii) national and regional railway traffic demand based on \ncommodity-specific analysis for major commodities currently using other railway lines. 1 Traffic \nprojections considered expected economic growth, population increase, tourism development \npotential, local government development plans, market surveys, and assessments of technical \nassistance (TA) consultants and Asian Development Bank (ADB) missions. The freight volume \non the TZR is forecast to increase from about 22.22 billion ton-km in 2012 to 73.19 billion ton-\n \nkm in 2031, with an average annual growth rate of 6.5%.Passenger traffic is forecast to grow \nfrom 1.89 billion passenger-km in 2012 to 5.93 billion passenger-km in 2031, with an average \nannual growth rate of 6.2% (Table A13.1). \n \n3.  Transportation improvement will facilitate the development of natural resources and \nassociated industries. Local governments are seeking private sector companies to invest in their \nareas, particularly in manufacturing and tourism. Freight and passenger traffic forecasts are \nconsidered reasonable given that (i) the alternative railway lines (Baolan and Longhai lines) are \nhighly congested; (ii) railways in the PRC have experienced high annual traffic growth with \nrecent rates higher than the assumed growth rates for freight and passenger traffic; (iii) the \nProject is a critical link connecting the western PRC with the east, as well as serving as a \ngateway to the PRC\u2013Eurasian rail network for intermodal transport (footnote 1); (iv) the existing \nparallel road within the project corridor is severely congested making road transport expensive \nand hazardous; and (v) the distance saved by routing traffic through TZR compared to other \nrailway lines is about 100\u2013500 km in origin-destination pairs involving long-distance movement \nbetween the eastern and western PRC.  \n \nB.   Economic Evaluation  \n4.  Cost. The economic evaluation is based on a comparison of with- and without-project \nscenarios, using constant 2005 economic prices. The project benefits and cost were revalued in \neconomic prices by separating the cost items into tradable materials and equipment, non-\ntradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were expressed in yuan using the domestic price \nnumeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow \n                                                 \n1  An International Union of Railways (UIC)-sponsored protocol was signed by 26 nations in Washington D.C. on \n8 April 2005 to establish seamless rail transport service between the PRC and Europe with onward transatlantic \nmarine service to the eastern United States. Trial dispatch of containers along this route started in the third quarter \nof 2005. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 13 \nprice was used to put an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages \nfor skilled labor since no clear surplus of skilled workers exists. A shadow wage rate factor of \n0.67 was used to convert the wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of labor. \n \n5.  Benefits. Economic benefits include (i) operating cost savings for freight and passenger \ntraffic, (ii) time saving in diverted passenger traffic from buses, (iii) generated transport benefits, \n(iv) tourism benefits, (v) avoided road infrastructure and maintenance costs, (vi) shipper savings \ndue to increased railway competition, (vii) avoided road accidents, (viii) pollution reduction \nbenefits, (ix) energy savings, and (x) national productivity benefits. \n \n6.  Alternative Analysis. Alternative transport modes and designs, particularly roads, were \nassessed  to  determine  the  least-cost  option  to  provide  sufficient  capacity  to  cater  to  the \nexpected demand. Building an electrified double-track railway in this corridor was considered \nviable to meet the anticipated traffic demand, given the railway network development, type of \ncargo and passengers, and energy efficiency. Eight alternative alignments were subsequently \nevaluated during the feasibility study for the following stations and sections: Taiyuan nan/Yuci\u2013\nQingxu, Fenyang\u2013Liulin north, Wucheng\u2013Yihezhen, Wupu\u2013Suide, Zizhou\u2013Dijian, Zhuanjing\u2013\nNiumaojing, Hongjingzi\u2013Honggouyao, and Zhongning\u2013Liujiazhuang. Criteria used for evaluation \nof each alternative included (i) railway length; (ii) cost estimates; (iii) length and difficulty of the \nconstruction of bridges and tunnels; (iv) construction period; (v) local government development \nplans; and (vi) environmental and social impacts, including resettlement.  \n \n7.  Conclusion.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  is  18.2% \n(Table A13.3).  Benefits  from  the  freight  traffic,  including  generated  benefits,  are  the  major \neconomic  benefit  (66.6%),  passenger  benefits  contributing  about  1.5%  and  other  benefits \ncomprising the remaining balance. Sensitivity analysis tested seven scenarios to assess the \nrobustness of the results of the economic analysis (Table A13.4). The capital cost would have to \nbe more than 146% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. \nConsidering the experience of ADB-financed projects in the railway sector, this switching value \nis unlikely to occur. ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC have not encountered major cost \noverruns, and the contract prices tend to be lower than estimated because the contracting \nprocess is becoming increasingly competitive. Freight benefits would have to decrease more \nthan 54% to make the Project economically nonviable. A 1-year delay in completion does not \naffect economic viability. Combinations of adverse effects of benefits and costs were also \ntested. The results showed that the Project would maintain its economic viability under plausible \nscenarios of variability. \n \n8.  The economic analysis was extended to quantify project risk and distribute project net \nbenefits among stakeholders. The risk analysis considered the distribution of possible values for \nkey variables, including capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, passenger traffic, and \nfreight traffic; and the probability with which they may occur. The results show that the EIRR \nwould exceed 12% with 98% probability. Distribution analysis examined how project net benefits \nwould  be  distributed  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  project  beneficiaries,  such  as \npassengers, freight shippers, labor, government, and economy (Table A13.2).

General  \n1.  The projected financial statements of the proposed Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway (TZR) \nProject  were  prepared  in  current  terms  for  2006\u20132031.  Construction  will  be  completed  in \nJune 2011,  the  trial  operation  will  follow  for  1  year,  and  full  commercial  operations  will \ncommence in July 2012. The cost estimates are presented in current terms. As required in the \nfinancial management guidelines, physical contingencies (5.6%) and price contingencies1 have \nbeen provided.  \nB.   Financial Projections  \n2.  A set of tariffs was devised for freight and passenger transport service, based on full \ncost recovery plus an adequate return on equity. Operating revenues from tariffs are projected \nbased on forecast of future traffic and a base average tariff rate of CNY0.1097 per ton-kilometer \n(km) for 2012, inclusive of Railway Construction Fund collections which average CNY0.033 per \nton-km. A set of tariffs was devised based on full cost of recovery plus an adequate return on \nequity, to achieve close to optimum financial and economic performance of passenger traffic \noperating for the transit (CNY 0.025), interline (CNY0.020), and local (CNY 0.010) traffic with \ndue consideration for affordability. The tariff adjustment will take place once every 5 years to \nkeep up with inflation. No real increase in tariffs is expected to occur over the Project\u2019s life span. \nOther revenues\u2014including loading and unloading, warehouse storage, and parcel service in \ntrain stations\u2014amount to 4.5% of passenger revenue.   \n3.  Annual  incremental  operating  costs  are  estimated  as  follows:  (i)  fixed  cost  of \nCNY344,100 per route-km in 2012, excluding depreciation, increasing at an average rate of \n2.1% per year in current terms; (ii) passenger variable cost of CNY0.0537 per passenger-km in \n2012, excluding dry lease of rolling stock, increasing to CNY0.0603 per passenger-km in 2031; \n(iii) freight variable cost of CNY0.0306 per ton-km in 2012, excluding dry lease of rolling stock, \nincreasing to CNY0.0374 per ton-km in 2031; (iv) estimated cost of dry lease of rolling stock2 is \nCNY10.60 per train-km for passenger trains and CNY7.89 per train-km for freight trains; and \n(v) other  nonoperating  expenses  are  assumed  at  CNY0.0025  per  traffic  unit  (ton-km  plus \npassenger-km). All incremental operating costs are projected to increase annually in line with \ninflation rates.  \n4.  Periodic track-laying maintenance and infrastructure rehabilitation will be required after \n7 years of operation at a cost of CNY0.97 million per route-km. Electric power and catenary will \nbe  replaced  after  15  years  of  operation  at  a  cost  of  CNY1.800  billion.  Signaling  and \ncommunications, safety, and other equipment will be replaced after 20 years of operation at a \ncost of CNY1.712 billion.  \n5.  The accounts receivable turnover period is assumed at 2 months of the annual revenue \nand 1 month of the total working expenses for accounts payable. The Project Company will \n                                                 \n1  The local inflation rate is 3.3% for 2006 and 3.2% for 2007, and 3% thereafter; the foreign inflation rate is 2.8% for \n2006 and 1.9% thereafter. \n2  Rolling stock consists of a fleet of freight and passenger trains, which will not be specifically assigned to the TZR. \nMOR will separately finance the procurement of rolling stock and charge a fee based on train-kilometer (km) to \nTZR and other railways. The per-km rate will be based on dry-lease terms and will include depreciation charges \n(20-year economic life with 4% scrap value) and 8% return on investment. \n \n ", "50  Appendix 14 \nemploy 8,954 employees in 2012 (9.5 per route-km). The average annual wages and fringe \nbenefits in 2012 are CNY30,000, escalating at 3% per year.   \n6.  Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line method with an average life of 65 years for \nthe main railway structure, 10 years for track, 45 years for buildings, 15 years for electric power \nand traction, and 20 years for signaling and communications and safety and other equipment \nand facilities. Applicable business taxes at an average rate of 3.24% are charged on revenue. \nCorporate income tax at 33% is paid on income after deducting business taxes, depreciation \nand interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year losses carried forward.   \n7.  The Project will be funded 35% by equity and 65% by long-term loans. The China \nDevelopment Bank (CDB) loan will be repayable over 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. \nThe maturity of the China Construction Bank (CCB) loan is 15 years, including grace period. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan will have a 26-year term, including a 6-year grace \nperiod, and be a US dollar London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan with a 0.75% \ncommitment  fee.  Projected  financial  statements  are  in  Table  A14.1  to  Table  A14.3  The \nprojected financial statements indicate that the forecast revenue under the base assumptions \nare sufficient to cover annual recurrent costs; depreciation; debt repayments on the ADB, CCB, \nand CDB loans; and generate reasonable profits.  \nC.   Financial Analysis   \n8.  The major assumptions used for calculation of a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nare (i) all calculations are based on 2005 prices, covering 2006\u20132031; (ii) capital costs include \nall incremental capital expenditures related to construction and equipment for the railway, but \nexclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) operating costs include all \nannual incremental expenses incurred in operating the project railway, but exclude depreciation \nand debt repayment provisions; and (iv) the residual value equal to one-third of the net book \nvalue of capital investment.   \n9.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after tax, in real terms was \ncalculated using estimated capital mix and cost of funds. Costs have been considered as \nfollows: (i) the applicable 5-year LIBOR (London interbank offered rate) fixed swap rate plus a \nprovision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% with a rebate of 20 basis points is used for ADB debt, (ii) the \nestimated interest rate of 5.508% per annum is used for the CDB and CCB loans, and (iii) the \nopportunity cost of equity capital was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted to \nreflect the impact of income tax of 33%. The nominal cost is converted to the real cost by \napplying domestic long-term inflation rates for local currency and international long-term inflation \nrates for foreign exchange denominated debt.   \n10.  The FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 8.4% (Table A14.4), which \ncompares favorably with the WACC, computed at an after-tax basis at 2.21%. The Project is \nconsidered both financially viable  and sustainable. Sensitivity tests indicate that conditions \ncausing the Project's viability to fall below the WACC are unlikely to occur. The sensitivity of the \nProject's financial indicators to cost and revenue variations is in Table A14.5. \n ", "  51\n  Table 14.1: Projected Income Statements of the Project Company \n(CNY million,

The project railway alignment is 944 kilometers (km) long and will cross 3 provinces, \n7 prefecture level cities, and 22 counties and districts. The resettlement plan (RP) addresses \npermanent  and  temporary  impacts  caused  by  the  Project,  including  the  railway  alignment, \nstation  sites,  station  access  roads,  and  related  construction  activities.  An  estimated \n4,656 hectares (ha) of land will be permanently acquired, of which 42% is dryland, 36% paddy \nland, 8% orchard, 3% vegetable plots, 3% woodland, and 7% wasteland. Based on the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) standard for impact assessment, the equivalent of 11,803 people will \nlose all their land and agricultural livelihoods, and 11,956 will have their houses demolished. \nThe Project will also temporarily occupy 1,872 ha. An estimated 428,395 square meters (m2) of \nstructures will be affected, of which 81% are residential structures and other farm structures, \n13%  are  sheds,  5%  are  factory  buildings/workshops,  and  1%  is  school  buildings.  Land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts have been reduced by aligning the railway away from the \nmost  densely  populated  areas;  and  avoiding  villages,  cultivated  land,  and  facilities,  where \npossible\u2014based on consultations with communities and local government. However, the total \nnumber of affected persons is still large because of the long length of the proposed railway. \n \n2.  The Ministry of Railways (MOR), in consultation with provincial and local governments, \nprepared the RP based on the preliminary design; village surveys of 79 affected villages; \n1,319 additional household surveys; provincial, prefecture, and local government statistics; and \nconsultations with local officials, village leaders, and affected households. The resettlement \nobjective is to ensure that compensation and entitlements provided to affected persons are \nadequate  to  at  least  maintain  their  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  standard  of  living,  with  prospects  of \nimprovement\u2014in line with the PRC Land Administration Law, 1998, and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) policies on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples1. \n \n3.  The RP stipulates eligibility/entitlement provisions for affected people. Permanent land \nlosses will be compensated by land reallocation or cash payments. Each rural village will utilize \nthe land compensation and resettlement subsidy for income restoration. The main strategies for \nincome restoration include land readjustment, improvement of irrigation systems, development \nof animal husbandry and cash crops, small business development, and migration to urban \ncenters for employment. Compensation for temporary land loss will be paid directly to people \naffected to offset any income loss; the land will also be restored to its original state after use. \nCompensation for rural housing losses will be paid directly to those affected at replacement \ncost, free of demolition expenses and salvaged materials. The affected rural houses will be \nrebuilt in scattered locations within the existing village, so minimal site development is required. \nBetter road access and provision of site leveling, water supply, electricity, telephone, and cable \nwill be provided. Crop and tree losses will be directly paid to those affected and used at their \ndiscretion. Urban households, factories, schools and other institutions, and enterprises will be \npaid compensation at market rates for relocation and reconstruction. Urban households can \nselect new housing, which is widely available. Most factories will only suffer partial impacts and \ncontinue operations at the same site. For factories required to relocate, each owner will prepare \na relocation plan, which includes restoration of livelihoods and incomes for all workers. Schools \nand other institutions will be rebuilt based on the plans of local government, to ensure that \nservice levels are maintained or improved. \n \n4.  The resettlement impacts for the railway project are spread thinly over a long, narrow \ncorridor. Investigations showed that income loss from land acquisition is less severe because \nthis corridor is developing rapidly and at least 70% of net income for more than half of rural \nhouseholds comes from nonagricultural employment and small businesses. Special assistance \nwill be provided to any seriously affected villages and groups, especially vulnerable households \n                                                 \n1 ADB.  1998.

Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 15  55 \nthat include the poor, widows, and disabled persons. Ethnic minorities account for 9.6% of the \nproject  beneficiaries  and  all  are  in  Ningxia  province.  Some  of  the  Hui  households  have \nsuccessfully transitioned into the PRC\u2019s economy, while others have remained poor albeit with \nimproved living conditions. Where they are poor, this is due to the limited resources available in \nthe area to all residents and inability to take advantage of opportunities, which reflects root \ncauses of poverty rather than ethnicity. It is estimated that 300 Hui households will be relocated \nand about 4,300 Hui households will have partial loss of farmland. Special measures are \nincluded  in  the  RP  to  ensure  they  are  adequately  rehabilitated  and  their  living  standards \nimproved.  \n \n5.  Local  government  land  administration  bureaus  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nresettlement; many activities will be carried out by township officials and village committees. \nMOR and the local governments have extensive experience with resettlement. As a standard \nprocedure,  local  government  will  provide  training  to  local  officials  who  will  be  involved  in \nimplementation. The training will focus on ADB requirements, as specified in the RP, and new \nprocedures related to State Council Decree No. 28. Affected persons have been informed and \nconsulted about project impacts and resettlement policies and entitlements at various stages. \nDuring  the  preliminary  design  stage,  stakeholders  consulted  included  heads  of  affected \nhouseholds; village heads and representatives; local government agencies and departments; \nand  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  ethnic  minorities.  Resettlement  information \nbooklets were distributed to affected villages. Affected households will also be consulted and \ncan participate in resettlement activities, including the detailed measurement survey, location of \nunderpasses, new housing sites, and grievance redress. \n \n6.  Affected households will receive training and skills development assistance that will \nfacilitate income-generating activities. Other assistance\u2014such as preferential hiring of affected \npersons by construction companies and access to credit\u2014will also be provided. Local poverty \nalleviation programs provide a valuable source of additional assistance to vulnerable groups \nand they will be targeted during the implementation of the RP. In addition, the provinces have \nestablished programs that directly benefit affected villages and persons. Shaanxi has a very \nactive village development program that provides infrastructure and funds for rural enterprise \ndevelopment that will be doubled during the 11th Five-Year Plan. Ningxia has implemented a \nvillage relocation program that provides new and higher standard housing, infrastructure, and \naccess to services such as health clinics whereby local government provides 50% of the funding \nand the village supplies 50%. Similar support will be available to project affected villages, which \ncan use their compensation funds toward their 50% contribution to the program.   \n \n7.  MOR and prefecture-level land administration offices, in collaboration with the affected \ncounty offices, will be responsible for internal supervision and monitoring of compensation \npayments, house rebuilding/relocation, land redistribution, and grievance redress. MOR and \nlocal governments have extensive experience in land acquisition and resettlement (e.g., the \nexpressway now under construction that parallels TZR, and other roads in the area). This \nexperience will facilitate resettlement implementation for this Project. MOR will prepare progress \nreports and submit them to ADB on a quarterly basis, until resettlement is completed. MOR will \nthen prepare a resettlement completion report for submission to ADB. In addition, MOR will \ncontract an independent monitor to carry out external monitoring and evaluation. The tasks \ninclude  the  following:  (i)  conduct  baseline  survey;  (ii)  review  and  verify  the  compensation \npayments,  status  of  land  acquisition,  and  compensation  payments;  (iii)  assess  grievance \nredress  procedures,  affected  persons\u2019  reaction  and/or  satisfaction,  and  restoration  of \nlivelihoods; and (iv) compile lessons learned for future resettlement planning.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes   Yes \nnational priority in country poverty \npriority in country poverty analysis?       No    No \npartnership agreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nBetter  railway  transport  will  provide  an  enabling  environment  for  poverty  reduction  through  improved  access  to  markets, \nemployment, advanced education and medical facilities, new knowledge and information, families working or studying in other \nregions, and other social and economic services, and facilitation of economic development and job creation. Improved access to \nmarkets opens up opportunities for expansion of locally produced goods and services. Construction and operation of the railway \ngenerates additional employment opportunities in local communities, providing an additional source of income for people, including \npoor households in the project area. Incoming passengers and tourists generate additional demand for locally produced goods and \nservices. In addition, construction access and connector roads for the railway construction, and local governments\u2019 development of \nlocal roads from the stations to all levels of road network and poor villages will help extend the project benefits and opportunities to \nthe rural, poor communities by (i) improving local infrastructure; (ii) reducing transport costs; (iii) increasing access to markets, \nemployment, and other economic and social services; and (iv) improving conditions for economic growth shared by the poor. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nAreas along the alignment range from relatively well-off to some of the poorest in the PRC. The well-off areas near the termini of \nthe alignment have benefited from the PRC\u2019s recent economic growth. At the same time, many villages located toward the center of \nthe alignment have been isolated from these developments; this is where the very poor live. The links between poverty, topography, \nand transport systems are apparent in the project area. The main causes of poverty in the project areas are (i) natural calamity, (ii) \nlack of infrastructure, (iii) very limited and unsustainable source of livelihood, (iv) uneven economic development, and (v) poor \nhealth. The Project will benefit about 6.5 million people in the project area. Of this amount, about 70% are rural and 21.5% are poor \nwith a net income per capita of less than CNY900 in 2004 (nearly $1 per day using purchasing power parity exchange rate). In \nurban areas (2 districts), 5.8% are poor with per capita income less than minimum livings standards. The railway passes through 3 \nprovinces, 7 prefectures, and 22 counties. There are 1,527 designated poverty villages\u2014about 31% of all villages in the project \narea\u2014including 979,000 poor people (15% of total beneficiaries in the project area). About 9.6% of people in the project area are \nethnic minorities and almost all are Hui who live in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. \n \nAbout 435,000 unskilled person-years of work will be created during the construction of the railway. Half of the unskilled work will be \ntargeted at the poor, totaling 217,500 person-years at total wages of CNY1.631 billion or CNY7,500 per person-year. Priority will be \ngiven to resettlement affected people, women, and ethnic minorities. In addition, during construction, 80,693 person-years of local \nunskilled jobs will be needed for the provision of construction materials, with total wages of CNY605.2 million; it is anticipated that \nhalf of these jobs will be taken up by the poor. When the new railway starts full operation in 2012, an estimated 8,954 direct and \nindirect jobs will be created with total wages of CNY107.4 million annually; this will increase to 13,922 jobs generating CNY289.4 \nmillion in wages by 2030. The estimated construction tax revenue from the Project to counties in the project area is about CNY500 \nmillion. This additional revenue will be used for the range of poverty reduction and social activities, including mitigation of the \nnegative impacts on HIV/AIDS/STIs (sexually transmitted infections), human trafficking, and the environment\u2014with special attention \nto resettlement affected groups, women, ethnic groups, and other vulnerable people in the project area. The project\u2019s 41 new \nrailway stations will be connected to all levels of the road network accessible by all villages, including the poor, and will create \nvarious jobs to help distribute the benefits in the project area. There will be sufficient space in and around the stations for local area \ndevelopment; and the poor, women, ethnic groups, and other vulnerable people will be supported by local governments to sell local \nspecialties and other goods and services. Expecting more efficient freight transport and business journeys using the project railway, \nmany enterprises in the project area have been planning to expand their outputs and would increase labor by an estimated 52,437 \njobs as a result of the Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway (TZR). Revenues from freight traffic generated by the TZR will create 11,543 jobs \nin 2012 and increase to 36,454 jobs in 2030.  All these direct and indirect impacts of the Project will provide the conditions for the \nPRC\u2019s goal of micro-urbanization for poor families to (i) move away from unsustainable, mountainous, or desert farmlands; (ii) have \nbetter access to markets, and advanced educational and health facilities (especially for pregnant women); and (iii) build a \nsustainable future in new centers of economic activity, and complement local governments\u2019 poverty reduction activities to achieve \nthe goal\u2014such as assisting the poor with urban migration, relocation of poverty villages, employment, local economic development, \nfarmer-based  rural  tourism,  agricultural  product  development,  and  health  and  physical  infrastructure  and  natural  resources \nimprovement. These concerted efforts will promote further progress in the Millennium Development Goals, especially Goals 1, and \n3\u20137. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes                     No  \nVarious public consultation and participation activities have been conducted for the Project and the role of each stakeholder is \nidentified. MOR, Third Survey and Design Institute (TSDI), the project preparation technical assistance consultants, and ADB \nmissions have had formal and informal consultations with local communities and government agencies through meetings, surveys, \nhousehold interviews, written communications, and workshops, totaling 15,150 people (Appendix 7). The local county and township \ngovernments will be responsible for implementing resettlement plan, and organizing local labor for the construction and local \ndevelopment, especially near the new stations and ensure the participation of, and benefits for, the poor, women, ethnic minorities, \nand other vulnerable people. \n \n ", "58        Appendix 16 \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nLocal peoples\u2019 participation will be central for improving their opportunities to benefit from the Project. Local groups and relevant \ngovernment agencies will continue to be involved in the consultation and participation process, especially during implementation of \nthe EIA and RP. Railway Construction Support Offices are being set up in each project county, and will have copies of all relevant \ndocuments. During construction and operation, they will serve as a key coordinating point to enhance stakeholder participation, \nincluding the poor, women, ethnic groups, and other vulnerable people. Leading groups have been formed at local government level \nwithin the project area, including development & reform commissions, finance, land and resources, environment protection, industry \nand tourism; and they will include the offices of poverty alleviation, All-China Women\u2019s Federation, health, labor, civil affairs, and \nethnic and religious affairs as required\u2014to continue the process of consultation and participation and coordinate activities by various \nagencies to ensure local benefits. A social development action plan (SDAP) has been prepared and was endorsed by MOR and \nlocal governments on 1 March 2006. It will be implemented and monitored to ensure good participation of local people in project \nactivities and benefits. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAnalyses of gender-disaggregated data and discussions with representatives of the All-China Women\u2019s Federation indicate that \nwomen will need some assistance to fully benefit from the Project. Data collected for the poverty and social assessment and the RP \nindicate the following: (i) women comprise 49% of the total population in the project area; (ii) women primarily engage in agricultural \nactivities; and (iii) male members from poor households tend to travel further for migrant labor opportunities than nonpoor males, \nleaving behind a high percentage of households headed by women. Construction of the railway will create opportunities for local \narea development by (i) facilitating the flow of materials and information into the area, and (ii) accelerating the development of local \nindustry and tourism. Many service sector jobs that will be created by the railway development and the tourism sector seek women \nemployees. The All China Women\u2019s Federation will provide business management and financial assistance to women interested in \nsetting up small businesses that serve the construction crews and growing tourist sector.  \n \nPoverty and social enhancement measures have been built into the project design, and special mitigation (or protection) actions \nhave been included in the RP. For example, members of the community will collectively decide where schools will be relocated. \nWomen, especially female heads of household, will be consulted as schools provide an informal source of daycare for their \nchildren. Poor women will receive assistance so that their children can remain in school, thereby helping to break the cycle of \npoverty while freeing women\u2019s time during the day to work. Widows will be eligible for special assistance during land acquisition and \nresettlement. Women will be given priority for project-generated employment during construction and operation of the railway. The \nrise in female participation in the labor force and tourism market will increase women\u2019s net income, improving overall family welfare \nand increasing the status of the women.  \nHas an output been prepared?

The project area has much \nsmaller number of HIV/AIDS infections compared to other parts of the \nPRC.
