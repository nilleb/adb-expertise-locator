The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed to managing for development results \n(MfDR) with a focus on (i) building the institutional capacity and development of demand for \nMfDR  through  leadership  and  participatory  performance-based  planning  and  budgeting, \n(ii) strengthening data and information systems for monitoring and evaluation of results, and \n(iii) developing  processes  for  mutual  accountability  and  feedback.  The  Pacific  developing \nmember countries (PDMCs) recommitted to MfDR objectives during the 3rd International Round \nTable in Hanoi on 4 February 2007. Strengthening portfolio performance, which is historically \nweak in the region, is critical to achieving MfDR in the PDMCs. By incorporating an MfDR \napproach in portfolio management, ADB targets improved planning, monitoring, and evaluation \nof operations. Results-based portfolio management, in turn, calls for greater participation of \nproject  managers  in  results-oriented  strategy  and  program  planning,  project  design,  and \npreparation of design and monitoring frameworks.  \n \n2.  Achieving  MfDR  in  the  Pacific  requires  capacity  development  of  PDMC  project \nmanagers in setting the results agenda in the national development strategies and ADB country \npartnership strategies (CPSs). It also entails strengthened capacity to design results-based \nprojects  and  technical  assistance  (TA),  and  monitor  the  results  during  implementation. \nTherefore,  capacity  building  proposed  under  this  regional  TA1 (RETA)  project  is  aimed  at \ndeveloping  project  management  professionals  to  champion  MfDR  by  strengthening  their \ncapacity to foster commitment to results orientation in strategic planning, project design, and \nimplementation work. The TA will provide tools and skills to empower Pacific project managers \nto steer project implementation toward achieving tangible development outcomes set forth in the \nnational plans and CPSs. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  Pacific  (Table  1)  reflects  slower  than  average  project \nimplementation despite the presence of conducive factors to smooth implementation, such as \nhigh education levels.  \n \nTable 1: Project Performance Indicators for the Pacific \n2006 Indicators  PARD  ADB-Wide \nAverage time from signing to effectivity  5.7 months  4.5 months \nProjects with \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d rating  9.7%  3.0% \nProjects at risk  19.4%  10.0% \nProject implementation delays  41.9%  25.6% \nLoans with extensions  61.3%  29.1% \n                            ADB = Asian Development Bank, PARD = Pacific Department. \n                           Source: ADB\u2019s Central Operations Service Office statistics. \n \n4.  Project portfolio reviews have revealed operational reasons for the less-than-satisfactory \nperformance, including lack of (i) clear sector strategies; (ii) baseline data for the indicators at \noutcome levels across all sectors; and (iii) understanding and accountability for the country, \nsector, and project level outcome targets and input-output relationships. These reasons not only \nchallenge the ability to assess project and portfolio contributions to development impacts, they \nalso cause operational problems of slow disbursement, delayed implementation, noncompliance \nwith  covenants,  and  inadequate  project  input  delivery\u2014limiting  the  achievement  of  project \noutcomes. \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 August 2007. \n ", "2   \n5.  Portfolio reviews have also concluded that limited achievement of development results in \nthe region have stemmed from (i) inadequate involvement of government officials in identifying \nresults objectives to which projects contribute; (ii) limited capacity of project implementation staff  \nto participate in project design, resulting in weak ownership and understanding of the policy \naction  plans  supported  by  the  project  work  at  the  outset  and  during  implementation; \n(iii) inadequate use and knowledge of transparent procurement and disbursement processes, \nleading  to  delays  in  project  implementation;  (iv)  limited  project  management  skills;  and \n(v) limited accountability by the implementation team for the results targeted by the project. \n \n6.  Past project implementation training, while useful, has focused on input and activity \nlevels, primarily procurement and disbursement procedures. The Regional TA2 piloted project \ncycle-based project management training, and yielded immediate responses of satisfaction and \ninterest among the region\u2019s project management units (PMUs). Accordingly, the TA will adopt a \nmore comprehensive capacity development approach to generate understanding of the strategic \ndevelopment objectives, project level impact contributions, linkages between the project inputs \nand outputs, iterative and interactive implications of policy environments, and sequencing of \nproject activities as building blocks to attain the intended results.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  As part of ADB-wide effort to mainstream MfDR approaches,3 the TA will assist the \nselected PDMCs in  achieving sector objectives that contribute to national development goals, \nmeasured by attainment of the outcomes for the majority of ADB-funded projects. The TA \noutcome is MfDR-based project management for ADB projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA will assess project management capacity building needs by identifying binding \nconstraints  to  adoption  of  the  MfDR  approach  throughout  the  project  cycle.  The  TA  will \ncommence with surveys in PDMCs,4 selected on the basis of their ongoing and proposed project \nportfolios, that will identify capacity constraints in the critical MfDR areas. Subsequently, the TA \nwill design and deliver modular programs for skills development of all PDMCs with Project \nManagement  Units  (PAUs)  to  strengthen  ownership  and  delivery  of  results-based  project \nimplementation  to  pursue  MfDR.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  through  the  following  four \ncomponents: \n \n(i)  PDMCs\u2019  capacity  for  adopting  MfDR.  The  TA  will  survey  the  results \nmanagement  issues  across  PDMCs,  incorporating  lessons  from  experience \ngained by ADB in implementation of MfDR systems, to design capacity building \ncurricula capable of alleviating the binding constraints that impede adoption of \nMfDR  in  PDMCs.  The  TA  will  deliver  reinforcing  capacity  building  for  target \ngroups, including the management level, to develop accountability for MfDR-\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Institutional Strengthening and Building Capacity to Handle  Procurement. \n  Manila (TA 6164-REG, approved on 23 December, for $150,000). \n3  The TA will be implemented in conjunction with the TA6414-REG: Support for Results-Based Management in the \nPacific, approved on 19 October, for $1,000,000; TA6394-REG: Results-Focused Project Design and Management \n2, approved on 3 April, for $850,000; and the new generation of ADB\u2019s results-based Country Partnership \nStrategies prepared for the Pacific Region.  \n4  Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Timor-Leste, and Tonga. \n ", "  3\nbased  decision  making,  commitment  to  evaluation  and  feedback  in  planning \nprocesses, MfDR-focused project design and monitoring with the support of best \npractice tools, and MfDR-oriented project implementation with a focus on inputs \nand outcome levels. \n \n(ii)  Specific country capacity assessments. Country-specific assessments will be \nconducted for the Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Samoa, Timor-Leste, \nand Tonga in six areas of results-based (a) planning; (b) financial management \nand procurement; (c) human resources and civil service management of projects; \n(d) statistics;  (e)  auditing;  and  (f)  legal  framework  and  execution  and \nprocurement procedure5 reviews in a subset of PDMCs6 (including Fiji Islands, \nKiribati, and PNG). \n \n(iii)  Capacity for results-focused policies. Based on the above assessments, the \nTA will design a modular curriculum for capacity development to upgrade the \nPMUs\u2019 skills, covering planning for national development strategy objectives, \npolicy  results,  interfaces  with  project  contributions,  and  risks  and  mitigation \narrangements.  It  will  develop  the  PMUs\u2019  capacity  to  target  policy  outcomes \nthrough project design and inputs, and manage associated advisory TA (ADTA) \nprojects. The training will develop a clear understanding of the policy objectives \nand greater awareness of the role of the PMU. It will enable project managers to \ncontribute more effectively to the preparation of national plans and project targets, \npromoting a design of realistic and pragmatic development objectives that link \nwith sector and project outcomes. \n \n(iv)  Results-focused  project  management.  The  TA  will  build  on  past  project \nimplementation training for all PDMCs, adopting a project cycle process as the \nbasis  for  the  training.  While  concrete  project  management  areas  (e.g., \nprocurement,  consultant  engagement,  and  disbursement  processes)  remain \nimportant, the project cycle-based sequencing offers procedural problem-solving \ntools and skills for managers to strive toward results in each stage of the project \ncycle.  \n \n9.  The  TA  will  build  capacity  by  reinforcing  modules  and  a  dynamic  methodology  on \nefficient use of project management tools, ranging from mentoring arrangements to formal \ntraining events to develop a class of professional project managers in the Pacific. Capacity \nbuilding will be delivered over a 3-year implementation period, involving all PDMCs7 in (i) annual \nhub-based  results-based  project  management  workshops;  (ii)  a  workshop  for  finance \nsecretaries and ministers involved in project design and preparation; and (iii) establishment of \nan interactive help-desk and/or interactive website for project managers to dialogue on project \nissues and access tested solutions to problems. \n \n10.  Topics covered under the capacity development will include (i) results-based national \nplanning and development partner strategy planning and programming, emphasizing portfolio \nevaluation; (ii) results-based project design, with a focus on binding constraints, lessons learned, \nand project cycle interfaces with national results objectives; (iii) results-based country portfolio \n T  h  e    v i e  w  s    e  x p  r e  s  s e  d    h  e r  e i n    a  r e    those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n5m  Uemsinbge rAsD, BB\u2019os aCrda poafc Dityir eDcetvoerslo,p Mmaennta ganedm Genotv,e ornr asntaceff ,D ainvidsi omna\u2019sy  mbeet hpordeolilmoginya froyr  irne vniaewtu roef.  c ountry procurement \nsystems. \n6  Selected on the basis of on-going and proposed project portfolios.  \n7  Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New \nGuinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n   ", "4   \nreviews; (iv) results-based application of ADB procedures and use of project management tools \n(e.g., project administration memorandum, Loan Financial Information System); and (v) use of \ncountry  systems.  Competency  tests,  as  post-workshop  assessments,  will  be  organized  to \nmonitor  the  effectiveness  of  the  workshops  and  enable  adjustment  to  ensure  that  the  TA \nsucceeds in improving project implementation performance. Domestic post-modular training \nevents will be organized by participants to expand the benefits of the TA to a broader group of \nproject managers to achieve MfDR capacity development in the region. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $900,000 equivalent, of which $800,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nTA will finance four PDMC MfDR capacity assessments; three procurement assessments; four \nregional hub-based workshops; and proposals for user-friendly project management systems; \ninteractive helpdesk and/or website with 22 person-months of international and 18 person-\nmonths of local consulting services. The PDMC governments will contribute $100,000 in kind \nthrough the provision of office accommodation and transport. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years from April 2008 to March 2011. ADB will be the \nExecuting Agency of the TA. All PDMCs have been invited to participate in the assistance. \nActivities under the TA will only commence in a particular country when ADB has received the \nno-objection to the inclusion of the PDMC from the concerned government. The South Pacific \nSubregional Office (SPSO) will implement the TA in close cooperation with Central Operations \nServices  Office  (COSO),  Controller\u2019s  Department  (CTL),  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department  (RSDD),  and  sector  agencies  in  the  participating  PDMCs.  The \nministries of finance and their planning sections are the focal counterparts in the implementation \nof the TA. \n \n13.  International consultants, assisted by national consultants, will be engaged as follows: \n(i) an international MfDR specialist assisted by a national consultant for a total of 22 person-\nmonths (including about 2 person-months per country for five selected countries) to conduct \nMfDR  capacity  and  readiness  assessment  of  PDMCs;  (ii)  an  international  procurement \nspecialist assisted by a national consultant for a total of 12 person-months (2 person-months \nper  country  for  three  selected  countries)  for  analysis  of  procurement  systems;  (iii)  an \ninternational  facilitator  for  participatory  planning  and  management  training  for  a  total  of  3 \nperson-months (on an intermittent basis) during TA implementation; and (iv) an international \nprocedural  expert  for  3 person-months,  with  extensive  experience  in  ADB  project  approval \nprocesses. The international experts will be responsible for developing terms of reference and \nwork plans for the national consultants, in close consultation with SPSO and government focal \npoints. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  conduct  four  hub-based  workshops\u2014three  for  project  implementation, \nprocurement, and disbursement\u2014involving PMU personnel from ADB-funded projects in all \nPDMCs.  The  fourth  workshop  will cater  for senior  government  officials  heavily  involved  in \nproject design, including finance secretaries and ministers, as feasible. SPSO will facilitate \nthese workshops. The terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 3. \n \n ", "  5\n15.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  on  an  individual  basis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the quality \nand cost-based selection method. All equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and returned to ADB upon \ncompletion of the TA. \n \n16.  The reports of the consultant team will be in English, in publishable quality, and in three \ncopies. The consultant will also provide three CD-rom versions to ADB. Reports will include the \nfollowing: (i) an inception report that provides a clear work plan and methodology under each of \nthe  four  TA  components;  (ii)  a  midterm  report,  to  be  submitted  after  the  surveys  and \nassessments have been concluded, which includes curricula and organizational details for the \ncapacity building, an outline of training materials, and recommendations for the interactive help \ndesk and website; (iii) a draft final report; and (iv) a final report, covering all activities under the \nterms of reference, giving in full the training materials, including on CDs. The inception, midterm, \nand draft final reports will be reviewed in tripartite meetings between the consultant, ADB, and \nselected government representatives.  \n \nIV.
