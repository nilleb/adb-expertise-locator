The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is included in the 2003\u20132006 country \nstrategy program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for India.1 A fact-finding mission and a \nfollow up consultation mission visited India on 9\u201321 May 2004 and 1\u20132 July 2004, respectively, \nand reached an understanding with the Government of India regarding the goals, outputs, \nselection  of  states,  activities,  implementing  and  financing  arrangements,  and  counterpart \nsupport.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  The  North  Eastern  Region,  comprising  the  states  of  Arunachal  Pradesh,  Assam, \nManipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura, spreads over a vast expanse of \nover 260,000 square kilometers (km2) with about 40 million people.3 The region is characterized \nby heavy precipitation; extremely rich biodiversity; fragile hills; high seismicity; and a drainage \npattern marked by lateral valleys in the north and transverse valley in the south, dissected by \nhuge rivers and raging torrents. The northeastern states have suffered from lack of adequate \nroads, rail, inland waterways, and civil aviation to other parts of India, as well as poor municipal \ninfrastructure. These have contributed to poverty and impaired economic development. In terms \nof per capita state domestic product and other development indexes, such as power and road \nlength, the region ranks well below the national average. Nearly 32% of the region\u2019s population \nwas below the poverty line, which was higher than the national average (26%), for 1999\u20132000. \nThe region has been affected by insurgency.  \n \n3.  In  1998,  the  Government  decided  to  accelerate  development  of  the  North  Eastern \nRegion by annually assigning it 10% of Government budgetary support. Subsequently, law and \norder  significantly  improved  and  the  level  of  insurgency  came  down  in  the  region.4  The \nGovernment also created a focal point, the Ministry of Development of the North Eastern Region \n(MDONER),  with  the  mandate  to  coordinate  and  manage  the  flow  of  resources  and \ninfrastructure development by various stakeholders, e.g., state governments (state public works \ndepartments [PWDs]); central line ministries (the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways \n[MORTH],  Ministry of  Rural Development, and North Eastern Council [NEC]);5 and private \ninvestors.  \n \n4.  MDONER, NEC, and the northeastern state governments have generally responded to \nthe immediate needs of the region. However, the central level line ministries were either not \nable to spend their 10% fiscal allocations or implemented schemes of national importance, \nwhich did not always fully meet the felt needs of the North Eastern Region. Therefore, the \nGovernment decided that the funds allocated to the region would not lapse and the unspent \nmoney of about Rs10 billion ($216 million equivalent) a year would be pooled together for future \nschemes coordinated by MDONER. \n \n5.  The region's road network consists of about 145,000 kilometers (km), comprising (i) \n35,000 km of surfaced roads, which are mostly national highways, state highways, and district \nroads;  and (ii)  110,000  km  unsurfaced  roads.  The  network  is  characterized  by  insufficient \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002. Country Strategy and Program (2003\u20132006): India. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 14 April 2004. \n3  Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2001.  Road Development Plan Vision: 2021. India.  \n4  Some areas in Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Tripura still have insurgency issues that remain barriers to \ndevelopment, and the authorities are making efforts to overcome the problem. \n5  NEC comprises governors and chief ministers of all states and is currently chaired by the governor of Assam, with \nthe permanent secretariat located in Shillong. NEC was formed in 1972 and the Ministry of Development of North \nEastern Region in 1998. The latter oversees the activities of NEC. Both were originally under the Ministry of Home \nAffairs and they are under the newly-formed Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, after the start of the \nnew Government in May 2004.  \n ", "2  \ncoverage, weak pavement, poor geometrics, submersible stretches, poor riding quality, weak \nand distressed bridges. The network has more than 5,000 semi-permanent timber bridges \n(particularly in Assam, Sikkim, and Tripura), a problem unique to the region.6 Access to the \nregion from other parts of India is through a narrow corridor in West Bengal. \n \n6.  The Government recognizes the urgent need to adopt a medium-term plan for road \nnetwork development in the region. It is important to initiate systematic attempts to establish a \ncomprehensive database of the condition of the region's road network and current flows of \ngoods, people, and services from the region to other parts of India as well as neighboring \ncountries.  The  PWDs  in  the  region's  eight  states  have  very  low  capacities  for  planning, \nengineering, supervision, and monitoring of road development works. They are inexperienced in \nhandling  externally-funded  projects  and  lack  skills  to  undertake  detailed  project  report \npreparation and other investigations. Their problems are exacerbated by the lack of availability \nand capacity of local contracting and consulting services within the region. \n \n7.  The current level of maintenance is generally low in the region and varies widely among \nthe states, in terms of monitoring road conditions and planning for maintenance, allocating \nfunds, and executing civil works. The governments of Assam and Mizoram have made initial \nsteps toward setting up a road fund for maintenance.  \n \n8.  The  country  strategy  program  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  puts  special \nattention on the North Eastern Region, responding to the Government\u2019s request to help bring \nthe region into the mainstream of development. Increased focus on the North Eastern Region \nalso fits well ADB\u2019s efforts to promote cross-border regional cooperation, since the northeastern \nstates  share  common  borders  with  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China, \nMyanmar, and Nepal. In addition, the poverty impact of an integrated intervention in the North \nEastern Region will be high, especially in improving the road network connectivity.7 ADB's \nprevious state-level road sector operations in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh addressed \ngeneric sector issues and state-specific impediments to develop a reform agenda and policy \nmeasures to suit those states.8 \n \n9.   ADB has assisted Assam and Sikkim and is preparing an urban infrastructure project in \n2004 for the capital cities of the North Eastern Region.9 The World Bank has supported the \npreparation of strategic option studies for roads in Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura.10 The \nWorld Bank has also been funding state roads in Assam and Mizoram and is likely to process a \nsecond loan for the state roads in Assam. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) \nhas not been active in India\u2019s highway sector for the last few years. ADB has been in close \ncontact with JBIC to exchange information and explore the possible areas of cooperation in the \nNorth Eastern Region. The Department for International Development (DFID) of the United \n                                                 \n6 Nearly 70% of the roads in the region are in poor condition. The vehicle operating costs are high, signified by low \naverage journey speed of less than 20 km per hour, and high fuel consumption of 0.4 liters per kilometer (l/km). \nSource: MDONER. 2002.

", "    3 \n \nKingdom, an important partner in ADB\u2019s operations in India, has recorded its full support to the \nproposed Project. The Project will be prepared consistent with ongoing and planned activities of \nother external funding agencies. \n \n10.  The TA has incorporated lessons from previous ADB road sector projects. ADB\u2019s close \nsupervision and adequate consulting services during project preparation are critically important \nto (i) build the capacity for PWD staff and transfer skills for modern technology, and (ii) reduce \noperational and institutional constraints that cause delays during project implementation. The \ncomplementary role of the proposed Project with the activities under the ongoing West Bengal \nCorridor Development Project,11 which is the main corridor for port connectivity to the North \nEastern Region, as well as the proposed subregional transport connectivity project, will also be \ntaken into account during project formulation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n11.  The proposed Project will assist the states of the North Eastern Region to develop their \nroad network and establish reliable road connectivity to the national and subregional road \nnetworks and thus facilitate regional integration and trade flows. The Project will also build the \ncapacity  of  road  sector  institutions  at  state  level  and  contribute  to  effective  and  efficient \nmanagement of the road assets. The preliminary project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n12.  The main outputs of the TA will comprise (i) prioritization of national highways, state \nhighways, and major district roads to improve the national and subregional level connectivity for \nefficient flows of goods, people, and services in and out of the region; (ii) determination of the \nfeasibility of an investment project for improvement of priority state roads and bridges; and (iii) \nan  institutional  strengthening  action  plan  comprising  immediate  action  to  support \nimplementation of the proposed Project. The outputs will be reviewed and finalized based on the \nGovernment\u2019s priority needs assessment, ADB\u2019s focus, and projects funded by other multilateral \nand bilateral institutions in the northeastern states. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Prioritization. Taking the eight northeastern states as a region, the purpose of the \nprioritization program is to select roads (national highways, state highways, and major district \nroads that connect district headquarters to capitals of the states, and a few interdistrict linkages) \nthat  facilitate  regional  integration  and  trade  flows  to  other  parts  of  India  and  neighboring \ncountries. The TA will prioritize about 2,500 km of roads using simple criteria of road condition, \ntraffic, and connectivity.12 In undertaking this work, the consultants will coordinate preparation of \na database by the northeastern states, drawing on available data, and then consolidate and \nanalyze the data. The database will comprise simple mapping, inventory, and condition surveys.  \n \n14.  Feasibility  Study.  The  TA  will  prepare  feasibility  studies  for  improving,  with  the \napplication of modern construction technology to ensure all-weather connectivity, about 1,000\u2013\n1,200 km of prioritized state highways and major district roads, for inclusion under the proposed \nADB  Project.  The  feasibility  studies  in  states  like  Nagaland  will  also  evaluate  newer \ntechnologies such as the use of softer materials and treatment of side slopes to protect the \nroads in hilly areas from landslides. Economic evaluation will be carried out following ADB's \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor the West Bengal Corridor Development Project. Manila (Loan 1870-IND, approved on 5 December 2002 for \n$150 million). \n12 With the support of an ADB-financed staff consultant, a long list of about 4,000\u20135,000 km has been identified. ", "4  \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (February 1997)13 taking into account the \nremote locations of the North Eastern Region and low traffic volumes. In selecting the candidate \nroads, consideration will be given to the distribution of net benefits to the poor in providing \naccess to market, health, education, shortening of distances and reduction in travel times, other \nessential services, and improved road traffic safety. During project formulation, the Government \nand ADB will also consider including prioritized national highways under the scope of the \nProject. MDONER will coordinate with MORTH and the Border Roads Organization (BRO) on \nthe improvement of such national highways. These might be funded from the 10% budget \nallocations earmarked each year by MORTH and BRO for the North Eastern Region. The \nconsultants will also assess the potential for private sector participation through build-operate-\ntransfer or other arrangements.  \n \n15.  Environmental assessment will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy,  the  Operations  Manual  F1/BP  and  F1/OP  (2003),14  Environmental  Guidelines  for \nSelected Infrastructure Projects,15 and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003),16 and the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental policy and relevant guidelines. Social analysis will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Handbook  on  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis.17  The  summary  initial \npoverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n16.  Institutional  Strengthening.  This  component  will  have  a  pragmatic  rather  than \ncomprehensive focus. The TA will accomplish quick diagnostic reviews in each state, covering \n(i)  institutional  arrangements  for  national  highways  and  state  and  major  district  roads;  (ii) \ncapacity  for  planning,  engineering,  investigations,  detailed  project  report  preparation, \nsupervision, and monitoring; and (iii) availability of contracting capacity and consulting services. \nBased on the reviews, the TA will develop a simple set of options for institutional strengthening \nto support efficient implementation of the project investments. These outputs will become the \nstarting  point  for  policy  dialogue  between  ADB,  MDONER,  and  the  state  governments  on \ninstitutional reforms to be agreed during loan processing. The TA will include workshops in each \nstate to develop consensus on the institutional issues and options, and to support formulation of \ninstitutional strengthening action plans for each state. These outputs will be used to develop a \nframework for a more comprehensive medium-term institutional development program, including \ntraining needs assessment, and framework for training, under the proposed ADB advisory TA \nprogrammed in 2005.18 The proposed advisory TA is to be implemented in parallel with the \nproposed preparatory TA and to assist in the preparatory activities and advance actions for the \nproposed Project. The training and \u2018learning-by-doing\u201d exercises in the two TAs will also ensure \nthat the proposed Project is of high quality and is ready for implementation. The two TA study \nteams will interact to prepare appropriate reform programs covering the eight northeastern \nstates. The results of both TAs will provide the basis of the ensuing loan Project.   \n \n17.  The project preparatory TA consultants will assess the level of funding required for \nsustainable maintenance of roads assets, as well as prioritized roads, and the availability of \nfunds  at  the  state  level.19  The  consultants  will  propose  alternative  mechanisms,  including \ncreation of dedicated road maintenance funds, and will consider the option of MDONER initially \nhelping to meet the financing gaps at the state level. The outcomes of the work will be used to \nachieve commitment to maintenance financing during loan processing. \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 1997.

", "    5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total TA cost is estimated at  $1 million equivalent, comprising $386,000 in foreign \nexchange and $614,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government of the United Kingdom \nwill finance $800,000 on a grant basis, covering all the foreign exchange costs and $414,000 \nequivalent of local currency cost. The TA will be administered by ADB. The Government of India \nwill provide $200,000 equivalent in local currency, to finance office space, local transport, and \ncounterpart and support staff. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment has been informed that ADB\u2019s funding for the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing investment project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  A national steering committee, chaired by MDONER and comprising participants from \nMORTH, BRO, NEC, and the northeastern states, will provide guidance and direction to the TA \nconsultants. MDONER will also establish an implementing counterpart team for the TA and the \nProject, comprising at least one representative from each northeastern state. The team will work \nwith the TA consultants on a full-time basis, and the representatives will be drawn from senior-\nlevel  financial,  technical,  and  planning  experts  in  the  states.  The  TA  consultants  will  be \nstationed in the North Eastern Region.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 9 months, beginning in November 2004 and ending in \nAugust 2005. The TA will be carried out by a firm of international consultants in association with \ndomestic consultants, together with individual international and domestic consultants. The firm \nof consultants will include experts in regional transportation planning and transport economics, \ntrade  economics,  institutional  development  and  capacity  building,  road  engineering  and \nmaintenance, and traffic engineering and road safety. The individual consultants will include \nexperts in environment, resettlement, social concerns, legal issues, and poverty reduction. The \ninput from the firm will be about 11 person-months of international and 35 person-months of \ndomestic consultants. About 5 person-months of individual international and 15 person-months \nof individual domestic consultants will be required. Outline terms of reference and reporting \nrequirements for the consulting services are in Appendix 4. The consulting firm will be selected \nand  recruited  using  ADB's  quality-and  cost-based  selection  method.  Simplified  technical \nproposals  will  be  requested  from  the  short-listed  firms.  The  individual  consultants  will  be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.  \n \n21.  Workshops  involving  all  stakeholders\u2014central  agencies,  district  development \ncommittees,  private  sector  representatives,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other \ndevelopment  partners\u2014will  be  conducted  on  the  prioritization  program  and  the  investment \nproject at the inception of the TA, upon submission of the interim report and near the time of \nsubmission of the draft final report. Specifically, the TA will involve the relevant development \npartners during project formulation and will identify cofinancing opportunities during stakeholder \nconsultations for the investment Project. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, for preparing \nthe North Eastern State Roads Project and hereby reports this action to the Board.
