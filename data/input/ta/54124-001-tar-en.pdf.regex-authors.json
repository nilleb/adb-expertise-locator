This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will enhance regional health \ncooperation in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) countries and the \nCaucasus.1 It will facilitate regional policy dialogues, knowledge sharing, and a more coordinated \napproach to common health threats and challenges. In particular, the TA will (i) develop innovative \nsolutions in response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic; and (ii) build \ncapacity to jointly prevent, prepare for, and respond to regional health threats. The TA is a timely \nresponse to the COVID-19 crisis and likely future health threats, and builds on existing networks \nand projects in the region, addressing one of the main weaknesses\u2013\u2013sectoral and institutional \nfragmentation and uncoordinated approaches. \n \n2.  The TA is in line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030,2 particularly \noperational priority 1 to reduce poverty and inequalities, and enhance human capital and social \nprotection for all; operational priority 2 to enhance gender equality in health-related human capital \ndevelopment; and operational priority 7 to foster regional cooperation and integration and support \ninvestment in regional public goods.3 The TA will support the CAREC and Caucasus countries \n(footnote  1)  in  their  urgent  responses  to  the  COVID-19  outbreak  and  in  achieving  their \ncommitments under the International Health Regulations4 and the United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs),  particularly SDG 3, which targets to  achieve universal health \ncoverage. It will also support the implementation of the CAREC 2030 strategy to promote health \ncooperation.5 A regional cooperation operations business plan does not exist. The TA is proposed \ngiven the urgency to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Greater trade and transport connectivity in the region, while critical to greater integration \nand growth among the countries, carries the inherent risk of adverse public health impacts from \nemerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and transboundary animal diseases (TADs), if not managed \neffectively and collectively. Regional challenges call for regional solutions. The goal of better \nhealth outcomes can be achieved through more regional cooperation by leveraging economies of \nscale across different health system building blocks,6 through cross-sector collaboration, and by \nallowing for cross-country learning and information exchange.  \n \n4.  Human and economic costs of infectious and zoonotic diseases. Since the beginning \nof the 21st century, CAREC countries and the Caucasus have experienced multiple disease \noutbreaks caused by infectious and zoonotic diseases such as the severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The current COVID-19 crisis shows that infectious disease \n \n1  The region consists of the following countries: Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, Pakistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Key components of a well functioning health system. \n ", "2 \noutbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics have the potential to inflict catastrophic effects on human \nlives, and economies. The COVID-19 pandemic has already affected more than 180 countries, \ncausing more than 10 million infections and more than 500,000 deaths as of 30 June 2020.7 A \nrecent ADB study estimates potential losses of nearly 7.5% of gross domestic product for the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and 6.2% of gross domestic product for Developing Asia under \nthe long containment scenario where the outbreak lasts for 6 months, compared with a world \nwithout COVID-19.8 The pandemic further resulted in losses to tourism, businesses, and trade.  \n \n5.  High vulnerability to outbreaks and growing noncommunicable disease burden. \nEven though all countries in the region are successfully reducing their infectious disease burden, \nthe region remains vulnerable to outbreaks from epidemic-prone EIDs and TADs, as COVID-19 \ndemonstrates. While the COVID-19 pandemic arrived relatively late in many CAREC countries \nand in the Caucasus, the number of cases has increased rapidly in most countries, reflecting the \nregion\u2019s vulnerability.9 Factors contributing to the spread of EIDs and TADs include large numbers \nof people living close to animals; cross-border travel, including transboundary population and \nlivestock movements; economic integration and trade; and variable levels of health system \ncapacity. Greater inter- and intraregional population movements may potentially lead to the \nexclusion of migrants from access to essential health services, further exacerbating the risk of \ninfectious disease spread.10 In 2019, more than 10.3 million migrants from CAREC countries \nworked outside their home countries.11 The COVID-19 pandemic has also exposed the link \nbetween infectious diseases and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).12 This is concerning for a \nregion in which the NCD burden is high and continues to grow.13  \n \n6.  Weak capacity to respond to present and future pandemics. The increasing number \nof COVID-19 cases is placing countries\u2019 health systems under stress. More capacity to (i) protect \nhealth workers (of whom, globally, about 70% are women);14 (ii) identify, isolate, and treat severe \ncases; and (iii) communicate effectively about the risk is urgently needed. According to the World \nHealth Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Status, most countries in \nthe region currently fall under level 2 (up to 40% prepared) or level 3 (60%).15 According to the \nGlobal Health Security Index, countries in the region scored between 31.8 (Turkmenistan) and \n50.2 (Georgia) out of 100.16 Surveillance systems, for instance, are often still paper-based and/or \nfragmented, making efforts for early detection and monitoring challenging. There is potential to \ninnovate more and learn from the response to the COVID-19 crisis, and to leverage current \nsupport to build resilient health systems and better prepare them for potential future outbreaks.  \n \n7.

Effective regional cooperation that considers the \nneeds of the vulnerable (the elderly, women, children, and persons with disabilities) and of \ncommunities residing in border areas is essential for containing rapidly spreading cross-border \ninfectious diseases. There is scope to further build knowledge on joint regional mechanisms and \ncross-border  services,  and  identify  regional  investments  to  leverage  economies  of  scale. \nOpportunities for developing member countries to share examples of good regional collaboration, \nbrainstorm  workable  ideas, contribute to countries\u2019 national health strategies, and leverage \nongoing operations will contribute to building effective regional cooperation. It will be essential to \ndistill lessons and experiences from the COVID-19 pandemic when assessing the need for more \nregional health cooperation.  \n \n8.  Much potential to strengthen regional cooperation.17 Although regional agreements \nabound among CAREC countries, CAREC is the only body with a regional scope covering all \n11 countries. Other regional groupings like the Commonwealth of Independent States or Eurasian \nEconomic Union do not cover critical borders that are at high risk of zoonosis and epidemiological \nspread, such as the borders shared by the PRC with the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Pakistan. \nADB is in a unique position to provide regional and cross-border support as a partner for long-\nterm and innovative financing.18 It can build on ongoing health and TA projects in the region19 and \nleverage regional projects in other sectors for cross-sector collaboration.20 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: healthy lives ensured and well-being for all at \nall ages promoted (SDG 3).21 The TA will have the following outcome: joint approaches to regional \nhealth challenges strengthened.22 \n \nB.

For the pilots, a monitoring and evaluation plan \nshould be included to capture lessons learned and recommend options for rollout and scaling.25 \n \n11.  Immediate supply needs to respond to COVID-19 outbreaks may include forecasting and \nprocurement of items such as personal protective equipment for health workers, ventilators, \npolymerase chain reaction machines and related testing equipment, and other supplies to be \ndetermined in close coordination with governments and partners.26 The TA will support the \npreparation of knowledge products and help identify potential investment opportunities. \n  \n12.  Output 2: Capacity to prevent, prepare for, and respond to regional health threats \ndeveloped. The TA will further advance regional cooperation on health by drawing on lessons \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and results from the CAREC health scoping study. 27 The TA will \nhelp (i) scope and develop joint regional mechanisms, building on existing ones and those \nprepared under output 1 (e.g., joint procurement during crises;28 regional asset management; \nregional  surveillance  systems  for  infectious  and  zoonotic  diseases;  stronger  region-wide \nlaboratory capacities and referral systems; joint outbreak investigation); (ii) examine the potential \nfor  further  harmonization  of  standards  and  regulations  (e.g.,  human  and  animal  health \nmanagement and disease control,  reporting  procedures); (iii)  leverage  technology such as \ntelemedicine in remote and border  areas; (iv)  develop joint strategies to protect the  most \nvulnerable residing in border areas (women, the elderly, children, persons with disabilities, and \nmigrant and mobile populations) from disease outbreaks and improve their access to health \nservices; and (v) find solutions for better provision of cross-border health services. To this end, \nthe TA will support preparing studies, assessments, and reports; and holding consultations. \nCapacity development will be facilitated through workshops, and peer-to-peer learning through \nstudy tours and knowledge exchange, while ensuring women\u2019s equitable participation. In addition, \nthe TA will pursue collaboration with technical agencies such as WHO and the World Organization \nfor  Animal  Health.  National  action  plans  to  improve  national  capacity  for  regional  health \ncooperation will be updated or developed. High-level activities will be supplemented by evidence-\ngenerating national or regional workshops, joint simulation exercises, and impact assessments, \nespecially at border areas involving vulnerable communities. A virtual learning platform to \nencourage best practice sharing will be established and linked to the CAREC website.  \n \n25 The TA will draw on lessons from ADB. 2020.

It will build on findings of the CAREC health scoping study, national \n \nplans, and existing regional agreements. The strategy will address the main regional threats in \nthe  fields  of  EIDs,  zoonotic  diseases,  and  NCDs,  and  cross-sectoral  issues  of  migration, \nagriculture, trade, and climate change, including their gender-differentiated effects; and propose \ngender-sensitive approaches.

The Working Group on Health will \nexplore  ways  to  institutionalize  regional  cooperation  under  CAREC.  The  TA  will  provide \nsecretariat support to bring together relevant stakeholders and experts. A regional investment \nframework will be developed from 2022 to 2026 with project proposals to complement the strategy. \nThe  TA  will  support  preparation  of  prioritized  investment  cases,  including  public\u2013private \npartnerships, with indicative budgets, cost\u2013benefit analyses, recommendations for including \ngender elements, and various assessments such as those carried out under output 2. It will further \nsupport  consultation  meetings  with  public  and  private  stakeholders,  including  women,  in \npreparation of the strategy and investment framework. Exploring strategic regional collaborations \nwill allow to pool resources, build on existing initiatives and implement activities in the strategy.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,900,000, of which $3,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($2,250,000 TASF 6, and $750,000 TASF-\nother sources) (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Fund (RCIF), and (iii) $400,000 will be financed by the People's Republic of China \nPoverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund (PRC Fund) and administered by ADB.The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n15.  The RCIF will finance TA operational expenses in the form of consulting services and \nrelated goods and activities, trainings and conferences. The PRC Fund will finance TA operational \nexpenses in the form of goods.29 The RCIF funds are not used for (i) civil works; (ii) procurement \nof  large-scale  equipment;  and  (iii)  permanent  staffing  cost.  The  governments  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA and will be the executing agency. The Social Sector Division \nof ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants; facilitate the procurement of goods; help organize workshops; and closely coordinate \nwith the East Asia Department, Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division of \n \nCWRD and CAREC secretariat and relevant resident missions. Advance contracting will be \nprovided to expedite the mobilization of consultants. ADB staff will act as resource persons at \n \nworkshops, with travel costs charged to the TA. In each country, one or more departments of the \nrespective health ministry will act as implementing agency or agencies, as shown in the table \nbelow.
