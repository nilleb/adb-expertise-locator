INTRODUCTION\n1. In May 1998, the finance ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)\nmember economies1 endorsed the Financial Regulators Training Initiative (APEC Initiative) to\ndevelop regulators' capacities in the region. At APEC\u2019s request, the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB)  assisted  in  the  preparation  of  action  plans  that  established  a  broad  direction  and\napproach  for  sustainable  training  programs  for  banking  supervisors  and  securities  market\nregulators. Under these plans, two advisory groups2 and a secretariat for managing day-to-day\noperations were set up at ADB headquarters to implement the APEC Initiative. Phase I was\ncompleted  in  October  2000,  and  a  progress  report  was  submitted  to  the  APEC  finance\nministers. At their meeting held in September 2000 in Brunei, the APEC finance ministers\nrecommended an extension of the initiative and requested a continuation of ADB's advisory and\nfinancial support.\n2. Following the successful implementation of phase 1 of the APEC Initiative, ADB received\nrequests from the Australian APEC Study Centre and the Asian Development Bank Institute\n(ADBI) to support additional capacity building programs for financial regulators in the region.\nThere are strong interlinkages and potential synergies between the APEC Initiative and these\nnew  programs.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  finance  three  programs:  (i)  the  APEC\nInitiative, phase II; (ii) the Australian APEC Study Centre's three-year capacity building program\nfor insurance and pension regulators; and (iii) an ADBI capacity building workshop for the\npension subsector. By working on a collaborative basis, the TA will provide a more efficient\nutilization  of  resources  and  coordinated  regional  training  across  the  banking,  securities,\ninsurance, and pension subsectors. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.3\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. The APEC finance ministers have placed high priority on strengthening financial systems\nthrough  development  and  enforcement  of  standards,  codes,  capacities,  and  expertise  of\nregulatory  and  supervisory  staff  in  the  financial  sector.  To  develop  sustainable  training\nprograms, the APEC Initiative emphasizes improvements in training processes and programs to\nenhance the quality, implementation, and enforcement of regulation. The APEC Initiative also\nhelps financial regulatory authorities in APEC economies implement the Basle Core Principles\nfor Effective Banking Supervision and the Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation of\nthe  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO),  which  require  regular\ntraining to ensure that staff have the capacity to carry out their responsibilities. To date, key\noutputs of the APEC Initiative include:\n(i)  two regional seminars for national training managers to disseminate guidelines\nand best practices for management of training;\n(ii)  development  of  entry  and  intermediate  level  model  curricula  for  banking\nsupervisors and securities market regulators;\n                                                \n1 Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Chile; People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan;\nRepublic of Korea; Malaysia; Mexico; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; Peru; Philippines; Russia; Singapore;\nTaipei,China; Thailand; United States; and Viet Nam.\n2 One advisory group is for the banking supervisors program and the other is for the securities market regulators\nprogram. Both advisory groups have representatives from international financial institutions including ADB, the\nWorld Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.\n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 2000.", "2\n(iii)  two regional seminars for skills building for securities market regulators in priority\ntechnical areas such as enforcement and supervision of market intermediaries;\nand\n(iv)  establishment of a web site for the APEC Initiative to facilitate and strengthen\ncoordination among regional and international training providers.\n4. The regional seminars for securities market regulators and training managers have\ninvolved  almost  200  participants  from  APEC  and  ADB  member  economies.  For  example,\nparticipants in the July 2000 Regional Seminar came from People\u2019s Republic of China; India;\nIndonesia; Republic of Korea; Kyrgyz Republic; Malaysia; Nepal; Pakistan; Papua New Guinea;\nPhilippines; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Taipei,China; and Thailand.  Presenters included Australia;\nHong  Kong,  China;  Malaysia;  United  Kingdom;  and  United  States.  The  activities  have\naddressed gaps in current procedures and practices for training financial regulators in the APEC\nregion. Phase II will build on the regional network of training managers and the curriculum tools\ndeveloped in phase I, to help national regulatory agencies further strengthen their training\nprograms and promote the adoption of sound training practices. Intensive work is needed to\nbuild the training capacity and resources in regulatory agencies so that they become more self-\nsufficient in training their staff.\n5. Financial  supervision  is  becoming  increasingly  risk-based,  and  regulators  need  to\ndevelop sophisticated risk assessment skills for effective implementation and enforcement. This\nalso means changes to the regulatory and supervisory frameworks in line with the international\nprudential norms and internal governance policies. Sector reforms focus on moving financial\ninstitutions away from a closed, relationship-based system to a much more transparent, market-\ndisciplined  set  of  practices.  Implementing  these  reforms  requires  upgrading  technical\ncapabilities of regulators.\n6. While standard-setting bodies are making major efforts to strengthen standards and\ncodes  for  financial  regulation  and  supervision,  regulators  and  supervisors  often  lack  the\nknowledge  and  skills  to  effectively  enforce  the  regulations.  Further,  some  regulators  and\nsupervisors lack understanding of the linkages between the banking, securities markets, and\nother segments of the financial sector. In view of the trend in many countries toward financial\nconglomerates, governments are planning to address regulatory and supervisory issues in an\nintegrated and comprehensive manner. The capacity building programs will need to focus on:\n(i)  improving knowledge and skills of regulators and supervisors to support long-\nterm financial stability in the Asia and Pacific region;\n(ii)  promoting sound supervision and regulation to improve sector performance;\n(iii)  effective implementation and compliance with international best practices4; and\n(iv)  promoting  protection  of  stakeholder  interests  through  better  supervision  and\npreservation of assets to meet obligations to stakeholders and retirees.\n7. The APEC Initiative has launched a systematic and comprehensive training program for\nbanking supervisors and securities market regulators in the region. However, there have been\nvirtually  no  regional  efforts  to  coordinate  capacity  building  in  the  insurance  and  pension\nsubsectors.  For  both  economic  and  regulatory  reasons,  most  developing  countries  have\nunderdeveloped social security systems, and their insurance and pension subsectors face many\nfinancial and organizational problems. While a number of countries have initiated reforms in the\n                                                \n4 Covering eligibility for licenses, minimum paid-up capital, solvency and capital adequacy, governance, consumer\nprotection, supervision, enforcement, and regulatory intervention.", "3\ninsurance and pension subsectors, progress in strengthening standards, codes, governance,\ntransparency,  and  disclosure  has  been  limited.  Wide-ranging  reforms  will  deepen  financial\nmarkets, improve compliance with regulation and supervision, and bring about considerable\neconomic and social benefits. The development of insurance companies and pension funds can\ngenerate long-term financial resources that augment liquidity and depth of capital markets and\nprovide adequate and affordable long-term benefits to members and policyholders.\n8. Through its loans and TA programs, ADB has sought to improve regulatory oversight\nand  prudential  supervision  of  financial  markets.  Adopting  a  holistic  approach,  ADB  has\nsupported reforms of banking, securities markets, and the insurance and pension subsectors.\nADB has assisted in reforms of insurance regulations and supervision in Bangladesh, Bhutan,\nIndonesia,  Pakistan,  and  Philippines,  and  of  pension  and  provident  funds  in  Bangladesh,\nBhutan, People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People's\nDemocratic Republic, Thailand, Tonga, and Uzbekistan.\n9. The  TA  will  carry  forward  the  APEC  Initiative  to  broaden  and  deepen  the  training\nprocess and programs, building on the regional network of training managers and curriculum\ntools developed in phase I. The work with national regulatory agencies will be intensified to\npromote  the  implementation  of  stronger  training  programs.  The  secretariat  at  ADB  will\ncollaborate  with  and  support  programs  of  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements,  IOSCO,\nInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors, and other international organizations such\nas the Financial Stability Institute, Financial Stability Forum, and World Bank to develop regional\ntraining programs in the pension and insurance subsectors. Such collaboration and integration\non a regional basis will result in a more comprehensive and sustainable assistance for these\nsubsectors.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n10. The TA's primary objective is capacity building in financial regulation and supervision to\npromote the development of sound financial systems, effective implementation of regulation and\nsupervision, and compliance with international best practices. Regional and country-specific\ntraining programs, seminars, and workshops will be staged over a three-year period to ensure\ncomprehensive  coverage  and  to  provide  the  necessary  support  for  a  sustainable  capacity\nstrengthening. The TA will carry on the APEC Initiative sponsored in 1998 by the finance\nministers for capacity building in banking supervision and securities markets regulation, and\nbroaden the coverage to include the insurance and pension subsectors. It also will develop\nsynergies with international agencies engaged in capacity building and standard setting.\nB.  Scope\n11. The training programs will provide specialized skills and knowledge for 150-200 of the\nregion\u2019s  senior  and  middle-level  supervisors  and  regulators.  The  TA  will  support  three\ncollaborative initiatives (Appendix 2):\n(i)  APEC Initiative, phase II (2001),\n(ii)  the Australian APEC Study Centre's capacity building program for the pension\nand insurance subsectors (three-year program 2001-2003), and\n(iii)  an ADBI workshop and policy conference for the pension subsector (2001).", "4\n12. The training will be provided to ADB's developing member countries through regional\nand country-focused programs as needed and within TA resource limitations. Institutions that\nwill  benefit  from  training  include  regulatory  and  supervisory  agencies  and  self-regulatory\norganizations.  The  training  programs  for  item  (i)  above  will  be  developed  in  line  with  the\nprinciples, guidelines, and training processes developed under phase I of the APEC Initiative,\nand will be tailored to the level of the regulatory framework. The training programs will address\nregulatory and systemic weaknesses in banking, securities markets, and the insurance and\npension subsectors through high-level, regulator-to-regulator and regulator-to-industry dialogues\nand interrelated specialized lectures.\n13. The regulators will provide direct input into the structure and content of the training\nprograms, in which their regulatory officials will participate. The programs and workshops will\nsupport training programs to strengthen capacity for:\n(i)  enhancement of financial strength and stability of the various subsectors,\n(ii)  improving compliance, enforcement, and implementing standards and codes\nfor financial regulation and supervision,\n(iii)  protection of stakeholder interests,\n(iv)  adequate disclosure of benefit structures and risks,\n(v)  preservation of assets to meet obligations to policyholders and retirees,\n(vi)  fulfillment of fiduciary obligations,\n(vii)  independence and impartiality,\n(viii)  undertaking reporting and investigative activities,\n(ix)  due processes, equitable appeal, and redress systems,\n(x)  use of timely and corrective actions to uphold prudential standards, and\n(xi)  information technology issues in regulation.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,756,000 equivalent consisting entirely of\nforeign exchange. ADB will finance $800,000 of the TA cost on a grant basis from the Japan\nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The balance of $956,000 will be cofinanced.\nThe Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the Australian APEC Study\nCentre and some private sector firms will finance the APEC Study Centre program.  APEC will\nfinance phase II of the APEC Initiative and ADBI will finance the pension workshop and policy\nconference.  The  TA  will  require  about  22  person-months  of  consulting  services  from\ninternational  financial  regulation  and  supervision  experts  for  capacity  building.  The  cost\nestimates and financing plan are detailed in Appendix 3.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n15. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. An APEC unit was established in 1998 in\nthe  Financial  Sector  and  Industry  Division  (East)  to  administer  and  supervise  related  TA\nactivities5 and participate in APEC meetings. The TA will be administered and supervised by\nthat unit for continued coordination across programs.6 Capacity building activities will be jointly\ndeveloped with the Australian APEC Study Centre and ADBI. All consultants will be recruited on\nan individual basis and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.
