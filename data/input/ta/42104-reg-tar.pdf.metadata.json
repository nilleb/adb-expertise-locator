The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  actively  supported  regional  cooperation \nundertaken by developing member countries (DMCs) in South Asia for over two decades. Initial \ntechnical assistance (TA) was sought to help identify opportunities for collaborative work in \nenergy, environment, tourism, trade, and transport, among others. Although progress towards \nregional integration within South Asia has been made through free trade agreements, tariff \nreductions and cross-border infrastructure development, much more remains to be done. For \ninstance, major structural changes underway within the region are placing pressure on shared \nnatural resources, which require prudent management. \n \n2.  The pace of integration within South Asia appears to be determined by several factors\u2014 \nincluding carefully considered geopolitical strategies, perceptions of unequal opportunities for \nmarket expansion, and the need for mechanisms to manage the integration process\u2014all of \nwhich involve many stakeholders. ADB\u2019s South Asia regional cooperation strategy and program \n(RCSP) (2006\u20132008)1 recognized that cooperation, particularly on sensitive issues such as \nwater resources and the environment, would be difficult, and could serve as a stumbling block, \nimpeding broader negotiations. It therefore proposed an alternative called \u201ctrack II\u201d in the form of \nknowledge  based  cooperation  among  stakeholders  on  such  issues.  More  recently,  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 20202 points to the widening disparities among  DMCs as a serious development \nchallenge, one that is particularly evident in the case of South Asia; it emphasizes the role \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  (RCI)  can  play  in  reducing  such  disparities  through \nmutually beneficial use and exchange of resources, expertise and markets. \n \n3.  This regional technical assistance (RETA) seeks to address constraints to RCI in South \nAsia  by  building  knowledge  regarding  promising  areas  of  cooperation.3 It  also  aims  to \nstrategically strengthen partnerships between governments, research institutes, and the private \nsector within and across DMCs. The concept paper was cleared by the vice-president on 29 \nApril 2008. A fact-finding mission, conducted between April and May 2008, consulted research \ninstitutes, chambers of commerce and industries, and government officials regarding the design \nand proposed approach.4 The no-objection of South Asian governments5 to the RETA design \nwill be obtained prior to implementation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n4.  Development agencies, including ADB, have continued to support research institutes in \norder to enhance technical capacity for research to help inform both national and regional \npolicies. This investment has yielded good results; in the 1980s the Committee for Studies on \nCooperation  for  Development  introduced  groundbreaking  ideas  such  as  the  utilization  and \ntrading of hydropower resources in the Himalayas. There is now growing evidence of extensive \ninformal trade in South Asia that for some countries exceeds formal trade,6 and can thus provide \nan impetus for trade reforms. However, the ability of DMCs to reduce poverty through sustained \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006.

The Role of Knowledge and Partnerships in Accelerating Regional Cooperation. \nKnowledge makes an individual or an institution \u201ccapable of different or more effective action\u201d.8 \nStakeholder partnerships can play a critical role in pooling knowledge and resources across \ninstitutions and countries, and depoliticizing and influencing public discourse on sensitive issues. \nIssues related to knowledge and partnerships that arise in the process of regional cooperation \ninclude (i) the need for analysis and public engagement on the impact of regional cooperation,9 \n(ii) challenges associated with translating research findings into policies and actions, and (iii) \npoor understanding of the unique value that key stakeholders add to the process of regional \ncooperation through partnerships.  \n \n6.  First, research organizations have an important role to play in analyzing both short-term \nand  long-term  issues  of  regional  importance.  Although  there  are  several  well-respected \nresearch institutes in the region that have undertaken high-quality work that illustrates the \nimpacts of cooperation in trade, investment, and services10, their role as truly regional think \ntanks is still evolving. Several reasons for this were identified. Most importantly, there is a need \nfor long-term financing, to help professionals develop independent and credible research on \nregional  cooperation.  This  could  involve  building  regional  research  teams  that  collectively \nanalyze regional issues from the perspective of different jurisdictions and stakeholders and then \nidentify opportunities, as opposed to research that simply reflects national interests vis-a-vis \nregional issues. There is also need for systematic mechanisms that utilize research findings to \ninform decision making. Constructive and strategic public engagement by reputable research \ninstitutes may well serve to accelerate regional cooperation initiatives in South Asia.  \n7.  Second, translating research and analytical findings into actions in DMCs is challenging. \nAlthough support for regional cooperation in specific areas may be present (in the form of \nexpressed intent and high-level political will), cooperation can be hindered by differences among \ncountries in their ability to implement changes in policies, business processes, procedures, and \nin some cases legislation.11 For example, in the case of trade promotion, alignment between the \noperational priorities of the central and state and/or provincial governments along borders is \nclearly needed, and barriers to trade and investment need to be better documented and then \naddressed. Environmental changes need to be factored into technical specifications and capital \ninvestment costs. \n \n8.  Third, weak understanding of the unique value that each of the stakeholders brings to \nthe process of regional cooperation can result in less effective partnerships to address issues. \nResearch organizations can identify issues of global and/or regional importance, and provide \n                                                 \n7  DMCs must generate growth while adopting environmentally sensitive technologies, and also manage the adverse \neffects of environmental changes already underway. \n8  Drucker, Peter F. 1989. The New Realities: In Government and Politics/In Economics and Business/In Society and \nWorld View. New York: Harper & Row. \n9 For instance,  ADB\u2019s  South Asia Department has recently completed a joint study  with the United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development on the Quantification of Benefits from Regional Cooperation in South Asia. \nVolume 1. Benefits from South Asia Free Trade Agreement: Trade, Investment, and Transport Facilitation. Volume \n2. Benefits from Deepening Integration: Trade in Services.

New legislation \nshould be kept flexible to allow the executive to institute procedural changes in response to changing conditions.  \n ", "        3\nsupporting  analysis  for  policy  formulation  and  impact  assessment.  The  private  sector  can \nprovide  valuable  insights  for  attracting  investment  and  increasing  the  adoption  of \nenvironmentally friendly technologies. Governments can use the feedback and support from \nsuch  partnerships,  as  well  as  their  own  longstanding  experience,  to  ensure  that  regional \ncooperation policies and projects being formulated are realistic. They can also suggest practical \nways to further implementation of current regional cooperation initiatives. \n \n9.   ADB\u2019s South Asia Department has actively supported research on regional cooperation \nunder \u201ctrack II\u201d of its RCSP through TA12 supporting trade integration, investment cooperation, \nmacroeconomic policy harmonization, and implementation of a South Asia citizens\u2019 charter, \namong  others.  This  support  has  been  very  helpful  in  analyzing  key  policy  issues  and  in \npromoting partnerships, particularly among the leadership of regional networks, to carry forward \nanalytical work and influence public opinion and policies in the region. However, the magnitude \nof the challenges requires that assistance be increased and sustained over the long term. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  This RETA has been designed with four features to address the issues identified above. \nFirst, it provides researchers, policy makers and private sector partners the opportunity to \ncollaborate on areas identified as significant to regional cooperation. Second, it facilitates the \nexchange of strategies between South Asia and other regions such as the Association of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  where  RCI  is  far  more  advanced.  Third,  it  supports \nsystematic discussion on issues among senior policy makers to allow them to jointly identify \ninitiatives for regional forums such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \n(SAARC), the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, \nand the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation forum. Fourth, it aims to incorporate \nongoing research findings into ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with DMC governments and other key \nstakeholders. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The outcome of the RETA is strengthened knowledge-based collaboration among South \nAsian policy makers, researchers and private sector investors to address national and regional \ndevelopment issues. Better understanding of issues, harmonization of policies and collaboration \non common opportunities is expected to contribute to greater economic prosperity and stability \nin South Asia. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   The RETA is an umbrella TA covering four research areas identified by stakeholders as \ncritical to regional trade in goods and services and promotion of private sector-led development \nin an efficient and environmentally sustainable manner. Topic 1: Enhancing Supply Capabilities \nin South Asia, recognizes the need of less-developed economies to fully develop their supply-\nside capacity through productivity enhancement, innovation and efficiency measures in order to \nreap the opportunities posed by regional trade liberalization and access to cross-border markets. \nThe study will examine enhancement of the supply of finished and intermediate products, which \n                                                 \n12 For instance, see outputs for ADB. 2004.

The latter is based on the \nconcept of a research fund grant distributed on the basis of competitive proposals. Publications under TA 6189-\nREG are available at http://www.saceps.org/publications. \n ", "4   \nare key to the development of regional supply clusters.13 It aims to identify policy instruments \nand institutional and financing mechanisms that can encourage foreign direct investment, and \nexamine total quality management and the use of environmentally friendly technology,14 among \nother issues. Topic 2: Barriers to Intraregional Direct Investment, supports topic 1 by identifying \nspecific  barriers  to  investment  within  South  Asian  countries,  including  barriers  related  to \ncommercial and financial sector policies and regulations. Elimination of barriers may be crucial \nto realizing the true potential for intraregional investment and trade in South Asia, including for \nservices. Topic 3: Development of Initiatives to Promote Regional Trade in Services, recognizes \nemerging private sector-led demand for trading of business and professional services to help \naddress demand and supply imbalances across countries, especially for textiles and clothing, \nhealthcare, and education. The study will support initiatives focused on extending the South \nAsia Free Trade Agreement to cover trade in services. Case studies will be undertaken in three \nor four service sectors of priority interest to South Asian countries. Topic 4: Relevance of RCI \nfrom the Perspective of Less-Developed Countries, will review the gains to smaller DMCs from \njoining regional cooperation forums such as ASEAN and the European Union, and from entering \ninto regional trade agreements.  \n \n13.   The scope of work in para. 12 is based on a review of recent studies, but will be finalized \nduring the inception workshop to ensure that the outputs are strategic, add value and are of \npractical relevance to South Asian countries. Some resources have also been set aside to \nrespond flexibly to requests for information from governments during implementation. ADB\u2019s \nOffice of Regional Economic Integration will serve as a resource for research methodologies \nand for interacting with the ASEAN Secretariat. \n \n14.  Output 1: Research and Feasibility Studies. Key activities towards this output include: \n(i) an inception workshop to finalize scope of work, timeline and deliverables (September\u2013\nOctober  2008);  (ii)  identification  of  the  membership  and  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  of  the \ntechnical working group (September\u2013October 2008); (iii) preparation of research studies, and \nworkshops15 to determine methodologies, conduct surveys, and analyze data (October 2008\u2013\nDecember 2009).  \n \n15.

The findings will also support ADB\u2019s policy dialogue on \nregional cooperation; (iv) presentation of findings at regional cooperation events organized by \nthe public and private sectors (summer 2010); and (v) finalization and dissemination of reports \n(May\u2013August 2010). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $700,000 and will be financed on a grant \nbasis from the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, which will be implemented over 24 \nmonths from September 2008 to August 2010. The Research and Information System for \nDeveloping Countries (RIS), India, has been identified as the consultant and will be engaged \nthrough single source selection.18 RIS will draw on its own staff and research associates in \nSouth Asia to develop research teams. RIS shares ADB\u2019s vision and commitment regarding \nregional cooperation. It has stimulated policy dialogue on significant issues such as trade in \nservices, energy security, and foreign direct investment at high-level forums in South Asia and \nEast Asia, and brings this exceptional experience to the RETA. A time-based contract approach \nwill be used, with payments based on satisfactory quality of deliverables.  \n \n18.  A technical working group composed of eminent experts from participating South Asian \ncountries, the private sector, and ADB will oversee RETA implementation. The research will be \nundertaken  by  a  team  of  national  consultants  (100  person-months).  An  international \ndevelopment specialist (6 person-months), and a national consultant (12 person-months) will be \nrecruited by ADB to oversee research quality and support management, coordination, and TA \nadministration, respectively. \n \n19.  The terms of reference (TOR) for RIS and the consultants are outlined in Appendix 3. \nOnce the scope of the research is finalized during the inception workshop, specific TORs and \nsubcontracts with individual researchers will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). No equipment will be procured \nunder the RETA. To facilitate implementation, an advance payment facility will be used in line \nwith the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation \nand Integration Financing Partnership Facility for Strategic Partnerships for Policy Development \nand Action to Foster Regional Cooperation in South Asia, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                                 \n18 RIS is (i) a well-established institute with research and training capabilities in RCI; (ii) a core faculty with extensive \nwork experience on global RCI issues (available: https://www.ris.org.in/publications); (iii) strong linkages with \nresearch institutes and policy makers; and (iv) demonstrated ability to effectively disseminate research findings \nthrough seminars, policy briefs, and professional training. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nGreater economic  Increase in intraregional  Data on trade, FDI,  \u2022  Conducive legal and \nprosperity and stability in  trade in goods and  documents listing harmonized  regulatory structures, \nSouth Asia  services, FDI, movement  policies and procedures and  financing mechanisms and \n  of people, and sustainable  surveys of consumer and/or  technology that promotes \n  use of natural resources   firms.
