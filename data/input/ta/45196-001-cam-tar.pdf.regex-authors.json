INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Kingdom of Cambodia has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to develop its capacity for urban management. The TA will support \nthe  ADB\u2019s  broader  objective  of  sustainable  poverty  reduction,  as  stated  in  the  country \npartnership strategy (CPS) for Cambodia, by promoting (i) inclusive economic growth, through \ninvestments in physical infrastructure, and (ii) social development and equity, through basic \neducation, water supply, and sanitation services.1 Establishing urban\u2013rural links is recognized in \nthe CPS as an increasingly important challenge to address as part of Cambodia\u2019s development \nprocess. Urban development, through better urban management, and other community-based \ndevelopment initiatives in the Tonle Sap provinces will be mutually reinforcing. In fact, the TA \nwill  supplement  two  planned  urban  projects  in  Cambodia:  (i)  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \nCorridor Towns Development Project (for loan approval in 2012), and (ii) Integrated Urban \nEnvironmental Management in the Tonle Sap Basin (for loan approval in 2013). The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Recognizing the need to introduce new provincial, municipal, and district systems of \ngovernance, the Government of Cambodia has embarked on a wide range of subnational \ngovernance reforms. The two strategic goals are to (i) strengthen and expand local democracy, \nand (ii) promote local development and reduce poverty. The Organic Law, approved by the \ngovernment  in  2008,  was  designed  to  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  service \ndelivery by Cambodia\u2019s subnational administration through a hierarchical structure. The law has \na sub-decree that clearly defines province and district roles and responsibilities.3 The present \nadministration has vertical and horizontal components. The vertical component is the top\u2013down \nadministrative system with the municipal council and executive board of the governor being \naccountable to the higher (i.e., provincial) authority. In the horizontal component, the executive \nboard of the governor works closely with the technical line departments of the national ministries \nof various sectors, such as public works and transport, environment, land management, urban \nplanning and construction, rural development, health, and education.  \n \n3.  The creation of municipalities and the drafting of a national urban development strategy \nand national housing policy are major achievements. Despite efforts at the national level, the \ninstitutional framework and capacity for urban management remain very limited, especially at \nthe provincial and local levels, where the newly established municipalities are now beginning to \nplay an increasingly important role. Given the limited experience of municipalities and their \nseverely limited staffing, years of support and technical assistance will be required from both \nnational and provincial agencies to raise the capacity of municipalities to an acceptable level. \nCapacity  development  will  be  integrated  into  ADB-supported  investment  initiatives  and  will \nattempt  to  ensure  not  only  smooth  project  implementation  but  also  the  development  of \nsustainable institutional capacities. \n \n4.  An analysis of the constraints to growth in Cambodia, produced by the World Bank in \nFebruary 2009, identified three key challenges to rapid growth that need to be managed: \n(i) urbanization, (ii) inequality, and (iii) environmental concerns.4 While the government\u2019s policy, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2011.

The CPS also recognizes the importance of water \nsupply and other municipal infrastructure and services, and, therefore, supports lending to the \nurban sector in Cambodia (footnote 1). The ADB\u2019s Urban Sector Assessment, Strategy, and \nRoad Map for Cambodia emphasizes the need for capacity development in the urban sector, \ncovering sector institutions and local authorities.5  \n \n5.  In recent years, the government has been working on important legislation for the urban \nsector, which covers spatial planning, urbanization, land valuation, and housing policy.6 This TA \nwill  assist  the  government  in  consolidation  of  an  urban  development  code,  which  will \nsupplement the Subdecree on Urbanization of the Capital City, Towns, and Urban Areas of \n2011. Output 3 of the TA is specifically oriented toward this activity.     \n \n6.  ADB holds regular sector dialogues with the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, the \nAustralian Agency for International Development, the Export\u2013Import Bank of Korea, German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW, JICA, and the World Bank. Other development partners \n(like JICA) have invested in water, urban roads, and urban transport in Phnom Penh and have \nshown interest in solid waste and wastewater treatment in other towns. Both JICA and the \nExport\u2013Import  Bank  of  Korea  have  expressed  interest  in  taking  lead  roles  in  wastewater \ntreatment in Phnom Penh. The Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement has contributed to urban \nplanning in Phnom Penh and transport studies. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s recent urban infrastructure experience is limited to the highly successful Phnom \nPenh Water Supply and Drainage Project7  and the successful Provincial Towns Improvement \nProject.8 In contrast, the recent wastewater treatment plants in Siem Reap and Preah Sihanouk, \nconstructed  under  the  Mekong  Tourism  Development  Project,  had  problems  in  revenue \ncollection  and  sustainability. 9 Additionally,  small-scale,  community-based  solid  waste \nmanagement projects have been implemented in Phnom Penh. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  will  be  improved  urban  infrastructure  services  for  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. The outcome will be improved urban management capacity of the national, provincial, \nand municipal governments. To make this capacity development sustainable, the Ministry of \nLand Management, Urban Planning and Construction will be selected and strengthened to carry \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2012.

The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nemphasis on capacity development as expressed in the urban sector assessment, strategy, and \nroad map (footnote 5) and will help to ensure aid effectiveness.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Output  1:  Implementation  of  a  pilot  urban  management  capacity  development \nprogram. The pilot program will consist of a training needs assessment that will lead to the \ninitial design of measures for capacity development (e.g., training, systems development, and \nhuman resources development). The location or target of the pilot program will be selected \namong two proposed ADB urban projects (para. 1). Development of curricula, training materials, \nand  a  training  mechanism  will  result  in  a  pilot  training  program  that  will  consist  of \n(i) management workshops, intended for managers and unit heads at provincial and local levels; \nand  (ii) short  courses,  intended  for  technical  staff.  Management  workshops  will  be  geared \ntoward subjects that focus on project management skills, while the short courses will deal with \ntechnical issues. The capacity development  approach prioritizes process management and \nmaximizes existing skills and experiences, rather than duplicating the skills training programs of \nuniversities and technical colleges. The TA will develop the skill sets of promising junior staff \n(those with minimum skill sets) or excluded groups (e.g., female staff), and will enhance staff \ncapacities  as  part  of  the  government\u2019s  career  development  strategy.  These  capacity \ndevelopment activities are intended to focus on land management and spatial planning, project \npreparation  and  implementation  (such  as  subproject  feasibility  studies),  procurement, \nenvironmental safeguards (such as climate change adaptation), resettlement, operation and \nmaintenance, and project evaluation and monitoring. Preparatory work will include (i) a review of \nconstraints, opportunities, and practical limitations for female staff; (ii) an analysis of existing \nstaff  ratios  in  management  or  technical  position  of  local  authorities;  (iii) the  targeting  of \nparticipants  to  include  women  and  promising  non-managers;  and  (iv)  a  human  resource \ndevelopment plan to address challenges and limitations and to develop careers. \n \n10.  Output 2: Scaling-up of the urban management capacity development program. \nOnce  the  pilot  activities  have  been  completed,  measures  for  scaling  up  the  capacity \ndevelopment program will be prepared. The municipalities that will participate in the scaling-up \nactivities will be those covered by the Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns Development \nProject (Poipet, Battambang, Neak Loeung, and Bavet) and the Integrated Urban Environmental \nManagement in the Tonle Sap Basin (Serei Saophoan, Siem Reap, Kampong Thom, Pursat, \nand  Kampong  Chhnang)  (para. 1).  Experienced  urban  managers  from  bigger  cities  and \nprovinces  will  share  their  experiences  and  practical  approaches  with  the  managers  and \ntechnical  staff  of  other  local  authorities.  Output  2  will  be  cosponsored  through  the  in-kind \ncontributions  of  local  authorities  (provinces,  cities  or  municipalities)  and  will  include  the \npreparation of a set of consolidated training materials. The technical courses will cover the \nfollowing subjects: (i) urban planning and land management, (ii) contract management and \nprocurement, (iii) social and environmental safeguards, and (iv) operation and maintenance of \nurban infrastructure.  \n \n11.  Output 3: Finalization of the urban development strategy document. The TA will \nassist the executing agency in finalizing the draft strategy document. This document will include \na draft urban development code that will assess the gender sensitivity of urban development \ncode.  The  TA  consultants  will  participate  in  government  consultation  meetings  to  receive \nfeedback and guidance on the draft document.  \n \n ", "4              \n \n12.  Output  4:  Institutionalization  of  the  urban  management  capacity  development \nprogram. Under the TA, the executing agency and the selected national institution (Training \nCentre for Land Management under the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and \nConstruction) will undergo a training of trainers program. Subsequently, the executing agency \nwill propose funding sources to ensure the sustainability of the program and its future activities.  \n \n13.  The  consolidation  of  the  capacity  development  program  will  need  to  go  beyond \ninformation  exchange  for  managers  and  training  of  technical  staff  by  (i)  assessing  which \nmanagement systems need to be introduced or enhanced; (ii) providing opportunities for more \nequitable  decision-making  processes;  and  (iii)  broadening  participation  in  organizational \nmanagement. This could include financial management software, e-procurement, geographic \ninformation systems, land valuation systems, human resources development, and management \nof the existing urban information system (known as \u201cdistrict data books\u201d). Further capacity \ndevelopment requirements may be related to the establishment of a subnational investment \nfacility under the Decentralization and Deconcentration Three-Year Implementation Plan, 2011\u2013\n2013. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000 equivalent. The Government of Cambodia has \nrequested ADB to finance $700,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and communication facilities \nfor consultants (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  Ministry  of  Land  Management,  Urban  Planning  and  Construction  will  be  the \nexecuting agency. The Training Centre for Land Management  will be the implementing agency. \nThe Economic and Finance Institute under the Ministry of the Economy and Finance may be \ninvolved in conducting training courses that involve its area of specialization.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, from 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2014. \nThe  TA  will  finance  an  estimated  7  person-months  for  an  international  consultant  and \n106 person-months for national consultants. The international and national consultants will be \nengaged through firm(s), according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). The quality- and cost-based selection method, using the quality\u2013\ncost ratio of 80:20 and full technical procedures will be followed. Disbursements under the TA \nwill be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time).  \n \n17.  The team of consultants will operate under the guidance of a team leader, assisted by \nthe international advisor (urban development and management expert). The core team will \ncomprise a civil engineer, procurement specialist, social safeguards specialist, environment \nspecialist, and urban planner. The urban planner will be the deputy team leader. The terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The TA will be aligned with the government\u2019s agenda for (i) environment and climate \nchange, and (ii) decentralization and deconcentration. Expected outputs and outcomes will be \ndisseminated  through  government  channels,  according  to  the  Law  on  Administrative \nManagement of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts, and Khans (footnote 3).  \n       ", "5 \nIV.

Output  1:  Implementation  of  a  pilot  urban  management  capacity  development \nprogram. The pilot program will consist of a training needs assessment that will lead to the \ninitial design of pilot capacity development measures (training, systems development, human \nresources development). Development of curricula, training materials, and a training mechanism \nwill result in a pilot program, which will be tested in (i) management workshops\u2014intended for \nmanagers and unit heads at provincial and local levels, and (ii) short courses\u2014intended for \ntechnical staff. Management workshops will focus on \u201chow to manage\u201d subjects, while technical \nshort courses will deal with \u201chow to do it\u201d issues. The capacity development approach prioritizes \nmanagement of processes and maximization of existing skills and experiences, rather than \nduplicating the skills training programs of institutions of higher technical learning (universities \nand  technical  colleges).  Substance-wise,  these  activities  are  intended  to  focus  on  project \npreparation and implementation, e.g., subproject feasibility studies, procurement, environmental \nsafeguards  (including  climate  change  adaptation),  social  safeguards,  operation  and \nmaintenance, and project evaluation and monitoring. Preparatory work should include (i) a \nreview of the key challenges, constraints, and opportunities for women, and (ii) a medium- to \nlong-term capacity development and human resources development plan to bring women into \ndecision-making  positions  in  the  urban  management  sector  in  provincial  and  municipal \ngovernments. \n \n3.  Output 2: Scaling-up of the urban management capacity development program. \nOnce  the  pilot  activities  have  been  completed,  measures  for  scaling  up  the  capacity \ndevelopment program will be prepared. These will involve all municipalities to be covered by the \nGreater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns Development Project and the Integrated Urban \nEnvironmental  Management  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin  Project  (both  proposed  for  ADB  loan \napproval in 2012\u20132013). Experienced urban managers from bigger cities and provinces will \nshare their experiences and practical approaches with managers and technical staff of other \nlocal  authorities.  The  scaling-up  of  the  program  will  be  cosponsored  through  in-kind \ncontributions of the local authorities (provinces, cities or municipalities). Output 2 will include the \npreparation of a set of consolidated training materials. The technical courses will cover the \nfollowing subjects: (i) urban planning and land management, (ii) contract management and \nprocurement, (iii) social and environmental safeguards, and (iv) operation and maintenance of \nurban infrastructure. \n \n4.  Output 3: Finalization of the urban development strategy document. The technical \nassistance (TA) will assist the executing agency in finalizing the draft strategy document, which \nwill  include  an  urban  development  code.  The  consultants  will  participate  in  government \nconsultation meetings to receive feedback and guidance on the draft document.  \n \n5.  Output  4:  Institutionalization  of  the  urban  management  capacity  development \nprogram. Under the TA, the executing agency and the selected national institution (Training \nCentre for Land Management under the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and \n ", "Appendix 3            11 \n \n \nConstruction) will undergo a training of trainers program. Subsequently, the executing agency \nwill propose funding sources to ensure the sustainability of the program and its future activities. \n \n6.  Consolidation of the capacity development program will need to go beyond information \nexchange  for  managers  and  training  of  technical  staff,  and  will  need  to  assess  which \nmanagement  systems  need  to  be  introduced  or  enhanced.  This  could  include  financial \nmanagement  software,  e-procurement,  geographical  information  systems,  land  valuation \nsystems, human resources development measures, and management of the existing urban \ninformation system (known as \u201cdistrict data books\u201d). Further capacity development requirements \nmay  be  related  to  the  establishment  of  a  sub-national  investment  facility,  expected  to  be \nestablished under the decentralization and deconcentration 3-year implementation plan 2011\u2013\n2013. \n \n7.
