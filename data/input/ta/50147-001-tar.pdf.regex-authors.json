INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Enhancing Competition \nin Public Service Delivery. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016\u2013\n2018  for  the  PRC.1 In  June  2016,  ADB  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  reached  an \nunderstanding on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of \nreference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, 2016\u2013\n2020  provides  the  market  a  more  prominent  role  in  public  service  delivery.  This  includes \ncompeting to provide public services, and identifying and applying innovative approaches.  The \ngovernment will refrain from offering a service directly if it can purchase the service. The ways \nof providing public services  will be diversified through increased participation of the social \ncapital sector, which includes the private sector and state-owned enterprises. Competition to \ndeliver  public  services  will  be  enhanced  by  promoting  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs), \nimproving the quality of the government\u2019s procurement of services, and reforming public entities \nthat provide social services. These commitments will be complemented by proposed reforms in \ngovernment administration and management systems, including how the government intervenes \nin and supervises the market.3 \n \n3.  Public services can only be delivered on an effective competitive basis if there are fair \nand  impartial  market  rules  that  secure  the  confidence  of  market  participants.  Sound  and \ntransparent government procurement systems are essential for effective competition in public \nservice delivery. Development partners such as ADB recognize that government procurement is \ninterwoven  with  key  development  issues,  including  private  sector  development,  economic \ngrowth, and poverty reduction. Good procurement practices reduce costs and produce timely \nresults; poor practices lead to waste and delays. Weaknesses in a government\u2019s procurement \nsystem adversely affect welfare and prospects for growth.4 \n \n4.  In the PRC, government procurement is guided by the Law on Tendering and Bidding, \nwhich covers the construction of public works projects, and the Government Procurement Law \n(GPL), which is used for expenditure funded through the general government budget.5 The \nNational Development and Reform Commission is responsible for the Law on Tendering and \nBidding. MOF, through its Treasury Department, administers the GPL; issues regulations to \nguide the implementation of the law; supervises day-to-day procurement through its provincial, \nmunicipal,  and  county  bureaus;  and  provides  frequent  training  programs  to  enhance  the \ncapacity of local governments in public procurement.6 \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 August 2016. \n3  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2016. The 13th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social \nDevelopment of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132020. Beijing (chapters 34 and 61). \n4  ADB.  2015.  The  Governance  Brief:  Understanding  Public  Procurement.  http://www.adb.org/sites/default/ \nfiles/publication/28646/governancebrief03.pdf \n5  The Law on Tendering and Bidding became effective in January 2000. The Government Procurement Law became \neffective  in  January  2003  and  was  amended  in  2014.  The  Regulation  on  Implementing  the  Government \nProcurement Law became effective on 1 March 2015. \n6  The regulations include (i) Provisions for the Management of Experts Appraising Government Procurement (2003), \n(ii) Management Provisions for Publication of Information on Government Procurement (2004), (iii) Tendering and \nBidding Management Provisions for Government Procurement of Goods and Services (2004), (iv) Provisions for \n ", "2   \n5.  ADB assessments of the PRC\u2019s procurement systems are broadly positive. The laws \nand regulations governing public sector procurement are based on international good practices \nand principles. The PRC\u2019s procurement systems require the use of competitive bidding as the \nmain procurement method and contain provisions that deal with corrupt practices. Procurement \nhas  become  more  standardized  and  transparent  since  the  enforcement  of  the  GPL,  and \nprotection  against  malpractice  and  collusion  has  improved.  Nevertheless,  there  are \nopportunities to strengthen procurement systems and practices.7 \n \n6.  The value of government procurement reached CNY1.7 trillion in 2014 to account for \n11.4% of public expenditure. This was equivalent to 2.7% of gross domestic product (GDP).  \nPractices in other countries suggest there is significant potential for expansion in government \nprocurement. It typically accounts for 10%\u201315% of GDP in developed countries and as much as \n20%  of  GDP  in  developing  countries.  In  2013,  in  GDP  terms,  government  procurement \nexpenditures as measured in national accounts amounted to an average of almost 14% of GDP \nin the European Union and to more than 10% of GDP in the United States.8 The developed \ncountries have progressed further in employing the purchaser\u2013provider model, transforming the \ngovernment away from being the dominant supplier of public services, and relying more on the \nmarket. \n \n7.  The PRC still lacks a national government procurement assessment system that can \nmeasure  procurement  efficiency  centrally  and  locally,  identify  systematic  issues  affecting \nperformance, and provide guidance on potential enhancements. It also needs tools that can \nexamine  actual  procurement  practices  and  provide  the  information  required  to  establish  a \nprogram  of  continuous  improvement.  The  general  public  raised  some  concerns  on  public \nprocurement  efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  media  reports  that  suggest  the  government \nprocurement  system\u2019s  operational  procedures  and  fiduciary  oversight  could  be  improved. \nFurthermore,  the  GPL  needs  to  be  aligned  with  international  good  practices.  During  the \nnegotiations that led to the accession of the country to the World Trade Organization, the PRC \nagreed the GPL would comply with the basic spirit of the World Trade Organization Agreement \non Government Procurement.  \n \n8.  Providing information to buyers, sellers, and other market participants is also essential \nfor effective competition in public service delivery. Lack of information causes inefficiency that \nunnecessarily adds to the cost of transactions or prevents them altogether, and deters private \ninvestors from taking risks. Information shortages can also erode confidence among the broader \ncommunity about the quality of local governments, which carry most of the responsibility for \nservice delivery in the PRC. Opening access to information about how governments work would \nhelp open public services to competition. \n \n9.  The government has actively promoted PPPs since late 2013. MOF established the \nChina Public Private Partnership Center (CPPPC) in July 2014 to cover PPP policy advisory, \nconsultations, capacity development, project financing, information disclosure, and international \ncooperation.9 Local governments have copied the central government\u2019s initiatives, including \nthrough the compilation of demonstrative projects and the establishment of PPP centers.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nResolution  of  Disputes  (2004),  and  (v)  Implementing  Provisions  for  Central  Institutions\u2019  Governmental \nProcurement. \n7  ADB. 2015.

High-quality information disclosure on PPPs to the public would help the reforms of the \n13th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020 for the delivery \nof public services. The use of PPPs to deliver public services is rising rapidly across a broad \nrange of sectors. CPPPC reported 9,285 PPPs as under development or implementation as of \nJune 2016, most of which are with local governments.10 The total investment value of about \n$1.6 billion for these PPPs is comparable to the annual general budget expenditure by local \ngovernments  of  about  $2.5  billion  and  annual  local  government  infrastructure  spending  of \nalmost $700.0 billion.11 \n \n11.  Ensuring transparency in PPP projects and processes will enhance competition within \nthe PPP program, thereby improving the value for money offered. Transparency can also help \ngenerate an understanding of and confidence in the government\u2019s performance. Many countries \nrelease information about their PPP programs through widely accessible information platforms \nguided by disclosure policies. In December 2015, MOF issued the Notice on Regulating the \nPPP  Comprehensive  Information  Platform  Operation. 12  The  document  highlighted  the \nimportance of PPP disclosure and designated CPPPC to establish an information platform. In \nFebruary 2016, the comprehensive PPP information platform released the national digital library \non the PPP investment pipeline (footnote 10).13 Information on PPP pipelines at different levels \nof government, the status of projects, PPP-related regulations, and operating guidelines are \nnow collected and disseminated on the platform. Information about qualified PPP consulting \nfirms and individual specialists is also posted on the platform. However, more detailed PPP \ndisclosure guidelines are still needed. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.      The impact will be the promotion of competition in public service delivery, and is aligned \nwith the PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, 2016\u2013\n2020. The outcome will be enhanced market-based rules and transparency in public service \ndelivery.  The  performance  will  be  assessed  through  a  government  procurement  system \nassessment  tool  (GPAT)  by  2019,  and  submission  to  the  government  of  PPP  disclosure \nguidelines within 3 months after completion of the TA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will produce four outputs under two components. Outputs 1 and 2 will form \ncomponent A, and outputs 3 and 4 will form component B. Component A will assist MOF\u2019s \nTreasury Department in enhancing the present procurement system. Component B will help \nCPPPC to further develop the PPP information disclosure system.    \n \n                                                \n10 CPPPC.

Building \non past reviews by the PRC, ADB, and other development partners, output 1 will conduct an \nassessment on the strengths and weaknesses of the government procurement system and the \nroles of key government agencies involved in procurement. Output 1 also will conduct research \non the legal framework governing procurement centrally and locally, and on the procurement \npractices adopted by different government agencies. It will also identify any weaknesses and \nopportunities for further improvements, as well as opportunities to align with best international \npractices. The TA will develop the GPAT in line with international good practices, notably the \nMethodology  for  Assessing  Procurement  Systems  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-\noperation  and  Development.  The  GPAT  will  provide  a  user-friendly  tool  for  ongoing \nassessments of the quality and effectiveness of government procurement. The TA will pilot the \nuse of the GPAT in selected implementing agencies, which MOF and ADB will jointly identify. \n \n15.  Output 2: Policy recommendations for improvements of the existing procurement \nsystem drafted. Based on the assessment of the present procurement system and the pilot use \nof the GPAT, the consultant team will prepare recommendations for further refinement of the \nGPAT and government procurement. \n \n16.  Output  3:  Policy  recommendations  on  public\u2013private  partnership  disclosure \ndrafted. The TA will review the information disclosure frameworks and practices for PPPs in \nother jurisdictions. Output 3 will identify the key drivers of disclosure. It will prepare an overview \nof the general transparency environment, the history and outlook for PPP disclosure, political \neconomy considerations, the legal and policy framework, the disclosure process, the relevant \ninstitutions and their roles, and how confidential information is treated. Output 3 will address key \nissues in PPP contract information disclosure, including confidentiality requirements, templates, \ntechnology, and bid terms and conditions. It will also analyze the disclosure approaches for \ndifferent stages of the PPP project life cycle.  \n \n17.  Based on international practices and the PRC\u2019s experience and special circumstances, \nthe TA will propose a policy package for CPPPC on the further enhancement of PPP program \ntransparency.14 The emphasis will be on the disclosure of project information. The TA will \nconduct at least three workshops. Local PPP practitioners, international financial institutions, \nand international PPP units will participate in the workshops, sharing experience and views on \nPPP disclosure. \n \n18.  Output 4: Public\u2013private partnership disclosure guidelines drafted. The TA will \ndraft guidelines for CPPPC\u2019s consideration, drawing on output 3. The guidelines will also build \non  relevant  public  information  disclosure  regulations  and  be  consistent  with  CPPPC\u2019s \nmandates.  They  will  identify  the  required  information  disclosure  at  each  stage  of  project \npreparation and implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $660,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).

MOF\u2019s Department of International Economic and Financial  Cooperation will be the \nexecuting agency. MOF\u2019s Treasury Department will be the implementing agency for component \nA, while CPPPC will be the implementing agency for component B. The consultants will be \ntasked to each relevant component. The implementing agencies will be responsible for the day-\nto-day implementation of the TA, including managing the workshops, surveys, and conferences.  \n \n21.  The proposed TA will be implemented over a 24-month period from 1 October 2016 to \n30 September 2018. Under component A, the TA will require 12 person-months of individual \nconsulting services, including one international consultant (procurement specialist) for 4 person-\nmonths  and  two  national  consultants  (one  procurement  specialist  and  one  public  finance \nmanagement specialist) for 8 person-months. Under component B, the proposed TA will engage \none international consultant (1 person-month) and three national consultants (9 person-months).  \n \n22.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  individually  because  the  timeliness  of  recruitment  is \nimportant. TA implementation will make extensive use of participatory workshops, which will \nrequire a wide range of skills and experience; therefore, a substantial provision will be allocated \nfor resource person recruitment as needed. Lump-sum payments will be considered during TA \nimplementation. The consultants and resource persons will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline \nterms of reference is in Appendix 3. Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline and budget allocation. To support \nmonitoring and evaluation, the consultant teams will submit an inception report, a midterm \nreport, a draft final report, and a final report to the government and ADB. All reports will be \nsubmitted in English and Chinese to the executing agency and ADB in hard and electronic \ncopies. The TA review missions will be the main mechanism to monitor progress, assess \nperformance, and ensure relevance of the TA.  \n \n24.  Risks include (i) policy recommendations are not accepted by policy makers, (ii) the \nsupport for reforms to improve the procurement system cannot be secured, and (iii) government \nagencies provided insufficient data and inputs. \n \nIV.
