Negotiations for the \nrenewal of the Compact of Free Association (Compact) between the Palau and United States \n(US) governments is expected to begin in the second half of this year. A review process is \nunderway, which included the establishment of the Compact Review Commission (CRC) in \nFebruary 2006.  \n \n2.  During the 2006 Country Programming Mission, the Government requested technical \nassistance  (TA)  to  provide  a  fast-response  facility  to  assist  economic  policy  formulation, \nfacilitate the budget process, strengthen private sector development, and foster infrastructure \nmanagement. In response, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) included support for such a \nfacility  in  the  2007  TA  pipeline.  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Department  conducted  the  TA  Fact-Finding \nMission on 16\u201324 November 2006. A memorandum of understanding outlining the proposed TA \nwas signed on 24 November 2006. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \n3.  ADB  has  commissioned  a  country  environment  assessment  and  a  private  sector \nassessment. It also supported Palau to host an economic symposium which will result in a \nsocial  sector  analysis  and  a  Pacific  Islands Economic  Report  (PIER).  These  activities  will \ncontribute to  Palau\u2019s national planning processes. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The current Compact between the US and Palau is due to expire in September 2009. \nThere are widespread concerns within Palau about the total financial package that may be part \nof a new Compact. A significant reduction in US funding for the Government\u2019s recurrent and \ncapital  expenditures  may  be  part  of  the  new  Compact,  which  will  require  large  fiscal \nadjustments. \n \n5.  The Government has a series of medium-term development plans, including strategic \nroad maps and policy guidelines for economic development. These plans include the National \nMaster Development Plan2 (NMDP) and the Study for Promotion of Economic Development in \nthe Republic of Palau.3 The Government\u2019s Public Sector Investment Program also provides \nguidelines  and  priorities  for  infrastructure  investment  activities.  A  management  action  plan \nprovides  specific  planning  and  management  guidelines  for  the  executive  branch.  Some \nprogress is being made in preparing the economy for potential fiscal adjustment in line with \nthese development plans, but at a slower rate than anticipated. \n \n6.  On 7\u20139 February 2006, the President of Palau convened a leadership symposium to \ngather  inputs  from  national  and  local  government  entities  for  a  consolidated  development \nstrategy, which would represent a national consensus on Palau\u2019s future. There was widespread \nengagement with stakeholders in the Government, local government, the judiciary, and the \ncommunity. The CRC was established after the symposium and will review the progress of the \n15  years  under  the  Compact  by  conducting  economic  analysis,  social  auditing,  an \nenvironmental assessment, and a governance review. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 1 March 2007. \n2  Government of Palau. 1996.

A Master Development Plan \n7.  The current NMDP, prepared in 1995, has not been an effective tool for directing Palau\u2019s \ndevelopment  activity.  It  was  prepared  without  widespread  community  and  government \nconsultation and does not have the necessary ownership to enable it to be used effectively.. \nThe planned  update will be managed by the Government, not a consultancy group. The TA will \nsupport the update of the NMDP by providing consultants and resources focused on widespread \ncommunity consultation, as well as technical expertise in selected areas. \n   \n8.  An  updated  plan  will  consolidate  the  Government\u2019s  vision  for  the  future,  focus \ndevelopment and investment, and facilitate preparations for Compact negotiations with the \nGovernment of the United States. The current NMDP is 12 years old and, while not strictly time-\nbound, was intended to lead into Compact negotiations in 2009. The Compact negotiations will \nform the basis of the next 15 years of development planning, and therefore an updated NMDP is \nnow needed. \n \n2.  State of the Economy \n9.  The Palau economy is dominated by the public sector. The Government employs 31% of \nthe workforce. Public expenditure is 55%\u201360% of gross domestic product (GDP). The remainder \nof the economy consists mainly of tourism, retail, subsistence agriculture, and fisheries. The \neconomy relies on imports and the ratio of imports to GDP ranges from 75% to 115%. Despite \nlarge  service  account  surpluses  generated  by  tourism,  the  trade  account  has  dominated, \nresulting in current account deficits in recent years. \n \n10.  Palau\u2019s economy has sizable fiscal deficits, including wide swings in the gap between \nexpenditure  and  revenue  ranging  from  3%  to  28%  of  GDP.  In  preparing  for  Compact \nnegotiations the country\u2019s fiscal position is weak but noticeable improvement have been made \nsince the implementation of the compact in 1994. \n \n11.  Tax collections in Palau are about 20% of GDP. The Government\u2019s expenditure gap is \nfinanced through borrowings, Compact payments, and returns from the Compact Trust Account. \nTax collections include (i) a narrowly based income tax (about 5% of GDP), (ii) import duties \n(about 6% of GDP), and (iii) a gross receipts tax (about 6% of GDP). According to a report  by \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF),4 the efficiency of tax collection is low and efforts to \nimprove collection are being implemented.  \n \n12.  The Government is pursuing cost savings to address funding shortfalls. Its target is to \ncut annual recurrent expenditure by $10 million to a fiscally sustainable $50 million\u2013$55 million. \nThere is some doubt whether such a reduction in recurrent expenditure is achievable, given (i) \ndifficulties in controlling the wage and salary bill, (ii) the rising maintenance bill from a decade of \ninfrastructure development, and (iii) operations and maintenance costs for the new capital of \nPalau.  \n \n13.  It  will  also  be  difficult  to  pursue  savings  in  the  capital  expenditure  budget.  The \ninfrastructure network remains incomplete, and further investment is needed to reach desired \ngrowth dividends. Careful planning will be needed in preparation for Compact negotiations. \n                                                 \n4  IMF. 2005. The Article IV Consultation Paper. Washington, DC. \n ", "  3\n3.  Government Infrastructure and Services \n14.  Government-owned  businesses  supply  water,  sewage,  electricity,  gas,  and \ncommunications services. Some of these have management boards. The government owns the \nport, but operations are privatized.  \n \n15.  There is no effective regulation of the price and service standards for any of the utilities, \nports, or the airport. Limited competition has recently been brought into the telecommunications \nsector, resulting in price reductions. There is insufficient competition in other sectors to enable \nmarket-driven pricing or service standards.  \n \n16.  The public sector deficit limits Government investment in infrastructure in the utility \nsector. The TA will consider the potential for alternative utility operation including public\u2013private \npartnerships and private ownership. \n \n17.  Palau  has  a  large  stock  of  infrastructure  provided  through  various  grant  and  loan \nprojects, especially in in recent years. Urgent maintenance is required as the defects liability \nperiods on new infrastructure come to a close.  \n \n18.  Palau  needs  to  review  its  the  current  infrastructure  and  consider  what  further \ninfrastructure is required to achieve NMDP goals. As Government revenue is, and will remain, \nconstrained,  the  infrastructure  policy  review,  analysis,  consultations,  and  recommendations \nproposed for the TA will support the preparation of a revised NMDP.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The TA will assist the Government to achieve economic sustainability through improved \neconomic  and  infrastructure  management  by  the  Government.  The  TA  comprises  two \ncomponents. Component 1 will facilitate economic policy formulation and implementation for \nsustainable budget management. Component 2 will develop an infrastructure development plan \nfor  affordable  infrastructure  development  and  ongoing  infrastructure  operations  and \nmanagement. The cost of operation and maintenance of existing public infrastructure and the \nfunding of new infrastructure will be key constraints on sustainable budget management and \ndevelopment planning. Component 2 focuses on providing the information necessary to support \ncomponent 1, while also providing an infrastructure blueprint for further policy development in \npublic utilities management. \n \n20.  For component 1: sustainable economic policy formulation, the key outcomes of the TA \nwill include (i) improved policy formulation and budget management for sustainable growth, and \n(ii) sustained increases in Government revenues.  \n \n21.  The key outputs of component 1 will be (i) an updated NMDP; (ii) enhanced economic \npolicy  formulation  in  order  to  achieve  the  NMDP  objectives;  (iii)  sector-specific  policy \nrecommendations  in  agriculture,  aquaculture,  fisheries,  the  labor  market,  human  resource \ndevelopment, education, and health in order to deliver the NMDP objectives; and (iv) policy \nrecommendations on ways to increase Government revenue so it can meet ongoing financial \ndemands and fund NMDP proposals.  \n \n ", "4   \n22.  For component 2, the infrastructure development plan, the key outcome of the TA will be \nthe adoption of the plan. The plan will include (i) an assessment of existing infrastructure stock \nand  future  infrastructure  needs,  (ii)  policies  on  financing  of  infrastructure  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs,  and  (iii)  policies  on  mainstream  environmental  protection  in  the \ninfrastructure sector. \n \n23.  The key outputs of component 2 will be (i) an infrastructure needs assessment for the \nNMDP objectives, (ii) an infrastructure maintenance program for existing and potential stock, (iii) \na costed infrastructure maintenance plan, (iv) alternative provider  models for infrastructure \nmaintenance, and (v) alternative provider models for the delivery of existing utilities. \n \n24.  Outputs from components 1 and 2 will be used to update the NMDP. The Government is \ncommitted to writing and owning the NMDP. The TA will facilitate this in an appropriate way, \nincluding but not limited to: logistical support, funding participatory workshops with community \ngroups, editorial services, and compilation and dissemination of draft plans.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n25.  The TA will build on existing work under the ongoing regional TA Strengthening Pro-\nPoor Policy in the Pacific 5 which is compiling a PIER for Palau and undertaking a review of \nsocial  sectors  as  background  for  the  NMDP.  ADB  has  recently  also  completed  a  country \nenvironment assessment and a private sector assessment.6 The Pacific Financial Technical \nAssistance Centre (PFTAC) is providing assistance for tax reform and Government revenue \nestimation. It is essential that the TA, working through the Government, coordinates its inputs \nwith the work of the PFTAC, other ADB initiatives, and those of other donors. \n \n26.  Ownership by the Government and people of Palau of the outputs of the TA will be \nrealized by ensuring all work is coordinated by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the CRC. All \nwork plans for the TA and for individual consultants will be approved by the Government. \nHowever, flexibility will be needed so the TA and individual consultants are able to respond to \nemerging issues and information gaps as the preparation of the NMDP proceeds. \n \n27.  Key activities of the TA include: \n(i)  Component 1: \n(a)  Develop macroeconomic and fiscal policies and indicators for sustainable \ndevelopment. \n(b)  Prepare a paper on cost-effective options to meet future demand in social \nservices such as health, education, and social services. \n(c)  Develop  an  action  plan  for  the  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  aquaculture \nsectors. \n(d)  Prepare  a  paper  on  policy  recommendations  for  an  economically \nsustainable NMDP. \n(e)  Implement  an  action  plan  to  strengthen  sustainable  economic  policy \nformulation. \n(f)  Identify opportunities to broaden the Government tax base. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

Cost and Financing \n28.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $1.4 million. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance the equivalent of $1 million. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The TA funds will be \ndisbursed based on ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grants (1992, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  Government  has  agreed  to  provide  the  balance  of \n$400,000 equivalent in kind through counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative \nsupport services, provision of transport, and local logistics. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n29.  The MOF will be the Executing Agency. A TA focal point will be appointed by the \nMinistry to supervise the TA activities and liaise with the consultant team. The CRC will be the \nImplementing Agency for component 1,7 and the Ministry of Resources and Development the \nImplementing Agency for component 2. The TA focal point, CRC, and the Ministry of Resources \nand Development will work with the team leader to ensure the timely delivery of TA outputs. The \nteam  leader  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating,  directing,  and  monitoring  the  quality  and \ntimeliness of the outputs and the quality and timeliness of activities of the team members and \nfor procuring equipment and training materials. The team leader will ensure that equipment \nnecessary for training, workshops, and seminars will be available for use by consultants during \nthe TA. An equipment list will be prepared by the TA focal point and consultants for ADB \napproval. The equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time) and turned over to MOF on completion of the TA.8 \n \n30.  The consultancy firm will be responsible for the timeliness and quality of the TA and \nassociated reporting. All written material (reports, plans, recommendations and analysis) by the \nconsultant should be written for the Government. \n \n31.  The TA is expected to be carried out over a period of 22 months, starting in August 2007 \nwith fielding consultants, and finishing before June 2009. ADB will engage a team of consultants \n(20  person-months  international  and  20  person-months  national)  with  expertise  in \nmacroeconomics;  economic  management  and  planning;  the  social  sector;  agriculture, \n                                                 \n7  If CRC is terminated or transformed into another commission for negotiation in 2007, the Executing Agency and \nADB will identify and nominate a new Implementing Agency.  \n8  All equipment and training materials utilized throughout the TA will become the property of the Government of \nPalau at the end of the TA. \n ", "6   \naquaculture,  and  fisheries;  private\u2013public  partnerships;  infrastructure;  and  the  environment. \nDuring  implementation,  more  individual  consultants  may  be  engaged  for  specific  technical \nservices to support the TA as needed.9 A team of consultants will be engaged as a firm by ADB \nby quality-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Quality-based selection is justified because of the complexity of \nthe TA for country economic and sectoral work and the flexibility needed to include individual \nspecialist consultants, as required. Appendix 3 contains the outline terms of reference. Short-\nlisted firms will submit simplified technical proposals. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n32.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Palau for the Facility for Economic and Infrastructure Management, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n9  Such specialist areas may include, but are not limited to, sectoral specialist (health, education, human resource, \netc.), workshop facilitators, and specialized infrastructure technical specialists and may be international or national. \nThe specialists will be engaged individually. \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms    \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nGovernment of Palau  Budget forecasts show  National accounts  \u2022  Government is \nachieves economic  a balanced budget by    committed to policy and \nsustainability.  2015  institutional reform \n\u2022  Government sustains \nmacroeconomic \ndevelopment \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nImproved economic      \u2022  Government\u2019s \nand infrastructure  \u2022  Budget is approved  \u2022  Budget paper  commitment to cost \nmanagement by the  on time  \u2022  ADB review missions  reduction \nGovernment  \u2022  Increase in tax  \u2022  Economic outlook  \u2022  Private sector engages \n  revenue by 5%  \u2022  National accounts  partnership with public \n  \u2022  Infrastructure    sector \ndevelopment plan    \u2022  Sufficient human \nrecommendations  resources are engaged \nreflected in a fiscal  by the Government to \nbalanced budget by  effect change \nFY2010  \u2022  Parliament committed to \n  taxation reform \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \nComponent I       \n1.
