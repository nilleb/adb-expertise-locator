During the 2004 Country Programming Mission, the Government of India confirmed its \nrequest for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare the \nKarnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Project (KUIDP) III. Following further discussions, \nthe Government and ADB agreed that TA1 would be provided in 2004 and the proposed loan in \n2005 subject to approval by ADB's Board of Directors. A Fact-Finding Mission was conducted in \nBangalore,  India,  from  15  to  19  November  2004  to  prepare  the  TA.  The  mission  held \ndiscussions with officials of Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Company \n(KUIDFC),  Urban  Development  Department,  Directorate  of  Municipal  Administration,  Town \nPlanning  Department,  and  Karnataka  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  to  reach \nunderstanding on  the objectives, scope, costs, and implementation arrangements of the TA. \nThe preliminary project framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Various institutions in the state are responsible for the  management and delivery of \nbasic urban services. At the local level, urban local bodies provide and manage services. \nKarnataka has a total of 222 urban local bodies, namely, 6 city corporations, 41 city municipal \ncouncils, 82 town municipal councils, and 93  gram panchayats. The Department of Urban \nDevelopment  oversees  city  corporations  and  the  Directorate  of  Municipal  Administration \noversees municipalities.  \n \n3.  The 2002 report of the High-Power Committee for Redressal of Regional Imbalances of \nthe Government of Karnataka (GoK) highlighted the need for urban infrastructure investments in \ntowns in north Karnataka. Economic indicators, such as per capita income, poverty levels, and \nextent of infrastructure development, demonstrated that these towns lagged behind those in \nsouth Karnataka. The lack of urban infrastructure services has become a growth inhibitor and a \nsignificant contributor to poverty and the economic imbalance between towns in north and south \nKarnataka.  \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s assistance began in 1995 and focused on the south. KUIDP I2 provided total \nassistance of $105 million for formulating an integrated urban development strategy for the \nBangalore subregion. KUIDP I provided an opportunity to develop \u201ccounter magnet\u201d urban \nlocations  or  growth  centers.  A  component  of  the  loan  was  directed  toward  improving \ninfrastructure in the four towns of Channapatna, Mysore, Ramanagaram, and Tumkur, and later \nthe towns of Maddur and Mandya were added, to reduce congestion in Bangalore. A $20 million \ncomponent of the loan was channeled through the Housing Development Finance Corporation \nfor on-lending to qualified individuals at affordable interest rates for the purpose of promoting \nhousing ownership and reducing the housing shortage in Bangalore and the four subject towns. \nThis latter assistance was evaluated as successful,3 because it led to the formulation of further \nADB assistance for full-scale housing loans.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 September 2004. \n2  ADB. 1995.

KUIDP II,4 approved in October 1999, provided assistance of $145 million to GoK to \nsupport urban infrastructure development in coastal Karnataka and to facilitate policy reforms to \nstrengthen urban management. Ten towns were included in this Project.5 The objectives of this \nProject included (i) strengthening the capacity of local governments in relation to resource \ngeneration and cost recovery to achieve sustainability in the operation and maintenance (O&M) \nof the investments; and (ii) establishing appropriate environmental planning, management, and \nmonitoring mechanisms to address the potential environmental impacts associated with urban \nand industrial growth in the region. The Project experienced implementation delays, but the \npace of contract awards has picked up in recent months. The Project is currently rated as \nsatisfactory by the project performance management system.  \n \n6.  The executing agency for both projects was KUIDFC, which is wholly owned by GoK and \nwas incorporated in 1993. KUIDFC has the following functions: (i) formulating and appraising \nurban infrastructure projects, (ii) providing financial assistance and TA to municipalities and \ndevelopment agencies, (iii) mobilizing funds from different sources, (iv) carrying out project \nmonitoring and implementation, (v) formulating and implementing capacity-building programs for \nthe effective delivery of urban services, and (vi) assisting with municipal sector reforms. \n \n7.  Following its experience with implementing KUIDP I and KUIDP II and other externally-\nfunded and domestic projects, KUIDFC has now evolved into an agency capable of managing \nexternally aided projects for GoK. KUIDFC has engaged consultants to help prepare KUIDP III. \nKUIDP III is designed to address deficient urban infrastructure and provide sustainable basic \nurban services in approximately 21 selected towns in north Karnataka  that have traditionally \nlagged in development because of deficiencies in the provision of basic urban infrastructure \nservices. The Project will help the selected municipalities in the following areas: (i) water supply \nand sewerage, (ii) urban drainage, (iii) solid waste management, (iv) roads, and (v) slum \nimprovement. Three key areas for urban development will be considered in the design of the \nProject, namely: (i) equity in the coverage of services, (ii) environmental acceptability and (iii) \noperational sustainability. \n \n8.  As the types of investments contemplated have sometimes been plagued by poor O&M \npractices, low user charges and poor technical and commercial efficiencies, KUIDFC would like \nto address these issues and develop its capability in employing performance-based deferred \npayment schemes for the procurement, operation, management, and maintenance of some of \nthe components of the Project. These are schemes whereby payments are made to contractors \nbased on predetermined performance standards. KUIDFC has engaged consultants to develop \nsuch schemes for KUIDP III.  \n \n9.  KUIDFC, along with GoK, has initiated project preparation and has engaged consultants \nfor this purpose. A draft report is expected to be available for review by ADB by end of \nDecember 2004.  \n  \n10.  Within  the  given  framework,  the  TA  will  augment  the  project  preparation  activities \nundertaken by GoK and help meet ADB\u2019s due diligence and policy requirements. The ensuing \nProject is expected to boost economic growth in the selected towns through the provision of \nsustainable urban infrastructure services. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1999.

Manila (Loan 1705-IND, for $145 million, \napproved on 26 October 1999). \n5  The towns are the primary urban centers of Dandeli, Karwar, Mangalore, Sirsi, and  Udupi, as well as Ankola,      \nBhatkal, Kandapura, Puttur, and Ullal. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The objective of the TA is to (i) review the feasibility study prepared by GoK and (ii) \ncomplement and augment the study to prepare a project suitable for ADB financing. A sector \nloan approach will be adopted for the Project. The TA will focus primarily on (i) reviewing the \nperformance-based deferred payment schemes proposed by GoK and their application to the \nproposed Project; (ii) examining the tariff frameworks to ensure the sustainability of the O&M of \nthe investments; (iii) performing financial management assessment of the Project\u2019s executing \nand  implementing  agencies;  and  (iv)  helping  to  prepare  safeguard  frameworks  for  the \nenvironment, resettlement, and indigenous peoples and related plans, as applicable. Based on \nGoK's feasibility study, the TA will prepare one main report and three town reports for the \nsample subprojects. A summary initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The outputs of the TA will include (i) an investment project suitable for financing by ADB \nand in accordance with ADB\u2019s policies, (ii) a strategy for implementing tariff and cost recovery in \nthe proposed investments, (iii) an economic and financial analysis, and (iv) the environmental \nand social impact frameworks.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  As  GoK  has  initiated  project  preparation  activities,  the  consultants  will  review  the \nassessments, analyses, and reports prepared by GoK and its consultants upon commencement \nof their respective assignments. The consultants will also review GoK and ADB policies and \nguidelines as they apply to their particular areas. Meetings with GoK will be arranged during the \nfirst 2 weeks of the consultants\u2019 assignment to obtain an overview of GoK\u2019s thrust and approach \nin relation to project preparation. Following these meetings, the consultant team leader will \nprepare an inception report identifying the approach and activities for the duration of the \nassignment. The team leader will produce a consolidated report, including three town reports, \nthat contains all the information necessary to prepare a project for ADB financing. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $510,000 equivalent, comprising foreign currency \ncost of $338,000 and local currency of $172,000 equivalent. The entire foreign currency cost of \n$338,000 and $62,000 equivalent in local currency will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTA  funding  program.  GoK  will  provide  $110,000  equivalent  for  fully  equipped  office \naccommodation,  counterpart  staff  support,  local  transportation,  and  other  administrative \nexpenses. GoK will also provide all information required for the TA activities. The Government \nand GoK have been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. Appendix 3 presents the cost estimates and financing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  KUIDFC will be the executing agency for the TA and will be  responsible for overall \ncoordination with ADB. KUIDFC will also be the implementing agency. KUIDFC will provide \ncomplete administrative and technical support to the consultants and will coordinate all activities \nunder the TA with other government agencies. KUIDFC will provide adequate office space for \nthe consultants with sufficient equipment and means of communication. KUIDFC\u2019s managing \ndirector will be the TA coordinator.  \n ", "4  \n16.  An  Empowered  Committee  has  been  established  for  the  previous  ADB  projects \nconsisting of senior GoK officials. A similar arrangement is proposed for KUIDP III, with the \nEmpowered Committee chaired by GoK\u2019s additional chief secretary for externally aided projects. \nMembers of the committee will include the secretaries of all concerned state departments, such \nas  Planning,  Finance,  Public  Works,  Urban  Development,  and  Urban  Water  Supply  and \nDrainage Board, as well as the managing director of KUIDFC and the director of the Directorate \nof Municipal Administration. In the interim, as  key milestones are reached, reports will be \nfurnished to KUIDFC and GoK\u2019s Urban Development Department for review and approval. The \nfinal report will be submitted to the Empowered Committee. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 5 months from mid-February 2005 to mid-July 2005. \nADB will engage all consultants on an individual basis, in accordance with it's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The consulting services for the TA total \n14 person-months (10 international and 4 domestic). An inception report, which will propose the \nmethodology for carrying out activities, is expected to be submitted to ADB by the team leader \nwithin 2 weeks of TA commencement. Progress reports will be submitted as agreed in the \ninception report. A draft final report will be submitted 2 weeks prior to the conclusion of the \nassignment.  The  final  report  will  incorporate  comments  from  ADB  and  GoK  and  will be \nsubmitted at the end of the assignment. The experts to be engaged will include an urban \ndevelopment  and  municipal  engineer  acting  as  the  team  leader  (5  person-months),  an \nenvironmental specialist (1 person-month), a social development specialist (1 person-month), \nan economist (1 person-month), two financial analysts (3 person-months), a public-private \nfinance specialist (2 person-months), and a water and sewerage tariff specialist (1 person-\nmonth).

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Karnataka: \n \nInvestments in urban infrastructure have positive spinoffs in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction. The \nproposed Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Project III (KUIDP III) is expected to boost the regional \neconomy through the provision of improved urban services. The 2002 report of the High-Power Committee for \nRedressal of Regional Imbalances of the Government of Karnataka also provides an economic argument in favor of \ninvestments in urban infrastructure in towns in north Karnataka, a region that has traditionally lagged behind the rest of \nthe state. The committee suggests that improved urban infrastructure in the region will lead to increased private \ninvestment, and therefore to the reduction of regional imbalances in the state. The Project is expected to reduce \npoverty through better access to basic services. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s poverty reduction strategy also \nemphasizes access to basic services.  \n \nAn assessment of the current situation in the project towns has identified the poor quality of urban environmental \ninfrastructure and a gap in basic service provision, particularly to the poor. KUIDP III will address deficiencies in basic \nneeds on a citywide basis. Direct benefits will be sustained improvements in water supply, sanitation, and solid waste \nmanagement within all the project towns. Indirect benefits will be improved living conditions and improved health status \nof the population.  \n \nA baseline socioeconomic survey was conducted in the slums in each of the project towns. The baseline reveals the \nstatus of the urban poor in terms of basic service access and will serve as the benchmark against which post project \nbenefits to the poor may be measured. Overall, respondents revealed extremely poor access to sanitation, with an \naverage of about 85% of respondent slum households in the pilot towns stating that they had a complete lack of \naccess to sanitation. Direct benefits from the sanitation component are expected to accrue to households that will be \nable to connect to the sewerage network. Provision of the network will be in the densely built-up core and unserved \nand underserved areas in the peripheries. To ensure access by the poor to safe sanitation, separate provisions are \nmade for slum settlements. Proposed sewerage networks will cover the entire town and will reach the boundaries of \nslum areas, which will enable the networking of a large number of slums and the provision of toilets connected to \nsewers (individual or community, depending on space availability). The Project is expected to benefit all slum \nhouseholds residing in recognized slums (i.e., more than 90% of slum households in each town). The solid waste \ncomponent in each town is expected to benefit the town\u2019s population as a whole, including the poor. \n \nBenefits to poor households from the road component will be from employment generation for local poor laborers by \ngiving priority for unskilled jobs to local laborers. Direct and indirect benefits will also accrue to a town\u2019s entire \npopulation, including the poor, through improved access.  \n \nAn average of almost 80% of slum households in all the towns reported high dependence on standposts for their water \nsupply. Access to house service connections is reported to be much lower. Added to this are issues related to water \npressure and duration and frequency of supply. The benefits of improved water supply are expected to accrue to the \nentire population, including the poor. Slum households (estimated to account for 20% of the total urban population in \nthe  towns)  will  benefit  directly  from  the  Project  through  additional  investments  identified  for  improved  tertiary \ndistribution within slum settlements. All nonslum poor households (estimated at about 15% of the total urban \npopulation) will benefit directly from proposed improvements to the town\u2019s water supply. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA poverty impact analysis will be undertaken during the project preparation technical assistance. \n \nParticipatory analysis using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques is required to gauge post project \nbenefits in terms of improved access to basic services by the poor. The baseline survey will serve as the benchmark \nagainst which post project impacts on the poor may be measured. Benefits to poor households; benefits to women; \nand capacity building of the poor, including women, are some of the issues that must be monitored or measured \nfollowing implementation. \n ", "  Appendix 2  7 \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n  \nStakeholder consultations have been an important element of project development and design. Ten consultation \nworkshops have been held with district and municipal officials, elected representatives, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) and citizens. An additional seven consultations with district- and municipal-level officials were also held. \nHousehold surveys of general and slum populations in each town (through which people\u2019s opinions were sought and \ntheir needs assessed) and focus group discussions with the community are important elements of the study. These \nconsultations and structured interactions with the community will help identify and prioritize projects under KUIDP III \nfor each town. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                 No \n \nPublic participation has been a key feature of project design so far and will continue through detailed design and, \nwherever possible, during planning, implementation, and operation and maintenance.  The proposed strategy for \npublic participation focuses on partnership building between NGOs, business communities, urban local bodies (ULBs), \nstakeholder agencies like the Karnataka Slum Clearance Board, and neighborhoods. An assessment of the absorptive \ncapacity of the community was undertaken prior to preparing the participation strategy. The involvement of local, town-\nlevel, or district-level NGOs and of an apex NGO to monitor community participation in the project is envisaged. The \napex NGO will be responsible for transferring know-how to local NGOs and training trainers from local NGOs, who in \nturn will train community managers.  \n \nThe structures and functions of community-based organizations and neighborhood groups are proposed, each having \nwomen members, a community infrastructure volunteer responsible for articulating the basic infrastructure needs of \nthe neighborhood groups and a community savings volunteer responsible for savings and credit activities. At the city \nlevel, a community development society has already been instituted in most of the cities. Each society\u2019s members \ninclude ward-level, resident community volunteers; a project officer appointed by the ULB; a member from each local \nNGO; and an ex-officio member from the Social Welfare Department. Training representatives from the ULB in \nparticipatory planning and implementation and gender issues is also proposed. The progress of activities will be \ndiscussed at monthly meetings. Participation by the community development societies in the formulation of city-level \naction plans and the monitoring of the Project is proposed, which will help with concurrent evaluation of the Project and \nmidcourse corrections.  \n \nOngoing consultation and participatory monitoring will help ensure that project elements meet communities\u2019 needs, \nthereby contributing to their sustainability. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe strategy for participation as outlined focuses on women\u2019s participation, which is expected to maximize the \nbeneficial impacts on women. The impact of proposals such as the increased role of women in project design, \nimplementation, and monitoring; the reduced burden of water collection; the health benefits accruing to families; the \nemployment opportunities, etc. resulting from the Project may be measured after implementation. Monitoring and \nevaluation systems will generate gender-disaggregated information to enable the tracking of gender implications and \nthe impact of the Project.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?
