THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) for the second additional financing of the Public \nFinancial Management Project.1 \n \n2.  Since 2017, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the Government of \nthe Marshall Islands through a project grant to strengthen public financial management (PFM). \nAs with the project\u2019s first additional financing in 2019, the proposed second additional financing \nwill scale up the scope of the ongoing project and extend its benefits by supporting the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) in prioritizing and implementing further PFM reforms.2 To allow for the additional \nactivities,  the  conclusion  of  the  project\u2019s  implementation  period  will  be  extended  from  31 \nDecember 2021 to 30 June 2024. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development challenges compounded by the pandemic. The RMI is a small island \ndeveloping state in the North Pacific. As one of the lowest-lying atoll nations globally, climate \nchange risks are particularly heightened. The RMI receives grants averaging 18.4% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) through its Compact of Free Association with the United States.3 Strict \ntravel  restrictions  and  quarantine  requirements since  the  onset  of the coronavirus  disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic have helped detect all four positive COVID-19 cases at the border but \nhave also damaged economic activity. The prolonged border closure contributed to successive \neconomic contractions. Following a decline of 5.5% in fiscal year (FY) 2020, the economy is \nprojected to contract by a further 1.4% in FY2021, while exports and transshipment related to \nfisheries, and construction activity remain subdued.4 Domestic purse seine fishing and tuna \nloining operations declined by about 30% in FY2020 and are expected to remain below pre\u2013\nCOVID-19 levels in FY2021.5 A recovery to 2.5% growth is anticipated in FY2022 when progress \nin COVID-19 vaccinations is expected to enable a resumption of business activity and a possible \nreopening of borders.6 \n \n4.  Continued need for public financial management reforms. The RMI's 2012 public \nexpenditure and financial accountability assessment (the latest available) pointed to significant \nweaknesses in the PFM framework.7 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlighted the \npriority areas for improving PFM, such as the legal and policy framework, budgeting framework, \n \n1  ADB.

A requirement for ships to spend at least \n14 days at sea prior to entry is limiting transshipment activity in Majuro, the world\u2019s busiest tuna transshipment port. \n6  The Vaccine Tracking System of the United States Centers for Disease Control indicates that, as of 6 July 2021, the \nRMI had received a total of 51,300 doses, and about 35.3% of the adult population is fully vaccinated. \n7  Government of the Marshall Islands. 2012. Public Financial Management Performance Report and Performance \nIndicators (Final Report). Majuro. \n ", "2 \naccounting system, fiscal reporting, and cash management.8 Since FY2012, the RMI\u2019s profile of \ndomestic resource mobilization has shifted toward nontax revenues, which comprised about 57% \nof own-revenue collections during FY2016\u2013FY2018, up significantly from only about 20% prior to \nFY2012.9 The RMI\u2019s PFM Reform Roadmap 2014\u20132016 includes a component on strengthening \nthe management of nontax revenue.10 A 2017 progress report on the road map also prioritized \nstronger  management  of  nontax  revenues  to  ensure  that  additional  resources  are  utilized \nefficiently, including by avoiding parallel increases in recurrent spending during windfall revenue \nperiods.11 Moreover, although the government has made substantial progress in developing the \nNational  Planning  Framework  and  laying  the foundations for  performance-based  budgeting \nnationally, cascading these initiatives to local government units will help improve the efficiency of \nsubnational public spending and service delivery as well. \n \n5.  Fiscal risks from state-owned enterprises and contingent liabilities. Although the \nRMI\u2019s public debt stock fell steadily from 85.2% of GDP in FY2000 to 31.5% in FY2019, about a \nthird of the outstanding debt is borrowing by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with government \nguarantees.12 SOEs depend on government support\u2014subsidies to the RMI\u2019s 11 active SOEs \ntotaled $15.5 million (7.3% of GDP) in FY2017, before easing slightly to $13.7 million (6.2% of \nGDP) in FY2018. Contingent liabilities also arise from the Marshall Islands Social Security \nAdministration. The gap between benefit payments and contributions amounts to about $3 million \nannually, and pressures will only increase in the longer term (footnote 8). The latest available \nestimates also show that unfunded liabilities are more severe for the Marshall Islands Social \nSecurity Administration than for other social security funds in the North Pacific.13 \n \n6.  Acute capacity constraints. Structural challenges stemming from the RMI\u2019s geographic \nconstraints, exposure to external shocks, and heavy reliance on development assistance translate \ninto thin capacities for effective governance. Given a high turnover among senior staff\u2014partly \nbecause of open opportunities for labor mobility to the United States as part of the Compact\u2014\nand  with  junior  staff  often  underqualified  or  lacking  experience  to  perform  their  functions \nadequately, MOF continues to require long-term institutional capacity development to implement \nthe PFM and SOE reforms effectively. The ministry lacks a specialized nontax revenue unit for \ntracking and forecasting collections, particularly of fishing license fees (para. 4). The resulting lack \nof  a  medium-term  perspective  and  policy  for  expenditure  smoothing  contributed  to  large \nunplanned increases in public spending backed by revenue rises prior to COVID-19. Also, weak \nframeworks and capacities to monitor and control contingent liabilities translated into mounting \nfiscal risks (para. 5). Capacity constraints are even more pronounced in local governments, where \nlimited budgetary and human resources hamper efficient service delivery. Several development \npartners\u2014including ADB, the World Bank, the IMF's Pacific Financial Technical Assistance \nCentre, and the United States\u2014are assisting in designing and implementing PFM reforms. MOF \nrequires long-term on-the-ground support to coordinate this assistance. \n \n8  IMF. 2018.

IMF Country Report No. 18/270. \nWashington, DC. \n9  Since the full implementation in 2012 of a regional vessel day scheme, the RMI's collection of fishing license fees \nincreased to an average of $20.6 million (10.0% of GDP) during FY2012\u2013FY2019, from $1.6 million (1.1% of GDP) \non average during FY2004\u2013FY2011.

North Pacific Economies in Asian Development Outlook 2020. Manila. \n ", "3 \n7.  Ongoing project. On 13 October 2017, ADB approved the original project for $2.0 million \n(footnote 1). The original project supports strengthening MOF's institutional capacity to help it \nimplement the PFM and SOE reforms effectively. On 17 September 2019, ADB approved an \nadditional financing of $0.5 million to scale up and consolidate activities under the original project \nand allow for further PFM and SOE reforms to be implemented. The ongoing project\u2019s current \nclosing date of 31 December 2021 will be extended to 31 December 2024 with the proposed \nsecond additional financing. \n \n8.  A reform coordination unit (RCU) was established under the original project as a pool of \nlong-term consultants based in Majuro to provide on-the-ground support to MOF.14 The RCU is \nadequately staffed and fully functional, providing day-to-day advice, assistance, and capacity \nbuilding to government counterparts. Under the ongoing project, the RCU updated the PFM \nReform Roadmap (footnote 10) and contributed to 12 of the 30 broad reform areas in the updated \nversion.15 Among the key recent achievements of the RCU is the development of a draft fiscal \nresponsibility  and  debt  management  bill  to  help  underpin  longer-term  fiscal  sustainability, \nidentification of necessary institutional, systems, and capacity upgrades to facilitate tax reform, \nand continuous updates of the RMI\u2019s medium-term budgeting and investment framework. \n \n9.  Human  resources  development  is  a  crosscutting  enabler  of  reform  implementation. \nThe RCU reviewed MOF's positions and related job descriptions to inform the preparation of \norganizational reforms. It also helped strengthen performance management by (i) introducing \nstandardized  performance  criteria  and  performance  evaluation  tools  for  MOF  employees, \n(ii) building the capacity of MOF's human resources staff to conduct results-oriented performance \nreviews  that  link  staff  performance  to  organizational  performance,  and  (iii)  introducing  a \nperformance-based management framework. To support longer-term and sustainable capacity \ndevelopment, the RCU is partnering with the College of the Marshall Islands to design and deliver \na tailored training course on government accounting for young Marshallese graduates. \n \n10.  Progress was made in SOE reforms as well. The establishment in 2018 of an SOE \nmonitoring unit in MOF, which was further bolstered by the creation in 2019 of an assistant \nsecretary position to oversee the unit, helped MOF complete draft agreements on community \nservice obligations (CSOs) with four SOEs.16 To rationalize inefficient annual subsidies, the \ncabinet authorized the switch to formal performance-based CSO contracts for two of these SOEs. \nThe RCU is helping empower qualified women to serve on SOE boards. As of June 2021, women \noccupied only 27.5% of directorships on SOE boards, although this is an improvement on the \n21.5% in 2018. In response to government requests for tailored capacity building to allow women \nto better compete in skills-based director selection, the RCU is now providing specialized training \non SOE governance skills for women. \n \n11.  Second additional financing. The project meets the eligibility criteria for additional \nfinancing. In ADB\u2019s assessment, the ongoing project is rated performing well, based on: \n \n14 The core group of RCU consultants, including the team leader, remained in Majuro throughout the COVID-19 \npandemic. Short-term consultants on tax reforms and fiscal responsibility legislation provided support remotely. \n15 Includes progress in (i) the overall PFM legal and policy framework, (ii) budgeting framework, (iii) annual reporting \nby line ministries, (iv) cash management, (v) procurement management, (vi) payroll management, (vii) asset \nmanagement, (viii) introduction of a performance-based management framework, (ix) management of imprest \naccounts of all of the embassies of the Marshall Islands, (x) external audit, (xi) aid coordination, and (xii) PFM reform \ncommunications and training. More details on the activities and progress under the ongoing project are in Summary \nof Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 CSO agreements cover specific units of goods and services to be supplied legitimately by SOEs under defined terms \nand conditions and at stipulated prices. These terms, along with a detailed cost-of-services study, then determine \nthe amount of annual financial support that will be required by SOEs to deliver their respective CSOs. \n ", "4 \n(i)  Satisfactory  implementation  progress.  Cumulative  contract  awards  total \n$2.475 million  (99.0%  of  ADB  financing)  and  cumulative  disbursements  total \n$2.215 million (88.6% of ADB financing) as of 21 June 2021. This is against time \nlapsed from project start to scheduled completion of 85.0%. \n(ii)  Delivery of expected outputs on track. Project implementation is on track to \ndeliver  all  expected  outputs.  Under  output  1:  MOF\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to \nimplement the PFM Reform Roadmap 2014\u20132016 of the RMI strengthened, the \nRCU updated the road map and contributed to advancing at least 12 (against a \ntarget of 6 in the original project\u2019s design and monitoring framework) of the \n30 broad reform areas in the updated road map (para. 8). The RCU also conducted \n30 capacity building sessions during 2018\u20132020, where women made up 52% of \nthe participants. Under output 2: MOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement SOE \nreforms strengthened, an SOE monitoring unit was set up, and the CSOs of four \nSOEs were defined and costed (para. 10), as stipulated in the original project\u2019s \ndesign and monitoring framework. \n(iii)  Satisfactory compliance with fiduciary and safeguard policy requirements. \nThe project is classified as category C for environment, indigenous peoples, and \ninvoluntary  resettlement  because  it  provides  only  advisory  services. \nEach safeguard  covenant  item  of  the  ongoing  project  is  complied  with.  The \nongoing project also complies with the prevailing financial management covenant. \n(iv)  Successful management of risks. The risk mitigation measures of the ongoing \nproject are being implemented satisfactorily. These include the delegation of \nconsultant selection to ADB, subject to the government\u2019s final decision on their \nengagement. The government actively encourages suitable candidates to apply \nfor sustained availability of support. Regular development partner coordination \nmeetings ensure the timely provision of complementary technical assistance (TA). \n(v)  Project performance rating on track. Overall, the ongoing project is rated on \ntrack  under  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  rating  system.  The  audited  financial \nstatements, covering FY2019\u2013FY2020, were received on 9 April 2021. \n \n12.  Another additional financing is a suitable modality because the proposed activities remain \nstrongly linked to the design of the ongoing project, while contributing to the same outputs and \noutcomes relating to improved PFM. As demonstrated by the first additional financing, this \nmodality adequately supports the goal of scaling up the project\u2019s scope by expanding the reform \nareas. The implementation arrangements also remain unchanged, while additional individual \nconsultants are expected to be recruited as part of the RCU, under the supervision of MOF. \nThe overall project\u2019s intended impact is aligned with the good governance pillar of the RMI's \nNational Strategic Plan 2020\u20132030.17 The second additional financing is also consistent with \nADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2021\u20132025, which serves as the overall country partnership strategy for \nthe 11 small Pacific developing member countries, including the RMI; it specifically prioritizes \nPFM improvements as a means to prepare for and respond to shocks, and to build resilience.18 It \nalso aligns with Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priority 6\u2014strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity, particularly in small island developing states\u2014by building capacities to implement PFM \nand SOE reforms; and with operational priority 2\u2014accelerating progress in gender equality.19 \n \n17 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2020.

The overall project\u2019s intended impact will remain the same: more effective governance \nachieved in the RMI. 20 The target outcome continues to be improved PFM, to be achieved by \nsustaining efforts to strengthen MOF\u2019s institutional capacity for (i) prioritizing and implementing \nthe PFM Reform Roadmap, and (ii) designing and implementing SOE reforms.21 \n \n14.  Output 1: MOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement the PFM Reform Roadmap \nstrengthened. To support the achievement of the first output and advance the intended outcome \nof further PFM improvements, the RCU will focus on three additional reform components in the \nPFM Reform Roadmap under the second additional financing: \n(i)  Improving the management of nontax revenue. The project will support the \nestablishment of a nontax revenue unit at MOF responsible for (a) formulating \npolicies and operating guidelines for nontax revenues; (b) developing databases \nand other information systems to strengthen collection forecasts as inputs to the \nannual budget process; and (c) conducting a comprehensive review of fees and \ncharges to enable the formulation of a phased price adjustment and rebasing plan. \n(ii)  Strengthening control over contingent liabilities. With RCU support, the SOE \nmonitoring unit will prepare a policy paper on strengthening the management of \ncontingent liabilities arising from SOE operations. The unit will help review and \nrefine the applicable policies, e.g., those on loan guarantees to local governments \nand SOEs, and on the issuance of indemnities through the social security scheme. \nThe revisions will serve as a critical input to the development of draft legislation \naimed at containing the fiscal risks from the accumulation of contingent liabilities \nby local governments and SOEs, and from unfunded social security liabilities. \n(iii)  Introducing performance-based budgeting for local governments. The project \nwill expand its support to include capacity building for local governments and their \nadoption of performance-based budgeting to align operational budgets with the \nNational Strategic Plan and applicable sector plans (para. 4). This is a natural \nextension of the ongoing work toward national performance-based budgeting, \nwhich included setting key performance indicators for line ministries linked to the \nNational Strategic Plan. Similar key performance indicators will be developed \nsubnationally to support the PFM Reform Roadmap\u2019s aim of improving local \ngovernments\u2019 financial management. The project will introduce gender-sensitive \nframeworks for performance-based budgeting across local government units to \nensure that community-based service delivery meets women\u2019s needs adequately. \n \n15.  The second additional financing will also support further progress in areas already covered \nby the ongoing project. Building on initial work on tax reform (para. 8) supporting the PFM Reform \nRoadmap\u2019s component on improving tax administration, the focus will be on capacity building for \nthe tax office and finalization of the government\u2019s tax reform agenda. The additional financing will \nsupport the design of legislation to (i) replace import taxes, gross revenue taxes, and local sales \ntaxes with a consumption tax, business net profits tax, excise taxes, and revised tax rates for \nwages and salaries; and (ii) implement new business processes and a new digital revenue \nmanagement system to help administer the new tax system. A key component of this second \nadditional financing is to support extensive consultation with all stakeholders, as well as close \ncoordination with development partners to facilitate the implementation of the new tax policies. \n \n20 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2014.

Output 2: MOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement SOE reforms strengthened. \nThe second additional financing will enable the project to sustain the reform momentum by \n(i) completing draft CSO agreements with five more SOEs; and (ii) progressing to formal CSO \ncontracts with at least two more SOEs. A comprehensive assessment of CSO costs will help \nidentify, and eventually phase out, the portion of subsidies that effectively finance lingering SOE \ninefficiencies, which will help reduce the annual transfers. Streamlined subsidies will contribute to \nthe intended outcome of improved PFM through more efficient public spending. The RCU will \ncontinue to provide specialized training to empower women to serve on SOE boards, designed \nand implemented in coordination with gender champions in the Office of the Chief Secretary and \nthe Ministry of Culture and Internal Affairs (Gender Development Division) (para. 10). \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n17.  Past engagement. The project builds on previous ADB support to the RMI for progressing \nPFM and SOE reforms. Through two subprograms of the Public Sector Program in 2010\u20132012, \nADB assisted the RMI in adopting and implementing reform plans to improve the performance of \nselected SOEs, completing a public sector workforce audit and planning exercise, and achieving \nspecific expenditure targets.22 ADB also provided TA to support the implementation of the \ngovernment\u2019s national development plan.23 In addition, regional TA helped the RMI improve \ngovernance within SOEs and define SOE policy and legislation, develop a fiscal management \nmodel, and periodically clear audit backlogs.24 \n \n18.  Lessons. ADB's previous engagement (footnote 22) highlighted the need to remove acute \ncapacity constraints through long-term on-the-ground support, as is being provided by the RCU. \nExperience from the ongoing project further confirms the crucial importance of long-term capacity \nbuilding and supplementation, not only to underpin reform progress but also to support MOF in \nthe performance of its day-to-day core functions. The support for MOF is translating into broader \nbenefits for other ongoing ADB operations for which MOF is the executing agency. Delegating \nthe recruitment of consultants to ADB, while subject to the government's final decision on their \nselection and engagement, also helped ease constraints in procurement capacity and expedited \nthe mobilization of key experts. ADB is working closely with development partners, such as \ncoordinating efforts with the World Bank\u2019s parallel project to upgrade the RMI's outdated financial \nmanagement information and procurement systems, and holding periodic discussions with the \nIMF\u2019s Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre. The technical capacity being built by the \nproject can serve as a solid foundation for ADB's and other development partners' long-term \nengagement in public sector management in the RMI. \n \n19.  Differentiated approach. The project continues a differentiated approach to supporting \npublic sector reforms in small island developing states that are constrained by thin capacities for \neffective governance, such as the RMI. This involves (i) using long-term capacity building and \nsupplementation support primarily through consultants based in Majuro to facilitate the design, \nprioritization and implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and refinement of reforms; (ii) broad-\nbased engagement while building capacity for deeper reforms; and (iii) integration with related \n \n22 ADB. 2014.

Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n20.  The overall project is estimated to cost $5.15 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).25 \nThe major expenditure item is consulting services to resource the RCU and SOE monitoring unit. \n \n21.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $2.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The summary financing \nplan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to consulting services, and training \nand capacity building activities. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \nstaff time,  office  space  and supplies,  and  exemptions  from taxes  and  duties  estimated  at \n$300,000. No cofinancing is envisaged. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \nCurrent Amounta  Additional Financingb  Total \nItem  ($)  ($)  ($) \nA.  Base Costc       \n  1.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 25). \n \n23.  The arrangements established for the ongoing project will be used to implement the \nsecond additional financing. MOF will continue to be the executing agency, and the RCU remains \n \n25 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nthe implementing agency. The PFM Reform Steering Committee will provide strategic oversight \nand guidance. The consultant recruitment process will still be delegated to ADB, but consultants \nwill be engaged by, and report to, MOF. \n \n24.  The second additional financing is expected to allow for the renewal of the contracts of \ncurrent RCU consultants to sustain the project\u2019s support for the implementation of the PFM \nReform Roadmap as well as the three additional priority components (para. 14). All current RCU \nconsultants are performing satisfactorily, providing quality services that meet MOF\u2019s expectations \nand needs. Since additionally required inputs are a natural continuation of the RCU\u2019s ongoing \nwork, contract extensions provide a clear advantage over renewed competition. The contracts of \nthe RCU advisor and team members will be extended to maintain uninterrupted technical and \ncoordination support across all reform areas. In addition, the RCU\u2019s long-term resources will be \naugmented by contracting two additional financial management specialists to continue and further \nstrengthen the unit\u2019s support for government accounting and auditing. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  August 2021\u2013June 2024 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2024 \nEstimated grant closing date  31 December 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Public Financial Management Reform Steering Committee \nChief secretary (chair) \nSecretary of finance, auditor general, attorney general, chair of the Public \nService Commission (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Reform Coordination Unit \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Reform Coordination Unit, 9 long-term staff: (i) 1 advisor, (ii) 1 public finance \nspecialist, (iii) 3 financial management specialists, (iv) 1 human resources \nspecialist, (v) 2 accounting specialists, and (vi) 1 administrative assistant \nConsulting services  Individual consultant selection  205 person-months  $1,846,000 \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting for consultants \nDisbursement  The  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB's Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and the Asian Development Bank. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n25.  The RCU advisor and financial management specialists will support MOF\u2019s development \nof policies, systems, and institutional arrangements for the establishment of a nontax revenue unit \nin MOF (para. 14.i). They, along with the human resources expert\u2014who oversees broader \nknowledge  management  and  capacity  building  activities,  while  also  focusing  on  change \nmanagement initiatives\u2014will develop and implement training on performance-based budgeting \nfor local governments (para. 14.iii). The proposed SOE reform implementation activities will be \nundertaken by the current SOE reform expert, whose contract will be extended. Supported by the \nRCU  advisor  and  the  human  resources  specialist,  and  in  close  consultation  with  gender \nchampions in the government, the SOE reform expert will develop training courses to upskill \nwomen and thus enable them to better compete for positions on SOE boards. The SOE reform \nexpert will also review and refine policies to bolster the government\u2019s control of contingent \nliabilities and help prepare the requisite legislation (para. 14.ii). Under the second additional \nfinancing, the RCU is targeted to have 9 long-term experts under contract, i.e., the current 7 RCU \nconsultants whose contracts will be renewed, and 2 additional financial management specialists \n(para. 24) to be recruited. In selecting the consultants, preference will be given to qualified women. \n \n ", "9 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n26.  Since the project involves the provision of advisory and capacity building services rather \nthan  any  revenue-generating  investment,  standard  cost\u2013benefit  and  cash  flow  analyses  to \ndetermine its economic and financial viability are not applicable. Instead, a simplified quantitative \napproach focusing on the second additional financing\u2019s support for nontax revenue management \nis employed. Financial benefits arise from the additional fiscal space that the government can \ngenerate by controlling inefficient increases in recurrent spending, to be underpinned by improved \nmanagement of nontax revenues. In turn, economic benefits derive from the productive use of \nthis additional fiscal space through development-oriented public spending such as capital outlays \nor investments in education and health. Under conservative assumptions whereby the RMI\u2019s \nrecurrent spending on the purchase of goods and services gradually declines by the equivalent \nof 15.9% of GDP in FY2021 to 15.0% by FY2024, the second additional financing is shown to \nyield additional fiscal space of about $4.0 million, plus multiplier effects from productive public \nspending of at least $2.0 million, indicating solid value for money.26 \n \nB.  Sustainability \n \n27.  Capacity building measures supported by the RCU, mainly by prioritizing knowledge and \nskills transfer when the unit works with staff from MOF and other relevant line agencies, will help \nensure the sustainability of reform benefits. Necessary follow-on capacity building activities can \nbe identified and supported by ADB in coordination with other development partners engaged in \nPFM reforms in the RMI. National consultants working with the RCU are also gaining skills that \nwill help position them for potential absorption in the workforce of the national government. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  Financial management. An assessment prepared for MOF prior to the approval of the \noriginal project indicated that the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial. \nWith support from the RCU established through the project, qualified staff are working closely with \nMOF to implement the PFM reforms and to manage the identified risks. An April 2021 update of \nthe financial management assessment confirms that, although the overall inherent and control \nrisks remain substantial, mitigation measures put in place through the ongoing project are proving \nto be successful in helping manage these risks. Under the second additional financing, ADB will \ncontinue to employ the direct payment procedures for international consultants established under \nthe ongoing project. An advance account will be set up for the second additional financing\u2014to be \nadministered by MOF with RCU assistance, with a ceiling of $100,000\u2014for small payments (e.g., \ntraining  materials,  workshops,  and  project  operational  expenses).  MOF  will  facilitate  the \npreparation of detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited by an independent \nauditor acceptable to ADB, and in accordance with both the International Standards on Auditing \nand the government\u2019s audit regulations. The final audit report for the ongoing project covering \nFY2019\u2013FY2020 was received on 9 April 2021. \n \n29.  Procurement. Similarly, a procurement capacity assessment of MOF undertaken prior to \nthe approval of the original project found substantial overall pre-mitigation procurement risk. \nThe issues that could affect project procurement include (i) weak external aid coordination, \n(ii) MOF\u2019s  inadequate  prior  experience  with  the  international  procurement  of  consultants, \n \n26 Economic and Financial Analyses (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n(iii) absence of reliable data on procurement contracts, (iv) insufficient capacity of staff to carry \nout procurement, and (v) inadequate procurement documentation and monitoring. Support from \nthe RCU is likewise helping to mitigate procurement risks. Only individual consultants will be \nprocured under the project\u2014their recruitment under the second additional financing will again be \ndelegated to ADB because this has worked very well for the ongoing project\u2014and contracts will \nnot be complex or high-value. All procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and MOF. ADB will conduct integrity due diligence on consultants, \nand anticorruption efforts will continue to be discussed in the training sessions provided by the \nRCU,  as  appropriate.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  Poverty and social. ADB's 2015 assessment of socioeconomic vulnerability in the RMI \nestimated the basic-needs poverty incidence at 38.4% of the population (36.6% at the household \nlevel). Income poverty is greater in the outer islands than in the urban centers of Majuro and \nEbeye. In 2020, ADB estimated that the poverty rate would have fallen to 29.4%\u201331.6% by \nFY2019, but the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are now projected to \nraise the poverty rate to 33.8%\u201335.2% by the end of FY2021. The project is designed to contribute \nto poverty reduction through improved PFM systems and stronger SOE management, which will \nreduce fiscal deficits, help build fiscal buffers to manage external shocks, and create a foundation \nfor sustainable and inclusive economic growth. \n \n31.  Gender. As with the original project and the first additional financing, the second additional \nfinancing is classified as some gender elements. Women will not only benefit from program design \nelements that contribute to poverty reduction, but also from proactive gender actions. The plan to \nupgrade MOF\u2019s human resources proposes the prioritization of qualified women in recruitment \nand  promotions.  The  introduction  of  gender-sensitive  frameworks  for  performance-based \nbudgeting across local government units will help improve the community-based delivery of \nservices  that  meet  women\u2019s  needs.  The  overall  project  will  continue  to  promote  women\u2019s \nempowerment  through  (i)  targets  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  project  training  activities; \n(ii) specialized training to equip women for directorships on SOE boards; and (iii) proactive \nmeasures to increase the proportion of women in MOF's management positions, subject to \nqualifications. Also, the biannual progress reports prepared by the RCU will continue to include \nsex-disaggregated data and reporting on gender actions. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.27 \n \n33.  Environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples (all category C). No \nadverse environmental, involuntary settlement, or indigenous people impacts were identified, \nsince the project involves only advisory and capacity building inputs. \n \n \n27 ADB.
