The policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) will support improved water planning, \nmanagement, and development in Indonesia.1 The government requested the TA in a dialogue \nbetween  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  the  Ministry  of  Public \nWorks, and Asian Development Bank (ADB). Concept clearance for the TA was approved on 8 \nApril 2013. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Development agenda. The well-being of the Indonesian people depends heavily on \nwater. As Indonesia grows, enjoying annual economic expansion that averaged 5.7% in 2005\u2013\n2010 and accelerated to 6.5% in 2011, water challenges intensify and jeopardize sustained \ndevelopment. To guide its economic development, Indonesia prepared the Acceleration and \nExpansion of Indonesia Economic Development, 2011\u20132025 (MP3EI) that is based on three \npillars\u2014(i)  developing  the  economic  potential  of  six  regional  corridors;2 (ii)  strengthening \nnational connectivity locally and internationally; and (iii) strengthening human resource capacity, \nscience, and technology. The MP3EI recognizes food security and improved water and energy \npolicies as prerequisites for its implementation. In 2014, Indonesia will update its National \nMedium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN),  2015\u20132019,  which  guides  planning  within  and \nacross sectors. Together, the RPJMN and the MP3EI provide the economic and development \nplanning  framework  for  Indonesia,  within  which  the  government  wants  to  prioritize  water \nconcerns to sustain economic growth. \n \n3.  The  government\u2019s  development  agenda  requires  assistance  to  analyze  the  water \nconcerns and priorities of the MP3EI. This assistance should include support for country water \nassessment  (CWA)  that  will  help  provide  the  analytical  foundation  for  water  planning, \nmanagement, and development, including investment to further economic development. The \nMP3EI can guide the priorities to be addressed under the CWA, and detailed water sector plans \ncan support the economic development agendas of the regional corridors under the MP3EI. The \nCWA  can  advance  water  reform  across  Indonesia  while  providing  guidance  for  planning, \nmanagement, policy, and investment in the MP3EI economic corridors. Analysis for the CWA \nand its associated regional plans can support RPJMN development and ensure synergy with the \nMP3EI. The CWA will also provide guidance to help address the many challenges facing \neffective water resources management (WRM) and reliable water service delivery in Indonesia.3 \n \n4.  Water  supply  and  sanitation  challenges.  Indonesia\u2019s  economic  growth  spurs \nurbanization, with the percentage of Indonesians living in urban areas expected to increase from \n53% in 2010 to 65% by 2025. Government decentralization has tasked local governments with \nmanaging  water  supply  agencies  (PDAMs),  70%  of  which  are  heavily  indebted  and  have \nextremely high nonrevenue water losses, some exceeding 50%. Rates of access to water \nsupply and sanitation (WSS) have been declining, with piped water supply reaching only about \n31% of urban residents and 12% of rural residents. PDAMs supply water to only 18% of all \nIndonesians.  Sewage  treatment  coverage  is  very  low,  serving  less  than  1%  of  the  urban \npopulation. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 July 2013. A fact-finding \nmission  from  20  February  to  9  April  2013  (intermittent)  confirmed  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. \n2  The corridors include Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali\u2013Nusa Tenggara, and Papua\u2013Kepulauan Maluku. \n3  The challenges are highlighted in ADB sector assessments, strategies, and road maps for the sectors (i) water \nsupply and sanitation and (ii) agriculture, environment, and natural resources. \n ", "2  \n5.  Water resources challenges. Significant WRM challenges exist. Sediment caused by \nwatershed degradation damages water infrastructure and raises water treatment costs. On Java \nalone from 2003 to 2009, flooding annually took an average of 140 lives, 20,000 homes, and \n100,000 hectares (ha) of crops. Both land-use changes and excessive groundwater extraction \nthat causes land subsidence have worsened flooding, which is now an annual occurrence \nthroughout much of Indonesia. It is estimated that 70% of groundwater sources and 75% of \nrivers are polluted, limiting water resource sustainability and posing risks to public health. In \n2005,  5.2  million  ha  of  the  total  irrigated  area  of  6.7  million  ha,  or  78%,  was  served  by \ninfrastructure considered in good condition. As the irrigated area expanded to 7.2 million ha in \n2010, the area in good condition shrank to only 3.5 million ha, or 48%. Climate change will \nfurther challenge Indonesia\u2019s WRM as water scarcity worsens in some areas, extreme weather \nevents become more frequent, and rainfall patterns become less favorable for agriculture. \n \n6.  Institutional and management challenges. Many of the same problems affect both \nWSS and WRM as water challenges become increasingly interdependent and confront policy \nmakers  with  trade-offs.  Institutional  arrangements  and  fiscal  options  for  water  operations, \nmaintenance, and management need to be strengthened. The regulatory framework for WSS is \ninadequate to support sector development. WSS operations generally fail to recover operation \nand maintenance costs, and farmers pay no irrigation service fees. Technical and administrative \ncapacity constraints hamper effective planning, management, and development as Indonesia\u2019s \ndecentralized  government  structure  heightens  capacity  challenges.  District,  provincial,  and \ncentral government roles and fund flows need to be clearer and better coordinated, and different \nagencies\u2019 program, policy, and management responsibilities harmonized. Although economic \ngrowth has been robust, planning and infrastructure investment have been inadequate to meet \nrising water sector demands. Importantly, the private sector has been underutilized and should \nplay a larger role not only for WSS but increasingly for WRM. \n \n7.  Improved WRM is vital for WSS and economic growth. Increased bulk water supply is \nneeded to (i) support WSS expansion as PDAMs restructure; (ii) meet growing municipal, \nindustrial, and agricultural service demand; and (iii) ease overreliance on groundwater. An \nurgent  concern  is  to  enhance  the  policy  framework  and  capacity  toward  facilitating  the \ndevelopment  of  new  bulk  water  sources  and  improving  water  allocation  among  competing \ndemands.  The  water\u2013food\u2013energy  nexus  provides  an  important  paradigm  to  assess  the \neconomic trade-offs in sound water policy and planning decisions. Agriculture uses 88% of the \ndeveloped water supply in Indonesia, and food security is a growing government priority. In \n2011, the government called for rice production to increase by 10 million tons, or by 15%, to \naddress food  insecurity,4 and the  MP3EI  prioritizes  (i)  security  in  both  the  production  and \nconsumption of food and (ii) developing new food-production areas, in particular outside of Java. \nEnergy demand is increasing at twice the rate of GDP growth, and water is critical to develop \nhydropower and service thermal energy production, which is expanding rapidly. Energy typically \ncomprises 50% of the cost of urban water supply. The water\u2013food\u2013energy nexus provides an \ninformed and transparent framework for determining and resolving trade-offs to meet rising \ndemand while addressing sustainability. This type of analysis is needed to support the CWA and \nensure sound water planning that will achieve the goals of Indonesia\u2019s MP3EI and the next \nRPJMN. \n \n8.  Ongoing ADB activities. ADB has a well-developed and growing water program, with \nboth sovereign and private sector operations. The TA project Water Supply and Sanitation \n                                                \n4  Presidential Decree 5/2011, Security in National Rice Production in Facing Extreme Climate Condition. Jakarta. \n ", "  3\nSector Development is helping BAPPENAS to assess WSS and develop a policy road map.5 \nADB supports sanitation with the ongoing Metropolitan Sanitation Management and Health \nProject 6  and  a  new  sanitation  project  under  preparation. 7  The  TA  project  Institutional \nStrengthening for the Water Resources Sector is reviewing role-sharing by national, provincial, \nand district governments for irrigation and river basin management to improve coordination.8 \nThe Directorate General of Water Resources under the Ministry of Public Works is adopting \nirrigation reforms based on experience from the Participatory Irrigation Sector Project.9 The \nIntegrated  Citarum  Water  Resources  Management  Investment  Program  provides \ncomprehensive support to the government to advance river basin planning and management \nthrough a 15-year commitment.10 Capacity building is an important part of ADB\u2019s program, and \nADB TA for Supporting Water Operators\u2019 Partnerships facilitates water practitioner exchange to \ndevelop  PDAM  capacity.11 ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  has  invested  in \nJakarta\u2019s water supply concessionaires and has other water-related proposals pending.12 ADB \ndirectly  supports  the  MP3EI  through  3-year  policy-based  lending  for  the  Inclusive  Growth \nthrough Improved Connectivity Program.13 ADB has a robust and growing water program but \nwould  benefit  from  a  more  coordinated  and  integrated  approach  across  subsectors  and \nassistance modalities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be improved water planning and investment. The outcome will be an \nupdated strategic framework for water planning, management, and development. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: country water assessment and strategic planning. Output 1 will have \nthree activities. The primary activity will be to develop a CWA that aligns with the government\u2019s \nMP3EI to integrate water priorities more fully into development planning. The priorities of ADB's \nWater Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 will also guide CWA development.14 The approach will use \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2011.

ADB\u2019s strategic vision for water calls for CWAs in key \nclient countries, and ADB has prepared their generic outline and terms of reference, which will be revised in \nconsultation with the government to ensure that they reflect government priorities and the MP3EI. \n ", "4  \nexisting water sector information and analysis, where available, from the government, ADB, and \nother development partners and integrate them with the CWA\u2019s analytical framework. The CWA \nwill address national water policy issues and include detailed water sector plans to support the \nspecific  MP3EI  economic  development  strategies  for  the  Java  and  the  Sumatra  regional \ncorridors  (which  generate  over  80%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  GDP)  and  up  to  two  other  regional \ncorridors.15 The CWA will synthesize sector and subsector issues using a holistic approach to \nevaluate trade-offs and issues across sectors. It will include analysis of the water\u2013food\u2013energy \nnexus to develop regional corridor water sector plans based on the MP3EI. The regional water \nplans for the economic corridors will include recommendations for investment, management, \nand  institutional  and  policy  reform  to  support  specific  regional  growth  strategies.  Local \ngovernments will be involved in developing the regional water sector plans related to the MP3EI \nto ensure alignment with local initiatives. \n \n11.  The second activity responds to the government\u2019s request for assistance to develop \nwater-related sections of the new RPJMN. The CWA will provide the analytical basis, and the \nTA  will  produce  relevant  sections  of  the  RPJMN  and  support  background  studies  and \npresentations. For both the CWA and RPJMN, the TA will support extensive consultations with \nnational and local governments, development partners, civil society, the private sector, and \nother stakeholders. The third activity will prepare an ADB water operational plan for 2014\u20132020 \nfor Indonesia, which will guide ADB water loans and grants program, ensuring that it aligns with \nthe  government\u2019s  priorities  and  the  ADB  Water  Operational  Plan.  The  Indonesia  water \noperational plan will integrate WSS and WRM perspectives and address interdependent issues \nthat  are  becoming  increasingly  urgent  and  should  be  reflected  under  an  integrated  ADB \napproach. The  plan  will  address both  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  programs  and facilitate \ndialogue and the government\u2019s engagement with ADB\u2019s long-term water investment program. \n \n12.  Output 2: capacity development and knowledge transfer. An important priority to \nimprove  water  planning,  management,  and  development  is  strengthened  capacity  and \nknowledge transfer. The main activity under output 2 will be Indonesia Water Learning Week \n(WLW), which will accompany CWA development. WLW will be an international event to bring \ntogether  senior  government  policy  makers,  development  partners,  civil  society,  the  private \nsector, and other stakeholders. It will be an opportunity to (i) develop a common perspective on \nwater sector challenges; (ii) conduct policy dialogue on the government\u2019s priorities to improve \nwater sector planning, management and development; (iii) validate the draft CWA; and (iv) \ntransfer knowledge on key issues. Using national and international resource persons, WLW will \nraise awareness and develop commitment to support the CWA's reform recommendations. ADB \nhas  discussed  WLW  with  development  partners,  which  have  indicated  their  support  and \nintended participation. \n \n13.  The second activity under output 2 will develop capacity and transfer knowledge through \nexisting training programs and domestic and international seminars for government counterparts \non water issues addressed through the CWA. This output may include specialized  in situ \ntraining and the development of training materials for needs identified in consultation with the \ngovernment. The output will develop at least one knowledge product related to the CWA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,600,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Netherlands  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and \n                                                \n15 The additional regional corridors that will have water sector plans prepared under the TA will be selected in \nconsultation with the government during the TA inception mission.  \n ", "  5\nadministered by ADB. The Government of Indonesia will provide support in the form of office \naccommodation, counterpart staff, a national steering committee, and a technical working group. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The  Directorate  of  Water  Resources  and  Irrigation  under  BAPPENAS  will  be  the \nexecuting agency, and the Ministry of Public Works will be the implementing agency. A national \nsteering committee chaired by BAPPENAS will be established to guide policy for the CWA and \nWLW. It will include the Ministry of Public Works, the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, \nand other ministries.16 BAPPENAS will manage inputs to the RPJMN, which is under its purview, \nand be responsible for coordinating TA outputs. The TA will establish, in addition to the national \nsteering committee, a technical working group of line agencies and local government for the \nCWA and WLW. BAPPENAS has substantial experience implementing ADB TAs. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  require  117  person-months  of  consulting  services  (26  person-months \ninternational and 91 person-months national) over an implementation period of 16 months \nstarting in September 2013, with an additional 3 months for TA closing. A firm will be recruited \nfor the CWA and WLW using (i) quality- and cost-based selection at a ratio of 90:10 and (ii) a \nsimplified technical proposal. Additional individual consultants may be recruited as needed, and \nlump  sum  contracts  for  discrete  outputs  may  be  used.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). The terms of reference are in Appendix 3. Procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), and the procured equipment will \nbe turned over to the government upon TA completion. TA funds will support workshops, \nseminars, and other capacity development, as well as the travel of ADB staff to participate in \nrelated  TA  events.  All  disbursements  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  The TA is also designed to provide a platform for discussion and advisory services for \nADB\u2019s water operations. ADB will meet frequently with government officials to discuss TA \nprogress and output application. TA outputs and lessons will be disseminated through (i) the \nWLW;  (ii)  workshops  and  conferences  in  Indonesia  and  abroad;  (iii)  consultation  with \ndevelopment partners, the private sector, and civil society; (iv) ADB's water community of \npractice; and (v) at least one new knowledge product. Workshops will vet outputs from the \nCWAs and its water sector plans for selected economic corridors under the MP3EI. ADB and, \nthrough the national steering committee and BAPPENAS, the government will monitor and \nevaluate the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund under \nthe  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  Improving Water  Planning,  Management,  and \nDevelopment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n16 The Ministry of Public Works comprises the Directorate General of Water Resources and the Directorate for \nHuman Settlements, which are responsible for WSS. The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs is responsible \nfor the MP3EI. Other ministries\u2014such as environment, forestry, agriculture, and health\u2014and local governments \nwill likely participate on the national steering committee, as will be confirmed during the TA inception mission.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved water  Increased government  Annual reporting from the  The government \nplanning and  financing for the water sector  Coordinating Ministry of  continues to prioritize \ninvestment   by 12% by 2017 (baseline:  Economic Affairs,  water as integral to its \n  $2.45 billion in 2013)  BAPPENAS, the Ministry  economic \n  of Finance, and relevant  development \nGovernment planning and  line ministries  planning. \nwater investments in the     \neconomic corridors of the  ADB and development  The government \nMP3EI 2011\u20132025 reflect  partner economic  continues \nCWA recommendations by  evaluation and reporting  development \n2016  planning through the \n  MP3EI and the \nRPJMN. \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nAn updated  Corridor water sector plans  Annual reporting from  The government \nstrategic  endorsed by the MP3EI  BAPPENAS, relevant line  demands strategic \nframework for  oversight committee and  ministries, and the TA  water planning \nwater planning,  steering committee by the end  technical working group  assistance \nmanagement, and  2014    recommendations \ndevelopment    ADB review missions and  and is willing to \nCWA and TA outputs  evaluation  implement them. \nintegrated by BAPPENAS into     \nthe RPJMN, 2015\u20132019 by Q3  Reviews and evaluation   \n2014  from development \n  partners \nGovernment endorsement of   \ntwo TA policy \nrecommendations, \nimplemented by the end 2014 \n \nADB adoption of the Indonesia \nwater operational plan, 2014\u2013\n2020 by Q3 2014 \n \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
