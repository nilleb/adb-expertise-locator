The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare the Agricultural Land Improvement Project to \nincrease agricultural productivity and profitability in the northern regions of Issyk Kul, Naryn,  \nTalas, and Chui oblasts. The project is included in ADB\u2019s Kyrgyz Republic: Country Strategy \nand Program Update (2006\u20132008)2 as a proposed loan for 2008.  \n \n2.  The ADB Fact-Finding Mission3 (the mission) visited the Kyrgyz Republic from 20 to 30 \nNovember 2006. The purpose of the mission was to (i) gather information on the proposed \nproject; (ii) assess the need of ADB assistance for the proposed project; and (iii) discuss with \nthe Government the objectives, costs, consulting services needs, implementation arrangements, \nand schedule for project processing. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was prepared \nand signed by the Government.  \n \n3.  Project Classification. The proposed classification is: sector: agriculture and natural \nresources with subsector: environment and biodiversity; theme: sustainable economic growth \nwith subtheme: developing rural areas; theme: environmental sustainability; with subtheme: \nnatural resources conservation; and targeting classification: general intervention. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Despite continuing urbanization, the country remains a predominantly rural society, with \nagriculture and animal husbandry providing most employment. What happens to these sectors \nwill  continue  to  determine  the  welfare  of  the  rural  population  for  many  years  to  come, \nnotwithstanding  the  importance  of  other  attributes  of  welfare  (access  to  education,  health \nservices, energy, etc.) to the production dimension of rural livelihoods.  \n \n5.  The agriculture sector is very important to the country\u2019s economy. It accounts for more \nthan 33% (average for 2000\u20132004) of gross domestic product (GDP), 50% of employment (75% \nin rural areas), and 11% of exports. Of the total land area of 19.6 million hectares (ha), the \nlargest amount, at 47%, is pasture land. Only about 7% of the country\u2019s land is arable, of which \nabout 80% is irrigated. To date, the majority of land is used in an irrational manner, with a low \nreturn per hectare, and decreasing soil fertility. \n \n6.  Since  1996,  agricultural  growth  has  increasingly  been  driven  by  private  small  farm \nproduction. Average yields increased substantially between 1996 and 2004 (by 24% for grains, \n61% for vegetables, 13% for cotton, and 8% for milk). During the same period, gross output \nincreased by 8% for grains, 55% for vegetables, 95% for cotton, and 34% for milk. The share of \nproduction from state farms has declined from 22% in 1995 to 6% in 2004. With the emergence \nsince 1999 of slightly more commercially oriented small private farms, the share of production \nfrom household plots has declined, from 65% in 1995 to 40% in 2004. \n \n7.  Land Degradation. Lying within the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountain ranges, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic is largely defined by the mountain ecosystems that cover some 90% of the territory.  \nApproximately 14% of the population lives in the high mountain regions of the country (above \n1,500  meters  in  elevation),  and  mountains  dominate  all  aspects  of  life:  economic,  social, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 8 December 2006.  \n2   ADB. 2005. Kyrgyz Republic: Country Strategy and Update (2006\u20132008). Manila. \n3  The mission consisted of Robert Everitt, mission leader, and Cholpon Mambetova, project implementation officer, \nKyrgyz Resident Mission.  \n ", "2   \nenvironmental, and cultural. The country\u2019s mountain ecosystems are diverse and extremely \nfragile, and those who live in the high mountain regions are among the poorest and least well-\nserved by public institutions. Approximately 90% of the country\u2019s agricultural lands can be \ndefined as lands prone to desertification, and over 40% of farmlands are already considered \ndegraded. Land degradation matters greatly in the Kyrgyz Republic, as agriculture is the main \nactivity of the rural population (accounting for 75% of the poor and about 80% of the extremely \npoor). Land degradation has led to decreased fertility of arable and natural forage lands, and \ndecreased animal breeding capacity, resulting in decreasing incomes, declining quality of life, \nand migration from villages to urban areas, both within the country and abroad. \n \n8.  The case for continued support of broad-based development of agriculture (including \nlivestock) is based on the positive performance of the sector during the last 10 years and its \nimpact on poverty reduction. Increased agricultural output has been the main driver of the \nsignificant poverty reduction that has taken place in recent years, and the increase has occurred \nin spite of the fragmentation and primitivization of the sector. Poverty reduction is at the core of \nADB\u2019s mandate, and ADB needs to remain engaged in rural areas. Sustained (and preferably \nimproving) agro-pastoral output makes rural communities viable, and justifies investments in \nother components of rural welfare (e.g. sanitation and health). A rural poverty reduction strategy \nmust be based on improved land management, but cannot neglect the need for better transport \ninfrastructure, more access to credit, better marketing, or creation of a dynamic agroprocessing \nsubsector. Constraints in these areas exist in the country, but the basic constraint is poor on-\nfarm and pasture land management. Improvements in land management require a combination \nof physical improvements and institutional and policy framework reforms.  \n \n9.   ADB  Interventions.  To  address  land  degradation  and  support  sustainable  land \nmanagement,  ADB  is  leading  the  Central  Asian  Countries  Initiative  for  Land  Management \n(CACILM), a 10-year program of country-driven action and resource mobilization (July 2006\u2013\nJune  2016).  CACILM  supports  a  sequenced  set  of  high-priority  activities  to  achieve  (i) \nstrengthened policy, legislative, and institutional frameworks, creating conditions conducive for \nsustainable land management; (ii) increased capacity of key institutions responsible for planning \nand implementing sustainable land management interventions; and (iii) improved sustainable \nland management and natural systems through the combined impact of appropriate enabling \nconditions and targeted project investments. Under CACILM, the Kyrgyz Republic has prepared \na National Programming Framework (NPF) for Sustainable Land Management. The proposed \nproject fits well within the goals and objectives of the NPF.  \n \n10.  ADB's knowledge contribution in the agriculture, environment, and natural resources \nsector  includes,  among  other  ADB-financed  initiatives:  (i)  TA  4405-KGZ:  Study  on  Pricing \nSystems and Cost Recovery Mechanisms for Irrigation; (ii) TA 4408-KGZ: Study of the Impact of \nLand  Reform  on  Agriculture,  Poverty  Reduction,  and  Environment;  (iii)  TA  4409-KGZ: \nAgricultural Strategy Formulation; and (iv) CACILM. The key results and lessons from these \nprojects provide a good basis for implementation of the TA.  \n \n11.  To date, ADB has been working in Chui oblast with the Agriculture Area Development \nProject (AADP) and will be working in the Batken, Jalabad, and Osh oblasts through the \nSouthern Agriculture Area Development Project (SAADP). The AADP approach addresses a \nrange  of  issues  (drainage  and  irrigation,  access  to  credit,  advisory  services,  marketing \nagribusiness development, and equitable access to land) simultaneously, focusing intensively \non target aiyl okmatu (village government bodies representing one or more villages). AADP has \nhad a substantial and visible impact on agriculture in target aiyl okmatu where drainage and \nirrigation rehabilitation has been completed and the combined impact of all project components \n ", "3 \nis  now  visible.  AADP  has  demonstrated  the  importance  of  a  coordinated  and  integrated \napproach  to  addressing  key  constraints  and  opportunities  and  enhancing  development \neffectiveness. Many aspects of AADP\u2019s design and implementation are replicated in SAADP, \nnotably the farm development and drainage and irrigation components. Other aspects (e.g. \ncredit, agribusiness development, and marketing components) have been adapted to achieve a \ngreater  impact  more  rapidly.  SAADP  has  been  proactive  in  including  a  land  improvement \ncomponent, which addresses pasture management and orchard management constraints in the \nsouth. The reorganization of water management has also been assisted by the World Bank On-\nFarm Irrigation Project, and further reform will be supported under the Water Management \nImprovement Project.  \n \n12.  The proposed project areas are Issyk Kul, Naryn, Talas, and Chui oblasts in the northern \nKyrgyz Republic. These oblasts have a number of common issues and problems: (i)  poor \npastureland  management  practices  and  poor  pasture  infrastructure,  with  consequent \novergrazing  near  local  communities;  (ii)  poor  animal  husbandry  practices  including  weak \nbreeding and selection programs, and poor quality of veterinary care; (iii) declining productivity \non rainfed lands in terms of yield and quality of crops, resulting from a variety of factors \nincluding lack of equipment and limited or no application of mineral fertilizers, herbicides, and \npesticides; (iv) declining productivity (i.e., reduced yield and reduced areas under irrigation) and \nquality of the irrigated lands in many areas due to water-logging, erosion, and compaction and \ndeclining    soil  fertility;  (v)  low  farm  incomes  due  to  high  input  costs  (e.g.,  fuel,  transport, \nagrichemicals)  and  decreases  in  commodity  prices;  (vi)  absence  of  secure  markets  and \nprocessing facilities; (vii) relatively few farmers make use of available credit because of the high \ninterest rates, relatively short repayment periods, and the need for collateral; and (viii) mixed \nsuccess with new cooperatives created to take advantage of economies of scale with respect to \nlarger land holdings and to allow for more sustainable land management practices.  \n \n13.  Project Scope. The project concept is still under consideration, but the project may \nfocus  on  improving  the  productivity  of  crop  lands,  pasture  lands,  and  animal  husbandry. \nAdditional components may need to be considered to provide advisory services, access to \ncredit, and assistance with marketing and agribusiness development. Potential interventions \nassociated with sustainable land use and crop land improvement could include (i) introduction of \nprogressive  agricultural  technologies,  including  crop  rotation,  which  enrich  soil  fertility;  (ii) \nscientifically-based application of mineral fertilizers; (iii) improvement of access to irrigation; and \n(iv) arrangements for a network of service centers in the rural areas (e.g., animal husbandry, \nagrochemical  services,  information  and  consulting  services).  With  respect  to  pasture  land \nimprovements, the following may be considered: (i) capacity building at the local, raion, and \noblast levels; (ii) rehabilitation of pasture land infrastructure (livestock droving routes, bridges, \nroads, sheds, and water structures); and (iii) specific capacity building of the Department of \nPastures of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry (MAWRPI), \nincluding creating and equipping a Pasture Inspectorate for monitoring and evaluation of the use \nof pastures and identification of degraded lands.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.   The TA will help the Government design an investment project to address constraints to \nincreasing agricultural productivity and profitability in the Issyk Kul, Naryn, Talas, and Chui \noblasts in the northern part of the Kyrgyz Republic. The outcome of the TA will be the agreed \n ", "4   \ndesign for the resulting project. The impact of the technical assistance is sustained improvement \nin the productivity of agriculture land. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will be implemented with a participatory approach from the national to the village \nlevel. It will involve the private sector (farmers, agribusiness enterprises, etc.), civil society, and \naid-funded projects. The participatory approach will be implemented through the TA steering \ncommittee, regional working groups, stakeholder workshops, focus group interviews, and the \nsocial survey and analysis in each region. An initial poverty and social impact assessment has \nbeen prepared (Appendix 2). \n \n16.  The TA will be divided into two phases. The key output in phase 1 will be a situational \nanalysis of key aspects of agriculture sector and sustainable land management, which will lead \nto an initial assessment of alternative project designs. Phase 2 will produce a detailed feasibility \nstudy with supporting social, environmental, economic, financial, and procurement analyses.  \n \n17.   The activities in phase 1 include (i) assessment of progress and lessons learned in \nprevious ADB projects in the agriculture sector; (ii) assessment of the legal and institutional \nframework; (iii)  update on the status of agricultural growth and development in each oblast; (iv) \nidentification of the key issues, constraints, and opportunities with respect to developing the \nagriculture sector; (v) assessment of current land use and land productivity; (vi) an assessment \nof  current  land  management  practices;  (vii)  institutional  and  financial  analyses  of  regional \nadministration  and  other  government  levels  and  agencies,  as  necessary;  (viii)  stakeholder \nanalysis; (ix) mapping of existing and planned development partner activities against constraints \nand opportunities; (x) initial assessment of alternative design approaches; and (xi) agreement \nwith the Government on the geographical focus and scope of the proposed project. Phase 2 will \nprepare a detailed feasibility study that will include (i) key investment activities; (ii) institutional \ndevelopment activities; and (iii) clearly identified links to existing or planned investment activities \nof the Government, private sector, nongovernment organizations, and aid partners. Special \nefforts will be made to ensure that implementation capacity exists among the relevant agencies, \nand particularly local government agencies, for efficient and effective management.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $875,000 equivalent (Appendix 3). ADB will \nfinance  $700,000  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis  through  ADB's  TA  funding  program.  The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  $175,000  equivalent  in  costs  through  in-kind \ncontributions of office accommodation, data compilation, logistical support, and counterpart staff.  \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.   MAWRPI will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A project steering committee, chaired \nby MAWRPI, with representatives from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, other relevant \ngovernment  agencies,  and  the  oblast  and/or  raion  governments  will  be  established.  It  is \nexpected that the proposed project will be effectively coordinated within the Kyrgyz Republic \nNPF for sustainable land management under CACILM. \n \n ", "5 \n20.   It is proposed that the TA be undertaken over 9 months in two phases; it is expected to \nbegin in June 2007 and be completed in February 2008. Approximately 72 person-months (24 \nperson-months  international  and  48  person-months  national)  of  consulting  services  will  be \nrequired. The proposed international experts will include a team leader-economist-institutional \nspecialist,  agriculture  economist,  pastureland  ecologist,  agronomist,  land  improvement \nspecialist, rural engineer, environment specialist, social development specialist, and others as \nneeded.  The  proposed  domestic  experts  will  include  an  economist-deputy  team  leader, \ninstitutional specialist, irrigation systems specialist, agronomist, sustainable land management \nspecialist,  agriculture-livestock  specialist,  agribusiness  specialist,  rural  sociologist, \nenvironmental specialist and others as needed. Outline terms of reference for consultants are \npresented in Appendix 4. The consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). It is \nexpected  that  a  simplified  technical  proposal  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedure (80:20 quality-cost ratio) will be adopted for recruiting the consulting firm. Office \nequipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006,  as \namended from time to time).  \n \n21.  Several participatory workshops will be held to increase participation. In each region, \nworkshops will be held at the start of phase 1 to review the agriculture situation, assess \nalternative  design  approaches,  and  discuss  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the \nconsultants. The project working group at the national level will meet at the start of phase 1 to \nguide the consultants, and at the end to reach agreement on the findings and recommendations \nand proposed activities for phase 2. In phase 2, workshops at the regional level will continue \nwhile project design is ongoing. More intensive workshops and focus group meetings will be \nheld with districts and villages in the selected focus areas and with farmers, associations, \nprivate sector, and aid-financed projects to ensure a sense of ownership of and agreement on \nthe detailed design and implementation arrangements. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for preparing the Agricultural Land Improvement Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicatorsa  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \n  Mechanisms  \nImpact        Assumption \n       \nSustained  Crop yields of  National Statistics  Project design \nimprovement in the  households increase  Committee  implemented \nproductivity of  from ____ to ____    effectively \nagricultural land       \n  Reduction in the area of  Project and Central   \ndegraded lands from  Asian Countries for \n____ to ____  Land Management \n  (CACILM) monitoring \nsystems \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nProject design and  Project design and  Final report  Effective stakeholder \nfeasibility study  feasibility study agreed  participation and \nagreed upon  by Government  ownership obtained \n \nOutputs      Risks \n       \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic: \n \nThe Country Development Strategy1 is the major conceptual document reflecting the medium-term outlook \nof the Kyrgyz Republic, determining the development of basic directions and activity of the country for \n2006\u20132010. The Country Development Strategy identifies development of agriculture and agro-processing \nas of one of the six key strategic elements of the economic growth strategy. The Joint Country Support \nStrategy currently under development by the Asian Development Bank and four other major funding \nagencies has developed a results matrix. For the agriculture and agroprocessing sector, the targeted \noutcome  is  improved  living  standards  in  rural  areas  through  strengthened  market  mechanisms  in \nproduction and processing, and increased agricultural agriculture. Poverty statistics suggest that in 1999, \n55.3%  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  population  was  poor  and  23%  extremely  poor.  By  2001,  these \npercentages had fallen to just below 50% and 13%, respectively. Fifty-five per cent of the rural population \nlived at or below the poverty level. In 2003, the figure of absolute poverty had declined further to 40.8%. \nNutrition-based poverty declined from 17.8% in 2000 to 9.4% in 2003. Poverty incidence in rural areas \ndeclined largely due to better performance of the agriculture sector and rising average wages. Poverty in \nrural areas continues to be significantly higher than in urban areas. In 2005, urban areas had 9.6% of the \nextremely poor and 31.6% of the poor, while the corresponding figures for rural areas were 15.6% and \n35.4%, respectively.  \n \nProposed interventions in pasture land management and small animal husbandry in particular involve \nlower income farmers, which suggests a strong likelihood of contributing to poverty reduction among the \npoor. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe technical assistance (TA) will require poverty analysis that is disaggregated by region (raion level) and \nby gender. The northern regions of Naryn, Talas, and Issyk Kul have relatively high levels of poverty. The \nTA will examine poverty incidence using existing data sources, supplemented through a social survey of \npotential  beneficiaries.  Both  income  and  non-income  poverty  indices  will  be  determined.  Particular \nattention  within  the stakeholder  analysis will  be given  to  profiling,  for  each  type  of  service,  the (i) \nbeneficiaries, (ii) negatively affected peoples, or (iii) unaffected socioeconomic groups. Data collected will \ninclude,  where  possible,  (i)  gender-disaggregated  demographic,  economic,  and  social  data;  (ii)  the \nincidence of poverty and vulnerable groups; (iii) ability and willingness to pay for cost recovery, and (iv) \nany adverse impacts anticipated from the project. \n \nThe project preparatory TA (PPTA) poverty analysis will focus on (i) analyzing how access to services, \nmarkets, assets, resources (especially land) and/or credit is differentiated between the poor and non-poor; \n(ii) identifying ways of improving the poverty and inequality reduction contribution of the project; and (iii) \nassessing whether vulnerable groups will be worse off as a result of the project, and the need for \nmitigating measures. The analysis will be carried out in accordance with the Poverty Handbook (2006) and \nSocial Analysis Handbook (2007). The poverty analysis will also examine the linkages between poverty \nand land degradation. \n \n                                                 \n1 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2006.
