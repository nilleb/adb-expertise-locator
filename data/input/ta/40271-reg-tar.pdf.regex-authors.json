A preparatory meeting to establish a Regional Business Roundtable1 (RBR) was held on \n3\u20134 November 2005, in Bishkek, the Kyrgyz Republic prior to the Fourth Ministerial Conference \non  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC).  The  CAREC  program  covers \nAfghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (focusing on the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region), Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. During \nthe meeting, the RBR was endorsed as a mechanism to enhance private sector participation \namong the ongoing regional cooperation programs\u2014especially CAREC. The Bishkek Action \nPlan2 summarized discussions and agreements of the RBR meeting. The action plan was \nsubmitted  to  and  discussed  at  the  CAREC  senior  officials\u2019  meeting  and  endorsed  by  the \nministerial conference. \n \n2.  It  was  agreed  at  the  preparatory  meeting  that  the  RBR  would  focus  initially  on \nchanneling the interests of member countries' private sectors to various regional cooperation \nprograms, including CAREC and the Subregional Economic Cooperation in South and Central \nAsia (formerly known as the Central and South Asia Trade and Transport Forum). Participants \nproposed that, in addition to the core activities of CAREC (trade facilitation, trade policy, energy, \nand transport), the RBR agenda focus on the financial sector and tourism.  \n \n3.  Subsequent  to  the  November  2005  RBR,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC) \nsuggested that CAREC hold a business development forum (BDF) for Central Asia in 2006 or \nearly 2007 in order to deepen awareness of the role that the private sector should play in \nregional cooperation. \n \n4.  Discussion and finalization of the activities described above will culminate in the first \nofficial meeting of the CAREC BDF in conjunction with the Fifth CAREC ministerial conference \non Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, planned for October 2006.3 The CAREC BDF \nshould be held in advance of these official meetings so that the outcome, recommendations, \nand next steps can be discussed and endorsed accordingly. In addition to the CAREC program \ncountries, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, and Turkmenistan will also be invited to attend the BDF. The \ntechnical assistance (TA) design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  To date, input from key stakeholders in the private sector has been lacking under the \nCAREC program. Despite repeated vows from ministers and senior officials to encourage more \nprivate sector participation in regional cooperation projects and activities, this proposed regional \ntechnical assistance (RETA) would be only the second private sector development initiative \nsince CAREC was launched in 1997 (the other was the CAREC's 2005 regional business \nroundtable). \n \n                                                 \n1  The Regional Business Roundtable was a joint initiative between Central Asia Regional Cooperation (CAREC) and \nthe Subregional Economic Cooperation in South and Central Asia, which was managed by ADB's South Asia \nDepartment before the realignment of the ADB's regional departments effective 1 May 2006. \n2  The Bishkek Action Plan contains the participants\u2019 ideas and agreements in terms of the RBR\u2019s vision and \nobjectives, benefits, substantive activities, key success factors, possible structures and mechanisms, and next \nsteps. \n3  The CAREC BDF initiative will be implemented by the ADB with close support from the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development with its extensive private sector experience. \n ", "2     \n6.  With the exception of one TA to date, minimal attention was devoted to private sector \ndevelopment  until  the  First  Ministerial  Conference  on  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation in March 2002, which noted that trade and transport within Central Asia and with \nother countries is vital for private sector development. Private sector development gained further \nattention at the Third Ministerial Conference on Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation in \n2004, when ministers declared in a joint ministerial statement that they \u201c... also endorsed the \nrecommendation that private sector participation in the CAREC program should be encouraged \nand facilitated.\u201d  \n \n7.  Although the CAREC program lacks direct experience in private sector development in \nthe region, various studies and forums in Central Asia offer important insights that have been \nincorporated into the design of this RETA. Among these are: \n \n(i)  One needs the right approach to the private sector. If the private sector is to be a \nmajor  source  of  funds  in  infrastructure  development,  it  must  be  invited  to \nparticipate from the moment projects are conceived.4  \n(ii)  The private sector looks for sectors with high returns and high growth.5 \n(iii)  A more vibrant Central Asia business sector depends greatly upon the public \nsector providing a conducive environment for business. This includes easing \nbarriers to the flow of people and goods, establishing effective and responsive \npublic agencies, providing a solid legal and regulatory framework to underpin the \nbusiness sector, and developing infrastructure.6   \n \n8.  The  major  conclusions  of  the  RBR  preparatory  meeting  were  that  private  sector \nrepresentation in regional cooperation meetings needed to be enhanced, and that the interests \nof the region\u2019s domestic and foreign businesses must be reflected in the various regional \ncooperation programs. The proposed BDF will focus on meeting this objective and promoting \npublic\u2013private partnerships in key projects. \n \n9.  The main objectives of the CAREC BDF meeting are as follows: \n \n(i)  To bring together public and private sector investors to identify major investment \nopportunities and inform the ministerial conference about existing barriers that \npreclude such investments; \n(ii)  To leverage the vast amount of information available in the public and donor \nsectors to support private sector investments; \n(iii)  To  identify  the  major  constraints  to  investment  in  the  target  sectors  and  to \ndevelop mechanisms to address these constraints; \n(iv)  To support the development of the hard and soft infrastructure required to foster \ngreater trade and investment activities both within CAREC and with neighboring \ncountries; \n(v)  To foster the linkages that must exist between all private sector participants in \nthe region in order to ensure the expansion of markets, the development of intra-\nregional  supply  chains,  and  the  integrated  financial  systems  that  regional \ncooperation ultimately fosters and nurtures; \n                                                 \n4  Second Workshop on Economic Cooperation in Central Asia: Challenges and Opportunities in Asia, 1999. \n5  See footnote 4.  \n6  ADB. 2004. Issues in and Options for Private Sector Development in the Central Asian Region. Manila. \n ", "  3\n(vi)  To enhance business sector involvement in the CAREC initiatives by providing \ndirect  and  regular  channels  for  the  private  sector  to  communicate  with  the \ngovernments participating in the CAREC program; and \n(vii)  To lay the groundwork for sustainable structures and institutional mechanisms to \nperpetuate the development of public\u2013private partnerships and private sector \ninvolvement in regional cooperation projects. \n \n10.  The  proposed  CAREC  BDF  meeting  in  October  will  examine  the  region\u2019s  priority \ninvestment opportunities and how to overcome the existing obstacles to investment in five \nsectors identified in the Bishkek Action Plan, namely: (i) energy (oil and gas), (ii) mining, (iii) \nbanking and finance; (iv) agribusiness, and (v) tourism.  \n \n11.  For each of the five sectors, and in close conjunction with all key players\u2014the business \ncommunities both within and outside the region, multilateral institutions involved in the CAREC \nprogram (i.e., the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Monetary \nFund, Islamic Development Bank, United Nations Development Programme, and World Bank),7 \ninvestment  banks,  investment  promotion  agencies,  and  others\u2014it  is  proposed  to  produce \nsector-specific  investment  materials.  These  materials  will  be  carefully  produced  by  the \nsecretariat  in  cooperation  with  selected  multilateral  institutions  to  ensure  that  they  are  of \nmaximum value to the business community.  \n \n12.  In addition to the five sectors, and in line with the directions outlined in the Bishkek \nAction Plan, the CAREC BDF will consider a panel discussion on the critical area of enhancing \ntrade  and  investment  in  the  region.  Accordingly,  the  CAREC  BDF  can  make  concrete \nrecommendations to CAREC on required improvements in trade and investment-related areas.  \n \n13.  It is proposed that another panel discussion be held on the key policy reforms required \nto  strengthen  the  infrastructure  base  in  the  CAREC  region,  issues  relating  to  financing \ninfrastructure, and the potential for public\u2013private partnerships in infrastructure.  \n \n14.  At the at the start of the respective sectoral discussion groups at the CAREC BDF, \nselected  investment  banks\u2014and  possibly  multinational  and  large  domestic  corporations \noperating in the CAREC region\u2014will provide introductory presentations on the structure and key \nissues of the energy, mining, agriculture, tourism, and finance sectors, and on potential cross-\nborder investment opportunities. In addition, the individual discussion groups will help identify \nvarious legal and regulatory barriers to cross-border or regional investment in these sectors. \nThe key findings put forward by the investors will be validated by key private sector players in \nthese industries. The CAREC BDF will then formulate specific proposals to reduce impediments \nto regional private sector development to the senior officials\u2019 meeting and ministerial conference \nfor consideration and action. \n \n15.  Recognizing the key role to be played by the CAREC BDF in fostering an enabling \nenvironment for the private sector and strengthening the role of the business community in \nregional cooperation programs, the following significant contributions of the CAREC BDF to the \nbusiness community have been identified: \n \n(i)  Serving as a focal point or intermediary between the public and private sectors in \nthe CAREC program; \n                                                 \n7  The multilateral institutions are not contributing financially to this BDF, but they are also involved in planning the \nevent and will likely contribute experts as panelists and moderators. \n ", "4     \n(ii)  Fostering greater coordination and networking amongst chambers of commerce \nand the general business sectors in the Central Asian countries; \n(iii)  Creating greater awareness of the common challenges and obstacles of doing \nbusiness in Central Asia and undertaking concerted action, particularly in cross-\nborder facilitation issues, both within Central Asia and with neighbors; \n(iv)  Achieving  \u201ceconomies  of  scale\u201d  in  investment  opportunities,  training,  and \nleverage of donor inputs and business-related activities; \n(v)  Establishing  critical  links  with  major  international  organizations  supporting \nCAREC; and \n(vi)  Creating another point of access for CAREC BDF members to public agencies at \nthe national, regional, and international levels. \n \n16.  The CAREC BDF meeting is a complex exercise requiring a wide range of activities for \nsuccess. The following success factors for the CAREC BDF have been identified: \n \n(i)  A considerable amount of groundwork must be completed in order to ensure a \nproductive and fruitful CAREC BDF meeting; in particular, suitable participants \nmust be identified; \n(ii)  The ADB CAREC Unit and CAREC regional cooperation officers at the various \nADB resident missions must take the lead in organizing and coordinating many \ndifferent events. Current staff resources need to be supported by temporary staff \nmembers  to  assist  with  contacting  potential  speakers  and  participants  and \nrelated activities. \n(iii)  The  planning  and  implementation  of  the  CAREC  BDF  must  be  done  in \ncollaboration with other multilateral institution partners; \n(iv)  In order for the CAREC BDF initiatives to succeed, a mechanism within CAREC \nmust be developed to involve the private sector actively at various levels in the \nregional cooperation process on a consistent basis; \n(v)  Public sector activities should, where possible, be refocused to explicitly take into \naccount constructive private sector perspectives;  \n(vi)  Considerable effort goes into preparing BDF industry sector briefs and other \nsupporting materials; and \n(vii)  Required resources must be mobilized to cover all aspects of the meeting (as \nwas the case with the RBR meeting in November 2005). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The impact of the RETA will be improved investment, trade, and transport conditions in \nthe CAREC region resulting from the establishment of an effective forum for private sector \nfeedback and input into CAREC. The outcome of the RETA will be that the business community \nwill be able to participate more fully in regional investment projects in the five priority sectors in \nthe CAREC economies. The RETA will support the actions called for in the Bishkek Action Plan \nin November 2005 at the preparatory meeting of the RBR. The RETA will also support the \npreparation required to ensure a successful first meeting of the CAREC BDF in October 2006. \nThis meeting will aim to achieve the following objectives: (i) establishment of an effective public\u2013\nprivate sector partnership mechanism for regional cooperation in Central Asia; (ii) improvement \nof  the  business  environment  (government  policies,  regulations,  and  procedures);  and  (iii) \ncapacity building of private sector participants to undertake regional business. \n \n ", "  5\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n18.  Extensive consultations with the CAREC member countries and participating multilateral \ninstitutions will be required to plan and successfully hold the CAREC BDF. Consultations with all \nof the key stakeholders, including those from the private sector, have been ongoing since March \n2006 when the initial concept paper on the CAREC BDF was drafted. The concept paper \nreceived  endorsement  at  the  CAREC  senior  officials\u2019  meeting  in  April  2006,  which  led  to \nsubsequent discussions and consensus building among stakeholders about the scope, agenda, \nand overall planning for the BDF. The basic structure of the CAREC BDF meeting under \npreparation is presented in Appendix 3; the basic tasks for the RETA consultants are presented \nin Appendix 4. \n \n19.  The key activities of the RETA will be: (i) preparation of background and issues papers \nfor  the  five  key  sectors  to  be  discussed  at  the  October  2006  CAREC  BDF  meeting;  (ii) \nestablishment  of  linkages  with  other  regional  business  groups  and  national  business \nassociations, (iii) implementation of all steps required to prepare for the October 2006 CAREC \nBDF meeting; (iv) holding the October 2006 CAREC BDF meeting, and (v) preparation of \ndocumentation to support the development of the CAREC BDF after the meeting and to report \nto the CAREC ministerial conference.8  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing Plan \n20.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $200,000 equivalent. The RETA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional \nCooperation Fund and administered by ADB.  Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are \ngiven in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the RETA. The PRC Ministry of Finance and \nMinistry of Commerce will be the Implementing Agencies. The RETA will be implemented over 4 \nmonths (August 2006\u2013November 2006). The final RETA report will be finished by the end of \nNovember 2006. The RETA will be administered by the CAREC Unit, with ADB's Private Sector \nOperations Department providing overall guidance. \n \n22.  The RETA will require the services of a national consultant with an expertise in events \nmanagement from August\u2013October 2006.9 The consultant will be responsible for preparing for \nand managing the October 2006 CAREC BDF. The consultant will assist with the development, \nimplementation, promotion, and operation of the BDF, including coordinating closely with the \nImplementing Agencies of the RETA, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \n                                                 \n8  The preparatory RBR, held in 2005, was originally intended to set up a fairly \u201cregular\u201d business forum for the \nCAREC private sector. The preparatory meeting discussed options for the RBR being held biannually or annually, \nand the first \u201cfull\u201d meeting of the RBR was going to decide this. However, subsequent discussions with multilateral \ninstitutions and the PRC Government led to the BDF concept, and hence the RBR has been folded into the BDF. \nThe BDF will hopefully become a regular mechanism for private sector inputs to and participation in the CAREC \nprogram, provided that the member governments and other multilateral institutions concur and that sufficient \ninterest and ownership is demonstrated by the private sector. \n9  Under the CAREC umbrella RETA, a private sector specialist/international consultant was engaged to provide \noverall guidance in preparing for the BDF. The consultant is responsible for consultations with key stakeholders; \npreparing sector background briefs, other documentation relevant to the BDF discussions, and a post-BDF \nstrategic action plan; and assisting with organizing and implementing logistics for the meeting participants. \n ", "6     \nand the All China Federation of Industry and Commerce. The consultant will be recruited by \nADB on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.
