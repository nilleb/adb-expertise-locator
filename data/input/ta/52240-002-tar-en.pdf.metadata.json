The ensuing project is to support the government of Mongolia in expanding renewable \nenergy. In spite of vast renewable energy potential, Mongolia depends on 93% of total electricity \nproduction from coal fired thermal power plants. Coal has also been used as the primary source \nfor heating. As a result, the energy sector becomes the major contributor to large greenhouse gas \nemissions and serious air pollution in the country. The air pollution level in Ulaanbaatar and other \ntowns have become worse than that in cities such as Beijing and New Delhi. UNICEF warned that \nthis has become the public health crisis, especially among children. Nevertheless, the use of coal \ncannot be reduced to meet growing domestic demand for electricity and heating. To be worse, \nthe peak demand for electricity has almost been reaching to the present generation capacity limit. \nUnder the situation, the country has overcome any power shortfall through more expensive power \nimport from Russia. Thus, the energy security and social and economic impacts have been toward \nconflicting and complicating situation.      \n \n2.   To tackle the dilemma, the government issued the State Policy on Energy, 2015\u20132030 to \nincrease the share of renewable energy to 20% by 2023 and 30% by 2030. ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy and country operations business plan (COBP) for Mongolia responded to this \npriority to expand renewable energy even in remote and less developed regions, and to enable \nair quality and carbon footprint improvements.1 Subsequently, the government\u2019s mid-term plan for \n2019\u20132023 includes concrete activities for renewable energy development.2 For this purpose, this \ntransaction technical assistance (TA) was programmed for 2019 and the ensuing loan project for \n2021 in the COBP, 2020\u20132021.Given the strategy and rationale, following are the project outputs \nof the ensuing project: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Transmission strengthened to help evacuate more renewable energy to grid.    \n(ii) Output 2: Pilot pumped storage hydropower generation assessed for detailed engineering \nstudies.  \n(iii) Output 3: Pilot geothermal heat and power generation assessed for detailed engineering \nstudies.  \n(iv) Output 4: Advance heating technologies deployed.  \n \n3.   The project impact will be increased renewable energy capacity, and the outcome will be \nincreased and diversified clean energy supply schemes. \n \n4.  The ensuing project is estimated to cost $100 million. ADB will consider a project loan of \n$50.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and the balance is expected to be supported \nby cofinanciers and/or the government.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The TA will help the government prepare the project. The TA will refine the project scope \nby  incorporating  international  best  practices,  innovative  solutions,  and  conduct  technical, \nsafeguards, economic, financial, and other due diligence requirements.3 \n \n1  ADB. 2017.

Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,335,000, of which (i) $1,300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund (ACEF) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility, to be administered by ADB.4 The government will provide the balance through in-kind \ncontributions.  The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n8.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, office supplies, access to documents and information, secretarial assistance, \nand other in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n \n4  ACEF was established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "3 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. The \nMinistry of Energy, as the executing agency, will be responsible for clearing domestic project \nprocessing requirements, guiding TA activities, coordinating government agencies and relevant \norganizations,  and  reviewing  and  commenting  on  the  consultant  outputs.  As  the  project \nimplementing  agencies,  the  National  Power  Transmission  Grid,  a  state-owned  joint  stock \ncompany, and the National Renewable Energy Center will be involved in the TA activities. All TA \nfinanced goods and works shall be procured in accordance with ADB Procurement Policy and the \nProcurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nassociated instructions if any.

ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.5 The TA will finance \napproximately 30 person-months of international consultants and 12 person-months of national \nconsultants. ADB will select an international consulting firm/association for a team leader and \nengineering experts based on the quality- and cost-based selection method using a 90:10 quality\u2013\ncost ratio with simplified technical proposals.6 The TA will also apply the individual consultant \nselection  to  recruit  non-engineering  international  consultants  for  (a)  financial  analysis  and \nmanagement,  (b)  economic  analysis  and  evaluation,  (c)  environmental  assessment  and \nmanagement, (d) social development, (e) environment, (f) climate change assessment, and (g) \nprocurement management.7 The consulting team will refine the project scope by incorporating \ninternational best practices and conduct technical, safeguards, economic, financial, and other due \ndiligence to meet government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s project processing requirements.\n \n5 Terms of Reference for Consultants (Appendix 2). \n6 The output-based contract will be given to the firm.  \n7 These areas are often uninternalized within engineering firms and subcontracted by them.   \n ", "4        Appendix 1 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Amount \nA.
