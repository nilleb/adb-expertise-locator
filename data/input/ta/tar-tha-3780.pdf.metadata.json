During the development of the Country Strategy and Program (CSP) Update, 2002-\n2004, provision for  a project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the North-Northeast \nRegion Area Development Project was included.  A TA fact-finding mission was subsequently \nfielded  in  September  2001  and  held  discussions  with  the  officials  of  the  Public  Debt \nManagement Office (PDMO), the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB), \nthe Department of Highways, the National Statistics Office (NSO), local government authorities \n(LGAs),  and  stakeholder  groups.  The  Mission  reached  broad  understanding  with  the \nGovernment on the TA, with respect to its objectives, scope, cost estimates and financing plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of references for consulting services. The TA for $1.0 \nmillion was processed and approved by the President on 26 November 2001. \n \n2.  Since approval of the Project, Thailand has reduced its foreign currency borrowing \nprogram, and the Ministry of Finance has intimated that, at this time, it does not intend to borrow \nfor area development projects. \n \n3.  In accordance with Section 18 of the Operations Manual, the validity of a TA lapses \nautomatically after 12 months from the date of approval unless the TA letter is signed or the \nvalidity is extended for a further period. In view of the reasons cited in para. 2, no request for \nextension of validity will be forthcoming and the TA automatically lapsed on 26 November 2002. \n \n4.  NESDB, as the Executing Agency, has been informed accordingly.
