The countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) are committed to more closely \nlinking both their markets and people, while simultaneously pursuing greater integration into the \nglobal economy. The increase in connectivity that has occurred\u2014through transport linkages and \ninfrastructure\u2014has highlighted the importance of complementary measures related to policies \nand  institutions,  including  trade  facilitation,  which  has  emerged  as  a  key  element  to  spur \ninvestment and economic growth in the subregion. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nproposed  formulation  of  an  action  plan  for  trade  facilitation  and  investment,  and  this  was \nendorsed at the first GMS Summit, held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in 2002. The fourth meeting \nof the GMS Trade Facilitation Working Group (TFWG), held in November 2004, discussed the \nstrategic direction and elements of the action plan, and a request was subsequently made to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for support in formulating the plan.1 The resulting Strategic \nFramework for Action on Trade Facilitation and Investment in the GMS (SFA-TFI) was endorsed \nat  the  second  GMS  Summit,  held  on  5  July  2005  in  Kunming,  Yunnan  province,  PRC. \nConcomitantly, closer economic relations between GMS economies, and their integration into \nthe global economy, have underscored the importance of strengthening capacity for trade policy \nmaking and negotiations. Trade-related capacity building, in the form of institution building, \ntraining, and research activities, has received attention globally and at the GMS level. Areas of \nvital relevance to deeper trade integration include policy and institutional issues related to the \ntreatment of border and behind-border issues, and the development of policy stances and \nnegotiation capacities in relation to the world trading system and free trade agreements. \n \n2.  Trade facilitation and capacity building for trade are among the priority thrusts in the \nregional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  (RCSP)  (2004\u20132008)  for  the  GMS.2  Trade \nfacilitation,  broadly  defined,  encompasses  customs  procedures,  trade  infrastructure, \ntransportation and trade logistics, and measures designed to facilitate the movement of goods \nand people. Since its establishment in Thailand in February 2000, the International Institute for \nTrade and Development (ITD) has strived to enhance the trade-related capacity of developing \ncountries, and GMS countries in particular. ADB is supporting trade facilitation and capacity \nbuilding in the GMS through provision of regional technical assistance (TA). This TA has two \nparts: (i) Part 1 focuses on support to implement SFA-TFI, and (ii) Part 2 on capacity building for \ntrade. Management clearance for the TA concept paper was obtained on 21 July 2005 for Part \n1. The concept paper for Part 2 was in the RCSP (2004\u20132008). The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3\n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Need for a Coherent Framework. In its broadest sense, trade facilitation is part of an \noverall  trade  strategy  that  lowers  transaction  costs  by  easing  border  impediments  and \naddressing logistical issues. The SFA-TFI has identified four priority areas critical to improving \ntrade facilitation: customs procedures, inspection and quarantine, trade logistics, and business \nmobility.4 The GMS countries have taken significant steps in trade facilitation, but progress \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to Support the Development of the Action Plan on Trade and Investment \nFacilitation in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila (TA 6231-REG, approved on 10 February). \n2  ADB. 2004. The GMS beyond Borders \u2013 Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program 2004-2008. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 18 August 2005. \n4  Issues related to transportation infrastructure and the facilitation of vehicles are covered by the GMS Cross Border \nTransport  Agreement  and  is  supported  by  a  complementary  TA:  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  for \nImplementation of the Greater Mekong Subregion Cross Border Transport Agreement. Manila (TA 6307-REG, \napproved on 6 March). ", "2   \namong them is varied. Because many ongoing and sometimes overlapping activities deal with \ndifferent aspects of trade facilitation, a holistic approach is needed. Development of the SFA-TFI \nwas a response to the need to introduce a coherent framework. The SFA-TFI takes into account \nand  complements  ongoing  initiatives.  Coordination  is  important,  because  individual  GMS \ncountries are signatories to many international conventions or agreements, the implementation \nof which will have long-term implications as the GMS becomes increasingly integrated. \n \n4.  Operational  Impediments  and  Lack  of  Integrated  Response.  In  pursuing  trade \nfacilitation, GMS countries have made considerable efforts to align their domestic practices with \ninternational conventions, but their capacity for implementation varies significantly. To enhance \nthe competitiveness of the subregion, development of physical infrastructure and streamlined \nborder formalities must be matched with parallel development of the trade logistics sector,5 \nincluding service providers. Trade facilitation was often viewed as an industry or sector-specific \nissue. In the process of formulating the SFA-TFI, commerce and trade ministries from GMS \ncountries, most of which were responsible for coordinating trade facilitation work, took the lead \nrole in coordinating and consulting with various line agencies. The ministries of commerce from \nCambodia, PRC, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Thailand; Ministry of Trade from Viet \nNam; and Ministry of Planning and Economic Development from Myanmar have been formally \ndesignated as trade facilitation focal points in the GMS, and are thus the leading GMS country \nrepresentatives participating in the TFWG meetings. They will play a critical role in SFA-TFI \nimplementation, for which their capacity will need to be strengthened.  \n \n5.  Lack  of  Capacity  in  Trade  Policy  Making  and  Application.  Many  developing \ncountries, and least-developed countries in particular, lack an understanding of issues related to \neconomic  and  trade  policies  and  their  application,  and  the  mechanisms  governing  trade \nintegration. With the launching of the Doha development round at the end of 2001, and the \nintensifying of negotiations, requests for trade-related assistance have increased. Institutions \nwith trade-related expertise (e.g. the World Trade Organization, the United Nations Conference \non  Trade  and  Development,  and  bilateral  agencies)  have  expanded  their  capacity-building \nactivities  over  the  past  3\u20134  years,  but  demand  for  training  and  technical  support  has  far \nexceeded  supply.  Moreover,  a  drawback  of  the  training programs  and  of  related  activities \nconducted by international and/or bilateral agencies is their heavy reliance on international \nexperts, which has resulted in local institutional capacity to prepare and deliver international-\nquality training programs rarely being developed. No institution in the Asian region focusing on \nGMS is capable of providing a comprehensive and specialized training program on trade issues. \nIn conjunction with and with support from various development partners, ITD has organized and \ndelivered a number of training programs on trade and development. With support from the \nGovernment of Thailand, ITD has evolved into an institution with a vision and focus to provide \nquality training with a distinctive regional focus. It currently has 14 permanent staff, and has \nsought to establish networks for delivering training programs. ADB provided a small-scale TA to \nITD in 2003, and continued support has been requested, with the goal of assisting ITD mature \ninto a credible institution servicing the GMS region. \n                                                 \n5  In the context of trade facilitation, trade logistics includes warehousing, distribution, information management, and \nglobal supply-chain management to plan, implement, and control the efficient and cost-effective flow and storage of \nraw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods, and related information from the point of origin to the point of \nconsumption. ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The TA will promote integration within the GMS and with countries outside the region, by \nfacilitating the movement of goods and people, and by building capacity for development and \napplication  of  trade-related  policy.  Part  1  of  the  TA  aims  to  assist  the  GMS  countries  to \nimplement the SFA-TFI by delivering the following outputs: (i) national plans or road maps - \ntime-bound  and  coordinated  at  the  regional  level  through  the  TFWG;  (ii)  a  regional  work \nprogram for the TFWG for implementing the SFA-TFI; (iii) national institutional mechanisms for \ncoordinating the SFA-TFI, including strengthening of the trade facilitation focal point and core \nteams;6  and  (iv)  identification  of  capacity-building  and  training  needs,  as  well  as  targeted \ntraining  activities.  The  TA  will  explore  (i)  collaboration  and  coordination  with  international \norganizations; (ii) related initiatives under other regional cooperation programs, such as the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Ayeyawaddy-Chao Phraya-Mekong \nCooperation Strategy (ACMECS), and private sector stakeholders. \n \n7.  Part 2 of the TA will deliver the following outputs: (i) institutional strengthening of ITD; (ii) \ndevelopment of materials and training modules; (iii) training of regional trainers; (iv) support for \nthe development of networks, information systems, and information dissemination to promote \nunderstanding of economic integration issues in the GMS; and (v) enhancement of the capacity \nof ITD and GMS countries to undertake specific research. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  Through  analysis  and  targeted  training  activities,  the  TA  will  assist  GMS  countries \nimprove their capacity for trade facilitation and trade policy formation. The TA will be highly \nparticipatory, requiring full support and collaboration from TA counterparts. The outline terms of \nreference for consulting services are in Appendix 3. Key activities include the following. \n \n  1.  Part 1: Support to Implement the SFA-TFI \n \n9.  Analytical Work. For customs procedures, technical regulations and standards, the \nanalysis will (i) focus on identifying and closing gaps between key international standards and \nthe existing situation in each GMS country;7 and (ii) identify and address laws, regulations, \nprocedures, and forms that can be harmonized across the GMS. The TA will also (i) review the \nneed to construct and implement systems of standards, quality assurance, accreditation, etc. to \nenhance competitiveness; and (ii) examine the feasibility of mutual recognition and equivalence \nin  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  Agreements  on  Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary  (SPS) \nMeasures and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), based on experiences in other regions. The \nTA will also examine steps and procedures that could potentially lead to a GMS business visa, \nexamining the experiences of ASEAN, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and ACMECS. For \ntrade logistics, the TA will undertake the following activities: (i) identify behind-border logistical \nimpediments;  (ii)  assess  logistics  facilities,  including  but  not  limited  to  multimodal  facilities \n                                                 \n6  The core teams will include representatives from the (i) customs administration; (ii) standards, quarantine, and \ninspection authorities; (iii) transport, information and communication technology, and foreign affairs ministries; and \n(iv) border agencies. They will eventually constitute the SFA-TFI unit mechanism envisaged in the SFA-TFI \ndocument. \n7  Such benchmarks include the Revised Kyoto Convention, the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements on \nCustoms  Valuation,  the  ASEAN  Harmonized  Tariff  Nomenclature,  the  WTO  Agreements  on  Sanitary  and \nPhytosanitary (SPS) Measures and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), and others deemed necessary. ", "4   \nand/or interchanges, freight distribution centers and container depots, and service providers \nserving the GMS region; (iii) document supply-chain costs for intra- and inter-regional trade; (iv) \ndetermine the critical components in developing the logistics sector; and (v) identify the human \nresource development needs for the logistics sector.  \n \n10.  SFA-TFI Unit Mechanism and Identification of Training Workshops. The TA will \nassist the designated trade facilitation focal points in (i) coordinating the processes leading to \nthe formulation of national and regional plans in support of the SFA-TFI, (ii) setting up the \nmechanism for monitoring and reviewing the progress of those plans, and (iii) advising on the \nnecessary steps within GMS countries for setting up effectively functioning trade facilitation focal \npoints and core teams. This includes coordinating with the national mechanisms established \nunder the cross border transport agreement to ensure that they and SFA-TFI activities are \ncomplementary. The TA will review ongoing training and capacity-building programs in the \nGMS, and propose the most effective approach and method for delivering specialized training \non trade facilitation. The TA will organize and design two highly participatory technical training \nprograms for the trade facilitation focal points and core teams to prepare them for the required \nanalytical work, such as gap and needs assessments in the priority areas.   \n \n  2.  Part 2: Capacity Building for Trade \n \n11.  Three modules will be developed. Module 1 focuses on trade in goods, addressing tariff \nnegotiations, customs laws (customs valuation, customs classification, and rules of origin), and \ntrade facilitation aspects of trade remedies. Module 2 addresses behind border, trade, and \ninvestment issues, including negotiating techniques, and approaches to trade in services and \ninvestments liberalization. Lessons and options will be drawn from the General Agreement on \nTrade  in  Services,  the  associated  agreements,  and  the  ASEAN  framework  agreement  on \nservices. Module 3 focuses on the drafting of legislation to prepare trade agreements. This will \nbegin with a review of the WTO perspective, and critically examine the relevant agreements in \nAsia. The modules will follow a standard template to be developed under the TA, and will be \nsupplemented by a series of case studies drawn from the Asian region.  \n \n12.   Part  2  will  fund  training  programs  in  testing  and  delivering  the  training  modules \ndeveloped under the TA. ADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic Integration, the Economics and \nResearch Department, and the ADB Institute will assist with the planned training activities, as \ndeemed fitting, and whenever possible. The TA will aim to assist ITD and GMS countries in \nestablishing and expanding knowledge networks with local institutions and/or universities, and \nwith international agencies such as the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank \nInstitute, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and \nArtNet,  in  addition  to  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Regional  Economic  Integration,  the  Economics  and \nResearch Department, and the ADB Institute. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,490,000 equivalent. Part 1 of the TA estimated at \n$890,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the PRC providing \n$400,000,  and  ADB  providing  $400,000  equivalent  from  its  TA  funding  program.  The \nparticipating governments will provide the remaining $90,000 equivalent in-kind, in the form of \ncounterpart staff, logistics support (e.g. office space for consultants during their visits), local \ntransport, and sharing of training costs when feasible. Part 2 of the TA estimated to cost \n$600,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the PRC providing \n$250,000, and ADB providing $250,000 from its TA funding program. ITD will provide the ", "  5\nremaining  $100,000  equivalent  in-kind,  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  logistic  support, \nconference facilities, and training costs sharing. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  ADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia  Department  will  be \nresponsible for implementation of the TA. Trade facilitation focal points and core teams from \nGMS countries will be the main counterparts for Part 1. ITD will be the main counterpart for Part \n2. Beneficiaries of TA activities under Part 2 will mainly be participants from GMS countries.  \n \n15.  Part 1 of the TA will be implemented by an international consulting firm. The consultants \nwill be selected and engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection method, and simplified \ntechnical proposal procedures, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe  international  consultants  (input  of  15  person-months)  will  be  supported  by  national \nconsultants (total input of 20 person-months), who may be engaged from any of the GMS \ncountries. The national consultants will be engaged together with the firm. In addition, an \ninternational expert with extensive experience in institution building for trade facilitation will be \nrecruited on an individual basis for 4 person-months, to provide timely inputs to the initial phase \nof  implementation,  and  to  assist  with  overall  implementation.  Because  trade  facilitation \nconstitutes an important aspect of regional integration, a regional integration specialist may \nneed to be required at a later stage to develop regional integration road maps, should funds be \navailable.  \n \n16.  Part 2 will be implemented by a team of four international consultants (input of 10 \nperson-months) and two national consultants (input of 10 person-months), who will be recruited \nby ADB on an individual basis, as timing for selection and fielding of consultants will vary \ndepending on readiness to prepare and test modules. A pool of regional resource persons (input \nof 8 person-months) will be identified and trained as regional trainers, and will conduct selected \nresearch studies. All consultants and resource persons will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Procurement of equipment will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2006); equipment and computer software will remain with ITD upon \ncompletion of the TA. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over the duration of 18 months, and will commence in July \n2006 and be completed in January 2008. One month after mobilization, the consultant teams \nunder parts 1 and 2 will separately prepare detailed inception reports. Midterm reports will be \nsubmitted 9 months after TA commencement, and draft final reports for parts 1 and 2 will be \nsubmitted 1 month before completion of the TA. For Part 1, at least two training workshops will \nbe held to target the trade facilitation focal points and core teams, with about 30 officials trained. \nFor Part 2, a total of 10 persons from ITD and the GMS countries who can serve as trainers will \nbe trained, and four training workshops, targeting 80 GMS participants, will be held. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China; and (ii) ADB \nproviding the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis for Support to \nTrade Facilitation and Capacity Building in the Greater Mekong Subregion, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.
