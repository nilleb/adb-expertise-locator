Facing  the  growing  problem  of  a  deteriorating  environment  (air,  water,  and  land), \ninitiatives  for  regional  environmental  cooperation  in  the  South  Asian  countries  have  been \ngathering momentum. After a series of working group meetings in the environment sector under \nthe South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program, participating countries \n(Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal)  identified,  among  others,  air  quality  management \n(AQM) as an important area for subregional cooperation. This technical assistance (TA)1 will \ncomplement the Male Declaration2 and support the efforts of the SASEC countries in promoting \nAQM in the subregion by strengthening the network and sharing of data, monitoring practices, \nand AQM best practices in other countries; and by formulating an integrated AQM system and \naction plan that will enhance AQM in the SASEC countries. The TA will complement3 the \nprograms initiated under the Clean Air Initiative-Asia (CAI-Asia) and the TA for better air quality \nmanagement.4 Consultations in all four countries were carried out with key government line \nagencies, city officials, research groups, the industrial and transport sectors, nongovernmental \norganizations (NGOs), and donor agencies. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Air  pollution  is  one  of  many  human-made  environmental  disasters.  It  is  a  major \nenvironmental concern in South Asia and internationally. Heavy air pollution affects a person\u2019s \nhealth directly, and the productivity of the labor force, indirectly through ill health. In Dhaka \nalone, air-pollution related illnesses claim 15,000 lives each year. In Bhutan, acute respiratory \ntract diseases have affected from 10.1% of the total population in 1990 to over 14% of the total \npopulation in 2002. In Nepal, the cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased four \ntimes in the last 10 years and soared to more than 800 cases in 2002. In India, the air quality \nindex in 20 cities fall in the \u201cdangerous category\u201d, while in 14 cities the values are in the \u201cbad \ncategory.\u201d Other impacts of air pollution include increased health expenditure (for example, a \nrecent study on the economic costs associated with environmental degradation in India found \nthat the total health costs due to air pollution averaged $1.3 billion per annum);5 reduced quality \nof life; premature deaths; corroded building materials; and disturbed ecosystem and conditions \nof livestock and vegetation.  \n \n3.  The major causes of air pollution in SASEC countries include rapid industrialization, \nurbanization, and increased nonenvironment-friendly energy production. Regional air pollution, \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 May 2003. \n2 The Male Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution and Its Likely Transboundary Effects in South Asia \nwas adopted by Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka in 1988. The \nDeclaration calls on those countries to assess and analyze origins and causes of regional air pollution, develop and \nadopt strategies for minimizing air pollution, cooperate and set up monitoring arrangements, and build up \nstandardized methods to monitor air quality and analyze their impact without prejudice to national activities. \n3 CAI-Asia is an Asia-wide initiative, which focuses on knowledge management, capacity building, regional policies \nand standards, formulation of city-based air quality management strategies, and pilot projects. The TA, through its \nactivities will make an important contribution to the activities of CAI-Asia in the South Asian region. \n4 Proposed TA for better air quality management in Asia. \n5 Brandon, C., K. Hommann, and N.M. Kishor 1995. The Cost of Inaction: Valuing the Economy-wide Cost of \nEnvironmental Degradation in India.

", "2   \nespecially from emissions of sulfur and nitrogen compounds, is increasingly a problem as \nindustrialization speeds up in the subregion. The impacts of these emissions are felt locally, \nnationally, and regionally. Acid deposition is not just a national concern; it is also a regional \nenvironmental problem that transcends national boundaries. Although reports of acid deposition \nin  the  region  have  been  few,  the  damage  from  acid  deposition  has  been  detrimental  to \nbiodiversity. Therefore, there is a need for an effective ambient air quality surveillance program, \nwhich would serve as an early warning system to identify the trend of air pollutants and monitor \ntransboundary air pollutants. However, management of these air pollution problems poses huge \nfinancial, technical, and logistical constraints for urban and national authorities. Furthermore, \ncurrent trends in urbanization do not suggest any rapid abatement in the problem posed.6  \n \n4.  Systematic  air  quality  monitoring  is  a  relatively  new  initiative  in  Bangladesh.  The \nDepartment of Environment in Bangladesh started collecting data on ambient air quality in 1992 \nin  four  divisional  towns  (Bogra,  Chittagong,  Dhaka,  and  Khulna).  At  present,  there  is  no \nmonitoring program for assessing air quality in Bhutan. Some monitoring of air quality is being \nconducted in Kathmandu, Nepal. India is the only country with a large number of air quality \nmonitoring stations in urban and industrial areas. The National Environmental Engineering \nResearch Institute in India monitors ambient air quality in 30 stations covering 10 major cities. \nCurrently there is no monitoring network to monitor transboundary movement of air pollutants \nand their effects in the subregion. Other common weaknesses hindering effective air quality \nmanagement in the SASEC subregion are described in paras. 5-9. \n \n5.  Weak Institutional Capacity and Lack of Data. Air quality monitoring is becoming an \nincreasingly important issue in the SASEC countries. As a result, some governments in the \nsubregion have proposed new air quality initiatives. However, there is a considerable shortfall in \nnational and local governments\u2019 capacity to implement an effective pollution control plan, as \ncritical data\u2014such as long-term quality-controlled air-quality monitoring for basic pollutants, an \ninventory of emission sources, appropriate dispersion modeling, and exposure to information\u2014\nare insufficient.  \n \n6.  Lack of Coordination. The responsibility for AQM is divided between a number of \ngovernment ministries and local administrations thus complicating policy making, systematic air \nquality monitoring, and enforcement of air quality standards. Lack of coordination has impeded \nthe development of a strategic framework for air quality management systems that will cover all \ncenters of air pollution.   \n \n7.  Poor  Information  Exchange.  At  the  national  level,  there  is  a  large  amount  of \ninformation on air quality and AQM initiatives in SASEC countries, but the information is often \nnot  readily  available.  As  a  consequence,  there  is  duplication  in  collection  and  available \ninformation is not always consulted before to decision making.  \n \n8.   Poor information exchange on best practices in AQM and lack of harmonized air \npollution policies in the region have contributed to the absence of regional cooperation in \naddressing air quality. Although several attempts have been made at regional cooperation to \naddress air pollution in South Asia much work needs to be done to deal with the issue of air \nquality management in the SASEC countries. Countries will best improve their AQM by working \ntogether and exchanging experiences on common practices. Strong coordinative approaches \n                                                 \n6 Haq G., W-J. Han, C. Kim, H.

", "    3 \nwill  be  required  for  effective  dissemination  of  information  on  air  quality  issues,  collective \nlearning, and the formulation of comprehensive AQM strategies. \n \n9.  Toward a Regional Approach to Air Quality Management. Previous internationally \nfunded initiatives have focused on raising awareness, but they have been localized with limited \nsharing  of  information  among  cities,  stakeholders,  and  across  borders.  Air  pollution \nmanagement is a relatively new effort for the SASEC countries. The World Bank is supporting \nthe implementation of a learning and innovation loan to Bangladesh to address AQM issues \nrelated to vehicular emissions. The first really comprehensive program is CAI-Asia, which \nprovides support to (i) sharing of knowledge and experiences on AQM, (ii) improve policy and \nregulatory frameworks at the regional level and pilot projects and (iii) encourage innovation.7 A \ngreater  degree  of  sharing  successes  and  failures  in  a  full  range  of  air  pollution  control \nmanagement initiatives should continue and be more rigorously promoted. The TA will closely \ncoordinate with CAI-Asia to set up a subregional network for collecting more comprehensive \nand up-to-date documentation on air quality in the SASEC countries to inform the consultation \nprocess, and create stakeholder awareness of the sources and impacts as well as solutions. \nThe TA will build on ongoing programs, such as the local city initiatives; and initiatives of United-\nStates Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA), the World Bank, and bilateral agencies, to \ndevelop a subregional action plan to address urban air quality problems in the subregion. Strong \ncooperative  linkages  between  SASEC  countries  will  be  promoted  and  will  be  taken  into \nconsideration in conceptualizing of the strategic AQM plans. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will provide continued support to the AQM ongoing initiatives in the SASEC \ncountries and establish a well coordinated information sharing and cooperation network. By \nbuilding stakeholder awareness and capacity, the TA aims to emphasize the priority given to air \npollution, and enhance the expertise and capabilities to formulate AQM policies and strategic \nframeworks in their respective countries, thereby improving the health and well-being of urban \npopulations.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will undertake the following key activities. \n \n1.  Establish local air quality networks  \n \n12.  This activity will entail the setting up of a unit in the Implementing Agency8, which will \nhave as its main task, to collect and organize the wealth of information on air quality and AQM \nin each of the four countries. In addition, it will involve setting up and maintaining a detailed \noverview of all ongoing and planned AQM-related activities. The collected information will be \ndocumented and stored on the web-site of CAI-Asia.  The Ministry of Environment in each \nSASEC country will nominate its implementing agency.  \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for the Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities. Manila (RETA 6016). \n8 It is recommended that the implementing agency be an academic or research institution. ", "4   \n13.  The nominated Implementing Agency will develop the SASEC component of the CAI-\nAsia network. The network\u2019s functions will include, but will not be limited to (i) promoting \nexchange of collected information on air quality and AQM in the respective countries; (ii) \npromoting the discussion on a medium-term agenda for AQM in the each of the countries; (iii) \ncontributing to the discussion on the development of a comprehensive, integrated AQM system, \nin each country, which has the capacity to address AQM in all places where required; (iv) acting \nas a forum for discussion on best approaches for managing stationary, indoor, and mobile \nsources of pollution; and (v) identifying capacity building needs of the AQM sector in the South \nAsian Subregional Economic Cooperation countries and identifying strategies to overcome \nshortcomings. \n \n2.  Develop  an  appropriate  integrated  air  quality  management  system  for \nSASEC countries \n \n14.  The SASEC countries have over the years adopted air quality standards and emission \nstandards and have also made a substantive start with monitoring air quality as well as adopting \nselected control strategies in a number of cities. A study will be carried out to analyze the \ncurrent strengths and weaknesses of the AQM systems in the four countries. The study will also \nanalyze AQM systems adopted in the United States, Europe, and  other parts of Asia, to \ndetermine their suitability for each of the four countries. The results and recommendations will \nbe validated with stakeholders from the SASEC countries.  \n \n3.  Upgrade the capacity of key technical staff responsible for air quality \nanalysis in SASEC countries \n \n15.  Staff responsible for air quality monitoring at central level in the SASEC countries will be \ntrained to upgrade their technical capacity. Areas that covered under the training program will \nbe  analysis  and  development  of  emission  inventories,  dispersion  models,  and  source \napportionment. Exchange of information on best practices in AQM will be critical.  \n \n4.  Formulate action plans for selected cities in SASEC countries \n \n16.  Action plans, based on the results of air quality monitoring have been formulated for a \nnumber of cities in India and to some extent in Bangladesh. The action plans were developed \nlargely on an ad hoc basis. The TA will support the development of a low-cost approach to the \ndevelopment of action plans that can be easily replicated across all four countries.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The cost estimates \nprovide for consulting services, international travel, administrative costs, and workshop and \ntraining expenses. A summary of the cost estimates is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, starting in February 2004  and will be \ncompleted in January 2005. The TA will be executed by ADB and will be supervised by the \nSouth  Asia  Regional  Department  in  close  cooperation  with  the  Regional  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department. ADB will coordinate closely with the SASEC countries and CAI-Asia \nin implementing the TA. In the SASEC countries, the ministries of environment will be the ", "    5 \nnational  focal  points  and  will  be  responsible  for  policy-related  matters  relating  to  the \nimplementation of the TA. The focal points will also nominate their respective implementing \nagencies. Coordination at the subregional level will be through the SASEC Working Group on \nEnvironment. \n \n19.  The TA will require about 3 person-months of international consulting services to assist \nwith training. A total of 68 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required to \nassist in establishing the local networks and to support the formulation of the integrated AQM \nsystems and the local action plans. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants as individuals.
