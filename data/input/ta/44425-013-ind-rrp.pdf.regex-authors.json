THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nadditional financing  loan  to  India  for the  Bihar  State  Highways  II  Project. The report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for preparing the Road Master Plan for Bihar\u2019s \nState Highway Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The additional financing will expand the original project by rehabilitating and upgrading \n254 kilometers (km) of state highways in Bihar identified under the Bihar State Highways \nDevelopment Program, 2007\u20132012. These severely deteriorated highway sections are in the \nvery poor northern and southern parts of the state. The project will upgrade existing roads to \ntwo lanes, strengthen existing pavement, strengthen culverts and bridges, and construct new \nbridges and cross-draining structures. Consulting services will be provided to supervise the \nimplementation of civil works. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Bihar is one of the poorest and most economically backward states in India, with income \nper capita at less than 30% of the national average and 43% of the population living below the \npoverty line, well above the 35% national average. The state\u2019s population grew by 25% from \n2001 to 2011. Nearly 58% of Biharis are below the age of 25, ranking highest in India. Bihar\u2019s \nstate highway network has 3,989 km of roads.2 Road density in Bihar is only 901 km per million \npeople, as compared to the national average of 2,567 km. The road network in Bihar is very \npoor  in  terms  of  coverage  and  condition,  while  demand  for  road  transport  continuously \nincreases, as evidenced by the large increase in the state\u2019s population. The Government of \nBihar has scaled up investment in road development since 2007 to provide statewide access by \nsuccessfully rehabilitating 2,470 km of state highway with Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nassistance and state resources. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Bihar State Highways Project was approved in September 2008 for $420 million.3 \nThe  first  project  financed  the  rehabilitation  of  820 km  of  state  highways  and  successfully \nimplemented significant sector reforms, including the establishment of the Bihar State Road \nDevelopment Corporation (BSRDC) and its adoption of international best practices for road \nplanning and maintenance systems, financial management, and public procurement. The first \nproject was performing well and closed in July 2012, as scheduled.  \n \n5.  The Bihar State Highways II Project, approved in September 2010 for $300 million, \nfinances the rehabilitation of 356 km of state highways and is expected to be completed in \n2015.4  Further, procurement for another 33 km of state highway is being carried out to utilize \nthe loan surplus. Support toward adopting best practices for public\u2013private partnership (PPP), \nroad safety, and road asset management have been successfully implemented.5  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Expanded from 3,127 km in 2010 by upgrading major district roads. \n3  ADB. 2008.

To further expand development impact, the Government of India has requested a third \nloan to finance the rehabilitation of 254 km of roads in Bihar. The proposed roads for additional \nfinancing were selected in line with the Bihar State Highways Development Program, which \naims to upgrade all state highways to two lanes, satisfying basic needs of rural connectivity with \nopen access to all road users. The roads will be reconstructed taking road safety and flood risk \ninto consideration. A survey carried out regarding the roads under the first project revealed that \nroad improvement has benefited local communities including women through improved access \nto markets, education, health care, and other social services.6 Similar benefits are expected \nfrom the proposed additional financing. \n \n7.  The original project is performing well.7 Implementation progress has been satisfactory \nwith the awarding of all four civil works contracts, two supervision consultant contracts, and \ncapacity development TA consultant contracts, and with $40 million disbursed. The project is on \ntrack for completion by 2015, has experienced no construction cost overrun so far, and complies \nsatisfactorily  with safeguard policy requirements. \n \n8.  Additional  financing  will  scale  up  the  original  project  by  expanding  the  highway \nupgrading component. It will help achieve the full extent of improvements envisaged under the \nproject by covering additional geographic areas in northern and southern Bihar, increasing the \nnumber of project beneficiaries in poor villages, and optimizing access to the state highway \nnetwork. It will support the state government\u2019s priority of implementing improvements quickly to \nensure that the development impact of the state highway network is optimized and its benefits \nare reaped in a timely way. All necessary due diligence has been conducted. The project meets \nADB\u2019s eligibility criteria for additional financing as it (i) remains technically feasible, economically \nviable, and financially sound; (ii) is accorded high priority by the government; (iii) is consistent \nwith  the  project\u2019s  development  objectives;  and  (iv)  is  consistent  with  the  current  country \npartnership strategy.  \n \n9.  In keeping with the original project, the targeted outcome of the additional financing is \nconsistent with the strategic objectives set out in ADB's country partnership strategy, 2009\u2013\n2012: (i) improve the transport system in India with a focus on poorer states, (ii) make growth \nmore inclusive, and (iii) quicken the pace of poverty reduction and social development. 8  The \nadditional financing is included in the India country operations business plan, 2011\u20132013.9  \n \n10.  The  project  will  add  value  through  four  aspects.  First,  the  project  will  address  the \nchallenges of climate change\u2014specifically the risk of flooding and increased carbon emissions \ncaused  by  additional  traffic  generated  by  road  improvement\u2014through  (i)  more  stringent \nengineering design and green landscaping; (ii) planting 10 trees for every tree removed, more \nthan triple the 1:3 statutory requirement, and implementing the compensatory plantation of trees \nwith strong community participation, including women, to achieve higher rates of plant survival \nand to promote ownership; and (iii) using solar panels at construction sites to sequester carbon \nand reduce carbon emissions. Second, the project will address road safety through community \nparticipation by incorporating a training-of-trainers model in which men and women from project \nareas receive training from road safety experts and provide training in turn to project-affected \n                                                \n6  ADB. Forthcoming. Impact of Transport Project on Women. Manila. \n7  The original project was flagged as potential problem in Q3\u2013Q4 2011 due to low disbursement in US dollars \ncaused by the 22.5% depreciation of the Indian rupee, though all contracts were awarded ahead of schedule. The \nprojection was revised taking into account currency depreciation and actual bid prices. In Q1\u2013Q2 2012, the original \nproject was back on track and performing well. \n8  ADB. 2010.

Third, the project will promote gender mainstreaming by actively involving \nwomen  in  community-based  initiatives,  livelihood  restoration  activities,  and  awareness \nprograms. Lastly, the project will prepare a 20-year strategic master plan for developing Bihar\u2019s \nstate highways, including long-term vision and goals, an action program, and a monitoring and \nevaluation system with performance indicators and targets. The master plan will be supported \nby a financing plan for the action program, which will identify potential funding sources from the \nstate government, PPP, and development partners. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be a more efficient state road transport system supporting sustainable \neconomic growth in Bihar. The outcome will be improved transport efficiency and safety on \nproject roads. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The outputs will be (i) building and upgrading 254 km of state highways (Table 1), \n(ii) improved institutional capacity for sustainable transport sector development, and (iii) better \nroad safety and greater awareness of potential social issues. The revised performance indicator \nof the highway upgrading component is 643 km, comprising the original project\u2019s 389 km and \nthe 254 km under the additional financing. The project will provide consulting services to support \nthe implementation and monitoring of the civil works. \n \nTable 1: Project Roads for Additional Financing \nState Highway  Project Road  Length (kilometers) \n83  Bagi\u2013Barbigha  37 \n86  Saraiya\u2013Motipur  28 \n87  Runnisaidpur\u2013Bhiswa  65 \n88  Baruna Pul (NH 103)\u2013Rasiyari  124 \nTotal  254 \nSource: Bihar State Road Development Corporation Ltd.   \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $799 million with additional financing (Table 2). The \ngovernment has requested a loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources for the \nadditional financing to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, straight line repayment method, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,10 a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n                                                \n10 The interest includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points.

As the Bihar State Highways Development Program will end in 2012, policy and advisory \nTA in the amount of $1 million equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The TA will support the state government\u2019s \nsector development initiatives, especially for preparing of a 20-year strategic master plan for \ndeveloping Bihar\u2019s state highways, including long-term vision and goals, an action program, a \nfinancing plan, and a monitoring and evaluation system with performance indicators and targets.  \n \n17.  The TA will require 61 person-months of consulting services, 33 international and 28 \nnational experts. ADB will engage a consulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be asked to submit full \ntechnical proposals, and quality- and cost-based selection will be used with a quality\u2013cost ratio \nof 80:20. The terms of reference for the TA are set out in the project administration manual.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n18.  Engineering. The engineering design was developed based on site conditions, surveys, \nand  field  investigations,  optimizing  the  required  improvement  works  for  economy  and \nconstruction  efficiency  in  accordance  with  Indian  standards,12 which  align  with  applicable \n                                                \n12 The design standard is based on Ministry of Road Transport and Highways: Specifications for Road and Bridge \nWorks (4th Revision), published by Indian Roads Congress, 2001. \n ", "6 \ninternational design standards. The design was prepared to minimize land acquisition and social \nand  environmental  impacts.  A  road  safety  audit  produced  recommendations  that  were \nincorporated in the design of the project.13  \n \n19.  Operation and maintenance. The state government has increased the maintenance \nbudget from $48 million in 2006 to $79 million in 2011, an increase of 65% in 5 years that now \nsubstantially meets the maintenance requirements. The budget achieved 100% utilization in \n2009\u20132010, compared with 90% or less in previous years, indicating that overall use efficiency \nhas improved. A road maintenance policy, which includes an operate\u2013maintain\u2013transfer scheme \nwith private sector participation, has been formulated and is awaiting cabinet approval. This will \nalso contribute to funding maintenance for the rest of the state highways.  \n \nB.  Economic \n20.  An  economic  analysis  has  been  undertaken  for  each  of  the  four  project  roads  by \ncomparing options with the project and without it. The Highway Development and Management \nModel 4 was used to assess the project's economic viability. Benefits considered in the analysis \ninclude time and vehicle operating cost savings enabled by the project. Economic analysis \nfound the project economically viable with an overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of \n19.5%. Individual road sections included in the project have EIRRs ranging from 14.1% to \n23.1%. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of economic viability, as reducing benefits \nby 10% and increasing costs by 10% leave the EIRR at 16.6%. The project is justified in social \ncost\u2013benefit terms.14  \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  Institutional  and  financial  management  capacity.  The  BSRDC  has  satisfactory \ncapacity  for  project  financial  accounting  and  sufficient  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  disbursement \nprocedures.15 It will maintain separate records and accounts to identify goods and services \nfinanced from loan proceeds, expenditures incurred, and the use of local funds under project \ncomponents. The BSRDC has a well-established PPP cell with nine full-time staff. ADB TA to \nprovide hands-on training to the BSRDC on PPP is ongoing (footnote 5). Currently, the BSRDC \nhas three PPP projects under implementation and four under processing. \n \n22.  Procurement. Goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The civil works contracts will be undertaken in \nfour contract packages, which are estimated at more than $29 million and will be procured \nthrough international competitive bidding, using ADB standard bidding documents for large civil \nworks contracts with post-qualification under the single-stage, two-envelope system. Consulting \nservices will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, \nas amended from time to time). The BSRDC will select two international consulting firms to \nsupervise the construction of civil works under the project using ADB procedures for quality- and \ncost-based selection, full technical proposals, and a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. One consulting \nfirm will be engaged for the Muzaffarpur region and the other for the Samastipur region. The \nterms of reference for consulting services and a procurement plan indicating thresholds and \nreview procedures, goods, works, and consulting services are in the project administration \nmanual. \n                                                \n13 A budget of about $6.1 million has been added to the civil works cost to implement road safety features. \n14 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Since its creation on 17 February 2009, under Resolution Sec 8/Misc/05-117/2006-1014 (s)we, the BSRDC has \ntaken over project implementation from the Road Construction Department. \n ", "7 \n23.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  India,  Government  of  Bihar,  and  BSRDC.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  Poverty reduction and social impact. A poverty and social assessment survey of 604 \nhouseholds was conducted, and 40 focus group discussions were held in 53 villages in project-\ninfluenced  areas.  Most  respondents  stated  that  the  project  will  provide  communities  with \nenhanced access and mobility. In the short term, the project will generate an estimated 412,200 \nperson-days  of  employment.  Improved  links  to  markets  and  production  centers  will  create \nadditional  economic  and  employment  opportunities.  Improved  connectivity  will  help  rural \nresidents transport their products more quickly and obtain higher profit margins, as they will no \nlonger depend solely on local markets and middlemen. An estimated 4,524,182 people will \nexperience the economic benefits brought about by the project.16  \n \n25.  Gender and development. Most women in the project area are homemakers, as rural \nwomen  rarely  work  outside  the  home  unless  they  are  very  poor.  During  in-depth  gender \nassessment of the four roads\u2014interviewing 381 women and holding 31 women-specific focus \ngroup  discussions\u2014women  indicated  that  improved  road  conditions  would  provide  better \naccess to health-care services, higher levels of education, economic opportunities, and social \ninteraction. Shorter travel times will leave more time for productive activities, health care, and \nself-development.   \n \n26.  A gender action plan has been prepared to (i) promote women\u2019s participation in project \nplanning,  design,  and  implementation;  (ii)  maximize  women\u2019s  access  to  project  benefits; \n(iii) provide  opportunities  to  increase  women\u2019s  skills,  income,  and  participation  in  decision-\nmaking;  and  (iv)  minimize  social  vulnerability.  Findings  from  meaningful  consultations  with \nwomen  guided  the  incorporation  of  practical  and  implementable  gender  mainstreaming \nactivities,  including  (i)  involving  women  in  community-based  afforestation  programs;  (ii) \nemploying women in construction; and (iii) ensuring the sustainability of road safety awareness \nefforts in roadside communities by having road safety specialists train women in project-affected \nareas, who will provide training in turn to their communities. In addition, BSRDC staff will \nundergo training to improve gender-sensitive designs and measures in future road projects.   \n \n27.  Provisions in the bidding documents for the civil works contractors (i) ensure that all \napplicable labor laws are complied with, including the prohibition against employ children in \nconstruction; (ii) encourage the employment of the poor, particularly women; and (iii) ensure that \nwages for men and women are equal for work of equal value. To ensure that all gender issues \nare  addressed,  a  gender  specialist  will  be  engaged  under  the  construction  supervision \nconsultant to implement the gender action plan. A gender focal officer in the BSRDC will ensure \nthe implementation of the gender action plan.17 \n \n28.  HIV/AIDS.  As  per  statistics  from  India's  National  AIDS  Control  Organization  for \nDecember 2010, the rate of new cases of HIV has been reduced by 50% since 2000. Bihar is \n                                                \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n17 The BSRDC currently operates its own corporate social responsibility program to showcase the organization\u2019s \ncontinuous commitment to behaving ethically, contributing to economic development, and improving the quality of \nlife of the community, focusing on women and girls. Program activities include sponsoring 11 orphan girls\u2019 \neducation and constructing a hostel for 120 underprivileged girls. The corporate social responsibility budget for \nFY2011 is approximately $2.2 million, and the gender focal officer implements and monitors the program.  \n ", "8 \ncategorized as a low-prevalence state with an estimated HIV incidence of 0.2% of the 2009 \npopulation. State, district, and block campaigns are undertaken by the health department and \nthe Bihar AIDS Control Society to raise awareness. Based on public consultations, the project \nhas incorporated measures to mitigate HIV/AIDS risks by having nongovernment organizations \nundertake semiannual awareness programs at construction sites and project-influenced areas, \nin particular at important village locations and in schools and block offices. Awareness-raising is \nconducted separately for men and women to address gender-specific issues.  \n \n29.  To combat risks of human trafficking, the Government of Bihar launched in 2007 a \nprogram  to  prevent  the  trafficking  of  women  and  children  and  to  ensure  comprehensive \nrehabilitation  for  victims.  In  addition,  Action  against  Trafficking  and  Sexual  Exploitation  of \nChildren,  an  international  nongovernment  organization,  implements  awareness-building  and \nprevention programs in the state.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Land acquisition and resettlement. The project is categorized as Category A for land \nacquisition and resettlement. The project was developed with a commitment to minimize land \nacquisition through appropriate technical design. Road widening will occur mostly within existing \nrights-of-way, and bypasses are used in congested areas. A 100% census was conducted \nbased on detailed design. Four resettlement plans were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and the policies and regulations of the governments of India \nand Bihar.  \n \n31.  Project land acquisition will affect 118 hectares consisting of 6,516 land plots and 3,937 \nstructures: 3,674 private, 7 community, 131 religious, and 125 government. Of the 3,674 private \nstructures, 3,106 belong to titleholders and 568 to non-titleholders. Of the 9,523 displaced \nhouseholds, 2,660 are physically displaced and 6,863 economically displaced. The entitlement \nmatrix provides for specific compensation and resettlement assistance for the types of losses \ncaused by the project. Compensation for lost assets will be paid on the basis of replacement \ncost. Resettlement assistance for lost income and livelihoods will be provided to titleholders and \nnon-titleholders  alike,  with  special  measures  available  to  vulnerable  displaced  households. \nResettlement plans have been approved and disclosed on the ADB and BSRDC websites. The \nexisting Environment, Social Development, and Resettlement Cell of the BSRDC, which was \ninstrumental in the effective implementation of the resettlement plans for ongoing loans, will also \nimplement this project. The total cost of resettlement is estimated at $33 million. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as Category C for indigenous people. \nSeventeen households belonging to scheduled tribes are present in the project-affected area \nalong State Highway 83. During project preparation, consultation with all 17 households found \nthat they did not have collective attachment to the project area or live together in distinctive \ncommunities. The study did not show any difference in impact between indigenous groups and \nothers. The social impact assessment confirmed that the socioeconomic impact of the project \nwill not differ for tribal groups and the larger population. Special provisions have been made in \nthe resettlement plans to address impacts on indigenous people. If any significant impacts on \nindigenous people are identified, an indigenous peoples plan will be prepared and submitted to \nADB for approval. \n \n33.  Environment.  The  project  is  categorized  as  Category  B  for  environment.  Initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) were prepared for the four roads. The findings of the IEEs \nindicate that the project is unlikely to cause any significant adverse environmental impacts, as \n ", "9 \nall four roads already existed and no forest area, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, critical \nhabitats, or similar eco-sensitive areas are traversed. Most of the impacts are likely to be during \nconstruction and associated with earthmoving, ground shaping, heavy equipment operation, and \ntravel over unpaved roads. These impacts are temporary, and mitigation is readily designed and \neasily implemented. The environmental management plan will be implemented mainly by the \ncontractors during construction and by the BSRDC during operation. The existing Environment, \nSocial Development and Resettlement Cell will monitor implementation. All IEEs have been \ndisclosed in compliance to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n34.  Addressing the challenges of climate change. Portions of state highways in northern \nBihar  are  susceptible  to  floodwaters  originating  in  the  Himalayas.18 Northern  Bihar  has \nexperienced  worsening  flooding  since  the  1980s,  highlighting  the  need  for  more  stringent \ncountermeasures to ensure project objectives are sustained. The BRSDC has adopted in road \nimprovement design the following key features: (i) upgraded road surfaces constructed at least \n1 meter higher than the high flood level with 50-year return period, (ii) stratified and multistory \nroadside plantation where timber wood and similar erosion-stopping varieties are planted on the \nright-of-way periphery to break flood flow velocity and protect the road embankment, (iii) the \ninstallation of larger cross-drainage, (iv) the construction of new side drains particularly in built-\nup areas, and (v) stone pitching and bioengineering along strategic areas where breaches and \ninundation have previously occurred.  \n \n35.  Greenhouse gas emission mitigation and monitoring. To partly offset greenhouse \ngas emissions from increased traffic arising from road upgrading, the BSRDC has committed to \nimplementing 1:10 compensatory plantation19 for all trees, regardless of ownership, following \nthe  Tirhut 20  Social  Forest  Model.  This  model  has  strong  community  participation  and \nperformance-based agreements to ensure that at least 80% of the trees survive. The BSRDC \nwill  monitor,  in  coordination  with  the  State  Pollution  Control  Board  and  the  Transport \nDepartment, roadside tailpipe emissions and ambient air quality to keep track of greenhouse \ngas emissions and air quality. Finally, to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, all contractors will be \nencouraged to install solar panels to power all lighting at campsites, with appropriate provision \nmade in the bidding documents. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5, and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.  \n \n                                                \n18 According to the Flood Management Information Unit of the Bihar Water Resources Department, the Kosi, Gandak, \nBurhi Bagmati, Kamla Balan, Mahananda, and Adhwara rivers originate in Nepal, have high discharge and \nsediment load, and ultimately empty into the plains of Bihar. About 65% of the combined catchment area of these \nrivers is in Nepal and Xizang (also known as the Tibet Autonomous Region) and only 35% in Bihar. \n19 This is higher than the 1:3 mandatory compensatory afforestation required by the Bihar Forest Department for trees \nfelled inside forestland.  \n20 Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guaranteed Program. \n ", "10 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInitial delays in  Detailed design for the roads was prepared. Advance actions for procurement and \nproject  ADB support ensure high project readiness, with the recruitment of supervision \nimplementation  consultants  and  procurement  of  civil  works  already  begun.  Environmental \n  clearance has been obtained, as well as forest clearance for three roads, with \nforest clearance for the remaining road in the final stage. Land acquisition is in \nprogress, and resettlement and rehabilitation nongovernment organizations have \nbeen mobilized. BSRDC officers have been trained on safeguard and procurement \nrequirements to mitigate the potential risk of initial delays caused by procedural \nclearance. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BSRDC = Bihar State Roads Development Corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n37.  The Government of India, the Government of Bihar, and the BSRDC have assured ADB \nthat implementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n38.  The Government of India, the Government of Bihar, and the BSRDC have agreed with \nADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project \nagreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000 to India as additional financing for the Bihar State Highways II Project, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n28 August 2012 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Performance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Design Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \n(Original Project)  (Overall Project)  (Original Project)  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project) \nImpact          Assumption \nA more efficient  Unchanged  Average daily usage of  Average daily 3,115,000  Post-implementation  Government development \nstate road  1,826,800 vehicle-km is  vehicle-km in the first full year  measurement and traffic  activities are effectively \ntransport system  achieved in the first full year  of operation (2009 baseline:  survey by the BSRDC  coordinated with road \nsupporting  of operation (2009 baseline:  between 1,253 vehicles per    sector investment, and \nsustainable  between 1,858 vehicles per  day on State Highway 83 and    the current economic \neconomic growth  day on State Highway 81  4,276 vehicles per day on    growth rate is maintained. \nin Bihar  and 4,276 vehicles per day  State Highway 91)   \nRisk \non State Highway 91).     \n      Small roadside \nPer capita GDP in project  Per capita GDP in the project  Government of Bihar  businesses lose business \ndistricts increases to 28% of  districts increases to 30% of  economic survey  opportunities because of \nIndia\u2019s per capita GDP by  India\u2019s per capita GDP by    improved efficiency and \n2020 (2007 baseline: 23%).  2020 (2007 baseline: 23%)  vehicles\u2019 higher speed of \ntravel. \nOutcome      By 2017:    Assumptions \nImproved transport  Unchanged  Vehicle travel time on  Unchanged  Post-implementation  The state-allocated \nefficiency and  project roads is reduced  measurement and traffic  maintenance budget \nsafety on project  because of their improved  survey by the BSRDC  remains sufficient for the \nroads  condition; travel speed    maintenance of the entire \nincreases to an average of    rehabilitated road \n40 km/hour for cars upon    network. \nproject completion (2009   \nStrengthened \nbaseline: 15\u201325 km/hour).   \nmanagement and \n   \nmonitoring capacity \nRoad signage meets the  Unchanged  Post-implementation \nenables the full utilization \nrequirements of the road    survey by the BSRDC \nof funds allocated for \nsafety audit upon project   \nmaintenance works.  \ncompletion (2009 baseline: \nroad signage is basic).   \n \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Performance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Design Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \n(Original Project)  (Overall Project)  (Original Project)  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project) \nOutputs           \n1.
