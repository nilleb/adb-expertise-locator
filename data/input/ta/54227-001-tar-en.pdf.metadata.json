INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the capacity \nof  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  to  prevent  disease  transmission  through \nenhanced  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  (WASH)  practices  and  an  associated  enabling \nenvironment.  The  interventions  will  directly  address  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic by (i) improving WASH practices through behavioral change campaigns in households, \ncommunities, schools, markets, health care facilities, transport hubs, and other public areas; and \n(ii) strengthening the capacity of WASH service providers and other stakeholders so that WASH \nimprovements are sustained.1 The improvements in WASH practices will have co-benefits, \nincluding building the resilience of Pacific communities to other transmissible and waterborne \ndiseases that continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the region, such as diarrhea, \ndysentery, and typhoid. It will also contribute to safely reopening of borders and restoring local \neconomies as the recovery from COVID-19 commences. \n \n2.  The TA forms part of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Comprehensive Response to \nthe COVID-19 Pandemic in the Pacific,2 though it is not included in ADB\u2019s current Pacific Regional \nOperations Business Plan, 2020\u20132022.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The COVID-19 pandemic has become a major global crisis that requires country, regional, \nand global intervention, as well as collaboration, to mitigate damage to economies and people\u2019s \nhealth. Many countries, including Pacific island countries, have imposed lockdown and border \nrestrictions to prevent the rapid spread of the disease. While border closures and quarantine \nmeasures are targeted at preventing the entry of COVID-19 into the country, safe WASH practices \nwill play a critical role in blocking transmission pathways once borders start to reopen. United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued \nguidance on the role of WASH in preventing and responding to COVID-19, highlighting the \nimportance of hand hygiene and disinfection procedures in preventing infection.4 \n \n4.  Water, sanitation, and hygiene and health in ADB\u2019s Pacific developing member \ncountries. ADB\u2019s Pacific DMCs have a poor WASH record. In terms of hand hygiene, only 25% \nof Vanuatu\u2019s population and 36% of Solomon Islands\u2019 population have on-site handwashing \nfacilities with soap and water. Only two Pacific DMCs (Niue and Samoa) have more than 50% of \ntheir population using a safely-managed drinking water service, and no Pacific DMC has more \nthan 50% of the population using a safely-managed sanitation service.5 Poor access to WASH \ncauses diarrhea, dysentery, and intestinal worm infections, which contributes to malnutrition, \nanemia, and stunting. Other WASH-related diseases prevalent in the region include skin, ear, and \neye infections, as well as vector-borne diseases such as dengue. Women, children, the elderly, \nand  the  most  disadvantaged  households  bear  a  disproportionate  share  of  the  burden  of \ninadequate WASH service provision. Poor access to services\u2014combined with high levels of \nnoncommunicable diseases, densely populated urban environments, weak health systems, and \n \n1  WASH services usually include water supply, sanitation, and handling solid waste, which help maintain hygiene. \nWASH service providers include public water and sanitation and solid waste service utilities. \n2  ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2019. Pacific Regional Operations Business Plan, 2020\u20132022. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 July 2020. \n4  WHO. 2020. Water, Sanitation, Hygiene, and Waste Management for the COVID-19 Virus. Interim Guidance. \n23 April. \n5  WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (accessed 22 April 2020).  \n ", "2 \npoor waste management\u2014magnify the high risk that COVID-19 could spread quickly and have \ndire consequences if it presents in Pacific communities. \n \n5.  Water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  services  and  campaigns.  Although  water  utilities \noperate in the key urban centers across all Pacific DMCs, water and sanitation coverage remains \nlimited and service quality is often low. Many peri-urban and rural areas rely on non-piped water \nsupplies and on-site sanitation to manage their WASH service needs. Funding allocations for \nWASH  from  central  governments  across  the  region  have  generally  been  inadequate,  as \nevidenced by continuing gaps in the delivery of infrastructure and services. Even where water \nsupplies  are  available,  handwashing  with  soap  and  water  is  not  universally  practiced, \ndemonstrating the need for behavioral change advocacy in addition to improving access to water \nsupplies. WASH awareness campaigns have been carried out to some extent in many Pacific \nDMCs, often coordinated by WASH-related clusters comprised of civil society organizations, \nwomen\u2019s groups, religious groups, government agencies, and others. However, many WASH \nprograms in the region are linked to periodic and short-term development partner financing, and \nactivities are not always sustained.  \n  \n6.  Development coordination. Several development partners are active in WASH in the \nPacific. Water and sanitation infrastructure projects have been funded by agencies including the \nWorld Bank, the European Union, the European Investment Bank, the Green Climate Fund, the \nGlobal Environment Facility, the United Nations Development Programme, the Government of \nAustralia, and the Government of New Zealand. ADB and other development partner investments \nhave traditionally focused on centralized schemes (e.g., water and wastewater treatment plants \nand  networks),  although  they  have  also  supported  some  investments  in  decentralized \ninfrastructure (e.g., rainwater harvesting and on-site sanitation). Interventions have also typically \nfocused on either planned urban or rural contexts, overlooking the provision of services to growing \npopulations in urban informal settlements. In terms of soft investments, WASH and behavioral \nchange campaigns are increasingly being built into ADB (and ADB-cofinanced) projects, in \nrecognition of the role that WASH behaviors play in meeting overall health outcomes. Several \ndevelopment partners are reviewing and adapting interventions to the evolving needs of Pacific \nisland countries in the context of COVID-19. UNICEF is partnering with the governments of Pacific \nDMCs and civil society organizations to improve WASH behaviors, while the United Nations has \nactivated  the  Pacific  Humanitarian  Team,  a  regional  coordination  mechanism  facilitating \ncollaboration in emergency preparedness and response in the Pacific.6 \n \n7.  ADB proposes that the TA work with governments and stakeholders in Pacific DMCs to \nidentify the most vulnerable groups and highest-risk schools, markets, health clinics, or other \npublic places. The WASH and behavior change campaign will be designed to meet the needs of \nwomen, children, girls, and elderly people. The TA will also address the enabling environment of \nWASH services, and bring water utilities and other agencies with a hygiene mandate into the \nWASH clusters. Water utilities are expected to be active players in WASH campaigns in urban \ncenters, following their mandate to improve water supply and/or sanitation services coverage. \nThey will require support for WASH campaign targets in areas including willingness to pay, \nworkplace safety and health, water conservation, and financial sustainability, which will facilitate \nthe expansion of their core business, particularly as they face challenges presented by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The TA will incorporate lessons from previous and ongoing WASH service \ninterventions in the region. It will ensure the sustainability of the WASH interventions by (i) aligning \nand collaborating with existing WASH-related infrastructure projects by ADB and other donors, \n \n6  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 2020. Pacific Humanitarian Team: COVID-19 \nResponse Plan. Suva. \n ", "3 \n(ii) building consensus among decision makers on the need to prioritize WASH interventions and \nsupport WASH improvements, and (iii) supporting longer-term WASH service investment and \nfinancial sustainability with support for infrastructure and services planning to expand WASH \nactivities. The project team will identify and develop further measures to overcome barriers to \nimproving WASH campaigns throughout TA implementation. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s Pacific Urban Development, Water Supply and Sanitation Division (PAUW) has an \nactive  portfolio  in  11  Pacific  DMCs,  in  addition  to  supporting  several  regional  initiatives. \nRelationships established through these ongoing or planned operations will be a springboard to \ndevelop and refine the TA activities in each participating DMC, and to ensure alignment with \nproposed ADB-supported pipeline interventions. ADB will work through its resident missions, \nregional offices, and country offices to liaise closely with DMC counterpart agencies (including \nthose  responsible  for  health,  infrastructure,  and  utilities)  as  well  as  UNICEF  and  WHO \nrepresentative offices in the Pacific. Development partners will be kept informed of activities \nthrough the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility water and sanitation working group and other \ncoordination mechanisms to ensure that TA interventions are harmonized with the overarching \nresponse to the pandemic in the region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: health outcomes in the Pacific improved.7 \nThe TA will have the following outcome: disease transmission pathways in ADB\u2019s Pacific DMC \npopulations reduced.8 The outcome is directly aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 6.2 \nand ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities of tackling climate, building climate and disaster \nresilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  making  cities  more  livable;  and \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Water, sanitation, and hygiene practices in households and public areas \nin ADB\u2019s Pacific developing member countries improved. The proposed activities aim to \nimprove WASH practices in households and public areas by raising awareness of the link between \npoor WASH practices and the spread of communicable diseases, and by providing targeted \nfacilities to help enable behavior change. The behavior change campaigns designed by each \nproject implementation unit (PIU), in consultation with stakeholders and with the support of the \ninternational advisers, will aim to reach about 200,000 households (or 1 million people); including \nat least 500,000 women.10 These campaigns will be culturally and socially appropriate; sensitive \nto the needs of women, girls, students, and vulnerable groups; and use effective messages and \ncommunication means. Topics that may be covered through the campaigns include but are not \nlimited to hand hygiene, menstrual hygiene, safe drinking water, safe storage of food, home \n \n7  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying \nspecial attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. \n10 The estimate of beneficiaries was initially based on reaching 50%\u201370% of the urban population in the largest one to \ntwo urban centers in each DMC, noting the potentially higher risk of disease transmission in these areas with higher \npopulation densities and proximity to transport hubs, and economies of scale in the program rollout. It is estimated \nthat 50% of the population reached will have adopted improved hygiene practices by the end of the TA. Cost-per-\nbeneficiary ratios for recent WASH programs in the Pacific were used to estimate the total TA budget.  \n ", "4 \nsanitation, pit latrine safety, and the need to pay for improved WASH services. The TA will also \nfinance the installation of handwashing facilities in strategic public areas, and work with relevant \nstakeholders to develop a plan for sustainable operation and maintenance of these facilities.11  \n \n11.  Output 2: Enabling environment for improved and sustainable hygiene in ADB\u2019s \nPacific developing member countries strengthened. Access to safe and continuous WASH \nservices enables and sustains WASH outcomes. For this reason, the WASH campaign will include \noutreach activities to enhance the financial viability and operations of WASH service providers by \nraising  the  willingness  to  pay  and  educating  consumers  on  water  conservation.  The  TA \nconsultants will also identify opportunities to work closely with participating utilities on aspects of \ntheir  operations  that  support  resilience  to  pandemics,  such  as  operational  and  financial \nperformance assessments, health and safety of sanitation workers, and water safety plans and \nbusiness continuity plans, depending on the need and demand. As utilities are key players in \nurban areas and may be required to provide more service connections in support of the campaign, \nthe TA will work with them to (i) help mainstream these activities and assessments into their \noperations, and (ii) identify new investment projects that will help to further expand and improve \nservices and contribute to the sustainability of the TA interventions.  \n \n12.  Under output 2, at least three knowledge products capturing TA lessons with consideration \nof gender elements will be completed. Where possible, knowledge disseminated will help to fill \ndata gaps in Pacific DMCs by utilizing data from baseline and end line sampling surveys, which \nwill be captured in the scope of the consultant\u2019s terms of reference. This will allow measurement \nof results, highlighting the success factors and shaping the recommendations for any future \nsupport, including from ADB. The knowledge products will be disseminated through regional \nplatforms  such  as  the  ADB  Sanitation  Dialogue  and  the  Pacific  Water  and  Wastewater \nAssociation Annual Conference to support evidence-based decision-making by Pacific DMC \ngovernments and development partners. \n \n13.  Methods. After confirming their interest in participating in the TA, ADB will request \ngovernments to recommend targeted areas for support based on the impact of the pandemic, \nlocal needs, and development priorities in each DMC. The activities will differ across the DMCs \nas they will be demand-driven.12 The water utility or WASH cluster will be the TA local project \ncoordination unit (PCU) for day-to-day, in-country activities. Participating DMC governments will \nnominate a representative to be a member of the PCU. Two international consultants, who are \nlikely to provide remote inputs until travel restrictions are lifted, will be recruited to lead the TA: \n(i) a WASH adviser and team leader with strong hygiene behavior change experience, and (ii) a \nutility adviser with strong management experience of WASH service providers.  \n \n14.  The WASH adviser will undertake a rapid WASH needs assessment for each participating \nDMC, with inputs from the PCU and the utility adviser, under ADB\u2019s guidance. These rapid \nassessments will (i) map key stakeholders and players, (ii) identify relevant lessons and good \npractices,  (iii)  identify  any  ongoing  or  planned  WASH  interventions  and  opportunities  for \ncollaboration and synergies, (iv) refine the opportunities and strategic direction of the WASH \ncampaign in each DMC, (v) define the WASH campaign scope with sex-disaggregated recipient \nnumbers and the characteristics of potential beneficiaries at the household level and in key public \n \n11 The design of handwashing facilities will consider (i) cost-effectiveness of the investment for scalability; (ii) availability \nof a reliable water source; (iii) measures to limit cross-contamination (e.g., the use of pedal-operated taps and safe \nwater disposal); and (iv) accessibility for all users, including girls, the elderly, and people with limited mobility. \n12 If strong commitment is demonstrated by counterpart agencies and outputs are deemed satisfactory, activities may \nbe expanded in selected DMCs following assessment of resource availability. Conversely, some activities may be \ndiscontinued where insufficient ownership or commitment is demonstrated. \n ", "5 \nareas, (vi) identify the required contributions and role of utilities to support improved hygiene, \n(vii)  provide rough  cost  estimates for  campaign  materials,  and  (viii)  identify  bottlenecks  to \nsustaining hygiene improvements. Individual national consultants will be recruited by ADB in \nconsultation with the PCUs. The national consultants will form the WASH PIU under the PCU, \nand will be expected to facilitate engagement with the WASH clusters in relation to the TA \nactivities. They will design and implement the country-specific WASH campaign action plans in \nline with the scope and budget proposed in the rapid assessment, with consideration of practical \nimplementation approaches and securing in-country buy-in from the utility and the government to \nsupport TA activities.  \n \n15.  The pandemic makes access to safe and sustainable WASH services a more urgent \npriority. Through the TA, PAUW staff and TA consultants will also work with policy makers to \npromote WASH as a key development agenda in the DMCs to decision makers, and increase the \ngovernments\u2019 awareness of the links between WASH and the pandemic, as well as highlight the \nimportance  of  prioritizing  WASH  and  waste  management  service  interventions,  which  may \npotentially be supported by ADB. ADB expects that this sustained dialogue throughout the TA will \npromote efforts toward more transformative and longer-term WASH changes. \n \n16.  The TA will support costs related to surveys, training, communications, and materials. The \nPIU will work with the PCU on details of the materials required and associated costs, including \n(i) soap and hand sanitizer under output 1; (ii) hardware for the installation (or improvement) of \nhandwashing facilities, including taps, piping, fittings, and small water storage tanks under \noutput 2; (iii) materials to improve the condition of sanitation facilities (e.g., spare parts for latrines) \nidentified in output 1; (iv) water-saving plumbing fixtures (e.g., for cisterns and water-saving \ndevices installed in faucets) under output 2; (v) personal protective equipment (PPE) for sanitation \nworkers under outputs 1 and 2; and (vi) other materials.13 ADB will procure these low-value \nconsumable materials locally through the country office and the PIU will distribute them. Where \nappropriate, output 2 materials  are expected to be installed by the related WASH service \nproviders and maintained as part of its assets. Where practical and economical, ADB will procure \nselected materials in bulk. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $5,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($4.58 million from the TASF 6 and $0.42 million from TASF-\nOthers). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n18.  The governments of participating DMCs will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncountry data, counterpart staff (if needed), meeting rooms as required for consultants, and \npotentially other in-kind contributions as agreed during TA implementation. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency. ADB\u2019s PAUW will set up a team, which will include ADB \nstaff with expertise in different sectors and themes, to act as the TA team to administer and \nimplement the TA. The ADB task manager will lead the team, while ADB staff in country offices \nwill be team members and support coordination and monitoring. The international WASH advisor \n \n13 PPE for sanitation workers are specific to the nature of activities and the exposure risk, as distinct from general PPE \nsuch as facemasks provided to households. PPE is considered the last line of defense in risk management, and \nother proposed control measures to avoid or mitigate risk will be prioritized. \n ", "6 \nwill lead and support the PIUs; and monitor progress and report on TA activities. The TA will be \nimplemented from August 2020 to December 2023. ADB\u2019s PAUW and relevant team members in \ncountry offices will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; and procure goods and non-\nconsulting services. The TA allows flexibility to adapt the campaign plans to address changing \npriorities during implementation within an agreed framework. If the proposed approaches are \nchallenging, the implementation arrangements may be revisited in discussion with counterpart \nagencies and relevant ADB departments.
