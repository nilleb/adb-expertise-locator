This is the third loan of a program cluster \nand  builds  on  support  initiated  under  subprogram  2,  approved  by  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in September 2008. The loan is to be \nprovided  as  a  single  tranche,  based  on  completed  prior  actions \ndemonstrating satisfactory progress.  \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Public sector management (economic and public \naffairs management) \nThemes (subthemes): Economic growth (promoting macroeconomic \nstability), governance (public administration), private sector development \n(private sector investment) \nLocation impact: National (low impact) \nPartnership: Government of Japan \n   \nEnvironment  Category C       \nAssessment \n   \nThe Program  The  Government's  implementation  of  its  Medium-Term  Philippine \nRationale  Development Plan (MTPDP) is stimulating higher and more sustainable \neconomic growth (7% per annum by 2009), creating jobs (1 million jobs \ncreated by 2009), and reducing poverty. Poverty rates have declined over \nthe past 2 decades, but recently increased (to 33% of the population in \n2006 from 30% in 2003). The critical fiscal situation that emerged in 2002 \ncompressed public investment and funding for the social sectors and hurt \nthe poor. These problems were compounded by poor governance in public \nfinancial management, corruption in procurement, and a weak investment \nclimate.  \n \nReforms  supporting  fiscal  consolidation;  strengthening  governance  in \npublic  financial  management;  reducing  corruption  in  key  government \nagencies; and improving the investment climate, rural development, and \ninfrastructure are crucially important to putting economic growth on a more \nsustainable  path,  redirecting  spending  to  the  social  sectors,  and \ncontributing to poverty reduction. The ADB studies, Philippines: Critical \nDevelopment Constraints in 2007, and Philippines: Reforming Investment \nIncentives in 2009, confirmed that these areas are critical to growth in the \nPhilippines and were used in formulating subprogram 3. \n \nUnder subprogram 1, the Government implemented a series of measures \nto  address  the  fiscal  imbalance,  resulting  in  a  swift  and  impressive \nturnaround in the fiscal situation and greater macroeconomic stability in \n2006 and 2007. Subprogram 2 in 2008 built on reforms initiated under \nsubprogram 1 on fiscal consolidation and governance in public financial \nmanagement  and  procurement.  These  measures  have  provided  much \nneeded  fiscal  space  for  greater  spending  on  the  social  sectors  and \n ", " ii \n \ninfrastructure in 2007 and 2008. With higher spending for priority sectors, \nset  within  a  medium-term  balanced  budget  framework,  the  Philippines \nenjoyed  its  best  recent  macroeconomic  performance  in  2007  with \neconomic growth at 7.2% and investment growth at 11.5%. This growth \nmomentum continued into the first quarter of 2008.  \n \nHowever, 2008 began with a surge in global commodity prices. By the \nthird quarter, domestic food price inflation had reached 25% in the third \nquarter on a year-on-year basis and this contributed to a slowdown in \ndomestic consumption and an increase in poverty. The global financial \ncrisis  intensified  in  September  2008  and  adversely  affected  Philippine \nfinancial markets in two ways: (i) balance sheet deleveraging in the United \nStates meant investors unbundled financial portfolios in the Philippines, \nleading to some capital flight in the second half of 2008; and (ii) the global \ncredit crunch has made it more expensive for the Philippines to access \ninternational debt markets, in both public and private sectors.  \n \nHowever, the major impact on the Philippine economy is the second-round \neffects of global demand decline and the impact on the Government's \nfiscal situation. Economic growth decelerated sharply in the first quarter of \n2009  following  a  40%  plunge  in  external  demand  for  exports  from \nDecember 2008 to April 2009 and lack of growth in inflows of remittances \nin  the  first  semester  of  2009.  The  Government  has  revised  its \nmacroeconomic framework and projects growth at 0.8%\u20131.8% in 2009 \nwith higher unemployment. Development partners project a lower growth \nrate in the range of \u20131.0% to 1.0% on the back of faltering exports, stalling \nforeign investments, and a projected drop in remittances. These growth \nforecasts would translate to a decline in per capita incomes in the range of \n\u20133.0% to \u20130.2%, thereby threatening to raise poverty further in 2009.   \n \nThe Government has responded to the global crisis in two ways. First, it \nhas introduced preemptive measures to support macroeconomic stability. \nSecond, it has provided for a modest fiscal expansion in the order of 2.3% \nof gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009. The stimulus will come from \nhigher infrastructure and social spending, and cash transfers to the poor. \nThe sharp cyclical downturn in the economy has also affected the fiscal \nsituation through a decline in tax revenues of 5.2% in the first semester of \n2009. As a result of the increase in spending and falling revenues, the \nGovernment revised its estimate of the national government deficit to 3.2% \nof GDP in 2009.  \n \nSubprogram 3 builds on reforms initiated under subprogram 2 for fiscal \nconsolidation  and  strengthening  of  governance  in  public  financial \nmanagement  and  procurement.  It  also  increases  the  focus  on \ninstitutionalizing  governance  programs  within  agencies  to  ensure  their \nlonger-term  sustainability  and  effective  enforcement,  strengthening  the \ninvestment  climate,  and  carrying  out  social  assistance  programs. \nResponding to the global financial crisis, subprogram 3 also includes a \nseries of policy measures to address the increased vulnerabilities and \nrisks to the Philippine economy from the global financial crisis and the \nimpacts on poverty. These reforms are designed to: (i) improve fiscal \n ", "  iii \nsustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability,  and  improve \ncreditworthiness; (ii) enhance governance in public financial management \nand speed up disbursements of critical public spending; (iii) improve the \ninvestment  climate  and  rural  development;  and \n(iv) enhance human capital and social inclusion.  \n \nAlso in response to the global economic crisis, subprogram 3 adds a post- \nprogram monitoring framework with forward-looking policy measures. The \nGovernment of the Philippines, ADB, and the Government of Japan have \nagreed to a post-DPSP framework with policy measures in order to create \nthe  basis  for  continuous  policy  dialogue  and  engagement  during  the \ncritical period of 2009\u20132010 before the Philippine presidential elections in \nMay 2010. The monitoring framework focuses on the Government's short-\nterm  plan,  advancing  its  reforms  in  fiscal  policy,  public  financial \nmanagement,  and  selected  areas  in  investment  climate  and  poverty, \nsupported by ADB, the Government of Japan, and other development \npartners' technical and program assistance.   \n \nThe DPSP  is a joint effort of ADB, the Government of Japan (Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency)  and  other  development  partners  to \nsupport and deepen a common reform agenda with the Government. It \nreflects the Government\u2019s commitment to its reforms over the medium \nterm, and ADB\u2019s commitment over the medium term to provide financial \nsupport to program implementation. The Government of Japan provided \nparallel financing of subprogram 2 in March 2009 and will provide parallel \nfinancing for subprogram 3. In formulating the DPSP, the Government, \nADB, and the Government of Japan have drawn on the Government\u2019s \nagenda as articulated through the Philippines Development Forum and its \nsector strategies. ADB and the Government of Japan have coordinated \nreviews of subprogram 3 policy triggers with the Government. Formulation \nof subprogram 3 has benefited from input from the Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID),  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID), and the World Bank.  \n   \nImpact and  The impact of subprogram 3 will be to restore the Philippines to a longer-\nOutcome  term, sustainable, and higher growth path and to lower unemployment. \nThe outcome of the subprogram 3 will be more investment through greater \nfiscal sustainability, better public financial management, a more attractive \ninvestment climate, and enhanced human capital and social inclusion. To \nachieve these objectives, subprogram 3 will support the following strategic \nreforms:  \n \n(i)  improvements  to  fiscal  sustainability,  maintenance  of \nmacroeconomic  stability,  and  better  creditworthiness  by \nenhancing the quality of fiscal management by (a) increasing tax \nrevenues  for  2008\u20132009  through  tax  policy  reforms, \n(b)  strengthening  tax  administration  and  enforcement,  and \nreducing  revenue  leaks  through  improved  governance, \n(c) reducing inefficient spending to permit increased social and \npoverty-related spending, (d) strengthening the debt management \nstrategy  to  manage  government  contingent  liabilities  and  risks \n ", " iv \n \nprudently, and (e) giving depositors' confidence in the domestic \nbanking system; \n(ii)  enhancements to public financial management  governance by \n(a) improving budget preparation, budget execution, accounting, \nrecording,  and  reporting;  (b)  strengthening  performance \nmanagement and improving public service delivery; (c) reforming \nprocurement;  (d)  implementing  anticorruption  and  enforcement \nstrategies for revenue-collecting agencies, and key procurement \nagencies;  and  (e)  sustaining  critical  public  expenditures  while \nmaintaining budget discipline to mitigate the poverty impacts of \nthe deceleration in growth; \n(iii)  improvements to the investment climate and promotion of rural \ndevelopment  by  (a)  clarifying  and  strengthening  the  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  for  investments  and  trade,  (b)  facilitating \ninfrastructure  development  through  greater  public\u2013private \nparticipation  and  better  coordination  of  public  infrastructure \ninvestments, and (c) improving rural\u2013urban connectivity; and  \n(iv)  enhancements to human capital and social inclusion by improving \nthe  policy  framework  for  social  protection,  sustaining  real \nspending  on  health  and  education,  improving  the  targeting  of \nprograms, piloting the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program \ntied  to  performance  outcomes  in  child  education  and  health, \nrefining public employment programs, and establishing a national \npoverty  monitoring  and  response  system  to  help  mitigate  the \nimpact of the economic slowdown on poverty. \n \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $250,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility  for  subprogram  3  of  the  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 \nyears, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nprogram loan agreement.  \n   \nPeriod and  The subprogram 3 period is from October 2008 to September 2009, with a \nTranching  single tranche loan of $250 million to be disbursed when the Government \nhas met the conditions for loan effectiveness.  \n   \nCounterpart  The Government will use the local currency counterpart funds generated \nFunds  by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures and associated costs \nof  reform,  and  to  help  maintain  current  social  expenditure  and \ninfrastructure spending. \n   \nExecuting  Department of Finance (DOF)  \nAgency  \n   \nImplementation  The  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM)  will  be  the \nArrangements  Implementing Agency responsible for implementing subprogram 3. It will \nbe supported by relevant government line agencies, including the Office of \nthe Ombudsman, the Department of Education, Department of Agriculture, \nDepartment  of  Health,  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways, \n ", "  v \nDepartment  of  Trade  and  Industry,  and  the  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment  Authority  (NEDA).  The  DPSP  coordinating  committee \nchaired by the DOF undersecretary and comprising officials from DOF, \nDBM,  and  NEDA,  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  program \nimplementation and sustaining subprogram 3 actions with the DBM and \nrelevant government line agencies involved in supporting the DPSP. The \ncommittee  will  meet  quarterly  to  monitor  progress,  oversee  program \nimplementation, and provide guidance and direction to DOF and DBM.  \n   \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs \nDisbursement  (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by \nother  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for \nProgram Loans (1998). \n \nProgram Benefits  The DPSP will provide the following significant benefits:  \nand Beneficiaries    \n(i)  progress  toward  medium-term  fiscal  sustainability  will  promote \nmacroeconomic stability and foster broad-based economic growth, \njob creation, and poverty reduction, all of which are cornerstones of \nthe Government\u2019s MTPDP and the Philippines Development Forum \n(the  successful  fiscal  consolidation  programs  since  2004  have \ncreated  fiscal  space  in  2009  and  2010  that  will  enable  the \nGovernment to mitigate the poverty impact from the global financial \ncrisis); \n(ii)  better  governance  of  public  financial  management  will  improve \nprioritization and efficiency of spending in key sectors such as the \nsocial sectors; \n(iii)  lower transaction costs for business, because of the reduction in \nbureaucracy, will open new opportunities, increase investment and \nproductivity, boost the economy, increase incomes, and create jobs; \n(iv)  higher  infrastructure  spending  will  generate  long-term  growth, \nstimulate investment, create jobs, and raise incomes; \n(v)  improved social sector outcomes will result from higher spending, \nbetter-targeted social assistance programs, and implementation of \nthe CCT program linked to better outcomes for child education and \nhealth; and \n(vi)  key governance programs will be more sustainable, as the DPSP \nwill  help  to  institutionalize  programs,  including  the  medium-term \nexpenditure framework and integrity development reviews, and the  \nDOF\u2019s anticorruption revenue initiatives in the Bureau of Internal \nRevenue  and the Bureau of Customs.   \n   \nRisks and  The  DPSP  is  firmly  embedded  in  the  MTPDP,  the  Philippines \nAssumptions  Development  Forum,  and  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  sector  strategies \ncovering  its  fiscal  program,  tax  administration  reform,  public  financial \nmanagement,  procurement  reform,  investment  competitiveness,  rural \ndevelopment,  and  social  protection.  The  assumptions  underlying  the \nDPSP include the following:   \n ", " vi \n \n(i)  The economy will be able to continue withstand the direct effects of \nthe global financial crisis on Philippine financial markets. \n(ii)  The Government will maintain fiscal expansion in 2009 and 2010 \nwithin a disciplined fiscal framework. \n(iii)  The  Government  will  stay  on  course  with  key  policy  reform \nmeasures, and continue to liaise effectively with Congress.  \n \nHowever, the DPSP has risks:  \n \n(i)  The global financial crisis has hurt the Philippines. The second-round \neffects of the decline in global demand have had repercussions on \nthe Government's fiscal situation in an environment of elevated risk \nand  higher  cost  of  financing.  A  prolonged  global  recession  and \ndysfunctional credit markets would place further stress on the fiscal \nsituation as about $8.0 billion of public external debt matures in 2009 \nand  2010.  The  economic  slowdown  in  the  Philippines  and  the \npossibility  that  remittances  may  decline  would  feed  into  higher \npoverty in 2009. However, these potential effects on poverty would \nbe partially offset through the scaling up of the CCT and an increase \nin infrastructure development in 2009 and 2010. \n(ii)  With the economic stresses in 2009 and an election in 2010, the \nGovernment may be tempted to introduce populist policies that could \nthreaten  fiscal  discipline  in  2010.  However,  the  Government  has \nannounced that its budget target for 2010 is 2.5% of GDP and since \n2006 it has demonstrated commitment to meeting its fiscal targets. In \n2009, it is operating one of the lowest deficits in the region. The post-\nprogram monitoring framework will enable ADB to continue dialogue \nwith Government on fiscal policy. \n(iii)  The 2010 presidential elections may slow implementation of reforms. \nHowever, the Government has full ownership of the DPSP reform \nprogram, which is embedded in the Philippines Development Forum \nand  its  sector  strategies.  Moreover,  the  Government  of  the \nPhilippines, ADB, and the Government of Japan have agreed to a \npost-program  monitoring  framework  with  triggers  to  track  the \nGovernment's commitment to its reform agenda. \n ", "  vii \nTechnical  Policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) is included with subprogram \nAssistance  3. The TA is estimated to cost $1.15 million equivalent. ADB will provide \n$800,000 on a grant basis from the ADB Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF\u2014other sources). The Government will provide the remaining \n$350,000 in kind by providing counterpart staff and other facilities. \n \nThis is the second of three TA projects for public financial management \nenvisaged  over  the  next  3 years.  The  three  projects  will  strengthen \ncapacity  at  the  DBM  and  line  ministries  to  implement  public  financial \nmanagement  reforms.  The  TA  will  support  the  DBM,  the  Bureau  of \nTreasury,  and  the  DOF  in  implementing  and  monitoring  key  public \nfinancial management reforms. Component 1 will support the DBM and \nthe  Bureau  of  Treasury  to  strengthen  cash  management  and  budget \nexecution  procedures  and  processes.  It  will  support  the  rollout  of  the \ninternal control systems across national line agencies. Component 2 will \nsupport the interagency task force to develop a road map and action plan \nfor integrating the government financial management information system. \nComponent 3 will support capacity development at the new debt and risk \nmanagement division at DOF, which will be responsible for drafting a debt \nmanagement strategy and policies.  \n \nA team of international and national consultants will implement the TA. \nADB will engage a combination of a consulting firm and individuals in \naccordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The firm will be engaged following quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  (80:20  quality\u2013cost  ratio)  using  simplified  technical \nproposal.  A  total  of  51  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be \nrequired (18 international and 33 national).   \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 3 of the Development Policy Support Program \n(DPSP).1 The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Improving Public \nFinancial  Management,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  The Global Crisis \n2.  The proposed DPSP subprogram 3 comes at a critical time for the Philippines. It is \ndesigned to maintain the momentum of its key development efforts at a time of global financial \nmarket failure and global recession. Like many other developing economies, the Philippines has \nhad to cope with the first-round effects of the turmoil and the crisis of confidence that has \ndisrupted  the  global  financial  system  and  limited  the  country's  access  to  commercial  debt \nmarkets since September 2008 (Appendix 4). Coming into the global crisis, the Philippines\u2019 \nmacroeconomic performance was sound. The economy expanded by 3.8% in 2008\u2014half the \n7.3% in 2007, but above the regional average. The primary budget has been in surplus for the \nlast 3 years and its overall deficit for 2008 was 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), low by \ninternational standards. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio has continuously declined from over 80% in \n2003 to 56% by the end of 2008.   \n \n3.  The Philippines is now experiencing the second-round effects of the global recession, \nwhich may be larger than those caused by the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis. The economies \nof the Philippines\u2019 major trading partners and recipients of Filipino workers have entered severe \nrecessions. Global trade contracted by about 9% in the first quarter of 2009\u2014the first time since \n1982. Consequently, Philippine exports (mainly influenced by the sharp contraction in exports of \nelectronics) contracted by about 40% from December to April 2009 on a year-on-year basis. A \nconsensus in the international community is that the global economy may only experience a \ngradual recovery in 2010 and this turnaround will depend critically on more concerted policy \nactions  to  stabilize  financial  conditions  and  bolster  demand  through  fiscal  expansion  and \nmonetary policy. The Government has learned from the 1997\u20131998 financial crisis and its 2009 \nbudget included greater discretionary spending mainly on infrastructure, social sectors, and \ncash  transfers  to  the  poor.  As  a  result  of  these  spending  initiatives  and  lower  projected \nrevenues, the 2009 budget deficit is projected to rise to 3.2% of GDP and the Government's net \nfinancing requirements will be about P270.6 billion. Despite policy makers' immediate focus on \nthe current economic crisis, the Government also considers the crisis to be an opportunity to \nachieve consensus among stakeholders on difficult policy issues and to advance its medium-\nterm  development  objectives  in  fiscal  policy,  public  financial  management,  the  investment \nclimate, and social sectors, recognizing that these reforms have helped the Philippines to \nweather this crisis and to position it for recovery.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

The Government and its Development Strategy \n4.  The  DPSP  program  cluster  supports  the  Government's  development  strategy  as \ndescribed in its Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan, 2004\u20132010 (MTPDP), which sets \nout the country\u2019s development priorities, policy agenda, programs, and projects. 2  The key \nobjectives of the MTPDP are to achieve higher and more sustainable economic growth, create \njobs, reduce poverty, and make progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It \nidentifies  the  major  challenges  as  the  fiscal  imbalance,  inadequate  infrastructure,  rapid \nurbanization  and  congestion  (especially  in  Metro  Manila),  increasing  unemployment,  and \ninefficient delivery of basic services. \n \n5.  In 2005, the Government and its international development partners decided to convert \nannual consultative group meetings into the Philippines Development Forum (PDF). The PDF \nprovides an opportunity for ongoing dialogue and for involving other stakeholders, such as civil \nsociety, the private sector, and the academic community. The Government convenes the PDF \nto  discuss  the  reform  agenda  and  how  the  development  partners  can  assist  with \nimplementation.3 The PDF allows the development partners to provide an impetus to MTPDP \nimplementation. Currently the PDF has seven working groups,4 each focusing on priority areas \nof the Government\u2019s development agenda. In March 2006, the Government agreed with the \nWorld Bank that the PDF agenda would be used as the basis for a World Bank development \npolicy loan. Shortly thereafter, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was invited to join the \nprocess and to prepare the reform agenda through the DPSP. The agenda was refined and \nmodified through subsequent PDF workshops in 2007 and 2008 to reflect the Government\u2019s \nnew priorities, and its short- and medium-term challenges. When the DPSP was first formulated \nin 2006 (footnote 1], it was anchored on four core areas of the PDF: (i) fiscal consolidation, (ii) \ngovernance, (iii) the investment climate and infrastructure, and (iv) social progress. At the \nrequest of the Government in 2008, subprogram 3 of the DPSP added rural development to the \ninvestment climate component, reflecting the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s increased focus on \nimproving the investment climate. \n \n6.  To  help  implement  the  MTPDP  priorities,  the  Government  adopted  several  sector \nstrategies,  most  with  a  time-bound  implementation  plan  and  clearly  defined  ministerial \nresponsibilities;  some  are  supported  by  ADB  sector  programs  and  technical  assistance \n(Appendix 9). The fiscal consolidation strategy, which began in 2004, outlined the Government\u2019s \nfiscal stabilization and consolidation strategy up to 2010. It was successful in reducing the \nnational government budget deficit from 5.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003 to 0.2% \nin 2007 and 0.9% in 2008. Perhaps one of the most important achievements of the fiscal \nconsolidation program has been the creation of fiscal space to mitigate some of the poverty \nimpacts from the global crisis in 2009. In particular, the program has resulted in an increased \nshare of discretionary spending; from 26% of total budget expenditures in 2006 to 37% in 2008, \nwith  the  social  sectors  and  infrastructure  the  main  beneficiaries  (Appendix  4).  As  a \nconsequence  of  the  global  crisis  and  its  adverse  impact  on  the  Philippine  economy,  the \nGovernment relaxed its medium-term fiscal target for 2009 from a national government budget \ndeficit of 0.5% of GDP to 3.2% of GDP and has delayed balancing its budget until 2013. The \nGovernment\u2019s budget and procurement reform agenda, under the Department of Budget and \nManagement  (DBM),  is  focused  on  implementing  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework \n                                                 \n2  Government of the Philippines. 2004.

The Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) under \nthe  DBM  has  set  out  a  3-year  action  plan  for  2007\u20132010  to  implement  the  Government \nProcurement Reform Act, 2003. ADB is actively working with GPPB to harmonize Government \nand  ADB  procurement  procedures,  and  to  strengthen  the  operations  of  the  Philippine \ngovernment  electronic  procurement  system  (PhilGEPS),  which  is  mandated  under  the \nprocurement law as the portal for posting procurement agencies\u2019 bid notices and awards. The \nGovernment and stakeholders of the PDF working group on sustainable rural development held \na strategic agribusiness planning workshop in March 2009 toward formulation of the Strategic \nAgribusiness Development Plan with assistance from the Government of Japan. \n \nC.  The Government and Its Development Partners \n7.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program, 2005\u20132007 for the Philippines identified three key \npriorities for ADB assistance: reducing macroeconomic instability (through fiscal consolidation \nand better public financial management), improving the investment climate, and meeting the \nneeds  of  the  social  sectors.5 The  DPSP  puts  this  strategy  into  operation  by  providing  an \numbrella operation that complements and reinforces ADB\u2019s sector program loans and projects. \nThe DPSP, structured as a program cluster, aims to help the Government achieve its medium- \nto long-term goals of sustained economic growth of 6%\u20137% per annum, lower unemployment, \nand a reduction in poverty, as highlighted in the development policy letter addressed to the ADB \nPresident (Appendix 2). For effective development results, the DPSP focuses on a broad policy \nagenda  that  addresses  thematic  and  crosscutting  issues  in  four  core  areas:  (i)  fiscal \nsustainability; (ii) governance in public financial management and anticorruption initiatives in the \nkey  revenue-raising  agencies,  (iii) the  investment  climate,  and  rural  development,  and  (iv) \nhuman capital and social inclusion. These are all key outcomes and outputs of the ADB Country \nStrategy and Program.  \n \n8.  The DPSP emphasizes the achievement of measurable policy results, while leaving \ndetailed policy prescriptions to programs, projects and TA in individual sectors. In this way, it \ncomplements and reinforces ADB\u2019s sector loan programs and projects, which are aligned with \nthe  Government\u2019s  strategies  (para.  6).  For  example,  under  the  first  pillar,  macroeconomic \nstability, the Local Government Financing and Budget Reform Program finances budget reforms \nand financing for local government units (LGUs) supported by TA.6 This complements the DPSP, \nwhich focuses on the national government budget. Similarly, the Governance in Justice Reform \nProgram is supporting better public financial management systems to the justice sector.7 TA \nprojects on national tax administration and public financial management are building capacity in \nthese areas, including (i) capacity development support for the restructured Bureau of Internal \nRevenue (BIR) Enforcement and Advisory Service (EAS) for tax prosecutions, and (ii) piloting \ninternal control systems within national government agencies, LGUs, and the Supreme Court.8 \nUnder the second pillar, the investment climate, ADB\u2019s strategic focus has been on the energy \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

The Power Sector Development Program loan has deepened the market for energy, \nwith the establishment of a wholesale energy market and led to the privatization of 70% of the \nNational Power Corporation\u2019s energy assets by the end of 2008. 9 The Infrastructure for Rural \nProductivity Enhancement Sector Project supports infrastructure development in the southern \nPhilippines and is expected to construct 800\u20131,000 km of rural feeder roads, 5,000 hectares of \ncommon irrigation, and about 100 portable water systems.10  In addition, ADB has continuing \noperations  in  the  urban,  rural,  and  water  sectors  such  as  coastal  fisheries  and  resource \nmanagement, agrarian reform, and infrastructure; these have had a positive affect on the rural \ninvestment climate and poverty reduction.11 Under the third pillar of the social sectors, ADB has \nadopted  innovative  approaches  to  assistance  in  the  health12 and  education13 sectors  with \nobjectives that are consistent with the Government\u2019s MDGs and targets.  \n \n9.  Medium-Term  Programmatic  Approach.  The  key  features  of  the  DPSP  include:  \n(i) three single-tranche operations, with a well-defined, medium-term framework specified at the \noutset and including completed high-impact reforms; (ii) triggers for subsequent subprograms to \nensure  a  continuous  dialogue  between  the  Government,  development  partners,  and \nstakeholders; and (iii) a small number of well-targeted policy actions designed to achieve high-\nimpact outcomes in priority sectors. In this way, the DPSP provides a coherent medium-term \nreform  strategy  with  three  discrete  but  linked  subprograms  and  a  strong  emphasis  on \nperformance, as the decision on whether to proceed with the next subprogram is contingent on \ntriggers that reflect overall satisfactory performance. It recognizes the necessity for flexibility in \nthe reform measures, with provisions for incorporating lessons and responding to changes in \nthe external environment in the design of downstream subprograms. \n  \n10.  The DPSP has the four phases: \n(i)  Subprogram 1. Financed by ADB ($250 million) in 2007, this supported the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal consolidation program, creating the basis for continuous \npolicy dialogue and engagement during 2007\u20132009 (footnote 1). \n(ii)  Subprogram 2. Financed by ADB ($250 million) with parallel financing from the \nGovernment  of  Japan  ($100  million),  this  supported  the  Government's  fiscal \nsustainability program and efforts to strengthen governance in public financial \nmanagement  and procurement.14 \n(iii)  Subprogram 3. The present phase, to be financed by ADB ($250 million) with \nparallel  financing  from  the  Government  of  Japan,  increases  the  focus  on \ninstitutionalizing  governance  programs,  including  the  anticorruption  revenue \nprograms at the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Bureau of Customs \n(BOC), the investment climate, and the social sectors.  \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006.

In  response  to  the  global  economic  crisis,  an \ninnovation  added  at  the  subprogram  3  phase  is  a  post-program  monitoring \nframework. The Government of the Philippines, ADB, and the Government of \nJapan  have  agreed  to  establish a  post-DPSP  framework  for  a  period  of  12 \nmonths, creating the basis for continuous policy dialogue and engagement during \nthe critical period 2009\u20132010 before the Philippine presidential elections in May \n2010. The monitoring framework focuses on the Government's short-term plan \nfor  advancing  its  reforms  in  fiscal  policy,  public  financial  management,  and \nselected  areas  in  investment  climate  and  poverty,  supported  by  ADB,  the \nGovernment of Japan, and other development partners' technical and program \nassistance.   \n \n11.  Government and development partner coordination. The DPSP is a joint effort of \nADB,  the  Government  of  Japan  (Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency),  and  other \ndevelopment partners to support and deepen a common reform agenda with the Government. It \nreflects  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  its  reforms  over  the  medium  term,  and  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to provide financial support for program implementation over the same period. The \nGovernment of Japan provided parallel cofinancing of $100 million for subprogram 2 in March \n2009 and will provide parallel cofinancing of $100 million\u2013$150 million for subprogram 3.15 In \nformulating the DPSP, the Government, ADB, and the Government of Japan have drawn on the \nGovernment\u2019s agenda as articulated through the PDF and its sector strategies. ADB and the \nGovernment  of  Japan  have  coordinated  reviews  of  subprogram  3  policy  triggers  with  the \nGovernment. The formulation of subprogram 3 benefited from input from the Australian Agency \nfor  International  Development  (AusAID),  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID), and the World Bank. The World Bank is at an early stage of discussion \nwith the Government on a possible development policy loan program to mitigate the impact of \nthe crisis and support the Government's second-round fiscal stimulus program in 2010. The \nWB's DPL will partly draw from and build on subprogram 3 of the DPSP.   This would follow on \nfrom  the  World  Bank's  proposed  social  welfare  development  reform  project  that  provides \nearmarked budget support to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and \nits single-tranche food crisis response program loan approved by its Board in December 2008 \nand disbursed in 2009.16 Appendix 3 provides the development partner coordination matrix.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR  \nA.  Recent Economic Developments and the Impacts of the Global Financial Crisis \n12.  Resilient  macroeconomic  performance  in  2008.  Until  September  2008,  the \nPhilippines was able to withstand the negative impacts of the global crisis because of the \nGovernment's sound macroeconomic and fiscal policy, a more resilient financial sector, and \nadequate levels of foreign reserves (Table 1). Economic growth was 3.8% above the regional \naverage (Figure 1). The current balance of payments account recorded a respectable surplus of \n$4.2 billion (2.5% of GDP) for 2008, buoyed by record remittances of $16.4 billion. However, \nsignificant portfolio capital outflow in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 reduced the overall \nbalance of payments position from a solid $8.5 billion surplus in 2007 to an $89 million surplus \nin 2008. Inflation has continued to fall since its peak in September 2008 and by July 2009 the \n                                                 \n15  ADB and the Government of Japan (Japan International Cooperation Agency) signed a procedural agreement on \n18  May  2009  formalizing  the  parallel  cofinancing  arrangement  for  Development  Policy  Support  Program, \nSubprogram 2. The procedural agreement was also acknowledged by the finance secretary of the Department of \nFinance.  \n16 World Bank. 2008. Food Crisis Response Development Policy Operation. Washington, DC.  \n ", "6     \n \nheadline inflation rate was 0.2% and the core inflation rate 3.3% on a year-on-year basis, which \nwas within the Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) inflation target of 2.5%\u20134.5% for 2009. \nAnother key feature of the resilient macroeconomic framework in 2008 was prudent fiscal \nmanagement. The Government's overall deficit was P68 billion in 2008 (0.9% of GDP), the third \nconsecutive year that the national government budget deficit was below 1% of GDP (Figure 3a). \nThe consolidated public sector budget, which includes balances of government-owned and \ncontrolled corporations (GOCCs) and LGUs, remained in surplus for a third consecutive year, \nsurpassing the medium-term target of a balanced consolidated public sector budget in 2010. As \na consequence, the national government debt to GDP ratio remained relatively stable at 56% \n(60% for nonfinancial sector public debt).  \n \n13.  The  global  crisis  and  its  impact  on  the  Philippine  economy.  Like  many  other \ndeveloping economies, the Philippines has had to cope with the first-round effects of the turmoil \nand a crisis of confidence that has disrupted the global financial system since September 2008. \nPhilippine financial markets were significantly affected by capital flight in the second half of 2008 \nand the global credit crunch has made it more expensive for the Philippine public and private \nsectors to access international debt markets (Appendix 4). However, the major impact on the \nPhilippine economy is the second-round effects of the collapse in global demand and its fiscal \nrepercussions. The condition of the global economy deteriorated markedly in the fourth quarter \nof 2008 and new economic data on the global economy released in March 2009 confirm a much \ndeeper, broader and protracted recession in several of the Philippines\u2019 major trading partners \nnot seen since World War II.  The Philippine economy contracted by 2.3% in the first quarter of \n2009 on a quarter-on-quarter basis (adjusted for seasonal effects), as external demand for \nexports plunged (Figure 1, b\u2013d). Tourist arrivals have fallen heavily, dropping 15% at the end of \nDecember 2008 on a year-on-year basis. Remittances have held up much better than trade in \ngoods and other services, but growth has virtually stalled with 2.9% growth in the first semester \nof 2009 compared with 15% growth for the same period in 2008. ADB staff estimate that \nremittances could fall by 2%\u20134% in the second half of 2009, based on the experience of the \n1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis when remittances to the Philippines from overseas Filipino \nworkers residing in Singapore and Hong Kong declined by an average of 7% when these two \neconomies experienced recessionary conditions. \n \n14.  Against this background, the Government has revised its macroeconomic framework \nand projects growth at 0.8%\u20131.8% in 2009, with higher unemployment and poverty. Further \nrevisions downward are expected. Development partners project a growth rate in the range of  \n\u20131.0% to 1.0% in 2009 on the back of faltering exports, stalling foreign investments, and a \nprojected drop in remittances. These projections would translate to a per capita income decline \nin the range of \u20133.0%  to \u20131.0% and a probable increase in poverty.  \n \n15.  Repercussions of the crisis on fiscal policy. The global financial crisis has affected \nfiscal policy in three ways. First, the contraction in the economy means that it is necessary for \nthe  Government  to  provide  a  modest  stimulus  in  2009,  while  maintaining  fiscal  discipline. \nSecond, the contraction in the economy in the first quarter of 2009 has resulted in a decline in \ntax collections. As a result of the increased spending and projected decline in revenues, the \nGovernment projects the deficit to rise to 3.2% of GDP in 2009. Third, tight liquidity in global \ncredit markets and elevated risks have raised the cost of financing the budget and refinancing \npublic debt.

Employment  losses  and  job  insecurity.  Until  mid-2008,  the  sustained  economic \nexpansion was beginning to improve the Philippines' stubbornly high unemployment rate for the \nfirst time in a decade. Lower long-term economic growth coupled with relatively restrictive labor \nregulations meant longer-term unemployment in the Philippines was higher than in its regional \nneighbors. In 2007, the unemployment rate fell to an average of 7.3% from 7.9% in 2006. The \nlatest data for April 2009 indicate an increase in the average unemployment rate to 7.6%. The \nGovernment is deeply concerned that the current global financial crisis will reverse its efforts to \nreduce unemployment and therefore poverty and that it will lead to a significant reduction in \neconomic growth, retrenchments, domestic employment opportunities, and returns of overseas \nFilipino workers made redundant in recession-hit countries. Recent retrenchment data from the \nDepartment of Labor and Employment point to tens of thousands of layoffs, particularly in export \nindustries and urban centers. An ADB household survey in February 2009 reported elevated \nfeelings of job insecurity among workers with 20% of employed workers feeling they may not be \nin their current job within the next 12 months, of which one-fifth of these workers (or 4% of total \nworkers surveyed) expect to lose their jobs because of the performance of the economy (Figure \n2).17 Sixty percent of employed workers expect it to be more difficult to find a new or better job in \n2009 than in 2008. The initial impact of job and income losses will probably occur in the major \nurban  industrial  centers  and  among  the  nonpoor  and  near-poor  since  wage  workers  are \nconcentrated among these groups of households. However, multiplier effects and a potential fall \nin remittances mean the impacts of the crisis will be broader and the incidence of poverty and its \nseverity will rise.  \n \n17.  Government\u2019s policy response. The Government's response has been twofold. First, it \ntook a number of preemptive measures to increase liquidity in the domestic bank system, \nproviding depositors with assurance and strengthening the BSP's lender of last resort facility. \nSecond, it provided a modest fiscal stimulus in the national government budget for 2009 (para. \n16). In the financial sector, the key measures include the following: (i) the BSP strengthened its \nlender of last resort facility by increasing its budget for the peso rediscounting facility from \nP20 billion to P40 billion on 14 November 2008, and opened a dollar repo facility on 20 October \n2008 to ensure dollar liquidity with the banks\u2019 dollar-denominated Philippine sovereign bonds as \nunderlying collateral; (ii) the BSP increased liquidity in the banking system by easing monetary \n                                                 \n17 ADB.

These measures have improved the key indicators of banking sector soundness and \nfinancial sector stability since December 2008 (Appendix 4).  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities  \n1.  Fiscal Sustainability and Macroeconomic Stability \n18.  Fiscal program. In mid-2008, the Government decided, and its development partners \nconcurred, that the balanced budget target date should be pushed back to 2010 to provide \nflexibility in fiscal policy in 2008 and 2009 for programs to mitigate the impact of increases in \nfood prices on the poor and to maintain priority spending programs if the economy slowed down. \nThe Government targeted a deficit of no more than 1% of GDP in 2008, 0.5% in 2009, and a \nbalanced  budget  in  2010.  However,  with  the  severe  contraction  in  global  demand  since \nSeptember 2008 and the recognition by the Government and its development partners that a \nlarger fiscal expansion is needed, the Government has revised its medium-term fiscal program. \nIt plans an increase in the national government budget deficit to 3.2% of GDP in 2009, 2% in \n2010, and a balanced budget by 2013. The 2009 national government budget deficit translates \nto  an  actual  fiscal  expansion  of  up  to  2.3%  of  GDP  over  2008  levels,18 low  by  regional \nstandards.19 It covers less than one-half of the expected negative output gap in 2009 (i.e., the \ngap between potential and actual economic growth, Figure 3). In the current global environment, \nthe Government faces challenges to its fiscal program in both the short and medium terms. In \nthe short term, the Government needs to ensure that its fiscal expansion in 2009 provides an \neffective stimulus to the economy. This will mean ensuring that the stimulus is timely, well \ntargeted, temporary, and transparent. In this regard, a key challenge will be to maintain critical \npublic  spending  and  to  speed  up  disbursements  for  infrastructure  spending  in  the  key \nprocurement agencies. Measures should focus on lifting the relatively low absorptive capacity \nrates  of  key  spending  agencies,  better  cash  management,  advancing  the  infrastructure \nprocurement process, and scaling up targeted social assistance and employment programs. \nWith tax collections falling in the first quarter of 2009, the added challenge for the Government \nwill be to ensure predictability in its gross financing needs for 2009. In the medium term, the \nGovernment needs to ensure it sustains revenue sustainability to fund priority programs and \nlonger-term debt sustainability. The crisis also provides an opportunity for the Government to \nrevisit its balanced budget objective and to explore the feasibility of alternative fiscal rules that \ncould anchor fiscal policy (Appendix 4).  \n                                                 \n18 A fiscal expansion is defined as the change in the national government primary budget balance between 2 years.  \n19 ADB staff estimates of fiscal expansions in Southeast Asia: Cambodia (1.8% of GDP), Indonesia (2.4% of GDP); \nThailand (4.1% of GDP); and Viet Nam (3.8% of GDP). \n ", "  11\n \nFigure 3: Fiscal Performance \n     (a) National Government Deficit and Debt to GDP              (b) Output Gap and Fiscal Stance \n           (1996\u20132008)                                                                         (2003\u20132010) \nFiscal expansion\n6 90 2\n5 80 1\nNG Deficit  (LHS) NG Debt (RHS)\nP 4 70 DP 0\nD G 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\n G 3 %  P-1\nDeficit % 2 5600 G Debt  % GD-2\n1 N -3\n0 40 fiscal consolidation period\n-4\n1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n-1 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 30\n5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 -5\nFiscal contraction\nNG Deficit NG Debt Output Gap Fiscal Stance\n     \nGDP = gross domestic product, LHS = left hand side, NG = national government, RHS = right hand side. \nNote: Fiscal stance calculated as the percentage point change in the primary budget deficit to GDP between two \nyears. A positive change reflects a fiscal expansion; a negative change reflects a fiscal contraction. A positive output \ngap reflects actual growth exceeding potential growth and vice versa (see Appendix 4 for calculations). In Figure 3(b) \nit is apparent the Government has been operating a fiscal contraction during the period of consolidation from 2003 to \n2007. A small fiscal expansion occurred in 2008. In 2009 the fiscal expansion is estimated at 2.3% of GDP and the \nnegative output gap is estimated at over 4% of GDP. \nSources: Bureau of Treasury, Department of Finance,  and ADB staff estimates. Figures for 2009 and 2010 \nprojections.  \n \n19.  Tax revenue performance. Tax collection (cash collections from the BIR and BOC) \ngrew by 11.0% in 2008 over 2007 levels. BIR cash collection was up 9.0% in 2008, short of its \ntarget of 13.5% as collections in the fourth quarter significantly slowed and actually declined in \nDecember  (Figure  4).  Substantial  improvements  in  collections  were  made  in  some  taxes: \ncorporate income tax collection increased by 18.3% over 2007 levels and excise tax collections \non  tobacco  products  were  also  better  by  18.8%.  Value-added  collections  under  the  BIR's \njurisdiction fell by 3.2% over 2007 levels. Poor compliance with value-added tax (VAT) appears \nto occur in the services sector, especially in retail and trade, which comprise a large number of \nsmaller taxpayers. Continued weak tax administration and inefficiencies in the tax policy indicate \nthat the BIR has been unable to lift VAT collections through improvements in tax efficiency and \nenforcement. The prevalence of VAT exemptions (resulting in breaks in the VAT chain and \nthereby  weaker  self-compliance),  and  generous  taxable  income  deductions  in  the  growth \nsectors of the economy continue to limit growth-induced tax collection. In the first semester of \n2009, tax collection fell by 5.2% over levels in the same period in 2008, reflecting the economic \ncontraction in the Philippines. Customs collections fell 8.3% (VAT on imported goods fell 12.9%) \nand the BIR's collections fell by 5.1% on a year-on-year basis. ADB assessments indicate that \ntax revenues in the Philippines have historically exhibited a systematic, moderate procyclical \npattern, i.e., during periods of fast economic growth direct and indirect taxes grow faster than \nnominal GDP, and during sharp slowdowns, taxes fall faster than nominal GDP. ADB estimates \nthat, based on a low-growth scenario for 2009 and 2010, the tax to GDP ratio will decline for \n2009 and some of the decline will carry over into 2010 (Appendix 4).   \n ", "12    \n \n \n       Figure 4: Bureau of Internal Revenue Tax Collection \n     (a) Tax Collection                                (b) Tax Collection by Major BIR Tax Category \n           (Quarterly growth, year-on-year)                                           (% growth change in 2008 over 2007) \n25\n25\n20\n20\n15\n15\n10 10\n5 5\n0 0\n-1-50 Q1 2006 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2007 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2008 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2009 -1-05 income taxCorporate income taxIndividual DepositsBank (tobacco)Excise tax (other)Excise tax added taxValue taxPercentage Other taxes All\n   \nBIR = Bureau of Internal Revenue. \nSources: Bureau of Treasury, Department of Finance. http://www.treasury.gov.ph. \n \n20.  Sustaining priority spending. The Government is targeting an increase in the rate of \nnoninterest expenditure to GDP from 12.2% in 2006 to 14% by 2010. Ensuring priority spending \nis sustainable within the budget framework over the medium term will require further effort to \nraise tax revenues. This remains a long-term challenge for the Government. Its approach is \nthreefold: (i) to implement its tax administration reforms; (ii) to enhance and institutionalize the \nanticorruption initiatives in the BIR and the BOC; and (iii) to improve tax policies. The BIR has a \ncomprehensive tax administration reform program up to 2010, but implementation has been \ndelayed  and  is  proceeding  more  slowly  than  initially  expected.  This  is  partly  due  to  the \ncomplexity of the reform program and the fact that the BIR\u2019s budgetary resources for long-term \nreforms have been critically constrained. Staff resistance, vested interests, and corruption have \nalso contributed to the slow start to reform as it is rolled out to the regional tax offices. The \nGovernment must address longer-term resource constraints at the BIR, including raising its \npersonnel budget. Gradual and incremental reforms have been made to tax administration. A \ndraft bill has been submitted to Congress to allow the BIR to set salaries for its staff closer to \nmarket values. Through the 2009 national government  budget, the DBM has allocated an \nadditional P1.0 billion in funds to the BIR to hire up to 3,000 new technical staff nationwide. The \nBIR has made it a priority to institutionalize its anticorruption revenue program, Run After Tax \nEvaders (RATE), as lessons from subprogram 2 of the DPSP indicate that it is necessary to \ninstitutionalize these initiatives within the agencies to ensure they are sustainable and constitute \nan effective deterrent to tax evasion. ADB is providing TA to the BIR, the Department of Finance \n(DOF), and the Department of Justice to strengthen revenue-enhancing measures, enforcement, \nand prosecution of tax evaders. \n \n21.  Several tax policies have weaknesses in design and structure that limit tax revenue \ngrowth. Under the 2005 amendments to excise tax legislation, the DOF has been delegated \nauthority to raise specific taxes until 2011. It raised excise tax on tobacco and alcohol in 2007 \nand again in January 2009. However, the excise tax legislation has too many bands that allow \n ", "  13\nproducers to minimize tax liabilities and it is not indexed to inflation. At the end of 2007, the DOF \nsubmitted to Congress a revised investment incentives bill. Deliberations have progressed in \nCongress but have recently slowed with the upcoming presidential elections next year. The \nGovernment will need to issue implementing rules and regulations to rationalize investment \nincentives  once  Congress  passes  the  bill.  However,  tax  exemption  legislation  initiated  by \nCongress has also eroded the tax base.   \n \n22.  Debt management. Improvements made in public debt management since 2005 have \nresulted in significant fiscal savings. Overall, debt interest costs in the national government \nbudget have fallen from 36.7% of total national government revenues in 2005 to 22.6% in 2008, \nfreeing up substantial resources for priority programs. This was partly because of specific debt \nmanagement measures, such as lengthening the average maturity of government debt to 7.1 \nyears and maintaining a diverse portfolio of obligations within a disciplined fiscal program. \nNevertheless, public debt at 56.0% of GDP and debt servicing costs (interest and amortization) \nat about 8.0% of GDP are relatively high by developing country standards. Much needs to be \ndone to improve the institutional framework for debt management. Debt management systems \nat the DOF are compartmentalized with separate units in the Bureau of Treasury, Corporate \nAffairs (covering contingent liabilities of government-owned and controlled corporations and \nothers), and the International Finance Group (covering official development assistance and \ninternational  commercial  borrowings).  Monitoring  of  contingent  liabilities  under  the  Build\u2013\noperate\u2013transfer law is done through the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) \ninvestment coordination committee (ICC). Consequently, debt management is not conducted \nwithin an integrated debt framework as suggested by best international practice. A medium-term \ndebt management and risk strategy and policies are needed.  \n \n2.  Governance in Public Financial Management  \n23.  Public  financial  management.  Implementing  improved  systems  for  public  financial \nmanagement,  including  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF),  and  aligning  the \nbudget planning process with strategic objectives and priorities is integral to improving public \nfinancial  management  efficiency,  and  therefore  sustainable  priority  spending.  Progress \ncontinues to be made. The DBM continues to increase the use of the MTEF in preparing the \n2009 and 2010 budgets, including preparing budget strategy papers and disseminating forward \nestimates for 3 years with the increasing involvement of all 22 departments in formulating the \nforward estimates. In 2007, the organizational performance indicator framework (OPIF) that \nlinks budget allocations to management performance indicators was rolled out to all national \ngovernment line departments, four constitutional offices, and state colleges and universities. \nThe  DBM  has  started  to  pilot  internal  control  systems  in  selected  line  ministries.  The \nGovernment, ADB, and other development partners have identified several core areas to be \naddressed, beginning with budget preparation through to budget execution and reporting, which \nwill require a much longer-term, coordinated effort in capacity development (paras. 24\u201328).  \n  \n24.  Budget preparation and credibility. A multiyear perspective in fiscal planning and \nbudgeting needs to be strengthened. Key to this is completing the rollout of the MTEF to line \nministries and continuing to involve them in computing the forward estimates needed to ensure \nthe MTEF is institutionalized within the Government. While much progress has been made in \nthis area, more needs to be done. In particular, currently the DBM sets forward estimates at a \ndisaggregated level of spending, which tends to create rigidities in resource allocation within a \ndepartment. Over the longer term, the DBM should set the forward estimates for the budget of \nthe department and provide the department with flexibility to determine resource allocation \nacross priorities. Often in-year reallocations of the approved budget between line agencies \n ", "14    \n \nundermine the credibility of the budget composition, defined as the extent to which the budget is \nrealistic and is implemented as intended. Public access to key fiscal information in the budget \ndocuments  needs  to  be  improved,  including  presentation  of  budget  documents  for  public \nconsumption. Finally, revenue forecasts for budget preparation are often ambitious, in part \nbecause  of  weaknesses  in  forecasting capabilities  at  DOF  and  its  revenue  agencies.  The \nbudget presentation is not accompanied by debt risk and sustainability assessments. \n \n25.  Budget  execution  and  controls.  There  are  weaknesses  in  the  recording  and \nmanagement of cash balances, as having more than one treasury account makes reconciling \nbalances difficult. The monthly (and even daily) cash forecasting capabilities of the Bureau of \nTreasury need to be strengthened to improve the predictability of the availability of funds for \nexpenditures  during  the  budget  cycle.  The  DBM  retains  excessive  controls  over  spending \ncommitments and cash disbursements and the practice of quarterly cash releases (instead of \nsemiannual) elevates the unpredictability of funding and leads to excessive agency \u201csavings\u201d at \nthe end of the year. The central departments have limited authority over the spending agencies \nunder them. Current reporting arrangements make it difficult to reconcile the budget allocation \nreleases  and  the  actual  expenditures  incurred  by  agencies  because  of  differences  in  the \naccounting formats used by the DBM and the chart of accounts used by the Commission of \nAudit (COA). \n \n       Figure 5: Public Financial Performance Indicators \n  (a) Absorptive Capacity Rates                              (b) Utilization Ratio  \n       (ratio of total obligation to total allotment)                                  (ratio of disbursements to cash releases) \n100 100\n90 90\n80 80\n70 70\n60 60\n50 50\nDPWH DOTC DA DepEd All NG DPWH DOTC DA DepEd All NG\n       \nDA = Department of Agriculture, DepEd = Department of Education, DOTC = Department of Transportation and \nCommunications, DPWH = Department of Public Works and Highways, All NG = average for all national government \ndepartments and agencies. \nSource: Department of Budget and Management. \n \n26.  These weaknesses in budget execution are reflected in the poor performance of key \npublic  financial  management  indicators,  such  as  the  low  absorptive  capacity  rates  of  key \nspending agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Public Works \nand  Highways  (DPWH),  the  Department  of  Transportation  and  Communications,  and  the \nDepartment of Education (DepEd)\u2014Figure 5. Given the Government plans to stimulate the \neconomy through timely, well-targeted and transparent programs, it will be important to lift these \nrates.  One  area  where  substantial  progress  has  been  made  is  procurement  reforms.  The \nGovernment  Procurement  Policy  Board  (GPPB)  continues  to  make  substantial  progress  in \nimplementing the Government Procurement Reform Act, 2003 and its 3-year action plan to \nstrengthen  the  institutional  framework,  capacity  building  of  procurement  officers,  and \nenforcement  of  the  law,  including  the  expansion  of  the  Philippine  government  electronic \n ", "  15\nprocurement  system  (PhilGEPS),  which  is  aimed  at  raising  transparency  and  enhancing \ncompetition in procurement.  \n \n27.  Internal controls system. Internal control and audit systems in spending agencies are \nan  essential  element  of  budget  execution  and  financial  reporting.  Internal  control  provides \nreasonable assurance that the systems, rules, and procedures of the organization will help \nachieve efficiency of operations, reliability in financial reporting, and compliance with applicable \nregulations.  Internal  audit  is  an  independent,  objective  activity  designed  to  add  value  and \nimprove  an  organization\u2019s  operations.  There  are  weaknesses  in  payroll  controls,  internal \ncontrols for nonsalary expenditures, and the lack of independent internal audits within line \nministries. Until recently, there were no generic guidelines for internal control systems for line \nagencies to follow and not all agencies have established independent internal audit units.  \n \n28.  Budget accounting, recording, and reporting. Accounts reconciliation and in-year \nbudget reports on obligations, cash releases and allotments, obligations, and disbursements are \nnot  done  on  time,  and  thus  do  not  track  progress  against  indicators  of  budget  efficiency \neffectively.  The  key  underlying  cause  of  weaknesses  in  budget  execution,  recording,  and \nreporting is the absence of an integrated government financial management information system \n(GFMIS). The current manual recording of accounts payable results in frequent reporting delays \nfrom line ministries and regions to DBM. The Government is developing the initial components \nof a GFMIS, including the eBudget (electronic releasing and programming of the budget), \neNGAS (electronic national accounting system), and PhilGEPS (electronic procurement system), \nbut these are fragmented and, except for the PhilGEPS, coverage is low. The Government pilot-\ntested the e-Budget system in the first quarter of 2008 before the rollout to regional offices. It will \nbe important for key agencies of COA, DBM, and DOF to establish a consensus on the way \nforward for integrating the fragmented GFMIS. This will require a formal coordinated effort by \nkey government agencies with longer-term support from development partners. The DBM has \nundertaken a study of government financial information systems and has begun consultations \nwith departments and stakeholders on ways to integrate them. Completing the design and \ndevelopment of the GFMIS over the medium term will be important to enhance the efficiency \nand effectiveness of services and to improve transparency. ADB technical assistance is being \nprovided to the DBM to support it to develop a GFMIS road map with clear targets. Monitoring \nthis reform is included in the post-program monitoring framework (para. 51). \n \n3.  Investment Climate \n29.  Investment  growth.  The  investment  expansion  that  began  in  2007  continued \nthroughout  the  first  half  of  2008  with  private  construction  growing  by  20%  and  durable \nequipment and machinery expanding by 6% on a year-on-year basis. Total fixed investment \nslowed to 4.3% in the second half of the year. Overall, the investment\u2013GDP ratio has increased \nfrom 14.0% of GDP in 2006 to 15.0% in 2008. Private investment has stagnated in 2009. The \nGovernment has increased public spending on infrastructure this year and this should lift the \ninvestment rate. However, ADB staff estimates suggest the Philippines is underinvesting by as \nmuch 5 percentage points of GDP and much needs to be done to put it on a sustainable growth \npath, such as improving the business regulatory climate, trade facilitation, and establishing a \ntransparent public\u2013private infrastructure investment policy framework.  \n ", "16    \n \n \nFigure 6: Investor Perceptions on the Philippine Investment Climate \n(average rating score) \n(a) Most Important Decision Factors to Investors            (b) Investors' Rating of the Philippines Compared to    \n     (1 is least important, 10 is most important)                       Neighboring Economies   (\u20135 is worst, 5 is best) \nAbove average\n8 2\n7 1.5\n6 1\n5 0.5\n4 0\n23 Macroeconom stabilityPolitical Skilled labor Incentives Labor cost Openness Law and orde Red tape utilitiesProvision of Corruption Legal system ---210--...52515 Skilled labor the economy Openness of Labor cost Incentives utilitiesProvision of Macroeconomy Legal system Law and order Red tape stabilityPolitical Corruption\ny r Below average\n                                 \nSource: ADB Investment Incentives Survey, 2008. The survey covered 357 firms operating in Metro Manila and the \nmain special economic zones. Investors were asked to rate each factor on a scale of 1\u201310.  \n  \n30.  Update  on  constraints  on  investment.  A  2009  report,  Philippines:  Reforming \nInvestment Incentives reiterated the key constraints on the investment attractiveness of the \nPhilippines relative to its neighbors. 20  These include excessive red tape, political instability, and \ncorruption. On the other hand, investors rated the Philippines above average on skilled labor \nand the cost of labor, openness of the economy, and generosity of tax incentives (Figure 6). \nMacroeconomic  performance,  considered  by  investors  to  be  the  most  important  factor \ninfluencing their investment decisions, was rated about average with the region. A 2007 report, \nPhilippines: Critical Development Constraints highlighted inadequate infrastructure as a major \nconstraint on private sector investment and growth. 21  The report also identified constraints that \nhave been a drag on investment and poverty reduction in the rural economy, including bad \nconnectivity between farmers and urban markets, poor rural road infrastructure, costly shipping, \nand inadequate logistics.  \n \n31.  Progress on business regulations. Encouraging progress is being made in improving \nthe  business  environment,  especially  at  the  LGU  level.  The  Doing  Business  2009 \nreportindicates the time and cost involved in launching a business in the Philippines in 2009 \nimproved from 2008 (down from 58 days to 52 days; regional average is 44 days), although the \nPhilippines' global ranking slipped four notches to 155 out of 181 countries.22 The national figure \nmasks considerable variations at the subnational level as the licensing and registration functions \nhave been devolved to LGUs. Recognizing this, the Doing Business 2009 report also looked at \nLGU performance. Metro Manila performed well by international standards. Based on best \npractices in the Philippines, it takes 27 days to launch a business in Taguig City (ranked 76th \nout of 178 economies);  it takes 58 days in Tanauan City to obtain construction permits (ranked \n6th  globally);  and  it  takes  21  days  in  Mandaluyong  City  to  register  property  (ranked  35th \nglobally). These performances reflect ongoing efforts by the central government and LGUs to \nintroduce best practices in regulatory and registration functions, including dissemination of the \n                                                 \n20 ADB.

The  National \nCompetitiveness  Council  has  drafted  a  framework  to  institutionalize  a  regulatory  impact \nassessment  (RIA)  within  government  and  to  guide  the  formulation  of  an  action  plan. \nInstitutionalizing  the  RIA  across  national  line  agencies  will  improve  transparency  in  the \nregulatory process. As a starting point, an oversight agency will need to be designated to \npromote the RIA and achieve broad agreement on the appropriate institutional arrangements. \nOne option would be to establish an office on best regulatory practice on the Australian model.   \n \n32.  Infrastructure. Trade facilitation costs (from factory to port) in the Philippines are high \ncompared with those in neighboring countries. The World Bank\u2019s logistics performance index \nranks the Philippines 65 out of 150 countries.23 A breakdown shows that costs related to \ninfrastructure (road, rail, and domestic shipping) account for these higher costs and the index \nranks the Philippines 86 on infrastructure. While public spending on infrastructure has gone up \nby more than 50% in the last 3 years, it still remains a little over half of its share in GDP in the \nmid-1990s.  Much  needs  to  be  done  to  encourage  private  companies  to  participate  in \ninfrastructure, including through public\u2013private partnerships, by reducing risks and uncertainty in \nthe policy and regulatory regime. Progress is being made, albeit gradually. The Government has \nissued guidelines clarifying rights and obligations in joint ventures between private and public \npartners in infrastructure investments and is standardizing procedures. However, the agenda is \nlarge  and  much  needs  to  be  done  to  provide  a  clearer  framework  for  government  risk \nguarantees and the monitoring of them. Over the medium term, the Government needs to \nestablish  a  public\u2013private  partnership  project  preparation  facility.  This  would  increase  the \nconfidence of private operators and financiers in government commitments. \n \n33.  Trade facilitation. The World Bank\u2019s logistics performance survey also highlights that \nthe Philippines could do more to improve performance in customs facilitation and transparency \n(it is ranked 53 out of 150 countries). Customs processes are lengthy and cumbersome and \nbusinesses  complain  about  a  lack  of  transparency.  In  all,  about  40  different  government \nagencies issue regulations or permits on exporting and importing goods. Customs has designed \na national single window that will allow exporters and importers to track containers and the \npermit approval process, thereby creating an arms-length and more transparent process in \nclearance. It has been piloting this national single window at the port of Batangas since March \n2009 and the single window needs to be rolled out to all major ports.  \n \n4.  Enhance Human Capital and Social Inclusion \n34.  In the current global environment, the Government faces both short- and long-term \nchallenges to its poverty reduction efforts. In the short term, the Government's priority is to \nmitigate the worst effects of the current global economic crisis on the poor. In the long term, it is \nto make progress on the MDGs and to expand coverage of targeted programs to the poor.  \n \n35.  Poverty impacts in the short term. The incidence of poverty is expected to rise in 2009. \nThe transition will initially be through job losses and reduced incomes in the industrial urban \ncenters, and is expected to spill over to the rural areas as the slowdown becomes more broadly \nbased. The expected slowdown in overseas deployment of Filipino workers will put pressure on \nthe labor market. Remittances are expected to fall, which will have an impact on poverty.  \n                                                 \n23  World Bank. 2007. Connecting to Compete: Trade Logistics Performance Index and Its Indicators. Washington, \nDC.  \n ", "18    \n \n36.  The core purpose of the fiscal expansion is to protect jobs and mitigate the worst effects \nof  the  global  crisis  on  poverty  reduction.  The  Government  has  scaled  up  several  poverty \nalleviation programs. Under the DPSP, the Government designed and pretested a conditional \ncash  transfer  program  (CCT  or  Pantawid  Pamilyang  Pilipino  Program)  covering  20,000 \nhouseholds  in  2007.  A  pilot  program  covered  337,345  households  in  2008  and  this  has \ncontinued into 2009, with the intention to scale it to 699,000. Each household receives P1,400 \nper month. However, as the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program is still in its pilot stage, it is \nunlikely to be scaled up sufficiently enough to mitigate the full poverty effects of the economic \nslowdown. Other programs that have been scaled up include the hunger mitigation program, \neducation scholarships, and the school feeding program. Through the 2009 national budget, \nsocial  expenditure  has  substantially  increased:  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and \nDevelopment (DSWD) budget has doubled in real terms (i.e., inflation-adjusted) compared with \nthe  2008  budget,  education  expenditure  has  increased  by  10%  in  real  terms,  and  health \nspending by 19% (Figure 7). The Government's Comprehensive Livelihood and Emergency \nEmployment  Program  (CLEEP)  is  designed  to  create  373,117  jobs  for  workers  who  may \notherwise fall into poverty. Implementation began at the end of 2008 with a budget allocation of \nP13.6 billion. By July 2009, 238,610 jobs had been created. \n \nFigure 7: Real Spending in the Social Sector  \n(P billion, adjusted for annual inflation; % share of national government budget) \n(a) Department of Health    (b) Department of Education      (c) Department of Social Welfare and  \n                                                                                                                            Development   \n20 160 10\n16 8\n120\n12 6\nn n n\nbillio billio80 billio\nP8 P P4\n40\n4 2\n0 0 0\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\n1.60% 1.40% 1.30% 1.90% 2.10% 15.5 14.0% 14.4% 14.9% 14.9% 0.3% 0.3% 0.4% 0.5% 0.9%\n                                 \nSources: Department of Budget and Management; various general budget appropriations, 2005\u20132009. \n \n37.  Rapid poverty monitoring. The Government does not have a poverty monitoring and \nresponse mechanism that can provide information about developments in household poverty \nsufficiently quickly to allow it to respond promptly with targeted poverty alleviation programs. To \nmitigate the effects of the economic slowdown, the Government will therefore need to establish \na poverty monitoring unit coordinated across relevant ministries. \n \n38.  Medium-term  social  protection.  The  Government's  medium-term  social  sector \npriorities are to make progress on the MDGs and to expand coverage of social protection \nprograms to the poor.  Fiscal austerity measures introduced from 2001 to 2006 to reduce the \nGovernment deficit disproportionately hurt social policy expenditures. This is one of the reasons \nthe Philippines is having difficulty in meeting some of its MDG targets, particularly those in \neducation and health. The Government is well aware of these problems and is committed to \n ", "  19\nimproving quality and access to basic education and health care, and to reversing recent \ndeclines in performance. The Government has been addressing resource constraints through \nsubstantial increases in real spending in the social sectors since 2007 (Figure 7). At the same \ntime, the Government has drafted proposals for a new needs-based formula for allocating \nschool funding on a more equitable basis. In the health sector, the Government continues to \nmake progress on its \"Fourmula One for Health\" implementation framework for health sector \nreforms in the medium term (2005\u20132010), including implementing its MTEF for better resource \nallocation  within  the  health  sector.  The  overall  goal  is  to  improve  the  quality,  efficiency, \neffectiveness, and equity of the health system, particularly for the poor. ADB's Health Sector \nDevelopment Program offers one example of how systematic provincial public expenditure \nreviews and the use of programmatic initiatives can help effect improvements to local service \ndelivery. 24 \n \n39.  The  Government  has  a  wide  range  of  social  protection  programs,  including  health \ninsurance,  education  scholarships  for  the  poor,  school  feeding  programs,  subsidized  rice \nthrough  the  National  Food  Authority,  public  employment  programs  and  the  community \ndevelopment program known as the Kalahi program. However, these are fragmented and the \noverall results in terms of net welfare to recipient groups are mixed. An ADB study on social \nprotection coverage shows that such programs only cover one-third of the poor compared with \nan average of one-half of the poor in Southeast Asia and East Asia. The Government is looking \nat ways to enhance social protection coverage of the poor. Under subprogram 2, the National \nEconomic  and  Development  Authority  (NEDA)  issued  Social  Development  Committee \nResolution No. 1 on adopting a Philippine definition of social protection. With the aim of refining \ntargeted programs under the new definition, the DSWD is implementing the CCT program, and \nthe Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and relevant agencies are implementing \nCLEEP.  \n \nC.  Lessons \n40.  In the process of assessing implementation progress on the triggers for subprogram 3 \n(Appendix 6), several lessons were identified and used to formulate subprogram 3.  \n(i)  The Government's fiscal consolidation since 2005 has given it the fiscal space it \nneeds to respond to the current crisis and to expand its deficit to 3.2% in 2009. \n(ii)  The  program  cluster  approach  with  triggers  contains  sufficient  flexibility  to \nrespond  to  lessons  identified  during  implementation  and  to  incorporate  new \ngovernment policy priorities, such as measures to mitigate the economic impact \nof the current crisis and to protect critical public expenditure (para. 56). \n(iii)  Subprogram 3 is the final subprogram of the program cluster, but it is essential \nthat policy dialogue and engagement should continue during the period leading \nup to the formation of a new government after the presidential election in May \n2010.  The  program  cluster  approach  provides  a  post-program  monitoring \nframework (para. 66 and Appendix 2, Policy Matrix). Ongoing TA support on tax \nadministration,  public  financial  management,  and  the  investment  climate  will \ncontinue during the post-program monitoring period.  \n \n41.  As a result, subprogram 3 incorporates several important new policy features to support \nthe Government\u2019s efforts to mitigate the adverse impact of the global crisis on macroeconomic \nstability and poverty.  \n                                                 \n24  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the \nRepublic of the Philippines for the Health Sector Development Program. Manila. \n ", "20    \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n42.  The impact of the subprogram 3 will be to restore the Philippines' economic expansion to \nits long-term path and to lower unemployment. The outcome of subprogram 3 will be greater \ninvestment, achieved through a set of program outputs to improve fiscal sustainability (through \nlower budget deficits, greater tax efforts, and better public debt management); enhance public \nfinancial management (through better reporting mechanisms, more efficient and transparent \nprocurement systems, and stronger anticorruption programs in the revenue agencies); make the \ninvestment  climate  more  attractive  (through  lower  business  transaction  costs  and  better \ncoordination of public\u2013private participation in infrastructure); and strengthen human capital and \nsocial inclusion (through better poverty targeting and monitoring of assistance).  \n \n43.  The DPSP cluster includes a series of policy reforms that underpin the key priorities of \nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda. Subprogram 3 also includes a series of policy measures that \naddress  the  increased  vulnerabilities  and  risks  to  the  Philippine  economy  from  the  global \nfinancial crisis and the sharp slowdown in the global economy. These reforms are designed to:  \n(i)  improve  fiscal  sustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability,  and  improve \ncreditworthiness by enhancing the quality of fiscal management by (a) increasing \ntax revenues for 2008\u20132009 through tax policy reforms; (b) strengthening tax \nadministration and enforcement, and reducing revenue leaks through improved \ngovernance;  (c)  reducing  inefficient  spending  to  permit  increased  social  and \npoverty-related spending; (d) strengthening the debt management strategy to \nmanage  government  contingent  liabilities  and  risks  prudently  and  (e)  giving \ndepositors' confidence in the domestic banking system; \n(ii)  enhance  public  financial  management    governance  by  (a)  improving  public \nfinancial management  from budget preparation through to budget execution, \naccounting,  recording,  and  reporting;  (b)  strengthening  performance \nmanagement and improving public service delivery; (c) reforming procurement; \n(d)  implementing  anticorruption  and  enforcement  strategies  for  revenue-\ncollecting agencies and key procurement agencies; and (e) sustaining critical \npublic expenditures while maintaining budget discipline to mitigate the poverty \nimpacts of the deceleration in growth; \n(iii)  improve  the  investment  climate  and  promote  rural  development  by  \n(a)  clarifying  and  strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for \ninvestments and trade, (b) facilitating infrastructure development through greater \npublic\u2013private  participation  and  greater  coordination  of  public  infrastructure \ninvestments, and (c) improving rural\u2013urban connectivity; and  \n(iv)  enhance human capital and social inclusion by improving the policy framework \nfor social protection, sustaining real spending on health and education, improving \ntargeting of programs, improving service delivery, piloting the CCT program tied \nto  performance  outcomes  in  child  education  and  health,  refining  public \nemployment  programs,  and  establishing  a  national  poverty  monitoring  and \nresponse  system  to  help  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  economic  slowdown  on \npoverty. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n \n44.  The  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  for  subprogram  2  of  the  DPSP \nidentified  13  policy  triggers  for  subprogram  3  (footnote  1).  In  the  process  of  assessing \n ", "  21\nimplementation progress, the Government proposed three additional triggers and measures \naimed at addressing the increased vulnerabilities and risks to the Philippine economy from the \nglobal financial crisis and the sharp slowdown in progress on poverty reduction (Appendix 6 \nprovides an assessment of subprogram 3 triggers): \n(i)  Increase in bank deposit insurance. The Government is making every effort to \nmaintain macroeconomic stability in the current adverse global financial turmoil. \nOne  lesson  from  the  1997\u20131998  financial  crisis  was  that  the  absence  of  a \ncredible deposit insurance scheme can exacerbate the loss of confidence in the \nbanking sector and lead to a run on the banks. The Government has therefore \nincreased the ceiling for deposit insurance from P250,000 to P500,000. \n(ii)  Speed up budget disbursements. Based on experience, disbursement rates for \npublic spending are relatively low in the first quarter of each fiscal year (75%\u2013\n80% at key spending agencies). The procurement process is also slow to start as \nline agencies do not begin until allotments (giving the authority to obligate) are \nreleased by the DBM. The Government has therefore proposed a new trigger on \nactions  to  speed  up  disbursements  and  advance  procurement  without \nundermining recent gains in procurement governance. \n(iii)  Establish poverty monitoring and reporting mechanism. The Government \nhas recommended adding a new trigger on establishing a poverty monitoring and \nreporting  system  mechanism.  It  is  concerned  about  the  need  for  a  prompt \nresponse  to  increased  poverty  as  a  result  of  the  crisis.    The  focus  of  this \ninitiative\u2014to measure poverty impacts\u2014will be on collecting real-time data on \nemployment  and  dismissals,  wage  data,  farmers\u2019  incomes,  prices  of  basic \ncommodities, health, education, and social welfare.  \n \n45.  In total, the Government and ADB are focusing on 16 policy triggers (Appendix 2, policy \nmatrix). Most are supported by 17 measures to outline a blueprint for government implementing \nagencies to follow and execute, while a few measures have clear outputs (e.g., establish a unit, \nproduce an action plan, or carry out capacity building and training programs). The Government \nhas made substantial progress in completing these measures. Of the 16 triggers, it has fully or \nsubstantially accomplished 13. One has been partially accomplished, and implementation of the \nremaining two is ongoing. The Government is committed to completing these two remaining \ntriggers during the post-program monitoring period. All of the 17 other supporting (nontrigger) \nmeasures have been completed.  \n \n46.  Progress toward the DPSP performance indicators and targets set out in the design and \nmonitoring framework for subprogram 1 and updated for subprogram 3 (Appendix 1, column 3) \nhas been substantial, although the global financial crisis has set back progress on some of the \ntargets.  Of  the  25  performance  indicators  and  targets,  four  have  been  achieved:  (i)  two \nsovereign credit upgrades by Standard & Poor\u2019s since 2006, (ii) a consolidated public sector \nbudget surplus since 2006, (iii) computerization of revenue district offices under the BIR's tax \nadministration program, and (iv) rollout of the OPIF to national agencies and four constitutional \nbodies. Twelve are on track to achieve medium-term targets, four have slowed, four have \nregressed from their medium-term paths or baselines, and the remaining indictor is a new one. \nProgress  on  the  following  indicators  has  slowed  or  regressed:  economic  growth,  the \nunemployment rate, and fixed capital investment (primarily due to the global financial crisis and \nrecession), tax collections as a share of GDP, and elementary school enrollments and survival \ncohort rates. The national government balanced budget target has been delayed from 2009 to \n2013 as a consequence of the global crisis.  \n \n ", "22    \n \n47.  In the spirit of the DPSP cluster, which aims to support the Government\u2019s policy reform \nagenda  on  a  continuing  basis  rather  than  through  predetermined  rigid  conditions,  the \nGovernment  has  asked  ADB  to  recognize  the  substantial  progress  that  has  been  made. \nFurthermore, as individual loans under the DPSP cluster are sequenced to provide continuous \nand  predictable  support,  and  subprogram  3  is  the  final  subprogram  of  this  cluster,  the \nGovernment has asked ADB and its development partners to remain fully engaged as part of \nthe ongoing dialogue, to support and continuously monitor implementation and completion of \nthe  remaining  policy  triggers,  to  provide  longer-term  TA  to  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement  capacity, and to support implementation of the post-DPSP program monitoring \nframework. ADB\u2019s program cluster approach provides for such flexibility in reform programs that \nare implemented over time, by taking emerging circumstances into account. \n \n1.  Accomplishments under Subprogram 3 \n48.  Subprogram 3 focuses on four of the seven core policy areas outlined by the Philippines \nDevelopment Forum (PDF): (i) improve fiscal sustainability, maintain macroeconomic stability, \nand improve creditworthiness; (ii) improve governance in public financial management and \nreduce  corruption;  (iii)  strengthen  the  investment  climate  and  rural  development;  and  (iv) \nenhance human capital and social inclusion.  \n \na.  Improve Fiscal Sustainability, Maintain Macroeconomic Stability, \nand Improve Creditworthiness \n49.  Fiscal discipline. The Government\u2019s immediate objectives are to protect critical public \nspending within a disciplined fiscal framework and to reduce nonfinancial public sector debt to \n65% of GDP by 2010. In 2008, (i) the national government deficit came in at 0.9% of GDP, the \nthird  consecutive  year  it  has  been  below  1%,  and  a  consolidated  public  sector  surplus \nsurpassed program expectations; and (ii) nonfinancial sector public debt fell from 87% of GDP \nin 2005 to 60% in 2008, and is on track to return to debt levels of the early 1990s. The national \ngovernment debt decreased from 72% in 2005 to 56% by the end of 2008. \n \n50.  Tax revenue sustainability. Tax revenues increased by 11% in 2008. Major gains were \nachieved in corporate income tax collection (18%) and tobacco excise (19%). VAT collections \nfell by 3% in 2008 due to weak compliance in the services sector. During subprogram 3 the \nGovernment  initiated  medium-term  actions  to  improve  revenue  sustainability,  including  \nraising the excise tax rate in January 2009 in line with existing legislation. The DOF has \nsubmitted a bill to Congress to reform excise taxes, including indexing specific rates to inflation \nand reducing the number of tax bands to two. While tax administration reforms were slow to \nbegin,  some  progress  has  been  made:  (i)  the  BIR,  with  assistance  from  USAID  and  the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), computerized 71 revenue district offices (97% of the \nuncomputerized offices) so that tax information can be provided online to the central office in \nManila; (ii) the backlog of tax registrations and returns has been reduced, with 348,465 tax \nregistrations and 1,235,889 income tax returns encoded and filed with assistance from the \nUSAID and MCC grant; and (iii) some progress was made in validating about 47% of the \nunregistered corporations (about 9,429 registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission) \nand inactive taxpayers in the database (162,352 taxpayers) identified under subprogram 2. The \nrevenue district offices are continuing to validate the identified taxpayers. \n \n51.  Debt management. In June 2009, the DOF issued a department order establishing a \ndebt and risk management division (DRMD). The DRMD will oversee debt policy and strategy, \ncarry out analysis, produce debt indicators, and undertake debt sustainability assessments. The \n ", "  23\ndepartment order was issued subject to the DBM's approval of the DOF's rationalization plan, \nwhich is expected later in 2009. Implementation of the order is ongoing and is included in the \npost-program monitoring framework (para. 66). ADB technical assistance will be provided to \nsupport capacity development of the DRMD (Appendix 8). Monitoring of contingent liabilities in \npublic\u2013private infrastructure projects will be shifted from the investment coordination committee \n(ICC) to the DRMD. With assistance from AusAID, the DOF updated the contingent liabilities \nrelated  to  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  infrastructure  under  the  BOT  Law.  It  also  made \nrecommendations on monitoring contingent liabilities and submitted them to the ICC.  \n \n52.  Deposit insurance. The Government introduced preemptive measures to protect the \neconomy. A key measure under subprogram 3 was raising the deposit insurance to P500,000 to \nboost depositors' confidence in the domestic banking system and to bring the ceiling into line \nwith those in neighboring countries.  \n \n53.  Impact  and  outcomes  of  subprogram  3. By the end of 2009, it is expected that \nsubprogram 3 will have helped to stabilize macroeconomic fundamentals and to prepare the \neconomy for a return to growth. The fiscal consolidation from 2005 to 2008 was a major \nachievement and created fiscal space for the Government to mitigate some of the impacts on \nthe economy and poverty in 2009 and 2010 arising from the global financial crisis. Fiscal \nsustainability will be maintained, as reflected in the country's sustainable debt levels and the \nGovernment's medium-term fiscal program, which targets lower budget deficits for 2011 and \n2012.  \n \nb.  Enhance Governance in Public Financial Management and Reduce \nCorruption \n54.  Medium-term expenditure framework. The DBM continues to make gradual progress \nin  improving  the  budget  preparation  process  and  transparency  in  budget  execution.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  immediate  objectives  are  to  implement  the  MTEF  and  OPIF,  improve \ntransparency in budget planning and execution, and strengthen internal control systems based \non good international practice. The DBM continued to refine and expand the medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  (MTEF)  for  the  2009  budget  and  the  2010  budget  preparations.  It \nupdated and produced forward estimates for a 3-year rolling period for all 22 line ministries and \nattached agencies and issued these as indicative budget ceilings for the 2010 budget. The \nGovernment also continued to strengthen public sector performance management through more \naggressive  implementation  of  the  performance-based  budgeting  process  by  the  DBM  and \ncompleting the adoption of the OPIF. The DBM completed the rollout of the OPIF to four \nconstitutional  offices\u2014(i)  Civil  Service  Commission,  (ii)  Commission  on  Elections, \n(iii) Commission on Audit (COA), and (iv) the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB)\u2014and state \nuniversities and colleges for the 2009 budget. \n \n55.  Transparency in budget execution. The DBM has made gradual progress in improving \ntransparency in the budget through the following key measures in 2008 and 2009. First, a key \nunderlying cause of weaknesses in budget execution, recording, and reporting is the absence of \nan integrated government financial management information system (GFMIS). The Government \nhas taken initial steps toward achieving consensus among stakeholders on the design and \ndevelopment of an integrated GFMIS and the DBM, with assistance from the US Trade and \nDevelopment Agency, has completed a study of the scope and requirements of an integrated \nGFMIS. Second, the Government has begun reforms to strengthen internal control and internal \naudit within government agencies. Guidelines for internal control systems have been printed for \ndissemination  to  agencies,  GOCCs,  and  LGUs.  The  DBM,  with  technical  assistance  from \n ", "24    \n \nAusAID, started piloting the internal control systems guidelines in two key spending agencies \n(DPWH and DepEd) in the fourth quarter of 2008. ADB and AusAID will support the piloting of \ninternal control systems in an additional set of agencies in 2009. \n \n56.  Measures  to  sustain  critical  public  spending.  Subprogram  3  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis on poverty. The DBM \nhas implemented a number of measures to expedite budget disbursements, including (i) the \nissuance of a DBM circular letter25 shifting cash releases to a 6-month cash release basis and \nrequiring line ministries to spend each month\u2019s cash allocation or lose it; (ii) a Government \nProcurement Policy Board (GPPB) circular to line ministries clarified that ministries can start the \nprocurement process before receiving allotments from DBM (authority to obligate the budget) \nbut the signing of contracts will require receipt of these allotments. \n \n57.  Procurement. The following measures were undertaken in 2008 and 2009 to improve \ntransparency and efficiency in public procurement. First, PhilGEPS, the electronic procurement \nsystem, completed its second year of full operation and major progress was made in increasing \ncompliance with the 2003 law on procurement. By the end of 2008, all 12 GPPB member \nagencies were posting bid opportunities and award notices, compared with nine in 2007. The \nGPPB made also progress in expanding outreach to non-GPPB members with the Department \nof Agriculture, the DSWD, the DENR, and the BIR all posting bid notices and awards on \nPhilGEPS in 2008. ADB TA is helping to enhance PhilGEPS outreach to agencies and civil \nsociety organizations.26 Second, the Procurement Transparency Group, with the Government \nand major civil society organizations (CSOs) as members, began operations under subprogram \n3. The group began tracking the procurement of selected infrastructure projects from the time \nthe bid notice is posted to selection of the winning bid. 27 Regular updates on procurement \nmonitoring are posted on the group\u2019s website.28 If discrepancies are identified in the bid and \nawards process, the group notifies the bids and awards committee and stakeholders to resolve \nany transparency concerns that may arise. Third, to enhance transparency, the group issued \nimplementing guidelines pursuant to its authority under Presidential Executive Order 662 (which \nestablished the group under subprogram 2). The guidelines require all government agencies to \npost annual procurement plans, procurement monitoring reports on activities specified in the \nannual procurement plans, and blacklisting and delisting orders on the GPPB website.   \n \n58.  Expenditure  integrity.  Subprogram  3  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce \nrevenue leakage by institutionalizing its anticorruption and collusion initiatives within agencies. \nExamples include the Run After Tax Evaders (RATE) program at the BIR and the Run After the \nSmugglers (RATS) program at the BOC. In July 2009 the DBM approved BIR's rationalization \nplan to transform the Enforcement Service to an Enforcement and Advocacy Service (EAS) \nunder the Legal Division\u2014a major achievement in strengthening enforcement capabilities at the \nBIR. The EAS has four divisions, one of which, the Special Prosecution Division (SPD), handles \nprosecution of RATE cases. The SPD will have 23 positions, and it is intended that most of the \nlitigation lawyers initially assigned to the RATE program with MCC assistance will be transferred \nto  the  SPD.  In  anticipation  of  the  approval  of  the  rationalization  plan,  the  2009  national \n                                                 \n25  No. 2008-11, December 2008. \n26 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Strengthening the Philippine Government \nElectronic Procurement System. Manila. \n27 The group established under subprogram 2 comprises representatives from GPPB, key procurement agencies, and \nsix CSOs nominated by the CSO Forum\u2014a voluntary gathering of major CSOs. The six CSOs are (i) the Bishops\u2013\nBusinessmen Conference, (ii) Makati Business Club, (iii) Transparency and Accountability Network, (iv) Ateneo \nGovernment Watch, (v) Confederation of Filipino Consultants, and (vi) Procurement Watch. \n28 Procurement Transparency Group. http://procurementtransparencygroup.wordpress.com. \n ", "  25\ngovernment  budget  has  allocated  an  additional  P1.0  billion  to  the  BIR  for  new  technical \npositions; approximately 3,000 new positions nationwide will be funded under this additional \nbudget.  To establish the credibility of the EAS, it must now successfully prosecute some of the \nmore than 120 RATE cases filed with the Department of Justice. Encouraging progress was \nmade when the BIR successfully prosecuted two tax fraud cases under the RATE program in \nJune 2009.  \n \n59.     The BOC has also made progress in institutionalizing its RATS program. The DBM has \napproved the creation of positions for the 36 previously contracted lawyers under the initiative. \nThe BOC continues to make progress in implementing its action plan (2008\u20132012), which was \ndeveloped through the OMB integrity development review process. This examines an agency's \npractices  and  procedures  to  assess  their  vulnerability  to  corruption.  The  OMB  has  placed \nresident officers in the BOC to help implement an action plan on a voluntary basis, as buy-in \nfrom the department is considered necessary for successful implementation. In addition, an \nintegrity  development  committee  at  the  BOC  has  been  established  to  monitor  the \nimplementation of the action plan.  \n \n60.  Impact and outcomes of subprogram 3. By the end of 2009, the DPSP is expected to \nhave  improved  the  budget  allocation  of  resources  and  to  have  linked  the  medium-term \ndevelopment plan and/or priorities of national departments with the budget process (via the \nMTEF). More departments will have an MTEF, and the rollout of the OPIF to four constitutional \nbodies and 112 state universities and colleges will have been completed. By the end of 2009, \nthe number of line agencies complying with the procurement reform law and transparency \nconditions such as PhilGEPs will have increased. The anticorruption revenue programs in the \nBIR and BOC will have been institutionalized to ensure they are sustainable.  \n \nc.  Improve the Investment Climate  \n61.  Investment climate reforms. The Government\u2019s main objective is to increase the share \nof investment and infrastructure spending in GDP. Critical reform areas under the DPSP include \n(i)  clarifying  and  strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  investments, \n(ii) improving trade facilitation, (iii) facilitating infrastructure development, and (iv) promoting \nrural  development  through  a  better  investment  climate.  Subprogram  3  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to reduce business transaction costs in 2008 and 2009. A memorandum \norder was submitted to the President's Office for approval in July 2009. This mandates NEDA to \nbegin advocating the regulatory impact assessment (RIA) and to develop an action plan for its \ninstitutionalization. The DTI has continued improvements in business registration by developing \nthe first phase of the Philippine business registry for sole proprietors online. Phase 2 covering \npartnerships and corporations involving the Securities Exchange Commission is expected to \nbegin in 2009. The Government and members of the PDF held a strategic agribusiness planning \nworkshop  in  March  2009.  This  discussed  the  formulation  of  a  strategic  agribusiness \ndevelopment  plan  and  the  bottlenecks  in  agriculture,  including  production,  post-production, \nmarketing  and  distribution  and  financing sectors.  A  first draft  of  the  strategic  agribusiness \ndevelopment plan has subsequently been drafted. \n \n62.  Trade facilitation and infrastructure policy. To enhance transparency and lower trade \nfacilitation costs, the Bureau of Customs worked with 21 agencies that issue import permits to \nput in place a national single window. The \"e2m Customs Systems Project\", of which the \nnational single window is a component, has been piloted at the port of Batangas and the BOC \nhas also implemented an import assessment system under the e2m Customs Systems Project. \nThe Government has submitted to the Senate for concurrence the instrument of accession to \n ", "26    \n \nthe Revised Kyoto Convention, which would promote greater transparency and efficiency in \ncustoms facilitation. In infrastructure policy, the medium-term objective is to establish a public\u2013\nprivate infrastructure partnership project preparation facility. In the interim, the Government \nissued a set of guidelines to govern joint ventures between government and private sector \nentities;  it  is  currently  drafting  a  set  of  standard  transaction  documents  for  public\u2013private \npartnerships; and preparing options for a strategy for the Government\u2019s risk assessment and \nmanagement, particularly for infrastructure projects approved by the investment coordination \ncommittee (ICC). \n \n63.  Impact and outcomes of subprogram 3. By the end of 2009, the DPSP-supported \nprogram is expected to have improved the Philippine investment climate. The investment\u2013GDP \nratio is expected to have increased from 14% of GDP in 2006 to 15% by 2009 and the share of \npublic investment in GDP to have increased by 1\u20132 percentage points. This progress will be \nachieved by reducing the transaction costs of doing business (as reflected in reduced number of \ndays to start up a business). \n \nd.  Enhance Human Capital and Social Inclusion \n64.  The  DPSP  supports  the  Government\u2019s  agenda  to  improve  the  social  sectors  by \nincreasing funding, improving governance in the budget process and procurement, engaging \ncivil society in monitoring procurement, and improving targeting of poverty reduction programs. \nIn 2008, the DSWD scaled up the CCT program to cover 337,345 households. Each receives \nP1,400 per month per household based on conditions related to child education and health, and \nprenatal and post-natal health care for pregnant women. The technical committee on poverty \nstatistics of the National Statistical Coordination Board (under NEDA) produced a draft poverty \nmonitoring mechanism to provide timely data and assessments of the impact of the economic \nslowdown and other external shocks on the poor that would allow the authorities to respond \npromptly. The NSCB is expected to approve it in the third quarter of 2009 and implementation \nwill follow. To mitigate some of the worst effects of the crisis on the poor, Presidential Executive \nOrder 782 earmarked 1.5% of ministries' maintenance expenditure for new hiring of displaced \nworkers accredited with DOLE on temporary contracts of up to 6 months.  \n \n65.   Impact and outcomes of subprogram 3. By the end of 2009, the DPSP will have \nimproved systems for poverty monitoring and reporting. The CCT program has been scaled up \nto 337,345 families, potentially making a significant dent in poverty.  \n \n2.  Post-Program Monitoring Framework \n66.  The development policy letter sets out the Government reform agenda for the next  \n1\u20132 years, building on the reform momentum of the DPSP. The Government of the Philippines, \nADB, and the Government of Japan have agreed to a post-program monitoring framework for \n12 months focusing on 11 core policy measures of the Government's short-term plan fiscal \nreform policy, public financial management, and selected areas in investment climate (Table 2 \nand Appendix 2). Monitoring arrangements are discussed in paras. 70 and 78. Ongoing ADB \ntechnical  assistance,  including  the  proposed  public  financial  management  TA,  will  support \nimplementation of selected measures in the action plan (Appendix 9).  \n \n ", "  27\nTable 2: Post-Program Monitoring Framework \nFiscal Policy and  Investment Climate and \nMacroeconomic Stability  Public Financial Management  Poverty Reduction \n1.

Financing Plan \n \n67.  The Government has requested a loan of $250,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to finance subprogram 3. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank-offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft \nprogram loan agreement presented to the Board. The Government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n68.  The ADB funds are to support reforms outlined in the development policy letter and \npolicy matrix (Appendix 2). The loan size was determined by the strength of the policy package, \nits  development  impact,  the  importance  of  the  sectors  covered,  adjustment  costs,  direct \nbudgetary costs, and the development financing needs of the Government, as estimated by the \nDOF. The direct budgetary costs of subprogram 3 include, for example, (i) increasing the \npersonnel budget at BIR (P1 billion in 2009 to address resource constraints at the agency) and \n(ii)  helping  to  meet  the  costs  of  implementing  public  financial  management  initiatives  and \ninstitutionalizing the anticorruption programs at the revenue agencies, the BIR and BOC, among \nother reforms.  \n \n69.  The program loan also reflects the development financing needs of the Government \n(Table 3). In addition to supporting the Government\u2019s efforts to balance the national government \nand consolidate public sector budgets, the DPSP also recognizes the need for fiscal expansion \nin the national government budgets for 2009 and 2010. The Government aims to increase \ndevelopment and social spending in 2009 and, given the need for additional funding to mitigate \n ", "28    \n \nthe effects of the deterioration in economic growth and on poverty rates, the Government \nenvisages a targeted government deficit of 3.2% of GDP in 2009 and 2.5% of GDP in 2010. \nAccording to DOF budget reports, the gross budget financing requirement for 2009 is estimated \nat P660.9 billion, of which the gross external financing requirement is P209.1 billion. Overall, net \nfinancing  requirements  (net  of  amortization)  amount  to  P270.6  billion.  The  proposed  loan \namount of $250 million for subprogram 3 will help close the financing gap for 2009. Other ADB \nprogram loans amounting to a combined $375 million, in addition to the Countercyclical Support \nloan of $500 million, will further help close the financing gap. Other development partners \n(Government of Japan cofinancing DPSP subprograms 2 and 3 and World Bank financing) and \ncommercial  borrowing  (including  the  potential  issuance  of  samurai  bonds  backed  by  a \nGovernment of Japan partial guarantee) will also help to close the financing gap for 2009.   \n \nTable 3: Projected Government Financing Requirements for 2009 \n \n  Amount \n \n  ($ million unless otherwise \n \nFinancing Mix   stated) \n \n   \n \nProgrammed Gross External and Domestic  P660.9 billion \n \nBorrowings \n \nof which:   \n \n   Gross External Borrowing  4,311.0 \n \nADB\u2019s Proposed Program Loan Pipeline  625.0 \n \nDPSP Subprogram 3   250.0 \n \nLGU Finance Reform (subprogram 2)  225.0 \n \nGovernance in Justice Reform  150.0 \n \n(second tranche) \n \nOther ADB   \n \n      Countercyclical Support Facility   500.0 \n \nOther Program Aid  400.0 \n \n       Cofinancing DPSP Subprogram 2  100.0 \n \n(Government of Japan)a \nCommercial borrowingb  2,250.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DPSP = Development Policy Support Program, LGU = local \ngovernment unit.

There is also the potential for a samurai bond issuance of up \nto $1.0 billion equivalent backed by a partial Government of Japan guarantee up to end of \n2010, of which $500 million samurai bond may be issued later in 2009. \nSources: Asian Development Bank; Department of Finance.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n70.  The implementation arrangements established under subprogram 1 will remain under \nsubprogram  3.  The  DOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall  program \nimplementation activities, such as reporting to ADB, administering and disbursing the loan \nproceeds, and maintaining accounts. The DBM and NEDA will be the implementing agencies \nresponsible  for  implementing  subprogram  3,  and  shall  be  supported  by  the  relevant  line \nagencies including the Department of Agriculture, DepEd, the DOH, the DPWH, the DSWD, the \n ", "  29\nDTI, and the OMB. The DPSP coordinating committee initiated under subprogram 1, chaired by \nthe DOF undersecretary and comprising officials from the DOF, the DBM, and NEDA, will be \nresponsible for coordinating implementation and sustaining the DPSP policy actions and the \npost-program monitoring framework together with DBM and relevant line agencies involved in \nsupporting  the  DPSP  and  post-program  monitoring  framework  (DepEd,  the  Department  of \nAgriculture, the DOH, the DPWH, the DSWD, and the OMB). The committee will meet quarterly \nto monitor progress and oversee program implementation and the post-program monitoring \nframework. ADB may be invited to participate in the meetings as an observer.  \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n71.  The subprogram 3 period is from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2009. All actions \nincluded in the policy matrix were implemented between October 2008 and July 2009. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n72.  The program loan of $250 million will be released in a single tranche upon satisfactory \ncompletion of all conditions in the subprogram 3 policy matrix (Appendix 2). The loan proceeds \nwill be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  no  more  than  180  days  before  the \neffectiveness date of the loan. Items specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are excluded. In accordance with the \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for \nProgram Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as \nthe Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required if during each year that loan \nproceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Philippine total imports minus imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch year. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required. \nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans. In accordance \nwith the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for program loans, all \ngoods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will be procured, with \ndue consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard \npublic procedures and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. Goods \ncommonly traded on the international commodity market will be procured in accordance with \nprocedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n73.  The  reform  needs  supported  under  the  DPSP  will  be  financed  by  local  currency \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the subprogram 3 loan.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n74.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \n ", "30    \n \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n75.  A  core  component  of  the  DPSP  cluster  focuses  on  governance  and  reduction  of \ncorruption in key national government agencies vulnerable to such practices. The DPSP cluster \nincludes reforms to public financial management through the MTEF, and measures to improve \ntransparency and accountability in the budget cycle in agencies with large procurement budgets \n(e.g.,  DepEd,  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  DOH,  and  DPWH).  The  DPSP  supports \nimplementation of the procurement reform law and measures to improve transparency in the \nprocurement  process  (para.  75).  The  DPSP  supports  institutionalizing  the  anticorruption \nprograms of RATE and RATS within their agencies to ensure their longer-term sustainability \n(paras. 57\u201358).  \n \n76.  The country\u2019s financial management systems were assessed before subprogram 1 in \n2007 so ADB could better understand the fiduciary risks and determine the appropriate fiduciary \narrangements for the DPSP. This assessment was updated for subprograms 2 and 3. The \nupdate is based on diagnostic work done in the last 12 months including the public expenditure \nand financial accountability assessment led by the World Bank, with ADB participation during \nthe first stage. The assessment identified core areas to be addressed with development partner \nsupport.  Discussions  with  the  Government  during  implementation  of  the  public  financial \nmanagement  triggers  under  subprogram  3  and  its  ongoing  reforms  to  public  financial \nmanagement were also considered. Based on this assessment, the fiduciary arrangements \nproposed for the DPSP remain acceptable. The assessment indicates that the Government has \nmade  progress  in  improving  systems  related  to  public  financial  management,  financial \naccountability,  and  procurement,  although  weaknesses  remain  and  continued  progress  on \nimplementing  the  Government\u2019s  program  to  improve  governance  and  reduce  corruption  is \nessential. The Government places significant emphasis on making progress in implementing the \nMTEF in line ministries and the OPIF; improving the credibility of the budget, its execution, and \nreporting; and the rollout of internal control systems and internal audit. In this regard, the ADB \npolicy  and  advisory  TA  is  designed  to  support  the  DBM  to  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement capacity. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n77.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at the Central Bank of the Philippines to receive all loan proceeds. The \naccount will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. \nThe DOF will be required to submit quarterly progress reports as well as a final report on the \nprogress of subprogram 3 implementation. \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n \n78.  In  cooperation  with  the  DPSP  coordinating  committee  (para.  70),  ADB  and  the \nGovernment of Japan will carry out periodic reviews of program implementation and assess the \nimpact of the DPSP and the post-program monitoring framework. The Government will keep \nADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies \nthat  have  implications for  DPSP  implementation,  and  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to \ncomment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  ADB,  in  collaboration  with  the  coordinating \ncommittee, will undertake a review of program performance 6 months after loan effectiveness to \nreview the outcome of subprogram 3. In addition to the review report, the committee will submit \n ", "  31\nto ADB (within 6 months of loan effectiveness of the subprogram 3) a review  report that \nassesses compliance with, and the impact of, the agreed actions under subprogram 3. A \ncompletion report that shows the overall outcomes and output results of the program cluster, \ntaking into account the interim completion reports prepared for subprograms 1 and 2, will also \nbe prepared and submitted to ADB within 6 months of loan effectiveness for subprogram 3. In \naddition, participants in the PDF (partner agencies, CSOs, and other stakeholders) will be \nencouraged to support civil society monitoring of the DPSP reforms. \n \n79.  The Government and its development partners have agreed on the updated outcome \nand output indicators to monitor DPSP implementation and evaluate its impact, within the \noverall DPSP framework (Appendix 1). \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n80.  In connection with subprogram 3, an advisory technical assistance grant is proposed. \nThis is the second of three TA projects for public financial management envisaged over the next \n3  years  to  continue  ADB's  engagement  in  public  financial  management  reforms  in  the \nPhilippines. The three TA projects are designed to strengthen capacity at the DBM and line \nministries to implement public financial management reforms. The first TA project is providing \nsupport to advance GFMIS dialogue, advisory assistance on budget execution, and piloting the \nICS laying the foundations for subsequent TA. The second TA project will support the DBM, the \nBureau of Treasury, and the DOF to implement and monitor key public financial management \nreforms. The TA will cover capacity development support for the newly established debt and risk \nmanagement  division,  the  rollout  of  an  internal  controls  system  at  the  national  level,  and \ncontinued support to the design and development of the GFMIS, among other activities. Its \nmeasures will be agreed as part of the post-program monitoring framework. The third TA project \nwill build on activities under the second TA project, including the integrated GFMIS, the rollout of \ninternal control systems, debt management, and cash revenue forecasting. The second TA \nproject is estimated to cost $1,150,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide $800,000, to be \nfinanced  by  the  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  (TASF\u2014other  sources).  The  Government  will \nprovide the remaining $350,000 in kind by providing counterpart staff and other facilities. A team \nof international and national consultants will implement the TA. ADB will engage a combination \nof a consulting firm and individuals in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The firm will be engaged following quality- and cost-\nbased selection (80:20 quality\u2013cost ratio) using a simplified technical proposal. A total of 51 \nperson-months of consulting services will be required (18 international and 33 national). The TA \nis expected to commence in the first quarter of 2010 and to be completed by the fourth quarter \nof 2011. The TA purpose, outputs, methodology, implementation arrangements, and budget are \nin Appendix 8, and the terms of reference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n81.  The key benefits expected from the DPSP are as follows: \n(i)  Progress toward medium-term fiscal sustainability will promote macroeconomic \nstability  and  foster  broad-based  economic  growth,  job  creation,  and  poverty \nreduction, all of which are cornerstones of the Government\u2019s MTPDP and PDF.  \n(ii)  Better public financial management governance will improve prioritization and \nefficiency of spending in key sectors such as the social sectors. \n ", "32    \n \n(iii)  Lower transaction costs for business, because of the reduction in bureaucracy, \nwill open new opportunities; increase investment, productivity, and incomes; and \ncreate jobs. \n(iv)  Higher  infrastructure  spending  will  generate  long-term  growth,  stimulate \ninvestment, create jobs, and raise incomes. \n(v)  Increased  spending,  better  targeted  social  assistance  programs,  and \nimplementation of the CCT program will improve social sector outcomes. The \nexpansion of the CCT program will have potential gender benefits for maternal \nhealth and girls' education: (i) pregnant women will receive pre- and postnatal \ncare beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the birth will be attended \nby  a  skilled  health  professional;  (ii)  parents  will  attend  parent  effectiveness \nservice classes; (iii) children aged 0\u20135 will receive regular preventive health \ncheckups and vaccines; (iv) children aged 3\u20135 will attend day care or preschool \nprograms; and (v) children aged 6\u201314 will be enrolled in school and demonstrate \nat least an 85% attendance rate at school. The Government is intending to begin \nbenchmarking data in third quarter of 2009 to assess program performance. \n(vi)  The institutionalization of governance programs including the MTEF, regulatory \nimpact assessments and the anticorruption initiatives in the BIR and the BOC will \nimprove the sustainability of key governance programs. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n82.  The DPSP is subject to the following risks: \n(i)  The global financial crisis has hurt the Philippines. The major impact on the \neconomy has been the second-round effects of the decline in global demand and \nits fiscal repercussions. The economic slowdown in the Philippines and the risk of \na decline in remittances will feed into higher poverty in 2009. However, the \nimpact on poverty will be partly offset through the scaling up of the CCT program \nand an increase in infrastructure development in 2009 and 2010. \n(ii)  With the economic stresses in 2009 and an election in 2010, the Government \nand or members of Congress may be tempted to introduce populist policies that \ncould  threaten  fiscal  discipline  in  2010.  However,  the  Government  has \nannounced its budget target for 2010 at 2% of GDP and since 2006 it has \ndemonstrated  commitment  to  meeting  its  fiscal  targets.  The  post-program \nframework will ensure dialogue is continued with the Government on fiscal policy.  \n(iii)  The 2010 presidential elections may slow implementation of reforms. However, \nthe  Government  has  full  ownership  of  the  DPSP  reform  program,  which  is \nembedded  in  the  Philippines  Development  Forum  and  its  sector  strategies. \nMoreover, the Government, ADB, and the Government of Japan have agreed to \na post-DPSP program monitoring framework to maintain progress on reforms.  \n(iv)  Weak  capacity  in  some  of  the  crucial  spending  agencies  (such  as  the \nDepartment of Agriculture) may limit the effectiveness of the Government's fiscal \nstimulus in 2009 and the long-term delivery of services. Longer-term institutional \nreforms may be needed in some agencies.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n83.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the development needs as outlined \nunder the DPSP implementation arrangements. \n ", "  33\n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the date of subprogram 3 of the DPSP \nloan agreement, as described in the development policy letter (including the \npolicy matrix), will continue to be in effect for the duration of subprogram 3.  \n(iii)  A completion report that shows the overall outcomes and output results of the \nprogram cluster taking into account the interim completion reports prepared for \nsubprograms 1 and 2 will be prepared and submitted to ADB within 6 months of \nloan effectiveness of the subprogram 3. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n84.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$250,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 3 of the Development Policy \nSupport Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Program Loan Agreement presented \nto the Board. \n \n \n \n    Haruhiko Kuroda \n    President \n       \n \n24 August 2009 \n ", "34  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n      Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  Performance Targets  Update to  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Subprogram 3  Mechanisms  And Risks \nImpact   By 2010, revised      Assumption \n  MTPDP goals attained:      Macroeconomic and \n        political stability \nSustainable higher  Real gross domestic  Economic growth  National Statistics   \neconomic growth  product (GDP) growth  7.2% in 2007 and  Office (NSO) data  Risks \n  at 6%\u20137% per annum  4.6% in 2008   and National  Lack of effective \n    (regressed,  Statistics  coordination among \n    however potential  Coordination Board  national government \nLower unemployment  Unemployment reduced  growth remains at  (NSCB)  departments \nfrom 8% in 2005 to  6%)   \n6.5% in 2010a            A prolonged and severe \nglobal recession will \nUnemployment  Annual national labor \nlead to increase fiscal \nreduced from 7.9%  force surveys from \nstress, and higher \nin 2006 to 7.3% in  NSO \nunemployment and \n2007.

Earlier in 2008, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) shifted to a tighter monetary \nposition to counter possible second round inflationary effects from the commodity price surge. \nThen in the fourth quarter it shifted to an expansionary position to ensure sufficient liquidity in \nthe banking system against rapidly falling inflation. By May 2009 inflation had fallen to 3.3% well \nwithin the BPS's inflation target for 2009. To boost confidence in the financial sector, the \nGovernment  took  a  number  of  preemptive  measures  aimed  at  increasing  liquidity  in  the \ndomestic bank system, assuring confidence of depositors, and strengthening the central bank's \nlender of last resort facility.  \n \nWith these preemptive measures in place, the macroeconomy stabilized and key indicators \nshowed encouraging signs of improvement. Commercial bank lending continued robust growth \nat about 20% in the first quarter of 2009 on a year-on-year basis; the stock market and the peso \nhave stabilized since November and yields on domestic bonds have recently fallen back to pre-\ncrisis levels, Gross international reserves continued to accumulate in 2009, equivalent to 6.3 \nmonths of import cover and three times greater than external debt maturing this year, providing \na sufficient buffer against further moderate external shocks. Spreads on Philippine sovereign \ndollar bonds have also declined in recent months but still remain above pre-crisis levels.  \n \nThe global crisis has impacted on our fiscal situation, although this remains manageable as a \nresult of successful implementation of our fiscal consolidation strategy since 2004. Our fiscal \nconsolidation efforts brought down the non-financial sector public debt from over 100% of GDP \nin 2003 to 61 % at the end of 2008 back to levels last seen in the early 1990s. Perhaps one of \nthe most important achievements of the fiscal consolidation program has been the creation of \nfiscal space to mitigate some of the poverty impacts from the global crisis in 2009. In particular, \nthe program has resulted in an increased share of discretionary spending from 26 % of total \nbudget expenditures in 2006 to 37 % in 2008, with the social sectors and infrastructure the main \nbeneficiaries. \n \nWith  these  challenging  times,  and  our  lessons  learned  from  the  1998  crisis  and  its \nrepercussions for fiscal sustainability, we are committed to maintain fiscal discipline necessary \nto maintain investor confidence in the economy, while at the same time creating fiscal space to \nprotect spending in the social sectors and provide an effective and timely stimulus to the \neconomy. Therefore, we are targeting a budget deficit of 3.2% of GDP in 2009, lower than our \nregional neighbors. The budget provides for an increase in discretionary spending as part of our \ncountercyclical stimulus. Key initiatives include the scaling up of the conditional cash transfer \nprogram (CCT) to 337,234 households in 2008 and 2009 and we intend to scale it up further. \nWe have also begun implementing the Comprehensive Livelihood and Emergency Employment \nProgram (CLEEP) with a target of creating 373,117 jobs.

The sector analysis assesses recent macroeconomic developments and identifies the \nissues  and  threats  faced  by  the  Government  in  achieving  its  medium-term  development \nobjectives  of  fiscal  sustainability,  macroeconomic  performance,  and  poverty  reduction.  The \nimmediate pressing issues for macroeconomic policy are the deceleration in economic growth \nand its fiscal repercussions. The critical issues for the Government in the short term are to \nsustain critical public spending and to address additional financing needs arising from the \ndecline in tax revenues in the first quarter of 2009. Over the medium term, the Government \npriorities include sustaining priority spending by raising revenues, improving the efficiency of \npublic expenditure management, and increasing the effectiveness of debt management. The \nGovernment has outlined a revised fiscal sustainability strategy with medium-term balanced \nbudget targets. While the balanced budget target has served the Philippines well over the last 4 \nyears, the current crisis has provided an opportunity to revisit the policy of balancing the budget \ntarget and explore alternative fiscal rules that could anchor fiscal policy and operations in the \nfuture.   \n \nA.   Economic Growth and Inflation \n \n2.  Economic growth was 4.6% in 2008, lower than the 7.3% in 2007, but above the regional \naverage. The slower economic growth was a combination of a contraction in public spending in \nthe first quarter of 2008, a surge in domestic inflation that reduced domestic consumption from \n6% in 2007 to 4.6% in 2008, and the recession in the United States that lowered demand for \nPhilippines  exports.  Private  investment  continued  to  expand  in  the  first  half  of  2008,  with \npurchases of durable equipment expanding by 6% on a year-on-year basis, among the highest \nrates for a decade, and private construction expanding by 20% for 2008. As the global crisis has \nintensified since September 2008 and global demand has contracted, investment and trade has \nslowed.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2009,  the  economy  decelerated  sharply  to  contract  by  an \nannualized 2.3% (seasonally adjusted) as exports plunged and consumption stalled. Economic \ngrowth for 2009 is projected to be in the range of 0.8%\u20131.8%. This translates to a negative \noutput gap of 4%\u20135% of GDP (Figure A4.1). Indicative of a sharp cyclical downturn in the \neconomy is the rapid fall in core inflation, which reached 3.3% in July 2009, down from its peak \nof 8.0% in November 2008 and the fall in tax collection of 5.2% in the first semester of 2009. \n \n \n ", "52  Appendix 4 \nFigure A4.1: Output Gap and Inflation \n \n  (a) Potential and Actual Economic Growth 1970\u20132009      (b) Headline and Core Inflation Jan 2008 to April 2009 \n                                                                                                     (monthly rates, year-on-year) \n10 14\n8 12\n6\n10\n4\n8\n2  \nth %6\nw\no 0\nr\n% g -219 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 20 20 20 20 4\n7 7 7 7 8 8 8 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n-40 3 6 9 2 5 8 1 4 7 0 3 6 9 2\n-6 0\nJFMAMJJASONDJFMA\n-1-08 an-08eb-08ar-08pr-08ay-08un-08ul-08ug-08ep-08ct-08ov-08ec-08an-09eb-09ar-09pr-09\nGDP growth Potential growth Core Inflation Headline Inflation\n \nNotes: The potential economic growth rate is estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, which estimates a nonlinear \ntrend in the economic growth data.

Financial Sector \n \n3.  The direct impacts of the global financial crisis on the domestic banking system have so \nfar have been limited. Spillovers from the global financial crisis on the Philippine domestic \nfinancial  system\u2014especially  in  the  banking  sector\u2014has  been  relatively  muted  because  of \nlimited exposure to troubled US assets, and low exposure to securitization and off-balance \nsheet activities. The banking system remains sound, with the sector's capital adequacy ratio at \n14% and gross nonperforming loans at 3.6% as of end of May 2009 (Figure A4.2).

Fiscal Policy \n \n1.  Fiscal Crisis and Consolidation \n5.  Fiscal  consolidation  from  2004  to  2007.  Fiscal  indiscipline,  coupled  with  poor \nmonetary policy management until 1993 when the central bank was reformed, were the main \ncontributors to macroeconomic instability from the late 1970s to 2004. In 2005, the Philippines \nemerged from a period of serious fiscal difficulty. From 1998 to 2004, budget revenues dropped, \nwhich significantly suppressed expenditure in the social sectors, leading to a substantial decline \nin public sector real wages.1 The deficit reached 5.2% of GDP and the nonfinance public sector \ndebt exceeded 100% of GDP in 2004. The high and unsustainable deficits triggered bouts of \npeso exchange rate instability. The Government has restored macroeconomic stability and \nmaintained  it  through  fiscal  discipline.  The  cornerstone  and  the  measure  with  the  highest \nrevenue impact was the reform of value-added tax in November 2005, which extended the \nvalue-added tax base to energy products, and increased the rate from 10% to 12% effective \nFebruary 2006. Other measures included increasing (i) excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco \nproducts by 30% at the end of 2004 (increased again in January 2007 and January 2009, \nalthough not fully indexed to inflation), (ii) the corporate income tax rate from 32% to 35% \n(which reverted to 30% in January 2009 as mandated in the amendments to tax legislation), and \n(iii)  electricity  tariffs.  As  a  consequence  of  these  reforms,  tax  revenues  grew  by  over  1.3 \npercentage points of GDP in 2006, the national government deficit fell to 0.9% of GDP from \n2.7% in 2005, and the consolidated public sector budget turned in a surplus for the first time in \nalmost a decade, aided by the improvement in the finances of the National Power Corporation. \nFiscal consolidation continued in 2007 with the national government deficit falling to 0.2% of \nGDP and the consolidated public sector budget remaining in surplus for a second consecutive \nyear.  \n \n6.  Increased social expenditures. The fiscal crisis and subsequent consolidation program \nsuppressed  expenditures  in  the  social  sectors  and  in  infrastructure.  However,  by  2006 \nsubstantial resources were freed for priority spending in the 2007\u20132009 budgets. In particular, \ndiscretionary  spending  in  the  national  government  budget  increased  from  26%  of  total \nexpenditures  in  2006  to  37%  in  2008  with  the  social  sectors  and  infrastructure  the  main \nbeneficiaries (Figure A4.3). The Government has provided substantial real increases in social \nspending with the Department of Health (DOH) budget doubled in 2009 compared with its 2006 \nlevels; the Department of Education (DepEd) budget up by 42% in real terms over the same \nperiod; and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) budget up by 300% in \nreal terms over the same period. \n \n                                                 \n1  For a detailed discussion on the fiscal problem and consolidation strategy see Appendix 4 of ADB. 2008.

Global Financial Crisis and Fiscal Expansion \n7.  Fiscal  policy  behavior  over  the  economic  cycle. In the past, fiscal policy in the \nPhilippines has not been effective in mitigating the effects of economic downturns. This is partly \na characteristic of most developing economies, as fiscal policy usually does not have embedded \nin it automatic stabilizers on the expenditure side of the national government budget that would \nallow for effective countercyclical spending. In the Philippines, relatively high public debt and \nlarge nondiscretionary commitments (interest payments and transfers to local government units) \nin  the  budget  limited  the  opportunity  for  discretionary  countercyclical  spending.  The  fiscal \nconsolidation program that has been in carried out since 2004 suppressed primary expenditures. \nThe national government budget does have modest automatic stabilizers on the revenue side \nbut these are generally offset by the expenditure side so that the overall national primary budget \nbalance appears to be generally neutral to economic downturns. Figure A4.4 presents trends in \nthe Philippines' fiscal policy behavior over the economic cycle (as measured by the output gap). \nIt shows the percentage point changes in tax revenues to GDP since 1991 mapped against the \neconomic cycle. As is apparent from the figures, tax revenues tend to be moderately procyclical, \ni.e., tax collections grow more quickly than nominal GDP during higher growth periods (implying \nan increase in the tax ratio) and drop more quickly than nominal GDP during economic troughs \n(implying a fall in the tax ratio). Indirect taxes (excluding customs duties) levied on goods and \nservices and direct income taxes generally move together over the economic cycle, although \nchanges in direct income taxes tend to carry over into the next year as the tax code permits \ncorporations to carry over losses to the succeeding fiscal year. The large drop in tax collections \nin the first 4 months of 2009 is consistent with this cyclical pattern. Tax (cash) collections from \nthe Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) fell 6.5% on a year-on-year basis.2 Customs collection \n(duties and VAT on imported goods) from the Bureau of Customs (BOC) fell 12% for the same 4 \nmonths on a year-on-year basis as imports plummeted. The 13% drop in VAT collection on \nimported goods was the major contributor to the fall in customs revenue during this period. \nBased on this cyclical pattern, and assuming only a gradual economic recovery in 2010, ADB \n                                                 \n2 The increase in the tax bracket threshold for wage earners introduced in July 2008 and the reduction in the \ncorporate tax rate from 35% to 30% effective in January 2009 will also lower income tax in 2009. DOF estimates \nthese measures will lower tax collection by up to P40 billion. \n ", "56  Appendix 4 \nstaff estimates that the tax\u2013GDP ratio will drop in 2009 and the drop in the direct income tax \nratio may also carry over into 2010. On the expenditure side of the budget, the ratio of primary \nexpenditures to GDP (net of statutory spending such as interest payments and transfers to \nLGUs) do not exhibit a distinct cyclical pattern. However, in some periods a procyclical pattern is \nobserved, because it appears that primary expenditures are linked to performance on the \nrevenue side, so when revenues rise faster than nominal GDP (mainly during high economic \ngrowth years), so does expenditure, and vice versa.  \n \nTable A4.1: Bureau of Customs Collections, 2007\u20132009 \nTotal collected for \nTotal collected   Growth  January to April  Growth \n(P billion)  rate   (P billion)  rate  \nItem  2007  2008 (%)  2008 2009  (%) \nTotal Collection  209.4  260.2 24.3 70.6 64.7  (8.3) \n  Import duties  67.0  88.4 31.9 21.7 20.7  (4.5) \n  Import tax  142.4  171.8 20.7 48.9 44.0  (10.1) \n      of which VAT  129.0  156.3 21.2 44.2 38.5  (12.9) \nNote: Import taxes refer to VAT and excise collected on imported goods. \nSource: Bureau of Customs, Department of Finance. \n \n8.  Fiscal stimulus in 2009. As a consequence of the lack of automatic stabilizers in the \nbudget, governments in developing countries tend to boost discretionary expenditures, such as \ninfrastructure spending, cash transfers to the poor, and other subsidies. The Government of the \nPhilippines has provided a fiscal stimulus to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn on \nthe poor and to maintain priority spending programs in infrastructure and the social sectors. The \n2009  budget  stimulus  comes  from  a  substantial  boost  in  infrastructure  and  social  sector \nspending. In particular, the Government has increased allocations to social assistance programs \nto  mitigate  the  poverty  impacts  of  the  crisis.  These  include  scaling  up  coverage  of  the \nconditional cash transfer (CCT) program from 20,000 households in 2007 to 337,345 in 2008 \nand 2009 with further scaling up expected,  expanding the hunger-mitigation program, and \ndeveloping the Comprehensive Livelihood and Emergency Employment Program with a target \nof creating 373,117 jobs in 2009. The Government has also implemented several measures to \nensure the fiscal expansion is an effective stimulus for the economy. These include accelerating \ndisbursements of critical public spending, promoting advance procurement, and front-loading \nsocial and capital spending by 60% in the first semester (P84 billion\u2013P112 billion). It has also \nfocused  on  programs  that  are  quick-disbursing  and  labor-intensive,  and  that  have  larger \nmultiplier effects. These measures have improved utilization rates (ratio of disbursements to \ncash releases to line ministries) from 80% in 2008 to 97% in the first quarter of 2009.  With the \nmodest stimulus and projected fall in budget revenues from 2009 budget plan, the national \ngovernment deficit is projected to rise from P68 billion in 2008 to P250 billion in 2009. With the \ndownward revision in nominal GDP growth, the national government budget deficit is projected \nat 3.2% of GDP. This translates to a fiscal expansion of 2.3% of GDP over 2008 levels, \nrelatively modest compared with those in neighboring economies. \n ", " \nFigure A4.4: Fiscal Policy Behavior over the Economic Cycle \n \n      (a) Output Gap and Changes in the Tax Revenue\u2013GDP Ratio             (b) Output Gap and Changes in Direct and Indirect Taxes\u2013GDP Ratio              \n3 3\n2 2\n1 1\n0 0\nGDP -1 199 199 199 199 199 199 199 199 199 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 -1 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 000 001 002 003 004 005 006 007 008 009\n%  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n-2 -2\n-3 -3\n-4 -4\n-5 -5\nOutput Gap Total Tax Revenue Output Gap Indirect Tax Direct Income Tax\n          \n      (c) Output Gap and Changes in NG Primary Expenditures\u2013GDP Ratio  (d) Output and Changes in the NG Primary Budget Balance\u2013GDP Ratio \nFiscal expansion\n3 3\n2 2\n1 1\n0 0\nGDP -1 199 199 199 199 199 199 199 199 199 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 GDP -1 199 199 199 199 199 200 200 200 200 200\n%  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 %  1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9\n-2 -2\n-3 -3\n-4 -4\n-5 -5\nOutput Gap Primary Expenditure Fiscal contraction Output gap NG Primary Fiscal Stance         A\n           p\np\nGDP = gross domestic product, NG = national government.  e\nn\nSources: ADB; Bureau of Treasury; Department of Finance estimates.    d\nix\n  5 4         \n7\n    ", "58  Appendix 4 \n3.  Medium-Term Fiscal Policy Issues \n \n9.  Considerable fiscal gains have been achieved since 2005, and fiscal space has been \nprovided from increased tax revenues. Building on these is an important medium-term goal. In \nthe context of the current crisis and the Government's medium-term budget framework, the four \nmajor medium-term issues are: (i) exploring alternative fiscal rules to balance the budget, \n(ii) sustaining priority spending by increasing revenues, (iii) improving the efficiency of public \nexpenditure management, and (iv) better debt management practices. \n \n10.  Alternative  fiscal  rules. While the Government's fiscal policy and its medium-term \ntarget of a balanced budget has served the Philippines very well in achieving consolidation, the \nglobal crisis has provided an opportunity to explore with stakeholders alternative fiscal rules. As \ndiscussed in paras. 8\u20139, in the past fiscal policy has not been effective in mitigating the effects \nof the economic cycle. In fact budget expenditures have at times exhibited a procyclical pattern. \nMoreover, because of external shocks to the economy, the balanced budget target has been \nchanged three times since 2005, potentially undermining its credibility. An increasing number of \ncountries  have  adopted  fiscal  rules  to  anchor  fiscal  policy  and  these  rules  are  generally \nformalized through legislation such as fiscal responsibility acts. Rules may pertain to debt, \nbudget balances (overall or primary), expenditures, or some combination of these.3 For example, \nThailand does not set budget ceilings but anchors fiscal policy in debt rules set in legislation and \nMinistry of Finance policy guidelines for public debt. It may also be feasible to anchor fiscal \npolicy to public debt rules in the Philippines. The post-program monitoring framework includes a \nmeasure to assess fiscal policy and explores the feasibility of formalizing fiscal rules.  \n \n11.  Sustaining priority spending. The Government\u2019s goal is to raise national government \nnoninterest expenditures by an additional 1 percentage point of GDP over the next 2 years \n(excluding countercyclical spending in 2009). To achieve this goal, the Government targets an \nincrease in tax revenues to 15%. The tax revenue target is achievable over the medium term \nbut requires greater efforts. Revenue management is challenged by (i) the proliferation of tax \nincentives in growth sectors of the economy that may have resulted in as much as P47 billion in \nforegone revenues; (ii) generous income tax deductions that have eroded the tax base; (iii) a \npoorly structured excise tax regime; and (iv) weak tax administration, including administering \nvalue added tax and modernizing business procedures and systems of revenue district offices \n(RDOs). The Government is systematically addressing these issues. The Bureau of Internal \nRevenue (BIR) has a comprehensive tax administration reform program to 2010 with support \nfrom the World Bank, Swedish International Development Agency, and ADB (in 2008), but \nimplementation has been slower than expected. This is partly due to the complexity of the \nreform program and its outreach to all RDOs, but it is also because the BIR lacks resources. \nNevertheless, progress has been made. The Government has allocated an additional P1.0 \nbillion to its personnel budget and this could potentially increase staffing by 25%. Ninety-seven \npercent of all uncomputerized RDOs have now been computerized and the backlog of tax \nregistrations and returns has been reduced, with over 350,000 tax registrations and 1.2 million \nin income return files encoded into the electronic system. The Government has also submitted \ndraft bills to Congress on amending excise tax legislation (submitted in 2008) and consolidating \ninvestment incentives (submitted at the end of 2007) to improve revenue sustainability.  Over \nthe longer term, the Government will need to continue to address budget resource allocations to \nthe BIR as it implements its tax reforms and enhances tax administration in monitoring tax \ncredits, managing tax arrears, tax audits, and anticorruption programs. Tax exemptions initiated \nby Congress have eroded the tax base in recent years. \n                                                 \n3 IMF. 2009.

Medium-term  sustainable  priority  spending  requires \nimproving  efficiency  in  public  expenditure  management  by  ensuring  a  balanced  public \nexpenditure  program  for  capital  spending  and  recurrent  expenditures,  as  well  as  for \ndiscretionary and nondiscretionary spending items (interest payments and wages). This will \nrequire continuing to reorient spending to the priority sectors of education, health, and public \ninfrastructure.  Implementing  better  public  expenditure  management  systems,  including  the \nmedium-term expenditure framework, which align the budget planning process with strategic \nobjectives and priorities, is integral to improving efficiency in public expenditure management. \nProgress is being made. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has incorporated \nthe  medium-term  framework  into  the  2009  and  2010  budgets,  including  updating  forward \nestimates for a 3-year rolling period for all 23 national agencies. It is now computerizing the \ncomputation of forward estimates before rolling it out to priority line ministries. The DBM has \nproduced national guidelines on internal audit systems and is currently piloting internal control \nsystems in the DepEd and the DPWH, with the DSWD and the Department of Labor and \nEmployment scheduled for later in 2009. However, during the Development Policy Support \nProgram  (DPSP),  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners  have  identified \nseveral core areas that need to be addressed, from budget preparation through to budget \nexecution, including improving cash management and reporting, which will require a much \nlonger-term, coordinated effort, and a platform approach to capacity development.  \n \n13.  Debt sustainability. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) undertook an Article IV \nConsultation with the Philippines in November 2008 (footnote 2). As part of its consultations, the \nIMF undertook a debt sustainability assessment (DSA) based on different economic growth, \ninterest rate, primary budget balance, and exchange rate shocks. The IMF updated its DSA for \nthe purposes of the DPSP 3. This appendix summarizes the pertinent findings of the DSA. \n \n14.  The Philippines' public sector debt is broadly sustainable, but short-term risks have \nincreased due to global financial instability. Public debt as a share of GDP has declined to ratios \nlast seen in the early 1990s, but remains high by regional standards. At the end of 2008, \nnational government public debt amounted to 56% of GDP, down from its peak of 83% in 2003 \n(Figure A3). Nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) debt declined to 59.9% from 101.0% during the \nsame period (Figure A3). A prudent borrowing strategy, including lengthening the average \nmaturity of debt to 7.1 years and moving to domestic financing;4 fiscal discipline (operating \nprimary budget surpluses); and sustained economic growth contributed to the rapid decline. \nDebt servicing costs as a share of national government budget revenues also declined from \n36.7% in 2005 to 22.6% in 2007, thereby freeing up substantial resources for priority spending \nsince 2007. However, at 8% of GDP, the Philippines\u2019 public debt servicing costs (amortization \nand interest payments) are high by regional standards.  \n \n15.  The updated IMF DSA indicates that public sector debt is broadly sustainable. In the \nbaseline scenario, no new fiscal measures are introduced over the medium term apart from \nplanned reduction of the corporate income tax rate in 2009. In this scenario, the nonfinancial \nsector public debt initially rises to about 65% in 2009/2010 and then declines back to 60% of \nGDP in 2014. While debt dynamics are favorable overall, they remain vulnerable to shocks, \nespecially exchange rate fluctuations, as 40% of public debt is external. For example, the IMF \nsimulated a one-time permanent real depreciation of 30%, which led to a 20 percentage point \nincrease in the external debt ratio from 2009, which would remain close to 80% in the medium \n                                                 \n4  Share of foreign currency denominated debt in total NFPS debt fell from 68.3% in 2003 to 36.1% in 2008. \n \n ", "60  Appendix 4 \nterm. The assessment also notes rising resilience to interest rate and growth shocks. Given the \nlengthening of maturities and increasing utilization of domestic financing, external debt is less \naffected by world interest rates and domestic growth shocks. It is only moderately affected by \nnoninterest shocks to the current account. The DSA also simulates the impact of lower primary \nbudget surpluses on debt over the medium term. It assumes a reduction in the average surplus \nfrom 2.7% of GDP to 1.3%. Under this scenario, the NFPS debt would be 64% in 2014. The \nvarious scenarios are summarized in Table A4.2, with the baseline NFPS debt at 60% of GDP \nby 2014. \n  \nTable 4A.2: Public Debt Sustainability: Bound Tests (%) \nNFPS Debt  NFPS Debt \nScenario  Ratio in 2008  Ratio in 2014  Scenario Shocks \n1.

The outlook for fiscal policy (Table A4.3) presents the Government\u2019s \nbaseline scenario based on assumptions on revenue collections, economic growth in the range \nof 0.8%\u20131.8% in 2009, relatively low inflation of 2.5%\u20134.5%, a stable exchange rate in the range \nof P46\u2013P49 = $1, and continuing tax administration reforms supported by the DPSP. The fiscal \ndeficit is projected to be 3.2% in 2009 (revised in June 2009 up from 2.2% in February 2009). \nThe Government's medium-term fiscal projections are 2.0% in 2010, 1.5% in 2011, and 0.5% in \n2012, consistent with the need to ensure longer-term debt sustainability. The fiscal consolidation \nis primarily driven by a stronger revenue effort, with tax revenues projected to rise by about \n1.0% of GDP over the next 3 years and cut back in temporary, countercyclical expenditures. \nThe national government debt would rise a little to 57.6% in 2009 and 58%\u201359% in 2010 \nensuring sustainable debt and providing a buffer in the event of future shocks to the economy. \nWhile  the  scenario  is  indicative,  it  does  demonstrate  the  need  to  continue  increasing  the \nrevenue effort. \n \n17.  The Government has outlined a strategy to support a sustainable adjustment in fiscal \npolicy for 2009\u20132013 and measures to improve public expenditure management supported by \nthe DPSP. The Government will \n(i)  continue to implement tax policy reforms to enhance the revenue system by \nbroadening the tax base, rationalizing income tax incentives and excise taxes, \n ", "Appendix 4  61\nincluding  through  a  revised  tax  incentives  rationalization  bill  submitted  to \nCongress at the end of 2007 (progress has been made in deliberations and \nCongress is expected to pass the bill in 2009\u2014its revenue effects will not begin \nto be realized until 2010) and draft amendments to excise legislation submitted to \nCongress  at  the  end  of  2008  (including  reducing  the  number  of  bands  and \nindexing specific taxes to inflation);  \n(ii)  strengthen tax administration, including by completing the update of taxpayer \nregistration; reduce the backlog of tax return files and tax number applications, \nimproving registration processes and production of a registration, audit strategies, \nmanagement of arrears, and tracking and monitoring of tax credits; \n(iii)  increase spending on the social sectors and public infrastructure in the 2008 and \n2009 budgets; \n(iv)  strengthen debt management systems to bring them in line with international best \npractice including establishing a debt and risk management division to act as a \nmiddle function office at DOF; \n(v)  continue to implement a rolling 3-year, medium-term expenditure framework and \ncomputation of forward estimates; and \n(vi)  implement  a  program  to  strengthen  budget  execution  including  initiating \ndevelopment of the government financial management information system, and \nthe rollout of internal control systems with technical assistance from ADB, among \nothers.  \n \n \nTable A4.3: Philippines\u2014National Government Fiscal Program \n(% of GDP) \n  Actuals  Fiscal Target \n Indicator  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 \nNonfinancial Sector Public Deficit  (5.0)  (2.1)  0.1  0.4  0.4  \u2015 \n  National Government Budget Deficit   \n(DOF definition)  (3.8)  (2.7)  (1.1)  (0.2)  (0.9)  (3.2) \n  National Government Budget Deficit     \n(IMF definition) a  (4.2)  (3.0)  (1.2)  (1.7)  (1.5)  \u2015 \nRevenues (excluding grants)  14.5  15.1  16.2  17.1  16.0  15.9 \nTax Revenue  12.5  13.0  14.3  14.0  14.0  13.9 \nNontax Revenue  2.0  2.1  1.9  3.1  2.0  2.0 \n of which privatizations  0.0  0.0  0.1  1.4  0.4  0.4 \n of which privatizations (P billion)  0.4  2.4  5.8  90.6  31.3  30.0 \nExpenditure and Net Lending   18.3  17.8  17.3  17.3  16.9  19.1 \n of which non-interest expenditures  12.9  12.2  12.2  12.6  13.2  15.0 \n of which infrastructure   1.3  1.5  1.6  2.0     \n             \nMemorandum Items             \n             \n Nonfinancial Public Sector Debt  96.0  87.0  74.0  67.0  61.0   \n National Government Debt  78.5  71.8  63.8  55.8  56.3  57.6 \n( ) = negative, \u2015 = no available data, DOF = Department of Finance, IMF = International Monetary Fund. \na Fund definition: Excludes privatization receipts of the national government and includes net deficit from restructuring \nthe central bank.  \nSources: Department of Finance. 2009.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines: The Development Policy Support Program \n(DPSP) policy areas largely correspond with those of the Government as spelled out in the Medium-Term Philippine \nDevelopment Plan (MTPDP) 2004\u20132010, which focuses on five core areas: (i) economic growth and job creation; (ii) energy \ndependency and power sector reforms; (iii) social justice and basic needs; (iv) education and youth opportunities; and \n(v) anticorruption measures and governance. The MTPDP mission is to \u201cfight poverty by building prosperity for the greatest \nnumber of Filipino people.\u201d  \n \nThe focus of ADB's Country Strategy and Program (CSP) and the country operations business plan (COBP) for the \nPhilippines is on fiscal consolidation, an improved investment climate, and accelerated  progress toward the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), as confirmed by the country assistance program evaluation (CAPE) for the Philippines and an \nADB study on the critical development constraints in the country. The Government has made substantial progress in \naddressing fiscal consolidation.  This is necessary to increase social expenditures. However, the global financial crisis and \nsecond-round external demand destruction has hurt the Philippines and has had fiscal repercussions. Pressures on the fiscal \nsituation are exerted from two sources. On the one hand, there are increased public demands for additional social spending to \nmitigate the impact of the crisis on poverty. On the other, there was a decline in budget revenues in the first semester of 2009. \nThe challenge faced by the Government is to protect recent gains in social expenditures while also providing additional \nassistance through its social programs such as the CCT program; carrying out a fiscal stimulus through increase infrastructure \nspending; and ensuring medium-term debt sustainability. Consequently, the national government budget deficit will rise to \n3.2% of GDP in 2009 and 2% in 2010. The DPSP will contribute to measures to protect critical public spending and at the \nsame time will ensure ensures fiscal discipline.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe deceleration in the Philippine economy threatens to reverse recent gains in reducing unemployment, which has been \nsteadily declining in the last 2 years. Most recently, it has increased from 7.3% in 2008 to 7.6% in 2009. Other indicators point \nto the adverse effects of the crisis on the labor market. Economic growth in 2009 is estimated in the range of 0.8%\u20131.8%, this \ntranslates to a decline in per capita incomes of \u20131.7% to \u20130.7%. This would result in an increase in the incidence of poverty. If \nremittances fall this would also increase poverty. To mitigate the impacts of the crisis, the Government has piloted the \nconditional cash transfer (CCT) program to 337,345 families in 2008 and 2009. This is likely to cushion the impact on poverty \nin the same way as Indonesia's unconditional cash transfer scheme.  \n \n2. Design Features. With support through the DPSP, the Government is addressing these issues of poverty and vulnerability \nto poverty by reforming social protection programs, scaling up the CCT program, increasing spending on the social sectors, \ninfrastructure, and labor-intensive public employment programs (such as the Comprehensive Livelihood and Emergency \nEmployment Program). \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nThe DPSP supports the Government to address these issues through the program\u2019s public financial management and social \nsector components. Under subprogram 3, additional policy triggers were introduced specifically to mitigate the poverty \nimpacts of the current global crisis. The DPSP supports increased spending on the social sectors in areas where the \nPhilippines is lagging in progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), for example in education. It also \nsupports the piloting and scaling up of the CCT program, which links assistance with outcomes in family education and health. \nThe DPSP also supports the public employment program; and the speeding up of disbursements of critical public spending \nand advancing procurement process through Department of Budget and Management crisis-related initiatives. \n ", "Appendix 5  63\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nFindings of Social Analysis  \nADB assessments suggest that the possible decline in per capita incomes in 2009 and increased unemployment will \nexacerbate the economic downturn. Empirical analysis, on the whole, shows that in the Philippines the impact on poverty will \nbe short-term (1\u20133 years) assuming the economy begins to recover in 2010.  If the global economy is slow to recover, or the \ndomestic recovery is weak, poverty and unemployment effects will manifest themselves over a longer period. The magnitude \nof the recovery and growth of remittances from overseas Filipino workers will be critical. As of June of 2009, remittances \nremain flat and are expected to decline in the range of 2%\u20134% in second semester of 2009. However, a disconcerting \nprospect is a possible substantial downward revision in the global economic outlook for 2009\u20132010, which would affect the \nprospects for exports and remittances. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nAs part of the DPSP process, extensive consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives \nof the private sector, civil society groups, and development partners. The key forum is the Philippines Development Forum \n(PDF) which meets twice a year, although smaller groups meet more often. Under a technical assistance project for \ncompetitiveness (attached to DPSP subprogram 1), ADB engaged a research institute to carry out a survey of 500 \nhouseholds and 1,300 individuals in February 2009 to solicit information on income, expenditure and employment experience. \nA second survey of the same households and an additional 500 will be carried out in July 2009 for the same purpose and to \nsolicit information about the impact of the crisis on household welfare and specific social sector issues related to health and \neducation. \n \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \nC.   Gender and Development \nKey Issues. The DPSP has indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on reducing poverty and unemployment by \nreorienting public expenditures to social services and productive needs. The improved poverty orientation of public spending \nincreases women\u2019s access to essential services needed for achieving MDG targets, including improving child and maternal \nhealth.  \n2.  Key Actions.

Partial accomplishment  \n(i) cleaning the corporate taxpayers \n(i) Encoding backlog of tax data\u2014substantially accomplished. By the \ndatabase and (ii) encoding of \nend of 2008, 71 (97%) of the remaining 75 RDOs had been \nbacklog of tax registration and tax \ncomputerized. The four remaining uncomputerized RDOs in southern \nreturn files. \nMindanao will be completed when security conditions permit. Of the 35 \n  USAID and MCC-assisted RDOs, 27 have completed the encoding of a \nbacklog of tax information, and encoding in 11 MCC-assisted RDOs \nongoing. Encoding includes 348,465 tax registrations, 1,235,889 \nincome tax returns, and 2,275,103 PDES. The BIR plans to complete \nthe encoding in the 11 RDOs and start encoding in the remaining 36 in \n2009. \n(ii) Cleaning corporate taxpayers database\u2014partially accomplished \nand ongoing. Some progress was made in cleaning the corporate \ntaxpayers' database in 2008 and this remains ongoing. Under the \nDPSP subprogram 2, the BIR had identified 125,563 inactive taxpayers \nin the registry (taxpayers who had not filed an income return for the last \n3 years) and 9,429 SEC-registered corporations not registered with the \nBIR. Under subprogram 3 these will be validated as part of cleaning the \ntax registration database; inactive corporations and duplications will be \nremoved, and unregistered corporations registered and penalized). The \nBIR contracted a civil society organization to undertake this activity \nunder the World Bank tax administration reform project. As of \nSeptember 2008, only about 47% of the corporations had been \nvalidated by the CSO. About 10% (or 6,956) were reported as \noperational, 68% nonexistent, and 17% had invalid addresses. With a \nlimited budget to carry out the activity (less than P50 per validation, \nwhich required transport to the identified address, verification that the \ntaxpayer still resides at the address, photographs as evidence of the \nfield visit, and a copy of the barangay certificate of premises) the \ncontract was incomplete, with only 47% of corporations validated. The \nBIR instructed RDOs to complete the validation and cleaning process \nbut progress has been slow since then. In hindsight, it would have \nbeen more effective if the activity started with the 9,429 SEC registered \ncorporations, since this is where the biggest gains in tax collection are \nlikely.    \n5. Forward estimates produced by  5. Accomplished. The Government updated and produced forward \nDBM staff with increasing  estimates for all line ministries for the 2009 budget.

It intends to arrange for an MOU with the \nBureau of Treasury (DOF) and COA to establish a task force for \ndeveloping an action plan under the post-program monitoring \nframework. ADB is providing technical assistance to the DBM on the \nGFMIS action plan.  \n7. National guidelines for internal  7. Accomplished. Guidelines for internal control systems produced, \ncontrol standards formulated and  printed and disseminated to agencies, GOCCs, and LGUs.

In anticipation of the approval of \nthe plan, the 2009 national government budget allocated an additional \nP1.0 billion to the BIR for new technical positions; about 3,000 new \npositions nationwide will be funded under this additional budget. Under \nMCC assistance, which was completed in December 2008, BIR staff \nwere trained in tax evasion investigations, toolkits were provided and \nguidelines were produced.  \n9. Ensure all publicly bid opportunities  9.  Substantially accomplished.  Progress has been made in the \nand awards of central offices of the  PhilGEPS second year of operation in raising levels of compliance with \n12 GPPB member departments plus  the 2003 law on procurement (RA 9184): (i) all 12 GPPB member \nthree non-GPPB members (DA,  agencies have posted bid opportunities and award notices, compared \nDSWD, DENR) posted on PhilGEPS  with 9 in 2007; (ii) 9 of the 12 GPPB member agencies increased of the \nin compliance with RA 9184.  number of bid notices posted in 2008, compared with 2007, and 8 out \nof 12 agencies posted more award notices in 2008 than they did in \n2007; and (iii) progress was made in expanding outreach to non-GPPB \nmembers with the Department of Agriculture, DSWD, DENR and BIR \nall posting some bid notices and awards on PhilGEPS for the first time \nin 2008.  \n10.

NEDA's job was made harder as its mandate as chair of the \nRIA working group under the National Competitiveness Council was to \ndevelop a strategic framework for the RIA. It did not have a legal \nmandate to implement or advocate RIA implementation in other line \nministries Thus, the first step of NEDA's new mandate will be to \nadvocate RIA, build support for it, develop capacity to implement the \nRIA, and to facilitate the design and development of an RIA action plan \nand timeframe for its implementation.  \n12.

Introduction \n \n1.  To support implementation of the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP), the \nGovernment of the Philippines requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide policy \nand advisory technical assistance (TA). This TA is the second of a series of three TA projects to \nsupport the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and Department of Finance (Debt \nand  Risk  Management  Division,  DRMD)  and  Bureau  of  Treasury  in  implementing  and \nmonitoring  key  public  financial  management  reforms  with  a  focus  on  enhancing  cash \nmanagement, budget execution, accounting, recording, and reporting and to strengthen debt \nmanagement systems. The first TA project laid out the building blocks for developing an action \nplan and implementation timeframe for an integrated government financial management system \n(GFMIS), provided assistance for the piloting of an internal control system, and other related \nareas in budget execution. The second TA project builds on the GFMIS and focuses on the \nimplementing budget execution reforms needed for an integrated GFMIS, assistance for better \ncash revenue forecasting; capacity development support for the newly established debt and risk \nmanagement division; and a rollout of internal control system at the national level. All supporting \nmeasures have been agreed as part of the post-program monitoring framework. The third TA \nproject will build on activities under the second TA project, including an integrated GFMIS, \nrollout  of  internal  control  systems,  debt  management  and  cash  revenue  forecasting.  It  is \nintended that at the end of the series of TA projects, the DBM will be in a position to have a \nlong-term public financial management reform strategy and to fund the implementation of an \nintegrated  GFMIS  (Figure  A8).  The  scope  of  the  TA  parallels  the  DPSP,  covering  the \ngovernance and public financial management component, and impact and outcomes listed in \nthe design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Issues \n \n2.  Medium-term  sustainable  priority  spending  requires  more  efficient  public  financial \nmanagement. The key challenges for the Government are to strengthen cash management \npractices at the Bureau of Treasury, balance the public expenditure program between capital \nspending and recurrent expenditures, as well as between discretionary and nondiscretionary \nspending  items  (local  government  unit  transfers,  wages,  and  interest  payments);  and  to \nimplement  improved  public  financial  management  systems,  including  those  on  debt \nmanagement. The key public financial management issues were comprehensively discussed in \nthe main text of the RRP (paras. 22\u201328). This section briefly notes the key issues that are or will \nbe addressed by the three TA projects.  \n \n3.  Debt management. The debt management systems at the DOF are fragmented, with \nseparate units at the Bureau of Treasury, Corporate Affairs (covering contingent liabilities of \ngovernment-owned  and  controlled  corporations  and  others),  and  the  International  Finance \nGroup  (covering  official  development  assistance  and  international  commercial  borrowings). \nMonitoring of contingent liabilities under the build\u2013operate\u2013transfer law is done through the \nNEDA  Infrastructure  Coordination  Committee.  Consequently,  debt  management  is  not \nconducted within an integrated debt framework as suggested by best international practice. \nThere is no integrated debt management strategy and debt sustainability assessments do not \naccompany the proposed budget plan. The software is outdated, although the DOF does plan to \nupgrade its system. Under subprogram 3, the DOF approved the establishment of the DRMD, \nwhich will function as a middle office to undertake public debt policy formulation and analysis. \nCapacity development of the division requires longer-term support in the form of staff training \n ", "Appendix 8  71\nand policy advisory assistance to develop a debt management strategy and to carry out public \ndebt  analysis  and  a  bi-semester  debt  sustainability  assessment.  Under  the  post-program \nmonitoring  framework,  it  is  anticipated  that  the  DRMD  will  formulate  a  debt  management \nstrategy in 2010. The second TA project will support this effort. \n \n4.  Budget execution and controls. There are several gaps in budget execution that need \nto be addressed in the short and long terms. These include weaknesses in recording and \nmanagement of cash balances, as more than one treasury account makes reconciling balances \ndifficult. The monthly (and even daily) cash forecasting capabilities of the Bureau of Treasury \nare limited and are not integrated with the revenue forecasts made by the BIR. Current reporting \narrangements  make  it  difficult  to  reconcile  the  budget  allocation  releases  and  actual \nexpenditures incurred by agencies because of differences in accounting formats used by the \nDBM and the chart of accounts used by the Commission of Audit (COA). \n \n5.  Internal controls system. Development of internal control and internal audit systems in \nspending agencies is an essential element of budget execution and financial reporting. There \nare weaknesses in payroll controls and internal controls for nonsalary expenditures and a lack \nof  independent,  internal  audits  within  line  ministries.  Until  recently,  there  have  been  no \nguidelines for internal control systems for line agencies to follow and not all agencies have \nestablished independent internal audit units. With assistance from the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development (AusAID), the DBM has produced internal control guidelines and \npiloted  them  in  two  ministries.  ADB  supporting  two  additional  pilots  at  the  Department  of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources (DENR) and the Department of Labor and Employment \n(DOLE). The Government intends to complete the rollout of internal control systems to national \nagencies over the next 3 years.  \n \n6.  Budget accounting, recording, and reporting.  Accounts reconciliation, in-year budget \nreports on obligations, cash releases and allotments, obligations, and disbursements are not \ndone on time, and thus do not allow effective tracking of budget efficiency indicators. The key \nunderlying cause of weaknesses in budget execution, recording, and reporting is the absence of \nan  integrated  government  financial  management  information  system  (GFMIS).  The  current \nmanual recording of accounts payable results in frequent reporting delays from line ministries \nand regions to the DBM. With assistance from the US Trade and Development Agency, the \nGovernment has completed an analysis of the GFMIS at the DBM and line ministries, and \nprovided a tentative costing of rolling out an integrated GFMIS nationally.  The DBM has also \nbegun consultations with stakeholders and development partners on a strategy for the future. It \nis important for the key agencies\u2014COA, DBM and DOF\u2014to establish a consensus on a way \nforward for integrating the fragmented GFMIS. This will require a formal coordinated effort by \nkey government agencies, with longer- term support from development partners. ADB technical \nassistance is being provided to the DBM to support it in developing a GFMIS road map with \nclear targets and monitoring. This reform is included in the post-program monitoring framework. \n \nC.  Development Partners'  Coordination \n \n7.  The TA supports a core element of the Government\u2019s public financial management \nreform agenda. Under the DPSP cluster the Government is committed to (i) rolling out the \nMTEF, (ii) initiating development of the GFMIS, (iii) piloting and then rolling out internal control \nand audit to national line agencies, and (iv) enhancing budget transparency and reporting. The \nDOF has issued a department order establishing the DRMD, which will oversee development of \nthe debt management strategy and policies related to debt management such as guidelines on \ndebt tenures. The TA complements another ADB TA on enhancing tax revenue collection, \n ", "72  Appendix 8 \nincluding  providing  assistance  to  upgrade  the  revenue-forecasting  capabilities  at  the \nDepartment  of  Finance.  It  also  complements  the  activities  of  other  development  partners, \nincluding AusAID and the World Bank. AusAID has a large grant assisting the DBM with the \ncomputation  of  forward  estimates  under  the  MTEF  and  development  of  guidelines  for  the \ninternal control systems. These initiatives are being piloted at the DepEd and the DPWH. The \nICS will be piloted in DSWD. A small World Bank grant is supporting the drafting of the DBM\u2019s \nbudget strategy paper and the Public Expenditure Accountability Financial (PEFA) report. ADB \nhas worked closely with other development partners in preparing the TA, and will continue to do \nso during implementation. ADB is collaborating with AusAID on the internal control systems and \nit will pilot the internal control systems at DOLE and the DENR. Informally, the development \npartners have agreed that AusAID will coordinate the activities of the development partners and \ndisseminate information on public financial management activities and issues identification.   \n \n2.  Technical Assistance \na.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will support the DPSP cluster by (i) enhancing cash management practices, \nbudget execution, accounting, recording, and reporting; (ii) initiating the development of an \nintegrated GFMIS; and (iii) strengthening debt management practices. \n \n9.  The impacts of the TA will be an enhanced public financial management system with \nbetter budget transparency and efficiency. Over the longer term, these reforms will improve the \nsustainability of priority spending.    \n \nb.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The key TA activities are divided into three components: \n \n11.  Implement public expenditure management reforms. This component will support the \nDBM and the Bureau of Treasury with budget execution reforms. Activities include assistance to \nthe  Bureau  of  Treasury  to  strengthen  cash  management  practices  and  cash  forecasting, \nassistance to the DBM to streamline budget execution procedures; and support for the rollout of \ninternal control systems, starting with a pilot in 2009 and a full rollout in 2010 and 2011. The \ncomponent will fund training in improving budget execution.  \n \n12.  Develop a government financial management information system. This component \nwill build on the results of diagnostic work on a GFMIS that will be undertaken by DBM in 2008 \nand 2009. It will support the activities of the interagency task force on the integrated GFMIS, \nincluding the design and implementation of a road map for developing an integrated GFMIS \nwithin the national government.  \n \n13.  Debt management practices. This component will assist the newly created DRMD with \ncapacity development. It will (i) assist with development of a debt management strategy and \npolicies; (ii) sketch out a longer-term capacity development program for an integrated debt \nmanagement office; and (iii) provide training to staff of the DRMD.  \n \n \n \n \n ", " \n \n  Figure A8: Public Financial Management Systems, Philippines \n \n \nCentral to country system of \n  Supports Aggregate Fiscal Discipline  governance and accountability \n  Strategic Allocation of Resources  Underpin Poverty Reduction \n  Effective Service Delivery Strategies\n \n \n  Budget Planning  Budget Execution Accounting and Reporting External Scrutiny andAudit\n \n \n- Strategic Policy Objectives and  - Treasury and Cash  - Chart of Accounts and  - Oversight by Supreme Audit \n    Planning  Management  Budget Classification  Institution \nPEFA  - Macro Forecasting and Fiscal  - Payroll and Human   System  - Legislative Review and \n \nPrinciples  Envelope  - Resource Management  - Accounting Standards  scrutiny \n  - MTEF  - Procurement  - Debt and Aid  - Civil Society Monitoring \n  - Annual Budget  - Management control and  Management  - Procurement Watch \n- Revenue Management  Internal Audit  - GIFMIS \n \n- Debt Management Strategy   \n \n \n  - The Commission on Audit (COA) \n  - Paper on Budget Strategy  - Cutting edge procurement reform  - Chart of Accounts set by  constitutionally independent \n(PBS), MTEF rolling out, and  law with PHILGEPS implemented  COA  - Annual Audit Reports for FY1998 to FY2008 \n    forward estimates used for  to enhance transparency and  - Accounting Statement  published \n  Philippines  FY 2008/9/10 Budgets  competition  format set by DBM  - Institutionalizing anticorruption programs at \nKey \n  - Organizational Performance  - Internal control systems guidelines  BIR and BOC underway. \nReforms \nIndicator Framework (OPIF)  produced and 2 internal control  - Large CS) community and the Procurement \n \nimplemented  systems pilots (DepEd and  Transparency Group established under the law \n  - PFM Manual Developed  DPWH)  monitor procurement \n- Rationalization Program underway \n \n \n \n- Prosecution and \n  - Budget process characterized by  - Procurement management and  - Implementation of Rationalization Plan slow  enforcement of tax \n  significant degree of executive  financial Management weak in key  - Accounting and Financial Statements are not fully  evasion continues to \n    Weakness  - paBpruepdrrogogepatr itianivtteieo gnarsna dti osnp encoita fl uplluyr pose  - siInnptteeernrnndaainll  gac uoadngitter oinnlc  seieyassr tl ey mstsa gaensd  of  - cCSocOmoApp eare nthode  iDnmsBpivMroe,v  aen edf fbeectttiveer  hcaoromrdoinniazteio Cn hbaerttw oef en  - bgDoeev mae arcnnhadan-llsceiend geme e asures          A\nachieved  enhancement  Accounts wth DBM accounting and budget reports  outpaces supply-side  p\n  p\n- Debt Management Strategy not  - Enormous scope for IT-based PFM system  bottlenecks  e\n  formulated  nd\n    TA-2: Focus on implementing budget execution reforms  TA-3: continue implementing budget execution  ix 8\nAtaesDcshBisn tiacnacl e   TimAp-l1e:m beunildtaintigo nb ltoimckesfr afomr ed efovre laonp iinngte agnra atecdtio GnF pMlaInS ,a nd  nrDeeRvceMensDus;ea r rfoyol lrfoeoucr taa osnft  iiinnngttee; rgcnaraaplt aeccdoi tnGyt rFdoMelsvI eSsly,o sipmtempmero navtt i sntuhgpe cp naoasrhtti o ant athl e  rtohetehfo eprrmi lloisnt  euo nfm dGienFris MTtrIAiSe- s2a;, t c pDoroBmvMpidl eeat niaoddn ve oivsfeo rnroytlu losauul ptr opolofl orintu tfteo trron  al  7         \nfor PFM  parileoati ning  bthued ginette ernxaelc cuotinotnro. l system, and other related  lpeovsetl-,p arongdr saump pmoortninitgo rminega fsraumreesw aogrrke. ed as part of the  creofnotrrmols s iydsetnetmifise,d d uenbdt emr aTnAa-g2e. m  ent, and other   73  3  ", "74  Appendix 8 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COA = Commission on Audit, DBM = Department of Budget and Management,  \nDepED = Department of Education, DPWH = Department of Public Works and Highways, DRMD = debt and risk \nmanagement division, GFMIS = government financial management information system, OPIF =  organizational \nperformance indicator framework , PEFA = Public Expenditure Financial Accountability, PHILGEPS = Philippine \nGovernment Electric Procurement System, PBS = Paper on Budget Strategy, PFM = public financial management, \nTA = technical assistance. \n  3.

The DBM will be the executing agency, as it is responsible for national budget execution. \nThe DOF will be an implementing agency. The DBM chairs the interagency task force on \ndevelopment of an integrated GFMIS, with the COA and the DOF as members. The DBM will \nprovide office space, counterpart staff, and other services to the consultants and it will closely \ncoordinate  with  line  ministries  and  agencies  and  other  stakeholders  involved  in  TA \nimplementation. The TA will begin in the first quarter of 2010 and be completed in the third \nquarter of 2011. The equipment and software will be procured in accordance with the ADB \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and the Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.5 The equipment and software will be handed over to the DBM and the \nDRMD upon completion of the TA.  \n \n16.  A team of international and national consultants will implement the TA. ADB will engage \na combination of a consulting firm and individuals in accordance with the Guidelines on Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The firm will be engaged following quality- \nand cost-based selection (80:20 quality\u2013cost ratio) using a simplified technical proposal. A total \nof 51 person-months of consulting services will be required (18 international and 33 national).  \n \n17.  The consultants will provide regular written reports in English: (i) an inception report, \nincluding a comprehensive implementation plan, will be submitted within 4 weeks after the TA \nstarts; (ii) an interim report; (iii) progress reports; and (iv) a draft final report and, subsequently, \na final report to be submitted before the TA ends.
