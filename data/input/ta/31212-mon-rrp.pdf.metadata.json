A technical assistance (TA)\ngrant of $695,000 equivalent will be provided upon approval of\nthe ASDP.\nRationale Although  the  agriculture  sector,  in  particular  the  extensive\nlivestock subsector, has been the mainstay of the Mongolian\npopulation  during  the  recent  difficult  years  of  the  economic\ntransformation, a number of factors continue to undermine its\nperformance.  This  is  despite  the  adoption  of  major  market\nreforms  including  privatization,  deregulation  of  prices  of\nagricultural  products,  and  liberalization  of  agricultural  trade,\nwhich were supported by the ADB-financed Agriculture Sector\nProgram  implemented  during  1995-1998.  Many  of  the  new\nowners in the agriculture sector have little knowledge on how to\nmanage their assets in a market economy. The supply of critical\nsupport  services,  previously  organized  and  controlled  by  the\nstate, has deteriorated and left a vacuum that has not yet been\nadequately  filled  by  the  private  sector.  The  financial  sector\ncontinues to be restructured, but so far is providing very little\nlending in rural areas. Due to the limited availability of support\nservices and other inputs, agricultural productivity is very low. In\nthe  livestock  subsector,  the  problem  is  intensified  by  the\novergrazing  of  many  pastures  as  a  result  of  the  substantial\nincrease  in  the  national  herd,  and  the  large  number  of\ninoperative stock-watering wells.\nClosely related to the problem of low productivity is the lack of\nmarketing channels needed to increase incentives for agricultural\nactivity. The restructuring of marketing and the privatization of\nprocessing  enterprises  proceeded  much  slower  than  that  of\nlivestock  collectives  and  state  farms.  With  the  collapse  of\ntraditional export markets and the reduction of subsidies, many\nagricultural  processing  plants  have  been  closed,  and  the\nremaining are operating with low capacity. The entry of private\ntrading and processing enterprises has been slow due to the lack\nof  investment  and  working  capital.  Partly  because  of  market\nlogistics  and  low  monetization  in  rural  areas,  subsistence\nproduction  and  barter  transaction  are  common.  Due  to  poor\ncommunication channels, many agricultural producers have little\naccess to market and other information. The cooperative system,\nwhich offers the most promising avenue for the provision\nof marketing and other services in rural areas as well as for the", "iii\ndelivery  of  local  public  goods  and  collective  income-earning\nactivities, requires support to fulfill its potential institutional role.\nThe ASDP will address these two main problem areas, i.e. low\nproductivity and limited marketing channels, and the resulting\nconstraints on income-earning opportunities in rural areas. It will\ncomprise a policy loan for deepening and refining the policy and\nlegal framework for agriculture, and an investment loan providing\nsupport services for production and marketing, as well as credit.\nClassification Primary : Economic growth\nSecondary: Poverty reduction\nEnvironmental Category B.\nAssessment Environmental implications of the policy and institutional reforms\nwere  reviewed,  and  environmental  interventions  have  been\nincorporated, as required. An initial environmental examination\nfor the components under the investment loan was undertaken,\nand no significant negative effects were identified.\nThe Sector Development Program\nObjectives The sector goals are to develop a more market-oriented, efficient\nand Scope and  sustainable  agriculture  sector  and  reduce  poverty  by\nproviding increased income opportunities. The specific purpose\nis  to  increase  productivity  and  profitability  of  agricultural\nproducers.\nThe  ASDP  will  include  both  direct  and  indirect  poverty\ninterventions. Poor people are expected to comprise at least one\nthird of the beneficiaries. The emphasis on poverty reduction is\nin line with the country operational strategy for Mongolia and the\nPartnership Agreement with the Asian Development Bank (ADB),\nand with the Government's Action Plan.\nThe ASDP will consist of a policy program with seven policy\nareas,  and  an  investment  Project  with  three  components.\nAssociated  with  the  ASDP  will  be  advisory  TA  for  Capacity\nBuilding in Agriculture.\nPolicy Framework The ASDP is designed as a follow-up to the Agriculture Sector\nand Actions Program.  With  the  broad  framework  for  market-based\ndevelopment of agriculture in place, the ASDP policy program\nwill support second generation reforms to deepen, refine, and\nmore extensively implement the policy and legal framework for\nagriculture. The emphasis is on focusing the Government's role\non providing essential support services, and creating a favorable\nenvironment for the private sector to more effectively undertake\nfunctions that during the pretransition period were carried out  by   ", "iv\nthe  state,  such  as  the  supply  of  inputs,  the  processing  and\nmarketing of outputs, and the provision of financial services.\nThe policy program focuses on providing support to (i) reduce\nprice and other distortions to improve resource allocation and\nefficiency  in  the  agriculture  sector;  (ii)  promote  competitive\nmarkets for agricultural inputs, outputs, and processed goods;\n(iii)  ensure  the  delivery  of  financial  services  and  provide\nimproved access to credit for the rural population; (iv) rationalize\ntax incentives to promote investment in rural areas; (v) improve\nproductivity and sustainability in extensive livestock production;\n(vi) strengthen agricultural research and extension to support\nprivate sector agriculture; and (vii) mitigate risks in agriculture\nand ensure food security, income and employment for vulnerable\ngroups.\nCapacity Building Capacity building is included in each of  the  components  of  the\ninvestment Project.\nThe Investment Linked closely to the policy program, the investment Project will\nProject focus  on  delivering  an  integrated  package  of  critical  support\nservices to help increase income by improving productivity and\nprofitability  in  the  crop  and  livestock  subsectors.  The  project\ndesign has also been guided by the need for medium- to long-\nterm measures to help reduce the vulnerability of the agriculture\nsector to natural disasters.\nThe Project has three components with several subcomponents.\nThe  production  and  marketing  support  component  includes\nassistance for (i) expanding small-scale horticulture production\namong vulnerable groups under the Green Revolution Program;\n(ii) strengthening veterinary services; (iii) rehabilitating wells in\npasture areas; (iv) developing the cooperative system to provide\nbetter  marketing  and  processing  services  to  agricultural\nproducers; and (v) improving rural communication links, including\ntelephone and radio services. The credit component comprises\nsupport for (i) a credit line for participating financial institutions\n(PFIs)  to  increase  the  availability  of  credit  for  agricultural\npurposes, and (ii) capacity building for PFI staff and advice to\npotential  subborrowers.  The  project  management  component\nincludes  support  for  the  efficient  management  of  project\nactivities.\nThe production and marketing support component will focus on\nfour provinces in the relatively remote and poor western region of\nMongolia:  Dzavhan,  Hovd,  Gobialtay,  and  Urs.  The  credit\ncomponent will cover these provinces and, in addition, the north-\ncentral provinces of Darhan-Uul and Selenge, which comprise\nthe country's most important wheat producing area. The Project\nwill be implemented over five years.", "v\nSocial and Social and environmental assessments indicated that none of\nEnvironmental the ASDP elements are expected to have a significant adverse\nIssues impact on the poor, or on the environment. The closely linked\npolicy  actions  and  investments  in  the  areas  of  small-scale\nvegetable production, cooperative development, and rural credit\nprovision will directly benefit households with small herds, which\nconstitute the majority of the poor in rural areas. Support for\nimproved pasture management and well rehabilitation to reduce\nthe  pressure  on  overgrazed  areas  will  have  significant\nenvironmental benefits.\nThe Policy Loan\nLoan Amount A loan of $7.0 million equivalent is proposed from the Special\nand Terms Funds resources of ADB in support of the policy program. The\nloan will have a maturity of 24 years, including a grace period of\n8 years. Interest will be charged at 1 percent per annum during\nthe grace period, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nProgram Period The  loan  will  be  used  over  four  years  from  the  date  of  loan\nand Tranching effectiveness.  The  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  two  equal\ntranches of $3.5 million equivalent. Release of the first tranche will\nbe  subject  to  loan  effectiveness.  The  second  tranche  will  be\nreleased when nine conditions are met, approximately two years\nafter the release of the first tranche.\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE)\nProcurement The  proceeds  of  the  policy  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the\nforeign exchange cost of items produced in and procured from\nADB's member countries (other than those items specified in a\nnegative  list  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and\nmultilateral sources). Procurement of eligible items will be on the\nbasis of normal commercial practices for procurement by the\nprivate sector or standard Government procedures acceptable to\nADB for procurement by the public sector. However for goods\ncommonly  traded  on  international  commodity  markets,\nprocurement will be undertaken in accordance with procedures\nappropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.\nCounterpart Funds The counterpart funds will be used to support the costs of the\npolicy program. Any counterpart funds not required for the policy\nprogram will be used first to finance local currency costs of other\nADB-financed  projects  and,  second,  for  general  development\npurposes.\nThe Investment Loan\nLoan Amount The total project cost is $13.1 million equivalent. The proposed\nand Terms ADB loan is for $10.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds\nresources. The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a", "vi\ngrace period of 8 years. Interest will be charged at 1 percent per\nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.\nImplementation The  Executing  Agency  for  the  investment  loan  will  be  the\nArrangements and Ministry  of  Food  and  Agriculture  (MFA).  To  ensure  effective\nExecuting Agency implementation,  a  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  deputy\nminister  of  finance  and  economy  will  be  created.  Project\nimplementation agreements will be executed between MFA and\nthe  four  western  provinces.  For  the  implementation  of  the\nsubcomponent  on  rural  communication  links,  a  joint  order\nbetween MFA and the Ministry of Infrastructure will be executed,\nand for the implementation of the subcomponent on capacity\nbuilding for PFI staff and subborrowers, a joint order between\nMFA and MFE will be executed. In addition, Bank of Mongolia\nwill enter into subsidiary loan agreements with PFIs.\nProcurement All procurement will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on\nand Consulting Procurement. Procurement of equipment, vehicles, and furniture\nServices will  be  awarded  based  on  international  shopping  or  local\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Small\ncontracts valued at less than $100,000 equivalent each may be\nawarded on the basis of direct purchase. Consulting services\ninclude  46  person-months  of  international  and  392  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting,  a  training  contract,  and  two\nservice contracts. International consultants will be provided by a\nfirm  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. Domestic consultants will be recruited by the firm in\naccordance with procedures acceptable to ADB.\nTime Frame The investment Project will be implemented over five years with\ncompletion expected by 31 March 2006.\nTechnical Assistance An advisory TA grant of $695,000 equivalent will support Capacity\nBuilding  in  Agriculture.  The  TA  will  provide  training  for\ncooperatives,  and  facilitate  more  sustainable  pasture\nmanagement in the four western provinces. Consulting services\ninclude 15 person-months of international and 145 person-months\nof domestic consulting. The TA is proposed to be financed from\nthe Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan.\nRisks and Safeguards The Government is committed to the policy measures supported\nby the ASDP. A potential risk to the policy program is a delay in\nimplementing  some  of  the  policy  actions  due  to  institutional\nweaknesses or economic uncertainties. Safeguards include the\nsetting of a period of two years between the first and second\ntranches, and another period of two years between the second\ntranche and the end of the program to give adequate time for the\ncompletion of the policy reforms. In addition, many of the policy\nactions  are  closely  linked  to  activities  under  the  Project  and\nassociated  TA,  so  that  support  is  indirectly  provided  for", "vii\nimplementing the policy measures.\nA potential risk for the investment Project involves the provision\nof  adequate  counterpart  financing.  The  Government  requires\nassistance to address the budget\u2019s structural problems, which\nare  at  the  heart  of  the  current  budget  imbalance  and  cash\nshortage. The Governance Reform Program approved by ADB in\n1999  will  contribute  to  improving  public  expenditure\nmanagement.\nA potential risk to the credit component is the faltering of the\nongoing financial sector and banking reform. The Government is\ncommitted to continuing the reforms and ensuring the necessary\nframework to allow for the expansion of lending services in rural\nareas. The ADB-financed Second Financial Sector Program in\ncoordination  with  the  World  Bank-financed  Financial  Sector\nAdjustment Credit, both approved in 2000, will help mitigate the\nrisk of faltering financial sector and banking reforms. The credit\ncomponent is designed to allow flexibility for PFIs: any financial\ninstitution  will  be  able  to  participate  as  long  as  it  meets  the\neligibility criteria.\nThe successful implementation of the Project will also depend on\nthe  capacity  of  the  agricultural  agencies  at  the  national,\nprovincial, and district levels. Most subcomponents of the Project\ncomprise capacity building and training activities. In addition, the\nproject management component includes assistance to MFA to\nimprove monitoring and evaluation systems.", "viii", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on two proposed\nloans to Mongolia for the Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP). The report also\ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building in Agriculture, and if the\nproposed loans are approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the\nBoard, shall approve the TA.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. In response to a Government request, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been\nconsidering a follow-up loan to the Agriculture Sector Program (ASP)1 implemented during\n1995-1998.2 A feasibility study3 conducted from October to December 1997 helped focus the\nASDP to (i) continue policy and institutional reform, (ii) increase the effectiveness of the former\nMinistry of Agriculture and Industry and local governments in agriculture development, (iii)\npromote rehabilitation and investment in the agriculture sector, and (iv) improve and increase\nagricultural production in a sustainable manner. In June and July 1999 and October 1999 an\nagricultural policy consultant was fielded to improve the policy agenda. The loan Fact-Finding\nMission was fielded in January-February 2000, followed by the Loan Preappraisal Mission in\nMarch-April 2000 which was subsequently upgraded to appraisal status. Following the elections\nin July 2000, a Project-specific Consultation Mission4 was fielded in September-October 2000 to\nconfirm the new Government\u2019s support for the ASDP.\n3. This report is based on the consultants' studies and ADB staff field visits and discussions\nwith representatives of national, provincial, and district government agencies, herder and farmer\nhouseholds,  cooperatives  and  other  agricultural  associations,  the  private  sector,  potential\nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs), and external funding agencies. In particular, close\ncoordination was sought with the International Monetary Fund to ensure that the policy matrix of\nthe ASDP is consistent with ongoing Fund discussions. The program framework is presented in\nAppendix 1.\nIII. THE SECTOR\nA. Macroeconomic Context\n4. Since the beginning of the transition in 1990, Mongolia has made great progress in\ndeveloping a democratic form of government and a market-based economic system. During the\nfirst four years of adjustment, the economy contracted sharply due to the withdrawal of Soviet\nassistance, equivalent to about 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and the breakup of\nthe trading system with the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.\nThe  collapse  of  the  state  budget  led  to  drastic  cuts  in  subsidies  and  welfare  programs.\nFurthermore, the economic restructuring and privatization process led to a severe retrenchment\nin public sector employment, and to the closure of many nonviable enterprises. Although much\nof the shed labor force was absorbed by the extensive livestock sector, and in part by the\ngrowing  informal  economy,  unemployment  and  poverty  increased  rapidly.  Based  on  the\n                                                          \n1 Loan 1409-MON: Agriculture Sector Program, for $35.0 million, approved on 5 December 1995.\n2 The project completion report, circulated to the Board on 31 May 2000, showed the loan to have been partially\nsuccessful.\n3  TA 2819-MON: Agriculture Sector Development Program, for $492,000, approved on 27 June 1997.\n4  The Project-specific Consultation Mission comprised S.M. Scheierling, Project Economist and Mission Leader; M.\nJayawant, Economist; B.R. Philips, Manager; B.J. Hitchcock, Sr. Programs Officer; P. Gittinger, Agricultural\nEconomics Expert; and A. Wolz, Cooperatives and Social Development Expert; as well as four local experts: S.\nOyunchimeg, B. Burmaa, N. Batjargal, and U. Byambasuren.", "2\nGovernment's income-based poverty line, 26 percent of the population was living below the\nminimum living standard level by 1994.\n5. From 1994 to 1999 the economy recovered with real GDP growth averaging 3.6 percent.\nThe source of growth was primarily a private sector-led recovery in the agriculture sector\nfollowing the privatization of livestock, manufacturing, and services. In 1996 the Government\nadopted  an  ambitious  reform  program  to  complete  the  transition  to  a  market  economy,\naccelerate growth, and reduce poverty. Key elements of the program included reducing inflation,\nliberalizing prices, streamlining the public sector, developing the private sector, and establishing\na social safety net. As a result, private sector activity increased sharply and exports grew as\nterms of trade improved in 1997. The exchange rate stabilized, and inflation fell from 47 percent\nin 1996 to 20 percent in 1997. In 1997, Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization, and most\nimport taxes were abolished.\n6. In 1998 the terms of trade deteriorated resulting in lower tax revenues and undermining\nbank loan portfolios, thus contributing to severe problems in the banking system. In addition, the\neconomy was affected by the financial crisis in the Asian countries and the Russian Federation.\nPolitical uncertainty, resulting in two changes of government, undermined Mongolia's capacity to\nrespond to these external changes. The fiscal deficit widened to 12 percent of GDP, from 9\npercent in 1997, and the togrog (MNT) depreciated by 11 percent against the dollar. Despite\nthese external shocks and political crises, the economy continued to grow and inflation declined\nto 6 percent. But the number of households living below the poverty line remained almost\nunchanged,5 suggesting increasingly inequitable growth.\n7. In 1999, economic growth was sustained at 3.5 percent, and income per capita reached\nan estimated $435. Mainly due to a disruption of oil supplies from the Russian Federation and\nincreasing world market prices for petroleum products, inflation picked up and reached 10\npercent at the end of the year. The exchange rate depreciated by 19 percent, thus contributing\nto a reduction in the trade balance deficit from 15 percent of GDP in 1998 to 9 percent in 1999.\nFiscal performance improved in 1999 as a result of a package of revenue measures. The\nexternal imbalance and the budget deficit were increasingly met by external borrowings at long-\nterm, concessional rates. By the end of 1999, the external dept had grown to 78 percent of\nGDP, and official development assistance contributed about 30 percent of the budget.\n8. According to the Action Plan of the new Government, which came into power in July\n2000, the economic policy during the next four years will focus on continuing and deepening\neconomic reform and accelerating growth. This includes ensuring macroeconomic stability;\nsetting up a sound banking system  and financial sector; continuing the privatization process\nand  improving  its  efficiency;  restoring  domestic  industries  including  the  crop  industry,  and\npromoting  export,  in  particular  in  the  areas  of  livestock  raw  materials;  and  developing\ninfrastructure.\n9. Major  achievements  in  macroeconomic  management  during  the  second  half  of  the\n1990s include the control of inflation and continued growth, however some uncertainty remains\nfor the country's short- to medium-term economic prospects. The dependence of the economy\non the exports of a few primary commodities, such as copper, gold, and cashmere, makes the\ncountry vulnerable to external shocks and contributes to the weakness of the external account.\nThe extremely harsh winter of 1999/2000 resulted in the loss of about 8 percent of Mongolia's\nlivestock, which may have far-reaching implications for growth and poverty reduction in the\n                                                          \n5 According to the Government's income-based poverty line, 26 percent of the population were living below the\npoverty line in 1998. Living standards measurement surveys carried out in 1995 and 1998 estimated that in both\nyears about 36 percent of the population were living below an expenditure-based poverty line.", "3\ncoming years. Tax revenue collection needs to be improved to strengthen the fiscal position,\nand direct foreign investment encouraged. The banking system continues to be relatively weak,\nand  the  range  of  available  financial  services  narrow.  This  is  constraining  private  sector\ndevelopment and growth, including in the agriculture sector.\nB. Sector Description and Recent Performance\n1. Overview\n10. Agriculture is the mainstay of Mongolia's 2.4 million people and contributes a third of\nGDP. Agricultural and agroprocessed exports amount to about one third of foreign exchange\nearnings. Agriculture is the source of employment for almost half of the population, and the most\nimportant source of household income in rural areas. Extensive livestock production is by far the\ndominant agricultural activity. Close to 80 percent of the country's total land area, or 128 million\nhectares (ha), is pasture land. The remaining 20 percent is considered inaccessible due to\nmountain terrain or desert, or due to lack of water. Less than 1 percent of the land area, or 1.3\nmillion ha, is considered arable. The continental climate with a short growing season, sharply\ndefined seasons, mean annual temperatures between \u20136o and +4o Celsius, low precipitation,\nand high evapotranspiration are the overriding constraints of Mongolian agriculture, and are\ncontributing factors to relatively fragile ecosystems.\n11. Mongolia's agriculture sector comprises (i) a livestock subsector, consisting mainly of\nextensive livestock production based on the seasonal migration of mixed herds of sheep, goats,\ncattle, horses, and camels; and some intensive livestock production with housed dairy cattle,\npigs, and poultry; and (ii) a crop subsector concentrated on the production of wheat, the main\nstaple food. Crop production mostly takes place on relatively large, extensively managed and\nmechanized  farms  in  the  north-central  region  around  Ulaanbaatar.  Horticulture  production\ncomprises mostly potato and vegetables, and is increasingly based on small family plots and\nsome commercial greenhouses.\n12. The transition process had a dramatic impact on agriculture. With the removal of the\nsupport structure previously provided by the state, the agriculture sector contracted sharply in\nthe early 1990s. However, by 1995 it had recovered to its 1989 level in real terms, and in 1998 it\nwas 14 percent above this. In contrast, GDP in 1995 was only 84 percent, and in 1998, 93\npercent of its 1989 level in real terms (Appendix 2, Table A2.1). The relatively quick restoration\nof agricultural output helped to prevent a far worse economic contraction in the initial years of\nadjustment. In current prices, agriculture accounted for 15 percent of GDP in 1989. Agriculture's\nshare rose to 37 percent in 1994, the first year of economic recovery. Since then it declined\nslightly to 33 percent in 1998. In real terms, the share of agriculture in GDP varied less\ndramatically, staying at around 37 percent since 1995, compared with 30 percent in 1989.\nWithin agricultural output, the share of the livestock subsector increased from 77 percent in\n1989 to 90 percent in 1999, while the share of the crop subsector declined from 23 percent to\n10 percent. Employment in agriculture rose significantly, from 33 percent of total employment in\n1990 to about half in 1999.\n13. Even though agricultural production and employment increased during the 1990s, the\nlinkages between the agriculture and industry sectors significantly declined. In 1989 more than\nhalf of industrial output was directly based on agriculture. By the end of the decade, this share\nhad decreased, both absolutely (to about 25 percent of its 1989 level) and relatively (to about a\nquarter of the total in 1989).", "4\n2. Crop Subsector\n14. During the late 1980s Mongolia was more than self-sufficient in wheat. For many years\nlarge state subsidies had stimulated the conversion of pasture land to cropped land, including in\nvery marginal areas. In 1989, 530,000 ha was sown with wheat.6 By 1999 this had declined by\nalmost a half to 273,000 ha (Appendix 2, Table A2.2). The areas planted to other crops, such as\npotatoes and fodder, had also declined considerably. As a result, crop output in 1999 was\nsignificantly below 1989 levels. Wheat output was a quarter, and fodder output 1 percent of the\n1989 level. Only potato and vegetable output showed some increase in the last few years.\nAverage yields also declined significantly during the 1990s. Wheat yield fell from 1.3 tons per ha\nin 1989 to 0.6 tons per ha in 1999, although yields varied widely across provinces (from 0.17 ton\nto 1.5 tons per ha) and across farms, with some farms reaching over 2.5 ton per ha.\n15. Poor  seeds  are  a  major  contributing  factor  for  low  yields.  For  several  years,  little\ncommercial seed was available in the market; farmers used farm-saved seed of poor quality and\noutdated varieties. Other factors include exhausted soils, little use of fertilizers or pesticides,\nand failing machinery. While the demand for credit is high, in particular to buy inputs and minor\nequipment at the beginning of the cropping season, little credit has been available for crop\nfarmers over the last few years. The limited expertise of some of the new, private farmers also\nhas contributed to the decline in yields.\n16. By 1999, most of the state farms were fully privatized, with about 80 percent under\nsingle (either individual or company) ownership. There are now about 300 farms with several\nthousand ha and many smaller farms with several hundred ha. An increasing share of vegetable\nproduction is taking place on small plots by households, mostly near urban centers. Vegetables\nare also grown commercially on some of the irrigated land, currently about 4,200 ha.\n17. In the pretransition period, processing of crops largely involved the milling of wheat into\nflour and its use for bread and bakery production; the distilling for alcohol, spirits, and other\nbeverage  manufacture;  and  the  production  of  manufactured  fodder.  During  the  1990s\nprocessing  activities  fell  sharply.  Flour  production  is  now  a  third,  and  bread  and  bakery\nproduction a quarter of their 1989 level. Manufactured fodder in 1998 was at 10 percent of the\n1989 level, largely due to the collapse of intensive livestock production. Only alcohol output has\nrisen above pretransition levels.\n18. Exports of crop products have essentially disappeared, while imports including wheat,\nflour, potatoes, and vegetables are steadily increasing, and now account for about 10 percent of\ntotal imports. The import requirements for wheat in 1999 amounted to more than 50 percent of\nthe  country's  wheat  needs.  During  the  1990s,  wheat  and  flour  imports  have  largely  been\ncommodity aid-funded by the United States (US) and Japan.\n3. Livestock Subsector\na. Privatization and Production\n19. Prior to 1990, pastoral livestock was held within state-controlled collectives (negdels),\neach of which comprised the area of one district. Individual households were allowed to keep a\nsmall number of animals for personal use. The negdels employed herders as salaried workers,\nprovided  the  necessary  supplies  and  technical  advice,  marketed  the  produce,  and  offered\nvarious  social  and  cultural  benefits.  During  the  first  wave  of  privatization  in  1990/91  the\n                                                          \n6 Wheat production is mainly carried out using the monocropping strip system, which involves leaving a significant\nproportion of the land fallow in each year for cropping in the following year.", "5\ncollective herds were distributed to negdel members. Since then total livestock numbers have\nsteadily increased, from 25 million in 1989 to a record of 34 million in 1999, representing an\nincrease of 36 percent (Appendix 2, Table A.2.3). With the increase in livestock numbers herd\ncomposition also changed. Between 1989 and 1999 the number of camels declined by 36\npercent, sheep remained relatively stable, horses increased by 11 percent, cattle increased by\n38 percent, and goats by more than 120 percent to 11 million head. The strong increase in the\nnumber of goats reflects the income opportunities from cashmere.\n20. In  contrast  to  the  extensive  livestock  subsector,  intensive  livestock  production  has\nexperienced a sharp decline. With their reliance on imported high supplement feed, exotic\nspecies, and heated housing during the winter (especially for pigs and poultry, less for dairy\ncows), many production units became unviable with the loss of subsidies.\n21. Processing of livestock products strongly declined during the 1990s. Meat products in\n1999  amounted  to  only  10  percent  of  their  1989  level.  Similar  declines  occurred  in  the\nprocessing of fibers (cashmere, camel hair, and wool) and hides and skins (cattle, horse, goat,\nand sheep). Export of many livestock products also dramatically declined. Meat exports fell from\n30,500 tons in 1989 to 2,200 tons in 1995, and then recovered to 7,500 tons in 1999. However,\nexport of unprocessed cashmere, and hides and skins in raw form continues to do well.\nb. Livestock Disaster During the Severe Winter\n22. The continuous increase in livestock numbers over a favorable climatic period during the\n1990s came to a dramatic halt in the winter of 1999/2000. Following an unusually dry summer,\nthe winter of 1999/2000 was very harsh. Early and heavy snowfall in September-October 1999\ncontinued to build up and denied livestock access to limited forage. Weakened by starvation,\nabout 2.7 million livestock or 8 percent of the total stock did not survive the cold. An estimated\n50,000 households were affected by livestock losses; many were households with small herds\nand little experience in herding. About 2,000 households lost all their livestock.\n23. In the early phase of the disaster, the Government released strategic reserves of fodder\nand fuel to affected provinces, and distributed relief items such as flour and tea. The State\nEmergency Commission organized the delivery of hay and fodder to the worst hit areas. In\nFebruary 2000, the Government launched an appeal for national and international donations to\nassist the herder population. Numerous nongovernment organizations (NGOs), embassies, and\ninternational organizations responded. Short-term relief measures until June 2000 focused on\nsupporting affected herder households and their livestock in overcoming the immediate effects\nof disaster. Since July 2000 affected herder households have been helped to restock their\ndecimated herds and stock up food and fodder reserves for the winter.\nC. Constraints and Issues\n24. Major agricultural reforms introduced by the Government in the first half of the 1990s\nincluded the privatization of state farms and negdels, deregulation of prices of major agricultural\nproducts, and liberalization of agricultural trade. These policy and institutional reforms were\nsupported  by  the  ASP  (footnote  1).  From  1996  onward,  adopted  reforms  focused  on\nmacroeconomic stabilization, reduction of the public sector, and private sector development.\nDespite substantial progress with reform, key constraints and issues remain that undermine\nagricultural performance.", "6\n1. Private Sector Activity\n25. During the 1990s almost all livestock and most crop farms were privatized. This process\nnow needs to be completed with the privatization of the remaining crop farms which have\nsignificant national or provincial government shareholdings.\n26. The  changes  in  ownership  structure  have  frequently  failed  to  yield  significant\nimprovements in productivity and profitability. This is mainly because the supply of inputs, the\nprocessing and marketing of outputs, and the provision of financial services, which previously\nwere organized and controlled by the state, deteriorated and left a vacuum that has not been\nadequately filled by the private sector. Also many of the new owners have little knowledge, and\nreceived little advice, on how to manage their assets. Although Mongolia's human resources are\nhigh in literacy and technical disciplines, they are limited in terms of entrepreneurial attitudes\nand skills, accounting, marketing, and other market-oriented business practices. Increasingly,\nthe cooperative movement is seen as providing an important avenue to strengthen the needed\nhuman resource skills and management capacity.\n27. The privatization of state-owned enterprises involved in the processing of livestock and\ncrop products proceeded much slower than that of livestock and crop farms. In the pretransition\nperiod agricultural processing was concentrated in a few, large enterprises, some of which\ncontinue to have the state as the major shareholder and hold a dominant market position. With\nthe collapse of traditional export markets, major agricultural processors are now operating at low\ncapacity, seriously constraining their ability to service debts and, for state-owned enterprises,\nundermining  privatization  attempts.  In  addition,  several  large-scale  enterprises  that  were\ndeveloped with the assistance of Council of Mutual Economic Assistance countries, such as\nwool spinning, knitting, shoe making, and leather factories, became unviable with the end of\ncentral planning and had to shut down. As a result, most of the wool, hides, and skins, and\nabout half of the cashmere are now exported in raw form. Efforts are needed to help enterprises\nremaining in the public sector, such as Biokombinat, a factory which produces vaccines for\ncombating animal diseases, to operate autonomously and compete fairly with the private sector.\n28. The entry of new privately owned trading and processing enterprises has been slow due\nto the limited availability of investment and working capital, and the overly centralized structure\nof the remaining processing industry. However, the share of small- and medium-sized privately\nowned  plants  is  gradually  increasing,  and  in  some  areas,  such  as  cashmere  and  flour\nprocessing, becoming large enough to challenge the market power of the large processors.\nMost of the investment activities are taking place in a few urban centers, indicating a role for\ncarefully structured support programs to promote investment activities in more remote areas.\n2. Trade Regime and Taxation\n29. The liberalization of the trade regime contributed to establishing a more competitive\nposition for the country's domestic production. In the mid-1990s, Mongolia had a free trade\nregime with zero import duties and no nontariff barriers. This policy was partially reversed in\n1999 when a discriminatory trade regime with tariffs ranging from zero to 15 percent was\nreintroduced, with the 15 percent rate levied seasonally on wheat, potatoes, and vegetables. An\nexport tax on raw cashmere was adopted in 1997. Cumbersome and nontransparent customs\ncontrols  and  export  licensing  practices  also  tax  agricultural  exports.  To  encourage  export\ngrowth, clear procedures need to be established for applications for and issuance of export\nlicenses for agricultural products.", "7\n30. Currently the option of raising certain import duties and export taxes is under discussion,\nin part due to the need to contain the fiscal deficit. However, transport costs alone constitute an\nenormous penalty to Mongolian trade, and offer high rates of equivalent protection to domestic\nproduction. Another option, in the longer term, would be to broaden the tax base. Agriculture\ncurrently accounts for about a third of GDP, but due to broad, nontargeted tax exemptions\ncontributes  only  a  small  share  of  the  national  tax  revenue.  However,  as  the  tax  base  is\nbroadened, tax incentives need to be rationalized to encourage investment in rural areas.\n3. Agricultural Marketing System\n31. The privatization of livestock and crop farms was carried out before the restructuring of\ninput and output marketing, which is needed to provide incentives and channels for increased\nagricultural  activity.  Partly  because  of  market  logistics  and  low  monetization,  subsistence\nproduction in rural areas, barter transactions, and in-kind wage payments are common. With a\nshortage of cash and a high-risk production environment, producers are reluctant to use inputs\nthat are not absolutely necessary. This, together with the lack of price differentiation for higher\nquality raw materials, is contributing to low productivity and poor product quality.\n32. Processing plants, especially for livestock raw materials, use a system of procurement\nagents and act as monopsonistic buyers in small rural markets. Producers often receive not\ncash but kind, usually in the form of household consumption goods on which the terms of trade\nare heavily skewed in favor of the agents. Many herder households are isolated during the\nsummer when most buying takes place, and have little price information or access to markets.\nThe agent's willingness to buy small quantities of fiber or a few animals for trekking to slaughter\ncan be attractive to a herder with only a few animals and little market power. So far agricultural\nproducers  have  received  limited  advice  on  how  to  cooperate  to  improve  their  bargaining\nposition. However, in some regions cooperative marketing is increasingly being used to improve\nreturns for producers.\n33. The marketing of agricultural raw materials follows a highly seasonal pattern. Cashmere\nis usually marketed in May, wool in July, wheat in September, and livestock in autumn. Due to a\nlack of working capital, many processing plants have difficulty acquiring the desired amount and\nquality of raw materials when they are offered. In addition, processors in the crop subsector\nhave difficulty competing with imported goods, and many livestock processors have yet to\nreestablish their export channels. Export opportunities in the meat and meat products industries\nare particularly constrained by the absence of standards and qualified, licensed veterinarians to\nsupervise meat hygiene and production.\n4. Cooperative System\n34. When the negdels were privatized in the early 1990s, some ceased to exist, some were\nrestructured into other legal forms, and the remainder were established as cooperatives. New\ncooperatives have also been formed. Currently about 1,300 entities at the primary level have a\ntotal membership of about 5 percent of the Mongolian population. More than two thirds of these\nentities are cooperatives, and a quarter of them are agricultural cooperatives. The cooperatives\nare organized in seven cooperative associations covering agriculture (mainly livestock), small-\nscale industry and trade, and savings and credit services. Supplementary Appendix A provides\nan overview of the cooperative system and the activities of cooperatives and their associations.\n35. By  the  mid-1990s,  many  households,  especially  in  rural  areas,  were  not  able  to\nparticipate in the emerging market economy. By working on their own and often in isolation, they\nhad few opportunities to pool limited resources and develop favorable market structures. Some", "8\nof the new herders households who had received livestock during the negdel privatization also\nlacked  the  professional  background  to  manage  these  assets.  Similar  to  other  transition\ncountries, this situation created new interest in cooperatives. When asked about their most\npressing  needs,  herder  and  cultivator  households,  especially  in  more  remote  areas,  often\nemphasize that besides improved access to financial services they need better marketing and\ninput supply channels. They are aware that when they bargain on their own with private traders\nthey are receiving relatively low prices for their produce, while they pay high prices for inputs\nand consumer goods. Many realize that their agricultural activities could be improved if they\norganized  themselves  into  groups  which  needed  to  be  larger  than  their  extended  family.\nCooperatives are seen by many agricultural and other rural producers as having the potential to\nexpand  the  local  organizational  basis  needed  for  economically  viable  activities,  such  as\nmarketing and processing, thereby providing greater income security and higher returns to their\nmembers.\n36. In some regions cooperatives and their associations are now increasing their activities to\nimprove  services  and  provide  collective  income-earning  opportunities  for  their  members.\nHowever, the expansion of cooperative activities is currently limited by several constraints.\nMany rural households still have limited knowledge about cooperative activities in a market\neconomy.  Also  cooperatives  have  limited  access  to  operating  capital,  necessary  for  their\nmarketing activities, and to investment capital, needed to improve production, marketing, and\nprocessing facilities. Many cooperatives also lack the knowledge to prepare business plans and\nthe financial expertise to effectively use credit. Due to human resource and funding constraints,\nthe internal management of cooperatives and their cooperative associations is also often weak,\nand the provision of vital services such as accounting and auditing is limited. The tax treatment\nof cooperatives also requires significant rationalization. In more remote areas, communication\nand transport problems pose serious constraints to cooperative development. The legislative\nand regulatory framework for the development of cooperatives was significantly strengthened\nwith the adoption of the Cooperative Law and the Cooperative Development Program in 1998;\nhowever, the program remains largely unimplemented.\n5. Rural Financial System\n37. Before 1990, all banking transactions in Mongolia were carried out by the State Bank,\nwhich also acted as the central bank. The agriculture sector was supported through a complex\nsystem of subsidized and directed credit with the costs being largely borne by the financial\nsector, the national budget, and some countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.\nIn 1991, the functions of the State Bank were transferred to the Bank of Mongolia (BOM), now\nacting as the central bank, and five newly established commercial banks. During the 1990s,\nseveral major financial crises were experienced, the last in 1998. Partly as a result of these, the\nfinancial sector has remained relatively small, and little cash is circulating in the countryside.\nRestructuring of the financial sector continues with substantial assistance.7\n38. At the beginning of 2000 Mongolia had 13 banks. Of these, the Agricultural Bank has by\nfar the largest rural network with branches and subbranches in most provincial and district\ncenters.  During  the  most  recent  banking  crisis,  the  Agricultural  Bank  became  illiquid  and\ninsolvent, and in 1999 BOM placed it under conservatorship and later receivership. Lending\nactivities were stopped, but other services including the distribution of salaries and pension\n                                                          \n7 ADB has played an important role in the financial sector, providing TAs and two loans: Loan 1509-MON: Financial\nSector Program, for $35 million, approved on 16 December 1996; and, in cooperation with World Bank's Financial\nSector Adjustment Credit of $32 million, Loan 1743-MON: Second Financial Sector Program, for $15 million,\napproved on 22 June 2000.", "9\npayments continued. A restructuring plan was finalized, and a business plan prepared8 with the\naim of transforming the bank into a commercially viable entity. Following recapitalization in mid-\n2000, control of the Agricultural Bank was passed to a new board of directors and executive\nmanagement,  including  two  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)\nfunded staff. In September 2000, BOM and the World Bank approved the business plan for the\nperiod up to July 2002. BOM approval to initiate lending activities is expected by the end of\n2000.\n39. The  Post  Bank  has  the  second  largest  branch  network  and  is  in  the  process  of\nexpanding its rural presence. It currently offers a limited amount of short-term credit to larger\nagricultural  enterprises  from  its  headquarters.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2000,  the  Post  Bank\nreceived a BOM permit for lending in six provinces, and is now in the process of training its rural\ncredit officers to be able to start rural lending in November 2000. The ZOOS Bank and Erel\nBank are among a small group of banks that have a limited branch network. They provide some\nfinancial services to rural clients, mostly to agricultural marketing and processing companies.\nMongolia's  nonbank  financial  sector,  comprising  savings  and  credit  cooperatives,  finance\ncompanies, and leasing companies, is at a nascent stage of development. Most of these\nbusinesses are not active in rural areas. An overview of the rural financial system is provided in\nSupplementary Appendix B.\n40. Currently little credit is available for people in rural areas. Interest rates are high in real\nterms, ranging from 2.5 to 5 percent per month at commercial banks and about 10 percent per\nmonth at pawnshops, but is slowly declining as the financial system recovers. A recent study9\nshows that about a quarter of rural households have bank accounts, which are mostly used for\nreceiving pensions, salaries, and other transfers. Savings mobilization is constrained by the\nperception that banks have limited credibility. About 80 percent of the rural households claim\nthat they are in urgent need of reliable financial services, and that they are looking for safe\nsavings options as well as credit opportunities. Delivery of financial services and improved\naccess to credit for the rural population is a key requirement for restoring economic growth and\nemployment in rural areas, and coordinated aid support to strengthen the rural financial system\ncontinues to be essential.\n6. Institutional Capacity and Governance\n41. During  the  last  decade,  a  series  of  major  changes  were  introduced  regarding  the\ninstitutional setup of agricultural and agriculture-related agencies nationally and locally. In a\ndevolution of administrative control to the local level during the early 1990s, the Government\ntransferred several agricultural functions to the 22 provincial governments. In 1996, the Ministry\nof Food and Agriculture and the Ministry of Industry were amalgamated to form the Ministry of\nAgriculture  and  Industry.  The  structure  of  Government  agricultural  support  services  was\nrationalized  and  grouped  in  either  implementing  or  regulatory  functions  within  two  main\nagencies under the ministry. These organizational changes were accompanied with a significant\nreduction in the number of staff. In addition, fiscal constraints resulted in reduced nonsalary\ndiscretionary budgets, and high staff turnover. Policy formulation in the agriculture sector lacked\nan overall framework for subsector policies and programs, and aid coordination was weak.\nPolicy implementation was largely dependent on lower levels of government, which often did not\nhave the policy priorities and funding resources required to implement programs designed at the\nnational  level.  No  consistent  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  program  implementation  was\n                                                          \n8 Support has been provided under TA 3208-MON: Strengthening Restructuring of the Bank System \u2013 Agriculture\nBank of Mongolia, for $220,000, approved on 17 June 1999.\n9 Japan International Cooperation Agency, and Ministry of Finance, Mongolia. 2000.

Ulaanbaatar.", "10\nconducted,  and  the  lack  of  electricity  and  outdated  telephone  connections  in  most  district\ncenters made communication within provinces difficult.\n42. Following the elections in July 2000, the Government structure was again reorganized.\nThe former Ministry of Agriculture and Industry was split into the Ministry of Industry and Trade\nand the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MFA). The internal organization of MFA and its related\nimplementing and regulatory agencies was streamlined. Salaries were increased, and new\nmanagement systems introduced. Institutional strengthening is nevertheless required for MFA to\nfulfill its mandated role in policy formulation, regulation, and monitoring and evaluation, and to\ncontinue  the  transformation  of  its  functions  away  from  direct  involvement  in  agricultural\nproduction and marketing activities. Commodity aid emerged as an important feature of the\nagricultural economy in the 1990s with the potential to significantly distort domestic markets, if\nnot carefully managed. The proceeds from the monetization of commodity aid now need to be\nmanaged and utilized in a transparent and accountable manner, and the remaining procurement\nand sales activities of Government agencies must be carried out without influencing market\nprices.\n7. Agricultural Support Services\n43. With the institutional changes during the last few years, the emphasis on cost recovery\nfor agricultural support services has increased. But producers often find it difficult to avail of\nthese services because of limited cash availability, the high cost of credit, and adverse terms-of-\ntrade between agricultural inputs and outputs. The outreach of MFA\u2019s agricultural extension\ncenter is severely curtailed by the lack of staff and budgetary resources. Agricultural research is\nsimilarly weak. It provides little tangible support to extension services, and is not oriented to\nmeeting  the  demand  of  agricultural  producers  or  processors.  To  support  private  sector\ndevelopment, agricultural research services need to be responsive to the demands of producers\nand processors, and adequately organized and funded. Some success has been achieved with\nthe Green Revolution Program, approved in 1997, which aims to improve supplementary food\nand income to low income families by assisting with potato and vegetable production. It relies on\nthe lower levels of Government as well as on the initiatives of schools and NGOs in the\ncountryside.  It  is  credited  as  having  contributed  to  the  increased  potato  and  vegetable\nproduction that occurred in the second half of the 1990s. The Green Revolution Program can be\nenhanced  by  (i)  strengthening  the  involvement  of  NGOs  by  awarding  them  contracts  for\nprogram implementation, (ii) focusing benefits on vulnerable groups, (iii) including a broader\nrange of activities, (iv) introducing cost recovery, and (v) establishing a mechanism at the\nprovincial  level  to  ensure  that  the  different  programs  targeted  at  vulnerable  groups  are\ncoordinated.\n44. Veterinary and breeding services are partly privatized, but public-private partnership\narrangements are still being adjusted with little progress to date. The professionalism of private\nveterinary practitioners needs to be upgraded, and the system of their remuneration revised to\nreflect their role as service providers in a market economy. In the area of vaccination policy, the\nGovernment must concentrate its limited resources on effective control of a limited range of key\ndiseases  rather  than  pursuing  an  ineffective  program  aimed  at  the  complete  coverage  of\nlivestock  diseases.  Some  efforts  have  been  undertaken  to  introduce  commercial  seed\nmultiplication but this has had little impact on the availability of quality seed, and farmers are\nforced  to  use  farm-saved  seed  of  poor  quality  and  outdated  varieties.  Due  to  poor\ncommunication channels in rural areas, many agricultural producers have no access to market\ninformation.  This  together  with  the  limited  availability  and  affordability  of  suitable  support\nservices is a major constraint to improving agricultural productivity and the quality of products.", "11\n8. Social Transformation\n45. Under central planning, unemployment and poverty were virtually unknown. Cutbacks in\npublic expenditure during the transition period led to a sharp decline in social services and jobs\nin provincial and district centers, and to an increase in the number of people considered to be\npoor. This was accompanied by a shift in population to rural areas. From 1990 to 1999, the rural\npopulation increased from 40 percent of the total population to almost 50 percent. People have\nalso been moving out of the provincial centers and minor towns either to Ulaanbaatar, which\nhas grown by 16 percent since 1990, or to the countryside. In rural areas the extensive livestock\nsector has been functioning as an informal safety net in times of limited formal employment\nopportunities.\n46. The privatization of the negdel livestock together with the population shift to rural areas\nresulted in a nearly threefold increase in the number of herders (from 148,000 in 1990 to\n418,000 in 1999). Similarly, the number of households whose primary source of income is\nderived from herding more than doubled (from 69,000 in 1989 to 197,000 in 1998) and is now\nequivalent to about 40 percent of the population. Strengthened by the overall growth in livestock\nnumbers,  herd  size  has  increased  substantially.  Following  privatization  in  1990,  about  80\npercent of households with livestock owned less than 50 animals, and only 4 percent owned\nmore  than  100  animals.10  By  1999,  the  number  of  households  with  less  than  50  animals\ndeclined to 36 percent, and the number of households with more than 100 animals increased to\n41 percent. In addition, the spread of households' herd sizes increased. In 1999 more than\n1,200 households had more than 1,000 animals; the majority of herder households had only\nenough  animals  to  live  on  a  subsistence  basis.  Many  of  the  people  who  moved  to  the\ncountryside to become new herders have small, marginally viable herds and limited skills, and\nare most vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks.\n9. Pasture and Well Management\n47. During the last decade, pressure on pastures has been widespread and increasing\nbecause of the significant changes in the size, structure, and management of the extensive\nlivestock subsector. The national herd grew by about 8 million head, or 19 million sheep\nequivalent units (SEU),11 and the average stocking rate increased from 0.34 SEU per ha to 0.46\nSEU per ha. The main reasons for the growth in livestock number include the need of an\nincreasing number of herder households to secure their livelihood, the general perception that\nmore livestock will increase economic security, the lack of marketing channels  to sell animals\nand the limited export demand, a large increase in the price for cashmere, and the absence of a\nweather-induced catastrophe until the winter of 1999/2000.\n48. Overgrazing and the loss of pasture productivity was recognized prior to 1990, and\nattempts were made to address the problem by (i) large-scale provision of supplementary\nfodder by the state; (ii) heavy investment in the development of wells, bores, and pumps to open\nup previously underutilized grazing land by providing reliable stock-watering facilities; and (iii)\ncontrols on the movement of herders, mostly within a particular district, relying on the authority\nof  negdel  managers  and  the  district  governor.  During  the  1990s  these  measures  were\ndiscontinued. As a result, the fodder supply industry has almost disappeared. More than 40\n                                                          \n10A herd of about 100 animals is generally considered as the minimum size for a self-sustaining household, although\nthe number varies considerably according to geographic area and species mix. Herding households with less than\n100 animals have been assessed as below the poverty line. Such herds are considered unsustainable and doomed\nto decline as the off-take exceeds the reproduction rate.\n11Livestock head are converted to SEUs using the following factors: sheep, 1; goat, 0.9; cattle, 6; horse, 7; and\ncamel, 5.", "12\npercent  of  the  wells  and  bores  nationwide  have  become  inoperative  due  to  the  lack  of\nmaintenance. Pastures that previously were supported by stock-watering facilities are now little\nused, and herder households who used to rely on these lands have moved to areas with reliable\nwater supplies. Furthermore, not much progress has been achieved in developing the tenure\nsystem for pasture land,12 and controls on herder movements are weak to nonexistent. This has\nencouraged a significant migration of herder households areas adjacent to larger towns and\ncities, and the central region of the country in order to have better access to markets, schools,\nand health services. Together, these factors have contributed to local overgrazing and conflicts\nover pasture rights, especially around population centers and major transportation routes.\n49. To  address  this  situation,  improved  land  management  systems  and  institutions  are\nurgently needed, including innovative mechanisms for conflict resolution. The former Ministry of\nAgriculture and Industry in 1998 started a small well rehabilitation program to increase the\nnumber of stock-watering points. Resources for well rehabilitation must be reinforced by putting\nin  place  arrangements  for  the  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  wells,  and  by\nintroducing a cost recovery mechanism.\n10. Risk Management\n50. Under central planning the state provided a comprehensive risk management system for\nagricultural producers, including continuous training and advice, salaries, livestock insurance,\nemergency fodder supplies, radio communication channels covering almost all of the country's\ndistricts, and national and local emergency plans, which included transport facilities for herder\nhouseholds and their animals in times of natural disasters. During the last decade this support\nstructure ceased to exist, and agricultural producers were forced to individually shoulder all risk\nassociated with agricultural production in a harsh environment. The severity of the effects of the\nlivestock disaster of the winter of 1999/2000 are to a large extent a result of the loss of the\nprevious risk management system.\n51. In addition to the short-term causes of the livestock disaster, i.e., a dry summer followed\nby  an  early,  cold,  and  snowy  winter,  several  medium-  to  long-  term  causes  contributed\nsignificantly  to  the  large  impact.  They  include  the  inflow  of  inexperienced  persons  to  the\nextensive livestock subsector and the concomitant emergence of many relatively small and\neconomically unsustainable herds, the unbalanced composition and growth of herds, increasing\nparasite loads due to limited veterinary services, uncontrolled breeding, the lack of reserves of\nhay and animal feed, shrinking grazing areas due to the lack of stock-watering points, the\nconcentration of livestock in areas around market centers, the breakdown of communication\nchannels in rural areas, and related to that, inadequate early warning systems and disaster\nmanagement planning.\n52. Medium- to longer-term measures to help reduce the vulnerability of the country to future\nnatural disasters need to include support for (i) alternative employment opportunities for small\nherder households such as vegetable production, (ii) better animal health, (iii) increased water\nand feed supply for livestock, (iv) improved marketing channels to reduce the need of herder\nhouseholds to graze their animals near provincial and district centers, and (v) improved rural\ncommunication channels. Close aid coordination will be essential to enable the Government to\n                                                          \n12The Land Law and the Land Management Regulations adopted in 1995 provide for a continued state-ownership of\nland, and for long-term, inheritable, but nontransferable leases to individuals and economic entities. Lease\ncertificates are issued for arable land and dairy farms, but not for pasture land. The Land Fee Payment Law of\n1997 sets fees for leasing land from the state, yet livestock herders using common pastureland and haymaking\nareas are exempt from land fee payments.", "13\naddress  these  needs  and  to  support  the  development  of  an  integrated  approach  to  risk\nmanagement, including improved provision of agricultural insurance.\nD. Government Expenditure\n53. Although agriculture contributes more than a third of GDP, only about 1.3 percent of total\nGovernment expenditure is being allocated for agricultural purposes. In 1999, this amounted to\nMNT4,861 million, of which MNT4,165 million was allocated for the national level and MNT696\nmillion for the country's 22 provinces. About 10 percent of the agricultural budget at the national\nlevel was used for salaries and benefits of staff in the former Ministry of Agriculture and\nIndustry, and its implementing and regulatory agencies. Close to 42 percent, or MNT1,755\nmillion, was spent on the supply of free vaccines for herders. The other main expenditure items\nincluded the State Reserve (for wheat, seed, and other goods) with MNT570 million, pasture\nprotection from rodents with MNT230 million, well rehabilitation with MNT292 million, and the\nGreen Revolution Program with MNT180 million.\nE. Government Objectives and Strategy\n54. The  Action  Plan  of  the  new  Government  adopted  in  September  2000  outlines  key\nobjectives in several policy areas, including economic policy, social policy, and regional and\nrural development policy. A key objective in the area of economic policy is to continue and\ndeepen  economic  reform  and  accelerate  economic  growth  by  (i)  ensuring  macroeconomic\nstability and strengthening fiscal policies; (ii) setting up a sound banking system and financial\nsector,  including  restructuring  and  strengthening  the  Agricultural  Bank;  (iii)  continuing  the\nprivatization  process  and  improving  its  efficiency;  (iv)  restoring  domestic  industries  and\npromoting export (in particular in the areas of livestock raw materials such as meat, fibers, skin,\nand hides), preventing a further decline in the crop industry, and intensifying the implementation\nof the Green Revolution Program; and (v) developing infrastructure. In the area of social policy,\na key element is the goal to reduce the number of households living under the poverty line by\nhalf by the end of 2004.\n55. The medium-term objectives for regional and rural development focus on improving the\nliving standards of people in rural areas through economic development, infrastructure, as well\nas taxation, investment, and credit policies. This includes (i) designing tax policies to encourage\ngrowth and investment in the regions; (ii) supporting herder initiatives for improving their life\nthrough the establishment of cooperatives; (iii) adopting a livestock insurance system and a\nsystem for protecting livestock from natural disasters, and establishing a disaster relief network;\n(iv)  developing  cooperation  among  herders,  farmers,  business  entities,  and  scientific  and\nresearch organizations; (v) improving the fight against animal diseases and strengthening the\ncapacity of veterinary laboratories; (vi) improving water supply in pasture areas and resolving\nthe issue of ownership of water spots; (vii) equipping all provincial centers with improved\ntelephone connections; and (viii) renovating and expanding radio studios, providing all provincial\ncenters with radio stations, and increasing the number and duration of radio channels in rural\nareas.\nF. External Assistance to the Sector\n56. Since  the  beginning  of  the  transition,  several  multilateral  and  bilateral  development\nagencies have supported Mongolia's agriculture sector. An overview is presented in Appendix 3.\nThree loans have been approved, including the ADB-funded ASP (footnote 1) and the Cadastral\nSurvey and Land Registration Project,13 and a loan from the International Fund for Agricultural\n                                                          \n13Loan 1736-MON: Cadastral Survey and Land Registration Project, for $9.9 million, approved on 2000.", "14\nDevelopment, which provides funds for poor households in two provinces to acquire livestock\nfrom better-off farmers.\n57. In the area of grant aid to the agriculture sector, three multilateral agencies predominate.\nThe United Nations Development Programme financed an emergency seeds project involving\nthe  import  of  Kazakh  wheat  for  multiplication.  The  European  Union  helped  to  strengthen\nveterinary diagnostic capabilities and laboratories, and in 1999 initiated a crop development\nproject,  which  provides  training  in  farm  management  and  marketing  for  enterprises  and\nadministrators in selected areas. In a second phase due to commence in 2001 it will support\nimproved  wheat  seed  production.  The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  financed  several\nsmaller projects in the livestock and crop subsectors.\n58. Among the bilateral agencies are the Japan International Cooperation Agency, USAID,\nthe  Danish  International  Development  Assistance,  and  the  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr\nTechnische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ). Japan provides the most bilateral assistance. Assistance\nhas been provided for upgrading agroprocessing industries, and for studies on agricultural\ncooperatives, rural banking, and saving mobilization. In addition, Japan has supplied food aid\nconsisting of flour and wheat, and provided fertilizers and agricultural machinery, which is sold\nthrough subsidized installment credit to farmers selected by MFA. The US has also provided\ncommodity aid, mainly in the form of wheat. Some of the counterpart funds generated from the\nsale of the wheat are used in the Agricultural Development Fund managed by MFA. Since 1997,\nUSAID has been assisting a number of smaller initiatives in crop and livestock production. GTZ\nis  involved  in  promoting  family  farming,  supporting  the  privatization  of  veterinary  services,\ntraining  cooperative  members,  and  assisting  the  Agricultural  Bank.  The  ASDP  has  been\ndesigned in close cooperation with the main international and bilateral development partners in\nthe agriculture sector.\nG. ADB's Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n1. Country Operational Strategy\n59. ADB's first country operational strategy (COS) for Mongolia was adopted in 1994. Its\nmain  aim  was  to  facilitate  the  country's  transition  to  a  market  economy  and  to  stimulate\neconomic growth. In the agriculture sector, the focus was mainly on improving the policy and\ninstitutional environment. During the period covered by the first COS, Mongolia implemented\nsubstantial reforms and experienced reasonable growth rates. But economic growth did not\nresult in a significant reduction in the number of people living below the poverty line.\n60. The new COS endorsed in March 2000 is placing poverty reduction at the same level of\nimportance as the need to stimulate economic growth. The main objective is to foster economic\ngrowth and reduce poverty by focusing on income and employment generation by developing\nthe private sector. The strategy emphasizes the need to promote good governance as an\noverarching objective. ADB interventions are to be guided by the main objective of growth with\npoverty  reduction.  Of  the  five  core  sectors  identified  for  ADB  support,  agriculture  has  the\npotential to (i) support private sector-led expansion of economic activity, (ii) strengthen the\nenabling  legal  and  regulatory  environment  to  stimulate  private  sector  activity,  (iii)  improve\nsupport services to overcome constraints to agricultural development, (iv) promote the improved\nprovision of financial services in rural areas, and (v) support improvements in land tenure.\n61. The  main  features  of  the  COS  and  the  strong  commitment  to  reduce  poverty  are\nsummarized in the Partnership Agreement signed in March 2000. The Partnership Agreement\nidentifies  specific  targets  for  poverty  reduction  and  establishes  mechanisms  to  monitor", "15\nperformance. A key target is to reduce the proportion of people living below the poverty line by\nat least half by 2005. The ASDP is fully consistent with ADB's country and sector strategy and\nthe Partnership Agreement.\n2. ADB Experience\n62. In the initial years after Mongolia joined ADB in 1990, ADB's operations in the agriculture\nsector were limited to providing TA. In 1992/93 three project preparatory TAs14 were approved\nbut  processing  was  deferred  pending  a  comprehensive  sector  review.  This  review  was\nundertaken in the second half of 1993,15 and identified serious weaknesses in the policy and\ninstitutional  environment  that  undermined  the  Government's  capacity  to  either  effectively\nimplement projects or bring about the transition to a sustainable, private sector-led agriculture\nsector. As a result, ADB's support shifted to policy and institutional reform in 1994, and in 1995\nthe ASP was approved. The reform program covered three broad policy areas including (i) the\npromotion of competitive markets, (ii) institutional support to facilitate competitive markets, and\n(iii)  social  and  environmental  concerns.  Two  TAs  were  simultaneously  approved  covering\ninstitutional strengthening of the former Ministry of Agriculture and Industry and its related\norganizations,16 and strengthening land-use policies.17 In addition, a study of the extensive\nlivestock production systems was approved in 1996.18\n63. ADB's  experience  with  loans  to  Mongolia's  agriculture  sector  is  limited  to  the  ASP\nimplemented during 1995-1998. A program completion review carried out in 1999 evaluated the\nimplementation and coordination of the ASP as partially successful. While the ASP\u2019s policy\nreform agenda was not fully achieved, general progress in macroeconomic reform was rather\nimpressive. In particular, the privatization process made significant progress, despite a slow\nstart,  and  price  liberalization  of  the  major  agricultural  and  food  products  was  largely\naccomplished. Several lessons can be learned from ASP implementation. First, ownership of\nthe policy reform agenda and commitment to its implementation are critical to the success of\nreform measures. Second, within a transition economy such as Mongolia, the already weak\nimplementation  capacity  of  relevant  institutions  is  eroded  by  the  fiscal  constraints  that\naccompany the early stages of the reform process. Longer-term TA is needed to improve and\nmonitor implementation. And third, continuing dialogue with the aid community is needed over\nthe program period to ensure coordination with other programs. These lessons have been taken\ninto account in the design of the ASDP.\n64. The ASP was one of several program loans supported by ADB to support structural\nadjustment. A relatively high percentage of ADB lending to Mongolia, with about 29 percent of\nall loans and 32 percent of the total loan amount, have been program loans. Release of the\nsecond  tranches,  albeit  with  delays  in  some  of  the  program  loans,  demonstrate  the\nGovernment's commitment to, and capability for implementing difficult policy and sector reforms.\nOverall,  ADB's  portfolio  in  Mongolia  is  performing  satisfactorily  and  implementation  is\nproceeding  on  schedule,  despite  economic  uncertainty,  fiscal  constraints,  and  institutional\nweaknesses.\n                                                          \n14TA  1639-MON: Livestock Feed Improvement,  for  $410,900,  approved  on  7  January  1992;  TA  1808-MON:\nAgricultural Processing, Storage and Distribution, for $400,000, approved on 17 December 1992; and TA 1886-\nMON: Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation, for $500,000, approved on 13 May 1993.\n15Asian Development Bank. 1994.

The ASDP\u2019s investment Project will be ADB's first investment project directly addressing\nMongolia's  agriculture  sector.  However,  lessons  can  be  learned  from  ADB's  operational\nexperience  with  agricultural  projects  in  other  transition  economies  of  Central  Asia.  These\nlessons emphasize the consideration of (i) the dynamic nature of agriculture sector reforms and\nthe need for close monitoring of project implementation, (ii) the critical importance of strong\nGovernment ownership of the project and commitment to its implementation, and (iii) a realistic\nassessment of institutional capacity of Government implementation agencies. These lessons\nwere incorporated in the design of the ASDP\u2019s investment Project by supporting activities that\nare part of the Government agenda, as outlined in the Action Plan, and addressing the urgent\nneed for capacity building.\nIV. THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n66. Mongolia's transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented system during the\n1990s has had a dramatic impact on the agriculture sector. With the removal of large subsidies\npreviously provided by the state, the agriculture sector contracted sharply in the early 1990s.\nHowever, by the mid-1990s agriculture had restored output to pretransition levels, and thus\nhelped to prevent a far worse contraction of the economy in the initial years of the transition.\n67. Even though the agriculture sector, in particular the extensive livestock subsector, was\nable  to  support  the  economy  during  the  most  difficult  years,  several  factors  continue  to\nundermine  its  performance.  This  is  despite  the  implementation  of  major  market  reforms,\nincluding  privatization,  deregulation  of  prices  of  agricultural  products,  and  liberalization  of\nagricultural trade. It is becoming increasingly apparent that while almost all livestock and most\ncrop farms have been privatized, many of the new owners have little knowledge, and have not\nbeen taught how to manage their assets in a market economy. The supply of critical support\nservices, which was previously organized and controlled by the state, deteriorated and left a\nvacuum that has not yet been adequately filled by the private sector. While the financial sector\nis being restructured with substantial external assistance, very little lending is provided in rural\nareas.  The  limited  availability  of  credit  in  the  countryside  and  the  high-risk  production\nenvironment of Mongolia's agriculture sector negatively affect the demand for support services.\nThe supply of support services such as research and extension is weak due to lack of staff and\nbudget resources. Other support services, such as veterinary services, are partly privatized but\npublic-private partnership arrangements are still being adjusted with little progress to date. As a\nresult of the limited availability and use of support services and other inputs, the productivity of\nmany agricultural enterprises is very low. In the livestock subsector the problem is intensified by\nthe overgrazing of many pastures as a result of the substantial increase in the national herd and\nthe large number of inoperative stock-watering wells.\n68. Closely related to the problem of low productivity is the lack of marketing channels\nneeded to increase incentives for agricultural activity. The restructuring of marketing and the\nprivatization of processing enterprises has proceeded much slower than the privatization of\nlivestock collectives and state farms. With the collapse of traditional export markets and the\nreduction  of  subsidies,  many  agricultural  processing  plants  have  been  closed,  and  the\nremaining  are  operating  with  low  capacity.  The  entry  of  private  trading  and  processing\nenterprises has been slow due to the lack of investment and working capital. Partly because of\nmarket  logistics  and  low  monetization  in  rural  areas,  subsistence  production  and  barter\ntransactions are now common. Due to poor communication links, many agricultural producers\nhave little access to market and other information. The cooperative system, which offers the\nmost promising avenue for the provision of marketing and other services, the delivery of local", "17\npublic goods, and collective income-earning activities in rural areas is only recently receiving\nincreasing attention.\n69. To address these two main problem areas, i.e., low productivity and limited marketing\nchannels, and the resulting constraints on income-earning opportunities in rural areas, a two-\npronged approach is required. This involves (i) the deepening and refinement of the policy and\nlegal framework for agriculture, and (ii) the improved provision of support services for production\nand marketing as well as credit. Thus, the ASDP will integrate a policy loan with targeted policy\nactions, and an investment loan providing support in the two main problem areas.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n70. The  sector  goals  are  to  develop  a  more  market-oriented,  efficient,  and  sustainable\nagriculture sector and reduce poverty by providing increased income opportunities. The specific\npurpose  is  to  increase  productivity  and  profitability  of  agricultural  producers.  The  primary\nstrategic development objective is economic growth, and the secondary objective is poverty\nreduction. The ASDP will include both direct and indirect poverty interventions, and poor people\nare expected to comprise at least one third of the beneficiaries. The emphasis on poverty\nreduction  is  in  line  with  the  COS  for  Mongolia,  the  Partnership  Agreement,  and  the\nGovernment's Action Plan.\n71. The  ASDP  comprises  a  policy  reform  agenda  with  seven  policy  areas,  and  the\ninvestment Project with three components. Associated with the ASDP will be TA for Capacity\nBuilding in Agriculture.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions\n72. The policy reform agenda is designed as a follow-up loan to the ASP. With the broad\nframework for market-based development of agriculture in place, the policy loan will support\nsecond generation reforms to deepen, refine, and more effectively implement the policy and\nlegal framework for agriculture. The emphasis is on focusing Government activities on providing\nessential support services, and creating a favorable environment for the private sector to more\neffectively undertake functions that previously were carried out by the state, including the supply\nof inputs, the processing and marketing of outputs, and the provision of financial services.\n73. The program of policy reforms is in line with the Government's Action Plan adopted in\nSeptember 2000, and will support several of the Government's planned initiatives. It is also\nclosely linked to the investment components of the ASDP, and geared to bring about the stated\nsector  goals  and  create  the  institutional,  financial,  and  regulatory  conditions  necessary  to\nsuccessfully implement the ASDP and sustain the improvements thus gained. The development\npolicy letter setting forth the policy framework and the policy matrix is in Appendix 4. The policy\nprogram will provide support for the following.\n(i) Reduce price and other distortions to improve resource allocation and efficiency\nin  the  agriculture  sector.  Related  policy  actions  include  facilitating  growth  of\nagricultural exports, minimizing the influence of procurement and sale activities of\nGovernment  agencies  on  market  prices,  and  making  more  efficient  use  of\nfinancial resources arising from the sale of commodity aid.\n(ii) Promote  competitive  markets  for  agricultural  inputs,  outputs,  and  processed\ngoods. Related policy actions focus on completing the privatization process of\ncrop  farms,  achieving  operational  and  financial  autonomy  for  enterprises", "18\nremaining in the public sector such as Biokombinat, which produces livestock\nvaccines,  and  implementing  all  provisions  of  the  Cooperative  Law  and  the\nCooperative Development Program.\n(iii) Ensure the delivery of financial services and provide improved access to credit\nfor the rural population. Related policy actions relate to restoring the Agricultural\nBank, which has the largest network of rural branches, as a commercially viable\nentity.\n(iv) Rationalize tax incentives to promote investment in rural areas. Related policy\nactions include exempting primary producers rather than products from value-\nadded  tax,  providing  the  legal  framework  for  agricultural  equipment  leasing,\nrationalizing the tax structure for cooperatives, and preparing an action plan to\npromote investments in disadvantaged rural areas.\n(v) Improve productivity and sustainability in extensive livestock production. Related\npolicy actions comprise rationalizing the public and private sector responsibilities\nin the control of animal diseases, ensuring minimum standards for meat hygiene\nservices,  maintaining  professional  standards  of  veterinary  practitioners,\nimproving pasture land use and management, and providing for more sustainable\nrehabilitation of stock-watering wells.\n(vi) Strengthen  agricultural  research  and  extension  to  support  private  sector\nagriculture. Related policy actions comprise making research more responsive to\nthe demands of producers and processors, and providing technical advice and\nbusiness development support.\n(vii) Mitigate risks in agriculture and ensure food security, income, and employment\nfor vulnerable groups. Related policy actions include adopting a policy on risk\nmanagement in agriculture, improving the provision of agricultural insurance, and\nreorienting the Government's Green Revolution Program to stimulate vegetable\nand potato production among vulnerable households. These policy actions will\nspecifically help to mitigate the impacts of future natural disasters.\nD.  Capacity Building\n74. Assistance in the areas of advice, training, and capacity building is an integral part of\neach of the components of the investment Project to improve institutional capacity of agricultural\nagencies and ensure effective project implementation. Capacity building activities are discussed\nin detail in paras. 80-103. The TA associated with the ASDP also focuses on capacity building.\nE. The Investment Project\n1. Project Description\n75. Linked closely to these policy reforms, the investment Project will focus on delivering an\nintegrated package of critical support services to improve productivity and profitability in the\nagriculture  sector.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years,  and  include  three\ncomponents: (i) production and marketing support, (ii) credit, and (iii) project management. The\ndesign of the components has also been guided by the need for medium- to longer-term\nmeasures to help reduce the vulnerability of the agriculture sector to natural disasters (paras.\n51-52).", "19\n76. The activities of the three components will focus on four provinces in the relatively\nremote and poor western part of Mongolia: Dzavhan, Hovd, Gobialtay, and Urs. The credit\ncomponent  will  also  cover  the  north-central  provinces  of  Darhan-Uul  and  Selenge,  which\ncomprise the country's most important wheat producing area. An overview of the six provinces\nis in Appendix 5.\n77. The four western provinces comprise about a quarter of the country's land area and\nlivestock, and 15 percent of the population. Due to the arid nature of the environment, the most\nimportant agricultural activity is extensive livestock production. Crop and fodder production\ndeclined drastically during the 1990s. Only vegetable production is now higher than in the\npretransition  period  (except  in  Dzavhan).  During  the  livestock  disaster  in  the  winter  of\n1999/2000, Urs and Dzavhan were the third and fourth most affected provinces in the country,\nwhile Hovd and Gobialtay were relatively little affected.\n78. The standard of living in the four western provinces is generally lower than in the more\ncentrally  located  provinces.  Three  of  the  four  western  provinces  are  among  the  poorest\nprovinces in Mongolia, with Hovd being the second, Dzavhan the third, and Urs the fifth poorest.\nAccording to the Government's income-based poverty line, the population living below the\nminimum standard level in these three provinces in 1998 was 43 percent, 41 percent, and 34\npercent (the national average was 26 percent). A main reason for the large number of poor\npeople in the three provinces is the high percentage of households with small herds. Although\ntheir number is declining, in 1999 more than half of all households with animals in Hovd,\nDzavhan, and Urs had less than 100 animals. By contrast, in Gobialtay, where 16 percent of the\npeople were living below the poverty line, less than 40 percent of the households with livestock\nhad less than 100 animals.\n79. The  credit  component  will  cover  the  four  western  provinces  and  two  north-central\nprovinces: Darhan-Uul and Selenge. The extension of the credit component to Darhan-Uul and\nSelenge  will,  among  others,  facilitate  increased  wheat  production  and  productivity  in  the\ncountry's major wheat-producing area. The low level of wheat production and the continuing rise\nof flour and wheat imports to supply domestic demand have led to growing Government concern\nabout food security. However, the credit component in Darhan-Uul and Selenge will not be\nlimited to wheat farmers. A summary of the three project components follows.\na. Production and Marketing Support Component\n80. The production and marketing support component includes assistance for (i) expanding\nsmall-scale  horticulture  production  among  vulnerable  groups  under  the  Green  Revolution\nProgram;  (ii)  strengthening  veterinary  services;  (iii)  rehabilitating  wells;  (iv)  developing  the\ncooperative  system  to  provide  better  marketing  and  processing  services  to  agricultural\nproducers; and (v) improving rural communication channels, including telephone and radio\nservices.\ni. Green Revolution Program\n81. The Project will strengthen and reorient MFA's Green Revolution Program in the four\nwestern provinces. Advice will be provided not only on the production of a few vegetables but\nalso on other horticultural products, as well as on opportunities for storage, processing, and\nmarketing. The subcomponent will focus on vulnerable groups, including households headed by\nwomen and the unemployed in the provincial and district centers, households with small herds\nthat graze around these centers, as well as households affected by the livestock disaster during", "20\nthe winter of 1999/2000. The promotion of horticultural activities will enable these groups to\nimprove their food security and diversify incomes by marketing their surplus produce.\n82. At  the  national  level,  support  will  be  provided  for  workshops  for  provincial  Green\nRevolution representatives and for preparing more information material and advice in the areas\nof horticulture, marketing and processing, and business practices for dissemination at the local\nlevel. At the provincial level, funds will be provided for the enhancement of the agroparks,\ntraining  for  district  agronomists,  workshops,  involvement  of  NGOs  in  market  surveys  and\nadvisory services, and various promotional activities such as agricultural shows. Assistance will\nalso be provided to send farmers to see successful ventures in other districts, and to experiment\nwith  new  crops.  Provincial  green  revolution  committees  will  have  small  funds  to  execute\nminiprojects, such as the provision of seed, and to experiment with new crops and irrigation\nmethods.  At  the  district  level,  additional  agroparks  will  be  set  up  to  provide  on-farm\ndemonstrations  and  advice,  and  training  to  farmers.  These  interventions  are  expected  to\nincrease horticulture production in the four western provinces by 10 percent at the end of year\nfive.\nii. Veterinary Services\n83. This subcomponent will help to prevent increasing losses from animal disease, and to\nmeet the requirements of potential livestock and meat importing countries. Veterinary services\nprovided by the public and private sectors will be strengthened to enable them to fulfil their\nrespective roles.\n84. Meat hygiene standards will be improved by providing training on international standards\nto  a  core  of  meat  inspectors  who  supervise  production  for  export  at  abattoirs  and  meat\nprocessing plants. The Project will intensively train two veterinary inspectors of the Veterinary\nInspection Agency of MFA on international standards of meat inspection. In turn they will\nbecome trainers of about 24 veterinarians from both the Veterinary Inspection Agency and the\nprivate sector who will then be licensed to conduct their responsibilities. In line with international\npractice, the remuneration of these trained inspectors will be covered by levying a service\ncharge on export products.\n85. To enhance animal disease surveillance, improve diagnostic capability, and prepare\ncost-effective  disease  control  plans,  the  Veterinary  Epidemiology  Unit  in  the  Veterinary\nImplementing Agency of MFA, the Central Veterinary Laboratory, and the laboratories in the\nfour western provinces will be supported. Veterinarians in each district will be trained in disease\ndiagnosis. The results of these surveys will allow a more rational selection of diseases to be\ncontrolled by the public sector, and those causing private losses to be relinquished to private\nresponsibility.  This  will  contribute  to  an  improved  design  of  the  Government's  support  to\nveterinary services.\n86. The emerging private veterinary sector will receive training in animal husbandry, field\ndiagnostics, clinical treatment, and business management through part-time use of staff of the\nFaculty of Veterinary Science at the State University of Agriculture with the collaboration of the\nveterinary implementing agency. Faculty staff will include those with experience gained from the\nGTZ and US-funded Agriculture Cooperative Development International/Volunteers Overseas\nfor Cooperative Assistance (ACDI/VOCA) projects, which are providing limited support in this\narea. During the project period three training courses will be held in each of the four western\nprovinces to improve the skills of about 240 veterinarians. Private veterinarians will be able to\nborrow from PFIs to enable them to have sufficient stocks of pharmaceuticals to support their\npractices and to sell to herders.", "21\n87. Finally, support will be given to the consultative process and changes in procedures and\nlegislation necessary to establish a regulatory body (board of veterinarians) responsible for the\naccreditation, registration, and discipline of all veterinarians and paraveterinarians. The services\nwill be conducted from the veterinary implementing agency until the first register is produced. At\nthat stage the board is expected to become a self-regulatory body, recovering cost through an\nannual retention fee paid by the members.\niii. Well Rehabilitation\n88. By 1995, about 1,900 wells, or 40 percent of the wells that were available for the\nwatering of livestock and supply of drinking water in the four western provinces in 1989, had\nfallen into disrepair. The number is estimated to be even larger today. Most affected are the\nmedium and deep wells, which usually consist of an electrical pump powered by a diesel\nengine. To address the substantial need for an increased number of stock-watering points, the\nsubcomponent, in close coordination with MFA's well rehabilitation program and the TA on\npasture management (paras. 143-146), will support the rehabilitation of about 400 wells in the\nfour  western  provinces.  Since  nonoperational  wells  tend  to  be  in  varying  condition,  their\nrehabilitation requirements may range from a few spare parts to the installment of new pumps\nand engines. Average well repair costs are estimated at $2,000. Domestic and international\nexperts in close cooperation with herder communities and local governments will assist in\nprioritizing the wells to be rehabilitated taking into account both drinking water and livestock\nwatering  needs,  and  in  determining  the  most  suitable  and  cost-effective  way  of  well\nrehabilitation.  Factors  to  be  considered  include  the  ownership/possession  of  the  well,  the\nintended users and use patterns, the technical aspects, and the herders' willingness and ability\nto pay water user fees to cover operation and maintenance costs. The well rehabilitation work\nwill be contracted out to provincial water supply boards or, in provinces where the boards have\nbeen privatized, to water supply companies. The herders intending to use a rehabilitated well\nwill receive training, and contracts will be made with groups of herders or individuals assigning\nresponsibility for well operation and maintenance, and collection of user fees.\n89. Well rehabilitation will start in the second year of project implementation. During the first\nyear a mechanism for at least partially recovering well rehabilitation costs will be developed.\nSuch mechanism may include the establishment of a well rehabilitation fund to be administered\nby a financial institution, which would be responsible for recovering a certain percentage of the\ncost. The recovered funds could be used to expand the well rehabilitation program.\niv. Cooperative Development\n90. In  close  cooperation  with  GTZ  and  the  attached  TA  on  cooperative  training,  the\nsubcomponent will provide extensive training and strengthen the capacity and competitiveness\nof the cooperative system in the provision of marketing and other services to their members.\nThe  activities  will  be  carried  out  at  the  national  level  and  in  the  four  western  provinces.\nCooperative representatives of other provinces may join activities in Ulaanbaatar or at the\nprovincial level. Assistance will be provided to cooperative advisory staff, trained under the TA,\nto train members of cooperatives and people interested in forming cooperatives at the National\nCooperative  Training  Center  (100  courses  for  about  2,000  persons)  and  at  provincial\ncooperative training centers (240 courses for about 6,000 persons). Training will include advice\non how to improve existing cooperatives and create new ones, how to formulate business plans,\nand how to establish banking relationships. Since close external supervision and monitoring has\nproved vital for the success of the cooperative movement in many countries, the subcomponent\nwill  initially  also  support  consulting  and  auditing  services  provided  to  cooperatives  by", "22\ncooperative advisory staff. Cost recovery will be gradually introduced by requiring the benefiting\ncooperatives to pay for these services.\n91. Since many cooperative members feel that their cooperative is too small to effectively\ncompete with private traders, discussions are now taking place on establishing secondary\ncooperatives. Secondary cooperatives are groups of several (primary) cooperatives set up to\nconduct joint business activities, such as processing and marketing. Starting from the second\nyear of project implementation, the subcomponent will promote and assist in the setup of about\nnine secondary cooperatives in the western provinces. This will include establishing small-scale\nprocessing and marketing facilities that will help cooperative members market agricultural raw,\ngraded, and partly processed materials, and purchase inputs at more favorable prices. The by-\nlaws of the newly established secondary cooperatives will require them to repay at least part of\nthe costs of the provided facilities with the profits generated. During the first year of project\nimplementation, mechanisms for cost recovery will be developed, including provisions with\nrespect to the percentage of funds to be recovered from the secondary cooperatives, the period\nover which such recovery is to take place, the use of recovered funds to establish additional\nsecondary cooperatives, the possible involvement of a financial institution to administer the\nprovision and recovery of funds provided to secondary cooperatives, and the fees to be paid to\nthe  financial  institution.  To  improve  market  information  and  market  power  of  primary  and\nsecondary cooperatives, the subcomponent will also help establish a cooperative wholesale\ncenter at the national level that will benefit the cooperative movement nationwide. More than a\nthird  of  the  total  cost  of  this  subcomponent  will  be  borne  by  the  cooperatives  and  their\nassociations.\nv. Rural Communication Links\n92. Under central planning the rural population in the four western provinces was able to\nreceive  a  national  and  usually  a  provincial  radio  program  through  transmitter  stations  in\nGobialtay or neighboring provinces. However, with the closure of some transmitter stations and\noutdated technology of others, the people in Dzavhan, Hovd, and Urs, (except those living in\nprovincial  capitals)  are  now  unable  to  receive  radio  programs.  In  Gobialtay  the  provincial\ntransmitter station, which used to service a large part of the western region, is now only\nproviding a local frequency. It is operating at 50 percent of its capacity but consumes more than\n10 percent of the provincial electricity requirements. Thus the rural population in three of the\nfour  western  provinces  have  practically  no  access  to  media  even  though  most  herder\nhouseholds own a radio. According to the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI), it is more cost-\neffective in the medium to longer term to establish new transmitter stations in each of these\nprovinces, than to provide for the operating cost of running the Gobialtay station at 100 percent\nof its capacity.\n93. The subcomponent will therefore assist in setting up transmitter stations in Dzavhan,\nHovd, and Urs, which will allow the transmission of signals from the central radio station in\nUlaanbaatar, and the airing of provincial radio programs. Small studios for the production of\nprovincial programs will be established in the two provinces that do not have a studio. The\nproduction of provincial programs will be supported initially. They will include market information\nfor producers and processors, advice related to agricultural production and support services,\nweather reports, news on project activities, and other information. People with skills in managing\nthe studios are available in the provinces. The operating costs for radio programming will\ngradually be covered by advertisements. MOI, through the state-owned Radio and Television", "23\nCompany, will arrange the bidding for the procurement of the new transmitter stations, and be\nresponsible for their operation and maintenance cost.19\n94. The Government is currently changing the telephone connections from the provincial\ncapitals to Ulaanbaatar from analog to digital systems. This will allow provincial governments\nand  citizens  in  the  provincial  capitals  to  connect  to  the  Internet.  No  significant  technical\nimprovements are planned in the medium term for the telephone connections between district\ncenters and provincial capitals. Below the district level, few telephone connections are available.\nA  number  of  district  centers,  especially  those  in  remote  areas,  have  difficulty  establishing\ntelephone connections to their respective provincial capitals. To remedy this situation and to\nhelp improve the communication channels between district and provincial governments, the\nsubcomponent will also provide for the upgrading of some of the telephone connections from\ndistricts to provincial capitals. Improved communication channels will not only facilitate project\nimplementation,  but  also  stimulate  economic  activity  by  providing  advice  and  the  timely\ndissemination of vital information to and from rural areas. The Post and Telecommunication\nAuthority, an implementing agency of MOI, will be responsible for providing the upgrading.\nb. Credit Component\n95. The credit component comprises (i) a credit line for PFIs in the four western and the two\nnorth-central provinces to increase the availability of credit for agricultural purposes, and (ii)\ncapacity building for PFI staff and advice for potential subborrowers. The credit line for PFIs will\nprovide  subloans,  initially  up  to  one  year,  for  agriculture-related  activities.20  The  capacity\nbuilding activities are based on the experience of the ADB-financed Employment Generation\nProject,21 which showed that, even in times of banking difficulties, adequate advice to PFIs and\nsubborrowers can help to improve loan quality and significantly increase repayment rates.\ni. Credit Line\n96. Banking and financial sector problems have resulted in limited financial services being\navailable outside the major urban areas of Mongolia. The subcomponent aims to address this\nsituation by making a credit line of $5.5 million equivalent available for PFIs in the six provinces.\nADB  will  finance  $4.4  million  equivalent,  and  the  PFIs  will  be  required  to  contribute  the\nremaining $1.1 million equivalent, or 20 percent of the credit line, from their own resources. To\navail of this credit, financial institutions, including commercial banks and nonbank financial\ninstitutions (NBFIs), will have to meet certain eligibility criteria as described in Appendix 6. The\ncriteria include that PFIs should have a rural branch network and BOM approval to lend in at\nleast one of the six provinces, be financially sound and meet BOM's prudential requirements,\nhave an acceptable record of lending to the agriculture sector, and have adequate staff for the\nprudent management of project funds. The financial institutions that may meet these criteria are\nthe Agricultural Bank, Post Bank, ZOOS Bank, and Erel Bank, and one NBFI, Credit Mongol.\n97. The Agricultural Bank has branches in the provincial capitals of Darhan-Uul, Dzavhan,\nUrs, and Gobialtay, and subbranches in most of the district centers. The bank plans to start\nagain with lending activities toward the end of 2000, initially with relatively small loans up to\nMNT1 million and with terms up to 6 months. The Post Bank has branches in the capitals of all\n                                                          \n19MOI indicated that the provincial broadcasting network, including in Dzavhan, Hovd, and Urs, may be expanded\nwith the assistance of another funding agency. In this case, the costs allocated for the provision of three transmitter\nstations would be reallocated to upgrade provincial telephone connections.\n20The Rural Finance Project planned for 2001 will address the broader issues for expanding the availability of\nfinancial services in rural areas, including the promotion of nonbank financial institutions.\n21Loan 1290-MON: Employment Generation, for $3.0 million, approved 16 December 1993. The project completion\nreport was submitted to the Board on 30 June 2000.", "24\nsix provinces, and subbranches in most of the districts in Hovd and Selenge. Toward the end of\n2000,  the  Post  Bank  plans  to  start  lending  from  its  rural  branches  in  selected  provinces,\nincluding Dzavhan, Hovd, and Selenge, with loans up to MNT5 million. The ZOOS Bank, Erel\nBank, and Credit Mongol have branches in at least one of the six provinces, and are currently\nlending to rural clients, mostly to agricultural marketing and processing companies. On average,\nthese  financial  institutions  provide  short-term  loans  amounting  to  MNT5  million  to  MNT15\nmillion. Their experience with repayment has been good.\n98. In the absence of an adequate benchmark, the interest for loans from the Government to\nthe PFIs will be determined on the basis of a formula that includes allowances for the cost of\nfunds, administrative costs, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, and inflation. Currently\nthis implies a rate of 10 percent per year, which is in line with the cost of funds to commercial\nbanks.  The  subloans  will  be  denominated  in  togrog,  and  interest  rates  will  be  market\ndetermined. The current interest rates charged by commercial banks for loans denominated in\ntogrog range between 2.5 and 5.0 percent per month, and have been recently declining. Many\nof the cultivators, herders, and cooperative members have indicated that access to credit with a\nreliable financial institution was more important to them than a low interest rate.\n99. The maturity of loans to the PFIs will initially not exceed one year; they will be equivalent\nto the maximum term of subloans to subborrowers. The PFIs will bear the risk of their onlending\ndecisions, and will assume responsibility for setting interest rates and terms and conditions of\nthe subloans. Since the focus of the credit component is on improving access to credit for the\nagriculture sector, subloans will be provided for activities that are primarily agriculture related\nand primarily based in one of the six provinces. The criteria for selecting subborrowers are\ndescribed in Appendix 6.\nii. Capacity Building for PFIs and Subborrowers\n100. Most banks and NBFIs do not have much lending experience in the agriculture sector,\nexcept to some larger marketing and processing enterprises. While some in-house training is\nbeing conducted in several of the banks and NBFIs, it has not focused on serving agricultural\nclientele,  especially  small-  and  medium-size  agricultural  producers  and  processors,  and\ncooperatives. Similarly, the majority of the rural population has experience only with a very\nlimited  range  of  financial  services  and  is  interested  in  learning  more  about  intensifying\nrelationships  with  financial  institutions  and  benefiting  from  improved  savings  and  credit\nopportunities.\n101. The subcomponent on capacity building will therefore help strengthen lending operations\nin the PFIs' branches in the six provinces. This will include the organization of training at the\nBankers Training Institute22 in Ulaanbaatar (two courses with about 50 participants). But most of\nthe training will be conducted at the provincial level for the relevant provincial PFI staff. The\ntraining will incorporate issues related to the internal requirements of the PFIs, but will mainly\nfocus on serving the needs of potential subborrowers in the agriculture sector. During the first\nthree years, the subcomponent will support a sequence of 12 courses in each provincial capital,\neach for about 35 staff of branches and subbranches involved in credit operations (courses for\nDarhan-Uul and Selenge will be organized and executed jointly). The courses will include\nmethods for identifying potential agricultural subborrowers and maintaining relations; minimum\nstandards for loan applications and business plans; loan appraisals; administration of loans;\nlinkages  between  lending  operations  and  savings  mobilization;  cooperation  between\nsubbranches, branches, and head offices; and performance evaluations of credit officers. The\n                                                          \n22The  Bankers  Training  Institute  was  established  under  Loan  1510-MON:  Upgrading Skills and Systems of\nCommercial Banks, for $3.0 million, approved on 16 December 1996.", "25\nsubcomponent will provide for an international and five domestic rural credit experts (one for\neach of the four western provinces and one for the two north-central provinces) who in close\ncooperation with the commercial banks and NBFIs will supervise the training, and provide\nfollow-up and additional on-the-job training for the participants.\n102. The Project will also offer training and advisory services to potential subborrowers in the\nsix  provinces  to  identify  viable  business  opportunities,  prepare  business  plans,  apply  for\nsubloans, and effective use of financial resources. Since such services have not been available\nin rural areas, the rural credit experts will carry out a training needs analysis and design a\ncurriculum for training courses. Course provision will be subcontracted to local service providers\nor NGOs. PFI staff from branches and subbranches will provide input to the training courses.\nThe attendance of a training course will be a prerequisite for a subborrower's loan application.\nThe selected service providers will receive a setup allowance to upgrade basic facilities and\nphysical infrastructure, and a fee for services provided. Starting in the third year of project\nimplementation, potential subborrowers will be expected to pay for the services. About 10,000\npotential subborrowers will be trained under the subcomponent\nc. Project Management Component\n103. The component will support the efficient management of project activities at the national\nand provincial levels. At the national level, a project management unit (PMU) within MFA will be\nresponsible for overall project coordination and implementation. The day-to-day implementation\nof  activities  will  be  supervised  by  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  established  in  the\nprovincial governments of the four western provinces. The project management component will\nprovide training and equipment to assist in setting up and operating the PMU and PIUs. The\ncomponent  will  also  cover  a  PMU  director,  an  implementation  officer,  an  accountant,  a\nprocurement officer (for procurement and office management), and a driver in the PMU; and a\nPIU  director,  an  implementation  officer,  an  office  assistant  (procurement  and  office\nmanagement),  and  a  driver  in  each  of  the  PIUs.  In  addition,  the  component  will  fund  an\ninternational project adviser attached to the PMU. Activities will be supported at the national and\nprovincial levels to improve monitoring and evaluation systems for project implementation, and\nfor agricultural purposes in general.\n2. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n104. The total cost of the Project is $13.1 million equivalent. The foreign exchange cost is\n$6.6 million equivalent, and the local currency cost $6.4 million equivalent. The proposed ADB\nloan of $10.0 million equivalent, denominated in Special Drawing Rights, will finance about 77\npercent of the total Project cost, covering 90 percent of direct and indirect foreign exchange\ncost, and 63 percent ($4.0 million equivalent) of the local currency costs. Of the remaining $3.1\nmillion equivalent of Project costs (24 percent of the total), $1.3 million equivalent will be funded\nby the national and provincial governments. In addition, the PFIs will provide contributions of\n$1.2 million equivalent, and cooperatives $0.6 million equivalent. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the\ncost estimates and financing plan. Details are presented in Appendix 7 and Supplementary\nAppendix  C.\n105. The proposed level of ADB financing, including 63 percent of the total local currency\ncost, is considered reasonable. Mongolia continues to face economic uncertainties and budget\npressures.  The  proposed  level  of  ADB  financing  is  also  justified  considering  the  Project's\nemphasis on poverty reduction, and capacity building at national and local levels.", "26\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n($ \u2018000 equivalent)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Social and Environmental Measures\n1. Social Analysis\n106. The ASDP will both directly and indirectly address the needs of vulnerable groups, such\nas households with small herds, households headed by women, and the unemployed. Support\nfor the Green Revolution Program will directly address the needs of vulnerable groups in the\nprovincial and district centers, where unemployment is high. The provision of training, access to\ntechnical  knowledge,  inputs,  and  market  information  will  open  up  income-generating\nopportunities in horticulture production, as well as in agroprocessing, which will help diversify\nincome sources and extend opportunities beyond the short growing season. Women, who have\nbeen shown to be the first to take up horticultural and small-scale agroprocessing activities, and\ntheir households will be the principal beneficiaries in terms of improved nutrition and income.", "27\n107. Support for private veterinarians will be of direct benefit to herder households with small\nherds by providing improved access to veterinary care and general animal production advice, as\nveterinarians broaden their expertise. This will improve the animal health situation and thus\nincrease herd productivity. The assistance for veterinary epidemiology and disease surveillance\nwill strengthen vaccination programs to the benefit of animal owners, while investment in the\nquality of inspection at abattoirs and meat processing plants will contribute towards opening up\nmarkets for meat exports, leading to increased off-take and better prices for herder households.\n108. Support for cooperative development and associated marketing infrastructure under the\ninvestment Project will strengthen the productive capacity and bargaining power of households\nwith small herds who are some of the poorest people in the country. Cooperative development\nis an area with great potential for directly raising herder households' incomes by increasing their\nshare of market price and value added.\n109. The capacity building for staff of PFIs in rural areas and for potential subborrowers, as\nwell  as  the  provision  of  a  credit  line  will  facilitate  the  access  of  agricultural  producers,\ncooperatives, and small- and medium-sized enterprises to credit, initially for up to one year. The\nsubloans are expected to mainly help finance the additional inputs necessary for improving\nproductivity and incomes in the extensive livestock and crop subsectors, and the working capital\nneeded by cooperatives to get more involved in marketing and processing activities. Vulnerable\ngroups  are  most  likely  to  benefit  from  the  improved  credit  availability  as  members  of\ncooperatives. By helping to establish relationships of rural households with financial institutions,\ntheir savings will gradually be mobilized, making them less dependent on livestock as a means\nof saving and, as a result, less vulnerable to natural disasters.\n110. The extension of the credit component to the north-central region will enable wheat\nfarmers to buy more inputs and increase output and productivity. This will help to strengthen the\nnational food security situation with respect to wheat which is the principal staple food. By\nsupporting the Government's food security goals and emergency stock management, this will\nalso safeguard the purchasing capacity of the poor in urban areas.\n2. Environmental Analysis\n111. Environmental  implications  of  both  the  ASDP  policy  reforms  and  the  investment\ncomponents were reviewed. An assessment of the anticipated environmental impact of the\npolicy measures is provided in Supplementary Appendix D. No significant negative effects were\nidentified. Positive environmental impacts are anticipated from a more efficient allocation of\nresources, and improved support services, which will contribute to sustainable grazing systems.\n112. An initial environmental assessment was undertaken for the components under the\ninvestment  Project.  The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in  Supplementary\nAppendix E. None of the activities is expected to have a significant adverse impact on the\nenvironment. Some will have a positive impact, including well rehabilitation, which is closely\nlinked with the TA on sustainable pasture management. This will help reduce livestock pressure\non overgrazed pastures and allow herder households to relocate to more favorable areas made\navailable  because  of  improved  stock-watering  facilities.  Improved  marketing  resulting  from\ncooperative  development  and  better  communication  links,  and  improved  livestock  health\nresulting from strengthened veterinary services and better water supplies will contribute to the\ndevelopment of a more market-oriented, efficient, and sustainable agriculture sector. In addition,\nincentives  will  be  provided  for  herder  households  to  substitute  their  current  strategy  of\nmaximizing the size of their herds with a strategy for improving the quality and productivity of\ntheir animals and raw materials output.", "28\nV. THE PROPOSED LOANS\nA. The Policy Loan\n1. Amount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n113. The proposed ADB loan is for $7.0 million equivalent, denominated in Special Drawing\nRights, from the Special Funds resources, and will support the ASDP policy program. The\nBorrower will be Mongolia. The loan will have a maturity of 24 years, including a grace period of\n8 years. The interest charge during the grace period will be 1 percent per annum, and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter. The loan is expected to be used over 48 months commencing\nfrom the date of loan effectiveness.\n114. The amount of the policy loan was determined on the basis of the costs of structural\nreforms under the ASDP. These are estimated at $8.0 million over the next four years, and will\nprimarily result from the following policy measures: (i) preparation and implementation of  the\nplan  to  achieve  operational  and  financial  autonomy  for  Biokombinat  ($0.4  million),  (ii)\nimplementation of the Cooperative Law and Cooperative Development Program ($0.3 million\nannually), (iii) implementation of an action plan to promote investment in disadvantaged rural\nareas ($0.4 million annually), (iv) control of animal diseases that are public health hazards ($0.3\nmillion  annually),  (v)  establishment  and  operation  of  a  licensing  system  for  veterinarians\nsupervising  meat  hygiene  and  production  ($0.1  million  annually),  (vi)  operations  of  the\nsecretariat to maintain the register for veterinarians and paraveterinarians ($5,000 annually),\n(vii) implementation of pilot programs for improved pasture management ($0.4 million annually),\n(viii)  operation  of  the  Science  and  Technology  Council  ($4,000  annually),  and  (vi)\nimplementation of a medium-term plan for extension ($0.4 million annually). Implementation of\nthe policy on risk management will also involve significant costs.\n115. The overall revenue impact of the reforms of the tax regime is expected to be close to\nneutral: the change from an exemption from the value-added tax for agricultural primary raw\nmaterials to an exemption for primary producers, with primary producers being permitted to\nregister on a voluntary basis, is estimated to have a negative impact; the replacement of the 50\npercent  exemption  from  income  tax  for  crop  farms  with  an  accelerated  depreciation  or\ninvestment  tax  credits  is  estimated  to  have  a  positive  impact;  and  the  tax  exemption  of\ncooperatives'  reserve  funds,  patronage  refunds,  and  cooperative  dividends  on  equity  is\nestimated to have a negative impact. Increased costs of the structural reforms will be partly\noffset by reduced costs, or increased revenues, induced by the reforms from (i) the more\neffective use of the financial resources resulting from the sale of commodity aid, (ii) the use of\ncompetitive bidding procedures for procurement and sales by Government agencies, and (iii)\nproceeds from the privatization of the remaining crop farms. The cost for implementing the\nrestructuring plan for the Agricultural Bank is covered under the World Bank's Financial Sector\nAdjustment Credit.\n2. Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n116. The  Executing  Agency  for  the  policy  program  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and\nEconomy (MFE). MFE will be responsible for initiating withdrawals under the policy loan, for the\nuse of the counterpart funds generated by the loan proceeds, and the monitoring of these funds.\nA steering committee, with the deputy minister of finance and economy as chair and the deputy\nminister of food and agriculture as deputy chair, and comprising representatives from BOM,\nMOI, and additional representatives from MFE and MFA (including the PMU director), will assist\nin coordinating the implementation of the policy program, which will be carried out by MFA and", "29\nother  ministries  concerned.  The  steering  committee  will  be  established  prior  to  loan\neffectiveness, and will meet as often as necessary, but at least once every three months.\n3. Procurement and Disbursement\n117. Procurement of eligible items will be on the basis of normal commercial practices for\nprocurement by the private sector or standard Government procedures acceptable to ADB for\nprocurement by the public sector. For goods commonly traded on international commodity\nmarkets, procurement will be undertaken in accordance with procedures appropriate to the\ntrade and acceptable to ADB.\n118. The proceeds of the policy loan will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost of\nitems produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries (other than those items specified\nin a negative list [Appendix 8] and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources).\nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans, approved by\nADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 16 April 1998. With each withdrawal request, the Borrower will be\nrequired to submit a certification that the value of the country\u2019s total eligible imports is equal or\ngreater than the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the loan in a given period.\nADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the\nBorrower\u2019s certification.\n4. Counterpart Funds\n119. The local currency generated by the loan proceeds (i.e., the counterpart funds) will be\nused to support the costs of the policy program. Any counterpart funds not required for the\npolicy program will be used first to finance local currency costs of other ADB-financed projects\nand, second, for general development purposes.\n5. Monitoring and Tranching\n120. The Government will monitor the implementation of the policy program, and will be\nrequired to prepare and submit to ADB quarterly reports on the implementation of the policy\nprogram, including the completion of the actions set forth in the development policy letter and\nthe policy matrix. The Government and ADB will review implementation semi-annually, and\nassess the impact of all relevant reforms on the agriculture sector in particular and the economy\nin general. This will include active policy dialogue between the Government and ADB, and\nconsultations with other major bilateral and multilateral agencies supporting agriculture sector\ndevelopment. MFE in cooperation with MFA will monitor the implementation of policy reforms\nsupported by the ASDP on behalf of the Government. Training for monitoring and evaluation in\nMFA will assist the Government in monitoring program impacts. ADB will combine its reviews of\nthe Project with a review of the implementation of the policy program.\n121. The loan funds will be disbursed in two equal tranches of $3.5 million equivalent each.\nThe first tranche will be released upon loan effectiveness. As indicated in the policy matrix\n(Appendix 4), the Borrower has satisfied five conditions prior to Board consideration. The nine\nconditions for release of the second tranche, which is expected to take place in the middle of the\npolicy loan period (expected in March 2003), are set forth in the policy matrix. The policy\nprogram also includes other conditions that ADB will require the Borrower to fulfill prior to the\nend of the program (expected in March 2005).", "30\nB. The Investment Loan\n1. Amount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n122. The total cost of the Project is $13.1 million equivalent. The proposed ADB investment\nloan is for $10.0 million equivalent, denominated in Special Drawing Rights, from the Special\nFunds resources. The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years.\nThe interest charge will be 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum thereafter.\n123. ADB will finance $6.0 million equivalent or 90 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the\ninvestment Project. ADB will also finance $4.0 million equivalent of the local currency cost. ADB\nfinancing will be about 63 percent of the total local currency cost of 6.4 million equivalent. The\ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 7.\n2. Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\na.  Executing Agency and Implementing Agency\n124. MFA will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The deputy minister of food and\nagriculture will be the national project director, and will be responsible for overall implementation\nproject  implementation.  The  implementation  of  the  subcomponent  on  improving  rural\ncommunication links through MOI will be arranged through a joint order between MFA and MOI\noutlining the respective responsibilities. MOI through the state-owned Radio and Television\nCompany will be responsible for setting up and operating the radio transmitter stations in three\nwestern provinces. The Post and Telecommunication Authority will be responsible for upgrading\nthe telephone connections. MFE will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with the Post and\nTelecommunication Authority for ensuring cost recovery.\n125. The implementation of the credit component will be arranged through a joint order\nbetween MFA and MFE, outlining the linkages between the PMU and PIUs and the capacity\nbuilding activities for PFI staff and subborrowers. The implementation of the credit line will be\nbased  on  subsidiary  loan  agreements  between  BOM  and  the  PFIs.  Each  subsidiary  loan\nagreement  will  include  terms  and  conditions  relevant  to  the  credit  line,  as  well  as  to  the\nsubcomponent on capacity building for PFI staff and subborrowers. Each PFI will then onlend\nfunds to subborrowers under onlending agreements.\nb. Project Management\n126. A PMU was established within MFA in October 2000. Under the supervision of the\nnational project director, the PMU headed by a PMU director will be responsible for the day-to-\nday coordination and implementation of project activities, including bidding for procurement and\nconstruction supervision; procurement of equipment and materials; selection, engagement, and\nmanagement of consultants; and liaison with ADB on project-related matters. In addition to the\nPMU director, the PMU will be staffed with a project adviser (international consultant for 24\nperson-months),  an  implementation  officer,  an  accountant,  a  procurement  officer  (for\nprocurement and office management), and a driver. The steering committee responsible for\noverseeing the implementation of the policy program will also give policy guidance to the PMU.\nTo monitor and review project implementation (the policy, institutional, and physical aspects),\nsupervise the functioning of the PMU, and provide necessary instructions as appropriate, the\nsteering committee will meet as and when required, but at least once every three months.", "31\n127. Under the steering committee, a working group will be established to implement the\ncredit line (Appendix 6). It will consist of a representative of MFA, MFE, and BOM; ADB will\nhave observer status. The working group will be chaired by the representative from MFA. The\ngroup will be responsible for approving PFIs, and ensuring that the approved PFIs continue to\nmeet the eligibility criteria. The working group will be established prior to loan effectiveness, and\nmeet as often as required, but at least once every three months.\n128. A PIU will be established under the provincial governor in each of the four western\nprovinces. The PIUs will supervise the day-to-day implementation of project activities in the\nrespective province. They will maintain close coordination with the PMU, be consulted on\nproject design, and be responsible to and report to the PMU. Each PIU will be headed by a\nprovincial project director, who will be a staff member of the provincial government. The PIU\ndirectors will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the PIUs. In addition, each PIU\nwill  be  staffed  with  an  implementation  officer,  an  office  assistant  (procurement  and  office\nmanagement), and a driver. Representatives from the PIUs may attend meetings of the steering\ncommittee. The PIUs will also be informed about the discussions during the steering committee\nmeetings. A PIU advisory committee will be established in each of the four western provinces to\ngive guidance to the respective PIU. Each PIU advisory committee will meet as and when\nrequired, but at least once every three months to monitor and review project implementation in\nthe respective province, and supervise PIU functioning. The PIU advisory committee will be\nchaired by the governor of the provincial government and include representatives from the State\nAdministration  Department,  the  Planning,  Budget,  and  Economic  Policy  Department,  the\nAgriculture Division, the provincial assembly, and the PIU. The PIUs and the PIU advisory\ncommittees will be established prior to loan effectiveness. To ensure that the four provincial\ngovernments perform their obligations under the Project, a project implementation agreement\nwill  be  executed  between  MFA  and  the  respective  provincial  governor  as  a  condition  for\ndisbursement.\nc. Implementation Schedule\n129. The Project will be implemented over five years, in accordance with the implementation\nschedule given in Appendix 9, and is expected to be completed by March 2006. MFA has\noverall responsibility for the project implementation, and implementation of specific activities will\nbe  undertaken  either  by  the  four  western  provinces,  which  have  executed  a  project\nimplementation agreement with MFA, or by MOI and MFE, which have executed a joint order\nwith MFA. The implementation of the credit component in the two north-central provinces will be\nfacilitated by the establishment of a credit office in the provincial capital of Darhan-Uul.\n3.  Procurement and Consulting Services\na. Procurement\n130. All  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.\nProcurement of equipment, vehicles, and furniture financed by the investment loan will be\nawarded  based  on  international  shopping,  direct  purchase,  or  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Procurement through international shopping will be undertaken\nfor  contract  packages  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  equivalent  in  accordance  with\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Small contracts with a value of less than $100,000 equivalent\neach  may  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  direct  purchase.  Local  competitive  bidding  will  be\nundertaken for contract packages for pumps between $100,000 and $300,000. The PMU will be\nresponsible  for  overall  procurement  activities,  except  for  the  procurement  under  the\nsubcomponent for improving rural communication links, which will be conducted by MOI. MOI", "32\nwill  be  responsible  for  establishing  the  radio  transmitter  stations  and  upgrading  telephone\nconnections.  MOI,  together  with  the  Radio  and  Television  Company  and  the  Post  and\nTelecommunication Authority, has enough in-house capacity to prepare the bidding documents\nand  conduct  bid  evaluation.  Appendix  10  shows  the  indicative  contract  packages  for\nprocurement.\nb. Consulting Services\n131. International and domestic consultant services will be financed by the investment loan\nfor the production and marketing support component, the credit component, and the project\nmanagement  component.  A  total  of  46  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  392\nperson-months of domestic consulting will be provided. The international consultants will have\nexpertise  in  (i)  international  classification  standards  for  cashmere  and  wool  classing  and\nmarketing,  as  well  as  for  livestock  marketing;  (ii)  water  resource  economics  and  well\nrehabilitation; (iii) rural credit; and (iv) project management. The domestic consultants will have\nexpertise in similar areas as the international consultants. They will also provide expertise in\nhorticulture production, marketing and processing, and related business practices. In addition,\nthe  investment  loan  will  provide  for  a  training  contract  (for  10  person-months)  under  the\nsubcomponent for veterinary services, covering the areas of veterinary meat inspection and\nabattoir hygiene, veterinary epidemiology, and veterinary diagnosis. The investment loan will\nalso provide two service contracts: one for providing advice to horticulture producers under the\nsubcomponent on the Green Revolution Program, and one for carrying out training for potential\nsubborrowers under the subcomponent on capacity building for PFIs and subborrowers.\n132. The international consulting services, including the training contract, will be provided by\na  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The  domestic\nconsultants, including the local providers under the two service contracts, will be recruited by\nthe firm in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. In selecting and engaging the\nconsultants for item (iii) and the provider under the service contract for carrying out training for\npotential subborrowers, MFA will consult with MFE. The terms of reference and the schedule for\nconsulting  services  are  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  consultants  and  service\nproviders financed by the investment loan will work in close consultation with the consultants\nfinanced by the attached TA.\n4. Disbursement\n133. To expedite disbursement of loan proceeds, the Project will utilize two imprest accounts\n(in dollars). The account for the activities of the production and marketing support component\nand the subcomponent on capacity building for PFIs and subborrowers will be established at a\ncommercial bank. The account for the credit line will be established at BOM. The accounts will\nbe established immediately after loan effectiveness. The initial amount to be deposited in each\nis not expected to exceed $200,000 equivalent. The imprest accounts will be established,\nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook,\nand detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB.\n134. Statement of expenditure procedures will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures\nunder the Project, and to liquidate advances provided to the imprest accounts in accordance\nwith procedures satisfactory to ADB and consistent with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nEach individual payment reimbursed or liquidated under the procedures will not exceed $50,000\nequivalent for each item of expenditure. The disbursement procedures for the credit line are\noutlined in Appendix 6.", "33\n5. Anticorruption\n135. During project processing, ADB's anticorruption policy was explained to Government\nofficials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was recently added to\nADB's Guidelines for Procurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors\nto observe the highest standards of ethics in procuring and executing ADB-financed contracts,\nand the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption provisions\nadded to ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were also discussed. The ability of MFA\nto prevent potentially corrupt practices will be enhanced by the capacity building activities\nprovided under the project management component.\n6. Project Reviews\n136. ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  semi-annual  reviews  during  project\nimplementation,  taking  into  account  the  lessons  from  ADB's  operational  experience  with\nagricultural projects in other transition economies in Central Asia, which showed the need for\nclose  monitoring  during  project  implementation.  The  reviews  will  include  evaluation  of  the\nproject scope, implementation arrangements, achievement of scheduled targets, progress on\nthe agenda for policy reform, and capacity-building measures.\n137. In addition, ADB will conduct a midterm review about 30 months after loan effectiveness.\nSenior officials from MFA, MFE, BOM, and MOI will participate in the review. The PMU will be\nresponsible for preparing a document outlining accomplishments and problems, which will be a\nbasis for discussion at the midterm review. The midterm review will enable the Government and\nADB to evaluate the progress with project implementation, to assess the initial impact of the\nProject and, if required, to make adjustments in implementation arrangements for the remaining\nProject period.\n7. Reports\n138. MFA will provide ADB with all reports and information that ADB may reasonably request\nconcerning (i) the investment loan and the expenditure of the proceeds thereof at the national\nand provincial levels; (ii) the policy reforms; (iii) MFA management and operations, and its\nrelevant agencies; (iv) the projected annual disbursement schedule for the investment loan; and\n(v) any other matters relating to the investment loan. MFA will furnish brief monthly reports and\ndetailed quarterly progress reports to ADB on project implementation and overall operation and\nmanagement. The quarterly reports will be submitted no later than 30 days after each quarter\nand should include progress made and problems encountered during the quarter under review,\nsteps taken or proposed to be taken to remedy these problems, and the proposed program of\nactivities and expected disbursements during the following quarter. In addition, MFA will prepare\nand submit a project completion report to ADB within three months after the closing date of the\ninvestment loan in a format acceptable to ADB. All reports will be submitted in English.\n8. Accounts and Audit\n139. MFA will maintain records and accounts in accordance with sound accounting principles,\nand  sufficiently  detailed  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  by  the  proceeds  of  the\ninvestment loan and to disclose the use thereof under the Project. These principles are detailed\nin the Project Accounting Manual, which was prepared23 to record activities for all ADB-funded\nprojects in Mongolia. The accounts (including financial statements, statements of expenditure,\nand  imprest  account  records)  will  be  audited  annually,  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing\n                                                          \n23TA 2993-MON: Capacity Building in Project Accounting in Mongolia, for $150,000, approved on 10 March 1998.", "34\nstandards by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. Provisions have been made\nunder the investment loan to finance the cost of auditing. MFA will submit certified copies of\naudited accounts and financial statements and the report of the auditor within nine months from\nthe close of each fiscal year. MFA will provide ADB with additional information concerning\naccounts and financial statements and their audit as ADB may reasonably request from time to\ntime.\n140. Separate accounts will be maintained for the imprest accounts; these will be audited\nannually and the accounts submitted to ADB. ADB reserves the right to undertake an audit of\nthese accounts at any time. In addition, under the subsidiary loan agreements between BOM\nand each of the PFIs, the PFI will be required to maintain full records relating to the subloans\nprovided, for at least five years after the subloan is given. The PMU and ADB may review and\naudit these records on a random basis.\n9. Monitoring and Evaluation\n141. The Government will ensure that a comprehensive program for project monitoring and\nevaluation, acceptable to ADB, is carried out to systematically generate input and output data\nfor each investment subcomponent. This will include socioeconomic and environmental data to\nmonitor and measure project impacts. A set of indicators and the necessary baseline data will\nbe developed at the beginning of the Project by the staff and consultants of the PMU and PIUs,\nin consultation with the PFIs, cooperative associations, and other local stakeholders. The PFIs\nwill provide data on credit line beneficiaries, and the cooperative associations on beneficiaries of\ncooperative development. MFA's Information, Monitoring, and Evaluation Department will work\nclosely with the PMU, and receive PMU support and training to ensure that monitoring and\nevaluation  activities  continue  beyond  project  implementation.  Similarly,  the  PIUs  in  each\nprovince will provide support and training for monitoring and evaluation at the provincial level.\nAnnual monitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared by each PIU, and consolidated and\nsubmitted to ADB through the PMU.\n142. Regarding the credit line under the credit component, the working group, together with\nADB, will conduct reviews six months and twelve months after the date when the first subsidiary\nloan  agreement  with  a  PFI  is  executed.  The  reviews  will  assess  matters  relating  to  the\nimplementation of the credit line, including the percentage of loan proceeds disbursed, the types\nof subborrowers and their geographical location, the uses by the subborrowers of the subloans,\nthe interest rates charged to PFIs and subborrowers, and the performance of the PFIs. The\nfindings of the reviews will be taken into account in the further implementation of the credit\ncomponent.\nVI. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n143. The  ASDP  will  be  accompanied  by  advisory  TA  to  support  Capacity  Building  in\nAgriculture. This includes assistance for training of cooperative members and for promoting\nsustainable pasture management. The TA will focus on the four western provinces. Details on\nthe TA are provided in Appendix 11.\n144. The TA component on training for cooperatives will be closely linked to and set the stage\nfor the activities planned under the project subcomponent on cooperative development. It will\nsupport  the  training  of  cooperative  advisory  staff  at  the  recently  established  Cooperative\nTraining  Center  in  Ulaanbaatar,  including  trainers,  business  advisers,  accountants,  and\nauditors. They will then assist the cooperatives in the four western provinces. The training will\nbe closely coordinated with the GTZ project on cooperative promotion, and be based on their", "35\nexperience  with  the  first  training  program  for  cooperative  trainers.  Limited  support  will  be\nprovided to improve the facilities of the Cooperative Training Center, and to set up provincial\ncooperative promotion centers in the capitals of the four western provinces.\n145. The TA component on sustainable pasture management will be closely linked with the\nproject component on well rehabilitation. Taking into account the outcomes of a previous TA\n(footnote  18),  this  TA  component  will  pilot  test  alternative  approaches  to  improve  grazing\npatterns based on pasture comanagement arrangements between government staff at lower\nlevels  and  herder  groups.  This  will  contribute  to  formulating  and  implementing  land\nmanagement plans at the district level as envisaged in the 1995 Land Law. The TA component\nwill help to identify current winter and summer pasture uses, collect information on operative\nand inoperative wells, identify and train herder groups that use particular pasture areas and\nwells, train provincial and district staff involved in land management, and explore the feasibility\nof setting up district pasture comanagement units and provincial comanagement committees to\nadvise the respective governor on formulating and implementing land management plans.\n146. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $817,100 equivalent, comprising $479,230 in\nforeign exchange cost and $337,870 in local currency cost. The entire foreign exchange cost\nand $215,770 equivalent of the local currency cost totalling $695,000 equivalent is proposed to\nbe financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government\nof Japan. The cooperatives and the Government will finance $122,100 equivalent of the local\ncurrency cost, or 15 percent of the total TA cost.\nVII. BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Expected Impacts\n1. Project Justification\n147. The Project will contribute to agricultural growth and poverty reduction primarily by\nincreasing incomes of agricultural producers. By supporting a production and marketing support\ncomponent combined with a credit component, the Project will help increase productivity and\nprofitability in herder and crop producing households in the four western provinces. In addition,\nthe credit component will support increased wheat production and productivity, as well as other\ncrop and livestock production in the two north-central provinces.\n148. By its very nature, a sector development program such as the ASDP cannot be readily\nsummed up in a singe rate of return measurement as might be the case in agricultural projects\nfocusing on a single major improvement, such as irrigation. Furthermore, any financial and\neconomic analysis for the credit component can only be indicative because subborrowers are\nencouraged to use the money they obtain for the most productive use available to them in their\nagricultural  production  and  processing  enterprises.  However,  ample  evidence  exists,  as\npresented  in  Appendix  12,  that  the  investment  Project  of  the  ASDP  will  be  profitable  for\nindividual  herders  and  crop  producers,  and  will  generate  new  wealth  for  the  economy  of\nMongolia.  Project  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines for the\nEconomic Analysis of Projects.\n2. Results of Financial and Economic Analysis\n149. The financial and economic analysis was carried out in four parts, including for the\nsubcomponents on (i) livestock production (comprising veterinary services, well rehabilitation,\nand in part rural communication links), (ii) cooperative development, (iii) the Green Revolution\nProgram, and (iv) credit to purchase improved seed for wheat production, all of which are", "36\nindependently financially and economically viable. The analyses for livestock production and\ncooperative development were done using the rate of return analysis, and the analyses for the\nGreen Revolution Program and the credit for wheat seed using other estimates of financial and\neconomic worth.\n150. Livestock production will provide significant quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits that\nwill directly contribute to the goals of agricultural growth and poverty reduction. Quantifiable\nbenefits arise because of improved production and productivity of herder households. With\nproductivity in livestock production currently very low, relatively few inputs have the potential to\nhave a major impact in the short term. This is particularly the case with improved livestock\nhealth through the use of veterinary inputs. Nonquantifiable benefits will arise from improved\ngrazing patterns made possible by the well rehabilitation subcomponent. The environmental\nbenefits resulting from reduced pressure on the pastures currently served by wells may be\nsignificant in the longer term, but are difficult to quantify based on the data currently available.\nThe financial and economic analyses focus on the quantifiable benefits to herder households,\nand yield a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 28 percent and an economic internal rate of\nreturn (EIRR) of 38 percent. The resulting net present value, discounted at 12 percent, shows\nthat about MNT3,792 million will be generated for the economy. The EIRR is higher than the\nFIRR because the value of incremental livestock production is priced at border prices, while\nmuch of the supporting services are nontraded. Results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that\nEIRRs remain high despite significant changes in key variables, including increased costs,\nreduced benefits, or a combination of adverse conditions.\n151. Through the development of cooperatives, especially secondary cooperatives, herder\nhouseholds will command higher prices for their output bringing an immediate income gain.\nHerder households will also be able to sell their animals at the end of the summer instead of\nearly in the season, so that they will be able to realize the advantage of a weight gain as a result\nof good summer pasture. The investment in cooperatives proves to be quite profitable financially\nand good economically, even with very low participation rates. The analysis assumes that\nherder households marketing through the cooperatives will be those with sufficient initiative to\ntake  advantage  of  the  productivity  gains  made  possible  by  the  livestock  production\nsubcomponents.  Thus  the  benefit  stream  is  the  increment  between  a  herder  household\u2019s\nincome with productivity gain but without cooperative marketing as opposed to the income with\nproductivity  gain  and  marketing  through  secondary  cooperatives.  Only  half  of  the  herder\nhouseholds benefiting from the productivity gains under the Project are assumed to also market\nthrough  secondary  cooperatives.  With  these  assumptions  the  FIRR  is  estimated  to  be  41\npercent,  and  the  EIRR  22  percent.  The  difference  between  the  two  arises  because  meat\nproducts from secondary cooperatives are assumed to command a quality premium at the\ndomestic market, but not at the international markets. Economic prices are thus somewhat\nlower than financial prices, and the benefit from an incremental gain is less; in contrast, the\nproject costs are not very different in the financial and economic analyses. As a result, the\nincremental net benefit in the economic analysis is only about 40 percent of that in the financial\nanalysis. Results of the sensitivity analysis shows the cooperative development subcomponent\nto remain viable even if a benefit reduction of 10 percent or a cost increase of 10 percent\noccurs.\n152. No systematic study of the Government's Green Revolution Program has so far been\nundertaken. Yet experience from Hovd province suggests that the aggregate impact can be\nsignificant. In Hovd about half of the total vegetables marketed now come from households\nparticipating in the Green Revolution Program and amount to some MNT280 million annually.\nBecause of the limited data availability, a rate of return for the subcomponent on the Green\nRevolution Program cannot be calculated. However, it is possible to gain an idea of how", "37\neffective the subcomponent must be to achieve financial and economic results sufficient to\njustify the investment. In Hovd, for example, some MNT7 million incremental annual expenditure\nis expected from the subcomponent. Thus, production must increase by only about 2.5 percent\nto pay for the incremental cost, which is considered to be achievable.\n153. Much of the credit to be made available in Darhan-Uul and Selenge is expected to be\nused  to  purchase  improved  seed,  in  the  short  term  imported  from  a  neighboring  country.\nImproved seed alone, even in the absence of other inputs, can increase yields by some 25\npercent. An analysis based on the production system common in the north-central provinces\nshows that the incremental value of wheat on a per hectare basis in financial terms is about\nthree times higher than the necessary investment in improved seed. The economic value of the\nincremental production would be somewhat higher than the financial. This is because the\nimported seed is priced at its border price, but the value of wheat at the farmgate is somewhat\nbelow  the  border  price  because  the  Government  has  been  releasing  food  grain  aid  at  a\nrelatively low price to moderate consumer prices.\n3. Impact on Poverty\n154. The poverty analysis provided in the COS indicates that poverty in Mongolia is primarily\nincome-based: the result of insufficient incomes and lack of employment opportunities, and less\nthe result of education or health deprivation, social exclusion, or other lack of assets. The failure\nof economic growth to reduce poverty is a reflection of the problem of creating broad-based\nincome and employment-generating activities.\n155. The ASDP is designed to increase the income and to some extent the employment\nopportunities of agricultural producers, both in provincial centers where poverty is highest, and\nin rural areas. In provincial centers, poverty is strongly correlated with unemployment. In rural\nareas one of the main reasons for poverty is the large number of households with small herds,\nwith 100 animals generally considered the minimum size for a self-sustaining household. By\nconcentrating the activities of the project components in four western provinces where the\nnumber of households with herds of less than 100 animals ranges from 40 to 60 percent, poor\npeople are expected to comprise at least one third of the beneficiaries.\n156. The most important subcomponents under the ASDP in terms of poverty impact are the\nsupport  for  cooperative  development  and  the  support  for  the  Green  Revolution  Program.\nAccording to information from cooperative associations, the members of cooperatives tend to be\nmostly households with smaller herds. Similarly, the target group of the Green Revolution\nProgram are vulnerable groups including households headed by women and the unemployed in\nprovincial and district centers, and households with small herds, who graze their animals near\nthese centers and need additional income sources. The ASDP policy matrix is closely linked to\nthese  two  subcomponents  and  includes  policy  measures  to  provide  for  the  necessary\nframework for the successful implementation of both cooperative development and the Green\nRevolution Program.\n157. Appendix 13 presents an overview of the poverty situation in Mongolia, and a poverty\nimpact  assessment  of  the  relevant  policy  measures  including  (i)  implementation  of  the\nCooperative Law and Cooperative Development Program, and (ii) reorientation of the Green\nRevolution Program. The analysis of these policy measures in terms of the effect on the labor\nmarket, prices, access for the poor, and transfers shows that they are anticipated to have a\npositive impact on the poor. None of the other policy measures included in the reform program\nare expected to have a significant adverse impact on the poor.", "38\nB. Risks and Safeguards\n158. A potential risk to the ASDP policy program is a delay in implementing some of the\npolicy  measures  under  the  reform  program.  The  delay  may  be  caused  by  institutional\nweaknesses or economic uncertainties. Safeguards are built into the ASDP to minimize this risk.\nA period of two years between the first and second tranches, and another two years between\nthe second tranche and the end of the program have been set to give adequate time for the\ncompletion of the policy reforms. In addition, many of the policy measures are closely linked to\nactivities proposed under the investment Project and associated TA, so that support is indirectly\nprovided for policy implementation.\n159. A  potential  risk  to  the  investment  Project  involves  the  provision  of  inadequate\ncounterpart financing. The 1999 country portfolio review for Mongolia concluded that ADB's loan\nportfolio  is  satisfactory,  with  implementation  generally  proceeding  on  schedule  despite  the\neconomic uncertainties, fiscal constraints, and general institutional weakness. The main current\nand likely continuing issue facing the efficient implementation of ADB-financed projects is the\navailability and timely release of counterpart funds. The Government requires assistance to\naddress  the  budget\u2019s  structural  problems  which  are  at  the  heart  of  the  current  budget\nimbalance. The recently approved Governance Reform Program24 will contribute to improving\npublic expenditure management.\n160. A potential risk for the credit component is the faltering of the ongoing financial sector\nand banking reform. To address this, implementation of the Agricultural Bank\u2019s business plan\nneeds to proceed on schedule. The Post Bank must undertake training to start lending in its\nrural  branches  and  subbranches.  The  inclusion  of  Darhan-Uul  and  Selenge  in  the  credit\ncomponent will allow other banks and NBFIs to qualify as PFIs. The credit component is\ndesigned to allow for flexibility for PFIs: any financial institution will be able to participate as long\nas it meets the eligibility criteria. The Government is committed to continuing the reforms and\nensuring the necessary framework to allow for the restoration of lending services in rural areas.\nThe  Second  Financial  Sector  Program  in  cooperation  with  World  Bank's  Financial  Sector\nAdjustment Credit, both approved in 2000, will help mitigate the risk of faltering financial sector\nand banking reforms.\n161. Successful project implementation will also depend on the capacity of the national,\nprovincial, and district agricultural agencies. The ASDP includes ADB's first investment project\nin Mongolian agriculture, and the second externally-funded loan executed by MFA. Experience\nwith agriculture-related agencies in other transition economies has shown that strengthening\ncapacity requires a long-term effort. Most project subcomponents include capacity building and\ntraining activities. The project management component includes assistance to MFA to improve\nmonitoring and evaluation systems.\nVIII.

Project Area\n1. The production and marketing support component of the investment Project will focus on\nfour  provinces  in  the  relatively  remote  and  poor  western  region  of  Mongolia:  Dzavhan,\nGobialtay, Hovd, and Urs. Together they comprise about a quarter of the country's land area\nand 15 percent of the population. About three quarters of the population are considered rural,\ni.e.,  they  live  outside  of  the  provincial  capital.  The  most  important  agricultural  activity  is\nextensive livestock production. About 25 percent of the national herd is being grazed in the four\nprovinces.\n2. The  credit  component  of  the  Project  will  cover  the  four  western  provinces  and,  in\naddition, the north-central provinces of Darhan-Uul and Selenge. These two provinces comprise\n3 percent of the country's land area and 8 percent of the population. Darhan-Uul province is\nlocated within Selenge province, with the majority of the population living in the provincial\ncenter. In Selenge almost 80 percent of the population is considered rural. Darhan-Uul and\nSelenge are Mongolia's most important wheat producing areas, with about half of the total area\nsown to wheat and about half of the output. An overview of the four western and the two north-\ncentral provinces is provided in Table A5.1.\nB. Role of Agriculture\n3. The four western provinces cover three ecological zones: a northern mountain steppe\nwith mixed trees and grassland, a central short-grass steppe that is almost treeless, and the\nsouthern desert steppe characterized by very sparse vegetation. The environment is generally\nharsher than in the rest of the country, with extremely cold winters and high aridity. Rainfall is\nvery erratic and ranges between 130 mm and 220 mm per year. In Gobialtay the average\ntemperature in January is -18o Celsius, and in Urs -32o Celsius. Strong winds exacerbate the\ncold winter temperatures and, periodically, some regions suffer from dzud1 causing extreme\nhardship  and  loss  of  livestock.  During  the  last  dzud  in  the  winter  of  1999/2000,  Urs  and\nDzavhan were the third and fourth most affected provinces in the country in terms of loss in\nlivestock, having lost 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively, as of 1 March 2000.\n4. Pastoral livestock is the mainstay of the population in the four western provinces. During\nthe transition period, the number of livestock increased significantly, from 14 percent in Hovd to\n29 percent in Dzavhan. Nationwide, Dzavhan has now the third largest livestock herd. Among\nthe four western provinces it has the largest herd and the highest stocking rate (in sheep\nequivalent units per hectare). The growth in the number of livestock was largely due to the\nsharp increase in the number of goats, fuelled by rising cashmere prices. Gobialtay has now by\nfar the largest goat population in the west, and takes second place nationwide. Since 1989, the\nnumber of herder households more than doubled in all four provinces. This is a reflection of the\neconomic restructuring and the lack of employment opportunities in urban areas.\n5. During the 1990s, the area sown to crops dramatically declined in the four western\nprovinces. The most dramatic fall was in the area sown to fodder crops, followed by wheat, with\nDzavhan most affected. Urs is now the only province in the west that has some remaining wheat\n                  \n1 Dzud is a generic term denoting a natural disaster during which livestock are not able to graze. There are different\nkinds of dzud including one that involves formation of a layer of ice over grazing land, often exacerbated by severe\nsnowfall.", "Table A5.1: Overview of the Project Provinces\n

In 1999 the four western provinces accounted for only 7 percent of the total sown\narea. Potato and vegetable production are slowly recovering, with Hovd being the leading\nprovince. But in terms of hectares, the area devoted to these crops is relatively small.\n6. In the two north-central provinces, livestock production is much less dominant than in the\nwestern provinces. As in the pretransition period, the region continues to be considered the\ncountry's premiere wheat producing area. During the 1990s, the area sown to wheat also\ndeclined, but much less drastically than in the western region, because of the generally more\nfavorable climate and better soils. While in 1989 the two provinces accounted for about 35\npercent of the total area sown to wheat, their share increased to about a half in 1999.\n7. No data is available on the sources of income by province, but an overview is provided\nby the Government's household income and expenditure survey of 1998. As shown in Table\nA5.2, agriculture is the main source of household income in rural areas. Income from livestock\nproducts dominates, providing close to 65 percent of income for households. Crop products\n(including horticultural products) are important for households in district centers around which\nmany of the smaller plots are located. Wages are the most important sources of income for\nhouseholds in Ulaanbaatar and provincial and district centers. However, the dominant basis for\nwage income in many district centers is agricultural production, while agricultural processing\nand services are significant in urban areas. Agricultural processing and services also provide\nthe basis of much income from commerce. The major items of household expenditure are\nagricultural products, including food, clothing, and footwear. Outside of the urban centers, these\nitems are often sourced through subsistence and barter. In rural areas, only about two thirds of\nexpenditures is monetized.\nTable A5.2: Household Income and Expenditure\n(fourth quarter, 1998)\nUlaanbaatar Provincial District Rural Total\nItem (Capital) Centers Centers Areas (Average)\nA.

Three of the four western provinces are among the poorest provinces in Mongolia, with\nHovd  being  the  second,  Dzavhan  the  third,  and  Urs  the  fifth  poorest.  According  to  the\nGovernment's income-based poverty line, the population living below the minimum standard in\nthese three provinces is 43 percent, 41 percent, and 34 percent, respectively. A main reason for\nthe large number of poor people in these three provinces is the high percentage of households\nwith  small  herds  (Table  A5.3).  Although  their  number  is  declining,  more  than  half  of  all", "63\nAppendix 5, page 4\nhouseholds with animals in Hovd, Dzavhan, and Urs have less than 100 animals, which is\ngenerally considered as the minimum size for a self-sustaining household.2 By contrast, in\nGobialtay, which is below the national average of 26 percent for people living below the poverty\nline, less than 40 percent of the households with animals have less than 100 animals. With\nabout half of the animals in Gobialtay being goats, the income per animal is likely to be higher\nthan in the other western provinces. Households with more than 200 animals are generally\nconsidered as living comfortably, and households with more than 500 animals are regarded as\nwealthy.\nTable A5.3: Distribution of Animals among\nHouseholds with Livestock in the Four Western Provinces, 1999\n(percent)\nDzavhan Gobialtay Hovd Urs\nItem Households Animals Households Animals Households Animals Households Animals\nup to 50 25.6 5.3 16.8 3.2 27.3 5.9 34.5 7.3\n51 \u2013 100 24.8 14.0 21.9 10.5 24.4 14.2 25.3 16.9\n101 \u2013 200 29.9 30.2 35.5 32.4 28.7 30.6 24.9 32.2\n201 \u2013 500 16.8 35.7 22.6 39.4 16.9 35.6 13.7 33.5\n> 500   2.7 14.8 3.2 14.5 2.7 13.7 1.6 10.1\nSource: National Statistical Office of Mongolia. 2000. Livestock Census. Ulaanbaatar.\n9. The two north-central provinces are less poor than the western provinces, with 25\npercent of the population living below the poverty line in Darhan-Uul and 16 percent in Selenge.\nThis is partly due to the fact that they belong to the central region around Ulaanbaatar where the\nmajor share of the country's economic activity is taking place. The vast majority of crop farms is\nprivatized, with most of them under single (either individual or company) ownership. In Darhan-\nUul and Selenge, about 100 wheat producing farms have areas of more than 500 hectares\n(including fallow land, which accounts for about half of the area), and many smaller farms have\nless than 500 hectares.\n10. During the last decade, relatively little economic development has taken place in the four\nwestern provinces as compared with the rest of the country. This contributed, particularly during\nthe second half of the 1990s, to an increasing migration of people to the relatively more\nprosperous central region around the capital city. In 1999, for example, 3,600 people (900\nhouseholds) with 93,000 animals from Urs moved to the central region, and 2,000 people (340\nhouseholds) from Dzavhan. As a result, the population in Dzavhan and Urs is declining, while\nthe population in provinces like Selenge and Darhan-Uul is increasing. The concentration of\nlivestock in the central region is also increasing as indicated, for example, in the sharp rise in\nthe stocking rate (sheep equivalent unit per hectare) for Darhan-Uul. While no detailed analysis\nof the migration has been carried out so far, the majority of migrants are estimated to be better-\noff herder households who want to benefit from the more developed marketing links in the\ncentral region as well as from better education and health facilities. In addition, many people\nwho come to the capital to receive higher education do not return to their home provinces as in\nthe past, but stay in the area due to better employment opportunities.\n                  \n2 In early 2000, due to deteriorating terms of trade, at least 150 animals are estimated to be needed by a self-\nsustaining herder household with no other significant sources of income.", "64\nAppendix 5, page 5\nD. Gender Issues\n11. Mongolia  is  characterized  by  high  gender  equity,  founded  in  nomadic  and  socialist\nvalues. Women are well-educated and well-represented in most occupations, and have equal\naccess to education and employment opportunities. Female enrollment is higher than male\nenrollment at most levels, including university education. During the transition period, however,\nthe economic and social independence of many women was undermined. The loss of jobs and\nthe breakdown of much of the social support system especially affected women. In rural areas\nsmall service industries often had to close, and in urban areas state service industries were the\nfirst to downsize their labor force. Women were disproportionally affected by these changes.\nCommensurate with the expansion of the private sector, the informal sector grew, where women\nnow predominate.\n12. Poverty is particularly severe among households headed by women. According to the\nLiving Standards Measurement Surveys, 63 percent of such households were poor in 1995.\nThis  ratio  decreased  to  47  percent  in  1998.  In  1998,  about  25  percent  of  the  very  poor\nhouseholds and 18 percent of the poor households were headed by women. Most of these\nhouseholds were in urban areas (44 percent of Ulaanbaatar's poor households, and 53 percent\nof the provincial centers' poor households), rather than in rural areas (24 percent of poor\nhouseholds).\n13. In the agriculture sector, there were some negative consequences for women resulting\nfrom the privatization of livestock. Prior to privatization, women in negdels worked primarily as\ndairy maids in single-species livestock units. Privatized herds are usually mixed and require\nmore  tending  and  processing  of  animal  products,  implying  more  work  for  women.  Herder\nhouseholds headed by women tend to have smaller herds than herder households headed by\nmen, because they received fewer animals when animals were privatized. Given that there are\noften no other adults in the households, herder households headed by women face labor\nshortages in critical times of the year. In addition, many of them had to sell their animals in order\nto buy food and other necessities. When animal resources are depleted, the women often are\nforced to work for wealthier herder households in exchange for food.", "65\nAppendix 6, page 1\nMECHANISMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE CREDIT LINE\nA.  The Credit Line\n1. The investment Project of the Agriculture Sector Development Program will comprise a credit\ncomponent designed to support short-term finance by providing a credit line for participating financial\ninstitutions (PFIs). The credit component will be open to participation by both banks and nonbank\nfinancial  institutions  (NBFIs)  that  meet  specified  eligibility  criteria.  The  credit  component  will  be\nimplemented in the provinces of Darhan-Uul, Dzavhan, Gobialtay, Hovd, Selenge, and Urs. The credit\nline will amount to $5.5 million equivalent. ADB will finance $4.4 million equivalent, and the PFIs will\ncontribute  the  remaining  $1.1  million  equivalent,  or  20 percent  of  the  credit  line,  from  their  own\nresources. In accordance with the implementation period of the Project, the duration of the credit\ncomponent will be five years. Utilization of the special project account beyond the fifth year will be\ndiscussed by ADB and the Government during project implementation.\n2. Under the steering committee of the Project, a working group comprising representatives of the\nMinistry of Food and Agriculture (MFA), Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE), and  Bank of\nMongolia (BOM), and with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as an observer, will be established. It\nwill be chaired by the MFA representative. The director of the project management unit (PMU) will\nserve as secretary of the working group. The working group will be responsible for approving  banks\nand NBFIs as PFIs under the credit component, and for ensuring that the PFIs continue to meet the\neligibility criteria. To participate in the credit component a bank or NBFI must receive unanimous\napproval of  the working group. The decision will then be sent through MFE to ADB for approval within\na one-month period on a no-objection basis. The working group will also be responsible for authorizing\nwithdrawals from the special project account for subloan financing, which will be disbursed by the PFIs,\nand for ensuring the subsequent loan recovery from the PFIs to the special project account.\nB.  Relending Mechanisms\n1.  Flow of Funds\n3. Following the approval of a PFI, BOM will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with the PFI.\nThe agreements with PFIs will be subject to agreement by ADB, on a no-objection basis, and will\ninclude terms and conditions relevant to the credit line. The maturity of loans to the PFIs will initially not\nexceed one year, i.e., they will be equivalent to the maximum term of subloans to subborrowers. Later\nduring  project  implementation,  the  working  group,  with  ADB  approval,  may  decide  to  extend  the\nmaturity of loans to PFIs and to subborrowers.\n4. The PFIs will onlend funds to eligible subborrowers and then refinance these from the special\nproject account. However, to expand the value of funds available and to encourage PFI participation\nand commitment to recovery, the PFIs will be required to make a contribution from their own resources\namounting to 20 percent of each subloan. Subloan approvals are expected to initially be constrained by\nthe number of financial institutions meeting the eligibility criteria and requirements to develop advisory\nand disbursement mechanisms.\n5. The PFIs will carry all credit risk and will be fully responsible for recoveries and for repayments\nto the Government. The PFIs will therefore choose the most creditworthy of the qualified subborrowers,\nnegotiate the most appropriate subloan structure, monitor the progress of each project/activity, and\nensure collection of each subloan. They will have responsibility for ensuring that subborrowers meet\ntheir obligations. The PFIs will repay to the special project account each subloan when it is collected\nfrom the subborrower.", "66\nAppendix 6, page 2\n2. Initial Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Institutions\n6. Financial institutions must have the approval for lending in at least one of the six provinces, and\nhave a branch network at the provincial and preferably also at the district level. They will be thoroughly\nexamined to ensure that they are in compliance with the eligibility criteria at the time of assessment of\neligibility. Throughout the project period, the PMU, in cooperation with BOM, will identify potential PFIs\nand undertake the first assessment. Based on that, the working group will make a decision on the\neligibility of the respective financial institution. The eligibility criteria for PFIs are shown in Table A6.\nTable A6: Eligibility Criteria for PFIs to Participate in the Credit Line\nCriteria Notes\n1. Legal Compliance\n    Licence as bank or nonbank A financial institution must be registered and licensed under the Banking Law or\n    financial institution (NBFI) under the relevant regulation for NBFIs for at least one year before acceptance as\na participating financial institution (PFI).\n2.

Ongoing Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Institutions\n7. Throughout  the  Project,  the  working  group  will  monitor  the  PFIs  on  a  quarterly  basis  to\ndetermine their continuing eligibility to participate. In addition, for continued eligibility, each PFI will be\nexpected to\n(i) have given at least 10 subloans to eligible subborrowers in the six provinces within half a\nyear after concluding the subsidiary loan agreement;\n(ii)  have extended at least 50 subloans to eligible subborrowers in the six provinces within\neach full year of implementation; and\n(iii)  have  no  more  than  10  percent  of  the  subloan  portfolio  under  the  credit  line  in\nnonperforming status.\n8. If a PFI is found to not be in compliance with the general eligibility criteria and with the ongoing\neligibility criteria, MFE, through the working group and with the prior approval of ADB, will determine\nwhether the PFI concerned (i) will prepare and implement a plan of action with the objective to reach\ncompliance with the criteria, or (ii) will be excluded from the Project. Any PFI that is not in compliance\nfor more than a quarter will be automatically excluded from the Project. If a PFI is excluded from the\nProject, the PFI will pay back to the special project account all funds made available through the\nProject.\nC.  Terms and Conditions for Relending\n9. Currently, no satisfactory benchmark has been set to determine the rate of interest for relending\nto the PFIs.1 The annual cost of funds to the PFIs will be based on the following:\n(i)  cost to the Government of ADB funds: 1 percent per annum;\n(ii)  cost of Government institutions administering the relending mechanism: allowance of\n1 percent per annum;\n(iii)  foreign exchange risk and interest rate fluctuations: allowance of 2 percent per annum;\nand\n                                                \n1 Other institutions have experienced the same problem. The World Bank\u2019s Private Sector Development loan, for example,\nuses a formula based on LIBOR. This formula is currently being reconsidered at the request of the Government.", "68\nAppendix 6, page 4\n(iv)  inflation: allowance of 6 percent per annum.2\n10. The cost of funds to PFIs will be 10 percent per year, approximately equivalent to the internal\ncost of funds of commercial banks; deposit rates currently amount to about 0.8 percent per month or\n9.6 percent per year.3 The cost of funds will be subject to review by the working group at six-month\nintervals.\nD.  Onlending Mechanisms\n11. The potential subborrowers will be previous and new customers of the PFIs in the six provinces.\nThey may be individuals, enterprises, or cooperatives. A subborrower will be required to\n(i)  be a private entity;\n(ii)  have a transparent and documented ownership structure;\n(iii)  be resident in one of the six provinces; and\n(iv)  use the subloan for a project/activity that is primarily agriculture related (production,\nprocessing, marketing, or service provision) and primarily based in the six provinces.\n12. The project implementation units (PIUs) in the provinces4 will be responsible for ensuring that\nthese conditions are satisfied. In addition, the PIUs will be required to ensure that the subloans are not\nused for refinancing or takeover loans, consumer loans, environmentally damaging projects, or the\npurchase or development of real estate.\n13. The PFI will submit a request for endorsement to the respective PIU. This request will provide\nevidence of residency and provide details of the location and type of the project/activity as well as\nevidence that the PFI is in compliance with the applicable environmental laws and requirements of\nMongolia and ADB. The request will not include any financial information. The PFI will be solely\nresponsible  for  evaluating  the  viability  of  the  project/activity  and  the  reliability  of  the  potential\nsubborrower.\n14. The subloans will operate within the approval structure of the PFIs, but approval should be\nmade as close to the subborrower as possible, preferably at the level of subbranches in the districts.\nIndividual  responsibility  and  accountability  of  PFI  staff  will  be  preferred  to  credit  committee\nresponsibility. Those responsible for loan appraisal and approval will also be responsible for recovery,\npartly to build up banking relationships, partly to relate accountability to performance assessment.\n15. Initially subloans will be for a maximum of one year, but related to revenue generation periods.\nThe onlending interest rates to subborrowers will be determined by the PFI based on the actual cost of\nlending. The subloan conditions will be sensitive to the seasonal character of agricultural activity in\nMongolia. In the first two years of their involvement in the Project, PFIs will have authority to approve\nindividual loans of up to $10,000 equivalent. Loans in excess of this will require approval by ADB. In the\nremaining three years of the Project the ceiling may be increased.

The technical assistance (TA) is closely linked to the Agriculture Sector Development\nProgram (ASDP) and will provide capacity building in two important areas that will help to address\nthe key constraints facing the agriculture sector, i.e., the lack of marketing channels and low\nproductivity,  especially  in  the  extensive  livestock  subsector.  The  ASDP  is  supporting  the\ndevelopment of the cooperative system as cooperatives offer the most promising avenue for\ncollective  action  in  rural  areas,  including  increased  income-earning  activities  by  providing\nmarketing and other services to members. The limiting factors for improving livestock productivity\nare veterinary services, water, and fodder. The investment Project will help improve veterinary\nservices through the veterinary services subcomponent, and expand water supply in pasture areas\nthrough the well rehabilitation subcomponent. Well rehabilitation is expected to open up pasture\nareas that are currently not used due to a lack of water. The distribution of water supply points is\nclosely linked to grazing patterns, and the choice of wells to be rehabilitated needs to be made by\ntaking into account the pasture use that is likely to result. The TA will provide capacity building that\nwill  be  a  prerequisite  for  the  successful  implementation  of  the  cooperative  development\nsubcomponent and the well rehabilitation subcomponent.\n2. The  sector  goals  are  to  develop  a  more  market-oriented,  efficient,  and  sustainable\nagriculture sector, and reduce poverty by providing increased income opportunities. The purpose\nof the TA is to contribute to these goals by providing capacity building in the areas of cooperative\ntraining and sustainable pasture management. The TA activities will focus on the four western\nprovinces:  Dzavhan,  Gobialtay,  Hovd,  and  Urs.  The  objectives  of  the  TA  component  on\ncooperative  training  are  to  train  cooperative  advisory  staff  who  will  then  provide  advice  to\ncooperatives on how to improve their activities, and to improve the institutional setup for providing\nincreased  advice  to  cooperatives  (which  will  be  part  of  the  subcomponent  on  cooperative\ndevelopment).  The  TA  component  covers  support  for  (i)  developing  training  programs  and\nmaterials, (ii) training cooperative advisory staff at the recently established Cooperative Training\nCenter in Ulaanbaatar, including 60 trainers and business consultants (20 from the national level\nand 10 from each of the four western provinces), and 20 auditors and accountants (4 from each of\nthe four western provinces and 6 from other provinces), and (iii) improving the facilities of the\nCooperative  Training  Center,  and  setting  up  provincial  cooperative  promotion  centers  in  the\ncapitals of the four western provinces.\n3. The objectives of the TA component on sustainable pasture management are to (i) support\nthe implementation of the 1995 Land Law, which tasks district governments to formulate and\napprove  land  management  plans  in  their  territory,  and  (ii)  by  doing  so,  pilot  test  alternative\napproaches  for  improving  grazing  patterns  based  on  pasture  comanagement  arrangements\nbetween government staff and herder groups. The TA component covers support for (i) identifying\ncurrent winter and summer pasture uses; (ii) collecting information on the use of wells, and data on\ninoperative wells (which will feed into the subcomponent on well rehabilitation); (iii) identifying and\ntraining  herder  groups  who  use  particular  pasture  areas  and  wells;  (iv)  providing  training  to\nprovincial and district staff involved in land management; (v) exploring the feasibility of setting up\ndistrict  pasture  comanagement  units  and  provincial  comanagement  committees  to  advise  the\nrespective governor on formulating land management plans; and (vi) designing and implementing\nland management plans in selected areas.\nB. Cost Estimates\n4. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $817,100 equivalent, of which the foreign exchange\ncost is $479,230 and the local currency cost $337,870 equivalent. The Asian Development Bank", "75\nAppendix 11, page 2\n(ADB)  will  finance  $695,000  equivalent,  comprising  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $215,770\nequivalent of the local currency cost. The financing will be provided on a grant basis from the\nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The grant financing constitutes 85\npercent  of  the  total  TA  cost.  The  cooperatives  and  the  Government  will  finance  $122,100\nequivalent or 15 percent of the total TA cost (Table A11).\nC. Implementation Arrangements\n5. The Executing Agency of the TA will be the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MFA). The\nASDP steering committee will also oversee TA implementation and review the TA reports. The\ncooperative associations will provide counterpart staff for the component on cooperative training,\nand the provincial governments for the component on sustainable pasture management. The\ninternational consulting services will be provided by a firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants. The domestic consultants will be recruited by the firm in accordance with\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The TA will provide a total of 160 person-months of international\n(15) and domestic (145) consulting services. Under the component on cooperative training, the\ninternational consultants include an expert for developing the training program and materials (1\nperson-month), a trainer of cooperative trainers and business consultants (2 person-months), and\na trainer of cooperative auditors and accountants (6 person-months). The domestic consultants will\nhave expertise in similar areas as the international consultants, and will also include interpreters\n(25 person-months). Under the component on sustainable pasture management, the consulting\nservices  include  an  international  pasture  management  specialist  (6  person-months),  and  two\ndomestic pasture management specialists (120 person-months).\nD. Implementation Schedule\n6. Both TA components will commence simultaneously with implementation of the investment\nProject. The component on cooperative training will be implemented in year 1 and 2, and the\ncomponent on sustainable pasture management from year 1 to 5.\nTable A11: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Introduction\n1. By  its  very  nature,  a  sector  development  program  such  as  the  Agricultural  Sector\nDevelopment  Program  (ASDP)  cannot  be  readily  summed  up  in  a  single  rate  of  return\nmeasurement  as  might  be  the  case  in  agricultural  projects  focusing  on  a  single  major\nimprovement, such as irrigation. Furthermore, any financial and economic analysis to the credit\ncomponent can only be indicative because subborrowers are free\u2014indeed encouraged\u2014to use\nthe  money  they  obtain  for  the  most  productive  use  available  to  them  in  their  agricultural\nproduction or processing enterprises.\n2. Nonetheless, ample evidence exists, as presented in this appendix, that the investment\nProject  of  the  ASDP  will  be  profitable  for  individual  herders  and  crop  producers,  and  will\ngenerate new wealth for the economy of Mongolia well in excess of the ADB cut-off rate of 12\npercent. Analyses are presented for the project components and subcomponents addressing\nlivestock  production  (including  veterinary  services,  well  rehabilitation,  and  in  part  rural\ncommunication links), cooperative development, the Green Revolution Program, and credit to\npurchase improved seed for wheat production, all of which are independently financially and\neconomically viable.\n3. The Project will contribute to agricultural growth and poverty reduction primarily by\nincreasing incomes of agricultural producers. By supporting a production and marketing support\ncomponent combined with a credit component, the Project will help increase productivity and\nprofitability  in  herder  and  crop  producing  households  in  four  western  provinces,  including\nDzavhan, Gobialtay, Hovd, and Urs. In addition, the credit component will support increased\nwheat production and productivity as well as other crop and livestock production in two north-\ncentral provinces, including Darhan-Uul and Selenge.\nB.  Project Alternatives\n4. In consultation with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MFA) and its predecessor the\nMinistry of Agriculture and Industry, various alternatives for the location and design of the\nProject were considered during project preparation. The choice of including four of the country\u2019s\nlowest  income  provinces  in  the  western  part  of  Mongolia  was  made  because  since  the\nbeginning of the transition most development has been taking place in the central region around\nUlaanbaatar. Also selecting provinces within one region allows for close consultation among\nstakeholders and joint activities, while keeping travel times and costs at a minimum.\n5. The livestock subsector dominates the rural economy of the four western provinces.\nEven though the herd size increased by more than 20 percent during the last decade, incomes\nare very constrained. This is mainly due to (i) low productivity caused by low input use, with the\nmajor contributing factors being the lack of cash and credit, limited veterinary input, and high\nstocking rates (sheep equivalent units per hectare) aggravated by a large number of inoperative\nstock-watering facilities; as well as (ii) marketing bottlenecks and the lack of market information.\nThe Project is designed to address these critical issues. The cooperative system is considered\nto be the most promising channel to improve marketing in remote rural areas because a large\nstructure of primary cooperatives is already in place and is in the process of being developed\nwith  the  support  of  the  Government  and  development  agencies  such  as  the  Deutsche\nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ).", "77\nAppendix 12, page 2\n6. In the crop subsector, the Government\u2019s Green Revolution Program has supported\nhorticultural production to improve food security and diversify incomes. In the four western\nprovinces, the activity was mainly taken up by households close to the provincial and district\ncenters where unemployment is high, and by vulnerable groups with small herds that graze\naround these centers. Especially after the livestock disaster of the winter 1999/2000, horticulture\nproduction has become an important activity for these groups to augment food reserves and to\nbarter  for  livestock  and  livestock  products,  and  was  therefore  included  as  a  project\nsubcomponent.\n7. Responding to Government concerns about declining wheat production, the Project\u2019s\ncredit component includes the two important wheat-producing provinces of Darhan-Uul and\nSelenge. This will allow wheat producers to borrow to purchase improved seed and perhaps\nsimple tillage equipment, or seed cleaners to clean seed from wheat saved by them to be used\nin the following season.\nC.  Demand Analysis\n8. The  subcomponents  addressing  the  livestock  subsector  will  result  in  additional\nproduction of fiber (cashmere and wool), hides and skins, and meat. Demand for cashmere by\nthe world market is considerable, with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) being the largest\nimporter  of  Mongolian  cashmere.  In  recent  years,  the  price  of  cashmere  has  been  very\nfavorable. Exports of cashmere increased from 400 tons in 1990 to 2,000 tons in 1999. One\nresult of the strong export demand for cashmere has been an increase in the proportion of goats\nin livestock herds leading to concerns in some areas of overgrazing since goats crop grasses\nmore closely than other livestock species. The increased production of meat arising from the\nProject is not projected to be large enough to influence domestic prices. Up until the mid-1990s,\nthe four western provinces exported meat mainly to the Russian Federation and in some cases\nto the PRC. Export of meat to the PRC is currently not permitted because it is not included in\nthe current trade agreement with the PRC. The Project will train veterinarians in international\nstandards of slaughter hygiene. Once the slaughter hygiene can meet international standards,\nexports are expected to increase, especially to the substantial Siberian market.\n9. The  Project  includes  significant  support  for  cooperatives,  especially  secondary\ncooperatives, to serve the needs of herder households in the four western provinces. This builds\non an existing widespread cooperative structure, although the cooperatives vary widely in their\neffectiveness. Almost all agricultural cooperatives are primary cooperatives whose members are\nherder households or individual herders. Agricultural cooperatives purchase agricultural produce\nfrom their members, including cashmere, sheep, and camel wool, livestock, hides, and meat,\nand sell them to mostly large processors. Cooperatives compete with rural traders from within\nMongolia and from the PRC who, especially in the case of cashmere, currently purchase at\nrelatively high prices but with little regard for product quality, and a high level of uncertainty for\nproducers.  In  this  situation,  cooperatives  can  be  successful  in  providing  marketing  with\nreasonable prices and a high degree of certainty for members. When purchasing from their\nmembers, cooperatives can take quality aspects into consideration, thereby providing price\nincentives for improving product quality. Rural households have a high demand for staple food\nitems, such as flour, sugar, tea, and household goods, which they usually obtain from rural\ntraders in relatively unfavorable barter exchanges for agricultural produce. Besides the supply of\nbasic consumer goods, cooperatives can also play an important role in organizing the supply of\nnecessary inputs for production activities, such as bulk purchase of winter fodder.\n10. Many unutilized opportunities for cooperative processing of agricultural raw materials\nremain, especially for meat, cashmere, and wool. The  cooperatives report  the  main  constraint", "78\nAppendix 12, page 3\nfor increasing their marketing and processing activities is their difficulty in accessing short-term\ncredit, although they also need substantial staff training to become more active and effective.\nUnder the circumstances, considerable demand is anticipated for the credit and cooperative\ndevelopment activities of the Project.\n11. The Project will support an expansion of the Government's Green Revolution Program in\nthe  four  western  provinces.  The  Green  Revolution  Program  is  an  effort  to  provide\nsupplementary income to low-income families through assistance with vegetable, and recently\nto some extent with fruit, production, and is active in all provinces of Mongolia. The Green\nRevolution Program in a province includes at least one agropark, which is a small area used for\ndemonstration and training. Small cultivators are instructed in how to produce vegetables used\nfor home consumption and for sale. Characteristically, the small cultivators have about 0.3\nhectares (ha) at their disposal, often in small compounds surrounding their homes. If they do not\nhave a small plot available, they may receive a land allotment from the provincial or district\nadministration. They may receive the right to cultivate the plot at no cost, or they may pay a\nsmall rental. The Green Revolution Program is extremely variable, and quite different elements\nare found in different provinces. It has, however, been quite popular, especially with lower\nincome families. In Hovd, which has the most advanced Green Revolution Program of the four\nwestern provinces, for example, out of 18,000 agricultural households in the province, some\n14,000 participate in the program to some extent. With such a high participation rate, the\nreorientation and expansion of the program supported by the Project will find a ready welcome.\n12. The credit component, a significant part of the Project, reflects the substantial demand\nfor credit from agricultural producers. When herders and crop farmers were interviewed, they\ninvariably mentioned the shortage of working capital and many mentioned a shortage of longer-\nterm  investment  capital.  In  every  interview  with  either  herders  or  crop  farmers\u2014from  the\nsmallest producers to the largest\u2014the respondents said they would borrow from a participating\nfinancial institution (PFI) if credit was available. The fact that the banking system in recent years\nhad lent little for agricultural production reflects problems of bank management and lending\nskills, not a lack of demand. The results of a study of the rural finance system funded by Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) was circulated in March 2000. The study found that\nalmost a quarter of rural households of all types had a bank account, a remarkably high\nproportion for a country at the economic development stage of Mongolia. One reason for this is\nthat an account is needed to receive pension and other social security transfers. Also, the rural\nadministration staff is paid through the banking system, and many lower level civil servants are\nalso  agricultural  producers.  The  JICA  study  also  reported  that  some  80  percent  of  the\nrespondents said they were in \u201curgent\u201d need of reliable financial services, including credit.\nManagers of local branches of both Post Bank and Agricultural Bank in the western provinces,\nand the banks and nonbank financial institutions in the north-central provinces, neither of which\nhave  been  lending  much  to  agricultural  producers  recently,  said  they  looked  forward  to\nresumption or expansion of lending in rural areas. In a workshop in Ulaanbaatar for commercial\nbanks, the financial institutions expressed an interest in participating in the Project\u2019s credit\ncomponent.\n13. Increased wheat production arising from credit for improved seeds and equipment will\nmeet a ready market. Both the area sown to wheat and the production of wheat have fallen\nsharply under the transition economy. In 1989, the area sown to wheat was 530,100 ha and\nproduction was 686,900 tons. However, this large area and production was only possible by\nbringing land under cultivation that was not able to support a sustainable wheat production\nregime, and by very large subsidies for agricultural inputs. Under the transition economy, a\nmore  economically  viable  and  ecologically  more  sustainable  wheat  production  system  has\nbecome established. By 1999, the area sown had fallen to 273,100 ha and production had", "Appendix 12, page 4\n79\ndeclined to 166,700 tons. In 2000, production  has recovered somewhat, and estimates are that\nsome 200,000 tons of wheat have been produced. The low level of wheat production and the\ncontinuing rise in wheat and flour imports to supply domestic demand has led to growing\nGovernment concern about food security and was one reason for including the provinces of\nDarhan-Uul and Selenge in the credit component. Increased wheat production arising from the\nProject  will  replace  imported  flour,  mainly  that  coming  from  the  PRC.  Per  capita  wheat\nconsumption, about 105 kilograms (kg) to 110 kg per capita in the latter part of the 1980s, has\nnow stabilized at about 100 kg per capita. This places the country\u2019s annual requirement for\nwheat flour at 240,000 tons. Flour recovery in Mongolian mills is about 73 percent, so that the\ncountry would require about 330,000 tons of wheat to satisfy its flour demand. Adding the\ndemand for seed and from the alcohol industry, the total demand for wheat in Mongolia is about\n390,000 tons a year, much beyond any anticipated domestic wheat production. Ample capacity\nexists to mill the increased production arising from the Project.\nD.  Financial and Economic Analysis\n1.  Livestock Production\n14. An analysis was conducted to determine the financial and economic rate of return to\nlivestock  production  under  the  Project.  The  analysis  was  based  on  an  indicative  herder\nhousehold model presented in Table A12.1.\n15. Major  Assumptions.  The  major  assumptions  used  in  the  analysis  of  livestock\nproduction include the following:\n(i)  All values are expressed in local currency in constant 2000 prices. Nominal 2000\nmarket prices were used in the financial analysis.\n(ii)  The prices of tradable commodities were determined as border prices based on\nmarket prices in Ulaanbaatar, and those of other commodities were based on\ndomestic market prices as of 2000.\n(iii)  The  analysis  was  based  on  a  comparison  of  the  with  and  without  project\nsituations over 20 years. An exchange rate of MNT1,075 per dollar was applied\nas the rate prevailing during project appraisal.\n(iv)  For nontraded goods and services, a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9\nwas used.\n16. The project cost estimates in Appendix 7 were the basis of the financial analysis. After\ndeducting price contingencies, estimated costs for the livestock production were converted to\neconomic prices by subtracting transfer payments and applying the SCF to all local currency\ncosts.  The  incremental  operating  costs  for  livestock  production  were  based  on  estimates\nprovided by representatives of MFA and cooperative associations.\n17. Livestock  Benefits.  Livestock  production  will  provide  significant  quantifiable  and\nnonquantifiable  benefits  that  will  directly  contribute  to  the  goals  of  agricultural  growth  and\npoverty reduction.\n18. The financial and economic analysis focuses on quantifiable direct benefits to herder\nhouseholds. Quantifiable  benefits arise because of improved production and productivity of\nherder  households.

This  is particularly the case\nwith improved livestock health through the use of drenches and dips and other veterinary inputs.\nProductivity gains are expected to be obtained by about 2,300 herder households in year 2 of the\nProject, and about 6,000 herder households by year 6 from a total of about 50,000 herder households\nin  the  four  western  provinces.  The  data  on  herder  households  benefits  and  costs  derived  from\nproductivity  gains  are  based  on  discussions  with  herders,  veterinarians,  and  representatives  of\nprovincial governments, and are relatively conservative estimates.\n19. Nonquantifiable benefits associated with the livestock production-related activities under the\nProject will arise from improved grazing patterns through the well rehabilitation subcomponent. The\nenvironmental benefits resulting from reduced pressure on pastures may be significant in the longer                  \nterm, but are difficult to quantify based on the data currently available.\n20. Table A12.2 shows the financial and economic analysis for the subcomponents related to\nlivestock production. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is estimated at 28 percent, and the\nresulting net present value (NPV), discounted at 12 percent, is MNT2,378 million. The financial rate of\nreturn to the individual herder households was not estimated directly, but is well above the financial\nreturn to the sector as a whole because several of the sector costs, including some veterinary services,\nwell rehabilitation, and rural communications links, directly benefit herders but are not expected to be\nrecovered in full from them. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 38 percent. The resulting\nNPV, discounted at 12 percent, shows that about MNT3,792 million will be generated for the economy.\nThe EIRR is higher than the FIRR because the value of the incremental livestock production is priced at\nborder prices, while much of the supporting services are nontraded.\n21. Results of a sensitivity analysis presented in Table A12.3 (p. 83) indicate the EIRRs remain high\ndespite  significant  changes  in  key  variables,  including  increased  costs,  reduced  benefits,  or  a\ncombination of adverse conditions. Switching values for the EIRR to equal 12 percent indicate that the\nEIRR is relatively insensitive either to increased costs or decreased benefits.\n2.  Cooperative Development\n22. Promotion of cooperatives, especially secondary cooperatives, is an important subcomponent of\nthe Project. Through the secondary cooperatives, herders will command higher prices for their output\nbringing an immediate income gain. Another advantage is that herders will be able to sell their animals\nat the end of the summer season instead of early in the season, so that they will be able to realize the\nadvantage of a weight gain as a result of good summer pasture.\n23.  The investment in cooperatives proves to be quite profitable financially and good economically,\neven with very low participation rates. To test the financial and economic return to cooperatives,\nthe incremental income accruing to herder households from marketing through cooperatives\nwas  taken  as  the  benefit  stream.  Herder  households  who  would  market  through  the\ncooperatives were assumed to be those who had sufficient initiative to take advantage of the\nproductivity gains made possible by the livestock household\u2019s production subcomponents. Thus\nthe benefit stream was the increment between a herder household\u2019s income with productivity\ngain but without cooperative marketing, as opposed to the income with the productivity gain and\nalso marketing through the cooperatives. Only half the herder households benefiting from the\nproductivity gains under the Project were assumed to also market through cooperatives.", "82\n Appendix 12, page 7\nTable A12.2: Financial and Economic Internal Rate of Return to Livestock Production\nYear  \nItem 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10-20\nA.

With these assumptions, the FIRR is estimated to be 41 percent, and the EIRR to be 22\npercent, as shown in Table A12.4 (p. 84). The difference between the two arises because meat\nproducts from secondary cooperatives are assumed to command a quality premium at the\ndomestic market but not at the international markets. Economic prices are thus somewhat lower\nthan the financial prices, and the benefit from an incremental gain is less. In contrast, the costs\nof the Project are not very different in the financial and economic analyses, meaning that the\nincremental benefit in the economic analysis is only about 40 percent that of the financial\nanalysis.\n25. The results were subjected to a sensitivity analysis, which is given in Table A12.5.

No systematic study of the Green Revolution has been undertaken, so any financial and\neconomic analysis is necessarily anecdotal. A more systematic study is badly needed.\n27. In  Hovd  province,  for  households  that  devote  a  substantial  amount  of  time  to  the\nprogram a typical area being cultivated is about 0.3 ha. This can produce about MNT200,000 to\nMNT250,000 worth of vegetables. The amount a household can produce depends in part on the\nskill of the cultivator and in part on the amount of family labor available.

A  Green  Revolution  household  will  spend  about\nMNT80,000 for land rent, seed, fertilizers, and pesticides and herbicides. Thus the household\nincreases  its  income  by  some  MNT120,000  to  MNT170,000  annually,  of  which  some\nMNT70,000 to MNT120,000 is in cash. In addition, most Green Revolution households have a\nfew head\u2014about 10-15\u2014of livestock, which they feed vegetable by-products and hay cut from\nnatural grass. The livestock also graze near urban centers, or are taken to high mountain\npastures in the summer. The returns from a Green Revolution plot cannot provide sufficient\nincome for a household to live on. The households must have other income. Some participants\nare pensioners, some are casual laborers, and some have minor government posts or work in\nservice industries.\n28. The impact of the Green Revolution Program in the aggregate can be significant. In\nHovd, about half the total vegetables marketed come from households participating in the Green\nRevolution Program and amount to some MNT280 million annually.\n29. The  subcomponent  on  the  Green  Revolution  Program  emphasizes  farmer\ndemonstrations and domestic travel to enable provincial staff to be able to stay in closer touch\nwith district staff, and both staffs to be able to visit participating households more often. The\nobjective is to broaden the range of crops produced by participating households, including\nlegumes, fruits, and berries, to promote improved small-scale irrigation and greenhouses, and to\nassist  households  to  improve  their  marketing  and  postharvest  processing  either  for  home\nconsumption or for sale.\n30. While  a  rate  of  return  cannot  be  calculated  for  the  Green  Revolution  Program\nsubcomponent, financial and economic justification of project effectiveness can be estimated. In\nHovd province, for example, some MNT7 million incremental annual expenditure is expected.\nThus, production must increase by about 2.5 percent to pay for the incremental cost.\n4.  Wheat Production\n31. Much  of  the  credit  to  be  made  available  in  Darhan-Uul  and  Selenge  provinces  is\nexpected to be used to purchase improved seed.\n32. The national improved wheat seed production system in Mongolia is largely inoperative.\nHelp to revive the system is being provided by the European Union Technical Assistance to the\nConfederation of Independent States (TACIS) and other assistance agencies. However, at best,\nfirst generation seed (the seed used by producing farmers to produce wheat for milling) will be\navailable in three to four years.\n33. In the meantime, if demand is sufficient, the market can supply improved wheat seed\nimported from Kazakhstan or the Russian Federation. Varieties suitable for other central Asian\nregions have been successfully used in Mongolia. Although Mongolia should not depend on\nimported wheat seed indefinitely, in the interim between the beginning of the Project and the\ntime when Mongolian improved seed can be produced for the market, imported seed can be\nused.\n34. Improved seed alone, even in the absence of other inputs, can increase yields by some\n25 percent. The basic computations for the incremental value of increased production arising\nfrom improved seed on 1 ha are given in Table A12.6.", "Appendix 12, page 11\n86\n                Table A12.6: Incremental Return Per Hectare to Improved Wheat Seed\nItem Amount\nArea Devoted to Seed Multiplication (15 percent) 0.15 ha\nSeed Needed for 0.15 ha at 200 kg/ha 30 kg\nCost of Imported Improved Seed at MNT183,000/ton MNT5,490\nEstimated Incremental Production per ha (0.8 ton/ha x 0.25) 0.2 ton/ha\nArea Planted to Wheat for Production (85 percent) 0.85 ha\nIncremental Production (0.2 ton x 0.85 ha) 0.175 ton\nFinancial Value of Wheat at Farm Gate MNT100,000/ton\nValue of Incremental Production (0.175 ton x MNT100,000) MNT17,500\nha = hectare, kg = kilogram.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n35. When  improved  seed  is  used,  the  production  system  common  in  Darhan-Uul  and\nSelenge is for farmers to purchase improved seed sufficient for about 15 percent of their sown\narea. This, in turn, is harvested and saved to provide seed for the rest of the farm in the\nfollowing year. Thus, once the process is established, farmers will buy improved seed every\nyear for 15 percent of their sown area. Improved seed currently sells for about MNT183,000 a\nton. The seeding rate is about 200 kg/ha. Thus the cost of improved seed needed is about\nMNT5,490/ha. The area planted to wheat to be sold for milling on a per ha basis is the area not\ndevoted to seed production, or 0.85 ha. The incremental production from improved seed is\nabout 200 kg. The farm-gate price of wheat is currently about MNT100,000 per ton. Thus the\nincremental value of wheat is about MNT17,500/ha and well in excess of a 50 percent FIRR.\nTherefore, an investment of some MNT5,490 leads to an incremental value of production a year\nlater of MNT17,500, or about a 3:1 return.\n36. The  economic  value  of  incremental  production  will  be  somewhat  higher  than  the\nfinancial. The imported seed is priced at its border price, but the value of wheat at the farmgate\nis somewhat below the border price because the Government has been releasing food grain aid\nat a relatively low price to limit consumer price rises.", "87\nAppendix 13, page 1\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nA. Poverty Trends\n1. Causes of Poverty. Until 1990 unemployment and poverty were virtually unknown in\nMongolia, and inequality was very low. During the initial transition period in the beginning of the\n1990s, the economy contracted sharply due to the withdrawal of Soviet assistance, equivalent\nto about 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and the breakup of the trading system\nwith the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The collapse in the\nstate budget led to drastic cuts in subsidies and welfare programs, and this pushed many\nhouseholds below the poverty line. In addition, the economic restructuring and privatization\nprocess led to severe retrenchment in public sector employment, and to the closure of many\nnonviable enterprises. Although much of the shed labor force was absorbed by the extensive\nlivestock  sector  and,  in  part,  by  the  growing  informal  economy,  underemployment  and\nunemployment rose substantially. Furthermore, the privatization program for the collective herds\nresulted in many households owning a below-subsistence herd size. With reduced state and\nprivate  income,  both  formal  and  informal  social  safety  nets  faltered,  and  poverty  levels\nincreased rapidly.\n2. Incidence of Poverty. Before 1990, poverty was not reported in Mongolia. In 1991 the\nGovernment established a poverty line based on per capita income equivalent required to meet\na daily calorie intake of 1,872 kilo calories (Kcal) per capita in rural areas, and 1,992 Kcal in\nurban areas. The income-based poverty line was adjusted each year. Based on this measure,\nthe population living below the minimum living standard level was estimated to be 16 percent in\n1991. By the end of 1998, the estimate was 26 percent. The four western provinces, with the\nexception of Gobialtay, belonged to the poorest areas, with 43 percent of the population living\nbelow the minimum living standard level in Hovd, 41 percent in Dzavhan, and 34 percent in Urs.\nThe estimate for Gobialtay was 16 percent.\n3. In 1995, the National Statistical Office in cooperation with the World Bank conducted a\nliving standards measurement survey (LSMS), and introduced an expenditure-based poverty\nline  to  meet  a  calorie  intake  of  2,100  Kcal  per  capita,  comparable  to  the  norm  in  other\ndeveloping countries. According to this survey, 36.3 percent of the population were living below\nthe poverty line in 1995. In 1998 the National Statistical Office with support of the United\nNations Development Programme carried out another LSMS based on a similar consumption\nbasket for a daily calorie intake of 2,100 Kcal per capita. According to the 1998 survey, 35.6\npercent of the population were below the poverty line, and 19.7 percent were considered to be\nvery poor.1 The key poverty indicators of the 1995 and 1998 surveys are in Table A13.1.\n4. Some  methodologies  changed  from  the  1995  to  the  1998  LSMS,  making  direct\ncomparison  of  the  two  LSMS  surveys  difficult.  Also,  the  LSMS  surveys  did  not  provide\ndisaggregated  data  by  province.  But  they  showed  that  poverty  is  a  significant  problem  in\nMongolia and includes about a third of the population. Mongolia is distinctive in that poverty\ntends to be less in rural areas than in urban areas; poverty is the highest in the provincial\ncenters. Mongolia is also distinctive as poverty is primarily income based, rather than due to\neducation or health deprivation. The failure of economic growth (which averaged 3.6 percent\n                  \n1 The 1998 LSMS divided the population into five categories based on expenditures to show how poverty is\ndistributed between different groups: (i) very poor (less than MNT11,005): 19.7 percent; (ii) poor (MNT11,005 to\nMNT14,674): 15.9 percent; (iii) not poor\u2013low (between the poverty line and 150 percent above the poverty line):\n27.0 percent; (iv) not poor\u2013medium (between 150 percent and 225 percent above the poverty line): 21.9 percent;\nand (vi) not poor\u2013upper (more than 225 percent above the poverty line): 15.5 percent.", "88\nAppendix 13, page 2\nbetween 1994 and 1998) to reduce poverty is a reflection of the difficulty of creating broad-\nbased income and employment generation activities in a transition economy.\nTable A13.1: Key Poverty Indicators\n(1995 and 1998)\nPopulation Below Number of\nPoverty Line Poor People Severity of\n(percent) (\u2019000) Depth of Poverty Poverty\nItem 1995 1998 1995 1998 1995 1998 1995 1998\nAll Mongolia 36.3 35.6 820.7 862.9 10.9 11.7 4.8 5.6\nUrban 38.5 39.4 470.5 493.4 12.2 13.9 5.7 7.1\n Ulaanbaatar 35.1 34.1 214.1 221.3 10.4 13.0 4.5 7.4\n Provincial Centers 41.9 45.2 256.5 272.1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nRural 33.1 32.6 350.1 369.5 8.9 9.8 3.6 4.4\n\u2013 = not available.\nSource: National Statistical Office of Mongolia and United Nations Development Programme. 1999. Living Standards\nMeasurement Survey 1998. Ulaanbaatar.\n5. Table A13.1 indicates an increase in the depth and severity of poverty between 1995\nand 1998. The depth is the percentage that the average poor person's income is below the\npoverty line. The severity takes into account the income distribution among the poor, giving\nmore weight to those who are most below the poverty line. This increase in the depth and\nseverity of poverty corresponds to rising inequality. Income inequality measured by the Gini\ncoefficient  increased  from  0.31  in  1995  to  0.35  in  1998,  but  this  is  still  relatively  low  by\ninternational standards.\n6. Vulnerable  Groups.  According  to  the  LSMS,  poverty  is  particularly  severe  among\nhouseholds  headed  by  women,  the  unemployed,  wage  employees  in  the  social  and\nadministrative  sectors,  and  households  with  small  herds.  These  groups  are  not  mutually\nexclusive. In 1998, 47 percent of the households headed by women were poor, a decline from\n63 percent in 1995. Households headed by women comprised nearly one fifth of all households,\nand were mostly located in Ulaanbaatar and provincial centers. By the end of 1999, the official\nunemployment rate was 5 percent, but hidden unemployment was estimated to be close to 20\npercent. The correlation between unemployment and poverty is particularly strong in urban\nareas. Due to a real wage decline, poverty is more acute among wage employees and public\nservants than among people working in the informal or agriculture sector.\n7. One of the main reasons for rural poverty is the large number of households with small\nherds. Although their number is declining, in 1999 many households with livestock still had\nfewer than 100 animals, which is generally considered the minimum size for a self-sustaining\nhousehold. In the four western provinces, the number of households with livestock that owned\nless than 100 animals was 50 percent for Dzavhan, 52 percent in Hovd, and 60 percent in Urs.\nIn Gobialtay, which has the lowest poverty level of the four provinces, only 39 percent of all\nhouseholds with livestock had less than 100 animals.\nB. Policy Actions and Their Impact on the Poor\n8. A  poverty  impact  assessment  was  conducted  for  the  policy  measures  under  the\nAgriculture Sector Development Program that are anticipated to have significant effects on the\npoor. They include (i) implementation of the Cooperative Law and Cooperative Development\nProgram; and (ii) reorientation of the Green Revolution Program.
