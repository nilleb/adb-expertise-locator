INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Declaration of the 2nd Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in \nDelhi (2007)1 endorsed the formation of the Asia Regional Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, \nto include regular reporting of information on regional disaster risk reduction (DRR) initiatives. \nThis is considered to be a key condition for achieving greater coherence and better regional \ncoordination for prioritizing DRR outputs and for providing an enabling environment to strengthen \nthe capacity of nations and communities to effectively address disaster risk. The call for more \ncoherence, harmonized approaches, and greater effectiveness accords with the report, Delivering \nas One, by the United Nations (UN) secretary general\u2019s high-level panel on UN systemwide \ncoherence.2 Similar needs are emphasized in the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy3 \nand subsequent action plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),4 and by other key donors \nsuch as the Government of Australia\u2019s report on disaster risk management needs in the Asia \nregion.5 \n2.  The ISDR Asia Partnership6 (IAP) is an interagency forum supporting the Asia Regional \nPlatform for Disaster Risk Reduction, and as a regional coordination mechanism is an appropriate \nvehicle  to  assist  coherent  regional  strategy  setting  and  programming  and  progress  reviews \nthrough improved information exchange. Following the 2007 Delhi Declaration (footnote 1), the \nIAP created a working group to explore regional stocktaking and mapping of DRR interventions,7 \nand in February 2008 transformed the working group into a project steering committee to prepare \na concept note outlining the key features of a regional stocktaking and mapping initiative, after \nwhich the proposal was forwarded to ADB for funding consideration.8 A mission was conducted \non 22\u201324 September to finalize the technical assistance (TA) with key parties. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Asia and Pacific regions are the world\u2019s most disaster prone; there are a number of \ndisaster risk hotspots in both regions, and it is expected that existing risk patterns in the region \nwill intensify as a result of climate change, urbanization, economic globalization, poverty, and \nenvironmental  degradation.  Responding  to  these  challenges,  the  Asia  region  has  witnessed \npromising developments to advance DRR at regional, subregional, and national levels. This was \nrecognized in the Beijing Action for Disaster Risk Reduction in Asia action plan in 2005,9 the first \nsession of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction in Geneva in 2007, and the Delhi 2007 \nministerial  declaration.  The  Pacific  region  has  also  made  significant  strides  following \n                                                 \n1  The 2nd Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in New Delhi, 7\u20138 November 2007, was attended \nby over 500 delegates and reviewed Hyogo Priorities of Action implementation strategies in the Asia and Pacific \nregion over the past 2 years. The conference adopted the Delhi Declaration on Disaster Risk Reduction in Asia 2007. \n2  United Nations. 2006.

Canberra (April). \n6  The IAP was formed in 2003 as an informal partnership of regional representatives of the UN International Strategy \nfor Disaster Reduction (UNISDR), the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP), UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (UNESCAP), \nAsian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC), and Asian Disaster Reduction Centre (ADRC). In 2007 membership \nincreased to more than 25 agencies, including intergovernmental and nongovernment regional and subregional \norganizations, UN agencies, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). \n7  Participating regional organizations were ADPC, ADRC, Asian Disaster Reduction and Response Network (ADRRN), \nIFRC, UNOCHA, Pacific Islands Applied Geosciences Commission (SOPAC), UNDP, and the World Bank. \n8  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 January 2008.  \n9  Convened in Beijing on 27\u201329 September 2005. The action plan was developed to enhance regional cooperation in \nthe implementation of the Hyogo Framework of Action (HFA). \n ", "2   \nendorsement of the Pacific Regional Framework for Action 2005\u2013201510  by Pacific leaders, and \na  program  of  disaster  risk  management  national  action  planning  to  adapt  the  Regional \nFramework was pursued. \n4.  The influx of financial resources after the December 2004 tsunami increased the number \nof DRR and recovery initiatives, and brought new participants into the region. Although this brings \nfresh impetus, it has added to the complexity and has complicated coordination and collaboration. \nRegional partners, donors, and governments have identified a need for more coordination and for \nincreased transparency as to who is doing what and where in DRR within the Asia and Pacific \nregion. This stocktaking and mapping proposal will address the issue. \n5.  DRR stocktaking and mapping initiatives are not new to the Asia and Pacific region, which \nhas spearheaded a number of actions.11 There are also global and regional initiatives focusing on \nhazard  and  vulnerability  information  undertaken  by  the  Global  Risk  Identification  Platform \n(producing risk assessments), UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ([UNOCHA], \nRisk Assessment Analysis for Asia Pacific, and the Relief Web); the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (a disaster events database and website), and the Pacific Disaster Center (hazard \nand  vulnerability  atlas).  Even  so,  these  have either  been  (i)  one-off  exercises not  regularly \nupdated; (ii) not comprehensive in thematic or regional coverage, with gaps making it difficult to \nestablish links; or (iii) not commonly known and inaccessible to the wider DRR community. The \nproposed project will build on these efforts and learn from their strengths and shortcomings. The \nproject  will  consider  all  existing  sources  of  information  on  various  crosscutting  themes, \ncomponents,  and  subjects  related  to  disaster  risk  reduction,  including,  where  appropriate, \ninformation pertaining to climate change, especially in the area of adaptation. It will capture \nregional DRR initiatives by various regional organizations, intragovernmental agencies, and UN \norganizations since 2005 as well as past, ongoing, and planned activities (2005\u20132009).12 \n6.  This  coordinated  DRR  stocktaking  and  mapping  project  will  present  an  overview  of \nongoing and planned DRR interventions13 within the broader context of a regional disaster risk \nprofile. The information will contribute to improved regional planning and programming, and will \nhighlight areas for cooperation among regional and subregional organizations. It will add to \nperiodic progress reviews and reporting processes at regional and subregional levels (such as \nthe biennial Hyogo Framework for Action [HFA] progress reviews and preparation of the 2009 UN \nGlobal Assessment Report). It will also assist donor agencies and decision makers channel \nresources and efforts to meet their own policy and program imperatives while implementing DRR.  \n7.  The primary beneficiaries of this project will be regional stakeholders in DRR\u2014such as \nUN  agencies,  intergovernmental  organizations,  research  and  technical  organizations, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  especially  IAP  members\u2014who  will  use  the  results  for \nenhanced  regional  planning,  programming,  and  cooperation.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be coordinated support to regional stakeholders in DRR efforts \nof national governments, and a more coherent approach to cross-border and regional DRR \nchallenges. The expected outcome is the preparation of a comprehensive overview of regional \nDRR interventions presented within a framework of a regional disaster risk profile for the Asia and \nPacific region. The stocktaking will improve (i) information sharing on past, ongoing, and planned \nDRR initiatives for 2005\u20132009; (ii) coordination and program planning by regional stakeholders; \n(iii) the use of resources; (iv) the level of duplication; (v) the sharing of lessons learned; and (vi) \nthe identification of gaps in regional DRR efforts. An online tool will be developed and hosted on \nthe  website  of  the  Asian  Disaster  Preparedness  Center  (ADPC)  and  other  interested  IAP \nmembers, and it will also be linked to the UNISDR Prevention Web. In addition, as IAP members, \nUNISDR and ADPC are committed to maintaining this system and mobilizing additional resources \nrequired for maintenance, which will be lower than the cost of establishment. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nB.  Methodology and Key Outputs \n9.  The TA has the following three key outputs: \n(i)  An inventory of risk assessments describing the wider context in which regional \ninitiatives are undertaken and, depending on availability, an inventory of data on \ndisaster vulnerability and hazards. \n(ii)  A stocktaking of regional DRR interventions in the Asia and Pacific region by \nregional organizations for past (from 2005), present, and upcoming interventions. \n(iii)  Preparation of an interactive knowledge map allowing easy updates by regional \npartners. \n \n10.  To achieve these outputs, the following key activities have been identified: \n(i)  For output 1, a regional risk inventory which will (a) identify and review available \nsources and information on hazards,15 vulnerability, and risks; and (b) be based on \nthe  collated  information,  prepare  an  analytical  overview  of  the  regional  risk \npatterns, and highlight potential information gaps. \n \n(ii)  For output 2, a regional stock take which will (a) determine the scope of work by \nconducting a study on existing regional initiatives on DRR stocktaking; (b) develop \na work plan for information collection on DRR interventions from various regional \nagencies  after  considering  the  desk  survey  report  and  inputs  of  the  steering \ncommittee members; (c) prepare a data collection template and engage wider \n                                                 \n14 The HFA was agreed upon at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, Japan in 2005, and later \nendorsed by the UN General Assembly. Based on the experience and knowledge of countries most affected by \nnatural hazards, it lays out a detailed set of priorities to reduce disaster losses to be achieved by 2015. \n15 Since the inventory will collect material on major natural hazards affecting the region, sources and information \npertaining to climate change adaptation will be included, hence supporting regional, and ADB\u2019s, efforts in this area. \n ", "4   \nparticipation after consultations with IAP steering committee members; (d) collect \nand update information from data sources and organizations active in the Asia and \nPacific region; (e) organize two regional workshops\u2014a regional training workshop \nto introduce and finalize the data collection templates, and a regional stakeholder \nworkshop to review and complete the findings of the stocktaking exercise; (f) \nprepare  a  consultative  version  of  the  document  on  DRR  interventions  in  the \nsubregions of Asia and the Pacific and submit it to the IAP steering committee; and \n(g)  submit  a  draft  report  to  the  IAP  steering  committee  and  publish  the  final \noutcome. \n \n(iii)  For output 3, an interactive knowledge map which will (a) seek feedback from the \nsteering committee members16 Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission \n(SOPAC), and the World Bank and technical group to prepare a template for an \ninteractive knowledge map to update information; (b) develop, host, and allocate \nserver space for the online tool to collect and reflect the information collated on \nhazard and vulnerability information and regional DRR initiatives; (c) develop maps \nand charts based on the analysis of information from the stocktaking of regional \nDRR  initiatives;  and  (d)  link  the  interactive  knowledge  map  to  the  UNISDR \nPrevention Web and develop a regular update strategy. \n \n11.  The analytical framework of the stocktaking will be guided by the HFA. The five priorities \nfor action described in the HFA are to (i) ensure DRR is a national and local priority with a strong \ninstitutional basis for implementation; (ii) identify, assess, and monitor disaster risks, and enhance \nearly warning; (iii) use knowledge, innovation, and education to build a culture of safety and \nresilience  at  all  levels;  (iv)  reduce  the  underlying  risk  factors;  and  (v)  strengthen  disaster \npreparedness for effective response at all levels.   \n12.  The methodology for data collection will be developed through this TA, and will embrace \nthe following principles. It will (i) provide broad and inclusive overview of the information on DRR \nand related initiatives, (ii) record information in a neutral and uncontroversial manner, (iii) build on \nand add to the existing stocktaking and mapping initiatives, (iv) adopt a user friendly approach to \nencourage participation for information sharing and access, (v) develop a sustainable tool which \nwill serve to update information periodically in the region, and (vi) focus on regional initiatives. \nThe methodology will be based on a range of tools and methods for data collection, including (i) \nnetworks  analysis,  (ii)  web-based  and  online  databases,  (iii)  desk  studies,  (iv)  participatory \napproaches that involve information providers through workshops, (v) telephone interviews, (vi) \ncompetency mapping, and (vii) questionnaires.  \n13.  Information collection will initially be limited to regional initiatives. Once the system is \nsufficiently  developed  and  databases  and  maps  have  been  populated,  the  project  can  be \nexpanded and a follow-up phase could be commissioned to record national initiatives for selected \nor  all  countries.  Information  collection  will  also  include  subregional  and  sector  studies  and \nsurveys. Information collation and storage in relation to each HFA priority of action may be broken \ndown by region and/or subregion. A thematic approach may be pursued (e.g., urban disaster risk, \nDRR governance systems, or climate change adaptation). A decision on the type of information \nwill  be  made  at  the  project  implementation  phase  in  conjunction  with  the  project  steering \ncommittee and implementing partners. \n \n                                                 \n16 The steering committee members are: ADB, ADPC, ADRC, ADRRN, IFRC, SOPAC, UNISDR, UNOCHA, UNDP, \nand World Bank. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is $400,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development Department, Capacity Development and \nGovernance Division, will have overall responsibility for the TA. ADB will appoint the Asian \nDisaster  Preparedness  Center  (ADPC)  to  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA).  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented by the ADPC under the auspices of the IAP. Specific components of the TA may be \nsubcontracted to members of the IAP depending on the expertise required, and will be decided \nafter consultation with the IAP members during the inception stage of the TA. The EA will be \nguided by a project steering committee chaired by the Bangkok office of the UNISDR, and \nconsisting of the following IAP members: ADB, ADPC, ADRC, ADRRN, IFRC, SOPAC, UNDP, \nUNOCHA,  and  World  Bank.  This  committee  will  have  the  following  functions:  (i)  to  identify \nsuitable implementing agency(ies), (ii) to provide overall guidance and technical and advisory \nsupport to the EA and subcontractors, (iii) to monitor project implementation and progress, (iv) to \ntake decisions on project direction, (v) to share progress reports and results with the wider IAP, \n(vi) to establish links with information providers and other key stakeholders, (vii) to contribute own \ninformation to the stocktaking initiative, and (vii) to capture and disseminate lessons. \n16.  ADB will enter into a letter of agreement with ADPC, which (i) will administer the TA funds \nand make all related organizational and administrative arrangements, (ii) engage consultants for \nspecific components as required, (iii) disseminate the TA outputs, (iv) prepare project progress \nreports, and (v) prepare an audited financial report. The EA may subcontract parts of the TA to \nimplementing partners. The TA funds will be released as specific project milestones are reached. \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.17  \n17.  TA implementation will start in December 2008 and end in June 2010. The EA will prepare \nquarterly progress reports in a format to be agreed upon with, and submitted to, ADB and the \nproject steering committee. Progress reports will be submitted to ADB and the project steering \ncommittee within 1 month of the end of the period to which they refer. The end of project report \nwill provide more detailed descriptions. \n18.  The  project  will  require  approximately  22  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices. Individual consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).
