The proposed loan to Bangladesh for the Microenterprise Development Project will finance \nmicroenterprises through the Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), an apex development \nfinance and capacity building organization, and PKSF\u2019s partner organizations (POs), which are \nselected microfinance institutions (MFIs). The project will fill the financing gap of microenterprises \nfor  rural  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  project\u2019s  impact  is  growth  of \nmicroenterprises  expanded  to  provide  forward  linkages  to  agriculture  and  generate  job \nopportunities.1 The outcome is microenterprises\u2019 access to MFI financing increased. The project\u2019s \noutputs  are  (i)  funding  to  MFIs  for  microenterprise  loans  expanded,  (ii) MFI  capacity  in \nmicroenterprise lending enhanced, and (iii) MFIs\u2019 microenterprise development support extended. \nThe project is expected to have tangible benefits for women by providing access to finance and \nenterprise development support. The cost of the proposed project is $50 million financed from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) ordinary capital resources (regular loan).  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  Microenterprises in Bangladesh are smaller than small and medium-sized enterprises, and \nthe size of their investments is too large for traditional microcredit but too small for bank financing. \nAs  Bangladesh\u2019s  economy  grows,  demand  for  microenterprise  loans  is  increasing  rapidly. \nHowever, a study by Business Finance for the Poor in Bangladesh (BFP-B), based on a survey \nof 600 microenterprises, identified inadequate access to finance as the major constraint in \ndeveloping microenterprises in Bangladesh.2 The same study estimates the microenterprise loan \ndemand\u2013supply gap to be Tk437 billion in 2015. \n \n3.  While MFIs can be a major microenterprise finance source, MFIs\u2019 microenterprise loans \nare not keeping pace with demand because of (i) MFIs\u2019 limited sources of funding, (ii) the limited \nenabling environment for MFIs\u2019 microenterprise operations, and (iii) MFIs\u2019 insufficient knowledge \nof and capacity in microenterprise lending. \n \n4.  The Government of Bangladesh established the PKSF in 1990 with the objective of \npoverty alleviation and sustainable job generation. The PKSF provides loans to its 277 POs, which \nhad total loans outstanding of Tk44 billion in 2017. The PKSF has been an important source of \nfinancing for MFIs. \n \n5.  To promote nonfarm sector-led rural economic development and poverty reduction, the \nattached transaction technical assistance (TA) project will assist the PKSF and its POs to enhance \ncapacity in microenterprise finance, promote efficient and sustainable operations, and enhance \nmicroenterprise development support. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1. \n \n                                                \n1  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning. 2013.
