INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  discussions  for  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2016\u20132018, 1  the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to prepare the country\u2019s national biomass heat \nsupply development strategy.2 In March 2016, ADB and the government through the National \nEnergy  Administration  reached  an  understanding  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, costs and financing arrangements, and terms of reference for \nconsulting  services for the TA. The TA  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy  in  promoting \nrenewable energy development and regional integration in the energy sector.3 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n   \n2.  The poverty alleviation and economic growth of the PRC were built on carbon-intensive \ngrowth and have resulted in severe air pollution affecting the lives of the country\u2019s 1.37 billion \nresidents.4 Air pollution is further amplified during winter, when the almost exclusive use of coal \nfor heating significantly increases the concentration of air pollutants, especially in the PRC\u2019s \ncolder provinces. In contrast to a continuous trend of decreasing air pollution levels in the PRC, \nsome studies and air quality data monitoring have shown that in certain centers of the northern \nPRC, the concentration of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter during winter \nactually increased during 2013\u20132015.  \n \n3.  Providing heating to the population residing in the northern part of the PRC has posed a \nchallenge  to  low-carbon  development.  The  municipal  governments  of  major  cities  have \naddressed this challenge by banning the use of coal for heating to mitigate poor air quality and \nencourage the use of low-carbon and renewable energy sources. However, the existence of \nmany institutional and financial barriers makes it difficult for clean and renewable heat sources \nto compete with cheap and abundant coal. The Government of the PRC therefore aims to \ncreate an enabling policy and market environment for renewable energy sources. One of the \nmost promising and widely available renewable resources is biomass.5 Other renewable energy \nsources such as photovoltaic, water, and wind have been gradually adopted in the PRC\u2019s \nenergy  system,  whereas  biomass  remains  underexploited  despite  its  potential  to  replace \nsignificant amounts of coal-based heating. \n \n4.  The PRC\u2019s biomass-to-energy potential is 460 million tons of standard coal equivalent \n(tsce), which includes 200 million tsce of agricultural waste, 200 million tsce of forestry waste, \n28 million tsce of animal waste, and 32 million tsce of municipality solid waste.6 Currently, only \n325 million tsce of biomass is used, accounting for 7.6% of total available biomass in the PRC. \nAs for heat supply, the potential from biomass is projected to be 33 million tsce by 2020 and 68 \nmillion tsce by 2030 (footnote 7). \n \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u2013\n2018. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 March 2016.  \n3   ADB. 2009. Energy Policy.

China Energy Outlook 2030. Beijing. \n ", "2   \n5.  In the European Union, the technological leader in biomass energy, almost half of 2014 \nrenewable energy consumption came from biomass. France, Germany, and Sweden are the \nleaders in biomass-to-heat systems.7 With turnover of close to \u20ac42 billion (estimated at $58 \nbillion8) in 2013 and employment of 380,200 people, primarily in rural areas, the European \nbiomass and biogas sectors provide a good example for successful commercialization.9 Yet \nbiomass in the PRC is mostly used by small households and/or communities and lacks a \nsupportive institutional framework that could boost its commercialization to its full potential. \nWeak enforcement of environmental standards, including restrictions on crop residue burning by \nfarmers  that  causes  extreme  air  pollution  each  year  after  harvesting  season,  is  reducing \nopportunities to turn biomass, particularly agricultural waste, into renewable energy. To exploit \nexisting opportunities, the PRC needs to improve its regulatory system, develop clear industry \nstandards, tap into foreign expertise on biomass, and close technological gaps, specifically on \nbiomass combined heat and power, biomass pellet boiler, biogas digestion and purification, and \nbiomass gasification. \n  \n6.  The National Energy Administration plans to support commercialization of biomass by \nsimultaneously  designing  an  adequate  policy  framework  and  taking  measures  to  support \nbiomass technology advancement. This aligns with the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for National \nEconomic  and  Social  Development  in  the  PRC,  which  indicates  that  the  accelerated \ndevelopment  of  biomass  would  support  the  country\u2019s  low-carbon  and  circular  economy \ntargets.10 \n \n7.  The  proposed  TA  will  support  the  development  of  a  national  biomass  heat  supply \ndevelopment strategy. In 2006, ADB supported the PRC\u2019s efforts towards preparing a national \nstrategy for rural biomass renewable energy development with a TA project,11 which focused on \nwood and agricultural residue usage for cooking and heating, as published in ADB\u2019s Rural \nBiomass Energy 2020 report.12 The major lessons of the TA project were (i) the importance of \ndeveloping a biomass strategy in a timely manner that matches with country priorities and (ii) \nhaving  strong  ownership  from  the  government.  ADB  has  also  financed  projects  based  on \ncommercial-scale  biogas  demonstration.  This  TA  will  build  on  previous  work  to  improve \ninstitutional frameworks and policies not only for biogas but also for other proven technologies \nutilizing biomass. By supporting the PRC to create a favorable institutional and regulatory \nenvironment, this TA will also help the wider use of biomass for heating. \n \n8.  The proposed TA aims to assist in developing a clear strategy, policy framework, and \nspecific measures to advance the commercialization of untapped biomass-based heat sources \nin the PRC. It will (i) conduct an in-depth assessment of the current biomass-to-heat market in \nthe  PRC;  (ii)  produce  a  sourcebook  on  biomass-to-heat  commercialization  to  disseminate \nknowledge on worldwide biomass-to-heat technology advancement; (iii) carry out workshops, \nconferences, and technical trainings on  biomass-to-heat development; and (iv) prepare a policy \nnote that formulates the national strategy to advance biomass-to-heat commercialization in the \nPRC.  \n                                                \n7  EurObserv\u2019ER. 2015.

The impact of the TA will be an expanded biomass supply in the PRC\u2019s heating systems. \nThe outcome of the TA will be commercialized biomass-based heat sources in the PRC.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The outputs of the TA will consist of the following: (i) a study on the current biomass-to-\nheat  market  in  the  PRC  is  prepared;  (ii)  a  sourcebook  on  advanced  biomass-to-heat \ntechnologies, institutions, and international best practices on biomass-to-heat commercialization \nis produced; (iii) capacity strengthening on biomass-to-heat commercialization is implemented; \nand (iv) a policy note on the PRC\u2019s strategy to advance biomass-to-heat commercialization is \ndeveloped. \n \n11.  Output 1: A study on the current biomass-to-heat market in the People's Republic \nof China prepared. An in-depth understanding on the current biomass-to-heat market in the \nPRC is essential and integral to achieving the TA objectives. Through literature review, field \nvisits, interviews, primary and secondary data collection, and case study research methods, the \nstudy will identify challenges and opportunities that the entire biomass-to-heat system faces in \nthe pursuit of commercialization. At present, three commercial-scale biomass-to-heat projects \nhave been identified: (i) the biogas project by the Inner Mongolia Yuan Yi Company in Chifeng \nCity in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, (ii) the biomass-based combined heat and power \ngeneration project by the National Energy Biopower Generation Company in Nangong City in \nHebei Province, and (iii) the biomass briquette-to-heat project by the Guangzhou Devotion \nEnergy Company in Zhuhai City in Guangdong Province. Selected commercial-scale biomass-\nto-heat  project  cases  will  assess  biomass generation  cycles,  biomass  collection  efficiency, \nstability and durability of specific technology in use, financial analysis, market acceptability, \ninstitutional  arrangements  throughout  the  entire  value  chain,  environmental  performance, \nclimate change contribution, and economic implications for society. Based on lessons learned \nfrom case studies, a comprehensive and analytical study will draw on the current status of the \nbiomass-to-heat market and technologies in the PRC, and identify challenges and opportunities \nfor the PRC biomass-to-heat market focusing on the following aspects: technical knowledge and \ncapacities, market competitiveness, legal and policy frameworks, institutions and governance, \nenvironmental improvement, and greenhouse gas emissions.    \n \n12.  Output 2: A sourcebook on advanced biomass-to-heat technologies, institutions,   \nand international best practices on biomass-to-heat commercialization produced. To help \ndisseminate knowledge on biomass-to-heat technology advancement and valuable lessons from \ninternational  experiences  on  biomass-to-heat markets  and  systems,  the TA  will  produce a \nsourcebook on biomass-to-heat commercialization. The sourcebook will compile (i) detailed \ninformation of various biomass-to-heat advanced technologies that are available in international \nmarkets;  (ii)  international  best  practices  of  commercialized  biomass-to-heat  projects  and \npractices; and (iii) information on standards, subsidy schemes, and other policy and institutional \nmeasures that other countries provide to advance biomass-to-heat commercialization. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Capacity  strengthening  on  biomass-to-heat  commercialization \nimplemented. Through international workshops, conferences, and technical trainings, the TA \nwill  provide  opportunities  for  key  stakeholders  to  gain  hands-on  learning  experience  from \ninternational  and  domestic  technical  and  policy  experts  on  biomass-to-heat  chains.  Key \n ", "4   \nstakeholders include the Ministry of Agriculture, utility bureaus, municipal and county health and \nsanitation  departments,  farmers,  waste  treatment  operators,  heating  companies,  and  gas \ncompanies.  \n \n14.  Output 4: A policy note on the People's Republic of China's strategy to advance \nbiomass-to-heat commercialization developed. Based on outputs 1\u20133, the TA will prepare a \npolicy note that formulates the national strategy to advance biomass-to-heat commercialization \nin the PRC. This policy note will discuss broad policy objectives, realistic mid- and long-term \ntargets of biomass\u2019s share in the heating sector, and quantified greenhouse gas emissions \nreduction associated with these targets. It will also detail the proposals of technical standards \nfor various forms of biomass-based heat sources in commercialization, adequate policy subsidy \nschemes,  biomass  collection  policies,  environmental  standards  for  various  biomass-to-heat \ngeneration  technologies  and  equipment,  institutional  capacity  building,  and  research  and \ndevelopment and technology transfer support to advance biomass-to-heat technologies in the \nPRC. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office \nsupplies, data and information relevant to biomass-to-heat, and other in-kind contributions. The \nproceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).
