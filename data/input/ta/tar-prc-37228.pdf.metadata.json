", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, thought to have \nemanated from Guangdong Province of the People\u2019s Republic of  China (PRC) in  late 2002, \naccelerated and spread to other areas of  the PRC  and then beyond,  due  to  SARS' high \ninfectivity  and  the  lack  of  knowledge  about  its  epidemiology.  Other  factors  included  high \npopulation density in initially affected areas, the mobility of large portions of PRC's population, \nand notably the inadequacy of surveillance and response mechanisms in the face of a dramatic \nnew threat to public health. According to Ministry of Health (MOH) statistics, by 13 May 2003, 25 \nprovinces and province-level autonomous regions (henceforth provinces) had confirmed cases \nof SARS, with 262 deaths reported nationwide.  Of the cumulative total of 5,086 PRC cases \n(comprising two-thirds of the global total), nearly one fifth were reported among health staff.  \n \n2.  Working with the World Health Organization (WHO) since February 2003, the PRC has \nacknowledged the need for greater transparency and responsiveness.  The Government has \nadopted more focused action to address the SARS crisis\u2014mobilizing domestic resources and \nseeking international assistance\u2014and has pledged to rebuild surveillance mechanisms and the \npreventive health system in the medium term.1  The Government is also taking steps to address \nthe threat of a spiraling epidemic in the poorer Western Region, which is least equipped to \nrespond to SARS, particularly in rural areas and among the poor and other vulnerable groups.2  \nOn 23 April 2003, the Government submitted a request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor emergency technical assistance (TA) to combat SARS in at-risk Western Region provinces.3 \nCommunications between ADB, MOH, and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), including a tripartite \nvideoconference, confirmed agreement on the overall objectives, general content, and principles \nguiding  the  TA,  including  the  need  for  (i)  urgent  processing;4 (ii)  flexibility  in  design  and \nimplementation;  (iii)  close  collaboration  with  WHO  and  other  organizations,  including \nnongoverment  organizations  (NGOs),  mobilizing  to  fight  SARS;  and  (iv)  alignment  with \nemerging frameworks for coordinated efforts between the Government and funding agencies.  \nAppendix 1 gives a project framework for the TA for combating SARS in the Western Region. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Overall progress in national health indicators masks the need for concerted Government \nefforts in the public health sector; supportive reforms and engagement of external funding \nagencies are also critical.  Increased investment and emphasis on equity in allocation are \nneeded to rebuild the public health system, particularly to augment (i) the rural health system, (ii) \nsurveillance and preventive services, and (iii) provision of access to quality primary health care \namong  the  poor.    Underinvestment\u2014especially in primary health care and prevention and \ncontrol of communicable diseases5\u2014and a shift in responsibilities for funding basic social \nservices to provincial and subprovincial levels have had marked effects in the poorer Western \nRegion.  A simultaneous shift of the cost burdens of health care to households has increasingly \nstrained access to preventive and other basic health services among the rural poor and migrant \n                                                 \n1  This is reflected in MOH and interministry directives and public announcements.  Two funds (totaling nearly $600 \nmillion equivalent) being mobilized by the Ministry of Finance and the State Council focus on ensuring free SARS \ntreatment for rural residents and the urban poor, and bolstering disease control agencies in interior provinces.    \n2  International experience from past epidemics indicates that remote and insular communities may be at heightened \nrisk due to relative immunological isolation.  \n3  Listing in ADB Business Opportunities has been waived due to the emergency nature of the assistance provided.  \n4  The TA is consistent with recommendations of the ADB SARS Response Task Force, which endorsed emergency \nsupport to the PRC.  Mitigating SARS' socioeconomic impacts also promotes ADB priorities for PRC and the region.    \n5   The dismantling of commune-based rural health care at the onset of economic reforms in the late 1970s led to a \ncollapse of previously extensive disease surveillance, mass immunization, and health education mechanisms. ", "2 \nworkers, who are  not covered by urban social insurance mechanisms.6  Fee imposition  has \nnotably suppressed demand for preventive services (e.g., immunizations), while a bias toward \ncurative treatment (reflecting both public investment and implicit incentives facing providers) led \nto declines in fiscal and human resources devoted to disease surveillance.     \n \n4.  Marked weaknesses in the public health system in the Western Region, on top of overall \nlower levels of development, underscore the need for rapid action to prevent a full-blown SARS \nepidemic.  This is recognized by the Government,7 which has already established the Leading \nGroup on SARS (chaired by the  Vice-Premier, concurrently the  Minister of Health), and  the \ninternational community. Several bilateral and multilateral agencies are responding to requests \nfor assistance, with the United Nations Development Programme (backed by WHO technical \nexpertise) now acting as focal point.8 At the same time, a consensus is emerging on the need to \ncoordinate immediate efforts aimed at containing SARS and to ensure that these feed in to (i) \nstrengthening more general epidemic surveillance and emergency response capacities in the \nnear term, as a national and global public good; and (ii) more systematic, sustained action to \naddress underlying factors, such as gaps in the public health system and governance issues.     \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n5.    The TA's goal is to effectively contain SARS in the Western Region, preventing cross-\nborder  transmission  and  developing  capacity for rapid epidemic  detection  and  response. \nToward this goal, the TA seeks to help contain the outbreak of SARS in the target provinces by \nstrengthening local capacities for SARS prevention, surveillance, management, and mitigation, \nwith a particular emphasis on quick action to protect front-line medical workers, the poor, and \nother at-risk groups. This will be accomplished within a framework of close collaboration with \nother domestic and international partners. Lessons collected will be shared widely, to contribute \nto dialogue on measures to address public health system challenges, and present new models. \n \n6.  The TA will build capacities of provincial and local governments and health units to plan \nand implement comprehensive programs to combat SARS, and will provide urgently needed \nequipment and supplies, focusing on identification and prevention efforts. In addition to training \nfor front-line health staff (vital to containing SARS), information, education, and communication \n(IEC) campaigns will raise public awareness of SARS and key prevention measures. Support \nwill be linked to efforts combining relevant  ministries, NGOs, community groups, the private \nsector, and international organizations,  and will be provided through services and related \nfacilities required to implement the TA and achieve capacity building objectives.  The equipment \nand supplies to be funded are (i) part of an integrated package for capacity strengthening; (ii) \nrequired for implementing the expertise transferred via consulting services and training for (a) \nepidemic surveillance systems and analysis; (b) screening, protection, and quarantining; and (c) \nIEC; and (iii) protection for health staff involved in SARS diagnosis and treatment.   \n \n7.  The Government has identified Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Yunnan9 provinces for \ndirect assistance under the TA, based on population characteristics including poverty and \n                                                 \n6  The Second National Health Services Survey of 1998 revealed substantial declines in population coverage under \nsocial insurance schemes, while ADB research notes a that \"health services in the PRC have a strong and \nincreasing urban bias.\" (ADB. 2002. The 2020 Project: Policy Support in the People's Republic of China. Manila)    \n7   The draft National SARS Control Strategy highlights the Western Region, the rural poor, and migrant workers. \n8   A forum on 2 May 2003 confirmed the need for timely and flexible action by ADB, and designated the World Bank \nas the focal point for medium-long term action. Appendix 2 outlines external agency responses as of 15 May 2003.   \n9  These provinces have a total  population of roughly 72 million people.   ", "    3 \ninclusion of minority groups, local health resources, patterns in current and expected SARS \nprevalence, and coverage under other international assistance. Xinjiang and Yunnan are doubly \ncritical as economic and transport corridors linking the PRC to Central Asia and Mekong regions. \nVisibly effective SARS control programs are critical to keeping borders open and secure from \nSARS transmission.     \n \n8.    The  TA  is  guided  by  the  principles  of  timeliness  and  effectiveness  in  response.  \nFlexibility is incorporated in the design and implementation arrangements in light of substantial \nuncertainties in the way the SARS epidemic will unfold in the Western Region.  The TA  will \nprovide  4  broad  outputs:  (i)  sound  provincial  plans  to  address  SARS;  (ii)  strengthened \nepidemiological surveillance systems; (iii) augmented emergency response capabilities; and (iv) \nincreased public awareness of SARS and self-protection measures through effective, multi-\nmode information and health education delivery mechanisms. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Assessment  and  Planning.  In  light  of  the  difficulty  of  diagnosing  SARS  and  the \nresource constraints plaguing local health systems in the Western Region, current statistics may \nunderreport  the  seriousness  of  the  SARS  epidemic  in  these  provinces.  Moreover,  SARS \ntransmission dynamics are not well understood, particularly for cases now emerging in rural \nareas.  Dialogue  with  WHO  and  other  relevant  organizations,  augmented  by  focused  field \nevaluations if needed, will be important to assess current conditions and likely rural transmission \ndynamics. The TA will assist target provincial governments to assess (i) the overall readiness of \nprovincial and subprovincial health systems to respond to SARS, identifying key shortfalls; (ii) \nresource availability, including human resources, equipment (e.g., for diagnosis, transport, and \nwaste  management),  and  basic  supplies;  and  (iii)  provincial  capacity  to  implement  a \ncomprehensive plan, ranging from surveillance to  IEC. These will support  establishment of \nsound plans for combating SARS in each province that (i) build on strategy elements already in \nplace; (ii) are formulated in alignment with both local context and frameworks developed by the \nLeading Group on SARS, WHO, and other relevant bodies; and (iii) support periodic monitoring \nto facilitate adjustments in response to changes in the SARS situation, and to capture lessons \nthat may be used to strengthen epidemic response in other provinces.   \n \n10.  Epidemiological Surveillance.  The TA will work with provincial health bureaus and  \ndisease control agencies, with technical support  from MOH, WHO, and other national and \ninternational agencies, to enhance epidemiological surveillance systems in the target provinces. \nBased on assessed capacities and constraints  (e.g., in  system coverage and data quality, \nequipment,  training,  and  operational  budgets),  the  TA  will  help  (i)  develop  a  system \nimprovement framework for affecting needed changes, (ii) identify and procure urgently needed \nequipment; (iii) develop and provide targeted training, focusing on disease control staff at \nprovincial, prefecture, and county levels, as well as on-site and sentinel staff responsible for \nepidemiological reporting. While addressing the immediate threat of SARS, the framework will \nprovide the basis for a comprehensive surveillance system to address future threats. \n \n11.  Emergency Response Systems.  In parallel with the development of provincial plans \nfor addressing SARS, the TA will assist in compiling  effective, comprehensive  emergency \nresponse plans covering (i) coordination in key areas requiring intragovernment reaction (e.g., \nborders as a key control point for epidemics); (ii) mechanisms for immediate detection and alert, \nand coordination between emergency response staff, local clinics, and hospitals; (iii) emergency \nmedical care and triage, including medical transport and quarantine procedures; (iv) hospital-\nbased medical care and patient management (isolation, disinfection, diagnosis, treatment, and ", "4 \nreporting), (v) exposure management, including protection for health personnel at all levels; (vi) \ninfection control precautions  for  households,  the  workplace,  and  hospitals;  (vii)  safety in \nspecimen collection, handling,  and  final processing; and  (viii) overall system  management, \ncoordination, and supervision capacity. \n \n12.  The TA will draw on local human resources, WHO, other international organizations, \nlocal and international NGOs, local medical universities, and training institutions to develop and \nprovide training courses to meet requirements of the emergency response system, particularly \nfor front-line health staff.  Capacity building will prioritize managers and staff at hospitals and \nother institutions designated for SARS treatment and response. Early training efforts will also \ncover other key groups, including local government officials responsible for plan implementation. \nModes of classroom and on-the-job training will be chosen to flexibly meet needs, with tailored \nmaterials and mechanisms (e.g., to disseminate key safe practices to workers charged with \ndisinfection of public places). Based on needs assessment and dialogue with other national and \ninternational agencies, the TA will also provide needed equipment and  personnel protection \nsupplies. 10 Impact analysis will also help to ensure new methods are put into practice.    \n \n13.  Information, Education, and Communication. The TA will assist target provinces in \nformulating and implementing IEC strategies to effectively disseminate key information such as \n(i) SARS symptoms, characteristics, and  risk factors; (ii) SARS prevention for individuals, \nhouseholds, and institutions (e.g., schools and workplaces); (iii) existing control mechanisms \nand available health services; (iv) public rights to cost-free treatment;11 (v) social responsibility; \nand (vi) advice for people who may have been exposed (including by family members). These \nwill be linked to national-level initiatives, but will also build on local efforts, in order to address \nprovince-specific needs. Multiple delivery modes for IEC will include local newspapers and other \nprinted material, television, and radio, and will seek to mobilize existing social institutions (e.g., \nvillage committees, schools, etc.). Action plans will include targeted efforts for reaching high-risk \ngroups  and  the  hard-to-reach  (e.g.,  ethnic  minorities).  The  TA  will  assist  in  materials \ndevelopment, training, social mobilization, provision of key equipment, and IEC implementation.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $3.0 million equivalent. ADB will contribute $2.0 \nmillion, financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s  TA funding program, and the Government will \ncontribute roughly $1.0 million equivalent (Appendix 3).  As part of an integrated support \npackage, ADB will finance an estimated $600,000 in urgently required equipment and supplies.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.    The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Foreign  Loan  Office  of  MOH.  Joint  MOH-MOF \nguidance will ensure consistency and complementarity between the TA and other domestic and \nforeign-assisted initiatives. A central project implementation unit (PIU) will compile a profile of \nSARS burdens and readiness in the four western provinces, and will propose to ADB (i) an \nemergency package of urgently needed equipment and materials, based on recommendations \nfrom WHO12 and  the  State  Development  and  Reform  Commission;  and  (ii)  allocation  of \nresources and materials across provinces. Provincial PIUs will report to the central PIU and be \nset up within health bureaus of the selected provinces to (i) oversee day-to-day implementation; \n                                                 \n10  This may include protective clothing and related supplies and diagnosis and treatment equipment for designated \nhospitals, such as portable mobile x-ray machines (for safe deployment in SARS wards) and respirators.    \n11  These rights are laid down in a MOF-MOH joint declaration, issued on 30 April 2003.  \n12  WHO has drafted a list of emergency responses for SARS in the PRC.   ", "    5 \n(ii) ensure coordination with provincial-level bureaus, offices, and other relevant organizations \naffected by or addressing SARS locally; and (iii) facilitate sharing of information and lessons \nlearned within and among the provinces.   \n \n16.  Given key uncertainties in the evolution of SARS in the Western Region and in national \nand external resource mobilization, implementation must be flexible, with timely inputs tailored \nto periodically assessed needs. Expertise, equipment, and supplies will be provided within the \nframework of Government and external responses, balancing (i) efficiency; (ii) responsiveness \nto province-specific needs; (iii) strategic consistency (e.g., between provincial and national \naction plans); and (iv) interpartner information sharing, capacity for quick concerted action, and \noptimal use of very limited human resources deployable to SARS responses in the PRC.   \n \n17.  TA implementation arrangements will provide flexibility to allow adjustment in the terms \nof reference (TOR) of consultants, duration, and schedule of expert inputs. In dialogue with \nMOH, ADB will recruit one domestic consultant as TA coordinator for all target provinces, with \nauxiliary international and/or domestic consultants  selected to meet  identified needs and in-\nprovince capacities.13  Consultants will be engaged as individuals, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. In dialogue with MOH, ADB may consider direct selection \nof qualified  domestic and/or international organizations, local  institutions, and/or short-term \nresource persons, where justified by efficacy, efficiency, and/or urgency in completing activities \nsuch as training and development and dissemination of targeted IEC materials.   \n \n18.  Flexible procurement arrangements are needed to allow timely response to urgent and \nevolving needs.  Unless otherwise agreed by ADB, the central PIU will conduct all procurement \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement.  To expedite delivery, direct purchase \nmay be used to procure the agreed emergency package. The TA coordinator will assist the \ncentral PIU in compiling subsequent proposals for equipment and consumable supplies integral \nto the TA's comprehensive support program.  Procurement between $100,000 and $500,000 will \nuse  international  shopping  with  an  abbreviated  bidding  period;  procurement  valued  below \n$100,000  will  employ  direct  purchase.    Indicative  procurement  categories  are  shown  in \nAppendix 4.  To ensure timely provision of goods and services, an advance payment facility will \nbe established for each province (under distinct bank accounts), in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grants, and subject to terms laid out in the \nletter establishing the facility.      \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented from May 2003 to May 2004. In light of the unpredictable \nevolution of the SARS epidemic,  frequent reviews (including a midterm review) will carefully \nassess implementation arrangements and approaches, with appropriate adjustments instituted. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis to the Government of the People's \nRepublic of China for Combating Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in the Western Region.  \n \n                                                 \n13  Indicative TOR for expert inputs appear in Appendix 4.  Specific qualifications, TOR, and criteria for assessing \nauxiliary consultant services (estimated to total $250,000 equivalent) will be determined in concert with WHO.

ADB's \nresident mission in the PRC will be proactive in coordinating external funding agencies, and will facilitate linkages of the TA to short-term \nand longer term initiatives, and with World Health Organization (WHO) technical expertise in the People's Republic of China (PRC).    \nWorld Bank  Currently discussing an emergency program based in part on elements that are covered under two on-going health projects that deal with \ninfectious diseases. The World Bank has stressed to MOH and MOF that, rather than dealing with funding agencies individually, they \nshould define a broader program, possibly in phases, under which all agencies wanting to assist could select elements, ensuring \nconsistency. The World Bank will serve as focal point of a coordinated response to longer term issues, and is now working with MOH and \nWHO on a broad program outline. To meet immediate needs, the World Bank plans to reallocate $5million to $15 million from its two \nongoing health projects, which have implementing units in place and work in several SARS-affected provinces. The World Bank will also \nassist Beijing and Guangdong, and hopes to complete reallocation in 1-2 weeks. The World Bank will also restructure several other \nprojects to release more funding ($5 million to 15 million) which may take about 3-4 weeks, and could include other affected provinces. \nFinally, the World Bank is at a preliminary stage in assessing the need and timing for a new operation or supplemental loan.  \nUnited Nations  Received requests from Beijing Municipality for technical support to handle communications and for the Leading Group on SARS, which \nDevelopment  may ask for assistance to evaluate needs in rural areas and particular provinces.

Terms of Reference \n \n1.  The central Government has already begun to mobilize resources to respond to the \nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), including establishing the Leading Group on SARS, \namassing funding (including some targeted toward the poor and interior regions), and dialogue \nwith multiple national and international agencies toward developing an overarching framework. \nWithin the Western Region, individual provinces are, to varying degrees, mobilizing responses, \nand in some cases, elements of action plans are in place. However, there has not been \nwidespread coordination of  provincial  efforts  with  national  authorities,  across  neighboring \nprovinces, or across agencies within provinces.   \n \n2.  In  coordination  with  relevant  Government  and  international  agencies  (to  ensure \nconsistency with and contribution to national-level strategies), the technical assistance (TA) will \nprovide expert advice, working with provincial authorities in health and other key sectors to \nestablish or augment comprehensive and concrete provincial plans (including estimated costs \nand  clear  delineation  of  responsibilities  for  implementation  and  budgeting,  coordination \nmechanisms, etc.). Rapid assessment of needs and capacities at the start of the TA (followed \nby periodic review and targeted investigation throughout period covered) will be critical to (i) \ninform  provincial  action  plans;  (ii)  guide  formulation  and  implementation  of  surveillance, \nemergency  response,  and  information,  communication,  and  education  (IEC)  campaigns \ncomponents under the TA; and (iii) ensure feed-in to medium-term efforts to strengthen general \ncapacities in these areas within local health and related sectors.  \n \n3.  TA Coordinator (domestic consultant; 12 person-months, including an estimated 120 \ndays in-field during multiple visits to the Western Region).  Reporting to the central project \nimplementation unit and working closely with the project implementation units (PIUs) in the \nselected provinces, the coordinator will facilitate implementation of the TA in target provinces, \nensuring full communication and dovetailing of efforts across all administrative levels, and with \nother active national and international agencies.  Other specific tasks include the following: \n(i)  Liaise with relevant focal points for other domestic and internationally funded \nSARS initiatives. \n(ii)  In close dialogue with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and consultation with \nthe  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  assist  the  central  PIU  in  assessing \nneeded  equipment  and  supplies  that  are  integrally  linked  to  the  TA's \ncomprehensive program (complementing capacity building, personnel protection, \nand  IEC  efforts).  This  will  include  identification  of  (a)  provincial  capacity  to \ndetermine  local  needs;  (b)  sources,  costs,  and  means  of  procurement;  (c) \ndistribution to and within target provinces, and related logistics; and (d) training \nand other needed investments needed to ensure apt usage. Follow up to ensure \ntimely delivery, deployment, and appropriate use. \n(iii)  Assist PIUs in each target province to formulate a comprehensive and concrete \naction plan, including cost estimates, implementation and coordination across \nagencies and administrative levels, and budget planning.  Consider existing local \nmodels (e.g., community-based approaches employed in Beijing) and lessons \nlearned, as relevant to Western Region contexts.    \n(iv)  Provide guidance and assistance to all PIUs related to plan achievement, and \nfacilitate communication and information sharing. \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \n(v)  Provide  concise  updates  every  two  weeks,  and  quarterly  reports  to  ADB. \nUpdates should report progress and identify challenges and propose resolutions. \n \n4.  The coordinator will also identify to the central PIU and to ADB specific expertise inputs \nneeded, as well as appropriate mechanisms for carrying out key activities under the TA. These \nrecommendations will be formulated in close consultation with WHO1 (particularly with regard to \nspecific qualifications and terms of reference and other international and domestic organizations \nas appropriate. Similarly, ADB will seek external validation of consultant inputs via dialogue with \nWHO and other partners, for quality control and consistency with broader initiatives.   \n \n5.  The coordinator will be the team leader and take overall responsibility for any auxiliary \nconsultants or individual resource persons mobilized, and will monitor and liaise with domestic \nand/or international organizations and local  institutions selected to carry out activities.
