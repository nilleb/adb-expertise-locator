The  IEE  contains  separate \nassessments of each of the eight subprojects. The results are in \nSupplementary Appendix  I.  A  summary  IEE  has  also  been \nprepared. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will work with both the national and the provincial \ngovernments.  At  the  national  level,  the  Project  will  help  the \nGovernment  strengthen  sector  planning  and  management  by \ndeveloping  a  sector  strategy,  a  road  map,  and  an  investment \nprogram. A public\u2013private partnership (PPP) framework will also \nbe  prepared  together  with  the  sector  strategy  to  enable  the \nGovernment to promote private sector involvement in the sector \nmore effectively. At the provincial level, the Project will provide \nsafe,  reliable,  and  sustainable  water  supply  and  improved \nsanitation services in seven districts and one city in Surkhandarya \nProvince.  The  services  can  be  used  as  a  model  that  can  be \nreplicated and expanded in other provinces. Besides investments \nin physical infrastructure for system rehabilitation and necessary \nupgrading,  the  Project  will  address  the  critical  planning, \nmanagement, financial, operational, and customer relations needs \nof  the  vodokanals  (water  supply  and  sanitation  agencies)  to \nimprove service delivery efficiency.  \n   \nRationale  The water supply and sanitation (WSS) systems in Uzbekistan, \nwhich were inherited from the Soviet Union, have reached the end \nof their economic life and require extensive rehabilitation. The \nprovision of reliable, safe, and affordable WSS services to the \npopulation is a key challenge to the Government, as the sector is \nfaced with a series of issues, including deteriorated infrastructure, \noutdated sector strategy and planning, inappropriate standards, \nlimited financial resources, and weak institutional capacity. The \nsector performance indicators for 2006 show that, despite high \nnetwork coverage (82% of the population\u201488% urban and 79% \nrural), households are supplied with water for only 6\u201324 hours a \nday in the urban areas and 2\u201312 hours a day in the rural areas. \nSurkhandarya has network coverage of 76% (87% urban and 74% \nrural). Water supply in the province is available for 6\u201316 hours a \nday  in  the  urban  areas  and  2\u201310  hours  in  the  rural  areas. \nNonperforming  (deteriorated  and  leaking)  infrastructure,  power \noutages, and lack of revenue prevent better service. No reliable ", "ii   \nestimate on unaccounted-for water (UFW) is available because of \na  lack  of  meters;  the  general  estimate  is  more  than  50% \nnationwide.  Improving  the  health  and  living  conditions  of  the \npeople by providing them with better access to safe and reliable \nwater supply and better sanitation is therefore the Government\u2019s \ntop priority. The Project will support water supply and sanitation \nsector development in Uzbekistan by tackling four challenges: (i) \nshortfalls in policy and standards, (ii) investment needs, (iii) sector \nand business management, and (iv) operational and institutional \ngaps. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  When  it  is  completed  in  2014,  the  Project  will  improve  living \nstandards and public health for about 340,000 people living in \nSurkhandarya  Province.  The  outcome  will  be  safe,  reliable, \ninclusive, and sustainable water supply and sanitation services \nand improved community hygiene, in particular: (i) an increase in \nthe duration of water supply services to 20 hours a day by 2014 \nand 24 hours a day by 2020, (ii) a reduction in UFW to less than \n40%, (iii) full cost recovery for all project vodokanals from 2014 \nonward, and (iv) prompt recording of and response to  customer \ncomplaints.  The  Project  will  achieve  this  impact  and  these \noutcomes by (i) strengthening sector planning, management, and \nregulation capacity, (ii) rehabilitating water supply and sanitation \nsystems  and  facilities,  (iii)  addressing  social  and  gender \nimpediments  to  equality  of  access  to  services;  (iv)  enhancing \npublic awareness and practice of good hygiene, and (v) improving \nthe management and the skills and capability of vodokanals. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $40.0 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $5.7 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan   \nAmount  Share \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  30.0  75.0 \nMDTF-WFPFa  1.5  3.7 \nGovernment  8.5  21.3 \n Total  40.0  100.0 \n  a  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility. \nContributors:  the  governments  of  Australia,  Austria,  and  Norway,  and \nadministered by ADB. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. ", "  iii\nAllocation and Relending  The  Government  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank \nTerms  (ADB)  for  a  loan  in  special  drawing  rights,  equivalent  to \n$30 million from its Special Funds resources. The loan will have a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an \ninterest charge of 1% yearly during the grace period and 1.5% \nyearly thereafter. The Government will relend the proceeds of the \nloan to the Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) under \na subsidiary loan agreement. The relending will be made on ADB \nloan terms, with an additional charge of not more than 0.2% on \nthe ADB interest rate (1.2% during the grace period and 1.7% \nyearly thereafter). UCSA will onlend the subsidiary loan proceeds \nto  the  Surkhandarya  provincial  government  (SPG),  which  will \nfurther onlend the proceeds to the subproject vodokanals, on the \nsame  terms.  SPG  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risks.  The \nGovernment  has  also  requested  grant  financing  for  the \nstrengthening of sector strategy and management (component 1) \nand  capacity  development  for  service  delivery  (component  4) \nunder the Project. To finance these two components,  the Multi-\nDonor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility \nwill provide a grant of $1.5 million equivalent to be administered \nby ADB. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency   Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) \n   \nImplementation  UCSA will be the Executing Agency for the Project. UCSA has \nArrangements/Plan  extensive experience in implementing projects funded by external \nagencies.  A  project  steering  committee  under  a  deputy  prime \nminister of the cabinet of ministers will be set up to give overall \ndirection and guidance to the Project. A project management unit \n(PMU) within UCSA will implement, manage, and coordinate all \nproject  activities.  A  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  directly \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  subproject  implementation  in \nSurkhandarya Province will also be set up. \n \nTo guide project implementation, a project implementation plan \nbased  on  the  project  schedule,  implementation  arrangements, \nprocurement  packages,  and  assurances  from  the  Government \nhas been developed during project preparation. The plan specifies \nthe key project management, implementation, and auditing and \nreporting  activities  during  project  implementation  with  clear \nstarting and due dates for each activity, responsible parties, and \nlinks between project activities.  \n   \n ", "iv   \nProcurement  Goods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) and the procurement plan for the Project. The \nprocurement plan will be updated at least yearly for the next 18 \nmonths of procurement activities. International competitive bidding \nprocedures will be used for major civil works contracts costing \nmore than $2,000,000 equivalent and supply contracts worth more \nthan  $500,000  equivalent.  Civil  works  valued  at  $100,000\u2013\n$2,000,000  and  goods  valued  at  $100,000\u2013$500,000  will  be \nprocured through national competitive bidding (NCB). The NCB \nannex in the procurement plan summarizes the modifications or \nclarifications needed in the Borrower\u2019s procedures to enable the \nBorrower  to  carry  out  NCB  under  ADB-financed  projects. \nShopping procedures will be followed for works, materials, and \nequipment packages costing up to $100,000.  \n   \nConsulting Services  A  total  of  568  person-months  of  consulting  services  (51 \ninternational and 517 national) will be required to (i) develop a \nwater  supply  and  wastewater  sector  strategy  and  investment \nprogram, (ii) prepare contract packages and tender documents, \n(iii) supervise  construction  and  evaluate  project  activities, \n(iv) guide and supervise resettlement, (v) monitor the social and \ngender and environmental impact of the Project, (vi) coordinate \nthe  capacity  development  program,  (vii) implement  the  school \nsanitation  and  hygiene  program,  and  (viii)  support  the  other \nactivities of the PMU and PIU. The selection and engagement of \nconsulting services to be financed by ADB will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time) and the procurement plan. \nThe selection will be based on one of the following: (i) the quality \nand cost of the services, according to the technical proposal (full \nor  simplified);  (ii) the  consultants\u2019  qualifications,  for  small \nassignments that cost less than $200,000 per contract; or (iii) \nindividual  consultant  selection  for  very  small  consultant \nassignments that cost less than $100,000. \n   ", "  v\nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit about 340,000 residents in the project \nBeneficiaries  areas by 2014 by providing safe, reliable, and inclusive piped \nwater supply, improving sanitation, and promoting good hygiene. \nThe duration of water supply services will be increased to 20 \nhours a day by 2014 and 24 hours a day by 2020, unaccounted-\nfor water will be reduced to less than 40%, all project vodokanals \nwill achieve full cost recovery from 2014 onward, and customer \ncomplaints  will  be  recorded  and  responded  to  promptly.  The \nProject will benefit about 20% of the population of the province, \nand nearly 90% of the urban residents and over 30% of the rural \nresidents of the seven project districts and Termez City. About \n32% of the project beneficiaries are poor. While both men and \nwomen will benefit from the Project, women will benefit more from \ntime savings, less drudgery, and better family health. In addition, \nthe Project will help the Government draw up a coherent vision \nand strategy for WSS sector development. The PPP framework \nwill enable the Government to engage private participation more \nefficiently in the sector. The institutional reforms that will transform \nvodokanals  into  business-oriented  service  providers\u2014financial \nand  tariff  reforms,  customer  registration,  complaint  response \nmechanism,  and  performance  benchmarking\u2014together  with \nmanagement  tools  and  capacity  development  programs,  will \nprovide vodokanals with more internal incentives and capability to \ndeliver better WSS services. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Five possible risks have been identified and addressed in the \nproject  design.  First,  the  risk  of  lack  of  commitment  to  a \ncomprehensive  sector  strategy  and  investment  program  is \naddressed by the broadly consultative and participatory approach \nto  the  strategy  study,  to  ensure  government  ownership  of  the \nstrategy, road map, and investment program. Second, to avert \ndelays in project start-up caused by the delayed preparation and \napproval of a nationwide feasibility study, feasibility studies for all \nsubprojects have been conducted and completed in parallel with \nthe project preparation and the Government has endorsed these \nstudies before loan negotiations. Third, to forestall delays in the \nprovision  of  local  counterpart  funds,  assurances  have  been \nobtained from the Government that it will allocate and provide the \nfunds on time. Fourth, given the limited capability of vodokanals to \nmeet  the  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  the \nexpanded  water  supply  systems,  the  capacity  development \ncomponent  of  the  Project  includes  management  improvement \nactivities, tariff and financial reforms, and targeted training. Lastly, \nto  guard  against  the  adverse  effects  of  resettlement  and \naffordability  issues  on  poor  and  vulnerable  households,  the \nresettlement plans and other due-diligence arrangements ensure \nthat all affected people will improve or at least maintain their living \nstandards  after  the  Project,  and  that  connection  charges  are \nremoved and payment for meters is spread over 3 years. \n \n \n \n \n ", "vi   \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Surkhandarya Water Supply and Sanitation Project (the \nProject). \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Uzbekistan has a population of 26.6 million (2006), about 9.6 million of these, or 37%, \nliving in urban centers and 17 million, or 63%, in rural areas. Because of the wide range of \nenvironments in the country, population density varies significantly, from 59 persons per square \nkilometer  (km2)  in  the  fertile  Fergana  Valley  to  6.6  persons  per  km2  in  the  central  Navoi \nProvince. Traditionally populations were grouped around natural water sources including the \nFergana Valley and old cities like Bukhara, Samarkhand, and Kiva.  \n \n3.  Among the regions in the country, Surkhandarya, with a population of about 1.92 million, \nis the eighth most populous. Termez City (population 127,000) and Denau City (population \n68,000) are the main urban centers. A World Bank poverty study (2000) estimated that 28.4% of \nthe population of Surkhandarya Province had incomes below the poverty line.1 The province, \nlocated near the border with Afghanistan, has been a closed province for many years, but \nrecent developments promoting Silk Road tourism and the construction of a new rail link has led \nto  opportunities  for  growth.  Surkhandarya  is  one  of  the  main  cotton-growing  provinces  in \nUzbekistan, with about 200,000 hectares under irrigated cotton. Most of the rural population is \ninvolved in growing, harvesting, and ginning cotton. \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n4.  A massive irrigated agriculture expansion program was undertaken by the Soviet Union \nin Uzbekistan in the 1960s and 1970s. Irrigation was based around 1,500- to 5,000-hectare \ncollective  farms.  Communities  were  established  on  each  collective  farm  and  supplied  with \npotable water from a system sourced and developed separately from the irrigation system. \nProvincial and district centers served these communes as urban administrative and commercial \ncenters\u2014a post-independence function they still have. \n \n5.  Water is largely supplied from groundwater sources several tens of kilometers from the \nservice area, pumped to distribution centers, and distributed to towns and villages. As local \nreserves of groundwater are often saline or inadequate, they are supplemented with water \nsupplied through a series of regional and interregional trunk mains. Under the Soviet Union, the \nsystems  were  overdesigned,  based  on  limited  evaluation  of  technical  options,  used  high \nconsumption  rates  (three times  the  current  average  in  the  Organisation  for  Economic \nCo-operation and Development countries), and cost a great deal to maintain and operate. Water \nproduction facilities and customer connections were not metered, so consumption and tariffs \nwere based on normative values. Furthermore, all facilities were owned and operated by public \nenterprises supervised by government ministries and were routinely subsidized from the state \nbudget. A 20% decline in gross domestic product after independence affected the availability of \nfunding to the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector, which thus became unable to operate \nand maintain the systems. \n                                                 \n1  The poverty line is based on an average per capita per day consumption below 2,100 kilocalories. The Project \nadopts the World Bank\u2019s methodology for establishing poverty rates in the country, which is largely based on this \nfood consumption indicator. ", "2 \n \n6.  Water Supply. At independence in 1991, it was claimed that 89% of the population had \naccess  to  potable  water.  Reports  for  2006  from  vodokanals 2 (WSS  agencies)  and  the \nUzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) estimated network coverage at 82% of the \ntotal population (88% of the urban population and 79% of the rural population). Households, \nhowever, are supplied with water 6\u201324 hours a day in the urban areas and 2\u201312 hours3 a day in \nthe countryside. Surkhandarya Province has a network coverage of 76% (87% urban and 74% \nrural). Water is available 6\u201316 hours a day in the urban areas and 2\u201310 hours in the rural areas. \nNonperforming (deteriorated and leaking) infrastructure, power outages, and lack of revenue \nprevent better service. With water supply services so inadequate and unreliable, the people \nresort to collecting water from untreated open sources like canals and streams or paying for \nwater from vendors or tankers. Only 10% of houses are metered, making it difficult to assess \nactual  performance  and  consumption.  Consumption  is  therefore  assessed  on  the  basis  of \nnormative demand values.  \n \n7.  Nationwide, unaccounted-for water (UFW) from physical losses is officially estimated at \n41%, but, given the deteriorated state of the infrastructure, this figure is considered low. In \nSurkhandarya Province, combined with nonpayment of bills, UFW is possibly greater than 60%. \nThe  major  causes  of  UFW  are  system  losses  due  to  (i)  leakage  from  deteriorated  WSS \ninfrastructure  at  source,  along  the  distribution  networks,  and  at  consumer  points; \n(ii) overestimation of the amount of water produced, based on the normal capacity of the source \nrather  than  actual  production;  (iii)  illegal  connections;  and  (iv)  water  wastage  due  to  the \nirregularity of water supply and the lack of meters. \n \n8.  Sanitation.  Uzbekistan  has  265  cities  and  urban  settlements.  Of  these,  69  have \nwastewater treatment systems. The Government estimates sewerage system coverage at 51% \nof the population. However, most of the systems are not functioning properly. Rural and urban \npopulations not served by a centralized system use pit latrines near their homes. Termez, the \ncapital city of Surkhandarya Province, has a municipal wastewater treatment plant, which is now \nbeing rehabilitated and upgraded.4  \n \n9.  Government Policy. Uzbekistan\u2019s WSS policy and regulatory framework derives legal \nforce from (i) the national 10-year water supply development plan approved by the cabinet of \nministers in 1999 (Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers (RCM) No. 278),5 (ii) a resolution of the \ncabinet of ministers approved in 2003 (RCM No. 405),6 and (iii) the water supply investment \nprogram for 2009\u20132012.7 The key objectives of the WSS policy are to (i) improve water sector \nservices through a national water supply development plan; (ii) attain financial sustainability \nthrough  an  effective  tariff  system  and  cost  recovery;  (iii)  plan  adequate  investments  with \ndomestic  and  external  funding;  (iv)  achieve  further  decentralization  of  WSS  services;  (v) \nencourage  private  sector  participation  and  public-private  partnerships  in  the  sector;  (vi) \nimplement  hygiene  and  sanitation  education  programs  in  schools;  (vii)  achieve  improved \n                                                 \n2  The vodokanals are either state-owned enterprises or limited-liability companies that provide water supply and \nsanitation services in their respective towns and districts. \n3  Households farthest from the water supply source may not be receiving services every day, and some households, \ne.g., communities in Muzarabad district, are not being served at all. \n4 The rehabilitation is being undertaken by the Government with its own funds. When completed by mid-August 2008, \nit is expected to increase capacity to 12,500 cubic meters (m3) (from the original 10,000 m3), exceeding the present \npeak demand of 11,000 cubic meters, reached on a few occasions during the winter. \n5  Cabinet of Ministers, 1 June 1999: RCM No. 278\u2013Steps for Further Improvement in Providing Rural Settlements \nwith Drinking Water and Natural Gas. Also, Minutes of 3 April and 14 May: Preparation of a Scheme for Water \nSupply Development to 2010. \n6  Cabinet of Ministers, 17 September 2003: RCM No. 405\u2013Additional Measures for the Improvement of the Supply of \nRural Settlement with Drinking Water and Natural Gas. \n7  Office of the President, 12 June 2008: Further Improvement of Potable Water Supply for the Populations of Rural \nSettlements and Towns and Economic use of Natural Gas. \n ", "3 \nlivelihood  conditions,  particularly  for  the  benefit  of  women;  (viii)  ensure  environmental \ncompliance by encouraging conservation of water resources, economic use of water, consistent \nwater  quality  control,  and  sound  management  of  wastewater;  and  (ix)  improve  further \noperational  strategies  by  strengthening  the  sector  institutional  setup  and  interagency \ncollaboration, and by promoting adequate capacity building. \n \n10.  Sector  Institutions.  Three  main  government  agencies  have  been  entrusted  with \nregulatory  responsibilities  related  to  water  resource  management  and  conservation.  The \nMinistry of Agriculture and Water Resources has overall responsibility for all large-scale surface \nwater development for irrigation. The State Committee on Geology and Mineral Resources is \nresponsible for groundwater investigation, management, monitoring, and protection. The State \nInspectorate for Regulating the Use of Water in Industry and Mining regulates the exploration, \ndevelopment, and conservation of thermal and mineral water.  \n \n11.  UCSA has overall responsibility for improving WSS services in the country. It (i) drafts \npolicies, strategies, and standards for the sector; (ii) provides regulatory advice to support \nreforms in the sector; (iii) monitors the compliance of local authorities and commercial entities \nwith sector policies; and (iv) attracts foreign investment to the sector. The Ministry of Economy, \nin collaboration with UCSA, has a significant role in sector planning, while the Ministry of \nFinance reviews tariffs and controls and approves external financing for the sector. The State \nCommittee for De-monopolization and Supporting Competition and Entrepreneurship monitors \napplications for tariffs for all communal services, including WSS. The Department of Finance in \neach province is authorized to approve tariffs, which are prepared by the urban and district \nvodokanals in their respective provinces. \n \n12.  The State Committee for Nature Protection is entrusted with the task of protecting and \nmanaging  the  environment.  The  state  committee  implements  the  government  policy  of \nprotecting natural environment and water resources by monitoring compliance with standards \nfor  urban  and  industrial  effluents.  The  State  Sanitary  and  Epidemiological  Inspectorate,  a \ndepartment of the Ministry of Health, implements sanitary supervision of drinking water for \ncompliance  with  national  sanitary  norms.  Through  its  provincial  and  district  sanitary  and \nepidemiological services (SES) divisions, the state inspectorate monitors the quality of drinking \nwater in both urban and rural distribution networks, and the environmental health conditions in \npublic sanitation facilities. \n \n13.  The  day-to-day  WSS  services  are  operated  by  district  and  city  vodokanals.  The \nprovincial administration receives reports from the provincial vodokanal, which coordinates and \nmonitors the performance of the district and city vodokanals in the province. In addition, six \ninterregional  water  supply  agencies  manage  and  operate  interregional  trunk  mains  in  the \ncountry.  These  agencies  cover  several  districts  or  even  operate  across  provinces.  They \nabstract, transmit, and distribute water to consumers. Some supply water in bulk to district or \ncity vodokanals, while others operate as large vodokanals. \n \n14.  Sector Reforms. The Government of Uzbekistan recognizes the need to reform the \noperation and management of the WSS sector according to market economy principles. It has \ntherefore begun a number of key reforms including (i) gaining access to external funding for \ncapital works, (ii) metering customer supply, (iii) decentralizing responsibility for the day-to-day \nrunning of the facilities to the vodokanals, and (iv) allowing tariffs to reflect the full cost recovery \nof investment. The WSS sector was targeted for privatization in 2002. But privatization, which in \nthis  case  meant  divestment  of  assets,  failed  to  attract  support  because  of  the  lack  of  a \nwell-developed regulatory framework, the poor condition of the systems, and the insufficient \nnumber of qualified private sector investors. \n \n ", "4 \n15.  Sector  Development  Targets.  The  National  Water  Supply  Development  Program \n(NWSDP) developed in 1999 targeted close to 100% coverage in most urban areas and 85% in \nrural areas by 2010. This goal is unattainable. World Bank estimates suggest that infrastructure \ninvestment in the order of $1.4 billion will just about cover the rehabilitation of the infrastructure. \nTwice as much could be needed to increase population coverage and reach the goals of the \nNWSDP.  A  revised  strategy  is  needed  to  revisit  the  targets  and  the  NWSDP,  taking  into \nconsideration integrated water resource management, cost-effective options for developing the \nWSS systems, the needed reforms, and nonphysical interventions. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n16.  The  WSS  systems  inherited  from  the  Soviet  Union  have  reached  the  end  of  their \neconomic life and require extensive rehabilitation. The provision of reliable, safe, and affordable \nWSS services to the population, in the face of deteriorated infrastructure, an outdated sector \nstrategy  and  planning,  inappropriate  standards,  limited  financial  resources,  and  weak \ninstitutional capacity, is a key challenge to the Government. A problem tree analysis of the \nsector is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n17.  Infrastructure  Constraints.  Despite  being  increasingly  difficult  to  maintain,  an \nextensive network still exists, albeit operating at low service levels. Most of the systems were \nbuilt with materials and equipment of poor quality. Water supply pipes are made of untreated \nsteel,  so  corrosion  presents  a  problem  for  both  short-term  maintenance  and  long-term \ndepreciation.  Submersible  pumps  function  for  less  than  a  year  before  requiring  a  major \noverhaul.8 With limited funds, vodokanals routinely rewind burned-out electrical motors and \ncarry out \u201cBand-Aid\u201d operations on leaking pipes just to keep the systems operating at a low \nlevel of service. High-density polyethylene pipes and high-grade equipment are now available in \nthe country and, where funds permit, are being used in systems rehabilitation. The assessment \nby the World Bank suggests that 60% of the infrastructure needs to be replaced.  \n \n18.  Outdated  Sector  Strategy  and  Planning.  Planning  in  the  sector  remains  highly \ncentralized and focused on the simple replacement of pipes, pumps, and wells as the basis for \ndetermining investment needs. This implies that centralized pipe networks or sewerage systems \nwill  be  rehabilitated  or  new  ones  built  exactly  as  they  were  20\u201350  years  ago.  Alternative \nleast-cost solutions are not sought. For the sector to function efficiently, planning must be \ndecentralized to allow local planners to develop their own options. Planning data are unreliable, \nand often consist of a collection of physical information (such as kilometers of pipe laid) rather \nthan information about key outcomes, such as actual service coverage and quality of service \nprovided. The investment plan prepared under the NWSDP covers only investment needs until \n2010 and is outdated and inaccurate. For a more accurate assessment of long-term investment \nneeds, a sector road map and a comprehensive sector development program must be prepared \nto reflect actual service coverage and conditions, and identify the measures and investments \nneeded to achieve the sector\u2019s goals up to 2020. Although the Government is interested in \npromoting private sector involvement in WSS service provision, policy and regulatory support is \ninadequate and the sector needs to be restructured to attract more private interest. To promote \npublic-private partnership (PPP) in the sector more efficiently, a comprehensive study is needed \nto understand the PPP potentials, major constraints, and opportunities. \n \n19.  Inappropriate Standards and Designs. Standards used in Uzbekistan are derived from \nthose that were used in the Soviet Union. Consumption levels for consumers have been set at \n100\u2013350 liters per capita per day (lpcd), leading to the design of high-capacity systems and \n                                                 \n8  Ebinger, Jane. 2006. Measuring Financial Performance in Infrastructure: An Application to Europe and Central \nAsia. World Bank: Washington, DC. \n ", "5 \nlarge pipes and pumps. Systems are thus highly capitalized, and the combination of long \npipelines and high flow rates have resulted in high energy consumption and high operating \ncosts. Rigid design standards make it difficult to apply alternative service options, such as \ntanker delivery to remote rural communities. In the sanitation sector, all wastewater treatment \nplants  follow  a  similar  design.  Alternatives  such  as  stabilization  ponds  (with  anaerobic, \nfacultative, and maturation lagoons) may be cost-effective and environmentally sound options in \nareas with access to agricultural land. Methane gas can be extracted from the anaerobic ponds \nfor energy and the treated water used for irrigation. But these options have not yet been \nconsidered.  \n \n20.  Limited  Financial  Resources.  WSS services under the Soviet Union were heavily \nsubsidized by the central government. System planning did not focus on cost recovery or \nleast-cost design options. Consumption was based on normative design values and tariffs were \nset at a nominal rate and de-linked from required capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts for sustainable service provision. A disconnection policy was in place but rarely enforced; \nquite often consumers were able to negotiate a partial payment. The cash flow problem this \ncreated rendered the vodokanals unable to meet O&M costs, let alone depreciation allowance \nand capital requirements for system expansion. As a result, they cut routine maintenance and \nreduced service duration to control operating costs. With no capital reserves, the vodokanals \noften had to resort to emergency funds from the provincial government or even on occasion \nfrom  the  makhalla 9  committees  to  replace  worn-out  equipment,  often  with  poor-quality \nreplacements. The consumers, poorly served, understandably resisted paying for the services. \nThe average collection rate is still only about 50%. \n \n21.  Weak Institutional Capacity. Institutional capacity at all levels is weak. UCSA, which is \nresponsible  for  the  overall  management  and  development  of  the  sector,  mostly  identifies \nprojects for external funding, implements investment projects, and manages interregional trunk \nmains. It has limited capability to address long-term sector needs such as sector strategies and \nplans, as well as guidelines for assessing projects and preparing project proposals, and for \ntransmitting  this  information  to  the  provinces.  The  vodokanals,  which  are  responsible  for \noperating the water supply systems, need to manage better and improve their technical capacity. \nVodokanal staff have little opportunity for internal training. Positions do not come with duty \nstatements, and there are no operations manuals or maintenance logs. Functioning offices with \nfiling systems are rare. The consumer database does not reflect all consumers and there is little \ncustomer  orientation.  UFW  is  impossible  to  determine,  and  performance  monitoring  and \nbenchmarking systems are rarely adopted. \n \n22.  Need for Integrated Water Resources Management. Water resources management \nfor surface waters is the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and \ngroundwater that of the State Committee on Geology and Mineral Resources, and the WSS \nsector is under UCSA. While the WSS sector uses only about 3.8% of water resources, high \nstandards are required to maintain potable quality. National and provincial planning should \nensure that estimates of known groundwater reserves are updated regularly, and that resources \nare protected for future use. Leakage of drainage water from irrigation has salinized some \nshallow aquifers, which could have been used as local water sources for rural communities.  \n \n23.  The Project will deal with these challenges and support sector development by tackling \nfour issues: (i) shortfalls in policy and standards, (ii) investment needs, (iii) sector and business \nmanagement, and (iv) operational and institutional gaps. The Project will work with both national \nand provincial governments. At the national level, the Project will help the Government to build a \nvision and a big picture for the sector as a whole by strengthening the essential policies and \n                                                 \n9 The smallest administrative group in a community. \n ", "6 \nstrategies, developing a sector road map, and preparing a comprehensive sector development \nprogram. A PPP framework will also be prepared together with the sector strategy to enable the \nGovernment  to  promote  private  sector  involvement  in  the  sector  in  a  systematic  way. \nExperience from the KfW-funded PPP program with Obi Hayot (a private agricultural company) \ninvolving water supply and sanitation service improvements at seven farms will provide an \nexample for possible future investments.  \n \n24.  At  the  provincial  level,  the  Project  will  set  up  an  urban  WSS  services  model  in \nSurkhandarya Province, which can be replicated and expanded in other provinces. The service \nimprovement  targets  of  the  Project  are  given in  Table  1.  Besides  investments  in  physical \ninfrastructure for system rehabilitation and necessary upgrading, the Project will address the \ncritical  planning,  management,  financial,  operational,  and  customer  relations  needs  of  the \nvodokanals. These will entail changing the business culture, introducing and strengthening \nplanning  tools  and  processes,  computerizing  financial  management  systems,  modernizing \naccounting and reporting standards, reforming tariffs to allow full cost recovery, developing a \ncustomer  database  and  customer  care  systems,  improving  collection  procedures  and \nprocesses, developing operational manuals, introducing a performance benchmarking system, \nand providing associated training. A design and monitoring framework for the Project is provided \nin Appendix 2 and a project road map is in Appendix 3. \n \nTable 1: Service Improvement Targets \nIndicator  Current Level  Project Target \nSystem coverage  76%  >85% \nService duration  2\u201310 hrs  >20 hrs \nUnaccounted-for water  >60%  <40% \n \n25.  External Assistance. External financiers in the Uzbekistan WSS sector include , the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nGerman  development  cooperation  through  KfW,  World  Bank,  and  the  governments  of  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Spain, \nSwitzerland, and the US. As of 2007, external assistance to the sector amounted to about $270 \nmillion equivalent\u2014about $140 million rural and $130 million urban. In addition, KfW financed \nthe improvement of water supply in seven rural farm areas in Khorezm with \u20ac12.3 million \nthrough Obi Hayot, a private operator. The Government of PRC has made a concessional loan \nof $17.3 million for a national water meter installation program. External assistance to the sector \nis  summarized  in  Appendix  4.  Project  preparation  is  being  coordinated  closely  with  the \ndevelopment  partners  to  ensure  consistency  in  institutional  approaches  and  a  coordinated \npolicy approach with the Government. \n \n26.  Lessons. The project design pays special attention to avoiding the following problems \nencountered in previous WSS projects: (i) start-up delays related to delayed project feasibility \nstudy  preparation  and  approval,  (ii)  funding  scattered  over  several  provinces  and  wide \ngeographic areas with little scope for achieving a critical mass, (iii) unnecessary complexity in \nproject design and implementation, (iv) lack of a sector strategy and updated comprehensive \ninvestment plan, (v) need to inculcate a commercial customer orientation in the vodokanals, \n(vi) need  to  allocate  sufficient  funds  for  developing  management  and  operational  skills  of \nvodokanals, (vii) need for performance monitoring and benchmarking of vodokanals to monitor \nproject impact and provide accurate information for vodokanal management and operations, \nand (viii) inadequate counterpart project financing. \n ", "7 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n27.  When completed in 2014, the Project will improve living standards, the environment, and \npublic health for about 340,000 people living in Surkhandarya Province. Its outcome will be safe, \nreliable,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  and  improved \ncommunity hygiene. \nB.  Outputs \n28.  The Project has five components: \n1.  Strengthening of Sector Strategy and Management \n29.  This component will promote the economic use of water resources and improve water \nsupply and wastewater sector planning and management. It comprises the development of \n(i)   an  integrated  water  sector  profile;  (ii)  a  water  supply  and  wastewater  sector  strategy, \nincluding a PPP framework; and (iii) a water supply and wastewater sector development road \nmap  and  comprehensive  investment  plan.  Sector  issues  and  constraints\u2014restructuring  for \neconomic  scale,  least-cost  technical  options  and  models,  corporate  governance  and \nmanagement,  regulatory  framework  and  proper  PPP  models,  tariff  and  cost  recovery,  and \ncapacity development\u2014will be analyzed in detail. Reforms recommended for dealing with these \nconstraints will be incorporated into an action-oriented road map and reflected in the sector \ninvestment program. The analytical work will lay a solid foundation for progressively addressing \nthe sector development issues. Details of this component are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n2.  Water Supply Development \n30.  This component will develop safe, affordable, and reliable piped water supply systems. It \ninvolves  the  development  of  (i)  boreholes  at  identified  groundwater  sources,  (ii) water \ntransmission facilities, (iii) service reservoirs, (iv) chlorination facilities, (v) distribution networks, \n(vi) individual metered service connections, and (vii) structural improvements in office buildings \nfor each subproject. Equipment for O&M of the water supply systems will also be procured \nunder this component. Appropriate PPP models for water supply service delivery will also be \nexplored and possibly pilot tested, if such potential exists. \n \n31.  The  subprojects  selected 10  all  share  the  following  characteristics:  (i) a  partially \nfunctioning  water  supply  system,  (ii)  closeness  to  a  surface  or  groundwater  source, \n(iii) closeness to water trunk mains, and (iv) good economic growth prospects. The focus on city \nand district centers and surrounding settlements has three significant advantages. It (i) provides \na critical mass of domestic consumers and commercial businesses, (ii) allows the vodokanals to \noperate as financially viable enterprises, and (iii) establishes a strong core operational group, \nwhich will allow phased expansion to other settlements in future years. \n3.  Sanitation and Hygiene \n32.  This  component  will  develop  improved  sanitation  practices  and  positive  hygiene \nbehavior among schoolchildren to prevent disease and ensure maximum health benefits from \nthe improved infrastructure services. Safe drinking water will be provided to all schools in the \n                                                 \n10 Termez city and the districts of Angor, Djarkurgan, Kizirik, Kumkurgan, Muzrabad, Sariasiya, and Shurchi. \n ", "8 \nproject  areas  as  part  of  the  water  supply  component.  This  component  will  provide \ncomplementary investment in (i) toilet blocks for a selected number of schools, and (ii) hygiene \npromotion activities in all schools in the project areas. Children are the key target group for \nhygiene activities, and schools are the entry point. Gender-specific actions relating to hygiene \npromotion are set out in the gender action plan. The activities and hygiene messages will be \nappropriately sequenced with WSS investments, and innovative and imaginative ways will be \nused to spread hygiene messages. The program will develop a network of stakeholders to \nsupport  the  activities,  including  neighborhood  makhalla  committees,  schoolteachers,  and \nnongovernment organizations such as the Red Crescent. A baseline survey and follow-up \nsurveys will be financed to guide the development of targeted hygiene messages and an \nassessment  of  the  impact  of  the  activities.  Details  of  this  component  are  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n4.  Capacity Development for Service Delivery \n33.  This  component  will  improve  management  capacity  and  efficiency,  foster \nprofessionalism among the vodokanals, and develop a better customer orientation to improve \nservices  in  the  long  term.  The  component  will  finance  investments  in  (i)  vodokanal  office \nfurniture  and  basic  office  equipment  to  computerize  the  management  of  vodokanals; \n(ii) technical, operational, and management training for vodokanals, and guidance and training \nin public awareness and customer care systems for vodokanals and a range of stakeholders, \nincluding makhalla committees, communities, schoolteachers, women, and households; (iii) the \ndevelopment and implementation of a performance monitoring and benchmarking system for \nvodokanals  in  Surkhandarya;  and  (iv)  study  tours  to  expose  vodokanal  staff  and  key \ngovernment officials to national and international best practices in professional WSS delivery. \nDetails of this component are provided in Supplementary Appendix C. Gender issues in training \nand gender-sensitive training activities are set out in the gender action plan. \n5.  Project Implementation Assistance \n34.  This component will provide project management support to the project management \nunit (PMU) and the project implementation unit (PIU) in implementing the Project. Assistance \nwill be provided in (i) project management and monitoring; (ii) bid document preparation and \nprocess  management;  (iii)  bid  evaluation;  (iv)  financial  management  and  accounting; \n(v) construction  supervision;  (vi)  social,  environment,  and  resettlement  management  and \nmonitoring; and (vii) incremental administrative costing for the PMU and the PIU.  \nC.  Special Features \n35.  Long\u2013Term Partnership and Public-Private Partnerships. The Project will pave the \nway for a long-term partnership with the Government in the WSS sector. It will work with both \nnational and provincial governments. At the national level, the Project will help the Government \nbuild a vision for the sector by strengthening the essential policies and strategies, developing a \nsector road map, and preparing a comprehensive sector development program and a PPP \nframework. At the provincial level, the Project will set up an urban WSS services model in \nSurkhandarya Province, which can be replicated and expanded in other provinces. Besides \ninvestments in physical infrastructure for system rehabilitation and necessary upgrading, the \nProject will address the critical planning, management, financial, operational, and customer \nrelations needs of the provincial and district vodokanals. Private operators will be involved in the \nformulation of sector strategy and the design of the PPP framework. PPP pilot projects11 will be \n                                                 \n11 Management contracts for operating and maintaining the project facilities. \n ", "9 \nimplemented.  The  involvement  of  the  private  operators  from  the  early  stages  of  project \nimplementation will ensure that the sector strategy and PPP framework are responsive to \nprivate  sector  development.  The  pilot  projects  will  target  small  towns,  the  easiest  market \nsegment for private operators to start with in Uzbekistan. \n \n36.  Change  in  Business  Culture  and  Management. Because of the heavy subsidies \ntraditionally provided to the sector, as well as the deteriorated systems, inadequate resources, \nlow tariffs, and poor payment discipline in the sector, water supply in Uzbekistan is widely \nperceived  to  be  a  loss-suffering  business.  The  vodokanals  have  become  reactive  service \nproviders  without  adequate  incentives  to  expand  their  customer  base.  As  a  result,  their \nmanagement  is  not  forward-looking,  their  staff  members  are  inadequately  motivated,  daily \noperating procedures are abandoned, and consumer complaints are not properly recorded and \nresponded to. The Project will demonstrate the financial viability of water supply services and \nmake  the  vodokanals  more  autonomous  and  accountable,  by  investing  in  infrastructure \nimprovements, introducing needed institutional and financial reforms, and enhancing the skills \nand capability of vodokanal staff. Vodokanals will be given more incentives to improve their \nperformance and expand their business, procedures will be prepared and implemented in daily \noperations, performance will be benchmarked, and a consumer complaint mechanism will be \ndeveloped and adopted. The vodokanals should thus be transformed gradually from reactive to \nbusiness-oriented service providers, with a forward-looking strategy and internal incentives to \nupgrade knowledge and skills, control costs, improve performance, and expand their customer \nbase. Consumers\u2019 rights and customer contracts between the vodokanals and their customers \nwill become a core part of the vodokanals\u2019 business culture. \n \n37.  Metering. The water meter is the cash register and a critical management tool in water \nsupply  systems.  Together  with  volumetric  pricing,  it  provides  an  incentive  for  water \nconservation, thereby  protecting water resources and enabling the postponement of costly \nsystem expansion. It also allows vodokanals to better locate distribution losses and charge for \nwater consumption on the basis of use\u2014generally perceived to be the fairest way of allocating \nthe costs of water supply to users. However, most water consumers and water production and \npumping facilities in Uzbekistan are not metered, preventing vodokanals from properly planning, \ncharging  for,  and  measuring  their  operation.  The  Project  will  provide  water  meters  for  all \nproduction, distribution, and consumption, and thereby create an essential foundation for many \naspects of vodokanal operations, including business planning and management, water loss \nreduction, efficient O&M, revenue collection, and performance measurement and targeting. \n \n38.  Performance  Benchmarking.  Performance  benchmarking  is  another  important \nmanagement  and  planning  tool  for  utility  management.  The  results  of  the  benchmarking \nprogram will help sector decision makers and vodokanal managers understand more precisely \nwater supply service performance, difficulties, and challenges, and compare performance with \nother water utilities in the region, the country, and even worldwide. The decision makers and \nmanagers  can  thus  come  up  with  more  relevant  decisions  and  actions  to  improve  sector \nmanagement and development, set realistic service targets, and strengthen the performance of \nvodokanals. Performance benchmarking is also essential in sector regulation and provides \nimportant reference information for setting service standards and reviewing tariffs. Performance \nbenchmarking is not practiced in Uzbekistan, however, mainly because there are not enough \nmeters installed. Once meters are installed, the Project will help each subproject vodokanal \ndevelop and implement a simple benchmarking system with one or two indicators for each key \nperformance area (technical, financial, institutional, and customer services). Training will be \nprovided to build the capacity to collect, analyze, and compare the data as part of ongoing \nperformance monitoring. This process of performance monitoring will help set the basis for \nfurther reforms in the sector, including PPPs. \n ", "10 \nD.  Cost Estimates \n39.

The committee will meet as \noften  as  required,  but  at  least  once  every  6 months,  to  review  and  discuss  project \nimplementation. \n \n43.  UCSA, the EA, will have overall responsibility for project coordination, implementation, \nand cooperation with ADB and with other government ministries and departments. The agency \nis headed by a director general, who is assisted by one deputy and 29 professional and \ntechnical staff. Having been the EA for two earlier projects supported by ADB, UCSA has the \nrequired technical, financial, and managerial capability to implement the Project. It meets ADB\u2019s \nminimum financial management requirements and has the financial management capability to \nsatisfactorily  record  all  transactions  and  balances,  support  the  preparation  of  regular  and \nreliable financial statements and financial monitoring reports, and arrange for annual audits to \nbe carried out in a manner acceptable to ADB. The UCSA training center is also equipped to \ndevelop the necessary capacity in the sector, including the capacity for project implementation \nand management. \n \n ", "12 \n44.  A PMU15 will be set up in UCSA before the loan negotiations to (i) continue the project \npreparatory work; (ii) supervise overall project implementation, budgeting, financial planning, \nand  accounting;  (iii)  recruit  the  consultants  and  coordinate  and  supervise  their  activities, \nadminister  their  contracts,  and  procure  civil  works  and  goods  for  the  Project;  (iv)  provide \nadministrative  and  technical  support  to  the  PIU;  (v)  prepare  consolidated  project  progress \nreports and a project completion report; and (vi) consolidate project accounting, auditing, and \nmonitoring and reporting to ADB, the Government, and other stakeholders.  \n \n45.  A PIU16 will be set up in Surkhandarya Province before the loan takes effect. The PIU \nwill  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation  at  the  local  level.  Its  major \nresponsibilities  will  involve  (i)  participating  in  project  planning,  detailed  design,  and  bid \nevaluation;  (ii)  coordinating  the  activities  of  consultants  and  contractors  in  the  province; \n(iii) overseeing construction activities; (iv) coordinating resettlement; (v) monitoring the social \nand  gender  and  environmental  impact  of  the  project  activities;  (vi)  supervising  local \ncapacity-building  activities;  and,  (vii)  preparing  and  consolidating  subproject  accounting, \nauditing, and monitoring reports for submission to the PMU. \n2.  Implementation Period \n46.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from early 2009 to March 2014. The \nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 7.  \n3.  Procurement \n47.  Goods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and the procurement plan for the \nProject.  The  procurement  plan  will  be  updated  at  least  yearly  for  the  next  18  months  of \nprocurement activities. International competitive bidding procedures will be used for major civil \nworks contracts costing more than $2,000,000 equivalent and supply contracts worth more than \n$500,000  equivalent.  Civil  works  valued  at  $100,000\u2013$2,000,000  and  goods  valued  at \n$100,000\u2013$500,000 will be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB) according to \nthe  NCB  annex  in  the  procurement  plan,  which  summarizes  modifications  or  clarifications \nneeded  in  the  Borrower\u2019s  procedures  to  enable  it  to  carry  out  NCB  under  ADB-financed \nprojects. Shopping procedures will be followed for works, materials, and equipment packages \ncosting up to $100,000. Indicative contract packages and applicable procurement procedures \nare listed in Appendix 8. \n4.  Consulting Services \n48.  A total of 568 person-months of consulting services (51 international and 517 national) \nwill be required in the fields of project management, water resource planning and management, \nWSS  engineering,  wastewater  management,  environmental  assessment  and  management, \nhydrogeology, financing and accounting, social assessment and safeguarding, and institutional \ndevelopment and support. The consultants will assist in (i) developing a water supply and \nwastewater  sector  strategy  and  investment  program,  (ii)  preparing  contract  packages  and \n                                                 \n15  The PMU will consist of (i) a project director; (ii) a deputy project director, who will also serve as the sector strategy \nstudy manager; (iii) a financial specialist\u2013cum\u2013accountant; (iv) a water supply and sanitation specialist, (v) a \nprocurement specialist, (vii) a monitoring and environment specialist, (vii) a driver, and (vi) an office manager\u2013\ncum\u2013translator.  \n16 The PIU will consist of (i) a project coordinator; (ii) a financial specialist\u2013cum\u2013accountant; (iii) a water supply \ndesign specialist; (iv) a monitoring, social issues, and resettlement specialist; (v) a driver; and (vi) an office \nmanager\u2013cum\u2013translator. \n ", "13 \ntender  documents  and  procuring  goods  and  services,  (iii)  supervising  construction  and \nevaluating project activities, (iv) guiding and supervising resettlement, (v) monitoring the social \nand  gender  and  environmental  impact  of  project  activities,  (vi)  coordinating  the  capacity \ndevelopment  program,  (vii)  implementing  the  school  sanitation  and  hygiene  program,  and \n(viii) supporting other activities of the PMU and the PIU.  \n \n49.  The selection and engagement of consulting services to be financed by ADB will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) and the procurement plan. Their selection will be based on: (i) the quality and \ncost of the services, according to the technical proposal (full or simplified); (ii) the consultants\u2019 \nqualifications, for small assignments costing less than $200,000 per contract; and (iii) individual \nconsultant selection, for very small assignments costing less than $100,000. The consulting \nservice  contract  packages  and  applicable  recruitment  methods  are  set  out  in  Appendix  8. \nOutline terms of reference for the consulting services for project implementation assistance are \ngiven in Appendix 9.  \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n50.  The Government has undertaken a series of measures, which can be considered part of \nits anticorruption plan. These include (i) legal reforms intended to improve the fairness and \neffectiveness of judiciary and court system; (ii) reform of public sector management, especially \npublic financial management and tax reforms; (iii) de-monopolization measures to make the \nprivate sector more competitive; and (iv) procurement measures. The Government is also active \nin  international  anticorruption  activities;  in  2008  it  approved  a  bill  proposing  the  country\u2019s \ninclusion in the UN Anti-Corruption Convention. \n \n51.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  UCSA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be included in \nthe loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. EA, PMU, and PIU staff \nwill receive training in ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy under the project implementation assistance \ncomponent. \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n52.  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To make sure that the loan proceeds and \ncounterpart funds are released on time and to speed up project implementation, UCSA, as the \nEA, will establish and maintain imprest accounts immediately after the loan takes effect in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.17  UCSA will be responsible for the use, \nmanagement,  replenishment,  and  liquidation  of  the  project  imprest  accounts,  under  the \nsupervision of the Ministry of Finance. \n  \n53.  Disbursements from the imprest accounts will be supported by appropriate withdrawal \napplications and related documentation. Such documentation will demonstrate that the works, \n                                                 \n17 There will be two separate imprest accounts\u2014one for the loan and one for the grant. \n ", "14 \ngoods, or services (i) were produced in and procured from ADB member countries, and (ii) are \neligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited into each imprest account will not \nexceed the estimated expenditure to be funded from the imprest account in the first 6 months or \n10% of the amount of the loan or grant, whichever is less. Eligible expenditures may be \nreimbursed and liquidated, and the corresponding imprest account replenished, through the \nstatement-of-expenditure (SOE) procedure; each payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under \nthis procedure should not exceed $100,000 in the case of the loan or $10,000 in the case of the \ngrant. \n \n54.  The PIU will set up subproject accounts with a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, and \nwill be responsible for the use, management, replenishment, and liquidation of the accounts, \nbased on the submission of full supporting documentation to the PMU. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n55.  The UCSA, through the PMU, the SPG, and the PIU, will (i) maintain separate accounts \nfor the Project, and (ii) have such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB, as provided in the Loan Agreement and required by \nADB for the financial reporting and auditing of ADB-financed projects. The imprest accounts and \nSOE records will also be audited during the annual audit and a separate audit opinion on the \nuse of each imprest account and SOE will be submitted to ADB. Certified copies of such audited \naccounts and financial statements in English, and the related reports of auditors, also in English, \nwill be submitted by the Government to ADB within 6 months after each financial year. For this \npurpose, the Government may use the proceeds of the loan or the grant (or both) to finance the \nservices of private sector auditors and the translation of their reports into English, provided that \nsuch auditors (i) have qualifications, expertise, and terms of reference acceptable to ADB; and \n(ii) have been recruited in a manner acceptable to ADB. \n \n56.  UCSA  will  submit  to  ADB  consolidated  quarterly  progress  reports in  English  on  all \naspects of project implementation, including resettlement. The reports will give the details of \noverall implementation progress, problems encountered during the reporting period, measures \ntaken or proposed to remedy these problems, and the proposed program of activities for the \nnext quarter. Within 3 months of project completion, UCSA will prepare and submit to ADB, in a \nformat acceptable to ADB, a project completion report on the use and impact of the loan; the \nperformance of the Project; the economic and social benefits generated; and implementation, \ncosts, and resettlement, details as well as other information requested by ADB. \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n57.  The PMU will implement a project performance monitoring system (PPMS) for each \nsubproject to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the subproject benefits accrued. \nA  system  framework  and  indicative  indicators  have  been  prepared.  The  PMU,  with  the \nassistance of the consultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures and plans within \n6 months after the loan takes effect. The PPMS activities\u2014the establishment of baseline data \nand benchmarks, the collection of information, the monitoring and evaluation of benefits, and \nthe evaluation of social impact\u2014will be carried out by the PMU through the PIU with the support \nof the consultants. Data will be collected at the same time as the socioeconomic surveys before \neach  subproject  is  implemented.  Data  collection  will  then  be  done  regularly  during \nimplementation and for 3 months after physical completion. The results will be included in the \nproject progress and completion reports. \n ", "15 \n9.  Project Review \n58.  Review missions will be undertaken twice a year in the first 2 years and once a year \nthereafter. ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review 3 years after the start of \nproject  implementation.  These  reviews  will  involve  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  project \nimplementation  arrangements  and  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope  of  the  Project,  the \nprogress  of  implementation,  resettlement  and  environmental  safeguards,  community \ninvolvement, health education and hygiene, feedback from the PPMS, the performance of the \nconsultants,  the  progress  of  institutional  and  capacity  development,  and  the  possible \nreallocation of loan proceeds. The cost recovery mechanisms for each subproject will also be \nevaluated and remedial action will be taken as needed. \n10.  Project Implementation Plan \n59.  A  project  implementation  plan,  based  on  the  project  schedule,  implementation \narrangements, procurement packages, and assurances from the Government, is presented in \nSupplementary Appendix D. The plan specifies the key project management, implementation, \nand auditing and reporting activities during project implementation, with clear activity starting \nand due dates, responsible parties, and links between project activities. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n60.  General Gains. The Project will benefit approximately 340,000 residents by 2014 and \n367,000 residents by 2020 in the project areas by providing safe, reliable and inclusive piped \nwater supplies, improving sanitation, and promoting good hygiene behaviors. About 20% of the \npopulation of the province, and nearly 90% of the urban residents and over 30% of the rural \nresidents in the project areas, will benefit. The health benefits from the physical investments in \nsafe water supply will be maximized as people become more knowledgeable and better aware \nof health and hygiene issues and are able to avoid the drudgery associated with collecting \nwater, particularly for women. The economy of the region will benefit from increased productivity \nas health improves, less time is needed to collect water, and water supply services become \nmore reliable. Town residents will also benefit from lower water costs and from savings in \nhealth-care costs. \n \n61.  Poverty Reduction. All the project interventions will have a positive impact on the poor \ndirectly or indirectly. They will compose about 32% of the 340,000 project beneficiaries. Socially \ninclusive processes built into the Project will ensure that the poor benefit proportionately. They \nwill benefit through reduced drudgery, improved health, and reduced expenditure on health \ncare. Households will not be required to pay a connection charge and the costs of the meters \nwill be payable in installments over 3 years. Both policies will help make safe water supply more \naccessible to the poor. The tariffs recommended will be affordable to the poor. Systems will be \ndeveloped for monitoring equity of access to safe and reliable water supply in poor communities \nand at the project administration level, and a national social, poverty, and gender expert will be \nrecruited to oversee this monitoring throughout the Project. Together with the UCSA, the expert \nwill monitor the socioeconomic implications of the Project through all its phases as part of the \nPPMS. A summary poverty reduction and social development strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n62.  Gender Impact. While both men and women will benefit from project investments and \nactivities, women will benefit more from time savings, reduced drudgery, and improved family \nhealth. Women perform the bulk of household work with the help of children, particularly girls. \nThey are generally responsible for water collection, family hygiene and sanitation, and care for \n ", "16 \nsick family members. The socioeconomic analysis revealed that women and children spend an \naverage of 2 hours each day collecting water. Particular attention will be given to involving \nwomen  in  employment,  management,  decision  making,  and  learning  and  training  activities \nunder the Project. A national social, poverty, and gender expert will be hired to ensure the \nmainstreaming of gender in all Project components, especially the activities related to capacity \nbuilding, training, hygiene, sanitation, and monitoring and evaluation. A gender action plan \nbased on the gender analysis in Supplementary Appendix E can be found in Appendix 11. \n \n63.  Ethnic Minority Groups. The Project will not affect any indigenous peoples defined as \nsuch in ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The project areas are fairly homogeneous \nin ethnic composition. Eighty percent of the residents are Uzbek. The most numerous among \nthe other ethnic groups are the Tajik, who can be found in all the project districts and are a \nmajority population (55%) in Sariasiya district. About 100 Multan18 families live in Kizirik and \nSariasiya districts. People of other ethnicities are not many. The various ethnic groups do not \ndiffer in their water supply and sanitation needs. All will benefit directly from piped water supply, \nsanitation improvements, and better hygiene. A report on ethnic minorities (Supplementary \nAppendix F) prepared for the Project assesses the impact of the Project on ethnic groups, \naccording to government regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \n \n64.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The Project will not require any land acquisition \nand resettlement (LAR), and there will be no impact on structures since the pipelines will be laid \nalong existing roads and pathways. Only one subproject (Djarkurgan) will have some impact in \nthe form of crop losses and temporary land occupation, and will require a short resettlement \nplan that conforms to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). This subproject will affect \n21 households (156 persons). For each of the seven other subprojects, the absence of impact is \ndocumented in the due-diligence reports prepared by the EA. The short resettlement plan and \nthe due-diligence reports will be reviewed after detailed design, and updated plans and reports \nwill be submitted to ADB for approval before construction. The resettlement will be monitored by \nUCSA, with the help of international and national resettlement experts. The social safeguards \nare  summarized  in  Appendix  12,  the  short  resettlement  plan  for  Djarkurgan  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix G, and the due-diligence reports assessing the need for LAR for the \nremaining subprojects are in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n65.  Environmental Impact. The Project is classified as category B according to ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The provision \nof safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities is expected to have a significant positive \nimpact on the environment. Simple, appropriate, low-cost technology with no significant adverse \nenvironmental consequences will be used. The quality of the water resources selected for \ndevelopment has been reviewed and fit ADB norms. Any negative environmental impact will \nmainly be short term, possibly occurring during construction, and can easily be minimized by the \nproposed  mitigation  measures  and  environmentally  sound  engineering  and  construction \npractices. Initial environmental examination (IEE), including separate assessments for each of \nthe eight subprojects (Supplementary Appendix I), has been carried out for the Project. The IEE \nshowed  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impact.  The  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring procedures in the environmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP) will be \nfollowed to avoid the standard construction impact. A budget of $385,000 has been allocated for \nEMMP  implementation.  The  activities  include the  cleanup  of construction sites, the  proper \ndisposal of spoils, the grading and revegetation of damaged land, and protection of the public \nfrom  excessive  noise  and  dust  during  construction,  among  other  standard  environmental \nprocedures. A report on the implementation of the EMMP during construction will be submitted \nto ADB every 6 months. The summary IEE is in Appendix 13. \n                                                 \n18 This ethnic group, called Lyuli by the Uzbeks, has lived in Central Asia for centuries. \n ", "17 \n \n66.  Institutional Impact. The Project will help the Government define a coherent vision and \nstrategy  for  WSS  sector  development,  with  which  the  Government  can  coordinate  more \neffectively the development activities in the sector, including those of its development partners. \nThe recommendations in the PPP framework for tapping PPP potential and addressing the \nconstraints will enable the Government to promote greater private sector involvement in WSS. \nThe  institutional  reforms  intended  to  transform  vodokanals  into  business-oriented  service \nproviders\u2014financial and tariff reforms, customer registration, complaint redress mechanisms, \nand  performance  benchmarking\u2014together  with  the  management  tools  and  capacity \ndevelopment programs, will provide vodokanals with more internal incentives and capability to \ndeliver better WSS services.  \n \n67.  Economic Analysis. Economic benefits will be gained from improved access to safer, \nmore reliable, and affordable water supply and a cleaner environment in the project areas. \nEconomic analysis for the water supply component in each subproject area, according to ADB\u2019s \nguidelines and handbook,19 identified the following quantifiable economic benefits of improved \nwater supply services: non-incremental water consumption, valued at the average price20 of \nwater supplied from non-piped sources; and incremental water consumption, valued at the price \nconsumers are willing to pay. The eight subprojects have an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) ranging from 24.4% to 39.7%, for an average EIRR of about 32.1%. The economic \nanalysis is in Appendix 14, and detailed calculations are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n68.  Financial Evaluation. At present, costs related to the development and reconstruction \nof water supply systems are not considered in tariff determination. Water loss, electricity, and \nother material consumption norms are. However, with the networks and equipment in their \ncurrent state of deterioration, actual consumption exceeds the norms; hence, tariffs do not cover \nactual O&M expenses. Under the Project, tariffs will be increased to levels that will allow the full \nrecovery of O&M expenses, taxes, and depreciation by the vodokanals. The financial and \naffordability analyses show that the tariffs proposed under the Project, on the basis of the above \nprinciples, are affordable to all, including the poor households. If these tariffs are implemented, \nthe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for each subproject will be 5.1%\u20135.8%, higher than \nthe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 4.2%. All vodokanals are expected to have \npositive net cash flows after the project facilities start operating in 2014; no additional subsidy \nwill  be  needed.  The  financial  analysis  is  presented  in  Appendix  15,  and  details  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n \n69.  Risks. Five possible risks have been identified and addressed in the project design. \nFirst,  the  risk  of lack  of  commitment  to  a  comprehensive  sector  strategy  and  investment \nprogram is addressed by the broadly consultative and participatory approach to the strategy \nstudy, to ensure government ownership of the strategy, road map, and investment program. \nSecond, to avert delays in project start-up caused by the delayed preparation and approval of \nnationwide feasibility study, feasibility studies for all the subprojects have been conducted and \ncompleted in parallel with the project preparation and the Government has endorsed these \nstudies before loan negotiations. Third, to forestall delays in the provision of local counterpart \nfunds, assurances have been obtained from the Government that it will allocate and provide the \nfunds on time. Fourth, given the limited capability of vodokanals to meet the incremental O&M of \nthe  expanded  water  supply  systems,  the  capacity  development  component  of  the  Project \nincludes management improvement activities, tariff and financial reforms, and targeted training. \nLastly, to guard against the adverse effects of resettlement on poor and vulnerable households, \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 1997.

The average cost per household per \nyear, according to the survey, is about SUM76,000. \n ", "18 \nthe resettlement plans and other due-diligence arrangements will ensure that all affected people \nwill improve or at least maintain their living standards after the Project. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n70.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that development of the new water supply and \nwastewater sector strategy, road map, and investment program is carried out in \naccordance with the agreed process in consultation with stakeholders in the \nsector so that by December 2011 at least the agreed strategy is approved by the \nGovernment. The Government will keep ADB informed of major changes in the \nsector programs and plans that may affect this and future projects financed by \nADB. \n \n(ii)  The Government will make adequate annual budget allocations and release in a \ntimely manner the counterpart funds and other resources, as shall be necessary, \nin  addition  to  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  and  grant,  for  the  successful \nimplementation of the Project. \n \n(iii)  The Government will cause SPG and subproject vodokanals to take necessary \nmeasures to improve collection efficiency to achieve a collection rate of 90% for \neach subproject vodokanal by 2013. \n \n(iv)  The  Government  will  cause  the  SPG  to  review  semiannually  and  adjust  as \nnecessary the level and structure of water tariffs to ensure that (a) from 2010 \nonward,  the  vodokanals  will  be  able  to  fully  recover  O&M  and  capital \nreplacement costs; and (b) from 2014 onward, the vodokanals will be able to (i) \nrecover fully O&M and capital replacement costs, (ii) service their debts, and (iii) \nmaintain a debt service coverage ratio of 1.2:1. Results of the reviews and \nadjustments will be reported to ADB within 3 months of each review.  \n \n(v)  The Government will cause SPG to (a) take appropriate measures, including \nfinancial incentives and penalties, to reduce the level of water bill arrearages, \nand  (b)  protect  their  water  resources  and  facilities  through  the  vigorous \nprosecution of violations such as water meter tampering and water theft. \n \n(vi)  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate directly, or through its agents, \nany possible corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, the Government shall ensure that  (a) UCSA, in \nthe bidding documents for the Project, and in all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project, includes provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of PMU, PIU, and vodokanals, and \nall contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the Project; (b) periodic inspections of the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund \nwithdrawals and settlements are carried out; and (c) the project auditors have the \nright to conduct random or spot audits of contract implementation activities under \nthe Project. The cost of this auditing will be borne by the Project. \n \n ", "19 \n(vii)  UCSA will maintain and update its website to present information on externally \nfunded projects, including the Project.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n  \nThe Government of Uzbekistan, in coordination with international organizations, supported an in-depth poverty analysis in late \nJuly 2007. The Welfare Improvement Strategy and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (WIS/PRSP 2008\u20132010)a sets out a \nstrategy for improving living standards, especially for low-income and socially isolated groups. The strategy emphasizes the \nneed to improve access to municipal services that ensure decent living conditions (potable water supply has first priority) to \nimprove living standards. In this regard, the large gap between large urban centers and rural areas in access to infrastructure \nwidens the gap in living standards. Since 1990 the Government has implemented a targeted program for providing the \npopulation with clean potable water, which has increase the proportion of households with access to potable water supply, \nfrom 50% in 1990 to 82.6% by the start of 2007. According to the WIS, 1,312 more populated localities should be provided \nwith centralized water supply by 2008. \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program (2006\u20132010)b is well aligned with the Government\u2019s WIS/PRSP and is aimed at \npromoting pro-poor growth through four key strategic priorities. Of these four, the Project will directly contribute to the \nattainment of these two priorities: \n(i)  Accelerating environmentally sustainable rural development. Through the delivery of improved and more \naccessible water supply to more households in the urban as well as rural areas of Surkhandarya Province, the \nProject will enable families to participate more fully in economic activities, and reduce the costs of health care \ndue to water-related illnesses. Improvements in sanitation and hygiene promotion in schools will help maximize \nthe health benefits from safe water supply.  \n(ii)  Building the human capital of the poor. The Project will contribute to poverty reduction efforts by improving \nwater supply to the poor and female-headed households, and by delivering school sanitation and hygiene \nprograms. \nAssistance from international donors to the municipal services sector is critical. A number of projects that will supply safe \ndrinking water and wastewater treatment facilities are being prepared or implemented. Technical assistance is also required \nfor municipal services reform. The Government is planning reforms in municipal services, and the Project will contribute to \n(i) a gradual transition of municipal services enterprises from dependency on the government to financial independence; \n(ii) improved rate-setting policies and transparency; (iii) targeted support for low-income population groups; (iv) improved \nmaintenance,  repairs,  and  funding  for  the  municipal  services  system;  (v)  sustainable  funding  for  the  construction  of \ninterregional piped water supply systems; (vi) regional programs that will promote economic reforms; and (vii) a greater role \nfor local self-governing bodies (makhallas) in regulating municipal services and housing relationships. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n According to a World Bank study (2003) based on a household budget survey in the southern economic region, which \nincludes Surkhandarya Province, 27.6% of the population is living below the poverty line.c The PPTA socioeconomic survey \nconducted in 2007\u20132008 showed a household poverty rate of 33% in the seven subproject areas of Surkhandarya and 31% in \nTermez City - equivalent to a total of 109,600 people in the eight subproject areas. A poverty line in monetary terms is $37 per \nmonth in Termez and $19.4 per month in the seven other subproject areas. The average monthly income of families is $207 in \nTermez and $173 in the other seven areas. The average per capita income of the poor is one\u2013third the income of the \nnonpoor. Only 46.4% of the families surveyed were urban residents. \nNumerous studies, including the WIS, indicate that poverty in small towns in Uzbekistan is even higher than the poverty in \nrural areas, as access to land is limited for families in small towns, and there are much fewer employment opportunities in the \nstate-funded  sector  and  in  private  business  and  industry  than  in  big  cities.  Income  from  hired  employment  in  the \nnonagricultural sector is most significant for poor families, even in the small semi-urban settlements (27% of total income in \nSurkhandarya Province). The second-most-important income sources are social transfers and the marketing of agricultural \nproducts grown by the families themselves. Pensions and social transfers (including the social benefits of low-income \nhouseholds) contribute 23.9% of the income of poor families in Surkhandarya. Poor families have a higher share of \nunemployment (62%). More than 70% of the unemployed are women. Most of the poor are hired workers, employed in the \nagricultural or state-funded sectors, or self-employed people who cultivate their own small household plots (up to 0.1 hectare). \nPoor families spend about 48%\u201353% of total family income for foodstuffs. The level of meat product consumption is up to \nrequired standards only in 12% of families, while most of the diet is mostly carbohydrates (flour, potato) and fats (vegetable \noil). The education level of poor families is close to the national average of 91% having gone through primary school. \n ", "40  Appendix 10 \n \nHowever, the share of heads of households with secondary education in poor families is much lower (only 23%) than in \nnonpoor  families.  Low  income  and  limited  employment  opportunities  are  the  major  causes  of  poverty.  Employment \nopportunities are limited in all sectors of the economy, including the agricultural and state- funded sectors, because of the lack \nof jobs, low wages and irregular and unsure payments, and the low professional skills of the poor. As a result, labor migration \nis growing\u2014about 5% of families receive money from family members in other provinces or abroad. The agricultural sector is \nliving through the transformation of shirkat farms into private farms, a process that is triggering a significant labor surplus. \nLess than 3% of the people have become private farmers, and they try as much as possible to employ only family members \nas private farm workers. Self-employment opportunities are limited by the shortage of resources, the underdeveloped state of \nmarket institutions, legislative limitations, and lack of information about ways and opportunities of increasing income in the \nnew market economy. Families with few or no opportunities to find employment in the nonagricultural sector are obliged to \nbecome entrepreneurs, running small enterprises or being self-employed (in the largely unregistered small-scale trade).  \nBoth poor and nonpoor families have limited access to public utilities\u2014natural gas, electricity, and potable water. This \nproblem is particularly acute in areas outside Termez, where 32.5% of families have no access to natural gas supply, and \n71% of families encounter frequent electricity supply interruptions. Less than 2.5% of poor families have bathrooms with piped \nwater. Apart from some households in Termez, no households in the project areas have access to central sewerage. Water \nconsumption in poor families is lower by 21% than consumption in nonpoor families (9.9 liters per capita per day for the poor \nand 12.5 liters for the nonpoor). The quality of water poor families consume is also lower; irrigation canals are the main \nsources of water for 19% of the poor families in rural Surkhandarya. The problems associated with intermittent and low-\npressure water supply are 20% more frequent among poor families than among the nonpoor. Low-income households cannot \nafford to buy potable water, and over 20% use unsafe water from irrigation systems and shallow wells. \n2. Design Features  \nThe Project involves (i) the preparation of a sector strategy, a road map, and an investment plan up to 2020; (ii) the \nrehabilitation and construction of water supply systems in seven districts and Termez city; (iii) the building of capacity in the \nvodokanals to (a) use benchmarking to improve technical and financial efficiency, and (b) develop a commercial approach to \ncustomer services; and (iv) the adoption of the following pro-poor strategies to address the specific needs of the poor (which \nrepresent 32% of the projected 2014 population): \n(i)  Connection fees will be covered by the Project, thus removing a significant barrier to access by the poor. \n(ii)  Meters will be mandatory but provided by the Project and can be repaid over 3 years.  \n(iii)  A social, poverty, and gender expert will ensure that poor and vulnerable groups are able to gain access to project \nbenefits. \nStrategies (ii) and (iii) are available to both poor and nonpoor households but will be particularly effective in improving access \nfor the poor. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.        Findings of Social Analysis \nThe population of the settlements in the subproject areas, which comprise eight administrative districts, is more than 340,000 \n(127,000 in Termez and 213,000 in the other seven area), or about 69,700 families. The average family size is 5 persons in \nTermez and 5.9 persons in the other areas. Family size is bigger for poor households (6 persons in Termez and 6.6 in the \nseven other areas) compared with nonpoor households (4.6 in Termez and 5.6 in the other areas). Ninety-eight percent of \nfamilies live in their own houses, with land for a family house guaranteed by the state.  \nPotable water supply in the project areas is worsening. There are no metering devices, water supply is unreliable, and the \npopulation is unwilling to pay the current rates. According to the PPTA socioeconomic survey data, most of the households \nsurveyed, irrespective of their living standards, are face with a shortage of potable water. The average consumption of water \nfor drinking and household needs per day is less than 13 liters per capita (about 80 liters per family per day, versus the official \nstandard of 110 liters per capita per day). Ninety percent of Termez households and only 42% of the households in the seven \nother districts have piped water in their houses. However, over 13% of connections have never worked, and the rest are \ninoperable more than half of the time. No less than 35% of families in the project areas take water from several sources at a \ntime and use it for drinking and household needs. As a rule, even families that have piped water in their houses often use \nwater from a water post in the street for drinking and household needs (some 55% of families) or water brought by water \nvendors, or even water from canals.  \nDiarrhea incidence is five to seven times higher among families that take water from open water reservoirs than among \nfamilies with piped water. On average, the annual expenses for diarrhea treatment amount to about 8.7% of monthly family \nincome in the seven project districts and 6.9% in Termez. An average of 30% of children under 14 (male and female, urban \nand rural) bathe less than once a week. About 46% of the household time of Termez residents is spent collecting water, \ncompared with 75.3% for households in the seven other districts. Average distance to the main source of water is less than \n100 meters in Termez and more than 600 meters in the remaining subproject areas. An average family spends about 3.75 \nperson-days per month collecting water, versus 6.1 person-days per month in the other subproject districts. About 90%\u201395% \nof families store water for their drinking and household needs. Expenses on the construction of water storage reservoirs \n(khauzes) are especially high, amounting to $150 each. \nBecause of the lack of water, about half of households do not have special rooms for bathing. Although 43% of families \nsurveyed said that their houses have bathrooms, almost all have to bring water in buckets to those rooms. Only 24% of \n ", "Appendix 10  41 \n     \nhouseholds surveyed in Termez and 5% elsewhere have bathrooms connected to water pipelines. The residents of Termez \nand other small towns who have sewerage connections in their apartments cannot use them for lack of water. \nSocial  infrastructure  facilities  also  suffer  from  water  shortage.  In  the  project  areas,  more  than  600  institutions  and \norganizations, funded from the state budget, are now functioning\u2014most with limited water and sanitation. Kindergartens, \nschools, colleges, inpatient medical institutions, and hospitals all urgently need adequate water supply and improved \nsanitation facilities.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nParticipation occurred during the implementation of the PPTA through consultations with key stakeholders at both central and \nlocal government levels, and with area-based communities. The surveys conducted for the PPTA socioeconomic survey and \nthe resettlement plans, which covered 2,400 families, ensured that the issues brought up by the residents and their \npreferences were understood and that the target population was also informed about the project goals and objectives in \ngeneral. Data collection and analysis focused on vulnerable population groups, especially the poor, women, and ethnic \nminorities. In addition to surveys of families, interviews were conducted with chairpersons of all rural assemblies of citizens \nand urban makhallas within the project areas, which are essential to the wide dissemination of information in the country.  \nPress releases to TV, radio, and print media, as well as town meetings and presentations at some schools, were undertaken \nto supplement the survey and information exercise. \n1. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n2. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nA stakeholder analysis was developed within the social analysis component and extensive consultations were carried out \nduring project preparation. In addition, a capacity development TA is proposed, to help build the capacity of the water supply \ncompanies and the makhalla committees to represent their customers, develop public awareness, and address customer \ncomplaints. Therefore, a separate C&P plan is not envisaged. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nThe role of women in economy is extremely important, as women make up 47% of the labor resources of Uzbekistan. In the \nproject areas 47.5% of Surkhandarya women are at least temporarily employed. Despite the fact that women make a \nsignificant contribution to household budgets (35% of household income), they are employed mostly in the state-funded sector \nor do low-skilled manual labor, receiving lower wages than men. In the agricultural sector women can obtain only seasonal, \nlow-skilled manual jobs. Women\u2019s wages are about 80% of men\u2019s wages. \nMoreover, women take on the additional burden of housework, which is quite heavy. Women collect water, cultivate garden \nplots, tend the livestock and poultry, do the laundry, clean the house, cook, and take care of the children and older family \nmembers. Nine percent of those surveyed in Termez and 58% in the remaining districts do not have a source of water in their \nhouse yards and have to collect water elsewhere every day. Water delivery is largely (in 80% of cases) a responsibility of \nwomen and children, who have to bring home water twice or thrice a day, carrying 20\u201325 liters at a time. As potable water is \ngenerally of low quality, there is high incidence of water-related diseases among children (diarrhea was reported among 8% of \nall families in Termez and 11% in the seven other districts in the last 12 months). \nProviding households with adequate and good-quality potable water will have a positive impact on women. It will lighten their \nwork and allow them to spend more time in gainful employment. It also will have a positive impact on the health of all family \nmembers, especially children, further lessening the time pressures on women, who must also care for the old and the infirm \namong their household members. \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan         Other actions/measures         No action/measure \nTo enhance the positive impact of the Project on women and minimize the project-related risks to women and children, a \ngender action plan was developed within the social analysis component. It has the following key components: \n\u2022  The participation of a national social, poverty, and gender expert to ensure that gender issues receive priority during \nimplementation. \n\u2022  The participation of women in project planning and as a key target group for information campaigns. \n\u2022  Gender sensitivity training for key stakeholders (including vodokanals) to make them more fully aware of the important \nroles women play in water supply, sanitation, and hygiene behavior, involve women to a greater degree in management and \nplanning, and respond in a more gender-sensitive way to concerns raised by female clients. \n\u2022  The inclusion of women in management and monitoring, as equal partners in resolving issues. \n\u2022  The revision of human resource policies, procedures, and guidelines for the water supply companies (vodokanals) to \nensure greater gender-responsiveness. The URM gender adviser will participate in the process and assist in the updating of \n ", "42  Appendix 10 \n \nthe gender action plan. \n\u2022  A focus on primary schools for the sanitation and hygiene program (a significant number of girls do not progress to \nsecondary school), to ensure that girls are aware of good practices in water handling, hygiene, and sanitation and carry these \npractices into adulthood.  \n\u2022  The training of women in basic technical skills to ensure that they do not have to depend on males to address basic WSS \nproblems. \nIII.

Introduction \n1.  The  Surkhandarya  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  will  improve  health,  living,  and \nenvironmental conditions for the people residing in eight districts. The Uzbekistan Communal Services \nAgency  (UCSA)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA). The Project  will be  administered  by  a project \nmanagement unit (PMU) established at the central level under UCSA and implemented at the province \nlevel by a project implementation unit (PIU).  \n2.  The Project will primarily include the replacement of water supply systems in eight subprojects in \nSurkhandarya  Province.  Of  these  subprojects,  only  three  entail  new  construction  and  only  one \n(Djarkurgan) entails land acquisition and resettlement (LAR). In Djarkurgan, new construction will cause \nonly minimal impact in the form of crop losses. There will be no land acquisition or impact on trees, \nstructures, and residences. The Project will not entail impact on subjects classifiable as indigenous people \nunder the relevant ADB policy.  \n3.  In  accordance  with  Uzbek  law  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and \nOperations Manual section on involuntary resettlement,1 UCSA has prepared a short resettlement plan to \ndocument the LAR impact of the Djarkurgan subproject and plan the compensation and rehabilitation of \nthe affected families. In addition, seven due-diligence reports have been prepared to document the lack of \nimpact in the remaining seven subprojects. \nB.  Resettlement Plans \n4.  The short resettlement plan for the Djarkurgan subproject includes a detailed impact assessment \nand a census of affected persons showing that the subproject will cause only temporary land-use impact \nand crop losses to 4.75 hectares of arable land owned by 21 affected families with 156 members. The \nimpact will require providing the affected families with compensation for crops and appropriate land rental \nfees.  The  total  compensation  program  cost  under  the  short  resettlement  plan  is  $12,450,  with \ncontingencies.  The  short  resettlement  plan  provides  general  LAR-related  project  preparation  and \nimplementation conditions; a policy framework detailing all compensation and rehabilitation provisions; \nand  several  sections  related  to  public  consultation  and  disclosure,  the  organization  of  LAR  tasks, \ncomplaints and grievances, and the LAR implementation schedule, budgets, and monitoring. A summary \nof these aspects of the resettlement plan is provided in the next paragraphs. \n5.  Project Implementation Conditions Related to the Resettlement Plan. This resettlement plan \nis based on surveys carried out in May\u2013September 2007 and June 2008 under the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance. Although the data in this resettlement plan are adequate, final design alignments \nmay require some impact review and confirmation work. To ensure that impact data are updated as \nneeded and guarantee that the affected families are fully compensated and rehabilitated before any \nimpact  occurs,  two  project  implementation  conditions  related  to  the  resettlement  plan  have  been \nestablished: (i) civil works contracts will be approved only after the resettlement plan has been reviewed \nand confirmed or amended on the basis of the final detailed design, and (ii) ADB will approve the \nmobilization  of  contractors  only  after  the  full  implementation  of  the  compensation  and  rehabilitation \nprogram detailed in the resettlement plan. \n6.  Compensation  Principles  and  Entitlements  Provisions.  The  resettlement  plan  lists  the \nfollowing compensation principles: (i) LAR will be avoided or at least minimized; (ii) compensation will \nguarantee at least the maintenance of the affected family\u2019s living standards before the Project; (iii) affected \nfamilies will be fully informed and consulted on compensation options; (iv) affected families\u2019 sociocultural \ninstitutions will be supported and used; (v) LAR provisions will apply equally to women and men; (vi) lack \nof formal title will not be a bar to compensation or rehabilitation; (vii) particular attention will be paid to \nvulnerable groups and households headed by women; (viii) LAR will be conceived and executed as an \nintegral part of the project and LAR budgets will be included in project costs; and (ix) compensation \nwill be fully provided before ground leveling and demolition. The resettlement plan also contains the \nfollowing eligibility and entitlement provisions covering all impact caused by the Project:  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Institutional  Responsibilities. The EA has overall LAR preparation, implementation, and \nfinancing responsibility and will exercise its functions via a PMU with overall project responsibilities. \nSubproject tasks will be carried out by a PIU set up in Surkhandarya Province. LAR regulatory \nfunctions are the standard responsibility of district administrations, and all surveys and compensation \nprovisions will be certified by them. At the PMU, LAR issues will be handled by a resettlement expert, \nwho will work in close association with a resettlement officer from the province. As local capacity in \ninternational  LAR  standards  is  still  based  on  relatively  short  experience  the  local  resettlement \npersonnel  will  be  assisted  by  the  resettlement  team,  comprising  an  international  resettlement \nspecialist and a national social and resettlement expert. \n8.  Disclosure  and  Public  Consultation.  LAR preparation  entails  thorough  consultation.  All \naffected families were informed and consulted on the resettlement plan provisions, both individually \nand in community meetings. As an appraisal condition, the resettlement plans will be posted on the ADB \nwebsite, and disclosed in the local language to the affected families and communities. An information \nbooklet  will  be  sent  to  all  affected  families  to  ensure  that  they  understand  their  rights  and  the \ncompensation due them.  \n9.  Grievance  Procedures.  A  grievance  procedure  has  been  established  as  follows: \n(i) grievances will be handled first at the district level by the local cadastre office; (ii) if no solution is \nreached, the affected families will then lodge a complaint with the provincial administration; and, \nfinally, (iii) if no settlement is reached the affected families will still be able to seek redress in the \nappropriate court.  \n10.  Monitoring and Evaluation. The PMU will monitor LAR implementation internally and report \nto the EA, which will report quarterly to ADB. Since the resettlement plan significantly affects less than \n200 people, no external monitoring will be carried out. \n11.  Finances  and  Schedules.  The  resettlement  plans  will  detail  the  LAR  budget  and \nimplementation schedules, linking LAR tasks with the start of civil works. \nC.  Due Diligence \n12.  In the remaining seven subprojects, no resettlement or structure or land impact will take place \nas construction will only be carried out to replace existing pipes within public rights-of-way. Except for \nminor  disturbances,  these  activities  will  not  have  any  adverse  impact  on  people  or  things. \nDue-diligence reports were prepared for all the seven subprojects to document the absence of LAR \nimpact. These reports include (i) a brief description of the subproject and the work involved, (ii) a \ndiagram  of  the  alignments,  (iii)  an  outline  of  the  LAR  surveys  and  fieldwork,  (iv) a  table  of \nconsultations and dates, and (v) conclusion. \n13.  Upon project implementation, the PMU resettlement expert will (i) review the resettlement plan \nfor  Djarkurgan,  (ii)  review  due  diligence  on  the  remaining  seven  subprojects,  (iii)  prepare  a \nconfirmation letter or a report documenting any modifications in each subproject and submit it to ADB, \nand (iv) receive a no-objection confirmation from ADB for each subproject before any construction \ntakes place in that subproject. \n ", "48  Appendix 13 \n \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \nA.  Physical Components \n1.  The main physical components of the Project will involve the following interventions: (i) the \nrehabilitation of 53.3 kilometers (km) of existing trunk mains and the construction of 24.4 km of new \ntrunk  mains,  (ii)  the  rehabilitation  of  147.95  km  of  existing  distribution  networks  and  the \nconstruction of 107.9 km of new distribution networks at existing water distribution centers (WDCs), \n(iii) the  rehabilitation  of  19  existing  water  reservoirs  and  the  construction  of  eight  new  water \nreservoirs, (iv) the rehabilitation of 47 existing boreholes and the construction of 11 new boreholes, \n(v) the rehabilitation of 44 existing pumping stations and the construction of four new pumping \nstations, (vi) the development of existing sanitation zones around water distribution centers, and \n(vii) the rehabilitation and construction of water treatment facilities (chlorination rooms at WDCs). In \naddition, the Project will rehabilitate toilet facilities in schools. The Project targets a population of \n340,000 in 2014 and 367,000 in 2020. \nB.  Existing Environment  \n1.  Physical Environment \n \n2.  Surkhandarya  River,  the  main  natural  drainage  system  in  Surkhandarya  Province, \noriginates in western Tajikistan, enters the Surkhandarya Province at the northeastern boundary of \nthe province, and discharges into the Amu Darya River. The province has extensive artificial \nirrigation and drainage systems and some associated reservoirs. Part of the groundwater in the \nprovince  is  salinized,  with  total  dissolved  solids  content  often  exceeding  5  grams  per  liter. \nHowever, there are aquifers with variable amounts of freshwater reserves in some of the project \ndistricts in Surkhandarya Province. The quality of the groundwater is generally good. \n2.  Socioeconomic Environment \n3.  The  average  household  size  in  the  project  districts  is  5.9  persons,  and  5  persons  in \nTermez.  A  typical  poor  household  consists  of  6.6  persons.  The  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance socioeconomic survey in 2007\u20132008 showed a household poverty rate of 33% in the \nseven subproject districts and 31% in Termez City. The poverty line in monetary terms is $37 per \nmonth  in  Termez  City  and  $19.4  in  the  subproject  districts.  Only  42%  of  households  in  the \nsubproject districts have access to piped water in their homes, while in Termez City access is \nabout 90%. However, 13% of these connections have never worked, and the rest operate for an \naverage of 8.4 hours per day in the subproject districts and 11.2 hours per day in Termez City. In \nthe summer water supply interruptions are more frequent. Further, 45% of households in the \nsubproject districts use water from open water reservoirs (river, canal) at least sometimes for \nhousehold  needs,  including  more  than  20%  of  households  that  use  river  water  for  drinking. \nConsequently,  there  is  a  high  incidence  of  water-related  diseases.  On  average  the,  annual \nexpenses for diarrhea treatment amount to about 10% of monthly family income per sick child. \nAbout half of households surveyed in the seven subproject districts and nearly 30% of households \nin Termez City do not have a special room designated for bathing, and only 5% of households in \nthe seven project districts have bathrooms connected to water pipelines. About 50% of the adults \nand 30% of the children bathe only once a week. In the rural settlements of the seven subproject \nareas, no households have access to a central sewerage system. Human waste is dumped into \nnon-ventilated pit latrines in domestic gardens. Most of the toilets in the surveyed households are \nnot  equipped  with  leakproof  concrete  lining.  In  general,  only  45%  of  the  130  schools  in  the \nsubproject areas are connected to piped water supply, and only two schools have a centralized \n ", "  Appendix 13  49\n   \nsewerage  system.  Other  social  infrastructure  in  the  project  areas  (kindergartens,  colleges, \nhospitals, clinics) is only slightly better-off.  \n3.  Biological Environment \n4.  Protected nature areas currently cover 4.6% of the country\u2019s territory. However, these areas \nare found in remote areas, far from the project areas. There are two state reserves (protected \nnature areas or wildlife habitats) of national or local importance near or within the perimeter of \nSurkhandarya Province, but only one 20 km from Termez City is near a subproject area. In all \nsubproject areas, irrigated agriculture is intensely developed and does not offer ideal refuge to wild \nanimals. Irrigated croplands are dominated by cotton plantations and winter wheat. Other crops are \npotato,  onion,  tomato,  cucumber,  apple,  grape,  melon,  and  watermelon.  The  wild  flora  of \nnonirrigated lands differs with the relief. In lowlands grow couch grass, motley grass, and pistachio \ntrees; in the mid-mountains, hawthorn and dog rose are typical. The wild fauna is represented by \ncommon species, including rodents, reptiles, insects, and arachnoids. Typically farm livestock is \nfound  in  pasture  land  (Gissar  sheep,  goats).  The  proposed  rehabilitation  and  construction \nsubproject interventions are not expected to have a significant long-term impact on the present \nvegetation and animal world. \n4.  Cultural Environment and Historical Heritage \n5.  The eight subproject areas are located between Dushanbe and Termez. Cultural heritage \nhas marked these historical cities, but few monuments have been reported and these will not be \naffected by the project interventions.  \nC.  Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n1.  Environmental Impact Caused by the Project Location \n6.  The land in the project areas is generally agricultural or non-valuable. The subproject \ninterventions will nearly all be undertaken in or around existing water supply facilities (water \ndistribution  centers,  sanitation  zones)  and  along  existing  water  supply  lines  (main  trunks, \ndistribution system); long-term environmental impact caused by the project location is therefore not \nexpected. The source of water will frequently be tested before the final decision for development. \nThe results of the quality tests must prove that the water is suitable as raw water to be used for \ndrinking. The long-term design yield of each production well added to the yield of other wells \nalready in use must not exceed the aquifer\u2019s sustainable annual recharge.  \n2.  Impact Related to Design \n7.  The  Project  mostly  entails  the  rehabilitation  or  construction  of  groundwater  wells  and \ntransmission channels, and facilities in and around the potable water supply systems. The design \nis based on the extraction of potable groundwater through pumps and its transmission through \ndistribution networks and treatment to water users. In four of the eight subprojects the feasibility \nteam considered alternative designs, and in each case selected the most cost-effective. From an \nenvironmental  point  of  view,  there  were  no  differences  between  the  options  considered.  No \nenvironmental implications are expected from the improvements that will be made in the water \nintake structures. Transmission mains will be laid as much as possible along existing roads. \nTransmission mains, distribution networks, and in-yard connections will be of nonmetallic pressure \npipes, recommended for domestic and drinking water supply, and complying with international \nstandards. Typically these will include high-density polyethylene pipes, and polyvinyl chloride and \ncarbon fiber or cement (Hobbes) pipes. No asbestos cement pipes will be used. Steel pipes will be \n ", "50  Appendix 13 \n \nused only in river and canal crossings. The provision of sealed pit latrines in schools and health \nunits  in  the  villages  covered  by  the  subprojects  will  prevent  leakage  into  groundwater.  The \nconstruction  of  all  sanitation  facilities  at  schools  will  conform  to  the  relevant  Uzbekistan \nconstruction code. Adverse impact due to the project design is therefore not expected. \n3.  Impact during Construction and Mitigation Measures \n8.  Occupation of Agricultural Land. All possible measures will be taken at the design stage \nto avoid encroaching into irrigated and other agricultural lands, private buildings, and houses. \nDetails on required compensation are provided in the separate resettlement plans. Transmission \nmains will be designed along existing roads. Government procedures for compensation will be \ncomplied with. \n \n9.  Increased Traffic. Traffic of heavy trucks transporting construction materials will increase \ntemporarily during the implementation of the subprojects. Measures will be taken to enforce strictly \nsafety rules at main road crossings, along main roads, along the makhalla streets, and near \nrehabilitation sites. Temporary or permanent traffic lights in most sensitive road crossings will be \ninstalled by the contractors, under the supervision of the project implementation unit. Traffic police \ncontrol  will  be  intensified  in  makhallas  during  the  rehabilitation  or  construction  period,  and \nadequate warning will be provided to enhance the safety of schoolchildren. \n \n10.  Use of Machinery. Temporary environmental concerns related to the use of excavators, \ncranes, compressors, and other machinery during construction works will include (i) noise and dust \nfrom construction sites, and (ii) safety of workers and inhabitants. Measures will include (i) avoiding \nwork  with  noisy  equipment  in  settled  areas  at  night;  (ii)  careful  conduct  of  excavation  and \nearthmoving works, and transportation of earth, particularly within settled areas; and (iii) use of \nmasks by operators. \n \n11.  Water Resources. Water intakes will be implemented according to the \u201cauthorization on \nspecial  water  supply\u201d  approved  by  the  State  Committee  for  Nature  Protection,  which  will  be \nlegalized in the next design phase. In most subproject areas there are only irrigation and drainage \ncanals as in-land surface waters. However, measures for the protection of all types of water \nresources from any possible source of contamination should be taken during rehabilitation and \nconstruction  works.  Adequate  waste  management  measures  will  be  implemented  to  prevent \naccidental pollution of water resources. \n \n12.  Soils. Soils could be exposed to contamination by the same sources of pollution as water \nresources (para. 11). Soil protection measures are to be enforced in accordance with government \nconstruction norms and rules. During pipeline construction, organic topsoil that can be further used \nwill be removed and stored temporarily, apart from the remaining removed earth. The organic soil \nwill be placed on top of the backfilling material, compacted, and restored to agricultural use. The \nsetting in place of the infrastructure required for the Project does not conflict with any other type of \nexisting utility infrastructure such as roads, irrigation infrastructure, canals, and bridges, whether \nduring construction or in the long term. \n \n13.  Waste Management. Measures at the construction sites will include the provision of refuse \ncollection containers for solid waste and used-oil collection containers, with further removal to \nspecially allocated disposal and reclamation sites. After the completion of construction works, all \njob sites will be cleaned and landscaped. Sanitation facilities will be constructed at the work sites. \n \n14.  Historical and Cultural Sites and Landscape. There are no historical monuments or \ncultural landmarks reported within or along the alignments in the subproject areas. The location of \nelevated structures, such as storage tanks, will be selected so as to minimize any disruption of the \n ", "  Appendix 13  51\n   \nexisting village architecture and of the surrounding landscape. Most elevated structures will be \nconstructed within existing sanitation zone enclosures. \n4.  Long-Term Impact and Mitigation Measures \n15.  Groundwater  Deposits.  Planned  extraction  from  targeted  groundwater  deposits  is \nsubstantially  higher  than  current  extraction  levels  but  is well  within the  government-approved \nannual  levels  of  extraction  of  these  deposits.  Some  local  groundwater  aquifers  constitute \nsignificant alternative resources for local water supplies in certain subproject areas.  \n \n16.  Wastewater.  A  substantial  increase  in  wastewater  volume  is  expected  in  the  Termez \nsubproject. The existing wastewater treatment plant, covering 50% of the city households, is being \nrenovated and will have a capacity of 12,500 cubic meters (m\u00b3) per day, sufficient to handle current \npeak demands of 11,000 m\u00b3/day. The local government  has started on a feasibility study to \nupgrade the facility with funds expected from Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China to a \ncapacity of 35,000 m\u00b3/day, covering 70%\u201375% of the city households. Significant adverse impact is \nnot expected from wastewater discharge in the Termez subproject area once the capacity increase \nhas  been  implemented.  Wastewater  volumes  produced  in  the  other  seven  subprojects  are \nconsidered \u201cnon-substantial,\u201d and are widely regarded as not being a problem for the following \nreasons: (i) low population density in the subproject areas, (ii) the mostly scattered location of \nhouses, (iii) house owners\u2019 practice of recycling domestic wastewater for gardening, (iv) suitability \nof soil conditions for filtering and absorbing organic substances, (v) the substantial depth (200\u2013400 \nmeters below the surface) of potable groundwater aquifers, (vi) the predominant use of dry pit \nlatrines in these areas, and (vii) the likelihood of a drop in consumption, by as much as 20%, once \nmeters  are  installed.  If  needed,  more  advanced  evacuation  and  treatment  systems  may  be \nimplemented at later stages. \n \n17.  Protection of Water Resources and Water Quality. Water resources will be protected by \na sanitary protection zone (SPZ) to be rehabilitated or constructed according to the construction \nnorms and rules for water supply external nets. SPZs will be rehabilitated or constructed at the \nwater  distribution  centers,  water  intake  structures,  water  conduits,  and  water  transmission \nstructures; most of these already exist. A sanitary protection belt, based on the construction rules \nand norms, will also be established along the alignment of water transmission mains crossing built-\nup areas. The quality of water distributed will be controlled daily by the operators responsible for \nthe operation and maintenance (O&M) of each water supply system and weekly by the provincial \nsanitary  and  epidemiological  services  (SES).  Daily  controls  will  include  determination  of  free \nchlorine, and routine physical-chemical analysis. The results of weekly analyses performed by the \nSES must show compliance with the national drinking water quality standards. \n \n18.  Impact Caused by the Project Infrastructure Operation. Basically, the operation of a \nwater supply system does not imply significant risks. The reconstructed chlorination rooms will be \nequipped  with  modern  technological  equipment,  using  alternative  methods  of  disinfection \n(hypochlorite sodium or chloride), which prevents harmful emissions to the atmosphere. In the \ncylinder  storehouse  and  in  chlorine  dosimeters  two  independent  ventilation  systems  will  be \nprovided,  one  in  constant  operation  and  the  other  on  standby.  Anti-seismic  measures  in \naccordance  with  construction  norms  and  rules  for  construction  in  seismic  districts,  aimed  at \ndecreasing seismic load and increasing resistance to seismic impact, will be provided by the \nProject. The Project envisages anticorrosion measures in accordance with construction norms and \nrules  for  the  protection  of  construction  structural  units  and  structures  from  corrosion  for  the \nmitigation of negative impact on groundwater. Preventive measures intended to protect the health \nof personnel engaged in the operation of the Project, entail strict observance of safety rules, and \nnormative documents on water supply operation. Personnel engaged in water treatment will be \nspecially trained by equipment suppliers. \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \n \n \n19.  Project  Demobilization.  There  will  be  no  decommissioning.  The  electromechanical \ncomponents  will  be  replaced  every  20  years  and  dismantled  parts  will  be  partially  recycled. \nSubstituted  components  of  chlorination  units  will  also  be  dismantled  or  disposed  of  in  safe \nrepositories  for  special  waste,  in  accordance  with  national  regulations.  Existing  water  supply \nsystems that will be rehabilitated or replaced will not be removed from the ground. \nD.  Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n20.  An environmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP) has been prepared and is \nincluded in the initial environmental examination. It distinguishes between mitigation measures (to \nbe performed by the contractors), independent monitoring, and EMMP-related training. A further \ndistinction is made between mitigation and monitoring to be conducted during the construction and \nO&M phases of the water supply infrastructure. All measures (mitigation, monitoring, and training) \nduring the construction will be funded through the project budget; required measures during the \nO&M phase will be paid out of the vodokanal budget. The parameters to be monitored, as well as \nthe frequency of monitoring and reporting, will be tested and adjusted as needed during the \nProject. A summary table of the estimated budget for the implementation of the EMMP is given \nbelow. The budget for the mitigation measures is only indicative. All mitigation measures, and \nrequired budgets, will be reflected in the contractors\u2019 bidding documents and contracts. The total \nbudget for the implementation of the EMMP is $385,000. \n \nTable A13: Costs of Implementing the Environmental Management \nand Monitoring Plan  \nDescription  Amount ($) \nMitigation measures (to be implemented by contractors)  180,000 \nIndependent monitoring  145,000 \nEMMP-related training program  60,000 \n  TOTAL  385,000 \nEMMP= environmental management and monitoring plan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nE.  Institutional Arrangements for Environmental Compliance \n21.  The provincial department of the State Committee for Nature Protection will be responsible \nfor  (i)  environmental  clearance  of  all  physical  infrastructure,  (ii)  monitoring  of  environmental \ncompliance during construction, and (iii) follow-up environmental monitoring. The provincial SES \nwill be in charge of periodic testing of physicochemical and bacteriological content in drinking water \nin the distribution system for compliance with national quality norms. The PIU will be responsible \nfor  implementing  the  EMMP  in  each  subproject.  Local  government  representatives  and \nschoolteachers should be also involved in the implementation of the EMMP. The project budget \nincludes provision for the training of the project management unit (PMU) and PIU personnel in \nenvironmental procedures. To facilitate monitoring, an environmental monitoring group (EMG) will \nbe set up and will be composed of the following: (i) the senior environment specialist\u2013cum\u2013group \nleader, (ii) the environment expert, and (iii) a representative of the provincial administration. The \nEMG members will be national experts. A report on the environment and the implementation of the \nEMMP will be prepared and sent by the Borrower to the ADB every 6 months during project \nimplementation. \nF.  Public Consultations and Information Disclosure \n22.  Consultations have been conducted with the responsible national and provincial institutions, \ndistrict  administrations,  and  other  interested  parties  in  Surkhandarya  Province.  A  stakeholder \n ", "  Appendix 13  53\n   \nseminar was organized in Termez on 10 July 2007; there were 61 participants, including provincial \nand district authorities, technical vodokanal staff, representatives of rural assemblies, and women\u2019s \ngroups. The main technical project interventions and their main environmental and social impact \nwere explained to participants, who were invited to respond, express their opinions, and provide \ninput on (i) technical solutions and the scope of work, (ii) the current state of the environment in the \nproject  areas,  (iii)  environmentally  related  social  and  resettlement  issues,  and  (iv)  planned \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  during  rehabilitation  or  construction  and  operation.  The \ndiscussions and comments provided essential background, particularly with regard to overcoming \ngroundwater contamination and other negative impact. Subsequently, close focus meetings and \ndiscussions  with  local  stakeholders  particularly  makhalla  associations,  public  and  women\u2019s \nsocieties and nongovernment organizations, and district administration representatives were held \nin the course of social, resettlement, and environmental studies. The concerns expressed were \nrelated  mainly  to  land  occupation,  wastewater,  scope  of  work,  and  the  planned  schedule  of \ntechnical interventions. There was general consensus that continuous availability of drinking water \nwould be a substantially positive improvement for health and sanitation. A second stakeholder \nseminar in Termez was conducted in July 2008. The EMMP budget includes an allocation for \nstakeholder meetings during construction. \nG.  Conclusions and Recommendations \n23.  The Project is aimed at improving the health of people\u2014340,000 in all by 2014\u2014who now \nsuffer from lack of water supply and adequate sanitation facilities. Negative impact is limited in \nextent, can be prevented by implementing the EMMP, and can eventually be easily mitigated. \nFurther study into adequate solutions for the increased wastewater volumes that will result from the \nProject is recommended. The development schemes adopted represent the least-cost solutions as \nwell as the most environmentally compatible alternatives. The Project is a necessary step toward \nimproving the economic development and poverty alleviation prospects of the province. Failure to \nimplement the Project would lead to deterioration of health, increase in poverty, and increase in \nemigration\u2014particularly among young people in search of better living opportunities in cities or \nabroad.  There  is  a  well-structured  environmental  institutional  framework  at  the  central  and \nprovincial levels. Procedures for the examination of environmental compliance are well in place \nand tested. The legal basis is exhaustive and substantially covers the various environmental \nsectors. Threats to human health will be practically negligible during construction and in the long \nterm. The proposed EMMP should be implemented and revised promptly when needed. \n ", "54  Appendix 14 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction and Methodology \n1.  The  economic  analysis  covers  the  Project  as  a  whole,  as  well  as  each  individual \nsubproject, and will be undertaken according to Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines, \nincluding the guidelines and handbook for the economic analysis of projects, particularly those \nin  the  water  supply  sector.1 For  the  overall  project,  the  analysis  describes  the  economic \nrationale, the rationale for public intervention, and the setting of the without-project situation. \nThe analysis assumes that without the Project, the existing systems\u2019 supply capacity will remain \nthe same as in 2008. The economic analysis also evaluates the cost-effectiveness of individual \nsubprojects,  focusing  on  the  least-cost  analysis.  The  subproject  analysis  compares  the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) with the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC), \nassumed  at  12%  as  applied  in  infrastructure  project  studies  undertaken  in  Uzbekistan. \nSensitivity and risk analyses are undertaken to assess the robustness of the subproject under \nadverse  economic  conditions.  The  analysis  uses  shadow  pricing  and  standard  conversion \nfactors  to  convert  the  financial  cost  and  benefits  into  economic  terms.  The  analysis  is \nundertaken in constant May 2008 prices. Details of the economic analysis are presented in \nSupplementary Appendix J. \nB.  Economic Rationale \n2.  The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought about the sudden stoppage of funding \nand  subsidies  to  the water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  sector  in Uzbekistan.  Uzbekistan \ninherited an enormous number of WSS systems (mostly overdesigned) that are reaching the \nend of their useful life. The amount of the capital investment required to rehabilitate or upgrade \nthe systems cannot be met solely by the national and local budgets;2 as a result, the water \nsupply system in the country is faced with further deterioration. To arrest the continued decline \nof  water  supply  services,  the  Government  has  begun  a  number  of  key  reforms  including \n(i) improvements in water sector services through a national water supply development plan; \n(ii) financial sustainability goals through cost recovery; (iii) adequate investment planning with \ndomestic and external funding; (iv) further decentralization of WSS services; (v) private sector \nparticipation  and  public-private  partnerships  in  the  sector;  (vi) the  conservation  of  water \nresources, the economic use of water, consistent water quality control, and sound management \nof  wastewater;  and  (vii)  improvements  in  operational  strategies  through  a  stronger  sector \ninstitutional set-up and interagency collaboration, and adequate capacity building. \n \n3.  Government  intervention  derives  its  rationale  from  the  increasing  concern  over  the \nworsening water supply situation in Surkhandarya Province, where low and declining coverage \nis being made worse by the slow pace of development in the sector. Water supply systems are \nowned and managed by the vodokanals. However, studies show that where such centralized \nsystems exist, services only continue to worsen because the vodokanals, lacking funds and \ncapacigty, can do very little to improve and rehabilitate the systems. Low tariffs plus significant \nwater losses in the systems result in very limited revenue generation, which, in many cases, \ncannot even cover the required operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The private sector in \nthe  water  supply  sector  is  still  not  developed.  Consequently,  large-scale  system  repair  or \nextension works can be financed only with government support. Despite government efforts to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila; ADB. 1999. Handbook for the Economic \nAnalysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila. \n2  The World Bank estimates that $1.4 billion is needed to replace or rehabilitate existing infrastructure. \n ", "  Appendix 14  55\n   \nrehabilitate WSS systems in the selected districts, access to water supply is inadequate3 even \nin  district  centers.  The  supply  shortage  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  health  of  the \npopulation, particularly the poor, who are the most affected, as recent studies have confirmed.4 \nThe water supply systems are in various stages of deterioration and are only partially functional. \nWithout urgent major investments in supply and distribution networks, water supply systems will \ncontinue to deteriorate rapidly, with serious economic and environmental consequences. \n \n4.   Government involvement is justified because of the significant positive externalities \nassociated with water supply and sanitation services and their natural monopoly conditions. \nMoreover, there is significant scope for the improvement of water supply and sanitation services \nin  Uzbekistan  through  the  provision  of  financial  and  technical  support  and  institutional \nstrengthening, which at present can be provided effectively only by the Government. \nC.  Demand Analysis \n5.  Water demand in the subproject areas has been constrained by the deterioration of the \npiped water systems and their limited capacity to supply consumers. Actual consumption is \ndifficult to ascertain from the vodokanals\u2019 records, since only a few consumers are metered. The \nsocioeconomic survey5 revealed that water supply from the vodokanals averages 13.3 liters per \ncapita per day (lpcd) in Termez City and 12.5 lpcd in the seven other subproject areas. \n \n6.  The low water supply from the vodokanals is augmented by other water supply sources \nthat include water vendors, reservoirs, wells, canals, and rivers. Average consumption from \nthese additional sources is about 11.3 lpcd. \n \n7.  The population in the service area is projected to grow by 1.11% yearly from 2008 to \n2010, and by 1.23% from 2011 onward. Service coverage is projected to increase gradually \nfrom the current level to about 95% by 2020. Projected average water demand per capita is \n100 lpcd, with adjustments for institutional, commercial, and industrial use for each subproject. \nThis  figure  is  based  on  the  standard  adopted  by  the  Government.  While  metering  the \nconsumption and increasing tariffs will result in a lower consumption rate, the increased income \nwill  offset  the  reduction  in  consumption  rate.  Given  this  per  capita  demand,  the  designed \ncapacity is projected to meet water demand up to 2020. From 2021 and onward, it is assumed \nthat water supply will remain at the 2020 level. \nD.  Least-Cost Analysis \n8.  Technical  alternatives  for  four  subprojects6\u2014components  considered  essential  in  a \nsustainable  water  supply  system\u2014were  analyzed.  The  choice  of  options  was  based  on \n(i) technical and physical feasibility; (ii) unit supply costs, given the incremental investment and \nO&M costs; and (iii) sustainability of the available water resource. The least-cost solutions were \nchosen for the project design and the cost-benefit analysis.  \n                                                 \n3 Service coverage levels remain relatively low even after programmed intervention in the past 10 years via the \nnational water supply development plan. Studies show that, as of 2006, network coverage in Surkhandarya was \nabout 76%. Where it exists, water service is available 6\u201316 hours per day in urban areas and 2\u201310 hours in rural \nareas. The rest of the population obtains water from wells and irrigation canals, which are mostly distant, saline, \nand contaminated. \n4 The social survey revealed that there are 10 times more cases of stomach ailments among users of alternative \nsources, especially irrigation canals. \n5  Undertaken during the project design in May 2007 and May 2008. \n6  For the other subprojects, only one technical option was available. \n ", "56  Appendix 14 \nE.  Economic Costs \n9.  Economic costs exclude taxes and duties. Financial prices were converted to economic \nprices through the use of conversion factors. The shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) was \nassumed to be 1.0. The conversion factor for skilled and unskilled labor was assumed to be 1.0, \nand the shadow wage rate factor (SWRF), 0.8.  \nF.  Economic Benefits \n10.  The major economic benefits of improved water supply services are (i) non-incremental \nwater consumption, valued at the average economic supply price7 of water from non-piped \nsources; and (ii) incremental water consumption, valued at the price consumers are willing to \npay8 for the improved water supply services. Benefits that are been deemed difficult to quantify, \nincluding health benefits from avoided medical costs and fire protection, are recognized but \nwere excluded from the analysis.  \nG.  Results of Economic Analysis  \n11  The EIRR was used to measure the economic effectiveness of the Project. A project with \nan EIRR greater than its EOCC would be considered economically viable. The Project was \nfurther tested for economic viability under less favorable or even adverse economic conditions. \nFour hypothetical scenarios were formulated to simulate such conditions in the analysis: (i) a \n20% increase in capital cost, (ii) a 20% increase in operating costs, (iii) a 20% decrease in \nrevenue, and (iv) a 1-year delay in subproject implementation. \n \n12.  For the eight subprojects, EIRR was calculated to be between 24.4% and 39.7%, with an \naverage of 32.1%. Subjected to the sensitivity tests, the subprojects were also found to be \nrobust and economically viable. The calculated EIRR is expected to be lower than the true EIRR \nsince the economic, social, and environmental implications of not undertaking the subprojects \nare not desirable and can worsen poverty in the project areas. \n                                                 \n7  Includes costs of collecting, storing, and treating of water. The average cost is estimated at SUM76,000 per \nhousehold per year, according to the survey. \n8  TAHLIL Center for Social Research. 2007. Socioeconomic and Ability-To-Pay Survey.

The Surkhandarya Water Supply and Sanitation Project will cover seven districts and \nTermez City in Surkhandarya Province. The seven districts are Angor, Djarkurgan, Kizirik, \nKumkurgan,  Muzrabad,  Sariasiya,  and  Shurchi.  Angor  and  Kizirik  districts  are  under  the \nmanagement  of  the  Khodjaipak  Regional  Trunk  Main  Operation  and  Management \nAdministration. In Djarkurgan district, two vodokanals (water supply agencies) will be covered\u2014\nDjarkurgan vodokanal, which serves the district center; and Surkhan vodokanal, which serves \nthe nearby settlements. Capital investments will focus on the rehabilitation of existing water \nsupply systems and expansion to settlements near the district centers. \n \n2.  The financial analysis of the water supply component was undertaken in two parts: \n(i) determination of appropriate water tariffs for each subproject that would ensure financial \nsustainability, and (ii) preparation of financial projections for each subproject. The projections \nconsisted of annual financial statements (income statement, cash flow statement, and balance \nsheet), key performance indicators, and operating and financial data for 2009\u20132020. Details of the \nfinancial analysis are presented in Supplementary Appendix K. \nB.  Bases for Financial Projections \n3.  Price. The financial projections for each subproject are presented on a current price \nbasis. Revenues and costs were converted from constant 2008 prices to current prices through \nthe use of projected local annual inflation rates as follows: 10.5% in 2009, 10% in 2010, 9% in \n2011 to 2012, 5% in 2013, and 4% from 2014 onward. 1 \n \n4.  Financial Objectives. The proposed tariff rates for each subproject were designed to \n(i) fully recover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, (ii) recover all subproject debt service, \n(iii) maintain a debt service ratio of at least 1.2, and (iv) generate a financial internal rate of \nreturn  (FIRR)  greater  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  the  Project, \nwherever  feasible,  after  project  completion.  In  addition,  each  subproject  was  projected  to \nmaintain its accounts receivable at less than 60 days\u2019 equivalent of annual sales by 2016. \n \n5.  Operating Revenues. Operating revenues include water sales and repayment of water \nmeters. Repayment of water meter was assumed to be made in 36 equal monthly installments \nand billed to consumers accordingly. Future water sales were calculated on the basis of water \ndemand (Appendix 12) and projected water tariff levels. Tariffs were set in accordance with the \ngovernment policy, i.e., a maximum of 20% per increase, a maximum of two tariff increases per \nyear, and a maximum profit of 10%.2  \n \n6.  Operating Expenses. Annual O&M costs were projected separately for each subproject \nover  the  entire  forecast  period  by  major  expense  item  (salary,  electricity,  chemicals, \nmaintenance, social charges, selling and administration expenses). Depreciation allowance was \ncalculated on an average asset life of 20 years using the straight-line method. Income tax was \nassumed to be 10%. \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2008. Global Development Finance 2008: The Role of International Banking.

Subproject capital costs will be funded through \nan ADB loan and from government funds. The ADB loan will have a term of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% yearly during the grace period and 1.5% \nyearly thereafter. The Government will relend the proceeds of the loan to UCSA under a \nsubsidiary loan agreement. The relending will be done on ADB loan terms with an additional \ncharge of not more than 0.2% on the ADB interest rate (1.2% during the grace period and 1.7% \nyearly thereafter). UCSA will onlend the proceeds of the subsidiary loan to the subproject \nvodokanals through the Surkhandarya provincial government on the same terms. The provincial \ngovernment will bear the foreign exchange risks.  \nC.  Financial Projections \n8.  Tariff. The existing average tariff (household) in the vodokanals covered by the Project \nis only SUM43 per cubic meter (m3) as of May 2008. For the eight vodokanals, the household \ntariff ranges from SUM28 per m3 to SUM67 per m3. For financial sustainability, the average tariff \nrequired after project completion is projected to range from SUM54 per m3 to SUM369 per m3 \nfrom 2015 to 2020.3 Table A13.1 shows the projected tariff levels for household consumers at \nconstant 2008 prices. The existing tariff structure was followed during the projection period. \nThese tariffs were based on the financial objectives enumerated in para. 4 above and took into \naccount the affordability of the tariffs to the households in the low-income group. \n \nProjected Tariff Requirements and Affordability a \n(in constant 2008 prices) \n \nItem  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020 \nTermez             \nTariff (SUM per m3)  112  127  134  142  150  159 \nAffordability             \n  Low Income (%)  0.9  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.5  1.6 \n  Average Income (%)  1.0  1.1  1.3  1.4  1.5  1.7 \nDjarkurgan             \nTariff (SUM per m3)  54  63  72  82  87  92 \nAffordability             \n  Low Income (%)  0.5  0.6  0.8  0.9  0.9  1.0 \n  Average Income (%)  0.4  0.4  0.5  0.6  0.6  0.7 \nKhojaipak             \nTariff (SUM per m3)  175  176  178  180  181  183 \nAffordability             \n  Low Income (%)  1.8  1.8  1.8  1.9  1.9  1.9 \n  Average Income (%)  1.6  1.6  1.7  1.7  1.7  1.8 \nKumkurgan             \nTariff (SUM per m3)  102  112  121  128  135  143 \nAffordability             \n  Low Income (%)  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4  1.5  1.6 \n  Average Income (%)  1.0  1.2  1.3  1.4  1.4  1.5 \n                                                 \n3  In constant May 2008 prices. \n ", "  Appendix 15  59\n   \nItem  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020 \nMuzrabad             \nTariff (SUM per m3)  159  198  238  286  331  369 \nAffordability             \n  Low Income (%)  1.5  1.8  2.2  2.7  3.2  3.6 \n  Average Income (%)  1.5  1.9  2.3  2.8  3.2  3.6 \n             \nSariasiya             \nTariff (SUM per m3)  80  88  97  105  111  117 \nAffordability             \n  Low Income (%)  0.8  0.8  0.9  1.0  1.1  1.2 \n  Average Income (%)  0.8  0.9  1.0  1.1  1.1  1.2 \nShurchi             \nTariff (SUM per m3)  81  86  91  92  92  93 \nAffordability             \n  Low Income (%)  0.7  0.8  0.9  0.9  0.9  0.9 \n  Average Income (%)  0.6  0.7  0.7  0.7  0.7  0.8 \nSurkhan             \nTariff (SUM per m3)  164  197  227  262  278  294 \nAffordability             \n  Low Income (%)  1.6  2.0  2.4  2.8  3.0  3.2 \n  Average Income (%)  1.1  1.3  1.6  1.9  2.0  2.2 \na  Includes payment for water meters in 36 equal monthly installments. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n9.  Affordability.  An  affordability  analysis  was  undertaken  to  ensure  that  household \nconsumers, particularly those in the low-income group, can afford the proposed water tariffs. On \nthe  generally  accepted  principle  that  the  expenditure  on  water  should  not  exceed  4%  of \nhousehold income, the projected water tariffs are considered affordable. The table above shows \nthe ratio of the monthly bills to the monthly household income for the low-income group and the \naverage-income group. The monthly bills include payment for the water meters in 36 equal \nmonthly installments. \n \n10.  WACC and FIRR. The opportunity cost of the government funds is assumed at 25%, \nincluding a risk premium. At a funding ratio of 79:21 between ADB and the Government, WACC \nis about 4.2% in constant May 2008 prices. The FIRRs are estimated to range from 5.1% to \n5.8%, with an average of 5.4% for the Project. All FIRRs are higher than the WACC. Sensitivity \nanalysis also showed that under the assumed adverse conditions, all eight subprojects would \nstill be financially viable. In addition, the proposed tariff rate increases would generate enough \nrevenues to recover full O&M costs from 2013 onward. By 2015, annual revenues for all the \nsubproject vodokanals are projected to cover all O&M costs and debt service obligations, and a \ndebt service ratio of at least 1.2:1 will be maintained. \nD.  Financial Performance of Vodokanals \n11.  Recent  Financial  Performance.  The  last  3  years  of  operation  of  the  subproject \nvodokanals showed a positive net income except for Khodjaipak vodokanal.4 From 2005 to \n                                                 \n4  This income result was achieved by stinting on O&M, a practice that jeopardizes the system in the long run. \n ", "60  Appendix 15 \n2007, Surkhan5 vodokanal registered a net income of 2%\u20133% of total revenue, while the other \nsubproject vodokanals registered a net income of less than 1% of total revenue.  \n \n12.  Projected  Financial  Performance.  Net  income  is  projected  to  be  positive  for  all \nsubprojects from 2017 onward and net cash flow to be positive for all subprojects by 2015, the \nyear after the project facilities are put into operation. The negative net income in the beginning \nyears for some subprojects is due mainly to the time needed to expand the connections and \ngradually  increase  tariffs.  The  difference  between  the  net  cash  flow  and  net  income \nperformance is mainly due to the of time difference between the collection of depreciation \nallowance and the repayment of the loan: interest payments will start in 2015 and principal \nrepayment will start in 2017. \n \n13.  Termez vodokanal is projected to post a positive return on net fixed assets (ROA) of \n2.4%\u201316.3% from 2016 to 2020. Debt service ratio (DSR) will be greater than 1.2 during the \nprojection period. Djarkurgan vodokanal is projected to register a net income by 2018, while \nROA will range from 2.6% to 11.7% from 2017 to 2020. DSR will be greater than 1.2 during the \nprojection period. Khodjaipak is projected to show a positive financial performance after project \ncompletion. The financial projections assumed that the other districts served by Khodjaipak6 \nwould implement tariff increases to cover annual increase in total O&M costs. DSR would range \nfrom 4.1 to 18.3, while ROA would range from 8.2% to 34.7%. \n \n14.  Kumkurgan vodokanal is projected to post a net income by 2017 and ROA of 1.1%\u2013\n16.3% from 2016 to 2020. DSR will be greater than 1.2 during the projection period. Muzrabad \nvodokanal will generate net income only from 2017 onward, mainly because of higher per capita \ninvestment, although net cash flow will be positive from 2015 to 2020. DSR will be greater than \n1.2 during the projection period. Sariasiya vodokanal will have a positive net income by 2018 \nand a positive net cash flow by 2015. ROA is projected to range from 1.1% to 12.4% from 2016 \nto 2020. DSR will range from 1.7 to 6.6 after project completion.  \n \n15.  Shurchi vodokanal is projected to register a net income by 2014 and a positive net cash \nflow by 2015. ROA will range from 6.4% to 29.5% from 2015 to 2020. DSR will be greater than \n1.2 during the projection period. Surkhan vodokanal will generate net income starting in 2016 \nand a positive net cash flow from 2015 to 2020. The vodokanal will have DSRs greater than 1.2 \nduring the projection period. \n                                                 \n5  Surkhan vodokanal is involved in water supply construction. In 2007, the revenue from the construction business \nwas 65% of the vodokanal\u2019s total revenues. \n6  Khodjaipak vodokanal covers seven districts, including Angor and Kizirik. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081010141227+08'00'", "Author": "GULEN ATAY", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0.5 for Word", "Keywords": "surkhandarya water supply, surkhandarya provincial government, uzbekistan communal services agency, water supply and sanitation, water financing partnership facility, national water supply devt program, adb project 40007", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081105145549+08'00'", "Title": "Surkhandarya Water Supply and Sanitation Project"}, "author_page": " \n \nVice-President  X.
