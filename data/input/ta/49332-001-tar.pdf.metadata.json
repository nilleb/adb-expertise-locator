INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In 2015, the Government of the Lao PDR, through Department of Skills Management \nand  Employment,  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Welfare  (MLSW),  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide a capacity development technical assistance (TA) to help \nstrengthen the employment service system (ESS) by giving graduate job seekers with inclusive \naccess to employment information. The proposed TA project is aligned with the priorities of the \ncountry\u2019s Eighth National Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016\u201320201, and is included in \nthe  country  operations  and  business  plan  for  2016\u20132018.2 The  Embassy  of  Japan  was \nconsulted on 14 July 2015, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency on 24 July 2015.3 \nThe  TA  fact\u2013finding  mission  took  place  on  9\u201317  November  2015  and  agreements  were \nsubsequently reached with the government on the design of the project, including its impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost estimates and financing arrangements, \nand consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The economy of the Lao PDR, which has grown at an average rate of 7.4% since 2007, \nrelies mainly on resources, especially hydropower and mining, which generate few jobs for the \ngeneral labor force. Paid employment is concentrated in the formal sector and to some extent \nthe informal sector, mostly in nascent manufacturing, agribusiness and agro-processing, and \nservices. These jobs are located primarily in major cities and town centers, and recruitment \nopportunities are often not publicized to the general labor force residing in small towns and rural \nareas.  The  formal  sector  currently  employs  only  29%  of  the  total  workforce;  70%  of  the \nworkforce is employed in agriculture, but these employees are mainly unpaid as they are  \nsubsistence farmers. This situation keeps the country\u2019s strong economic growth from spilling \nover to the general population, thus limiting income generation and thwarting poverty reduction \nefforts. A 2014 study by the World Bank found a high demand for skilled workers in the formal \nsector  and  forecasted  that  96,000  new  jobs  in  services,  tourism  and  hospitality,  building \nconstruction, high value agriculture, hydropower and will be created annually for the next 15 \nyears. However, due to a lack of access to reliable employment information and skill, paid jobs \nreceive very few applicants.4  \n \n3.  The Lao PDR has significantly increased access to secondary and tertiary education, \nwhich accounts for more than 800,000 students or 47% of the total population aged 15\u201325 \nyears old. ADB has provided assistance to the government to improve secondary education, \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET), and higher education. Development \npartner assistance in tertiary education, particularly TVET, is well coordinated to ensure that the \nskills  provided  respond  to  labor  market  demand.5 Currently,  of  the  approximately  120,000 \ngraduates (70,000 secondary school, 35,000 TVET, and 15,000 university graduates) that look \n                                                \n1  Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2016. Eight National Socio-Economic Development Plan. Vientiane \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 October 2015. \n3  Meetings were held with Mr. Asada Yoshinori, Research Adviser on Economic and Social Development, Embassy \nof Japan and with Ms. Ohki Fuyuko, Representative from the Japan International Cooperation Agency in the Lao \nPDR. The Lao National Chamber of Commerce and Trade Associations and Vocational Training Institutes were \nconsulted during the preparation of the TA concept note. \n4   World Bank. 2014.

The  Lao  PDR  needs  to  develop  an  employment  service  plan  (ESP)  to  guide \nestablishment of ESS and identify public and private resources needed for ESS implementation.  \nESP aims to (i) improve employment service channels and provide action plan, budget and \nmonitoring  mechanism,  (ii)  develop  ESS  for  public  access  to  employment  information,  (iii) \nstrengthen  institutional  capacity  of  MLSW  and  job  centers  to  deliver  quality  employment \nservices, and (iv) upgrade existing labor market information system (LMIS) to forecast labor \nmarket  demand  and  supply  more  accurately.  ESS  will  help  connect  job  seekers  with \nemployment opportunities and facilitate skills matching between business employers and job \nseekers.  ESS  includes  information  on  job  titles,  employer  names,  locations,  skill  training \nprograms, and salaries across the country.  \n \n5.  Employer surveys reveal that most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) cannot \nafford to use media to advertise job opportunities.7 Only foreign and large local companies can \nafford the high costs associated with advertisement through print media. Job fairs have become \nthe most popular channel to match employers and job seekers in urban and peri-urban areas; \nhowever, these fairs are organized infrequently and in large towns only. The proposed online \nESS would be the most applicable and effective way to disseminate information more widely to \nprospective applicants and would solve the problem of limited access to printed information on \nemployment opportunities in many locations. Mobile network short message services (SMS) \nand  internet  connections  are  universally  available  at  low  costs  to  the  general  population, \nincluding small towns and rural areas. The current mobile penetration rate is 79.4% and internet \npenetration rate is 17.6%. Due to the high cost of advertising in printed media, which is a heavy \nburden for most local firms and SMEs, the more affordable proposed online ESS is preferred. \n \n6.  The MLSW has established nine job centers in eight provinces and an employer service \ncenter in Vientiane Capital aimed at providing employment information to job seekers and \nmatching employers and job seekers.8 In practice, however, it is difficult for the centers to \nprovide employment services because they lack (i) appropriate equipment to support their \noperation, (ii) updated information on employment opportunities due to weak coordination with \nprivate employers in the provinces, (iii) detailed information on training courses to be provided to \nsecondary  school  graduates  due  to  poor  coordination  with  training  institutes,  (iv)  reliable \ninformation on the skilled labor demanded by employers, (v) experience in job and career \ncounseling for secondary school graduates and older job seekers, and (vi) sufficient resources \nto reach job seekers in rural areas. \n \n7.  The International Labour Organization (ILO) has provided software assistance to the \nMLSW by (i) establishing nine job centers that aim to provide employment information to job \nseekers, and (ii) supporting training courses on employment services and labor force surveys \nfor job center staff.9 However, the job centers are not functioning due to a lack of equipment and \n                                                \n6  Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Education and Sports. 2014.

Although the ILO\u2019s project ended on 31 March 2016, it continues supporting the \nMLSW on updating labor force information, training the nine job center staff on coordination with \nemployers,  and  participating  in  development  of  ESP.10 The  TA  will  build  on  ILO  training \ninitiatives  by  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  MLSW,  provincial  labor  and  social  welfare \ndepartments (PLSWD), and job centers to manage the ESS, coordinate with private enterprises, \nand  provide  employment  services  to  reach  isolated  communities.  Lessons  from  previous \nemployment service programs financed by ADB indicate that successful employment service \nprograms  and  projects  focus  on  employment  policy  and  plans,  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment,  job  search  assistance,  career  guidance  services,  job  fairs,  labor  market \ninformation  systems,  and  updated  skills  training  programs.  Interlinking  these  services  and \nsystems and working with the private sector to assess job requirements and vacancies are other \nimportant success factors.11 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be an increased share of employment in the formal sector, \nwhich is aligned with the Eighth National Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2016\u20132020. \nThe outcome of the TA will be a developed ESS to expand access to employment opportunities \nin the formal sector.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) an ESP developed; (ii) the ESS made operational; \nand (iii) institutional capacity to sustain the ESS and LMIS strengthened. \n \n10.  Output 1: Employment service plan developed. The TA will help the MLSW develop \nan ESP that enhances links and the flow of information between job seekers and employers to (i) \nimprove labor market efficiency, (ii) respond to the demand for labor in the private sector, and (iii) \nincrease employment in the formal sector. The TA will (i) review past and current initiatives in \nthe region related to the provision of employment services, and identify successful approaches; \n(ii)  support  workshops  and  meetings  among  stakeholders  to  identify  collectively  current \nemployment challenges and agree on approaches to tackle them;12 and (iii) prepare an ESP to \nguide the development of the ESS in close coordination with key stakeholders to ensure its \nrelevance and flexible implementation within the local context.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Employment service system made operational. After preparing the ESP, \nthe TA will help the MLSW implement the plan by (i) developing an online ESS under the MLSW \nto expand opportunities for job seekers to access employment information through their mobile \nphones or computers; (ii) developing a mobile network application or SMS to disseminate \nemployment opportunities to job seekers, particularly rural job seekers who own mobile phones; \n(iii)  improving  the  nine existing  job  centers  and  employment  service  center  to  offer  better \n                                                \n10   Meetings held with the ILO regional team in May 2015 and the ILO coordinator in the Lao PDR in November \n2015. \n11 ADB. 2013.

Output 3: Institutional capacity to sustain the ESS and LMIS strengthened. To \nensure that the ESS will be successfully operationalized and maintained, the TA will strengthen \nthe institutional and staff capacity of the MLSW, PLSWD, and job centers. The TA will (i) assess \nthe capacity of the MLSW, PLSWD, and job centers to deliver employment services, implement \nthe LMIS, carry out labor surveys, and manage the job center facilities; (ii) develop training \nprograms  based  on  the  assessment\u2019s  findings  and  recommendations;  (iii)  deliver  training \nprograms to strengthen the institutional capacity of the MLSW, PLSWD, and job centers; (iv) \nhelp the MLSW, PLSWD, and job centers coordinate more effectively with private employers by \nproviding  detailed  information  about  job  opportunities  to  job  seekers;  and  (v)  develop  a \nmonitoring and evaluation system to track employment rates, labor supply rates, and project \nactivities. \n \n13.  The TA will help the MLSW design a system to generate revenues to support the \noperating and maintenance costs of the online ESS, LMIS, and job centers by charging private \nenterprises to advertise job vacancies. Advertising rates will be discussed and agreed upon \nduring the stakeholder meetings to ensure that SMEs can afford them. These revenues will also \nbe used to maintain equipment and partially support outreach services provided by job center \nstaff.   \n \n14.  Risks. As the development of the ESP is an urgent need, government ownership of the \nTA is very strong. Risks and challenges include those related to the unwillingness of private \nenterprises to participate in the ESS implementation and high turnover of government staff at \nministry  and  provincial  levels. The TA  will  mitigate these  risks  by  engaging  existing trade \nassociations and the National Chamber of Commerce in developing the ESP and implementing \nthe ESS. The TA will  also help the MLSW introduce measures to reduce the turnover of \ngovernment staff, particularly at provincial offices and job centers.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,650,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart contributions in the form of counterpart staff, work space for consultants and \nADB staff during missions, administrative support, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n13 Eight  job  centers  in  eight  provinces  including  Borikhamxay,  Champasack,  Khammoune,  Luanprabang, \nSavannakhet, Saravane, Sekong, and Xayabury; and one job center and one employment service center in \nVientiane Capital. \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The MLSW will be the executing agency and the Department of Skills Development and \nEmployment will be the implementing agency. The TA will be implemented from 1 June 2016 to \n31 May 2018. To support implementation and replication, the MLSW will establish a TA advisory \ncommittee, including representatives from the Ministry of Education and Sports, the National \nChamber of Commerce, public and private training institutes, the National Training Council, and \nindustry representatives.14 The substantive role of the Department of Skills Development and \nEmployment as the implementing agency is to coordinate between the private sector and job \nseekers in consultation with the consulting firm. The MLSW will be responsible for organizing \ncapacity-building activities and staffing job centers sufficiently. \n \n17.  The TA  will  provide  38  person-months  of  intermittent  international  consultants  (four \npositions)  and  60  person-months  of  national  consultants  (four  positions)  with  expertise  in \nrelevant  areas  of  employment  development  and  labor  management.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference is in Appendix 3. ADB will recruit a consulting firm using quality- and cost-based \nselection (90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio). A biodata technical proposal is the most appropriate method \nas the TA does not require sophisticated technical support. Consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). To augment the consultants\u2019 inputs, ADB may mobilize additional resource persons as \nneeded, in accordance with ADB procedures.15 ADB will procure equipment to support the \nimplementation  of the ESS  and  LMIS  using  a  national  competitive  bidding method  (to  be \nreviewed by ADB) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time).16 The procurement consists of two packages: (i) $107,000 for the procurement of \nequipment, and (ii) $93,000 for the procurement and operation and maintenance of internet \nconnection services.  \n \n18.  To facilitate the implementation of training, workshops, conferences, and surveys, an \nadvance payment facility will be established for the MLSW in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended from  time  to  time).17 The TA  will \nfinance local costs for civil servants to attend in-country training, workshops, conferences, \nstudies, and surveys as summarized in Supplementary Appendix C.18  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Strengthening Capacity to Develop the Employment \nService System, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14Representatives  of  trade  working  groups,  such  as  construction,  garment,  furniture,  hotel,  and  restaurant \nassociations, among others. \n15 Resource persons can be engaged to act as facilitators, speakers, and panelists in workshops, seminars, and job \nfairs. The engagement of these resource persons will not exceed 10 days. \n16 The equipment will be handed over to the government upon TA completion. \n17 The ADB team will provide in-depth orientation on ADB guidelines during the TA implementation. \n18 The total local cost of $213,000 was indicated in the final technical assistance summary and report approved by the \nGovernment of Japan on 4 September 2015. \n ", "6       Appendix 1 \n \n \n DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned With: \nShare of employment in the formal sector increased (Eighth National Socio-Economic Development Plan \nfor 2016\u20132020)  \n  Data Sources and \nPerformance Targets with Indicators and  Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2019     \n \nESS developed to  a.
