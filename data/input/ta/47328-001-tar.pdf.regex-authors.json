The Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) was established in 2006 by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  through  its  Office  of  Regional  Economic  Integration  (OREI)  to \n(i) provide access to timely and relevant knowledge and information on regional cooperation and \nintegration (RCI), (ii) assist regional economic monitoring and policy dialogue, and (iii) support \nresearch on RCI.1 Since then, ARIC has helped increase the capacity of key stakeholders in the \nregion  to  respond  to  regional  challenges.  Initially,  ARIC  stands  for  the  Asia  Recovery \nInformation  Center,  which  was  established  after  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis  to  provide \nreliable,  timely,  and  accurate  crisis-related  information  to  restore  confidence  and  support \neconomic recovery in the region. Later, in March 2004, it was renamed the Asia Regional \nInformation Center, providing information on recovery efforts in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand; and later extended to cover the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Singapore, and Viet Nam. In 2006, the newly renamed Asia Regional Integration Center \nwas given a new mandate to serve as a one-stop, web-based knowledge and information portal \non the progress of RCI. ARIC has since grown to become an acknowledged and reliable source \nof RCI information and knowledge. It also supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, adopted in 2008, \nwhich defined regional integration as one of its three development agenda and RCI as one of its \ncore specialization and operational areas.2 \n \n2.  The fifth phase of the ARIC technical assistance (TA) will support the \u201c3 Is\u201d agenda of \ninnovation, inclusion, and integration, which was highlighted by the ADB President at the 2013 \nAnnual Meeting. The TA will assist the interplay between the \u201c3 Is\u201d by sharing innovation and \nknowledge through regional dialogue and cooperation, to promote more inclusive growth for the \nregion. The TA will build on the success of past phases of the ARIC TA and help ADB analyze \nmore complex, new RCI challenges. It will also help formulate concrete policy actions for the \nregion  in  dealing  with  the  continuing  global  transformation.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Regional economic integration plays a vital role in improving productivity, accelerating \neconomic growth, and reducing poverty. It is thus a welcome development that RCI has gained \nmomentum in Asia and the Pacific. For instance, intraregional trade rose from 54.9% in 2000 to \n59.3% in 2010, though it has fallen back to 54.9% in 2012. Free trade agreements (FTAs) \ncontinue to proliferate\u2014135 FTAs had been concluded by July 2013, up from 46 in 2000. The \nregion\u2019s share of total foreign asset holdings also rose from 15.1% in 2008 to 18.5% in 2011. \n  \n4.  However, while RCI has advanced since the Asian financial crisis, progress has been \nslow and gradual in many of today\u2019s complex and sensitive RCI areas, such as risk sharing, \ntrade in services, labor mobility, and the \u201cnoodle bowl effect\u201d caused by proliferation of bilateral \nand regional FTAs.4 Political differences have also undermined RCI progress. After the global \nfinancial crisis, the region and the world have grown more interconnected and multipolar, and \nAsia stands to gain from strengthening regional ties. In particular, greater regional cooperation \n                                                \n1  In this paper, \"region\" refers to Asia and the Pacific. ADB will seek a no-objection letter from the relevant \ngovernments in the event that the technical assistance (TA) will undertake certain activities in their territory. \n2  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 November 2013. \n4  Noodle bowl effect refers to the complication that arises from the proliferation of free trade agreements. \n ", "2   \nwill help Asia\u2019s economies develop more unified positions and policy options in relation to \nadvanced and developing economies outside the region. \n \n5.  Asia\u2019s RCI model is unique. Different from Europe or other parts of the world, the region \nhas made solid progress in RCI, based on its pragmatic, bottom-up, institution-light, and private-\nsector-led  approach.  After  the  2008/09  global  financial  crisis,  advanced  economies  are \nundergoing a prolonged period of structural adjustment and weaker economic growth\u2014a \u201cnew \nnormal.\u201d This means Asia must become more self-reliant in developing new sources of growth. \nRCI can play a more central role than in the past by easing trade flows, promoting deeper \nfinancial integration, and creating seamless logistics and infrastructures. Sustained regional \ncooperation may also result in better coordinated macroeconomic, financial, and trade policies \nthat help drive a more efficient and welfare-oriented region. Effective cooperation can help \nmaximize net benefits and lay the foundation for more inclusive growth. \n \n6.  However, the eurozone sovereign debt crisis also underscores the need to understand \nthe costs of greater integration. This is particularly relevant in terms of monetary and financial \ncooperation, where increased uncertainty and finance sector volatility continue to threaten the \nstability of global and regional economies. These key risk factors are important concerns for the \nregion\u2014and they need to be tracked, their regional implications considered, and measures to \nmitigate their effects defined.  \n \n7.  ARIC holds a unique position to assist RCI, having gained expertise in disseminating \nRCI knowledge and information widely, efficiently, and inexpensively. By providing reliable, \ntimely, and accurate information on RCI, ARIC will further help the region understand costs and \nbenefits  of  regional  integration.  ARIC  will  also  strengthen  its  collaboration  with  other \ndepartments of ADB, as well as institutions in the region, in both producing and disseminating \nknowledge on regional economic integration and cooperation.   \n \n8.  Over the past 7 years, ARIC has become a reliable source of knowledge and information \non  RCI.  It  provides  up-to-date  information  on  (i)  RCI-related  studies,  news,  opinions,  and \neditorials on RCI; (ii) indicator databases such as trade integration and FTAs; investment, \nmacroeconomic, monetary, and financial indicators; tax incentives; and climate change action \nplans and commitments; (iii) calendars of economic data releases and RCI events; and (iv) early \nwarning  system  indicators.  Its  key  publication\u2014the  Asian  Economic  Integration  Monitor \n(AEIM)\u2014has helped policymakers in ADB developing member countries to increase awareness \nand knowledge on RCI trends and issues. The ARIC website and its publications have also \nbeen recognized by top-tier media like BBC, Bloomberg, CNBC, the Financial Times, Reuters, \nand Wall Street Journal as a reliable source of economic and RCI information. ARIC also \nassists the preparation of the economic prospects and policy issues for ASEAN+3, ADB\u2019s \ncontribution to the semiannual ASEAN+3 finance and central bank deputies\u2019 meetings.5 \n \n9.  From 1 January to 15 October 2013, the ARIC website has attracted 53,000 unique \nvisitors  with  over  439,000  page  views.  Over  440  organizations  ranging  from  multilateral, \nregional, academic, government, media, and private institutions have embedded links to the \nARIC  website. These  include  the  Association of  Southeast  Asian  Nations;  Bloomberg; the \nDepartment of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia); Department of Trade Negotiations \n(Thailand);  East  Asia  Forum;  Harvard  University;  International  Labor  Organization;  Johns \nHopkins  University;  Monash  University;  National  University  of  Singapore;  Organisation  for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development; Reuters; the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education \nOrganization; United Nations; University of California, Berkeley; University of Melbourne; Wall \n                                                \n5  ASEAN+3 = 10 ASEAN members plus the People's Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. \n ", "  3 \nStreet Online; World Bank and World Trade Organization. The ARIC website was accessed in \nover 186 countries in 2012, with an average of 5,600 visits from the top 10 countries\u2014the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China, India,  Indonesia, Japan,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  Singapore, \nThailand, the United States, and Viet Nam. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  Impact. The impact will be the enhanced implementation of existing RCI initiatives and \nthe development of new ones by key stakeholders. The impact will be measured by the number \nintraregional agreements and other forms of cooperation (such as policy dialogue), as well as \nthe degree of regional integration as evident from indicators of regional cross-border flows.  \n \n11.  Outcome.  The  outcome  will  be  the  increased  utilization  of  ARIC\u2019s  RCI-related \nknowledge products by key stakeholders in Asia and the Pacific.6 The increased usage will be \nmeasured through the number of media citations and interviews; use of its data and information \nin management speeches and demand from its web-based clients. It is expected that access to \nthe ARIC website will grow in line with the average annual growth of its website statistics for \n2006\u20132012.7 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  will  produce  and  disseminate  high-quality  RCI  knowledge  products  and \ninformation to develop the capacity of its stakeholders to promote greater regional integration. \nFor this phase, the knowledge work will focus on complex, second generation RCI issues such \nas drivers and \u201cderailers\u201d of RCI, infrastructure connectivity and financing, labor mobility and \nremittances, cooperation between developing countries in Asia, role of the private sector in RCI, \nand special regional economic zones among others. The goal of the knowledge work is to \ncreate and share innovative ideas, policy options, and regional solutions to pressing RCI issues. \n \n13.  In step with these aspirations, the TA will produce the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Publication of three issues of the AEIM. In addition to providing updates on RCI \nprogress,  the  report  will  feature  high-quality  thematic  chapters  on  second \ngeneration RCI issues. The key RCI indicators in the report will also be made \navailable for downloading online. In addition to East Asia and Southeast Asia, the \nreport will also emphasize the importance of Central and West Asia, South Asia, \nand the Pacific in the region. \n(ii)  Publication of other RCI-related knowledge products, including 15 issues of the \nRCI information pack, 10 working papers on RCI, and 10 RCI blogs. The RCI \ninformation pack will report upcoming events across the four pillars of ADB\u2019s RCI \nstrategy:  (i)  cross-border  infrastructure  and  related  software,  (ii)  trade  and \ninvestment, (iii) money and finance, and (iv) regional public goods. It will also \ntrack key  macro  interdependence  indicators.  The  working  paper  on RCI  will \n                                                \n6  Key stakeholders comprise staff and officers\u2014particularly from regional departments that are managing RCI \ninitiatives\u2014from ADB, developing member countries, and regional or subregional institutions that work in the area \nof RCI. \n7  Estimated annual average web statistics are 600,000 page views, 115,000 visits, and 100,000 unique visitors. \n ", "4   \nanalyze important regional integration issues, while RCI blogs will provide short \nand punchy articles on key RCI lessons. \n(iii)  Timely and accurate RCI databases with expanded country coverage to include \nIndia, Kazakhstan and Papua New Guinea. Some enhancements will also be \nmade to allow easy downloads of key \u201ctakeaway products.\u201d \n(iv)  A more informative and updated website to include a customized view for policy \nmakers, researchers, students, media, and civil society. The TA also plans to \nconduct an extensive user survey to identify the strength and weaknesses of the \nwebsite. The feedback will be used to further improve the site. \n(v)  An RCI roundtable to serve as a venue to discuss and share RCI knowledge and \nexperiences  by  key  stakeholders  across  the  region.  Three  subregional \nconsultations to disseminate RCI knowledge and gather feedback and lessons \nfrom other subregions\u2014particularly Central and West Asia, South Asia and the \nPacific\u2014will also be held.  \n(vi)  Stronger horizontal support to improve RCI knowledge sharing and coordination \nwith regional and other departments in ADB.  \n \n14.   As global growth remains tepid and unresolved policy issues in advanced economies \ntrigger economic and financial volatility, RCI remains a helpful strategy for the region. RCI can \nhelp manage the risks from increased interdependence and at the same time maximize the \nbenefits from open regionalism. ADB is a leader in this area and the TA supports the ADB\u2019s \nleadership through its three critical functions: \n \n(i)  Serve as a knowledge hub for RCI through its AEIM publication, regional integration \nand  financial  vulnerability  indicators,  and  FTA  databases.  While  the  more \nstraightforward  issues  have  been  addressed  in  previous  ARIC  TA  projects,  this \nphase will focus its knowledge work on the more difficult second generation RCI \nissues. \n(ii) Support ADB's participation in regional and/or global forums, such as dialogue with \nAPEC,  ASEAN,  ASEAN+3,  and  Asia\u2013Europe  Meeting,  among  others.  A  new \ndirection is to go outside of Southeast Asia and work with other regional initiatives \nand institutions to share the lessons and experiences of Southeast Asia. \n(iii) Provide  horizontal  support  to  RCI  work  of  other  ADB  departments  (Regional \nDepartments, Economics and Research Department, and Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department)  and  RCI  Community  of  Practice.  This  TA  envisages \ngreater  dialogue  and  consultation to  design  RCI-related knowledge  work that  is \naligned with ADB priorities and operations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.   The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund8 and (ii) $1,000,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  The  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n                                                \n8  Established by ADB. \n ", "  5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency. OREI will implement the TA in consultation with and \nsupport from other ADB departments, offices, and communities of practice. The RCI community \nof practice will serve as an advisory committee for TA implementation. The TA will explore the \npossibility  of  collaborating  with  regional  \u201ccenters  of  excellence\u201d\u2014Analytical  Centre  on \nGlobalization  and  Regional  Cooperation,  Asian  Institute  of  Management,  Climate  Action \nNetwork,  International  Centre  of  Excellence  in  Asia-Pacific  Studies,  Pacific  Islands  Forum \nSecretariat, the UNESCO Madanjeet Singh Institute for South Asia Regional Cooperation\u2014to \nraise the quality of its implementation. The TA will be implemented over 18 months, from \nDecember 2013\u2013May 2015.  \n \n17.  The  TA  will  require  2  international  consultants  (21  person-months),  20  national \nconsultants  (346  person-months),  and  7  resource  persons  (3  person-months).  Individual \nconsultants and resource people will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The scope of work and outline terms \nof reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  A team of OREI staff (at least three international staff: one of them acting as the project \nleader, one national officer, and  one operational assistant), assisted by an ARIC principal \neconomic analyst (who is a national consultant), will oversee and lead the implementation of the \nTA. International consultants will be hired under the TA\u2014a regional cooperation economist who \nwill prepare special studies on RCI and assist in ARIC seminars; and an economics and copy \neditor who will edit ARIC and OREI publications. National consultants will include one principal \neconomic analyst who will assist in the supervision of ARIC\u2019s operations, and coordination and \nconsolidation of its output; four senior economic analysts who will lead the delivery of ARIC\u2019s \ncore services, and 10 economic analysts who will maintain and update the content of the ARIC \nwebsite  and  assist  in  the  preparation  of  ARIC  publications  and  seminars.  Other  national \nconsultants include one website developer, one multimedia designer and developer, one system \nand database developer, one typesetter, and one project specialist to provide administrative \nsupport. Three person-months will be allotted to engage internationally distinguished experts \nwho will be invited to be resource persons at RCI seminars. \n \n19.  Purchases of equipment (computer hardware and software) and statistical databases will \nbe undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time \nto time) and in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology and \nOffice of Administrative Services. After the TA is completed, all equipment will be disposed of in \ncompliance with Administering Grant-Financed Technical Assistance Projects in the Project \nAdministration Instructions.9 Disbursement under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Asia Regional Integration Center, Phase V, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2009.
