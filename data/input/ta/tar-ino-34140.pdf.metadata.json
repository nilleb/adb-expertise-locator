During the 2002 Country Programming Mission, the Government of Indonesia requested \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the \nInterisland Transport Project.1 In September 2002, a Fact-Finding Mission visited Indonesia and \nreached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, terms of reference for \nconsulting services, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements of the \nTA.2 Appendix 1 gives the preliminary project logical framework. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indonesia is an archipelago comprising some 17,000 dispersed islands with a total land \narea of 1.9 million square kilometers (km2) and with a population of over 210 million. Eastern \nIndonesia comprises Kalimantan, Maluku, Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, and West Papua with a \ntotal population of about 37 million and a land area of 1.3 million km2. It has several relatively \naffluent provinces, but its development has lagged compared with that of western Indonesia \n(Java,  Bali,  and  Sumatra),3  partly  because  it  has  a  low  population  density  with  scattered \ncommunities in difficult terrain, a generally low human resource base, inadequate transport \nfacilities, and high transport costs.  \n \n3.  Interisland transport systems are a strategic component of the national transport system \nand provide essential economic and social lifelines for poor and remote areas in the outer \nislands of eastern Indonesia. Transport in eastern Indonesia is multimodal, with significant \nintermodal  linkages;  however,  intermodal  competition  is  limited  because  each  mode  has \ndeveloped its own, often supply-led, market niche. Sea passenger and ferry passenger/vehicle \nservices  have  different  route  and  vessel  characteristics.  Ferries  operate  short  routes,  with \nfrequent service, carrying vehicles and passengers on old and slow vessels. The private sector \noperates few ferry services in eastern Indonesia, and concentrates on the denser routes in \nwestern Indonesia. Sea passenger routes are generally long distance, with infrequent and \npassenger only services but using more modern and larger vessels. Private sector vessels carry \nthe majority of sea cargo, as well as a significant proportion of sea passengers, but are few in \neastern Indonesia. Interisland air transport is the only realistic means of transport in terms of \ntravel time in some areas, but is usually more expensive than alternative modes when they are \navailable. \n \n4.   The impact of the economic crisis in 1997-1998 on traffic trends varied considerably in \nthe transport subsectors. After 1998, sea cargo and ferry vehicles/cargo recovered quickly, and \nsea passenger traffic grew rapidly, due to the transfer of some air passengers. Domestic sea \ncargo and passenger traffic volumes in 2001 were 12 and 83 percent higher than in 1997, \nrespectively. Ferry passenger trends have been volatile since the crisis, and total traffic in 2001 \nwas still 2 percent below 1997 level. The most severely affected subsector was air transport, \nwhere domestic passenger and cargo traffic volumes in 2001 were still 35 and 53 percent below \n1997 levels, respectively. \n \n5.  The sea, ferry, and air transport subsectors are under the technical responsibility of the \ndirectorate  generals  of  sea,  land,  and  air  communication  (DGSC,  DGLC,  and  DGAC, \n                                                 \n1  Interisland transport comprises sea, ferry, and air transport links and their connections to intraisland transport \nnetworks. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 5 August 2002. \n3  Sulawesi, Maluku, West Papua, and Nusa Tenggara all have a poverty incidence generally well above the \nIndonesian national average. ", "2  \nrespectively) under the Ministry of Communications (MOC). Intraisland road connections fall \nunder the responsibility of the Directorate General of Regional Infrastructure under the Ministry \nof Settlement and Regional Infrastructure. Management of major seaports, ferry ports and \nairports has been transferred to state-owned enterprises (SOEs); Indonesia port corporations \n(IPC) I-IV for seaports; the River, Lake, and Ferry Transport Corporation (ASDP) for ferry ports \n(and  some  ferries);  and  airport  corporations  (AP)  I-II  for  airports.  The  National  Shipping \nCorporation (PELNI) is the SOE that operates most of the sea passenger vessels. Other smaller \nseaports, ferry ports, and airports, categorized as noncommercial, together with pioneer sea \nand air transport services in more remote areas, are subsidized and managed directly by the \nrespective  directorate  generals.  It  has  been  proposed  that  infrastructure  with  only  a  local \nfunction be transferred to local governments under the ongoing decentralization process. The \nMinistry of State-Owned Enterprises has responsibility for the financial aspects of SOEs. \n \n6.  Interisland transport subsectors face common issues: (i) poor subsector and intermodal \nplanning with limited integration of subsector development plans with economic development \nneeds, and poor connections with intraisland transport networks; (ii) poor infrastructure and \naging  transport  fleet,  which  often  do  not  meet  both  operator  and  user  needs  as  well  as \neconomic development needs, resulting in a poor level of service; (iii) difficulties to achieve cost \nrecovery due to the long distances involved, often low volumes of traffic, and low tariffs resulting \nin  unprofitable  transport  routes  and  financially  nonviable  infrastructure  facilities;  (iv)  low \noperational efficiency and weak management; (v) poor implementation of safety standards; and \n(vi) limited human resource capital. Other constraints include the lack of clear funding policies \nand  mechanisms  for  central/local  government,  SOEs,  and  private  sector  to  finance  the \ndevelopment  of  commercial  and  noncommercial  transport  infrastructure  and  services, \nparticularly to improve access and level of service in remote areas; and unresolved issues \nrelated to the ongoing decentralization of ownership and management of smaller transport \ninfrastructure facilities. While the above constraints may be observed throughout Indonesia, \nthey particularly contribute to and exacerbate retarded development and poverty in eastern \nIndonesia. In particular, there is evidence that shipping deregulation, which yielded considerable \nbenefits to the country as a whole, and more recently the economic crisis have left some areas \nin eastern Indonesia worse off, as transport services in some low-traffic routes were reduced or \nwithdrawn. \n \n7.  Government planning for the sector is based on PROPENAS/RENSTRA4 2000-2004 \nand the draft Transport Development Blueprint 2004-2024. Short- and medium-term priorities \ninclude  (i)  rehabilitating  transport  infrastructure/superstructure;  (ii)  maintaining/improving \nexisting transport services;5 (iii) ensuring transport safety; and (iv) developing human resources. \nSpecific geographical focus includes regions with peace and order problems and balanced \ndevelopment for both eastern and western Indonesia.  \n \n8.  While the main thrust of the ADB strategy for the transport sector in Indonesia,6 as \nspelled out in the country strategy and program (CSP) for 2003-2005, is in the road subsector, \nan  increased  involvement  in  interisland  transport  is  envisaged,  dependent  on  detailed \nassessment of needs through provision of TA. The CSP emphasizes the need for maintaining, \nrehabilitating,  and  selectively  developing  strategic  transport  systems,  including  interisland \ntransport of passenger and cargo, as well as for balanced distribution of transport services \n                                                 \n4  Five-Year Development Plan/Strategic Development Plan. \n5  Funding priorities include subsidies for pioneer transport services and renewal of transport fleets. \n6  ADB sector strategy was derived from the Transport Sector Strategy Study, completed in June 2000 and financed \nunder Loan 1089-INO: Inland Waterways. \n   ", "  3\n   \n   \n \n \nbetween resource-rich and resource-poor provinces. Key concerns for the transport sector \ninclude (i) reducing/eliminating network deficiencies in each system (air, land, sea), in line with a \ndefined strategic level of service; (ii) reviewing the policies and regulatory issues that adversely \naffect interisland transport services; (iii) supporting increased private sector participation (PSP) \nand public-private partnership (PPP), and the needed regulatory reforms to attract private sector \nfunds; and (iv) strengthening coordination between agencies involved in multimodal transport \nplanning at national and local levels. \n \n9.  The CSP promotes more geographical focus so as to increase the impact of ADB's \nassistance, and several provinces of eastern Indonesia have been identified as priority areas for \nintervention. Improved interisland transport systems in the outer islands of eastern Indonesia \nwill foster better communication, trade, and tourism, and stimulate investment and facilitate \neconomic recovery, thus contributing to balanced regional development and poverty reduction. \nImproved transport links will also facilitate both inward and outward access for social purposes \nincluding education, health, and other services. This is in line with the recommendations of the \nPoverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  for  Indonesia,  which  promotes  improvements  in \nregional  equity  and  emphasizes  the  need  to  enhance  long-term  growth  prospects  through \nnecessary investment to provide for infrastructure, services, and human development. The \nproject initial poverty and social assessment is in Appendix 2. \n \n10.  The main source of external assistance for interisland transport is the Government of \nJapan. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has been the only active aid \nagency for ferry transport with loans for seven ferry links. The Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) has financed a study of the nationwide ferry service roads, which was completed \nin 1998. For sea transport, JBIC is funding the development of 15 ports in eastern Indonesia \nthrough  the  Small  Ports  Development  Project,  as  well  as  the  Kupang  and  Bitung  Ports \nDevelopment Project, while JICA has funded a port development strategy for Indonesia in 1999, \nand will provide assistance for a study of the development of the Indonesian domestic sea \ntransport and marine industry starting in late 2002. For air transport, JBIC has been funding the \nupgrading of international and regional airports, as well as the rehabilitation of 36 small airports, \nwhile  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (SIDA)  is  providing \nassistance for preparing an integrated modernization plan for air transport in eastern Indonesia.7 \nThe World Bank has presently no significant involvement in interisland transport in Indonesia. \nADB has focused its assistance on ports development (with 10 loans amounting to $312 million \nand 13 TAs amounting to $3 million) and, to a lesser extent, on airports development in eastern \nIndonesia (with 2 loans amounting to $234 million and 3 TAs amounting to $1.7 million). ADB \nhas not been involved in ferry transport in the past. While past ADB projects in the port \nsubsector  have  been  generally  successful,  the  two  airport  projects  have  encountered \nimplementation difficulties, mainly due to the impact of the Asian financial crisis and peace and \norder problems.8 The lessons learned have been incorporated in the TA design. \n                                                 \n7  Outputs of the study include a network plan, completed in 2001, and master plans for 20 small airports in eastern \nIndonesia, to be completed by November 2003. \n8  The latest ADB-financed port project, Loan 1559-INO: Belawan, Banjarmasin and Balikpapan Ports Project, for \n$100 million, approved on 30 September 1997, was cancelled in May 1999 as a result of the financial crisis. The \nlatest ADB airport project, Loan 1586-INO: Eastern Islands Air Transport Development Project, for $124 million, \napproved on 8 December 1997, is also likely to be cancelled by the Government, due to air traffic downturn, JBIC \nwithdrawal from the financing plan, and institutional constraints on funding SOE projects. Loan 1220-INO: East \nIndonesia Airports Project was delayed by 6 years due to the financial crisis and peace and order problems in \nAmbon. \n   ", "4  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA will help the Government formulate and prepare an interisland transport project \nthat  will  rehabilitate/improve  priority  infrastructure  and  connections  to  intraisland  networks, \nreorganize/improve transport services, and improve transport safety. Outputs will include (i) an \nintegrated interisland transport plan for eastern Indonesia; (ii) a project formulation framework \nwith recommendations on priority areas for ADB intervention and a program of subprojects9 \nsuitable for ADB financing; and (iii) project preparation for selected subprojects, and supporting \nrecommendations for policy and institutional reform. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The two-phase methodology proposed for the TA places strong emphasis on sound \nproject formulation through carefully assessing the institutional and implementation constraints. \nPoverty and social analysis will be an integral part of subproject selection and design, and will \nidentify  the  necessary  policies,  mechanisms  and  complementary  interventions  to  channel \nproject benefits to the poor. Phase 1 (project formulation) will (i) review the output of relevant \nstudies, the lessons learned from previous projects, the Government policies and programs, the \norganization  of  interisland  transport  systems,  the  traffic  demand,  the  existing  institutional \nframework and constraints, and existing PSP projects; (ii) consult with all relevant stakeholders; \n(iii) prepare traffic forecasts; (iv) prepare an interisland transport development plan for eastern \nIndonesia, covering policies, infrastructure, transport network organization, transport services \n(including transport fleets), funding mechanisms including opportunities for PPP, and transport \nsafety systems (including security aspects); and (v) identify suitable areas of intervention for \nADB, select candidate subprojects, and  recommend an investment program for evaluation and \npreparation in phase 2. At the end of phase 1, ADB and the Government will agree on the \ncandidate subprojects keeping in view the need to maximize pro-poor growth impact, and the \nprinciples  guiding  financing  and  implementation  arrangements.  The  implementing  agencies \n(IAs) will be requested to confirm their participation within 1 month. In view of the number, type \nand readiness of the subprojects, it will be decided whether a project/sector loan approach will \nbe followed in phase 2. Funding policies and mechanisms for central/local government, SOEs \nand private sector to finance the development of interisland transport under decentralization will \nbe a key issue for subproject selection and policy dialogue. \n \n13.  Phase  2  (project  preparation)  will  (i)  carry  out  feasibility  studies  of  the  subprojects \nselected during phase 1, including technical, economic and financial appraisal, and assessment \nof environmental, social, and poverty impacts; and (ii) finalize the project scope, implementation \nand financing arrangements, and required capacity building measures. A key output of the TA \nwill be the policy and institutional reform dialogue, which will be initiated in phase 1 with the \nanalysis of sector and subsector constraints, and will result in the preparation of an action plan \nin phase 2. Outline terms of reference for the TA consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.275 million equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange component of $720,000 and a local cost component of $555,000 equivalent. The \n                                                 \n9  Such subprojects may include rehabilitation/upgrading/development of secondary airports and pioneer airstrips, \nseaports and ferry ports, and their connections to intraisland networks; improvement of pioneer transport services \nthrough PPP; and improvement of air, maritime, and ferry transport safety, including security aspects. \n   ", "  5\n   \n   \n \n \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance $1,000,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $280,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill  provide  the  remaining  $275,000  equivalent  in  kind  to  cover  the  costs  of  office \naccommodation,  counterpart  staff,  as  well  as  traffic  surveys  and  studies  related  to  TA \nimplementation. A detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 4.  The Government has been advised \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  TA  will  require  about  65  person-months  of  consulting  services:  about  24 \ninternational and 41 domestic. The consultants will have expertise in (i) transport planning and \neconomics; (ii) airport and port engineering, operations, and management; (iii) air, sea, and ferry \ntransport  policies,  finance,  institutional  reform,  and  institutional  development;  (iv)  financial \nanalysis and PPP; (v) development economics; and (vi) environmental, social, and resettlement \nissues. An international consulting firm in association with domestic consultants will be selected \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using quality-and-cost based \nselection, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n16.  The Secretariat General of MOC (SGMOC) will be the executing agency for the TA. \nMOC's Research and Development Agency (R&D) will be the IA for phase 1. A counterpart \nteam led by R&D and including SGMOC, Planning Service, DGAC, DGLC, and DGSC will be \nestablished to coordinate TA activities and work with the consultants daily. For phase 2, DGAC, \nDGLC, and DGSC, under the coordination of SGMOC, will be the IAs for the subprojects falling \nunder their responsibility, and will establish counterpart teams. A steering committee chaired by \nSGMOC and comprising relevant agencies of MOC, BAPPENAS, the Ministry of Finance, the \nMinistry  of  State-Owned  Enterprises,  and  SOEs  will  be  established  to  oversee  TA \nimplementation.  Local  stakeholders,  including  local  governments,  nongovernment \norganizations, private sector, and civil society, will be involved through national workshops and \nregional consultations. Local governments involved as subproject IAs, if any, will be represented \nin  the  steering  committee  during  phase  2.  R&D  will  provide  the  consultants  with  office \naccommodation (suitably furnished) and communications facilities for both phases of the TA. \nEquipment for the TA office will be procured under the consultant contract with arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB, and will be transferred to the Government upon completion of the TA. \n \n17.  The consultants will be fielded in May 2003, and will carry out their work over 9 months \nending in February 2004. They will submit an inception report, interim report, phase 2 inception \nreport, draft final report, and final report before the end of months 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9, respectively. \nBrief progress reports will be prepared at the end of months 2, 3, 6, and 7. Tripartite meetings \ninvolving ADB, the Government, and the consultants will discuss the findings of the inception, \ninterim, and draft final reports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for preparing the Interisland Transport Project, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n   ", "6  Appendix  1 \nPROJECT LOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators  Monitoring  Assumptions and Risks \nMechanisms \nGoal       \nEconomic development of the  Regional income  Baseline surveys  Interisland transport \nproject area  Per capita income  Government official  development will impact \n  Agriculture indicators  statistics  economic, social, and other \n  Trade indicators  Asian Development  activities. \n  Employment  Bank (ADB) \n  monitoring of baseline \nindicators \n \nPoverty reduction in the project  Relevant regional indicators,  Baseline surveys  Economic and political stability \narea  e.g., facilities increased or  ADB poverty \n  improved \u2013 health, schools,  assessment \nshops, etc.  Government official \n  statistics \nPoverty indicators  ADB monitoring of \n- subsistence farmers  baseline indicators \n- unemployment levels \n- income/wage levels \n- access to water, \neducation, and health \n \nObjectives and Purpose       \n \n Significant rehabilitation and  Increase in traffic  Traffic surveys, local  Counterpart funding for \nimprovement in interisland  (passengers/cargo/vehicle)  statistics  implementing the project is \ntransport infrastructure and  Frequency of services  Operator surveys   adequate. \nservices for operators and users  Increase in productivity,     \n  especially port cargo  Traffic growth occurs as \noperations  projected. \n \nDevelopment of new routes and  Kilometers of new routes  Operator surveys,   \nnew traffic  Frequency/capacity of  Directorate General \nImproved access to poor areas  transport services  of Land \n  Communications, \nDirectorate General \nof Sea \nCommunications, and \nDirectorate General \nof Air \nCommunications \nsurveys \n \nReduced transport costs and  Decrease in transport costs  Operator surveys  Facilities will be properly \ntravel time  and travel time  maintained and not be allowed \nto deteriorate. \n \nImproved transport safety  Decrease in accidents/  Local official statistics  Subprojects impact on safety \ndeaths, injuries/overloading  and enforcement of safety \nof vessels and trucks  standards improves. \n \nIncreased private sector  Drafting and implementation  Processing and  Legal and regulatory \nparticipation (PSP) in interisland  of policies  review missions;  framework for PSP is \ntransport infrastructure and  Number of PSP projects  Project Completion  improved. \nservices  implemented  Review (PCR), \nBalance of public/private  Project Performance \nproviders  Audit Reports \n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 1) ", "  Appendix 1  7   \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators  Monitoring  Assumptions and Risks \nMechanisms \nOutputs       \nStrategic planning framework for  Plan prepared by September  Technical Assistance  Implementing agencies (IAs), \ninterisland transport in Eastern  2003 and agreed upon by  (TA) review missions  local governments, and private \nIndonesia  the end of October 2003  and tripartite  sector are willing to assist in \nmeetings, TA reports,  planning phase and relevant \nand TA Completion  data available on time. \nReport   \n \nRehabilitation/upgrading  Rehabilitation/improvement  Review missions,  Counterpart funds and \n/development of priority  program implemented  PCR  onlending mechanism (if \ninfrastructure  required) are available. \n \nSustainable improvement/  Level of service improved  Review missions  Consultants, contractors, and \nreorganization of transport  Sustainable funding  IAs implement the Project \nservices  mechanism established  effectively, and local \ngovernments support it. \n \nImprovement of traffic safety  Traffic safety measures  Review missions,  Local governments support \nsystems  implemented  PCR  implementation. \n \nInstitutional strengthening/  Services implemented  Review missions,  Government implements \ncapacity building  Improvement of IAs capacity  PCR  services as planned. \n   \nInputs       \nPPTA Consultants  Consultants   recruited by  Tripartite meetings,  Budget sufficient \n  May 2003.

Country Poverty Reduction Partnership \nAgreement?   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia. By targeting isolated areas with high poverty \nincidence and including not only improvement but also development of transport infrastructure such as small ports and \nairports or sea/air landing facilities, the Project will contribute to link remote communities to provincial centers/markets \nand foster both economic growth and poverty reduction in the targeted areas. Moreover, as one of its components \nfocuses on transport services, the Project has potential to address transport users needs, and thus to target direct \npoverty reduction objectives.  During technical assistance (TA) implementation, the pursuit of this objective in various \ndirections will be studied:  establishment of mechanisms fostering lower transport prices; development of initiatives \nfavoring private sector transport services and increased competition; improvement of transport logistics, cargo/storage \nspace distribution, and schedules so as to fit the needs of the poorer transport users; or provision of small infrastructure \nor services that may improve the trading potential of the poor and improve their access to transport.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? Poverty analysis will be an integral part of subproject selection/design and \nwill be based on quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Subproject selection will include the combined analysis of \nsector  poverty  data  with  country,  region,  and  subproject  level  poverty  data  and  will  involve  field-based  poverty \nassessments/stakeholder consultation. Subproject planning/design will entail comprehensive social analysis to identify \nthe type of intervention that may directly benefit the poor. \nPoverty Classification (final classification will depend on TA and loan processing findings)      NC                               \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis. Project selection will involve the organization of consultation workshops at national and regional \nlevel, involving all major stakeholders, including transport providers, transport users, and concerned nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) with interest in interisland transport issues. Once the subprojects are selected, consultation with \nlocal  stakeholders  will  be  at  the  core  of  subproject  design  and  implementation.  Participation  and  consultation \nmechanisms will have particular intensity in defining intervention under the transport services component. For small-scale \nsubprojects targeting specific communities, project planning and implementation may be carried out through community-\ndriven design mechanisms directly involving the beneficiary communities and NGOs facilitation.  \nParticipation strategy required                                                                                                           Yes \n \nD.
