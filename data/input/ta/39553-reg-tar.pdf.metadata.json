The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting several key initiatives for subregional \ncooperation in Southeast Asia, two of which are BIMP-EAGA (Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, \nMalaysia,  Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area)  and  the  IMT-GT  (Indonesia,  Malaysia, \nThailand Growth Triangle).  Following early cooperation gains,1 both initiatives suffered from the \nregional impact of the 1997 financial crisis and are in the process of building capacity to have a \nsustainable impact on development and growth in the region. At the 11th ASEAN Summit in \nDecember  2005  in  Kuala  Lumpur,  regional  leaders  reaffirmed  their  commitment  to  the \nrevitalization of both subregional initiatives, and acknowledged their potential importance. ADB \nparticipated, along with the ASEAN Secretariat, in the 2nd BIMP-EAGA and the 1st IMT GT \nLeaders\u2019 Summits held alongside the 2005 ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Summit. At both meetings, it was \ndecided that Leaders\u2019 Summits would be held on an annual basis at the time of the ASEAN \nLeaders\u2019 meetings, and that future discussions would center on a quantitative assessment of \nprogress against key indicators of regional development. ADB was requested to continue its \ncritical  role  in  further  enhancing  the  institutional  capacity  for  both  subregional  cooperation \ninitiatives,  including  by  giving  priority  to  helping  develop  a  road  map  for  IMT-GT  and  an \napproach for quantifying achievements and monitoring of results for both BIMP-EAGA and IMT-\nGT. \n2.   In May 2006, at the informal IMT-GT Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting (SOM) in Indonesia, ADB \nwas invited to become a Development Partner to IMT-GT, similar to its role in BIMP-EAGA as \nDevelopment Advisor, and requested to help formulate a road map for IMT-GT. A draft road \nmap has since been prepared with ADB assistance and is being finalized for consideration at \nthe IMT-GT Leaders\u2019 Summit in December 2006.  In both BIMP-EAGA2 and IMT-GT, a key task \nfor  ADB  is  to  help  catalyze  implementation  of  their  respective  road  maps  to  accelerate \nsubregional cooperation and integration.  The proposed regional TA (RETA) will provide ADB \nwith the means to enhance its role in both initiatives by addressing road map implementation \nissues within a results-focused framework and enhancing necessary institutional capacities. \nThis would be done in a manner consistent with ADB's new regional cooperation and integration \nstrategy (RCI) and recent memorandum of understanding with the ASEAN Secretariat. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  largely  island-based  countries  of  Southeast  Asia  share  common  development \nchallenges and opportunities stemming from their unique geographic context: many of the \nthousands of islands in the region are relatively thinly populated, with local businesses facing \nhigh  and  often  uncertain  costs  of  transport  to  broader  markets.  Other  serious  barriers  to \nsustainable growth of these island economies include high costs of infrastructure (from the \nabsence of scale economies), communication difficulties, scarcity of resources, remoteness, \nand susceptibility to natural disasters.3 Vulnerable groups in the poorer regions, often clustered \nin peripheral and outlying islands, are also adversely affected by serious social problems such \n                                                 \n1  BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT increased links and connectivity, intensified the promotion of tourism, and increased \ninvestment.  See, for example, http://www.bimpbc.org/eagaachievement.asp.  \n2  BIMP-EAGA\u2019s road map was finalized in 2005. \n3  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. http://www.sidsnet.org.  \n ", "2   \nas human trafficking. Furthermore, the deterioration of the environmental resource base4 and \nmaritime regions often disproportionately affects the livelihoods of the very poor. \n4.  BIMP-EAGA  was  formally  launched  in  1994  as  a  key  strategy  of  participating \ngovernments for addressing the social and economic development of their less-developed and \nmore  remote  territories.  The  initiative  covers  57.5  million  people  in  Brunei  Darussalam; \nSulawesi, Kalimantan, Maluku, and Irian Jaya in Indonesia; Sabah, Sarawak, and the Federal \nTerritory of Labuan in Malaysia; and Mindanao and Palawan in the Philippines.  IMT-GT, formed \nin  1993,  spans  10  provinces  comprising  the  entire  island  of  Sumatra  in  Indonesia,  eight \nprovinces in Southern Thailand, and eight states in Peninsular Malaysia, with a cumulative \npopulation of almost 65 million. Both initiatives have focused on promoting trade, investment, \nand tourism with an emphasis on private sector\u2013led growth, and have improved air and sea \nlinks, lowered trade barriers, and promoted cross-border investment. \n5.  Regional cooperation in BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT is noteworthy because it is not just \nsubregional  but  also  subnational,  linking  together  parts  of  relatively  large,  middle-income \ncountries that do not always share land borders due to often vast intervening oceanic bodies. \nThe islands comprising BIMP-EAGA are mostly impoverished and have had periods of civil \nunrest.  They  are  closer  to  one  another  than  to  their  respective  capitals,  implying  greater \npotential for trade amongst themselves or directly with the external world, than to trade with \nother  parties  in  their  own  countries.  These  circumstances  require  a  different  approach  to \nsubregional cooperation than on  mainland Asia, and will thus complement and strengthen \nADB's growing knowledge, experience, and reputation with promoting regional cooperation and \nintegration across the Asia and Pacific region. \n6.  BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT were created at a time when the economies of the region were \nsurging and leaders sought to extend economic growth to more isolated regions through greater \ncooperation. For both initiatives, ADB initially provided seminal studies assessing and outlining \nprospects and opportunities for subregional cooperation. The financial crisis in 1997 disrupted \nearly  plans  and  slowed  progress.  In  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  crisis,  private  sector \nbusinesses  that  were  initially  expected  to  play  the  leading  role  had  to  retrench,  while \ngovernments were forced to focus on the most urgent macroeconomic and structural challenges \nand had little financial capacity to support regional programs. After 2001, as economic growth \nhas  revived,  regional  leaders  have  supported  revitalizing  these  sub-regional  cooperation \ninitiatives and ADB technical assistance has played a helpful role in these efforts.5 The regional \nleaders have also committed themselves to meeting every year to review progress. With the \ndevelopment of the new road maps, an important milestone in refocusing the two initiatives, a \nkey challenge ahead is facilitating the effective implementation of the road maps, including \nprioritized project development. \n7.  In  both  cooperation  initiatives  there  is  a  strongly  articulated  need,  including  at  the \nrespective Leaders' Summits in 2005, for using a framework that can quantify achievements \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

This  would  entail  providing  an  appropriate  database  and  developing  an \nunambiguous and manageable set of priorities within the constituent institutional structures of \nBIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT (working groups, business councils, and meetings of senior officials). \nThese management tools could also be used to improve the design and focus of future ADB \ninterventions to promote subregional cooperation and the more efficient allocation of resources. \n8.  Effective  institutional  and  coordinating  mechanisms  are  vital  for  the  efficient \nimplementation and monitoring of cooperation initiatives like BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT.  While \nthe BIMP-EAGA Facilitation Center, funded by member governments, is already operating and \nIMT-GT  will  set  up  a  central  coordinating  and  monitoring  secretariat  in  2007,  institutional \ncapacity  for  both  initiatives  needs  to  be  further  strengthened.  Program  implementation \noversight, including effective coordination and project and initiative follow-up; working-groups\u2019 \nfocus on prioritized outcomes; and integrated interaction between the public and private sectors, \nneed  to  be  enhanced.  Also,  an  effective  working  relationship  between  government  policy \nmakers and local political and business leaders in the regions has yet to be firmly established. \n9.  The  revitalization  of  subregional  cooperation  will  need  to  successfully  address  new \nopportunities and competitive challenges arising from growing global integration, competitive \npressures,  particularly  from  within  Asia,  rising  energy  costs,  and  the  shifting  contours  of \nmultilateral and regional trade relationships. Increased cooperation in infrastructure, trade and \ninvestment  can  create  opportunities,  but  greater  threats  from  transborder  issues  like \ncommunicable human and animal diseases, natural disasters, environmental degradation, and \ntransnational crime also need to be managed. Sector-specific strategies may also have to adapt \nto new or unanticipated developments like regional energy security in the face of evolving global \ntrends. There is a need for a timely response to new and emerging issues with substantial \nsubregional or transborder effects, and ADB is well placed to assist through quick, policy-driven \nanalytical studies in areas identified in consultation with stakeholders. \n10.  The development needs of the countries in the region are growing far more rapidly than \nthe available resources, requiring the private sector to play a much greater role in helping to \nmitigate financing gaps by leveraging investment flows, particularly in infrastructure. Private \nsector participation is underutilized due to gaps in information relevant to the private sector and \ninsufficient development of an enabling environment. There is need, therefore, to explore and \naddress  constraints  on  stronger  public-private  partnerships  in  subregional  investment \nopportunities. The resource mobilization efforts will also benefit from expanded public sector \npartnerships in the form of improved coordination with other donors and development partners \nin the subregion.6 \n11.  There is also a need to promote information sharing and dissemination and to develop a \nmore effective communications strategy. Both BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT will need an effective \ncommunications strategy for a more diversified audience within and outside the growth areas, to \ncreate awareness of the wide range of opportunities presented by the subregions. Enhancing \nand  widening  stakeholders\u2019  participation  through  information  dissemination  is  an  important \nfactor in the success of such initiatives.  \n                                                 \n6  Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GTZ) (German Technical Cooperation) is also a \nsubstantial contributor to BIMP-EAGA, especially to its Facilitation Center and the BIMP-EAGA Business Council. \nADB and GTZ cooperate closely in supporting BIMP-EAGA, through a memorandum of understanding signed in \n2005.  The  Northern  Territory  of  Australia  became  a  development  partner  of  BIMP-EAGA  in  2005.  Similar \ndiscussions are ongoing with the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The RETA will strengthen subregional cooperation in Southeast Asia through greater \nintegration of the region\u2019s economies. It will speed up the implementation of the road maps of \nBIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT, thus enhancing ADB\u2019s strategic contributions within a results-oriented \nframework.   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Enhance Strategic Direction and Increase Focus on Management for Development \nResults. The RETA will help finalize the IMT-GT road map and subsequently facilitate the \nimplementation, monitoring, and reporting of the road maps and action plans for BIMP-EAGA \nand IMT-GT. Road map\u2013based action plans and work programs will be developed for various \nconstituent  working  groups  of  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT  to  enhance  the  results  focus  by \ngenerating identifiable milestones and monitoring mechanisms. To guide this process, a formal \nand quantitative evaluation and results monitoring framework will be prepared in tandem, using \na set of clear, relatively simple and quantifiable set of indicators. The framework will enable a \nrational  reprioritization  and  sharper  focusing  of  the  activities  of  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT \nconstituent  groups,  resulting  in  greater  effectiveness  of  their  work  programs  with  clearly \narticulated priorities and identified projects along with associated financing mechanisms. \n14.  Strengthen  Institutions  for  More  Effective  Implementation.  Both  subregional \ninitiatives need improved institutional capacities for strengthening implementation effectiveness \nand better program delivery. With greater decentralization, local governments are also expected \nto play a more important role in both subregional initiatives. Recognizing the need to address \ninherent institutional weaknesses, BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT have asked ADB for assistance.   \nFollowing  completion  of  an  ongoing  needs  assessment  of  institutional  capacities  in  BIMP-\nEAGA, the RETA will formulate a capacity-building program as a step toward enhancing the \ncoordination, implementation, and overall effectiveness of the initiative. In IMT-GT, which is \nestablishing  a  central  secretariat,  the  RETA  will  help  enhance  institutional  capacities  and \ncoordinating mechanisms.  \n15.  Generate Responsiveness and Informed Policy Dialogue. Subregional cooperation \nin Southeast Asia is evolving in a dynamic context, affected by changes in the global and \nregional  trading  environment,  investment  climate,  and  delivery  of  public  goods  including \nsecurity, transborder crime, and public health and social issues. These changes create both \nnew opportunities and vulnerabilities. The RETA provides for the engagement of experts to \nprovide prompt and results-oriented advice in response to unforeseen or emergent issues \nrelated  to  regional  cooperation  in  the  subregion  and  to  facilitate  constructive  stakeholder \ndialogue and coordinated responses.  In view of the recent sharp movement in energy prices, a \nreview of the energy sector has already been prioritized by the relevant governments, as has \nthe further refining of a strategy for the transport sector, including the development of proposed \neconomic corridors and other project concepts. Other issues will be identified in the course of \nimplementing the RETA in response to new or emerging developments and in consultation with \nstakeholders. \n16.  Improve  Public-Private  and  Public-Public  Partnership  and  Coordination.  The \ndevelopment  needs  of  the  region\u2019s  economies  are  high  and  growing  in  the  face  of  fiscal \n ", "  5\nconstraints. The relative scarcity of public resources and resources of official development \nagencies necessitates the greater involvement of the private sector and improved public-private \npartnerships. Although the private sector is already an active stakeholder in these initiatives, \nthere is considerable scope for increasing private sector involvement, particularly in investment \nin  infrastructure  by  lowering  information  barriers  through  seminars  and  promoting  policy \ndialogue between the private and public sectors. The RETA will also help enhance cooperation \nand coordination with other potential donor agencies active in the region. \n17.  Promote Stakeholder Participation and Improve Information Communication and \nDissemination.  Given  the  shared  development  and  geographical  characteristics  of  the \ncountries in the subregion, there is an opportunity to assist regional cooperation efforts through \nenhanced cross-border flows of information and lesson sharing. The RETA will assist in bringing \ntogether different stakeholders to share information and draw lessons from common problems \nand solutions, as well as emergent issues with cross-border implications. A communications \nstrategy will also be developed to improve information flows within member countries, within the \nsubregions, and to the rest of the world. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The  total  cost  of  the RETA  is  estimated  at  $1  million\u2014comprising $750,000  to  be \nfinanced as a grant from ADB\u2019s TA funding program, and $250,000 to be financed as a grant by \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2014to be administered by ADB. The TA cost \nestimates and budget are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Coordination  and  Regional  Cooperation  Division,  Southeast  Asia \nRegional Department (SERD), will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, responsible for \nimplementing and monitoring the RETA. This will be done in close consultation with relevant \nADB resident missions, BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT national secretariats of the member countries, \nand the ASEAN Secretariat. \n20.  The TA will finance about 115 person-months of consultant services\u201453 international \nand 62 domestic. Consultants will also be engaged for short-term studies. The consultants will \nbe hired as individuals and will be engaged by ADB according to its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of consultants. \nThe consultants\u2019 outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB will be actively involved in \nthe implementation of the TA, including the holding of workshops facilitated by the TA, and ADB \nstaff  will  serve  as  resource  persons  in  the  workshops  when  appropriate.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over a period of about 18 months, from November 2006. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China; and (ii) ADB \nproviding  the  balance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $750,000  on  a  grant  basis  for \nEnhancement of Subregional Cooperation in BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nRegional cooperation  Regional connectivity,  \u2022  Annual progress reports to  \u2022  DMC governments are \nstrengthened in Southeast  intraregional trade and  the MM and to the SOM in  politically committed to \nAsia subregion through  tourism, and cross-border  BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT  regional cooperation \ngreater regional  investments increased in  \u2022  Contents of joint  \u2022  Regional economies are \nintegration  the subregions, compared  ministerial statements and  stable and growing \n  with the previous 5 years  joint summit declarations  Risk \nof BIMP-EAGA and  \u2022  Critical private sector \nIMT- GT  response and partnerships \n\u2022  Statistical databases for  may not be adequate  \nthe subregions \nOutcome      Assumption \nImplementation of BIMP-  \u2022  Plans of action and  \u2022  Annual plans of action and  \u2022  Governments are willing to \nEAGA and IMT-GT road  work programs that are  work programs produced  undertake policy and \nmaps accelerated within a  clear and consistent  by BIMP-EAGA and  regulatory reforms to \nresults-oriented  with the MfDR  IMT-GT institutional  address identified \nframework  framework are  structures   constraints on regional \n  developed  \u2022  Progress reports to the  cooperation in trade in goods \n  \u2022  Achievement gaps  SOM and MM  and services and foreign \n  minimized between    investment \n  plans and work     \n  programs and actual     Risk \n  performance     \u2022  Certain stakeholders, \n       including member \n  governments, working or \n  technical groups, and the \n  private sector may find it \ndifficult to give up certain \nprojects even if these are \nfound to be incompatible \nwith the enhancement of \nregional cooperation in the \nsubregion \n \nOutputs      Risk \n1.
