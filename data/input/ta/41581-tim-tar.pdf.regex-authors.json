Consistent with  the  overarching  goal  of  reducing  poverty  in  Timor-Leste,  the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) supported two earlier phases to this technical assistance (TA)1 to \ndevelop public sector management and governance skills for improved delivery of services in \nTimor-Leste. During these two TA projects (2002\u20132008), ADB worked closely with the Ministry \nof State Administration (MSA) and the National Institute of Public Administration (NIPA) to  \n(i)  develop  essential  skills  and  competencies  of  district  and  subdistrict  public  officials, \ncommunity leaders, and a pool of local trainers; (ii) and develop and implement a needs-based \ntraining curriculum for this group. Phases I and II trained three groups of people (trainors, \ndistrict/sub-district officers of MSA and village leaders) in six competency module areas: (i) \nproblem-solving, (ii) leadership and management, (iii) practical math, (iv) project development \nand management, (v) cooperation with others, and (vi) local development administration. MSA \nand NIPA trainers were also trained in these areas. Training modules and sourcebooks in \nEnglish and Bahasa Indonesia languages were published and disseminated. Under Phase II, \nthis  training  was  extended  to  mobile  training teams  who  provided  on-site,  on-the-job,  and \ndistrict-based training programs to local officials and community leaders. Under Phase II, an \nadditional  three  competency  area  modules  were  developed:  (i)  local  government  resource \nmanagement, (ii) community development, and (iii) training management.  \n \n2.  Within this context and in view of the effectiveness of ADB support,2 the Government \nasked ADB to provide additional assistance to further develop management and governance \nskills for civil servants.3 This phase III TA project 4 will build on the gains of the first two phases \nin three ways: (i)  it will provide consolidating training to groups already trained under Phases I \nand II, (ii) it will train new identified groups of civil servants (central officers of MSA and \ndistrict/sub-district officers of ministries other than MSA), and (iii) it will develop the institutional \ncapacity of NIPA to provide high-quality education and training programs in response to NIPA \nrecently being delegated as the agency to provide for all civil servant training across the board \nin  Timor-Leste.  The  TA  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  Timor-Leste  2008\u20132010  country  operations \nbusiness plan. The Government reaffirmed the need for the TA during fact-finding mission \ndiscussions from 7 to 9 June 2008.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Capacity  remains  very  low  across  all  areas  of  government  in  Timor  Leste  and  is \ncomplicated by low education and little training, a still evolving role of government, and limited \nexperience of many public servants in public administration and decision making. Building the \ncapacity of the public sector is essential to improving governance and restoring stability, and is \na  top  priority  of  the  Government.  Capacity  building  will  need  to  address  individual, \norganizational, interorganizational, and environmental constraints.5 \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.  Technical Assistance to the Democratic Republic of Timor Leste for Capacity Building to Strengthen \nPublic Sector Management and Governance Skills. Manila (TA 3839-TIM, approved on 5 March 2002); and ADB. \n2003. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Republic of Timor Leste for Capacity Building to Strengthen Public \nSector Management and Governance Skills (Phase II). Manila (TA 4272-TIM, approved on 18 December). \n2  Outlined in TA evaluation reports for phase I (TA Completion Report: Capacity Building to Strengthen Public Sector \nManagement and Governance Skills) and phase II (Draft TA Completion Report: Capacity Building to Strengthen \nPublic Sector Management and Governance Skills) TA projects. \n3  Letter of Timor-Leste Minister for State Administration, the Hon. Arcangelo Leite, to ADB dated 25 February 2008. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 May 2008. \n5  As  outlined  in  Pacific  Department.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  Capacity  Principles  Checklist.  Manila:  ADB  \n(4 August).  \n ", "2   \n4.  Public sector capacity-building initiatives in Timor-Leste have been a major focus of the \ninternational community. However, much of this effort has been limited in coverage, project-\nbased,  donor-driven,  fragmented,  and  discontinuous.  Results  have  been  uneven,  and  the \noverall progress of efforts has been slow. Moving forward, capacity development needs to \nsupport  key  policy  initiatives,  strategically  target  core  government  roles  (including  policy \nformulation, budget management, and personnel management), and foster accountability and \ntransparency in decision making. \n \n5.  The phase I and II TA projects helped build the basic competencies of local authorities \nby providing basic skills training to district and subdistrict officials of MSA and community \nleaders using a needs- and competency-based training curriculum, consistent with priorities \nidentified  in  the  Capacity  Development  for  Governance  and  Public  Sector  Management \nProgram  prepared  by  the  Government  with  support  from  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme. The two TA projects also strengthened the capacities of NIPA and a pool of local \ntrainers on training management. Feedback from the trainees and partners on ADB assistance \nwas sought through three mechanisms: (i) end of course participant evaluations, (ii) testimonials \nand interviews of key MSA and NIPA officials, and (iii) a tracer study (survey of trainees). \nTestimonials  from  the  trainees  and  tracer  study  indicate  that  the  ADB-assisted  training \nprograms  significantly  improved  trainees\u2019  proficiency  and  that  training  interventions  were \neffective in enhancing work performance. Lessons learned from the two previous phases of \nassistance are as follows: (i) the capacity of civil servants is very low and requires a long-term \napproach  and  support,  (ii)  while  training  is  an  important  factor  which  will  improve  service \ndelivery, there are other factors which are relevant to the enabling environment for service \ndelivery (sufficient budget allocation, lack of corruption) which will need to be addressed at the \nsame time in a broader context. Future training under phase III will need to be in line with \nbroader civil service reforms which are planned for Timor, (iii) peer training has proved very \neffective as an option, and (iv) due to the high turnover in positions across the civil service, it's \nimportant  to  have  strong  institutional  systems  and  frameworks  in  place  to  withstand  such \npersonnel changes. These lessons have been incorporated in the design of phase III.  \n \n \n6.  While the phase I and II TA projects resulted in significant gains, many government \nexecutives still lack the necessary competency. Knowledge and skills in a range of areas need \nto be developed, particularly in community development and resource management. Improving \nthe  government\u2013community  interface  and  the  public  sector\u2019s  ability  to  manage  resources \neffectively will be critical in building confidence in government. Further, NIPA was recently \nmandated to autonomously function as the key government agency responsible for civil service \neducation and training. It also has a new mandate to deliver and confer degree programs in \npublic administration. Accordingly, it needs to meet the demand of developing capacities of local \nauthorities, community leaders, and the entire civil service, which in the process will require that \nNIPA\u2019s own internal capacities be strengthened.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The intended impact of the TA is improved competencies of public servants to undertake \nservice delivery. Achievement of this impact will be demonstrated by more efficient, effective, \nand  responsive  provision  of  social  goods  and  services  as  measured  by  government ", "3 \nperformance reviews and citizens\u2019 satisfaction rating of public service delivery.6 The intended \noutcome  is  enhanced  operating  and  functional  skills  of  civil  servants  in  service  delivery, \nparticularly in the subdistricts. This will be achieved by focusing on (i) improving professional \ncompetence  of  civil  servants  by  providing  education  and  training  assistance,  \n(ii) strengthening NIPA\u2019s institutional capacity to deliver quality professional programs, and  \n(iii) improving access by NIPA and the civil service to instructional materials and knowledge \nproducts  on  public  administration  and  governance  training.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. TA activities will be designed in detail with participatory input from \nkey stakeholders, in particular district civil servants. Progress will be assessed against broader \ncivil  service  performance  benchmarks.  Key  civil  service  agencies,  particularly  MSA,  are \nexpected  to  participate  in  monthly  activity  progress  reviews.  MSA  may  use  independent \nmonitors to supplement its own capacity.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The phase I and II TA projects focused on developing the professional competencies of \nlocal authorities to more efficiently and effectively carry out their duties and responsibilities as \ncivil servants. The phase III TA project will sustain the strategic interventions and build on \nexperiences of previously ADB-funded projects in Timor-Leste that were highly successful in \ngenerating results and outcomes.  \n \n9.  To  promote  participation  and  use  of  local  knowledge  and  skills,  the  planning, \norganization, implementation, and monitoring of TA activities will be undertaken in partnership \nwith the Government and stakeholders including other international development organizations. \nAs under phases I and II, where ADB TA modules were utilized or complimented by other \ndonors AusAID and UNDP7, phase III assistance will be coordinated with relevant donors. \nGovernment counterparts will take the lead role in implementing the TA activities, while TA \nconsultants will perform advisory roles such as mentoring and coaching functions. Transfer of \ntechnology from experts to TA beneficiaries will be emphasized.  \n \n10.  Extensive  research  and  consultations  will  be  conducted  to  develop  a  relevant  and \neffective  public  administration  curriculum,  which  will  be  aligned  with  national  development \npriorities, building on an assessment of local capacity in key areas of public administration. \nExisting public administration curricula in the country will be reviewed and adopted to the extent \npossible,  and  appropriate  competency  benchmarks  identified.  The  curriculum  will  specify \nintended  learning  outcomes,  sequence  of  courses,  content  of  each  course,  suggested \ninstructional  and  reference  materials,  teaching  methodology,  and  assessment  methods. \nTraining and skills development will be targeted at public sector benchmarks, and emphasize \naccountability and decision-making. Short customized training courses will be provided where \nappropriate.  \n11.  Under the TA, NIPA will continue to provide training to local authorities based on the six \nmodule needs-based training curriculum developed under phases I and II. Local authorities and \nNIPA have not yet been trained using three new training modules developed under phase II: (i) \nlocal  government  resource  management,  (ii)  community  development,  and  (iii)  training \nmanagement. This will be done in phase III. As under phase II, mobile training teams will be \nsupported to help implement district-based training courses.  \n                                                 \n6  The World Bank has conducted surveys of citizen satisfaction. ADB supported application of citizen report cards \nand e-learning tools on citizen report cards. \n7  Under AusAID\u2019s Capacity Building Facility in Timor-Leste project and UNDP\u2019s Timor-Leste Local Development \nProgramme (United Nations Capital Development Fund).  \n ", "4   \n12.  NIPA will deliver the academic courses with assistance from the National University of \nTimor Lorosae (NUTL). NUTL will confer degrees. The TA will facilitate a partnership agreement \nbetween  MSA,  NIPA,  NUTL,  and  Ministry  of  Education.  It  will  develop  and  implement  an \ninstitutional development plan for NIPA. The plan will include development of faculty and staff of \nNIPA and NUTL. Noting wider public administration reforms foreshadowed for Timor-Leste, \nNIPA must build effective linkages with the independent civil service commission, which is soon \nto be established, especially with respect to agreed uniform public sector standards and roles.  \n13.  As part of the institutional strengthening of NIPA, the TA will provide training for faculty \nand staff to build their professional competencies on curriculum development, subject matter, \npedagogy, assessment, and research. Capacity development of NIPA will be pursued through a \nfaculty and staff exchange program and twinning arrangements with educational institutions in \nthe Asia and Pacific region. In achieving these objectives, NIPA will work under a memorandum \nof understanding for academic cooperation signed during the phase II TA with the National \nCollege  of  Public  Administration  and  Governance  of  the  University  of  the  Philippines.  A \ncapacity-building needs assessment of NIPA and NUTL faculty and staff will be undertaken.  \n \n14.  The TA will facilitate enrollment of NIPA staff in regional professional and academic \nassociations such as the Network of Asia Pacific Schools and Institutes of Public Administration \nand Governance, and the Eastern Regional Organization of Public Administration. NIPA and \nNUTL will be provided with education and training standards, instruments and protocols for \nassessment of teaching and learning, case studies and teaching materials from the Kennedy \nSchool of Government of Harvard University, subscriptions to academic journals, and textbooks.  \n15.  Another key TA activity is the establishment of a system of academic equivalency and \naccreditation (for NUTL) of NIPA training courses. With such a system in place, successful \ncompletion of training courses delivered by NIPA will enable candidates to earn academic \ncredits toward a university degree and/or certificate, or satisfy academic requirements. The \nsystem will increase the stature and prestige of NIPA training programs, and help sustain \ndemand for NIPA courses. MSA and the Ministry of Education are cooperating to implement a \nsystem of academic equivalency and accreditation of NIPA training courses.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $600,000 equivalent. ADB will provide \n$500,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government \nof Japan. The Government will provide $100,000 equivalent. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MSA, the Executing Agency for the TA, will assume the primary role in TA design, \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation of results. To the extent possible, other agencies \nNIPA, Office of Administration for Local Government and Development (OALGD), NUTL, and \nMinistry of Finance will be consulted during TA development and management. Coordination \nwith  development  partners  will  be  actively  pursued  to  ensure  complementarity  and  avoid \nduplication of efforts.  \n \n18.  NIPA, the Implementing Agency, will assist MSA with overall TA coordination with ADB. \nMSA and NIPA will together be responsible for ensuring adequate support is provided for a ", "5 \nsmall team of project consultants to access relevant information, office space and facilities, and \ntransportation. The TA consultants will work closely with MSA and NIPA in implementing the TA.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented from September 2008 to September 2011. It will require 32 \nperson-months of international and 108 person-months of national consulting services. ADB will \nengage the consultants as individual consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Training equipment and materials will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Timor-Leste for Capacity Building to Strengthen Public Sector Management \nand Governance Skills, Phase III, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved competencies  \u2022  Citizens\u2019 satisfaction  \u2022 Citizens\u2019 survey  \u2022 Assessment of demand for \nof public servants to  rating of public service    TA reveals an enabling policy \nundertake service  delivery  and institutional environment \ndelivery     (including adequate budget \n  resources and lack of \ncorruption)  \n\u2022 Top leadership supports and \nis committed to continuing \nprofessionalization of the civil \nservice system \n\u2022 Civil servants carry out \nfunctions efficiently and \neffectively  \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEnhanced operations  \u2022  Government  \u2022 Report cards  \u2022 Enabling policy and \nand functional skills of  performance review  \u2022 Official reports and  institutional environment in \ncivil servants in service    publications  place  \ndelivery, particularly in  \u2022 Top leadership supports and \nthe subdistricts  is committed to continuing \n  professionalization of the civil \nservice system \n \nOutputs  \u2022  120 district and  \u2022  Official reports and  Assumptions \n1.
