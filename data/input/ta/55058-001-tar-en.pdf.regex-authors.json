INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will provide selected developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with policy advice, capacity \nbuilding, and knowledge resources to create the legal and policy environment for private sector \ninvestment and public\u2013private partnership (PPP) projects. The TA will build on and supplement \nother ADB initiatives to foster PPP-enabling reforms and promote private sector participation,1 \nand deliver targeted assistance, as identified in consultation with ADB departments and offices \nas well as government and court authorities. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and the goal of expanding private sector \noperations. This includes scaling up assistance for PPPs to support ADB\u2019s seven operational \npriorities and also underpins the planning directions for 2021\u2014building the capacity of DMCs for \nimplementing PPPs, and strengthening the enabling environment for PPPs in coordination with \nthe regional departments, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD), and the PPP \nThematic Group Secretariat.2 The TA will also support (i) the Operational Plan for Private Sector \nOperations: 2019\u20132024; and (ii) the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 \n(industry, innovation, and infrastructure); 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions); and 17 \n(partnerships for the goals).3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The private sector has contributed significantly to economic growth in the Asia and Pacific \nregion,  generating  jobs,  tax  revenues,  and  many  innovations  that  improve  efficiency  and \nproductivity. Private sector resources will also be needed to tackle a regional infrastructure gap \nof about $1.7 trillion per year.4 However, to increase private sector investment and bridge that \ngap, DMCs first need to create or strengthen certain critical building blocks. \n \n4.  Effective policy, legislative, and regulatory framework. DMCs must develop effective \npolicies, legislation, and regulations that are transparent and able to address the many issues \ninherent in any complex infrastructure project\u2014e.g., foreign investments, taxation, contractual \nrights of parties and enforceability of contracts, land rights, and resource allocations\u2014all of which \naffect the feasibility and bankability of such a project. The legal and regulatory regime is critical \nfor the success of a PPP because it ensures the stability of the procurement process and \n \n1  ADB. 2015.

Regarding SDG 16, the TA will support target 16.3 on the \npromotion of the rule of law to ensure equal access to justice, and target 16.6 on developing effective, accountable, \nand transparent institution. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 August \n2021. \n4  ADB. 2019. Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations 2019\u20132024.

In response to \nthese issues, ADB partnered with private sector entities to set up a debt financing platform to \nboost the commercial development of sustainable infrastructure projects in Asia. ADB, as a \nstrategic partner to the private sector equity partners, will provide TA to support both upstream \nlegal reform work as well as downstream project-specific activities to turn marginally bankable \nprojects into bankable ones.7 \n \n5.  The implications of insolvency and other commercial laws in relation to infrastructure \nprojects are extensive, especially in limited recourse finance projects and PPP projects.8 Having \na robust PPP law backed by a commercial legal framework that provides for protection of lender \nrights and fair treatment by the government throughout the project life increases the bankability \nof PPP initiatives.9 A review of insolvency laws in Armenia and Viet Nam, for instance, reveals a \nneed to modernize these and create a more predictable business environment that will boost \nlender confidence and expand credit availability.10 \n \n6.  Strong governance and institutional framework. DMCs also need strong institutional \nand governance frameworks with well-developed entities and experienced public officials to \nmanage, identify, and mitigate risks associated with complex infrastructure projects.11 Certain \nDMCs face acute capacity constraints and need comprehensive assistance to improve PPP \ndevelopment and public service delivery.12 Indonesia, for example, is experiencing project delays \nbecause government contracting agencies have insufficient capacity to properly prepare and \nprocure projects  on par with international standards, but also because government stakeholders \nlack coordination and clear lines of responsibility.13 \n \n \n5  P.

DMCs also need \n(i)  information  regarding  best  practices,  innovative  and  suitable  structures,  models  for  the \nimplementation of such projects, and lessons from developed and developing jurisdictions;14 and \n(ii) quality precedent documentation from successful project financings and PPP projects that can \nbe  replicated. 15  Insufficient  guidelines  and  model  documents  for  various  sectors  have \ndiscouraged private sector investments in DMCs such as Pakistan.16 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: private sector investment and operations \n(including PPPs) in selected DMCs to support ADB\u2019s seven operational priorities (Strategy 2030); \nand SDGs 9, 16, and 17 increased.17 The TA will have the following outcome: legal, regulatory, \nand  policy  frameworks  for  selected  DMCs;  and  capacity  development  for  private  sector \ndevelopment and the financing of infrastructure projects, including those implemented as PPPs, \nimproved.18 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Legal, regulatory, and policy framework for private sector investment \nimproved. The TA will help reform the legal, regulatory, and/or policy frameworks to ensure an \nenabling environment for the private sector. It will support the drafting and reviewing of policy \ndocuments,  laws,  and/or  regulations  (with  an  initial  focus  on  the  formulation  or  reform  of \ninsolvency laws) to promote private sector development and investment. \n \n10.  Output 2: Model template documentation for infrastructure projects developed. The \nTA will assist key public sector institutions in drafting template documentation for the development \nand  financing  of  infrastructure  projects.  Model  legal  documents  will  be  based  on  the \ndocumentation for projects that have achieved financial close in relevant DMCs and can serve as \nprecedents, such as implementation, supply, and offtake agreements; financing documents and \ndirect agreements; government guarantees and support agreements; regulatory instruments such \nas licenses; and concession agreements and tendering documents for PPP projects. \n \n11.  Output 3: Capacity of key public sector agencies and government stakeholders \nstrengthened. The TA will improve the skills and knowledge of public sector agencies and \ngovernment stakeholders in selected DMCs to produce an enabling environment for the private \nsector and to implement and manage infrastructure projects. The TA will provide training, either \nto specific DMCs or regional trainings and conferences, on (i) policy, law, and regulatory reform; \n(ii) infrastructure project development and financing; and/or (iii) the operationalization of recently \nenacted or reformed legal, regulatory, and contractual frameworks.  \n \n14 ADB. 2019. Public\u2013Private Partnership Monitor, Second Edition. Manila. In one DMC, the lack of knowledge about \nPPPs and the changing legal and institutional framework delayed the progress of PPPs in the energy sector. In \nanother DMC, the lack of well-structured projects limited the development of PPPs despite investor appetite to finance \nPPP projects. Those DMCs that have emerging PPP markets and recently established PPP legislation need access \nto knowledge products to assist the governments in identifying the risks for a given PPP project and allocating those \nrisks between the private sector and public sector or where such risks are shared between the parties. \n15 ADB. 2012.

Output 4: Knowledge resources on private sector and PPP projects developed. The \nTA will support the preparation and dissemination of reports and comparative studies to identify \n(i) market-tested approaches and international best practices in developed and developing \nmarkets; (ii) constraints inhibiting, or readiness factors necessary for, the promotion of private \nsector investment and the PPP modality; and (iii) lessons and trends emerging in DMCs with \nrespect to commercial law reform, infrastructure project development, financing, policy, legislative, \nand regulatory reform, and procurement practices. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,539,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($106,000 from TASF 6; $1,000,000 from TASF 7; and \n$433,000 from TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB, through the Office of the General Counsel\u2019s Law and Policy Reform Program, will \nbe the executing agency and will administer the TA. The TA will be implemented from January \n2022 to December 2025. Based on consultations with ADB departments and offices as well as \ngovernment and court authorities, the TA may initially target (i) Armenia,19 Bhutan,20 Indonesia,21 \nand Viet Nam22 to reform their respective insolvency laws; (ii) Mongolia to create an enabling \nenvironment for PPPs;23 (iii) Indonesia and Viet Nam under Project Regeneration (i.e., the debt \nfinancing platform set up by ADB and its private sector partners) (para. 4 and footnote 7) to \nprovide  supplementary  resources  and  legal  support  on  upstream  legislative  activities  for \nsustainable infrastructure projects; and (iv) Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic to assist a cross-\nborder road project by supporting preliminary screening and assessment of the legal frameworks \nof the two jurisdictions.24 In addition, ADB\u2019s Office of the General Counsel will continue to consult \n \n19 Consultations with the Ministry of Justice of Armenia led to a request for TA to support the drafting of a new insolvency \nlaw and capacity building. This work will build on ADB\u2019s diagnostic report and recommendations on insolvency law \nreform provided to the Ministry of Justice under ADB. 2015: Technical Assistance for Enhancing Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Projects through Support for Law and Policy Development and Transaction Advisory Services.

It also would support ADB\u2019s Competitiveness, Industrial \nModernization and Trade Acceleration Program, Subprogram 1 (Loan 4137-INO). \n22 On 29 January 2021, consultations took place with the Supreme People\u2019s Court of Viet Nam. The court indicated \ninterest in the reform of the current Bankruptcy Law and would prepare a request to the National Assembly. \n23 ADB\u2019s PPP Thematic Group is preparing a PPP road map in consultation with the Government of Mongolia and, \nonce the road map is finalized, will contribute to the new CPS, in which ADB aims to support the preparation of a \nnew PPP law. ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership (OPPP) also is consulting with the Government of Mongolia \non potential support for PPPs through legislative reform and preparation of model documents. This TA aligns with \nthe current Mongolia CPS, where ADB will help develop the PPP architecture to attract more private investment and \nenhance its knowledge work, and which may complement a knowledge and support TA currently being processed \nthat includes a component to support private sector development and the PPP environment.
