INTRODUCTION \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support implementation \nof a pilot cross-border economic corridor around Almaty and Bishkek under the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program. The Almaty\u2013Bishkek Economic Corridor \n(ABEC) aims to further integrate the relatively dense economic area in Central Asia and create \none  economic  space  without  barriers,  following  a  multisector  approach.  ABEC  will  allow \nbusinesses  to  specialize  more,  operate  at  a  larger  scale,  and  achieve  greater  economic \ndiversification and competitiveness with the purpose of exporting goods and services outside the \nregion.  \n \n2.  ABEC enjoys strong political support from the governments of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. In 2017, the two governments created the ABEC subcommittee\u2014chaired by the vice-\nministers of economy\u2014under the Kazakhstan\u2013Kyrgyz Republic Intergovernmental Council, which \nis headed by both countries\u2019 prime ministers.  \n \n3.  This TA builds on analytical and conceptual work completed under Technical Assistance \nfor Assisting the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Institute Knowledge Program \n(Phase 1), which facilitated the preparation of ABEC development reports covering agricultural \nvalue  chains,  tourism,  urban  development,  education,  health,  disaster  risk  management, \ninformation and communication technology applications, and connectivity.1 A joint working group \nof government and private sector representatives performed this work with support from Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) consultants. A steering committee approved an investment framework \nfor ABEC in September 2016 to mark the end of the analytical phase and the start of the \nimplementation phase.2  \n \n4.  The TA will identify investment projects for ADB, the governments, the private sector, and \nother development partners through the platform of the corridor.3 The TA will also actively promote \nprivate sector investments in the corridor, support the further institutionalization of ABEC, and \nassist the ABEC subcommittee in identifying, prioritizing, and sequencing ABEC projects and \nreform initiatives. \n \nI.  ISSUES \n5.  ABEC is a pilot cross-border economic corridor and a flagship of regional integration under \nthe CAREC program. Despite their proximity, the travel time between Almaty and Bishkek often \ntakes more than four hours because of the cumbersome border crossing. Markets for services \nand agricultural products are separated, which limits their scale, specialization, and hence curbs \nthe region\u2019s potential for exports. ABEC will address these bottlenecks through setting up cross-\nborder agricultural value chains, integrating tourism markets, improving coordination in social \nsectors, and shortening travel times for commuters. ABEC interventions are expected to boost \nagricultural  productivity,  certification  and  exports,  create  new  income  opportunities  through \nattracting international tourists, allow for specialized health services and vocational education, \nand further improve the export competitiveness of Almaty, Bishkek, and the surrounding regions.  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Assisting the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Institute Knowledge \nProgram (Phase 1). Manila (TA 8259-REG). \n2  ADB. 2016. Growing Together\u2014Almaty\u2013Bishkek Corridor Initiative Investment Framework. Manila \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 September 2017.  \n \n ", "2 \n \n6.  The governments of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, primarily represented by their \nrespective ministries of economy, the city administrations of Almaty and Bishkek, and the regional \ngovernments of Almaty, Zhambyl, Chui, and Issyk-Kul, have together with ADB developed the \nconcept for creating an economic corridor through investment projects, regulatory reforms, and \nknowledge  exchange.4 This  work  has  drawn  on  the  international  experience  of  the  most \nsuccessful economic corridors. \n \n7.  The two governments envision the corridor as an integrated economic space between the \ncities of Almaty and Bishkek and their surroundings to foster trade, enhance free movement of \nlabor and capital, and modernize infrastructure. The cross-border corridor will promote greater \ndiversification and competitiveness, allowing businesses to specialize more, operate at a larger \nscale, and experience agglomeration benefits. The two cities and four regions can achieve far \nmore together than either can achieve alone. \n \n8.  The ABEC subcommittee, which consists of senior government officials from different \nministries and senior professionals, will oversee the implementation and further development of \nthe corridor with the support of this TA. The private sector will drive most investments to the \ncorridor. Transformative public investments, public\u2013private partnerships, the integrated market, \nskilled human capital, and high-quality infrastructure and services will attract these investments. \nThese investments will require reforms to improve public policy and the regulatory environment,5 \nas well as project preparatory analytical work to showcase the feasibility of the projects and their \nregional impacts. Further to that, this TA will support cooperation between the two governments \nto develop a common regulatory environment that is consistent with agreements under the \nEurasian Economic Union.   \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: strengthened regional economic cooperation \nin the CAREC region.6 The TA will have the following outcome: ABEC is an integrated economic \nspace and serves as a pilot economic corridor under the CAREC program.7 The outcome will lead \nto additional benefits, including (i) forging a coordinated approach to developing agriculture and \nservices in the corridor and making both cities more attractive targets for skilled labor and \ninvestments, (ii) maximizing regional benefits from investment projects and reforms across \nsectors, (iii) increasing the scale and specialization of products and services, and (iv) enhancing \nexport competitiveness. Selected projects will be environmentally sustainable. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n10.  Output 1: Projects and reforms with regional impacts identified and prepared in the \nAlmaty\u2013Bishkek Economic Corridor. The TA will identify and prepare ABEC projects for \nimplementation  during  2018\u20132020.  Benefits  will  align  with  national  priorities  and  maximize \n                                                \n4  The TA is relevant to ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration\u2014particularly operational \ndirection 1 (\"strengthening connectivity between economies\") and operational direction 2 (\"raising competitiveness \nin connected markets\"). ADB. 2016. Operational plan for regional cooperation and integration, 2016\u20132020: Promoting \nconnectivity, competitiveness, regional public goods, and collective action for Asia and the Pacific.

Manila. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \n \nregional development impacts and spillovers. The TA will support the development of a 3-year \nrolling pipeline of regional projects and policy reforms under ABEC. They will be prioritized based \non (i) value for money, (ii) potential to spin off exports of services or products, (iii) bankability and \npotential to attract private investments, and (iv) positive externalities across sectors. The projects \nwill support national and regional strategies and will be aligned with international commitments. \nA  pool  of  international  and  national  experts  will  help  identify  and  prepare  projects. \nRepresentatives from the two governments have identified a set of initial projects for advanced \nimplementation in agriculture and tourism that will showcase the advantages of economic and \nlogistical integration made possible by the corridor approach. Work has already begun on first \nADB ABEC agribusiness project, which will establish cross-border value chains for food products.8 \nTourism facilitation projects are also being conceptualized. \n \n11.  Output 2: Implementation plans are finalized. For the corridor to generate shared \nbenefits in both countries and become replicable, the 3-year rolling project pipeline will be outlined \nin annual implementation plans. The implementation plans will help prioritize and sequence \ninvestment projects and integrate existing public, private, and development partner projects. The \nimplementation plans will outline the necessary reforms and regulatory adjustments to maximize \nvalue for money and attract private investments. Such adjustments will require high-level political \ncommitment and consensus among the stakeholders. \n \n12.  Output 3: Almaty\u2013Bishkek Economic Corridor is institutionalized. The TA will support \nwork of the ABEC subcommittee, support secretariat functions for the ABEC subcommittee \nmeetings, and facilitate the work of sector working groups. This will require maintaining close \ncoordination between the countries and across different levels of government. The TA will also \nsupport outreach activities of the corridor to attract public and private investments. The TA will \nalso suggest different ways to further institutionalize the corridor, including through generated \nrevenues from services for the design and implementation of projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,800,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6), and $750,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.9 The in-kind contributions of the \ngovernments are estimated to amount to $50,000. The key expenditure items, to be financed on \nparallel basis, are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The governments of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff, office, office supplies, all required materials, information, data, \nand other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will administer the TA.10 In particular, the Central and West Asia Department will \nselect, supervise, and evaluate consultants; procure goods and services; organize workshops; \nand provide staff to act as resource persons in meetings and workshops. \n \n \n                                                \n8     ADB. 2017.
