INTRODUCTION \n1.  In December 2012, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide policy and implementation guidance on the introduction of social worker services into \nsocial assistance programs.1 ADB undertook TA reconnaissance in April 2012 and reached \nagreement  with  the  government  regarding  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  terms  of \nreference  for  consulting  services,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements.2 The TA is in line with the PRC country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015, which \nemphasizes inclusive growth and balanced urban development, and responds to goals set forth \nin the Twelfth Five-Year Plan.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The social assistance systems established in the PRC, including dibao (minimum living \nstandard guarantee scheme), aim to protect the fundamental rights and interests of vulnerable \ngroups by focusing on areas such as family care, child education and health, livelihoods, and \nmental  health  of  family  members.  While  common  in  social  assistance  programs  in  many \ncountries, the concept of \"social workers\" is relatively new in the PRC. Emerging service areas \ninclude medical social workers who facilitate patients\u2019 access to and use of medical facilities, as \nwell as follow-up care. Unlike medical patients, beneficiaries of welfare programs such as dibao \nhave no such case workers helping them to access other services, benefits, or programs. The \nMinistry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) has identified the lack of assistance provided by social workers \nto help address beneficiaries\u2019 household needs and access to services, such as employment, \nas one important factor inhibiting beneficiaries who are able to work from transitioning from \ndibao to employment. To bridge the gap between welfare and work and to ensure and create a \nprofessional system of social work services for beneficiaries, MOCA intends to introduce and \nexpand the role of social workers in social assistance. Helping MOCA define the role and \nqualifications necessary for social workers in social assistance is the focus of the proposed TA \nactivities.  \n \n3.  The  goal  of  building  a  cadre  of  professional  social  workers  in  social  assistance  is \nsupported by the National Medium- and Long-term Talent Development Plan (2010\u20132020),4 \nwhich calls for an increase in the number of social workers in the PRC to 2 million by 2015 and \n3 million by 2020. At present, approximately 80,000 people have passed the accreditation test \nfor professional social workers in the PRC. Based on international and domestic experience, \nintroducing professional social work services into social assistance is important for enhancing \nawareness  of  employment  opportunities  for  beneficiaries,  increasing  their  social  inclusion, \nprotecting them from being rejected by society, and improving welfare assistance service quality. \nDespite  efforts  to  date  to  increase  the  numbers  of  social  workers,  challenges  remain  in \nintegrating social work services into social assistance, including the following: \n \n(i)  Poorly defined field of study. The field of social work remains poorly defined. \nThe  job  area  is  poorly  defined  due  to  a  wide  range  of  activities  that  are \nundertaken by social workers in the PRC and the varying levels of professional \ntraining available for each of those roles (professional social workers versus \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in the pipeline in the country operations business plan for the PRC for 2013\u20132015. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 June 2013. \n3  ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n4  Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the State Council of the People's Republic of \nChina.  2010. National Medium- and Long-term Talent Development Plan (2010\u20132020). Beijing. \n ", "2     \nparaprofessional social workers). This TA provides an opportunity to help define \nthe role of social workers for MOCA, particularly in social assistance.  \n(ii)  Gap  between  academic  training  and  practice.  There  is  a  significant  gap \nbetween the academic training and practice of social work in the PRC. There are \ncurrently more than 220 majors in universities in the PRC dedicated to social \nwork, and this number is growing. Despite this, the majority of program graduates \ndo not pursue work in the field, and those who do face many challenges due to \nlack of practical training, internships, and occupational and social recognition. \nGiven the growing demand for social workers within the government and other \nservice  providers  as  well  as  community-based  groups, this TA  comes  at  an \nopportune moment to engage with academic institutions on applied research \ndefining  qualifications,  practical  training,  and  emerging  models  for  service \nprovision. \n(iii)  Lack of social workers trained to provide services for work promotion and \nrelated  services  for  dibao  recipients  and  their  families.  Although  social \nworkers in many countries support the transition from welfare to work, social \nworkers in the PRC have limited training in social assistance tasks, such as \nproviding services to recipients to find jobs and transition from welfare to work. \nInstitutionally, the role of social workers in this area is yet to be defined by MOCA, \nand the TA findings will play a significant role in providing the evidence and \nexperience through scoping studies to fill this gap.5 \n(iv)  Need  for  greater  integration  between  government  and  civil  society-led \nsocial work activities. There are many social work activities in the PRC that are \nsupported by social workers through civil society organizations (CSOs), such as \nmigrant worker services, disaster relief, youth development, elderly care, and \nhealth services. However, current legislation and funding modalities can prevent \nCSOs from playing a greater role in government-led or contracted social work \ninitiatives,  which  prevents  CSOs  from  providing  these  services  and  also \ncontributes to a lack of institutional support for social workers in the field.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n4.  The  TA  aims  to  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  social  assistance  through  the \nintroduction of social work services. Specifically, the TA intends to achieve the following goals: (i) \nidentify areas for involving social workers in social assistance programs through the assessment \nof gaps in the needs of poor households as well as through the creation of services to support of \nthe transition from welfare to work; and (ii) develop strategies and instruments for introducing \nsocial work services and accredited social workers into social assistance programs. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The TA impact will be improved service delivery of social workers in government social \nassistance programs in the PRC. The outcome will be better knowledge and information in \nMOCA to enhance the service delivery of social workers in social assistance, as follows (i) \nprofessional guidelines provided to MOCA for consideration by September 2015, and (ii) a \npolicy  paper  on  social  worker  integration  in  social  assistance  provided  to  MOCA  for \nconsideration by September 2015. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2010.

One of the main policy recommendations from this TA was to provide social worker support for \ndibao recipients to facilitate their movement from welfare to work.  \n ", "  3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n6.  The TA outputs will be (i) a gap analysis and needs assessment, policy, and \nimplementation  recommendations;  (ii) an  international  study  tour  exploring \ninstitutional arrangements and workflows in professional social work institutions; \nand  (iii)  scoping  studies  on  the  introduction  of  social  workers  into  social \nassistance.6 A policy note and one knowledge product presenting key findings \nand major policy and implementation recommendations of the TA will be shared \nwith  local  and  national  decision  makers  at  a  final  workshop  that  will  widely \ndisseminate  and  discuss  the results.  A final  report  will  bring  all  the outputs \ntogether and provide an executive summary of the TA findings.  \n \n7.  The TA will be implemented in three phases over a 24-month period. Phase 1, lasting \n4 months, will comprise a preliminary assessment and analysis of  the PRC\u2019s existing system of \nsocial work and social assistance policies and strategies, including a review of international best \npractices. The analysis will make use of the policy paper and knowledge products generated by \nthree previous ADB TA projects on social assistance.7 The consultant team will (i) design a \nresearch  plan,  including  methodology,  key  research  questions,  budget,  and  schedule;  (ii) \nidentify scoping study issues and locations; (iii) identify international study tour locations; (iv) \nparticipate in workshops and seminars organized by the executing agency; (v) conduct field \nvisits; and (vi) write reports and recommendations based on the investigation and goals of the \nTA.  Phase  2,  which  will  last  for  14  months,  will  (i)  conduct  the  gap  analysis  and  needs \nassessment  of  local  agencies focusing  on (a) the  transition from  welfare  to  work;  (b) the \ntargeting of  working-age and able-bodied beneficiaries; and (c) the identification of practical \ngaps in the system where trained social workers could help; (ii) conduct an international study \ntour focused on best practices in social work service delivery in social assistance; and (iii) \ndesign scoping studies based on the results of the gap analysis and needs assessment. Phase \n2  will  include  a  workshop  to  present  the  findings  and  receive  feedback,  guidance,  and \nagreement on policy and implementation recommendations from the working group. Phase 3, \nlasting 6 months, will (i) finalize all the reports and policy and implementation recommendations; \n(ii) conduct a final workshop on findings and recommendations; (iii) prepare the policy note for \ndecision makers; and (iv) prepare and disseminate the final reports and knowledge product.  \n \n8.  The final workshop will invite participants from local governments, key ministry officials, \ndonors, and research organizations operating in the PRC and  elsewhere to share the TA \nfindings and recommendations. A final report of the workshop will be produced. All outputs will \nbe provided in English and Chinese, and translation and publication costs will be included in the \nresearch costs. \n \n                                                \n6  The specific focus of the scoping studies will be determined in consultation with ADB following the gap analysis \nand needs assessment. \n7  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Strengthening the Antipoverty Effects of \nSocial Assistance. Manila (TA 7438-PRC); ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for \nBuilding Equitable Opportunities into Social Assistance. Manila (TA 7702-PRC); ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for Performance Evaluation Model for Urban and Rural Subsistence Security \nSystem. Manila (TA 8095-PRC). These TAs demonstrate that support has been holistically developed and \nimplemented within the social assistance sector framework. Following the recommendations of TA 7438-PRC, \nwhich highlighted the need for performance monitoring and valuation, both TA 7702-PRC and TA 8095-PRC \nfocused on strengthening different aspects of social assistance programs in the PRC. TA 8095-PRC is exploring \nthe role of CSOs and NPOs in the implementation and monitoring processes of social assistance, which could \nprovide an additional space for the social worker support.  \n \n ", "4     \n9.  Assumptions include: (i) the government remains committed to including social workers \nin  social  assistance;  (ii)  provincial  and  local  governments  adopt  the  recommendations; \n(iii) MOCA and the central government maintain the political will to ensure the integration of \nsocial workers in social assistance; (iv) MOCA has strong and stable implementation capacity; \n(v) MOCA supports the recommendations of the TA; (vi) necessary data and information are \navailable; (vii) the draft final report is of good quality and suited locally to serve as the basis for \nreview by the government; (viii) effective coordination of MOCA, the Department of Social \nAssistance (DSA), consultants, and researchers; (ix) effective participation and coordination \nwith key stakeholders; and (x) the TA will be implemented as designed.  \n \n10.  Risks include (i) key questions, options, and international best practice examples are not \nunderstood at the outset; (ii) local government agencies are unable or unwilling to change \nexisting  systems  quickly;  and  (iii)  local  government  agencies  are  unable  or  unwilling  to \nparticipate in scoping studies.  \n \n11.  Given the dynamic nature of the PRC\u2019s economy, society, and demographic profile, the \nTA consultants will address these risks by conducting research in tandem with local civil affairs \nagencies,  labor  agencies,  civil  society  organizations,  and  other  groups  that  address \nbeneficiaries\u2019 needs. The work will be done in a participatory and consultative manner with all \nrelevant stakeholders, which include the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the \nChinese Academy of Social Sciences.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  space  and  equipment \n(computers),  communications  facilities  for  consultants,  remuneration  and  per  diem  for \ncounterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. The TA will finance (i) consulting services, \nincluding field work and gap analysis and needs assessment; (ii) a conference and workshops; \n(iii) printing and dissemination of policy notes and the knowledge product; and (iv) a study tour. \nDetails of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 24 months from 15 November 2013 to 15 \nNovember 2015. MOCA will be the executing agency for the TA and the DSA will be the \nimplementing agency. A DSA employee will be designated as the TA focal point and will be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  oversight  and  support  of  the  consultants\u2019  work.  The  DSA  will \norganize  institutional  arrangements  and  coordinate  local  staff  for  the  research  in  selected \ncounties and cities. The DSA will also provide a suitably furnished office with computers, utilities, \ntelecommunication access (including a broadband internet connection), materials, maps, data, \nand documents as required under the TA, and will cover the cost of office utilities for the \nconsultants. \n \n14.  A total of 25 person-months of consulting services (two international consultants totaling \n2 person-months and two national consultants totaling of 23 person-months) will be required. \nThe individually hired consultants will have expertise in (i) the design of social work programs \nand policies, particularly in support of the transition from welfare to work; (ii) existing social \nassistance and social work programs in the PRC, institutional frameworks, and monitoring and \nevaluation systems; and (iii) human resources management in social assistance and social work \n ", "  5 \nprograms in the PRC. A national consultant will serve as the team leader. The consultants will \nbe responsible for producing the TA\u2019s outputs and deliverables effectively and on time, as well \nas organizing and carrying out all TA activities, including the analyses, study tour, scoping \nstudies, symposiums and workshops, and policy note and knowledge product. ADB will create \nan internal review group of technical experts and team leaders from the East Asia Department, \nPRC  resident  mission,  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department,  and  others \nresponsible for similarly themed TA projects to ensure inputs from social protection specialists \nand facilitate cross-regional learning. A working group will be set up comprising representatives \nfrom government ministries and CSOs, including UNICEF and the Chinese Academy of Social \nSciences, to review and provide guidance for the research team from inception. \n \n15.  In dialogue with MOCA and/or the DSA, ADB will recruit national and international \nexperts to provide inputs as consultants. ADB will endorse the terms of reference, including the \nduration  and  expected  results.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  based  on  their  academic \nqualifications and relevant work experience.  All consultants under the TA will be selected in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines in the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  Proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). To facilitate implementation, \nADB may establish an advance facility for MOCA as needed and/or utilize direct payment (e.g., \nfor workshop venues). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Strategies for Involving Social Workers in \nSocial Assistance, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \n  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nImproved service  Increase in the  National and regional  The government sustains its \ndelivery of social  percentage of qualified  civil affairs Minimum  commitment to including \nworkers in  social workers in social  Living Standard  social workers in social \ngovernment social  assistance (Minimum  Guarantee Scheme  assistance \nassistance programs  Living Standard  beneficiary data   \nin the People\u2019s  Guarantee Scheme)    The technical assistance \nRepublic of China  between 2015 and 2020  Ministry of Civil Affairs  (TA) will be implemented as \n(PRC)    (MOCA) benefits,  designed under the TA \nIncrease in the number  program management,   \nof Minimum Living  information system,  Provincial and local \nStandard Guarantee  and budget  governments adopt the \nScheme beneficiaries  recommendations \nreceiving support from   \nsocial workers between  Risk \n2015 and 2020   \n  New socially and \neconomically vulnerable \npopulations result from a \nrapidly changing economy \nand job losses, taxing the \nexisting resources of the \nsocial assistance system \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nBetter knowledge and  Professional guidelines  TA review reports  MOCA and central \ninformation in MOCA  provided to MOCA for    government maintain \nto enhance the  consideration by  Workshop and  political will to ensure \nservice delivery of  September 2015  government feedback  integration of social workers \nsocial workers in      in social assistance \nsocial assistance and  Policy paper on social  TA final report   \nthe  adoption of  worker integration in  MOCA has strong and \nprofessional  social assistance  stable implementation \nguidelines  provided to MOCA for  capacity \n  consideration by   \n  September 2015  MOCA supports \n  recommendations of the TA \nPolicy note on key TA   \nrecommendations  Risk \nproduced and widely   \ndisseminated  Local government agencies \nare unable or unwilling to \nchange existing systems \nquickly \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \n  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  and Risks \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
