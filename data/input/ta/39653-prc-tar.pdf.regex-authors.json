During the 2006 Country Programming Review Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  confirmed  its  request  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to prepare the Energy Conservation and Resource Management Project \n(the project).1 In May 2006, a Fact-Finding Mission was fielded to assess the results of available \nstudies and determine the scope of the TA. The Mission held discussions with representatives from \nthe Government of the PRC (the Government) and officials concerned from the government of \nGuangdong Province (GGP). An understanding was reached on the TA goals, purpose, scope, cost \nestimates, financing and implementation arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference. \nThe TA is included in the country pipeline for 2006 and the project in the country pipeline for 2007. The \nTA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  rapid  increase  in  energy  demand  that  has  accompanied  economic  growth  has \ncontributed significantly to increased environmental pollution. Pollution has resulted from the power \nsector\u2019s heavy dependence on coal-fired power generation\u2014of the approximately 2.2 billion tons of \ncoal produced in 2005, about 50% was used for power generation\u2014and limited investment in \nappropriate environmental abatement technology. The industrial sector is also reliant on coal, and \nutilizes obsolete production processes. Coal resources are abundant and production is relatively \ninexpensive. Emissions of major air pollutants peaked in 1995 and subsequently declined, but have \nincreased again in recent years. More than 63% of major cities do not meet the grade II national air \nquality standards.  \n \n3.  The country\u2019s demand for energy will continue to increase in the future, as a result of \n(i) rapid economic growth, projected to be around 8% per year; (ii) low current per capita energy \nconsumption, which is about one tenth that of the United States;2 (iii) the increasing motorization of \nthe transport sector; and (iv) rapid urbanization, with a minimum of 12 million\u201315 million rural \nemigrants per year. The energy sector will continue to be characterized by (i) high consumption of \ncoal,  which  meets  about  68%  of  primary  commercial  energy  demand,  (ii)  a  large  workforce \ninvolved  in  coal  production  and  transportation,  and  (iii)  an  extensive  coal  infrastructure.  A \nsignificant and rapid shift away from coal in the medium term is unlikely, because oil and gas \nreserves and the potential for further hydropower resource development are both limited. Using the \nmost optimistic scenario of (i) increased use of domestically produced natural gas, (ii) importation \nof  liquefied  natural  gas,  and  (iii)  timely  construction  of  the  required  natural  gas  distribution \nnetworks, natural gas is expected to account for only 10% of the primary commercial energy mix by \n2020. \n \n4.  Given the expected economic growth, keeping emissions at current levels will require a \nsteep decline in pollution intensity (pollution caused per unit of gross domestic product [GDP]).  \nIndustrial  pollution  intensities,  pollution  loads,  and  environmental  contamination  will  increase \nunless  the  Government\u2019s  pollution-abatement  incentives  are  adjusted.  At  present,  the \nenvironmental and health costs associated with coal use are not internalized. Consequently, fuels \nthat are less harmful to the environment, such as natural gas and renewable energy, are at a \ndisadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis coal. Increasing the minimum smokestack height for coal-fired plants, and \nintroducing market-based instruments (such as taxation of coal use and use of sulfur dioxide \nemission trading permits) would help reduce the advantage now given to coal. Pollution caused by \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 April 2005. \n2 For instance, current household electricity consumption is only about 4% of that in the United States.  ", "2 \nthe use of coal is aggravated by the economy\u2019s relatively high energy intensity, which requires \nabout 3.8 times more energy per unit of economic output than the world average. \n \n5.  Guangdong is a large province and its energy consumption has a significant impact on the \ncountry\u2019s  overall  energy  intensity.  It  has  the  highest  GDP  of  all  the  inland  provinces  and \nmunicipalities, with expected annual growth of 9% from 2006 to 2010. During the 10th 5-year plan \nperiod (2000\u20132005), Guangdong's GDP surged by 13% per year, while the total installed electricity \ngenerating capacity increased even more rapidly, by 14.9% annually.3 The situation is mainly due \nto (i) ongoing development of energy efficiency standards and inadequate enforcement of existing \nones, (ii) inefficient energy price signals for consumers, (iii) low investments in energy-efficient \ntechnologies and practices, (iv) the relatively large contribution made to GDP by energy-intensive \nfixed asset production, (v) the lack of a legal and regulatory framework to adopt effective demand-\nside management (DSM) policies, and (vi) the need for local and national capacity building in \nenergy conservation.  \n \n6.  The Government has recognized the enormous potential for energy conservation and the \nbenefits  it  can  provide  in  terms  of  (i)  reductions  in  (a)  energy  resource  use,  (b)  financing \nrequirements for new energy supply projects, and (c) the emissions associated with increases in \nenergy  consumption,  as  well  as  (ii)  increased  energy  supply  security.  The  Government  has \ntherefore established a broad target of quadrupling GDP but only doubling energy consumption \nbetween 2000 and 2020. To achieve this, the Government\u2019s top priority in the 11th 5-year plan \n(2006\u20132010) is a 20% reduction in energy intensity. Though Guangdong's energy intensity has \nbeen slightly lower than the national average, the GGP still plans to reduce energy intensity by \n13% between 2006 and 2010, which equals a 2.8% annual reduction. In January 2005, the \nNational Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) published the China Medium- and Long-\nTerm  Energy  Conservation  Plan.  The  plan  gives  priority  to  energy  conservation  over  the \ndevelopment of new energy sources in fueling economic growth. Energy conservation is to be \nachieved in all major industries, and specific key projects have been identified, such as retrofit \nprojects,  energy  system  optimization  projects,  construction  of  cogeneration  power  plants  and \nenergy-efficient buildings, DSM projects, and capacity building for promoting and implementing \nenergy conservation projects.  \n \n7.  The  country  has  achieved  energy  savings  in  industrial  boilers  and  energy-intensive \nindustries such as steel, cement, and chemicals, which contributed to a 70% decrease in energy \nconsumption per unit of economic output between 1980 and 1998. Those industries have been \ntargeted for further energy savings under the China Medium- and Long-Term Energy Conservation \nPlan, through the installation of boilers, equipment, and production processes that are more energy \nefficient following the introduction and implementation of correspondingly stricter energy efficiency \nstandards. As recognized in the plan, there is considerable potential for energy conservation \nthrough DSM programs. In this context, DSM refers to tools and practices to decrease the cost of \nmeeting consumer electricity demand, through investments that enable better management of grid \nelectricity loads and more efficient use of electricity by end users. In particular, DSM programs aim \nto reduce peak demand for electricity\u2014which requires power-generation capacity that is used only \nwhen  the  daily  peak  occurs\u2014through  load  management  and  by  promoting  consumer  use  of \nequipment and appliances that are more energy efficient. \n \n8.  DSM programs are not yet being implemented on a large scale, but studies have found that \n(i) the potential for cost-effective DSM is very large, (ii) meeting demand for additional power \nthrough investments in both DSM and new power-generation capacity is less costly than meeting \n                                                 \n3  By 2005, the total installed capacity in Guangdong Province had reached 48 gigawatts, excluding additional capacity of \n10,880 megawatts, which was transported from western provinces through \"west-to-east\" power transmission systems. \n ", "3\nsuch  demand  solely  through  new  power-generation  capacity  and  power  transmission  and \ndistribution systems, (iii) DSM is fully consistent with the country\u2019s goal of sustainable energy \nsector  development,  (iv)  DSM  is  a  proven  and  effective  method  for  immediately  addressing \nanticipated power shortages, and (v) successful DSM implementation will require the adoption of \nsupportive policies and rules that make DSM an integral part of power sector reform and planning.4  \n \n9.  ADB financed an initial study of the DSM potential in Jiangsu Province. The study found \nthat  an  investment  of  $220  million  for  the  installation  and  use  of  high-efficiency  commercial \ncooling/lighting  equipment,  industrial  motor  drive  systems,  and  residential  appliances\u2014also \nreferred to as \u201cthe efficiency power plant (EPP) project concept\u201d\u2014will obviate the need to install \n600 megawatts of new power generation capacity. In general, it is estimated that such energy \nconservation projects make additional electricity available at 75% of the present electricity cost.5 \nAn appropriate policy and regulatory framework has to be developed that (i) provides incentives for \nconsumers to install energy-efficient equipment and appliances, (ii) fairly distributes costs and \nbenefits between electricity suppliers and consumers, (iii) establishes a mechanism for (partial) \nfinancing  of  energy-efficient  equipment  and  appliances  and  collection  of  payments  from \nbeneficiaries, and (iv) sets implementation and verification rules for EPP projects. \n \n10.  Studies carried out to date indicate that overcoming market barriers is crucial for successful \nEPP project initiation and implementation. Accordingly, the preferred option is for local power \ncompanies to provide the energy-efficient equipment and appliances to the various consumers, \nwho are subsidized to compensate for higher equipment and appliance costs, and must surrender \nequipment and appliances currently in use. Power companies subsequently recover subsidy costs \nthrough an additional energy conservation charge in the electricity tariff.6 Alternatively, energy \nservices  companies  could  provide  energy-efficient  equipment  for  relatively  large  electricity \nconsumers and recover the investment through a service charge.  \n \n11.  In  2005  TA7 was  provided  to  assist  NDRC  in  identifying  options  and  corresponding \nrequirements for the development of an appropriate policy and regulatory framework to promote \nand implement EPP projects, and to prepare the survey and preliminary design for a demonstration \nEPP project in Guangdong Province. That TA\u2019s recommendations will provide the necessary policy \nenvironment for promotion of EPP projects. Also, staff of agencies concerned will be trained in \nconducting energy conservation surveys that will provide the required technical information for \npreparing other EPP projects. The GGP has initially examined the possible scope for an EPP of \nabout 350 megawatts in Guangdong which may include (i) renovation of industrial motors, (ii) \nreplacing inefficient power transformers, (iii) promoting efficient lighting, (iv) retrofitting of existing \nair conditioning systems, and (v) other possible DSM components. \n \n12.  One of the Government's main development objectives in the 11th 5-year Plan is improving \nenergy efficiency, which is consistent with another development priority: that of containing the \nworsening  trend  of  environmental  pollution  and  ecosystem  degradation,  and  improving  the \nenvironment. ADB\u2019s operational strategy aims to help achieve economic growth in an efficient, \nequitable, and sustainable manner, and supports the Government's energy development program, \n                                                 \n4  For instance, it is estimated that enforcement of improved energy efficiency standards and introduction of DSM \nincentives would delay the need for construction of new power-generation capacity of 100 gigawatts until 2020. \n5  The Regulatory Assistance Project, The Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory, and the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil.

Manila (TA 4706-PRC, approved in December). \n ", "4 \nwhich aims to expand energy supplies and promote energy conservation and end-use efficiency. \nADB\u2019s strategy for the environment sector and power subsector focuses on (i) strengthening the \nlegal and regulatory framework for sustainable environmental management, (ii) supporting the \nutilization of economic and other measures to ensure sustainable utilization of natural resources, \nand (iii) promoting the  use of cleaner technologies. ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy for the \ncountry encompasses a range of measures including providing goods and services directly to the \nmost vulnerable members of society and promoting sustainable growth. Therefore, the proposed \nproject will support both national and provincial development priorities and is consistent with ADB \noperational strategies. Guangdong was selected for the proposed project because of (i) insufficient \nelectricity supply and large peak demand, and (ii) GGP\u2019s willingness to make substantial efforts to \nsupport  energy  conservation.  The  proposed  project  is  a  small  part  of  the  overall  energy \nconservation effort in the province and country, but is nevertheless significant, as it focuses on \nDSM, includes energy efficiency and air pollution reduction as main thematic objectives, and will \ndemonstrate a new approach to addressing energy conservation and environmental issues in the \nlong term. \n \n13.  The  proposed  project  will  incorporate  lessons  regarding  design,  preparation,  risk \nassessment, and implementation from earlier projects. Expected efficiency improvements will be \ncarefully assessed, and a mechanism developed for cost recovery under the project to ensure the \nfinancial  performance  of  entities  involved.  Strong  economic  performance  is  expected  in \nGuangdong  Province,  based  on  the  proposed  target  for  energy  intensity  under  the  11th  \n5-year  plan,  in  which  the  Government  has  made  a  strong  commitment  to  accelerate  energy \nconservation  efforts.  The  activities  under  the  project  will  be  based  on  proven  designs  and \ntechnologies that have been used successfully in the PRC or in other countries. Although earlier \nstudies have demonstrated the viability of energy conservation through DSM, risks will be carefully \nassessed during project preparation. The risk of construction delays due to late internal approvals \nand procurement will be addressed by early preparation and procurement training.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The TA will help GGP prepare an energy conservation and resource management project in \nGuangdong Province. The TA outcome will be an agreement with GGP and the Government on \nproject design, a detailed feasibility report, and project implementation arrangements.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  As  discussed  above  (para.  11),  the  ongoing  advisory  TA  will  help  identify  the  most \nappropriate project components for the ensuing loan. Based on this, the TA will (i) assess demand \nand demand-side management potential; (ii) carry out least-cost analysis, incorporating demand-\nside management options; (iii) provide cost estimates and procurement arrangements, and prepare \na contract packaging plan; (iv) carry out economic, financial, and risk analyses; (v) prepare the \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans,  and  provide \nsummaries  of  each;  (vi) analyze  the  financial  governance  and  financial  performance  of \nimplementation agencies; (vii) recommend necessary enterprise and sector reforms; (viii) evaluate \nthe social poverty impact of the project and identify ways to make the project more pro-poor; \n(ix) establish indicators and a mechanism for monitoring them; and (x) support private sector \nparticipation. An initial social and poverty assessment is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "5\n16.  The risks that could jeopardize successful TA implementation include (i) a change in GGP\u2019s \npriorities, (ii) lack of adequate and on-time provision of data, (iii) delay in submission of required \nstudies, (iv) delay in consultant selection, and (v) poor consultant performance. Efforts will be made \nto  ensure  timely  recruitment  of  competent  consultants.  GGP  agrees  to  provide  adequate \ncounterpart support and data when needed and to undertake and update all required studies \naccording to a timetable agreed with ADB. Close coordination among the consultants, executing \nand implementing agencies, and ADB will further mitigate these risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  Total cost of the TA is estimated at $450,000 equivalent. The Government has requested \nthat ADB provide $300,000 to cover most of the TA cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  finance  $150,000  in-kind  by  providing \ncounterpart staff, office space and facilities, and support services. The detailed cost estimates and \na financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will be carried out by a team of consultants with experience in (i) institutional, \neconomic, financial, environmental, and social analyses; and (ii) impact evaluation and monitoring. \nThe  international  consultants  will  include  (i)  an  energy  economist,  (ii)  a  financial/financial \nmanagement and institutional specialist, and (iii) a social and resettlement specialist. The national \nconsultants will include (i) an energy economist, (ii) an environmental specialist, (iii) a social and \nresettlement specialist, and (iv) a financial and institutional specialist. National consultants will \nassist the international consultants in their respective fields. The consultants will be engaged in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its \nBorrowers, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of \nnational  consultants.  The  services  of  consultants  will  be  provided  through  a  consulting  firm \nselected using the quality- and cost-based selection method, following submission of simplified \ntechnical proposals. An estimated total of 25 person-months of consulting services will be required: \n5 for international and 20 for national consultants. The outline terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 4.  \n \n19.  GGP will be the executing agency (EA) for the TA. A project management office (PMO), \nunder the Finance Bureau of Guangdong Province, will provide interpreters, local transportation, \nand  office  space  in  Guangzhou  equipped  with  suitable  facilities,  and  coordinate  with  the \nconsultants during the project preparatory TA work. The Guangdong Provincial Economic and \nTrade Commission will assist the PMO in project preparation and implementation by establishing a \nproject office comprising specialists in the relevant areas, who will coordinate with the consultants. \nOffice equipment financed under the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines, and will be given over to GGP upon completion of the TA. The TA is expected to begin \nin September 2006 and be completed by June 2007.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.

These data and profiles should be sufficiently \ncomprehensive to serve as the baseline for socioeconomic performance indicators. \nPoverty incidence will be assessed based on government poverty lines and $1 per \nday (equivalent to CNY900 per  year). Conduct surveys  to develop  a profile of \ncurrently available transport services and their costs, and assess affordability for \nlow-income groups. \n(ii)  Review the government\u2019s poverty reduction and regional economic development \npolicies, strategies and programs pertaining to the project area. Analyze how the \nproposed  project  will  complement  the  government\u2019s  ongoing  and  future \ndevelopment programs. Consult with local governments to identify development \ninitiatives that could complement the project, particularly those targeted at the poor \nand ethnic minorities, and identify possible sources of funding for these initiatives. \n(iii)  Based on the initial poverty and social analysis, conduct a full poverty and social \nanalysis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis. \nAssess how the proposed project may help improve people\u2019s livelihoods. Assess \ngender issues, identify vulnerable groups and recommend appropriate measures to \naddress  impacts  and  promote  development  opportunities  during  project \nconstruction,  operation  and  maintenance.  Estimate  (a)  the  number  of  project \nbeneficiaries by ethnicity and income level (poor, medium and high); and (b) the \nnumber of adversely affected people by type of impact. Quantify how the project will \nimprove benefits (e.g., market access, employment opportunities, lower transport \ncosts,  and  reduced  travel  time)  for  local  people,  by  income  group.  If  needed, \nincorporate recommended measures to enhance benefits and minimize adverse \nimpacts, including cost and implementation arrangements, into an ethnic minorities \ndevelopment plan, to be implemented as part of the project. \n(iv)  Assist  in  establishing  consultative  and  participatory  processes  during  project \npreparation that will continue throughout project design, construction and operation. \nStakeholders should be identified and representatives consulted so their needs and \ndemands  can  be  considered  for  incorporation  into  the  project  or  as  parallel \ninitiatives. Prepare a stakeholder participation and consultation report, providing \ndetails  of  consultation  meetings.  Prepare  a  participation  plan  for  project \nimplementation. If an ethnic minorities development plan is needed, assist the EA in \ndisclosing the plan to local people. Provide on-the-job training to EA staff in social \nassessment,  participatory  community  appraisal,  consultation,  and  participatory \nmonitoring techniques. \n(v)  Prepare and review the draft resettlement plan and prepare modifications to comply \nwith ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Operations Manual (OM) F2 \non  Involuntary  Resettlement  (2003).  The  resettlement  expert  will  use  ADB's \nHandbook  on  Resettlement  (1998)  as  a  guide  in  preparing  the  plan.  The \nresettlement plan must include village-level impact assessment of project-affected \npeople,  income  levels  and  its  sources,  land,  assets  and  occupations.  Identify \npotential  impoverishment  risks  and  vulnerable  groups,  including  those  severely \naffected through loss of land, those with low income, and others (e.g., disabled, \nelderly,  ethnic  minorities,  unemployed,  illiterate,  women,  children)  and  develop \nspecial mitigation measures, as required.  \n(vi)  Assess the policy and legal framework for resettlement, identify any gaps compared \nwith ADB policy and propose measures to bridge the gap between the policies of \nADB and the PRC. In collaboration with the EA and local government officials, \ndefine categories for impact and compensation eligibility of affected people, and \nprepare an entitlements matrix covering compensation and other assistance for all \ntypes of impacts to achieve full replacement for lost assets, income and livelihoods. \n ", "  Appendix 4  15 \n \nThe  entitlements  should  be  based  on  the  PRC  Land  Administration  Law,  local \ngovernment regulations and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. \n(vii)  Assess and justify that (a) the compensation standards are based on replacement \nvalue,  and  (b)  the  overall  resettlement  budget  is  sufficient  to  implement  the \nresettlement plan based on the proposed entitlements and rehabilitation plans. If \nland redistribution will be undertaken, confirm there is adequate land available for \nreallocation without negatively affecting the host population. If relocation sites will be \ndeveloped, ensure that affected people are consulted on the selection of sites and \nprovision of services. For any seriously affected villages, prepare village economic \nrehabilitation plans to restore incomes of affected people and host people. Identify \ncompensation and rehabilitation options, and develop livelihood rehabilitation and \nimprovement programs, in consultation with those affected. Assess and justify that \nthe overall resettlement budget is sufficient to acquire the land and implement the \nresettlement plan. \n(viii)  Assist the EA to prepare a public consultation and disclosure plan, develop a format \nfor  documenting  consultation  with  affected  people  and  initiate  a  participatory \nprocess  for  resettlement  plan  preparation  and  implementation  among  affected \ncommunities, local leaders, proponents and other stakeholders. Assist the EA to \nprepare a resettlement information booklet for distribution to all affected villages and \nhouseholds. Chinese and Uygur versions of the plan should be distributed to all \nrelevant local government offices and made available affected village leaders. \n(ix)  Review the organizational structure and capacity for resettlement implementation \nand  recommend  improvements  and  actions  required  before  the  start  of  land \nacquisition.  Provide  training  to  the  EA  and  local  government  staff  on  ADB's \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  requirements  and  procedures. Assist the  EA  to \nprepare a detailed resettlement implementation schedule that is linked to the overall \nproject schedule. A summary of milestones for resettlement supervision should be \nprepared.  Develop  an  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  plan, \nspecifying  key  indicators  of  progress,  mechanisms  for  reporting,  resource \nrequirements and database maintenance. Include a three-page executive summary \nin the resettlement plan. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060801151346+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20060720121718+08'00'", "Title": "Preparing the Energy Conservation and Resource Management Project", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "Company": "ADB"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 3 July 2006) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  yuan (CNY) \nCNY1.00 =  $0.1251 \n$1.00 =  CNY7.9943 \n \nThe exchange rate of the yuan is determined in relation to a weighted basket of currencies of the \ntrading partners of the People\u2019s Republic of China.
