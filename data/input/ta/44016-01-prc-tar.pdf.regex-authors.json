The proposed technical assistance (TA)1 is included in the aide memoire of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) country programming midterm review mission 2010. The proposed TA \nis aligned with the 2009 Energy Policy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the greater use \nof renewable energy, and also addresses the key pillars of the country partnership strategy \n(2008\u20132010). The proposed TA aims at enhancing the capacity of large-scale grid-connected \nsolar photovoltaic (PV) system development in Qinghai Province. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The 14th Session of the Standing Committee of the 10th National People\u2019s Congress in \nFebruary of 2005 enacted the Renewable Energy Law of the PRC, which provides a feed-in \ntariff  for  some  renewable  technologies,  specifies  grid-feed  in  requirements  and  standard \nprocedures, and establishes incentives and supervisory measures for promoting renewable \nenergy  development.  Both  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  for  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment and the 11th Five-Year Plan for Energy Development encourage the diffusion of \nrenewable energy and increasing its share in the total primary energy mix. In 2007, the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission issued the Medium and Long-Term Development Plan \nfor Renewable Energy in the PRC, which aims to increase the share of renewable energy to \n10%  by  2010,  and  to  15%  by  2020.  In  November  2009,  the  State  Council  of  the  PRC \nannounced that it planned to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic \nproduct by 40%\u201345% by 2020 compared with 2005 levels.  \n \n3.   Increasing the share of renewable energy to attain the targeted energy mix by 2020 will \nalso reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The share of renewable energy of the total primary \nenergy mix has increased steadily, from 7% in 2005 to 9% in 2009, and is likely to reach the \ntarget of 10% in 2010. However, the growth of all renewable energy sources has not been \nuniform. While wind power increased from 1.3 gigawatts (GW) in 2005 to 25 GW by 2009, solar \npower has grown more slowly2 because of its high unit cost of power generation.   \n \n4.  Creating a domestic market for solar PV to attain the 20 GW national target by 2020 \nremains a challenge. The PRC has great potential for solar energy, with more than 5,000 \nmegajoules per square meter (MJ/m2) of annual solar radiation and more than 2,000 hours\u2019 \naverage sunshine in two-thirds of the country. Solar cell production in the PRC has been \ngrowing rapidly since 2004 and reached 4,100 megawatts (MW) in 2009, making it the largest \nproducer of solar cell in the world. However, the installed capacity of solar PV is still only 1.5% \nof the 20 GW target by 2020. Because the domestic solar PV market is small, more than 98%, \nor 4,011 MW, of solar cell production in the PRC is exported to Europe, Japan, and the United \nStates.3 But the domestic market for solar PV is expected to grow with government support. The \ngovernment launched the first concession program for a 10 MW class grid-connected solar PV \nsystem in Dunghuang, Gansu Province, in 2009, and initiated the nationwide grid-connected \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 August 2010. \n2  Installed capacities of wind, solar PV, hydro, and biomass in 2009 are 25 GW, 0.3 GW, 197 GW, and 3.2 GW, \nrespectively, while that of target capacity in 2010 and in 2020 are 5 GW (150 GW in 2020), 0.3 GW (20 GW in \n2020), 190 GW (300 GW in 2020), and 5.5 GW (30 GW in 2020).   \n3  Lian Zipeng. 2010. Status and Policies of PV in China. National Energy Authority. Beijing. \n ", "2   \nsolar PV concession program with 280 MW total installed capacity4 in 2010. The government \nalso launched the \u201cGolden Sun\u201d program5 in 2009, providing subsidies for the capital investment \ncosts of solar PV power plant construction, including grid-connected installation to accelerate \ncommercial-based solar PV development. Since 2009, the offtake tariff of solar PV power \ngeneration has declined due to a competitive concession bidding program.6 The government \nestimates the generation cost of solar PV will be reduced by 8% per annum with domestic \nmarket growth, and will achieve grid parity by 2020.7  \n \n 5.  Developing a stable grid-connected renewable energy system is another huge challenge \nin the PRC. Only 72% of total wind capacity is connected to the grid8 due to variations in power \noutput because of the intermittent nature of wind. This output variation could decrease the \naccuracy of load forecast, affect grid dispatching and operation, and have a negative impact on \nthe quality of the electricity supply and on grid stability. Solar energy, which has similarly \nfluctuating natural cycles over a short time scale, will also face output variation problems as the \nshare of solar energy fed into the grid increases. Controlling power output variation remains \nimperative for large-scale grid-connected solar PV.    \n \n6.  Qinghai Province, which is located in the northeastern part of the Qinghai\u2013Xizang9 \nplateau in western PRC, has abundant mineral and natural resources, while its gross regional \ndomestic product (GRDP) is the second lowest of all the provinces in the PRC.10 To enhance \neconomic development by utilizing these resources in an environmentally sustainable manner, \nthe Qinghai provincial government has set a development agenda for promoting solar energy, \nwhich would supply clean electricity to the load center in the eastern part of the PRC, and for \ndeveloping a solar PV-related supply-chain industry, utilizing more than 20 GW of solar power \nresource potential11 and the rich silica resources12 in the province.  \n \n7.     Qinghai Province launched a large-scale grid-connected solar PV development program \nin 2009. However, limited access to advanced technology solutions to control output variation, \n                                                 \n4  Concession tender, for 280 MW solar PV installation with a 25-year concession period, began in June 2010 and \nbidding opened in August 2010. Fifty companies participated in the bid. The concession program has two projects \nin Qinghai, with 50 MW installed capacity in total.   \n5  The program was initiated with the collaboration of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Science and Technology, \nand the National Energy Administration. The program provides 50% capital subsidies for grid-connected solar PV, \nand 70% for stand-alone solar PV, to be installed in remote areas with no access to electricity. Around 300 projects \nhave already been proposed under the program, totaling 640 MW installation capacity and CNY20 billion in \ninvestments.   \n6  According to Article 19 of the Renewable Energy Law, the state council sets benchmark tariffs (approved tariff \nlevels) for grid-connected renewable energy on the basis of concession bidding. While the average approved tariff \nin 2009 was CNY1.50 per kWh, a tariff of CNY1.15 per kWh was approved in April 2010 for grid-connected solar \nPV projects with 40 MW installed capacity in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The lowest bid price (on \n10 August 2010) for a 280 MW grid-connected solar PV concession program was CNY0.73 per kWh.  \n7  According to Lian Zipeng (2010), the generation cost of solar PV is expected to be competitive with that of fossil-\nfuel-based power by 2020. The government assumes that the generation cost of solar PV per kWh will decline from \nCNY1.50 in 2009 to CNY0.6 in 2020.  \n8  Xina  Xie  and  Michael  Economides.  2009.  Great  Leap  Forward  for  China\u2019s  Wind  Energy.  EnergyTribune. \n30 July. http://www.energytribune.com/articles.cfm?aid=2139 \n9  Also known as Tibet Autonomous Region. \n10 Qinghai\u2019s GRDP was CNY96 billion in 2008. In terms of household expenditure, per-capita consumption of urban \nand rural households in 2008 was CNY8,192 (lowest of all the provinces) and CNY2,896 (the fifth-lowest of all the \nprovinces), respectively.   \n11 Installed capacity of solar PV in Qinghai was only 7 MW in 2009.  \n12 Silica provides the raw material of polysilicon for solar cells and semiconductors. Confirmed silica reserves amount \nto over 1 billion tons. Polysilicon production in Qinghai has reached 1,000 tons per year, and will be expanded by \n6,000 tons per year, around 5% and 33%, respectively, of total domestic production in the PRC in 2009. ", "  3\nlack of personnel experience in grid-connected solar PV system design, and limited incentives \nto expand large-scale solar PV plant investment, have slowed development of solar power. The \nproposed TA aims to increase the capacity of grid-connected solar PV system development in \nQinghai Province, by (i) introducing advanced technologies to lower barriers for development; \n(ii) enhancing local capacity in planning, design, construction, supply chain, and operation and \nmaintenance (O&M); (iii) improving the design of 10 MW class grid-connected solar PV pilot \nplants; and (iv) improving provincial government policy for solar PV development in Qinghai \nProvince.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be accelerated deployment of grid-connected solar PV plants \nin Qinghai Province. The outcome of the TA will be lowered capacity barriers in the planning, \ndesign, construction, and O&M of grid-connected solar PV development in Qinghai Province. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The key outputs of the TA include:  \n(i)  Holding seminars to introduce advanced technology for grid-connected solar PV \nsystems;  and  introducing  internationally  advanced  power  conditioner \ntechnologies,  including  a  master  control  and  monitoring  (MCM)  system  for \ncontrolling power output variation of the 10 MW class grid-connected solar PV.  \n(ii)  Preparing  a  technical  guidance  note  to  strengthen  capacity  in  the  planning, \ndesign, construction, and O&M of a grid-connected solar PV system; assessing \nthe capacity of potential resources, planning, system design, construction, O&M, \nand supply chain; and conducting capacity development training.  \n(iii)  Improving the design of a pilot grid-connected solar PV plant. Reviewing the \ndesign of the pilot 10 MW class grid-connected solar PV system in terms of its \ntechnical and financial feasibility.  \n(iv)  Preparing  a  policy  note,  including  key  findings  and  recommendations;  and \norganizing a workshop to disseminate information about grid-connected solar PV \nsystem development to provinces with large-scale grid-connected PV potential.  \n \n10.   The main assumptions are (i) maintained government priorities and preferential tariffs \nfor grid-connected solar PV development, and (ii) the active participation of relevant counterpart \nstaff in capacity development tasks. The main risks are (i) low offtake electricity tariffs, which \nundermine sustainable investment in grid-connected solar PV development; and (ii) that TA \nrecommendation  will  not  be  agreed  to  and  endorsed  by  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies. There are no issues and risks associated with the social and environmental safeguard \naspects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA will cost $840,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be financed by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $200,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Multi-Donor  Clean  Energy  Fund13 under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing \n                                                 \n13 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden.  \n ", "4   \nPartnership Facility, and administered by ADB on a front-load basis14.
