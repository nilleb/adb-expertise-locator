INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Pakistan formally requested, through its Economic Affairs Division \n(EAD), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank to undertake the Post-Conflict \nNeeds Assessment (PCNA). Key government stakeholders, including the EAD; Office of Chief \nSecretary;  North  West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP);  NWFP  Provincial  Disaster  Management \nAuthority/Provincial  Reconstruction,  Rehabilitation  and  Settlement  Authority;  and  Federally \nAdministered Tribal Areas1 (FATA) Secretariat have been consulted and fully support the project. \nNo fact-finding mission was fielded.  However, agreement was reached with the government on \nthe technical assistance (TA) purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, and financing. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  FATA is a narrow belt along the Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan border. It consists of seven \nagencies  and  six  bordering  frontier  regions  and  is  of  immense  geostrategic  and  political \nimportance.  Although  directly  administered  by  the  federal  government,  its  people  maintain \nstrong kinship alliances and economic linkages with neighboring Afghanistan. Development in \nFATA significantly lags behind development in the adjoining settled districts of the NWFP and \nthe country as a whole. FATA has the highest incidence of rural poverty in Pakistan. The NWFP \nis the third-largest province in Pakistan, both in terms of population and its contribution to the \nnational economy. Much of its population hovers near the poverty line, and the local economy \nhas performed below its potential due to various geopolitical and developmental constraints in \nthe region.  \n \n3.  In early 2009 the government\u2014with the consensus of its political, administrative, and \nmilitary leadership, as well as the international community\u2014initiated military operations in parts \nof FATA and the NWFP. This action resulted in an internal migration of colossal proportions \nfrom the embattled areas. Estimates are that 2 million people have been internally displaced. In \naddition  to  the  economic  costs  and  livelihood  disruptions,  the  conflict  has  damaged  local \ninstitutions  and  undermined  the  general  social  fabric  in  the  affected  areas.  Recently  the \ngovernment lifted restrictions on the return of internally displaced persons (IDPs), and the vast \nmajority of the initial wave of IDPs have returned. With similar military operations under way in \nother locations in FATA and the NWFP, the number of IDPs is again beginning to increase. The \ngovernment has initiated an early recovery process to address the initial needs of returning \nIDPs and reestablish its administrative control in the affected areas, which are progressively and \nslowly rebounding from major conflict.  \n \n4.  The government requested ADB and the World Bank to undertake and lead a rapid \ndamage and needs assessment2 (DNA) for short- to medium-term recovery in the seven most \nconflict-affected districts and agencies of the NWFP and FATA. The DNA has developed initial \nestimates for reconstructing and rehabilitating damaged infrastructure to restore livelihoods and \npriority  services;  ensure  some  semblance  of  normality  in  basic  governance  structure;  and \nprovide the much-needed cash injection into the affected areas. This is necessary to secure the \narea,  prevent  further  conflict,  and  provide  an  environment  conducive  to  sustained  peace, \nsecurity, and development in the affected areas. The government officially launched the DNA on \n16 November 2009. Preliminary DNA estimates of sectoral needs amount to $1.08 billion. Relief \n                                                 \n1 FATA comprises seven agencies\u2014Bajaur, Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand, Orakzai, North Waziristan, and South \nWaziristan and the frontier regions of Bannu, D. I. Khan, Kohat, Lakki, Peshawar, and Tank. \n2  ADB and World Bank. 2009. Pakistan NWFP and FATA; Preliminary Damage and Needs Assessment. Islamabad.  \n ", "2   \nassistance is being provided by various international organizations including the United Nations \nHigh  Commission  for  Refugees,  the  World  Food  Programme,  and  other  bi-laterals  and \ninternational non-government organizations. However, assistance is considered inadequate to \ncover immediate needs. \n \n5.  While the DNA is a crucial step towards addressing the more immediate crisis-recovery \nneeds, it represents only the initial stage of the longer recovery and peace-building process. \nThe DNA alone is insufficient for identifying necessary measures in the medium and long term \nto reduce the risk of relapse into conflict. A comprehensive framework to manage conflict risk is \nneeded to build upon the early recovery phase by meeting the development needs of the area \nand averting future conflicts. It is with this intention that the government formally requested ADB \nand the World Bank to initiate and lead the PCNA. \n \n6.  The TA will support the PCNA by developing a comprehensive framework to mitigate \nsuch underlying conflict-inducing development factors as social inequity, endemic poverty, and \nweak governance, as well as to address the critical longer-term strategic objectives of promoting \nsustainable  peace-building,  lasting  security,  economic  development  and  growth,  improved \nsocial service delivery, and the protection of human rights. Moreover, under the international \nprinciples of engagement and support for longer-term post-conflict recovery, the objectives of \nlonger-term  international  development  assistance  are  to  provide  the  affected  and  larger \npopulation with an early peace dividend, address the developmental causes of conflict, and \nassist in restoring stable and just structures in the country. The PCNA will prepare a technical \nassessment  of  recovery  needs  and  develop  a  post-conflict  transition  strategy,  including \nestablishing  a  platform  for  local  and  national  stakeholders  and  the  international  donor \ncommunity to agree on joint priorities, define their resource commitments, and prepare their \nactivities. \n \n7.  A core donor coordination team (DCT) comprising ADB, World Bank, United Nations, \nand European Community has been established to jointly undertake the PCNA. The four DCT \nmembers  have  agreed  that  the  project  will  follow  international  norms  and  guidelines  of \ncollaboration  between  multilaterals  established  under  the  Joint  Declaration  on  Post-Crisis \nNeeds Assessments and Recovery Planning3 signed by all key multilaterals. The PCNA will also \nensure consistency with the, international protocols,4 ADB guidelines5 and commitments related \nto post conflict needs assessments in fragile states.6 Given the importance of the links between \npolitical, security, and development objectives in a post-conflict situation, the DCT is discussing \nstrategic issues with the military\u2019s special support group. Coordination with the military will \ncontinue during the PCNA and its implementation, apart from consultations with the group as \nstakeholders. The exact scope of activities in each stage will be negotiated among the DCT \nmembers throughout the PCNA process. There has been preliminary agreement among the \nDCT  members  as  to  which  part  of  the  PCNA  they  will  finance.  Some  aspects  of  PCNA \npreparation, such as coordination and management, and major crosscutting themes and sectors \nare likely to be supported by several DCT members depending upon the scope.  At this initial \nstage, the UN is financing the establishment costs of the PCNA Secretariat, while the World \n                                                 \n3 European Commission, UN Development Group, World Bank, 2008.

The TA directly affects Pakistan\u2019s development priorities and the implementation of the \ncountry partnership strategy. The effects of previous and ongoing military operations and the \ninsurgency on national security and the economy, social and administrative structures, the \ndelivery of basic services, and the overall security environment has jeopardized the country\u2019s \ndevelopment. With interest from the highest tiers of the government, including the President and \nPrime Minister of Pakistan, and with the minister of the EAD spearheading the process, political \nownership is well established. The Prime Minister chairs the strategic oversight council of the \nPCNA, which has representation from all key stakeholders in the NWFP and FATA.  \n \n9.  The ADB program cannot be implemented in the affected areas until security conditions \nimprove. Indeed, ADB operations in the country are at risk as long as the situation in conflict-\naffected areas is not addressed because of the possibility that the current insecure environment \ncould envelop the entire country. Thus, the goal and objectives of the PCNA are consistent with \nthe development objective of the country partnership strategy of supporting Pakistan\u2019s efforts to \nproduce sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. ADB has vast regional experience \nin working with other multilateral partners in post-disaster and post-conflict situations, including \npost-earthquake assistance to Pakistan; post-tsunami assistance to Indonesia; and post-conflict \nassistance to Sri Lanka, East Timor, and Georgia. The TA is consistent with the ADB profile in \nPakistan and the importance of its portfolio there. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact of the PCNA is the creation of enabling conditions for sustainable \nand  peaceful  development  in  conflict-affected  areas.  The  PCNA  aims  to  overcome  the \nconsequences of conflict by establishing agreed social, economic, and development priorities, \nas well as articulating their financial implications on the basis of an overall long-term vision. This \ncan bring economic recovery and peace to the affected areas.  \n11.  The expected outcome is the development of a framework to manage conflict risk, \nharmonizing the DNA and PCNA recommendations with the long-term development needs of \nthe  affected  areas,  including  developing  strategies  to  overcome  the  consequences  of  the \nconflict by identifying social, economic, and development priorities.  \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  has  two  key  outputs:  (i)  a  finalized  PCNA  including  a  transitional  results \nframework and funding commitments for its implementation, guided by a comprehensive crisis \nanalysis,  report  on  development  deficits,  sector  analyses,  and  communication  strategy  for \ndissemination of the PCNA; and (ii) a capacity assessment of local and national institutions and \ninitial support to enable them to effectively respond to and recover from the current crisis, \nmanage any future crisis, and strengthen their capacity to integrate crisis assessments into local \nand national policies, strategies, and budgets. \n \n13.  Key TA activities are the following: \n \n ", "4   \n(i)  A crisis analysis will assess (a) the history of the conflict and important background \nfactors, including regional aspects; (b) the key factors contributing to conflict and \npeace, including root causes and escalating and deescalating factors; (c) the main \nactors in the conflict and their interests, positions, and capacities; (d) the security \nsituation and its implications for the PCNA; and (e) trends in the peace process and \nfuture scenarios. \n \n(ii)  A  development  deficit  analysis  will  include  (a)  consolidated  quantitative  and \nqualitative information, and (b) gender indicators and disaggregated district data from \nvarious  sources  on  development  deficits  in  FATA  and  the  NWFP  regarding \ninfrastructure, service delivery, human development, etc. \n \n(iii)  The  PCNA  will  conduct  sector  and  subsector  assessments  of  the  following: \ngovernance  (including  public  administration,  police  and  the  judiciary),  housing, \neducation, health and social protection, agriculture and natural resources (including \nirrigation), industry and mining, tourism, transport, energy, and water supply. The TA \nwill examine the sectors and subsectors in which ADB has a comparative advantage: \neducation, water supply and urban services, energy, irrigation, transportation, and \ntourism.  The  assessments  will  address  the  crosscutting themes  of  environment, \ngender,  and  broader  institutional  capacities.  This  component  includes  (a)  an \ninception workshop to review key results of the pre-assessment and agree on a \nmethodology  and  timeline  for  the  main  assessment;  (b)  sector  data  collection, \nconsultations, and analysis; (c) sector report drafting; (d) sector validation workshops \nwith sector stakeholders; and (e) finalizing the sector reports and developing and \ncosting the transitional results framework. \n \n(iv)  Strategic  communications  will  focus  on  developing  (a)  a  comprehensive  and \nmultistage  communications  strategy  for  the  PCNA  and  peace  building  ensuring \ninclusiveness and outreach to women and men; (b) progressive public disclosure of \npre-assessment and assessment findings; (c) website development and outreach to \nnational  and  subnational  stakeholders;  and  (d)  the  development  of  public \ninformation, sensitization, and behavioral-change campaigns.  \n \n(v)  To address institutional capacity constraints on human resources, managerial skills, \nand monitoring and evaluation systems, the TA will conduct an analysis of national \nand local implementing capacity and a gender sensitive assessment of capacity-\nbuilding  needs.  The  assessment  will  identify  immediate  capacity-building \ninterventions  and  develop  medium  to  long-term  plans  for  (a)  improving  human \nresources,  (b)  improving  the  management  skills  of  administrative  staff,  and  (c) \nstrengthening mechanisms of financial control and reporting, with particular attention \nto capacities that can promote nonviolent, inclusive and gender sensitive conflict \nresolution. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,000,000 equivalent. The government has \nrequested ADB to finance $800,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014other sources).  The government will finance \nthe balance of the cost, equivalent to $200,000, through the provision of in-kind contribution in \nthe form of staff, logistic and operational costs. The government has assured that such in-kind \n ", "  5\ncontribution will be available as required according to the implementation schedule of the TA.  \nDetails of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The executing agency will be the PCNA Secretariat, which has been tasked by the \ngovernment to develop and manage recovery and reconstruction efforts in the affected areas. \nThe  PCNA  Secretariat  consists  of  representatives  from  the  NWFP  through  the  Provincial \nDisaster Management Authority and from FATA through the FATA Secretariat.  The PCNA is \nunder the direct supervision of the chief secretary NWFP and FATA, as chairperson of the \nPCNA steering committee. \n \n16.  The TA will be administered by ADB through PRM. It will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s safeguards policy requirements specified in the Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy.7 The TA will be implemented over 15 months commencing in December 2009, with \ncompletion expected by March 2011. It requires 93 person-months of consultant inputs (13 \nperson-months of international and 80 person-months national), along with 100 person-months \nof field enumerator services (Appendix 3). The consulting services will be required to (i) provide \ninputs to all phases of the PCNA, with the main focus on the assessment phase, and (ii) \nconduct a comprehensive capacity assessment and plan to strengthen the capacity of key \ndistrict  and  provincial  agencies.  Individual  consultants,  managed  by  an  independent  team \nleader, will be recruited to provide the consulting services needed for this TA.  This modality is \nappropriate to ensure a degree of flexibility in inputs given the nature of the PCNA process and \nbecause the inputs are in very distinct areas of expertise that may not be readily available \nthrough a firm. With four multilaterals supporting the PCNA process, diversity of issues and \nongoing nature of the conflict, variations in the requirements for consultants and negations \nbetween multilaterals to fill these requirements are expected to continue through the PCNA \nprocess. This flexibility may not be available through firms. As most of the inputs are from \nnational consultants, there is no value addition provided by recruitment through a firm. Survey \nand media firms will be contracted through fixed budget selection. All procurement will be \nundertaken using ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n17.  The  government  contribution  will be  in  the  form  of  staff  from  the  NWFP  provincial \ngovernment and the FATA Secretariat as counterpart support to sector and geographic teams \nand for collecting and validating data. In addition, if the security situation allows, housing for \nPCNA consultants will provided by the government of the NWFP and the FATA Secretariat in \nPeshawar.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for the Post-Conflict Needs Assessment, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2004.

Scope of Work \n1.  The  expected  impact,  outcome,  and  outputs  of  the  Post-Conflict  Needs  Assessment \n(PCNA) are identified in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The technical \nassistance  (TA)  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  Disaster  and  Emergency \nAssistance Policy1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Consulting services will be required \nto (i) provide inputs in all phases of the PCNA, with greater focus on the assessment phase, and \n(ii)  conduct  a  comprehensive  capacity  assessment  and  develop  a  plan  to  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  key  administrative  and  sector  departments  and  agencies  in  the  Federally \nAdministered Tribal Areas and the North West Frontier Province. The TA will also undertake \ninitial capacity building.  \n \n2.  Most TA resources will be used in the assessment stage, as the pre-assessment stage \nis fairly advanced and should be completed by mid-January 2010. As the work plan, scope, \ndesign, and related resource requirements for the assessment stage will be agreed during the \ncurrent  pre-assessment  stage,  it  is  not  possible  at  this  point  to  determine  the  exact \nrequirements needed during assessment stage. However, some of the tasks to be undertaken \nduring  the  assessment  stage  include  (i)  developing  approaches  for  expanded  and  more \ninclusive decision making and conflict resolution to attain common needs, including improved \nservices, the resumption of sustainable livelihoods, economic development in the affected areas, \nand institutional resources in the context of changing local government responsibilities; (ii) \nassessing and developing selected sectors for ADB support (It is expected that there will be \naround 20 sector, subsector, and thematic studies carried out, and ADB is expected to lead 5\u20138 \nsectors and subsectors mainly related to infrastructure, where it has comparative advantage); \nand  (iii)  developing  a  coordination,  communication,  and  consultation  process  to  guide  the \npreparation, validation, and finalization of the PCNA, as well as recommend approaches to \ninstitutionalize  more  effective  communication  channels  among  communities;  internal  and \nexternal stakeholders; and local, provincial, and federal administrations.  \n \n3.  Accordingly, TA activities have been delineated into three interrelated clusters. The \nconsultants will operate within these three clusters with coordinated contributions, as follows.  \n \n4.  Governance and planning support. Activities under this cluster include the overall \nplanning and coordination support to be provided by a team leader and planning specialist, who \nwill lead the planning process of the PCNA, and the three teams supported by the TA. The \nconsultants under this cluster will provide inputs to analyze the key crosscutting themes of the \ncrisis and their relationship and impact on social, political, economic, and social development in \ncrisis-affected  areas.  Possible  international  and  national  expertise  could  include  (i)  public \nadministration and the judiciary; (ii) institutional development; (iii) planning, monitoring, and \nevaluation; (iv) crisis analysis; (v) financial management and budgeting; (vi) safeguards; and (vii) \ngender. The terms of reference and level of effort for these inputs will be finalized through \nmutual consultation with the DCT after the pre-assessment stage. The distribution of tasks will \ndepend upon the comparative advantages of multilaterals leading this exercise. The key outputs \nof this cluster will include (i) stakeholder mapping and analysis; (ii) analysis of social, economic, \npolitical, state, regional, and global aspects of the crisis using secondary data, independent \nexperts, and stakeholder consultation; (iii) the design of the consultation process; (iv) crisis \nanalysis report; (v) terms of reference for the strategic framework of the assessment phase \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila.   \n ", "12  Appendix 3   \n \n(sector and geographic scope) and timeline and phases of the transitional results framework \n(TRF); and (vi) agreed frameworks of social safeguards, incubational arrangements, monitoring, \nand  financial management.  \n \n5.  Technical and sector support. The cluster will focus on sector assessments and their \nprioritization, as well as developing the TRF. This will include a review of the baseline data; a \ndeficit analysis, including coverage, service-delivery gaps, causes, solutions; and an inter-sector \nanalysis for prioritization. This will be done through surveys; consultations; and taking into \naccount information and studies already available, including the damage and needs assessment, \nconflict early recovery initial needs assessment, government plans, United States assistance \nplan, etc. Possible international and national expertise required for these activities include \nspecialists and a field team to prepare (i) the assessments for education, energy, irrigation, \ntransport,  social  protection,  water  supply  and  urban  services,  and  tourism  (especially \necotourism); and (ii) the assessment of selective crosscutting environment considerations. The \nselected sectors are based on the current understanding of sectors where ADB has the interest \nand depth to provide leadership. The level of effort and terms of reference of the specialists will \nbe finalized by the sector teams, and the extent of work will depend upon the studies and \nsecondary data already available in a particular sector. The key outputs of this cluster will \ninclude  (i)  well-defined  terms  of  reference  and  resource  requirements  for  each  sector,  (ii) \nbaseline  data  and  reports  from  a  comprehensive  development  deficit  analysis, (iii)  a  well-\ndocumented  consultation  and  validation  process  in  the  priority  sectors,  (iv)  a  detailed \nassessment of priority sectors, and (v) a finalized TRF. \n  \n6.  Coordination,  operations,  and  communications  support.  The cluster focuses on \ncoordination,  communication,  operations,  consultation,  and  validation  activities  of  the  DCT \nduring the course of the PCNA. This will include support for conducting surveys, workshops, \ntrainings, dissemination, media events, and similar activities as needed and according to the \nPCNA work plan. National experts required to undertake these activities will include (i) a liaison \nand logistics coordinator, (ii) a secretariat facilitation assistant, (iii) a communications advisor, (iv) \npeer review and advisory group coordinators and resource persons, (v) community development \nand liaison specialists, and (vi) a consultations facilitator. Some tasks are likely to be outsourced \nto a communications firm.  The key outputs of this clusters will include (i) a well-designed \ncommunication strategy and its implementations both for external and internal stakeholders, \nresulting in wide dissemination, effective communication, census building, and behavior change \nin stakeholders; (ii) clearly defined roles and responsibilities of PCNA core and subgroups, \nincluding  the  PCNA  secretariat;  (iii)  a  well-established,  clearly  understood  coordination \nmechanism  for  agencies  involved  in  the  PCNA;  (iv)  a  professionally  facilitated  and  well-\ndocumented consultation process with stakeholders; and (v) a functional and efficient peer-\nreview mechanism in place to facilitate the PCNA.  \n \n7.  It is estimated that 13 person-months of international consultancy and 80 person-months \nof national consultancy will be required. The three clusters will also require approximately 100 \nperson-months of field enumerators for data collection and surveys. However, the level of effort \nwill be adjusted based on the outcome of the pre-assessment and the security environment, as \nrequired during the PCNA. \n \nB.  Schedule  \n  \n8.  It is anticipated that the consultants will mobilize in December 2009. Most will complete \ntheir assignments by December 2010. Some consulting inputs will be required to continue \ncapacity building in districts and provinces, which should be completed around March 2011. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20091221093211+05'00'", "Author": "INL", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0.1 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20100225154927+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - Final PCNA TA Paper - 10 Dec 2009 edited CLEAN FINAL_OSEC-OGC cleared..doc"}}
