Outputs \ninclude (i) improved floodways (2,850 meters [m]); (ii) rehabilitated \nexisting drains (2,425 m); (iii) installation of water gauges to for \nflood  monitoring  and  establish  survey  levels  to  support  future \nmaster planning and drainage design; (iv) design, construction, \nand operation of a wastewater collection and treatment system for \nthe central business area (CBA) (a treatment plant with a capacity \nof  950  cubic  meters/day,  and  approximately  5  kilometers  of \nsewers); (v) upgrading of individual sanitation facilities in low-lying \nareas,  particularly  southwest  of  the  CBA,  and  utility-managed \nindividual  sanitation  systems,  specifically  a  regular  pump-out \nprogram for septic tanks and cesspools; and (vi) strengthened \ninstitutions  and  legislative  frameworks  for  wastewater \nmanagement, drainage, urban management, and environmental \nmonitoring. \n \nRationale  Apia is the  capital of Samoa and its population and economic \ncenter. It has approximately 37% of the population of 164,217 \n(based on the 1999 census), or 60,000 people. Apia, particularly \nits  center,  shows  typical  signs  of  inadequate  planning  and \ninfrastructure  provision  for  environmental  protection  associated \nwith  urban  areas.  Nearshore  marine  water  and  urban  stream \nwater quality in Apia has been significantly degraded as a result of \ninadequate  sanitation  and  wastewater  management  systems. \nMost wastewater is now treated in individual systems such as \ncesspools  and  septic  systems  before  being  discharged  into \ndrainage channels (including open channels and streams), soil, \nand groundwater. Flooding is frequent due to high rainfall and an \ninadequate drainage system that is compounded by land filling, \nblocking of drains, and historical lack of town planning. Flooding \nafter heavy rain is intensified, and foul water flooding poses a \npublic  health  risk  due  to  septage  and  latrine  wastes  being \nreleased to the ground surface environment. Businesses have \nsuffered substantially financial losses from the frequent flooding, \nhampering  the  overall  economic  growth  of  the  country.  The \ngrowing urban population density, poor soil conditions, and high \ngroundwater, together with flooding potential, mean that individual \nsystems in the denser urban areas can no longer effectively treat \nwastewater.  A  large  reticulated  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment system covering all the urban area or even a large part ", "ii   \ntreatment system covering all the urban area or even a large part \nof it are not affordable for the Government or the consumers. \nLimited  institutional  and  technical  capacity  also  hinder  the \npotential to operate and maintain such a system at this time. The \nSamoa  Water  Authority  (SWA)  reasonably  and  effectively \nprovides water services to Apia and rural areas of the country. \nSWA has not provided wastewater or sanitation services and has \nno specific capabilities to do so in this area. SWA\u2019s skills and \ncapacities  need  to  be  upgraded  to  cover  wastewater  and \nsanitation services. The Government recognizes the urgent need \nto  urgently  address  the  wastewater  management,  including \nsanitation issue together with the integrally related and drainage \nproblems.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  this  and  other \nplanning  and  urban  management  issues  is  reflected  in  its \nPlanning and Urban Management Strategy and the creation in \n2002 of a Planning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA). \n \nObjective  The overall objective of the Project is to improve the environment \nand public health of Apia through assistance in improving urban \ninfrastructure for drainage and sanitation as well as improving \nurban  management  capacity.  The  Project  objectives  include \nimproved public health, environmental quality, and surface and \ngroundwater quality; and reduced frequency of flooding in specific \nlow-lying areas of Apia. The Project also promotes private sector \nparticipation  in  provision  of  urban  services  by  outsourcing  a \nnumber of utility services to the private sector, and advances \nprivate sector development by providing improved infrastructure \nand business environment.  \n \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $10 million, including a \nforeign exchange cost of $3.8 million (about 38% of the total) and \na local cost of $6.2 million (about 62% of the total cost).  \n   \nFinancing Plan  $ million equivalent \nForeign  Local  Total \nSources \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n       \nAsian Development Bank  3.8  4.2  8.0 \nGovernment   0.0  2.0  2.0 \n   Total   3.8  6.2  10.0 \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The loan will be SDR 5,604,000 ($8 million equivalent) from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Asian Development Fund (ADF). \nThe loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears. The interest rate charged will be 1.0% during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will re-lend a portion of tala-denominated loan \nTerms  proceeds  allocated  with  foreign  exchange  risk  borne  by  the \nGovernment for the wastewater and sanitation component to SWA \nat a 32-year term, 5-year grace period, and interest charged at 5% \nper annum. ", "  iii \nPeriod of Utilization  March 2004 to June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance \n   \nImplementation  A project steering committee has been constituted, chaired by the \nArrangements  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  MOF  and  co-chaired  by  the \nmanaging  director  of  SWA  and  CEOs  of  Ministry  of  Works, \nTransport, and Infrastructure (MWTI) and Ministry of Environment \nand  Natural  Resources.  Other  steering  committee  members \ninclude the CEOs of Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), Ministry of \nHealth  (MOH),  Ministry  of  Women,  Community  and  Social \nDevelopment; and the general manager of the Electric Power \nCorporation. \n \nThe Project will have two implementing agencies: (i) Ministry of \nWorks,  Transport,  and  Infrastructure  (MWTI)  for  the  drainage \ncomponent; and (ii) SWA for the wastewater management and \nsanitation and capacity building component.  \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Major contracts for civil \nworks costing over $1 million, and equipment purchases valued at \n$500,000 or more will be undertaken through ADB\u2019s international \ncompetitive bidding procedures (ICB), and equipment packages \nvalued at less than $500,000 will be procured following ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for international shopping. Civil works estimated to \ncost $1 million or less per package will be carried out under local \ncompetitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to ADB, and in \naccordance with government procurement laws and regulations. \nFor  LCB  packages,  local  contractors  have  the  expertise  and \ncapacity  to  undertake  such  works,  which  will  be  determined \nthrough a prequalification exercise.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The loan will fund recruitment of a firm to provide 48 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  65  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services to help the Government and SWA implement \nthe Project and provide capacity building. Project management \nunit will be staffed with a Project Manager and administrative and \naccounting services funded by the loan. \n \nSWA will also use loan funds to finance a twinning or partnership \narrangement with another regional wastewater utility, which will be \nseparately retained. \n \nThe recruitment of consultant services for the capacity building \nand Project implementation and twinning arrangement, will be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, using the quality- and cost-based selection method, \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement ", "iv   \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement \nof  domestic  consultants.  The  PMU  Project  Manager  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, as an individual consultant with an allowance for \naccounting and administrative services. \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project will improve environmental conditions, reduce health \nBeneficiaries  risks,  and  greater  amenities  to  Apia\u2019s  60,000  residents, \napproximately 2,000 working population, and 50,000 visitors. The \nProject  will  directly  benefit  residents  by  providing  sanitation \nservices. A proportion of the 1,750 residents of low-lying areas will \nbenefit from rehabilitation of their household sanitation facilities to \na minimum standard. Businesses, government departments, and \nother organizations located in CBA will benefit from connection to \nthe central reticulated sewerage system. The upgraded sanitation \nservices  for  the  National  Hospital  will  benefit  the  10,000  in-\npatients  and  50,000  outpatients  annually,  hospital  and \nDepartment of Health staff (approximately 130), and the adjacent \nvillage  community.  The  Malifa  compound  population  of \napproximately 2,200 students, staff, and Department of Education \nstaff  will  benefit  from  improved  sanitation.  Residents  and \nbusinesses will benefit from improved drainage. These benefits \ninclude less disruption to roadways and footpaths during and after \nrainfall, less water damage to roadways and footpaths, and litter \nentering Apia harbor and neighboring mangrove areas. \n  \nIndirect beneficiaries of the Project include the fisheries industry \nthrough improved marine environment resources from reduction in \nseawater pollution, and the tourism industry through improved \nurban and marine environments. \n \nStaff of PUMA, MWTI, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of \nHealth will upgrade their skills and capabilities through training. \nSWA  staff  will  benefit  from  a  twinning  arrangement  with  an \nexperienced wastewater utility. The Government will benefit from \nimproved environmental and health outcomes, and reductions in \nhealth expenditure in relation to water-related diseases. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Project risks center on (i) continued government commitment to \nimprove urban management, (ii) business community participation \nin the sewerage connection program, and (iii) effectiveness and \nsustainability  of  capacity-building  measures.  Government \ncommitment has been demonstrated through the establishment of \nPUMA, promulgation of the Planning and Urban Management Bill, \nand efforts to develop this Project. Business community support \nand participation were fostered through dialogue during project \ndevelopment,  and  continue  to  be  fostered  through  pre-loan \ndialogue  on  tariff  needs  and  private  sector  participation \nwastewater  service  provision.  To  make  capacity  building \nmeasures more effective and sustainable, the capacity building \nconsultancy  emphasize  a  high  level  of  interaction  with  the \nGovernment and SWA staff during the Project. The establishment ", "  v\nGovernment and SWA staff during the Project. The establishment \nand  funding  of  a  twinning  arrangement  for  SWA  and  a  well-\nestablished and effective utility will promote long-term capacity \nbuilding. There is some risk of inadequate cost recovery  from \ntariffs resulting in greater-than-anticipated government subsidy of \nwastewater management operations. However, the Government \nand SWA have demonstrated their commitment to improved cost \nrecovery through recent water tariff increases, enactment of a \nPublic Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act that promotes \nsustainable commercial operations for public enterprises, and its \ndeliberate  review  of  cost  recovery  issues  associated  with  this \nProject.  Also,  based  on  project  estimates  and  consultations, \nestimated tariffs. Government has provided strong assurances on \ntariff systems and levels as well as support of SWA when it \nprovides necessary community services that are not commercially \nviable (community service obligations). The Project emphasizes \nbuilding  community  and  other  stakeholder  awareness  and \ncommitment  to  the  Project,  and  encouraging  SWA  and \ngovernment  responsiveness  to  community  needs.  Land \nacquisition  risks,  which  only  affect  portions  of  the  drainage \ncomponent,  are  minimal  due  to  limited  land  acquisition \nrequirements.  \n \nTechnical Assistance  Attached to the Project is a concurrent technical assistance (TA) \nfor  institutional  strengthening  of  infrastructure  planning  for  the \nProject,  and  long-term  planning  for  drainage  and  wastewater \nmanagement. The TA Executing Agency (EA) will be the Treasury \nDepartment, and the implementing agency, PUMA. The TA has \ntwo  components:  (i)  drainage  and  wastewater  management \nplanning  and  (ii)  urban  planning  and  regulation.  Long-term \ndrainage and wastewater management plans for greater Apia, and \nenabling  legislation  will  be  developed.  The  planning  and \nregulation component focuses on institutionalizing the new PUMA \nlegislation with key affected stakeholders, including PUMA, MWTI, \nand  SWA,  and  strengthening  them,  primarily  PUMA.  It  will \nfacilitate  new  planning  assessment  processes  and  procedures \nand implementation of a land planning and geographic information \nsystem (GIS) for PUMA. The TA will also help PUMA develop a \nstrategy for community awareness of wastewater and drainage \nissues. \n \nThe TA involves 11 person-months of international and 13 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants, to be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants, using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method and simplified technical \nproposal,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The total cost of the TA is \nestimated  at  $475,000,  with  $400,000  financed  by  the  Japan \nSpecial  Fund.  Expertise  areas  to  be  recruited  under  the  TA \ninclude  civil/environmental  engineering,  urban  planning, \nenvironmental law, GIS, and community development awareness.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Independent State of Samoa for the Sanitation and Drainage Project. The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Drainage and Sanitation, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Samoa is a small archipelago consisting of two main islands\u2014Upolu and Savai\u2019i\u2014and \nfive smaller islands, with a total area of 2,820 square kilometers. In 2001 the population1 was \n176,848,  with  natural  increase  in  the  order  of  1%  per  annum.  However,  with  significant \nemigration, net population growth is estimated at 0.5% as it has been for the last 30 years. \nSome 98% of the population lives on the coastal plains in small villages, including in and around \nurban Apia, the capital, on Upolu. Approximately 60,872 people or 34.4% of the population lived \nin Apia while 52% lived in northwest Upolu, including Apia and the undulating foothills stretching \n30 kilometers (km) to the northwest. Much of development is between these foothills and the \ncoastline. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Samoa has made great progress over the past two decades in economic and social \ndevelopment.  The  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa  2002\u201320042  continues  the \nGovernment\u2019s  emphasis  on  macroeconomic  stability;  public  sector  efficiency  and  reform; \nimproved education and health standards; better urban planning and management, including \nprovision of infrastructure; and a strong private sector.  \n \n4.  Samoa\u2019s stable political environment, combined with vigorous economic growth and \ninclusive  social  development  strategies,  has  contributed  towards  Samoa  achieving  its \ndevelopment  goals.  With  a  Human  Development  Index  of  0.59. Samoa rates well on the \nachievement of social development goals. Adult literacy rates for both genders (96%) and gross \nenrolment rates in primary (94%) and secondary (70%) levels are high by Pacific developing \nmember country standards. Infant mortality (22 per 1,000 births), under-5 mortality (35 per \n1,000 births), and maternal mortality (4 per 100,000 births) rate amongst the three lowest in the \nPacific region. Some 90% of the population has access to potable water. Concern for the \nenvironment is strong. New legislation, Planning and Urban Management BiIl (PUMA Bill) deals \nwith the biophysical, social, and economic environments. Drafted in 2002, it is expected to be \nenacted in December 2003.3 Real gross domestic product (GDP) was 6.5% in 2001 and 6.9% in \n2000.  Strong  economic  growth  has  been  attributed  to  development  of  commerce,  public \nadministration, hotels and restaurants, transportation and communications, construction, and \nfisheries. Economic activities and government offices are concentrated in Apia, particularly the \ncentral business area (CBA).  \n \n5.  The 2001 census data indicate that 88% of the population has access to safe sanitation, \nand World Bank data for 2002 indicate that 95% of the urban population has improved facilities.4 \nThis access to sanitation data misrepresents the public health implications of the sanitation \n                                                 \n1  Extracted from the 2001 National Population and Household Census for Samoa. \n2  Government of Samoa. 2002.

Millennium Development Goals in the Pacific. Manila. ", "2 \nstatus of many living in the urban areas. In urban Apia, for example, about 75% of households \nhave septic systems, but many are too small, rarely cleaned, and sometimes directly linked to \nthe nearest drainage channel, polluting groundwater, surface streams, and the harbor. In the \nCBA and special needs areas (those with special wastewater concerns) such as hospitals and \nmajor school compounds, less than 10% of wastewater is adequately treated. The hospital has \na poorly operating treatment plant, as do most commercial centers and government complexes. \nOthers have inadequate septic systems. The situation is exacerbated by the historical lack of \nurban management, including the absence of drainage or wastewater management plans and \nthe absence of effective town planning. Individuals have elevated their plot heights, reclaimed \nland in the mangrove area, and blocked drainage channels. The effect is a haphazard and \ncumulative nonfunctioning drainage system. Flooding after heavy rain is intensified, and foul \nwater flooding poses a health risk due to septage and latrine wastes being released to the \nsurface environment. The Health Sector Strategic Plan specifically identifies environmental \nhealth issues, including the lack of a public sewerage system and drainage problems, as \naffecting public health. The plan links recent outbreaks of dengue, incidence of diarrhea, \nrespiratory and skin diseases with the need for more intensive environmental health control.5  \n \n6.  Nearshore marine water and urban stream-water quality in Apia has been significantly \ndegraded due to inadequate sanitation and wastewater management systems. Water quality-\nmonitoring data, which have been only intermittently  collected, show definitive evidence of \nsewage contamination as evidenced by low dissolved oxygen saturation, high biochemical \noxygen  demand  (BOD),  high  total  nitrogen  concentration,  and  high  indicator  bacteria \nconcentration.6 Urban drains are often choked with litter and vegetation, foul smelling (indicating \nanaerobic conditions), and contain floating oil and sewage. Drains and natural watercourses are \ncontaminated with sewage and, occasionally, industrial waste. Monitoring is done infrequently \nand usually  result from donor-funded activities, including previous Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)-supported TA.7 Samoa has no legislative framework for environmental standards. \n \n7.  Throughout the last decade, the Government has been increasingly concerned with the \nimpact of rapid population growth and development pressures in urban areas: (i) inadequate \nurban infrastructure provision to cope with the expanding urban population; (ii) absence of an \nagreed framework and coordinated approach for urban management and planning, including \nunclear institutional arrangements; and (iii) the need to resolve land issues ( supply, tenure, and \navailability) to meet demand for housing, infrastructure development, and urban expansion. The \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda  includes  reducing  the  scope  of  government  activity  through \nrationalization, corporatization and contracting out of some services. The dramatic downsizing \nof the Ministry of Works Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI) by about 80%, and outsourcing of \nmany traditional functions are examples of this.8 Public health, environmental quality, and better \nurban planning are all incorporated into the Economic Development Strategy. Similarly, the \nTourism  Development  Plan  2002-2006  emphasizes  sustainability  (including  planning  and \ndevelopment, natural resources, waste and pollution) and appropriateness of development for \nSamoa. \n \n                                                 \n5  Health data are not in a form useful to state quantitative indicators. Thus, the Health Sector Strategic Plan is \nreferenced.  Capacity-building  components  described  elsewhere  in  the  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident address this issue. \n6  For example, fecal coliform levels in Vaiusu Bay have been measured at over 5,700 organisms per 100 milliliter \n(ml), while the United States standard for shellfish gathering is 14 organisms per 100 ml.

The  Government  started  to  provide  water  supply  services  more  efficiently  and \ncommercially by creating the Samoa Water Authority (SWA) through the Water Authority Act in \n1993. The Government is committed to the principle of  full cost recovery and autonomy of SWA \nand other government utility corporations, as expressed in the Public Bodies (Performance and \nAccountability) Act. However, the Government recognizes that full cost recovery from user \ncharges is not feasible now due to broader environmental, economic, and social objectives. The \nGovernment  thus  supports  public  utilities  through  compensation  for  Community  Service \nObligations (CSOs), i.e., services that contribute to these broader objectives.9 As costs are \ngradually recovered, CSOs will be reduced to the point where they are only used to guarantee \naccess to the poor and vulnerable. Currently, the CSOs include subsidies for a lifeline block of \nwater supply and fire protection, however, additional subsidy is necessary to support SWA. \n \n9.  Urban  infrastructure  and  services  have  traditionally  been  provided  by  national \ngovernment agencies such as the Department of Lands, Survey, and Environment (DLSE), and  \nMWTI. The social, cultural, and administrative aspects of traditional village life in Apia come \nunder the village councils for which the Ministry of Women Community and Social Development \nhas administrative responsibility.10 These agencies planned  and  provided  for  infrastructure \nrequirements  and  constituted  the  de  facto  institutional  framework  for  planning  and  urban \nmanagement before the establishment of the Planning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA) \nin 2002, and preparation of the Planning and Urban Management Strategy for Samoa, which \nwere  assisted  by  ADB  TA.  PUMA  and  the  strategy  resulted  from  extensive  stakeholder \nconsultations that showed a growing awareness of the urgent need for a coordinated and \nintegrated approach to urban planning and development.11 \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n10.  With the Government\u2019s growing concern about inadequate urban infrastructure and \ncoordination  of  development  activities  also  came  concern  at  the  community  level;  where \ncustomary lands in Apia were once not available for development, fono increasingly accepted \nthat they had to discuss land-planning options, given increasing development pressure. In 2000-\n2001 this joint concern resulted in the review of institutional arrangements for planning and \nurban management in Apia and the ensuing establishment of PUMA. Key among the issues \nraised by the community were the environmental deterioration of the urban and peri-urban \nareas, increasingly inadequate or inefficient provision of infrastructure and services, and land \ntenure problems associated with complex traditional land ownership systems and need for \ngovernment access to certain lands to provide basic services. \n \n11.  Rehabilitation and improvement of drains and floodways to mitigate regular flooding in \nthe  CBA,  markets,  and  low-lying  adjacent  areas  are  urgently  needed.  Wastewater  and \nsanitation improvements are needed to meet basic public health requirements for households \nand mitigate impacts of inadequate wastewater facilities in the CBA and other identified priority \nneeds areas. The Project takes advantage of the Government\u2019s commitment to improve urban \nmanagement and the growing community awareness to respond to the urgent drainage and \nsanitation  problems,  which  is  an  important  step  to  establish  a  fully  functioning  urban \nmanagement system. Besides the benefits of physical development, the Project also includes \n                                                 \n9  CSO legally refers to the services performed but is commonly applied to the funding of these services.

The Apia Drainage Scheme, completed in 1993, was based on 1979 fieldwork, after \nwhich land use changed substantially and urban growth increased, greatly affecting runoff and \ndrainage characteristics. Much of Apia is built on low-lying flood-prone land, parts of which were \nmangrove swamp before reclamation and development. Filling is most prominent in the natural \nfloodplain of Vaiusu Bay adjoining the CBA, with such activities continuing to change storm \nwater runoff patterns, and groundwater and flood flow patterns. The continuing lack of urban \nplanning, including lack of land-use controls and guidelines, land filling, encroachment into \nwaterways, and lack of drainage maintenance, have all contributed to the incidence of flooding \nand impact on property and health.12  \n \n13.  Previous proposals for sanitation in Apia in the mid- to late 1990s all advocated large-\nscale sanitation systems based on a reticulated system serving a minimum 10,000 population.13 \nThese  schemes  were  extensive,  covering  the  CBA,  low-lying  and  floodplain  areas,  and \nindustrial estates some 6 kilometers to the northwest. Such blanket schemes for sanitation \nfailed  to  win  government  and  other  stakeholder  support.  Large-scale  schemes  were  not \nconsidered  appropriate  because  (i)  they  were  expensive;  (ii)  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment to implement, operate, and maintain them was limited; (iii) they failed to recognize \nthe highest priority of improving the Apia water scheme and implementing water tariffs; (iv) \ndisposal to sea by ocean outfall was seen by many as resulting in adverse impacts on the \nmarine ecology and Samoa\u2019s image; and (v) the proposed sewage treatment plant sites in \nnorthwest Apia were not considered appropriate. Since 2000 the Government has reviewed \noptions that address these stakeholder issues and concerns,14 including a focus on incremental \nsewerage and drainage system development and affordable integrated solutions that meet user \ngroups\u2019 technical needs while developing the planning and urban management framework. This \nfocus is documented in the Government\u2019s Apia Planning Policy Framework. \n \n14.  ADB has invested $1.67 million in urban development and wastewater management TA. \nInitial TA recommendations failed to gain support for the reasons outlined above, while recent \nTA that have focused on consultation first and detailed design second which have been able to \ngain the necessary support.  Lessons learned from this experience and other ADB and other \ndonors are (i) consultation and dialogue among stakeholders is important in achieving project \nsupport; (ii) large-scale reticulated solutions are not appropriate at this time for several reasons \nincluding  affordability  (Government  and  consumers),  institutional  capacity,  and  technical \ncapacity; (iii) land tenure matters are an integral part of project design and implementation; (iv) \nocean  discharge  of  effluent  requires  a  high  level  of  treatment  and  long  outfall  pipes;  (v) \nwastewater  management  infrastructure  needs  to  be  improved  as  part  of  broad  urban \nmanagement planning; (vi) management needs to be included in capacity-building assistance; \nand (vii) capacity building requires long-term approaches with more time allocated to process \nand provide for long-term, distance advisory services, such as twinning arrangements. Solutions \nneed to be locally driven and respectful of the local situation, including understanding why \nprevious schemes did not win broad stakeholder support. The Project addresses these lessons \nby including multifaceted solutions. It is an appropriately scaled incremental approach that \nensures  affordability,  and  institutional  and  technical  capacity  to  support  the  Project,  while \n                                                 \n12 Appendixes 4 and 10 provide detailed data on the flooding, including technical data and economic costs. \n13  The most recent proposals were embodied in  ADB. 1994.

Although it does have reasonable water supply services capacity, SWA provides no \nwastewater or sanitation services and thus has no specific capacity in this area. Consequently, \nthe Project includes a substantial capacity-building component, which is consistent with recent \nADB Operations Evaluation Department recommendations for improving capacity building. 15  \nThe Project provides the opportunity to foster the Government\u2019s expressed goal of improving \ntransparency of CSOs, overall financial autonomy, and general governance of public utilities by \naddressing these issues for SWA under the capacity building component of the loan.  Project \nmanagement capacity building will foster the MWTI strategy to outsource works to the private \nsector. 16 \n \n16.  The Project is a part of the Government\u2019s overall strategic urban management strategy. \nIt is the first significant investment toward achieving urban environmental conditions that meet  \ninternationally recognized standards of environmental quality and Samoa standards as they are \ndeveloped. While achieving incremental environmental and drainage improvements, it provides \n(i) data needed to develop long-term physical improvement plans, and (ii) capacity building to \nsustainably provide urban services such as wastewater and drainage. \n \n17.  The Project supports ADB\u2019s strategy for Samoa17 and Water Policy by (i) fostering good \nwater and environment governance, (ii) improving living conditions, and (iii) promoting private \nsector growth and  creating jobs through private sector participation in providing wastewater \nservices  and  improving  environmental  infrastructure.  The  emphasis  on  integrated  water \nresource management, which is promoted through capacity building, support for PUMA, and \npromotion of regional cooperation by establishing a utility twinning arrangement, supports ADB\u2019s \nWater Policy. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n18.  The overall objective of the Project is to help improve Apia\u2019s environment and public \nhealth  through  improved  drainage  and  sanitation  infrastructure  and  capacity  in  urban \nmanagement. Project objectives include (i) improved public health, (ii) improved environmental \nquality, (iii) improved surface and groundwater quality, and (iv) reduced frequency of flooding in \nspecific low-lying areas. The Project also promotes private sector participation in the provision \nof urban services through the outsourcing of certain utility services to the private sector and \nfurther promotes private sector development through provision of improved urban infrastructure \nand environment for businesses. \n \n19.  Drainage-related activities will include rehabilitation of floodways and drains upstream of \nthe Asaga and Gasegase confluence in the lower catchment area, and installation of water \ngauges for flood monitoring in the upper and lower catchment areas. The sanitation component \nprovides a range of solutions to meet varying sanitation needs and concerns in the CBA, \nadjoining low-lying areas, and urban Apia. The Project also includes capacity building of the \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2003. IN64-03.

Components and Outputs \n20.  The  Project\u2019s  three  components  are  (i)  drainage,  (ii)  wastewater  management  and \nsanitation,  and  (iii)  capacity  building.  Project  outputs  include  (i)  improved  floodways;  (ii) \nrehabilitated existing drains; (iii) installation of water gauges for flood monitoring; (iv) design, \nconstruction, and operation of a wastewater collection and treatment system; (v) utility-managed \nindividual sanitation systems; and (vi) strengthened institutions and legislative frameworks for \nwastewater management, drainage, urban management, and environmental monitoring. \n \n1.  Component A: Drainage for the Gasegase and Asaga Catchments \n21.  Component A mitigates the effects of flooding in the Gasegase River, Asaga Stream \nBypass, and Fugalei Stream area to the southwest of the CBA, and will provide data to develop \na broader drainage management plan to guide future improvements. The component focuses \non rehabilitating the floodway (440 meters [m]) in the Fugalei River downstream of the Fugalei \nStreet Bridge to the confluence with the Gasegase Stream (860 m) in Asaga Stream Bypass \nand  (1,550  m)  in  the  Gasegase  River.  Accumulated  waste  in  the  mangroves  lining  the \nGasegase River to its mouth in Vaiusu Bay will be removed. Upstream of Fugalei Street Bridge \nin the Fugalei Stream (1,350 m) and north of Vaitele Road of Asaga Stream Bypass (1,075 m), \nstorm drains will be cleaned, rubbish and silt removed, and survey levels established. Water \ngauging stations will be installed in the project area and other catchments to monitor flood flows \nand  provide  data  for  hydraulic  modeling  and  further  drainage  design.  Topographical  and \ncadastral surveys will establish levels in the floodplain and low-lying area, support hydraulic \nmodeling of flood flows, guide design and implementation of civil works. Pumps that can be \nmounted on trucks will be provided to release floodwaters from constrained drainage ways and  \nprovide emergency pumping for areas where foul water may accumulate, to minimize health \nhazards. \n \n2.  Component B: Wastewater Management and Sanitation Infrastructure for \nApia \n22.  Component B, which addresses urgent wastewater and sanitation needs in urban Apia \nand, has three subcomponents:  \n \n(i)  Individual  system  rehabilitation  and  septage  collection  and  treatment \nprogram. SWA will implement an operation and maintenance (O&M) program for \nindividual systems, which will include rehabilitation of systems in low-lying areas \nand regular pump-out of all individual systems in greater Apia. A detailed sanitary \nsurvey at the start of the Project will determine specific rehabilitation needs, \ndefine  rehabilitation  standards,  prioritize  rehabilitation  activities,  and  identify \nappropriate pump-out intervals. SWA will manage private sector O&M contracts \nfor delivery of individual sanitation system services. The program will be funded \nby a sanitation surcharge on all greater Apia water bills. Up to 500 households \nwill be included in the rehabilitation program, and all of greater Apia\u2019s 8,000 \nhouseholds will be provided septage collection services. The Project will provide \ntwo 10 cubic meter (m3) vacuum trucks for this service. Septage will be disposed \nof  in  lined  lagoons  at  the  Tafai\u2019gata  landfill  and  in  a  pilot  waste-to-energy ", "7 \nanaerobic digester that is being developed through a government-private sector \npartnership.18, 19 \n \n(ii)  CBA wastewater collection  and treatment system. The wastewater system \nincludes 2.0 km of sewers, 1.3 km of rising mains, and a wastewater treatment \nplant (WWTP) with an average capacity of 950 m3/day. The WWTP will meet \nsecondary treatment standards and include disinfection. WWTP effluent will be \ndischarged to adjoining subsurface infiltration galleries. The WWTP also serves \nseveral  priority  special  needs  areas,  including  the  National  Hospital,  Malifa \nSchool,  and  Fugalei  Market,  which  make  up  approximately  450  m3/day of \nindicated capacity. WWTP will treat its biosolids (sludge) and dispose of it in the \nTafa\u2019igata  landfill.  This  system  will  serve  approximately  110  business  and \ngovernment customers. \n \n(iii)  Special needs area wastewater treatment. A number of areas with particularly \nsignificant pollutant sources or other factors requiring special consideration and \nprioritization for improved wastewater management were prioritized for inclusion \nunder the Project. These areas include the National Hospital, Malifa Education \nCompound,  Fugalei  Market  area,  and  the  commercial  area  from  Mulivai  to \nVaisigano streams along the Main Beach Road. The total wastewater flow for \nthese  facilities  is  approximately  450  m3/day.  These  areas  will  be  directly \nconnected to the CBA scheme, with sewers connecting these facilities to the \nCBA collection system, sized to allow future connections.20 Approximately 3.0 km \nof sewers and 0.4 km of rising mains will be constructed to connect these \nsystems to the WWTP. The Project includes an allocation for additional special \nneeds areas based on criteria to be developed during the detailed design phase, \nwhich may be addressed through a range of technical options, including reuse of \nexisting systems.  \n \n3.  Component C: Capacity Building \n \n23.  Component C will provide capacity building in technical and management areas as well \nas community awareness programs. Capacity building will focus on SWA, with targeted capacity \nbuilding for MWTI, PUMA, Fisheries Department, MOA, and MOH. Capacity building will be \nprovided in the following technical and utility management areas: (i) project management; (ii) \ncontract  management;  (iii)  utility  management;  (iv)  financial  management,  including  billing \nsystems;  (v)  customer  management;  (v)  community  awareness  and  public  relations;  (vi) \nplanning  for  wastewater  management  and  drainage;  (vii)  technical  aspects  of  wastewater \nmanagement and sanitation systems; (viii) asset management; (ix) development of project and \ninstitutional monitoring systems; (x) development of ambient water quality standards and an \nambient water quality monitoring system; (xi) health benefits monitoring for the MOH; and (xii) \nmonitoring of marine resources for environmental pollutants for the Fisheries Department. \n \n24.  Key to capacity building will be completion of training-needs analysis prior to developing \ntraining programs and monitoring to ensure effective capacity building. Training programs are \nbeing provided to target groups in SWA, MWTI, PUMA, MOA, and MOH. Sustainability of SWA \ncapacity building will be enhanced by funding a twinning arrangement with a well-functioning \n                                                 \n18 This project is facilitated by Sustainable Project Management, a nongovernment organization that promotes public-\nprivate partnerships. \n19 The digester is not yet operational and energy use not yet determined. \n20 The Government has no immediate plans for such connections. However, additional capacity is warranted as a \ncentralized system is likely to expand as management capacity increases and such expansion becomes affordable.

Project implementation assistance will also \nbe  included  with  the  consulting  services  package  for  this  component.21  Outline  terms  of \nreference (TOR) for these consulting services are in Appendix 14. \n \n25.  Community education and awareness programs are needed throughout the Project in \nthe  following  key  areas:  (i)  need  for  new  infrastructure  and  new  practices,  including \nenvironmental implications of unsafe sanitation and drainage practices; (ii) the application of \ngood on-site planning principles and practices for sanitation and drainage; (iii) on-site sanitation \ndesign and O&M, including information on where to seek technical assistance and advice; (iv) \nresponsibilities of the Government, households, and individuals for sanitation and drainage; and \n(v) safe wastewater practices. The focus will be on development of SWA and government \ncapabilities to develop community and public relations programs, and will emphasize proactive \nrather than reactive programs. The main activities will focus on the use of radio, TV Samoa, and \ntarget programs for groups and individuals most affected, including residents in the low-lying \nareas, youth, school children, and the Apia Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Assistance in \ndeveloping these programs is included in the capacity-building consulting services. \n \nC.  Special Features \n26.  The Government has begun a pilot project with a nongovernment organization to use an \nanaerobic digester to convert organic solid waste to energy at the Tafai\u2019gata landfill site. \nIntegration with that project may be possible by disposing of WWTP sludge to the digester. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n27.  The total project cost is estimated at $10  million equivalent. This includes a foreign \nexchange cost of $3.8 million equivalent (about 38% of the total) and a local cost of $6.2 million \nequivalent  (about  62%).  Cost  estimates  include  (i)  land;  (ii)  physical  works,  including  an \nadditional allocation  for special needs areas to be determined; (iii) consulting services; (iv) \nincremental administration; (v) contingencies; and (vi) financial charges.

", "9 \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n28.  The Government has requested a loan of $8.0 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Asian \nDevelopment Fund. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years. The \ninterest rate will be 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The Government will on-\nlend a portion of the loan proceeds ($3.5 million equivalent) denominated in tala, with foreign \nexchange risk borne by the Government for the wastewater and sanitation component to SWA \nat a 32-year term, a 5-year grace period, and interest at 5% per annum. If SWA\u2019s financial \nsituation improves, these terms may be adjusted, subject to prior agreement with ADB. \n \n29.  Samoa is a category-A country and eligible for 80% financing of the estimated project \ncost. Government counterpart funding will provide $2.0 million equivalent. ADB funding includes \n$3.8 million equivalent for foreign exchange cost and $4.2 million equivalent for local currency \ncosts.  The  Government  will  fund  any  tax  liability  over  and  above  its  20%  counterpart \ncontribution.  The  Government  is  committed  to  providing  timely  counterpart  funds  and  will \nincorporate required amounts into the budget for financial years 2004/05 onward. Counterpart \nfunding requirements and debt service on the loan are reasonable compared to Treasury \nresources and ongoing commitments to other externally funded projects.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n30.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency (EA). A project steering \ncommittee has been constituted, chaired by the chief executive officer (CEO) MOF and co-\nchaired by the managing director of SWA and CEOs of MWTI and Ministry of Natural Resources \nand Environment. Other steering committee members include the CEOs of MOA, MOH, Ministry \nof Women, Community and Social Development; and the general manager of the Electric Power \nCorporation. \n \n31.  The  Project  will  have  two  Implementing  Agencies  (IA):  (i)  MWTI  for  the  drainage \ncomponent, and (ii) SWA for the wastewater management and sanitation component. A project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be established. The EA will appoint a local, full-time, dedicated \nproject manager acceptable to ADB, who will be financed under the loan, to coordinate project \nactivities; monitor overall project progress; and manage project accounts, procurement, and \nreporting; and report to the project steering committee. The PMU will  be assisted by designated \ncoordinators from each of the IAs and PUMA, and implementation assistance consultants, ", "10 \nthrough the implementing agencies.  Coordinators will report to the steering committee.22  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n32.  The loan is expected to be effective by the end of the first quarter of 2004. Preparatory \nactivities,  including  detailed  design,  tender  documentation,  and  procurement  of  consulting \nservices will be completed by the end of 2004, with construction and commissioning to be \ncompleted by the end of 2006. This timeframe takes account of the wet season and appropriate \nconstruction  periods.  Capacity  building  and  the  community  awareness  program  will  be \nundertaken over the entire project period (2004-2005). \n \n3.  Procurement \n33.  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. Major contracts for civil works valued at greater than $1 million and supply \ncontracts  valued  at  $500,000  or  more  will  be  undertaken  through  ADB\u2019s  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures (ICB). Equipment packages valued at less than $500,000 will be \nprocured following ADB\u2019s procedures for international shopping (IS). Civil works estimated to \ncost $1 million or less per package will be carried out under local competitive bidding (LCB) \nprocedures acceptable to ADB, and in accordance with government procurement laws and \nregulations. For LCB packages, local contractors have the expertise and capacity to undertake \nsuch works. Since such civil works will involve mainly labor costs, international contractors are \nunlikely  to  be  interested  in  the  works,  and  the  use  of  LCB  is  considered acceptable. In \naccordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in the bidding for LCB \ncontracts. Prequalification, selection, and engagement of contractors will be subject to ADB \napproval.23 As soon as the bids received have been evaluated, the proposal for award of \ncontracts will be submitted to ADB for approval. It will be furnished with three copies of (i) an \naccount of the public opening of bids, (ii) summary evaluation of bids, (iii) the proposal for \naward, and (iv) a draft contract or letter of acceptance. Promptly after such award, ADB will be \nfurnished with three copies of the contract as executed. The internationally tendered equipment \npackages will include technical support to ensure proper installation, testing, commissioning, \nand training of operational staff as part of the related contracts. This approach assures quality \ncontrol  in  equipment  installation  and  operator  training  by  utilizing  the  manufacturers\u2019  and \nsuppliers\u2019 technical experts who are most knowledgeable about the equipment. \n \n34.  The EA has requested ADB to approve advance action to initiate the early start of   \nconsultant recruitment so that project implementation proceeds in a timely manner and project \ngoals can be achieved as soon as possible.24 Recruitment of international consultants is for \nproject implementation and capacity building. Advance recruitment of consultants will be carried \nout in conformity with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government was \nadvised that approval of advance  action does not commit ADB to finance procurement and \nrecruitment costs or to finance the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n35.  The staff of SWA, PUMA, and MWTI need strengthened expertise in management and \ntechnical areas described for component C and project implementation assistance. Capacity \nbuilding will be achieved through consultant inputs that will include formal training based on a \n                                                 \n22 Supplementary Appendix F includes an implementation arrangement organization chart. \n23 ADB will encourage the EA to use ADB-approved standard bidding documents (to be developed as necessary) to \nensure high quality and consistency of the documents, which will hasten ADB\u2019s review. \n24 Approval of advance action was published in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 September 2003. ", "11 \ncomprehensive training needs analysis and hands-on training on project facilities. A twinning \nrelationship  with  an  experienced  wastewater  utility  will  be  established  for  SWA.  Capacity \nbuilding will be financed from the loan. \n \n36.  Provision has been made for 48 person-months of international and 65 person-months \nof domestic consulting services to support SWA in Project implementation and provide the \nnecessary  capacity  building  to  be  funded  under  the  loan.  These  consultants  will  provide \nassistance to SWA in the areas of ADB procedures and reporting, recruitment of detailed design \nconstruction  and  operations  contractors,  design  review,  procurement,  quality  control, \nconstruction supervision, start-up testing, commissioning, O&M training, and implementation of \nthe  project  performance management system  (PPMS).  Detailed  design  of  the  wastewater \nsystem  will  be  undertaken  through  a  design-build-operate  contract.  Outline  TOR  for  the \nconsulting services are in Appendix 14. In addition to training provided directly by the consulting \nfirm, SWA will use loan funds to finance a twinning arrangement, with an allocation of 10 \nperson-months  with  a  regional  wastewater  utility  to  foster  sustainable  long-term  capacity \nbuilding  and  cooperation.  This  twinning  arrangement  will  be  retained  separately,  with  the \ncapacity-building  consultancy  assisting  in  developing  appropriate  TOR,  implementation \nmechanisms, and contracting arrangements. The project manager for the PMU will be recruited \nwith loan consultant funds under a separate package that will include provisions for accounting \nand administrative services. \n \n37.  Recruitment of consultant services as a firm will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod, and other arrangements satisfactory to the ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The firms will be required to submit a full technical proposal. The PMU project \nmanager will be recruited as an individual in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n38.  An imprest account will be established by the EA immediately after loan effectiveness. \nReplenishment to the imprest account will be supported by appropriate withdrawal application \nand related documentation. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not \nexceed $300,000 equivalent. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure may be used for \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures and liquidation of  imprest account expenses. The SOE \nprocedure  is  applicable  to  individual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $50,000. \nDetailed arrangements for the establishment and operation of  the Imprest Account and SOE \nprocedure will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook 2001. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n39.  The EA and SWA will maintain separate accounts for the Project. The EA, through the \nPMU, and SWA will maintain records of all project expenditures. The EA, through the PMU, will \nprepare consolidated project accounts, which will be audited annually by independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB. Loan consulting services include funding of accounting and administrative \nservices for the PMU, including funds to cover quarterly accounts and independent audits. \nCertified copies of such audited accounts will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after \nthe end of the financial year to which they relate. An externally audited financial statement of \ngovernment and SWA project accounts will also be submitted to ADB annually, no later than \nnine months after the end of the relevant financial year, for the entire implementation period.25 \n                                                 \n25 SWA has three tiers of audit: internal, government, and external. ", "12 \nThe EA and SWA were informed of ADB's policy on submission of audited financial statements \nand possible penalties for delays in submission. The submitted audited project accounts and \nfinancial statements must be of acceptable quality; financial statements with adverse opinions or \ndisclaimers of opinion from auditors are not acceptable and cannot be submitted for this \npurpose. Independent review and scrutiny of project implementation will be undertaken for (i) \nenvironmental monitoring and adherence to Summary Initial Environment Examination (SIEE) \nand the Government\u2019s Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) provisions, and (ii) audit of \nproject accounts and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n40.  The Government will submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use of the \nloan proceeds, project implementation, and SWA performance. The reports will include (i) \nquarterly progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports; and (iii) a project \ncompletion report, no later than three months after completion of the project facilities. Progress \nreports will emphasize progress made in the areas of policy dialogue, including (i) wastewater \ntariff charges and financial management, (ii) environmental and water quality monitoring, and \n(iii) capacity building and financial management of SWA. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n41.  The PPMS indicators agreed on during project preparation include service levels, treated \nwastewater quality and other measures of operational performance, percentages of wastewater \ncollected  and  treated,  user  satisfaction  with  the  urban  environment,  and  relevant  health, \nenvironmental and economic data to monitor project impacts. The relevance and practicability of \ndata collection for the proposed measures have been confirmed with the Government. At the \nbeginning  of  the  Project,  the  Government  and  SWA  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS \nprocedures  to  systematically  generate  data  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  three  project \ncomponents and the agreed-on socioeconomic and environmental indicators to be used to \nmeasure  project  impacts.  The  PMU  and  SWA  will  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  confirm \nachievable goals, refine monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and \nprocedures no later than six months after loan effectiveness. \n \n42.  Under the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime intervals by the EA, which will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the data \nthrough its management information system. The PPMS will permit adequate flexibility to adopt \nremedial action for project design, schedules, activities, and development impacts. The PMU, \nwith assistance from consultants, will monitor and assess activities, and report to ADB quarterly \non the physical implementation and financial aspects of the Project as well as environmental \naspects to ensure that progress and impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB \nrequirements. \n \n8.  Project Review \n43.  Regular ADB review missions are envisaged, and a midterm review will be undertaken \nby ADB and the Government, approximately 1.5 years after project implementation begins. This \nreview  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements, \nachievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for policy reform and capacity \nbuilding measures. A detailed review of the wastewater tariffs will also be undertaken. Feedback \nfrom the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n ", "13 \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n44.  The  Government  has  confirmed  its  request  for  a  concurrent  TA  for  institutional \nstrengthening of infrastructure planning as it relates to the Project and long-term planning for \ndrainage and wastewater management.26 Project investments need to be supported by further \nplanning, including (i) development of drainage and wastewater management plans for Apia, (ii) \nrevision of building standards for on-site sanitation systems, and (iii) development of enabling \nlegislation and implementing regulations for improved wastewater management and sanitation. \nThe  sustainability  of  the  outputs  delivered  under  the  Project  will  depend  on  (i)  improved \nplanning  and  management  for  PUMA,  SWA  and  MWTI;  (ii)  systems  to  strengthen \nimplementation of regulations for the Government\u2019s new Planning and Urban Management Bill27 \nand (iii) improved community awareness and understanding of new planning and development \nprocesses. The TA is expected to start soon after loan effectiveness, or April 2004, and be \ncompleted by March 2005. \n \n45.  The TA has two components: (i) drainage and wastewater management planning and (ii) \nurban planning and regulation. Long-term drainage and wastewater management plans for \ngreater Apia, and enabling legislation will be developed. These plans will detail preferred \ntechnical,  institutional,  policy,  and  legislative  measures  to  address  current  to  long-term \nrequirements, and emphasize integration and phasing so that improvements are affordable and \nsustainable. The enabling legislation for wastewater management, including sanitation, will \ndescribe institutional arrangements for wastewater management. The planning and regulation \ncomponent focuses on institutionalizing the new PUMA Bill with key stakeholders, including \nPUMA, MWTI, and SWA. It will facilitate new planning assessment processes and procedures \nand implementation of a land planning and geographic information system (GIS) for PUMA. The \nTA will also help PUMA develop a strategy for community awareness. \n \n46.  The TA involves 11 person-months  of international and 13 person-months of domestic \nconsultants,  who  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  simplified  technical \nproposal, and other arrangements satisfactory to  the ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $475,000 equivalent, with $400,000 \nequivalent  financed  by  ADB.28  Expertise  areas  to  be  recruited  under  the  TA  include \ncivil/environmental  engineering,  urban  planning,  environmental  law,  GIS,  and  community \ndevelopment awareness. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n47.  The Project will improve environmental conditions, reduce health risks, and provide \ngreater amenities to Apia\u2019s 60,000 residents, approximately 2,000 working population, and \n50,000 visitors. The Project directly benefits residents of Apia through provision of sanitation \nservices. A proportion of the 1,750 residents (minimum 500) of the low-lying areas will benefit \nfrom  rehabilitation  of  household  sanitation  facilities  to  a  minimum  standard.  Businesses, \ngovernment departments, and other organizations in the CBA will benefit from connection to the \ncentral reticulated sewerage system. The upgraded sanitation services for the National Hospital \nwill benefit the 10,000 in-patients and 50,000 outpatients annually, hospital and MOH staff \n                                                 \n26 This TA is included in the current Country Strategy and Program Update for Samoa (footnote 17) as Capacity \nBuilding for Drainage and Sanitation. The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 \nFebruary 2003. \n27 The Government anticipates that the planning and urban management bill will be enacted by the end of 2003. \n28 Cofinancing from the Japan Special Fund has been applied for.  If the application is not approved, the TA will be \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ", "14 \n(approximately  130),  and  the  adjacent  village.  The  Malifa  compound  population  of \napproximately  2,200  students,  staff,  and  Department  of  Education  staff  will  benefit  from \nimproved  sanitation.  Residents  and  businesses,  particularly  vendors  based  in  the  Fugalei \nmarket and their customers, will benefit from improved drainage. These benefits include less \ndisruption to roadways and footpaths during and after rainfall, less water damage to roadways \nand footpaths, reduction of surface litter entering Apia harbor and neighboring mangrove areas. \n \n48.  Indirect beneficiaries of the Project include the fisheries industry through improved \nmarine  resources  from  reduction  in  seawater  pollution,  and  the  tourism  industry  through \nimproved urban and marine environments. \n \n49.  Staff of PUMA, MWTI, MOA, and MOH will upgrade skills and capabilities through \ntraining, and a twinning arrangement with an experienced wastewater utility will benefit SWA. \nThe Government will benefit from improved environmental and health outcomes, and from \nreductions in health expenditures in relation to water-related disease. \n \nA.  Policy Reform \n50.  The Project supports key government policy reforms and  several ADB  Water Policy \ninitiatives, including (i) improved urban management and planning, (ii) improved provision of \nurban  services,  (iii) cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform  (discussed  in  Financial  Aspects);  and \n(iv) private  sector  participation  in  provision  of  urban  water  services,  (v)  mainstreaming \nenvironmental management, (vi) poverty alleviation and access to basic services (vii) regulation \nof public services, and (ix) stimulating private sector development. \n \nB.  Institutional Strengthening \n51.  Consultant advisory services will be provided under the loan to assist in the institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building of the key stakeholders, namely, SWA, MWTI, MOA, MOH \nand PUMA. Capacity building will occur via a program of formal, informal, and on-the-job \ntraining.  \n \nC.  Social Dimensions \n1.  Land and Resettlement \n52.  The overall government strategy for drainage and wastewater management is to avoid \nland  acquisition,  and  the  Project  follows  this  approach.  Nevertheless,  preliminary  design \nindicates that some limited land acquisition involving up to three landowners (1.6 hectares) may \nbe necessary for drainage. This level of land acquisition is considered insignificant by ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  only  a  short  resettlement  plan  (SRP)  is  required \n(Appendix 13). If any significant land acquisition or resettlement becomes necessary during the \ncourse of the Project, it will notify ADB. In all cases, the Government will ensure that land \nacquisition is carried out in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations of the Borrower, \nand ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  No  land  acquisition  is  expected  for  other \ncomponents as government land will be used for the WWTP, sewers, pump stations, and \nseptage treatment lagoons.  \n \n2.  Poverty \n53.  The Project provides direct benefits to the poor through improved living conditions, \nhealth, and limited job creation; and indirect benefits by reducing income poverty that accrue ", "15 \nfrom reduced health care costs, increased productivity, and economic development. The Project \nwill make a limited direct and greater indirect contribution to poverty alleviation.  \n \n54.  The proportion of the poor in the service area population cannot be quantified as no \nofficial poverty line has been determined for Samoa.29, 30 There is evidence that some of the \npoorest households in Apia are in the low-lying area identified in the project design for sanitation \nfacility rehabilitation. Many Apia residents are urban migrants who live outside the traditional \nvillage structure and are exposed to greater social and economic risks because they have no or \nlimited access to traditional social protection mechanisms. These poor households will benefit \nfrom improved living conditions and reduction in health risks. Greater Apia is likely to include \nsome poor households who will share the same benefits but with greater marginal utility. The \nimproved marine environment will benefit the urban poor relying on fishing for consumption and \nincome, as well as recreational users. As an environmental project, the Project will improve \nliving conditions for all in the service area, including the poor. Improved environmental quality \nwill promote sustainable urban development, for example, through tourism. Improvement in \nwater quality will contribute to the steady development of the water tourism industry. \n \n55.  The Project will directly reduce poverty by providing limited jobs for unskilled laborers \nduring construction and for ongoing drainage maintenance. Poverty reduction impacts can be \nexpected from economic growth as a result of improvements to CBA infrastructure, private \nsector participation in provision of utility facilities, and improved marine environment for the \nfisheries industry. An inventory to assess the quality of sanitation facilities throughout the project \narea will also assess the capacity and willingness of the poor to pay for improved services. The \ndesign of the cost-recovery framework will take into account the impact on the poor and \nvulnerable.  \n \nD.  Financial Aspects \n56.  Cost recovery from user charges is proposed only for the wastewater components; \ndrainage and capacity building will be funded by the Government. Full cost recovery is the \ntarget recovery rate from users. However, government policy also considers the social and \neconomic aspects of utility provision as well as affordability of customer charges such that the \nGovernment may substitute part of user charges with a CSO. Government will ensure that user \ncharges are set at minimum to recover operations, maintenance, and management (OMM) of \nSWA\u2019s wastewater services. The Government will also ensure that the cost of any on-lending to \nSWA is either charged to customers, through user charges, or provided by MOF through a \nCSO.31  SWA  is  also  seeking  an  appropriate  return  for  providing  the  service  in  line  with \ncommercial principles and the Public Bodies Act. Further public relations and consultation work, \nparticularly government commitment to improving and tightening environmental standards, will \nbe undertaken, before the Government decides on the allocation between recovery from user \ncharges and government funds. Since for the CBA scheme about half the revenue is from public \nbodies, specific consideration of the impact on MOF and budgetary allocation will also be \nconsidered. \n \n                                                 \n29 The Government is developing a poverty line with assistance from of ADB. 2001. Consultative Workshops on \nPoverty Reduction Strategies in Selected PDMCs. Manila. The 1997 household income and expenditure survey \nattempted to identify a basic-needs poverty line and a food poverty line, but these have not been accepted and lack \ncredibility.  \n30 ADB. 2002. Priorities of the People, Hardship in Samoa. Manila includes living in areas as subject to flooding as \nhardship. This is further supported by general agreement that those who can afford to avoid living in such areas do \nso. \n31 CSO will not cover up or make up for any inefficiency in tariff collection.  ", "16 \n57.  The proposed charging mechanism is to introduce (i) a water volume based sewerage \nsurcharge for all customers of the CBA and Special Needs Areas, and (ii) a water volume-based \nenvironmental charge for all other customers in urban Apia.32 Customers will be issued a single, \nitemized bill, and will be disconnected if the charge is not paid in full. The tariff structure for the \nenvironmental charge will likely include a provision to support those in hardship, similar to the \nexisting lifeline tariff for water. \n \n58.  ADB funds will be re-lent to SWA at the same terms as the ADB loan but at 5% interest. \nFor the CBA scheme, although the calculated tariffs appear high compared to the water charge, \nthey are not out of line given that currently water tariffs do not even cover O&M. Estimated \ntariffs at break even (ST4/m3) and at full cost recovery (ST5/m3) are lower than the unit \noperational cost of treatment for the few businesses in Apia that treat their own wastewater to a \nsimilar standard (ST7/m3 and ST9/m3). For the individual systems the estimated environmental \ncharge for a household with average water consumption is ST11 per month at break even, and \nST14 at full cost recovery. This represents 2.3% of a low-income household\u2019s income of \nST600/month.  A  low-income  household  with  very  low  water  use  would  pay  nothing.  The \nfinancial internal rate of return was 9.7% for the CBA and special needs and 6.8% for the \nindividual systems. Both exceeded the calculated weighted average cost of capital of 4.9%.33 \n \n59.  SWA does not have a history of financial viability and makes a considerable loss each \nyear in providing water services. This is largely a result of provision of water to rural areas \nundertaken  as  a  social  obligation  although  not  financially  viable.  The  position  has  been \nexacerbated by (i) recent grant funded investments in rural operations, lack of counterpart funds \nfrom Government, and delays in customer connections to provide the required cost recovery for \noperations; and (ii) CSO payments for water for 2003/04 have provided only 30% of the amount \nclaimed.34 Net trade debts as of 30 June 2003 were reported at ST2 million. The current cash \nposition of SWA is poor. SWA has prepared a 5-year financial plan that aims to improve \nfinancial performance to at least cover O&M. The plan shows that wastewater operations will \nhave a positive impact on performance. The metering program has improved collection rates \nand reduced unaccounted-for-water. This is expected to improve further over the next few \nyears.35 \n \n60.  Financial planning for the wastewater component is designed to ensure that its financial \nimpact on the SWA is positive. Two aspects of the Project will also help improve SWA\u2019s \nfinancial performance: (i) assistance in financial planning and management and an assurance \nthat  CSOs  for  water  as  well  as  wastewater  are  tightly  defined  and  transparent,  and  (ii) \nimprovements to the billing and database system. The extent to which SWA becomes financially \nviable depends on CSO payment for water more than any other factor. \n \nE.  Economic Aspects \n61.  The  Project  will  be  the  first  major  physical  infrastructure  project  following  PUMA\u2019s \nestablishment and is an important step in the process to establish a fully functioning urban \nmanagement system. Direct and indirect benefits will accrue to the economy of Apia and, \ntherefore, as the capital of Samoa, to Samoa as a whole. Direct economic impacts include \nsavings from the cleanup of unsanitary floodwater; and from reduced traffic disruptions, damage \n                                                 \n32 Special arrangements will be made for residents with private water supply. \n33 Government equity was calculated at 7.9% based on the current 12-month bond. \n34 About 30% of the claim was for lost revenue from the planned tariff restructuring for commercial customers. This \nwas not introduced. \n35 Unaccounted-for water was reduced from 72% in 2001 to 44% in 2002. Billing collection rates have improved from \n52% in 2001 to 80% in 2002. ", "17 \nto property and resources, expenditure on environment-related diseases and epidemics, and \nloss  of  economic  activity.  Indirect  benefits  include  improved  investment  and  business \nopportunities, including general commerce, tourism, and aquaculture resulting from a cleaner, \nmore  attractive  urban  environment,  and  improvements  to  productivity  from  a  healthier \nworkforce. The planning, legislative, and institutional strengthening components will improve \ncoordination, prioritization, and chances of success of future projects, thus promoting long-term \nsustainable economic growth. \n \n62.  The Project has been selected based on identified needs and priorities: government and \nbeneficiary  affordability,  least-cost  solutions,  appropriate  technology,  and  ease  of \nimplementation. Alternative solutions were considered to determine geographical coverage of \nthe reticulated system and each special needs areas. For urban areas outside the CBA, \ndevelopment of a reticulated system remains the long-term goal but is not affordable now. \nUpgrading the systems of the most vulnerable households and proper O&M of existing systems \nwas considered affordable while recognizing the benefits of improved environmental standards. \n \n63.  An economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the Project as a whole, \ngiven the integrated nature of drainage and wastewater. Economic costs included physical and \nnonphysical project components. Valued benefits included (i) estimated repair cost savings from \nflood damage, (ii) estimated labor cleanup cost of flood damage, (iii) resource cost savings on \nminimal individual sanitation systems as in current practice, and (iv) willingness to pay for \nwastewater management. The base case EIRR of 12.4% exceeded the economic opportunity \ncost of capital, which is assumed to be 10% Under sensitivity tests, even under the most \nadverse scenarios, the Project was found to be economically viable or so close to be marginal. \nThe EIRR is likely to underestimate the true value of the Project, largely because many of the \nidentified benefits are excluded from the EIRR calculation.  \n \nF.  Environmental Aspects \n64.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Project was completed under TA36 and \nhas confirmed its classification as category B. The Project\u2019s overall environmental effects are \npositive. The Project will (i) improve surface and groundwater quality, including marine waters, \nby reducing untreated and partially treated sewage discharges to the environment; (ii) improve \npublic health by reducing sewage and decreasing flooding; and (iii) reduce solid waste to the \nurban streams and marine waters by improving drainage system management. \n \n65.  Several  alternatives  for  wastewater  management,  including  treatment  and  disposal \noptions and alternative sites for the facilities, were reviewed. The combination of individual \nsystem improvement, and the selected option for the limited reticulated system with secondary \nbiological treatment, disinfection, and land disposal of effluent at an environmentally appropriate \nsite represents the most cost-effective and environmentally appropriate solution. It will protect \nthe surface and groundwater of urban Apia. \n \n66.  Potential impacts during construction are those typically expected for any construction \nactivity,  including  erosion  and  sedimentation,  traffic  disruption,  and  noise.  These  will  be \nmitigated by standard engineering practices and proper construction methods. Typical mitigation \nmeasures include dry-season construction, placement of erosion control material, use of silt \nfences, and limitation of construction work hours. Operational concerns such as odor control are \nmitigated by appropriate siting, selection of minimal-odor technologies, odor-control measures, \nand capacity-building programs to support proper operations and maintenance.

A preliminary environmental management plan (EMP), which is attached to the SIEE, \nspells out environmental measures that will be required of the final design, construction, and \noperations. The EMP will be refined during the detailed design phase. The SIEE is included as a \nsupplementary appendix. Appendix 11 includes a project environmental analysis.  \n \nG.  Project Risks \n \n68.  Project risks center on (i) continued commitment to improved urban management, (ii) \nbusiness  community  participation  in  the  sewerage  connection  program,  and  (ii)  the \neffectiveness and sustainability of capacity-building measures. The Government\u2019s commitment \nto  the  Project  and  overall  urban  management  has  been  demonstrated  through  the \nestablishment of PUMA, promulgation of Planning and Urban Management Bill, and efforts to \ndevelop this Project. Business community support and participation have been fostered through \ndialogue with the business community during project development, continuing pre-loan dialogue \non tariff needs and private sector participation in the provision of wastewater services.37 To \nenhance  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  the  capacity-building  measures,  the  capacity \nbuilding consultancies emphasize a high level of interaction with Government and SWA staff \nduring the entire Project. The establishment and funding of a twinning arrangement for SWA \nwith a well-established utility promotes long-term capacity building. Financial risks include (i) \ninadequate  cost  recovery  resulting  in  greater-than-anticipated  government  subsidy  of \nwastewater  management  operations,  and  (ii)  inadequate  financing  of  SWA  water  supply \noperations.  However,  the  Government  and  SWA  have  demonstrated  their  commitment  to \nimprove cost recovery through recent water tariff increases, enactment of the public bodies bill \nto promote sustainable commercial operations for public enterprises, and review of the Project\u2019s \ncost recovery issues. The Project emphasizes the importance of building community and other \nstakeholder  awareness  and  commitment  to  the  Project,  as  well  as  building  SWA  and \ngovernment responsiveness to the community\u2019s needs and views. Land acquisition risks, which \nonly affect portions of the drainage component, are minimal due to limited land acquisition \nrequirements. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n69.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n(i)  By 30 August 2004 the Government will establish a SWA division dedicated to \nwastewater management and sanitation services with adequate staffing. SWA\u2019s \ncorporate plan will be updated to reflect the role of the wastewater division. The \nGovernment will further ensure the appointment of a qualified full-time Project \nManager satisfactory to ADB for the PMU by 30 July 2004, and such position will \nbe retained at least until the completion of project construction activities. \n \n \n                                                 \n37 This pre-loan assistance has been supported through the Water Cooperation Fund, pilot demonstration activity \nprogram, and TA (footnote 3). ", "19 \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that throughout project implementation, no material \norganizational changes (either financial, operational or structural) to, or material \nasset transfers to or from SWA, will be made without the prior approval of ADB, if \nsuch changes would affect the ability of the Government or SWA to perform their \nvarious obligations under the Project Agreement and re-lending agreement.  \n \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the counterpart financing necessary for the \nProject is provided and disbursed in a timely manner to enable completion of \nproject activities, and that additional counterpart funding will be provided for any \nshortfall in funds or cost overruns. \n \n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  an  appropriate  wastewater  tariff  and \nenvironmental fee will be endorsed by the Cabinet by 30 December 2005, and \nimplemented on commissioning of the project facilities such that (a) wastewater \ntariff revenues and environmental fees cover at minimum the cost of OMM; (b) no \nentity, whether any government agency, institution, or enterprise, regardless of \nownership,  will  be  granted  an  exemption  from  the  wastewater  tariff  and \nenvironmental fees established pursuant to the above, or granted a preferential \nrate, or excused for delays in payments without penalties; and (c) the impact of \nany user charges on the poor is reviewed and appropriate measures introduced \nto protect the basic living standards of the poor. \n \n(v)  The Government will ensure that (a) provision of CSOs by SWA for water and \nwastewater  services  is  annually  approved  in  accordance  with  procedures \nestablished under the Public Bodies Act; and (b) sufficient budget funds are \nallocated and disbursed in a timely manner to finance the difference between the \nestablished tariffs and full cost recovery tariff that includes an agreed rate of \nreturn in accordance with agreements between MOF and SWA that will set forth \nthe (a) form and detail of the CSO application, and (b) financial and SWA \noperational and management performance requirements. \n \n(vi)  The  Government  will  develop  an  appropriate  act(s)  concerning  wastewater \nmanagement by 31 December 2005, that (a) clearly defines institutional roles for \nwastewater  management  and  sanitation;  (b)  establishes  requirement  and \nprocedures  for  development  of  regulations,  guidelines,  and  standards  for \nwastewater management, including industrial and trade waste discharges to the \nwastewater system (including pretreatment standards), and the environment, \nWWTP effluent standards, and ambient water quality standards; (c) requires \nconnection  to  a  centralized  system  where  one  exists;  and  (d)  provides  for \nindependent monitoring of utility service providers. These regulations, guidelines, \nand standards shall be issued by 31 December 2006 and implemented by 30 \nSeptember 2007. The Government will revise existing Building and Planning \nStandards, with consideration of the TA recommendations, to ensure compliance \nwith the Planning and Urban Management Bill by 30 June 2005. \n \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that the MWTI will implement a comprehensive \ndrainage O&M program through contracting of the private sector, community \ngroups, and involvement of appropriate stakeholders by 31 July 2005. \n \n(viii)  The  Government  and  SWA  will  ensure  that  all  applicable  government \nenvironmental  laws,  regulations,  and  standards,  and  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and \nprocedures, in particular ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines 2003, are ", "20 \nadhered  to  throughout  project  implementation  and  that  all  environmental \nmonitoring and mitigation measures identified in the SIEE, the EMP, and the \ngovernment\u2019s  environment  assessment  process  are  fully  implemented.  The \nGovernment and SWA will further ensure that environmental mitigation measures \nare  incorporated  into  design  and  bidding  documents.  The  Government  will \nmonitor and record EMP implementation under the guidance and supervision of \nPUMA  and  will  include  monitoring  information  in  project  progress  reports \nsubmitted to ADB. \n \n(ix)  The Government will develop a land access and land acquisition plan for future \ndrainage, wastewater, and sanitation works. The plan will identify priority areas \nand processes for access and acquisition and provide for reservation of sufficient \nland at the WWTP site for future expansion and a reasonable buffer zone in \naccordance with other relevant government laws by 30 June 2006. \n \n(x)  The Government will ensure that all land and rights of way required by the \nProject will be made available in a timely manner, i.e., before civil works on the \naffected property, and that the provisions of the SRP, including compensation \nand entitlements for APs, will be implemented in accordance with all applicable \nlaws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement, Guide to Good \nPractice. The Government will ensure timely provision of sufficient counterpart \nfunds for land acquisition and resettlement activities and meet any obligations in \nexcess of the SRP budget estimate and ensure that the APs will be at least as \nwell-off as they would have been in the absence of the Project. Adequate staff \nand resources will be committed to supervision and internal monitoring of the \nimplementation of the SRP. The SRP will be updated as necessary to reflect any \nsignificant material changes of the Project scope, and such changes will be \nsubject to ADB approval. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n70.  As a condition for loan effectiveness, the Government agrees that the Government and \nSWA shall have  entered into an re-lending agreement in a form satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n71.

Introduction and Scope \n \n1.  The relevant subsectors analyzed here are urban wastewater management, sanitation, \ndrainage, and overall urban planning and management. This analysis summarizes the current \nstatus of the subsectors, including  (i) relevance to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Water \nPolicy and country strategy, (ii) indicators such as environmental quality and access to sanitation, \nand (iii) institutional framework. Lessons learned and the need for the Project are also presented. \n \nB.  Sector Context \n \n2.  Samoa is a small archipelago consisting of two main islands\u2014Upolu and Savai\u2019i\u2014and five \nsmaller islands, with a total area of 2,820 square kilometers. In 2001 the population1 was \n176,848, with natural increase of about 1% per annum. However, with significant emigration, net \npopulation growth is estimated at 0.5% as it has been for the last 30 years. Some 98% of the \npopulation lives on the coastal plains in small villages, including in and around urban Apia, the \ncapital, on Upolu. Approximately 60,872 people or 34.4% of the population lived in Apia while \n52% lived in northwest Upolu, including Apia and the undulating foothills stretching 30 kilometers \n(km) to the northwest. Much of development is between these foothills and the coastline. \n \nC.  ADB Sector Focus and Country Strategy and Program \n \n3.  ADB's Water Policy calls for support of integrated water resource management (IWRM), \nimproved and expanded delivery of water services, foster cooperation and awareness, promote \nregional cooperation, facilitate the exchange information, and improve governance. It further \nemphasizes the need for autonomous management of water utilities, cost recovery, and private \nsector participation while ensuring access and equitable service to the poor and vulnerable. \n \n4.  The Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU) for 2004-2006 for Samoa aims to \nimprove  the  enabling  environment  for  accelerated  private  sector  growth  and  employment \ngeneration  through  enhancing  the  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  private  sector \ndevelopment, supporting sound macroeconomic and financial policies and management, and \nfacilitating public-private partnerships and privatization of state-owned enterprises. Second, the \nstrategy aims to improve access to basic public services. Third, ADB will continue to help the \nGovernment improve living standards and reduce income disparity. The strategy reflects the \ncommon aspirations of vulnerable and disadvantaged communities, as expressed in ADB\u2019s \nparticipatory poverty surveys: 2 employment, access to basic services, and education. \n \n5.  The Project supports ADB\u2019s strategy for Samoa and ADB\u2019s Water Policy by (i) fostering \ngood water and environment governance, (ii) improving living conditions, and (iii) promoting \nprivate  sector  growth  and  generating  employment  opportunities  through  private  sector \nparticipation in wastewater service provision  and improving environmental infrastructure. The \nwater policy is supported through (i) emphasis on IWRM, that is promoted through the capacity-\nbuilding efforts for PUMA; and (ii) regional cooperation and exchange of information through a \ntwinning arrangement with an established wastewater utility. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Extracted from the 2001 National Population and Household Census for Samoa. \n2  ADB. 2001.

Samoa has made strong progress over the past two decades in economic and social \ndevelopment. The Strategy for the Economic Development of Samoa 2002-20043  continues \ngovernment emphasis on macroeconomic stability; public sector efficiency and reform; improved \neducation and health standards; and better urban planning and management, including provision \nof infrastructure, and a strong private sector.  \n \n7.  Samoa\u2019s  stable  political  environment,  combined  with  vigorous  economic  growth  and \ninclusive  social  development  strategies,  has  contributed  towards  Samoa  achieving  its \ndevelopment goals. With a Human Development Index of 0.590. Samoa rates  well on the \nachievement of social development goals. Adult literacy rates for both genders (96%) and gross \nenrolment rates in primary (94%) and secondary (70%) levels are high by Pacific developing \nmember country standards. Infant mortality (22 per 1,000 births), under-5 mortality (35 per 1,000 \nbirths), and maternal mortality (4 per 100,000 births) rate amongst the three lowest in the Pacific \nregion. Some 90% of the population has access to potable water. Concern for the environment is \nstrong.  New  legislation,  Planning  and  Urban  Management  BiIl  (PUMA  Bill)  deals  with  the \nbiophysical, social, and economic environments. Drafted in 2002, it is expected to be enacted in \nDecember 2003.4 Real gross domestic product (GDP) was 6.5% in 2001 and 6.9% in 2000. \nStrong economic growth has been attributed to development of commerce, public administration, \nhotels, and restaurants, transportation, communications, construction, and fisheries. Economic \nactivities and government offices are concentrated in Apia, particularly the central business area \n(CBA).  \n \n8.  The 2001 census data indicate that 88% of the population has access to safe sanitation, \nand World Bank data for 2002 indicate that 95% of the urban population has improved facilities.5 \nThis access to sanitation data misrepresents the public health implications of the sanitation status \nof many living in the urban areas. In urban Apia, for example, about 75% of households have \nseptic systems, but many are too small, rarely cleaned, and sometimes directly linked to the \nnearest drainage channel, polluting groundwater, surface streams, and the harbor. In the CBA \nand special needs areas (those with special wastewater concerns) such as hospitals and major \nschool compounds, less than 10% of wastewater is adequately treated. The hospital has a poorly \noperating treatment plant, as do most commercial centers and government complexes. Others \nhave inadequate septic systems. The situation is exacerbated by the historical lack of urban \nmanagement, including  the absence of drainage or wastewater management plans and the \nabsence of effective town planning. Individuals have elevated their plots heights, reclaimed land \nin the mangrove area, and blocked drainage channels. The effect is a haphazard and cumulative \nnonfunctioning drainage system. Flooding after heavy rain is intensified, and foul water flooding \nposes a health risk due to septage and latrine wastes being released to the surface environment. \nThe Health Sector Strategic Plan specifically identifies environmental health issues, including the \nlack of a public sewerage system and drainage problems, as affecting public health. The plan \nlinks recent outbreaks of dengue, incidence of diarrhea, respiratory and skin diseases with the \nneed for more intensive environmental health control.6  \n \n                                                 \n3  Government of Samoa. 2002.

Capacity-building components described elsewhere in the Report and Recommendation of the President \naddress this issue. ", "  Appendix 4  29 \n9.  Nearshore marine water and urban stream-water quality in Apia has been significantly \ndegraded due to inadequate sanitation and wastewater management systems. Water quality-\nmonitoring  data,  which  have  been  only  intermittently  collected,  show  definitive  evidence  of \nsewage  contamination  as  evidenced  by  low  dissolved  oxygen  saturation,  high  biochemical \noxygen  demand  (BOD),  high  total  nitrogen  concentration,  and  high  indicator  bacteria \nconcentration.7 Urban drains are often choked with litter and vegetation, foul smelling (indicating \nanaerobic conditions), and contain floating oil and sewage. Drains and natural watercourses are \ncontaminated with sewage and, occasionally, industrial waste. Monitoring is done infrequently \nand usually result from donor-funded activities, including previous Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)-supported TA.8 Samoa has no legislative framework for environmental standards. \n \n10.  The Apia Drainage Scheme, completed in 1993, was based on fieldwork carried out \nduring 1979. Substantial growth and changes to land use and urban growth, which greatly affect \nrunoff and drainage characteristics, occurred after the fieldwork. Much of Apia is built on low-lying \nflood prone land, parts of which were mangroves prior to land reclamation and development. \nFilling is most prominent in the natural floodplain area of Vaiusu Bay adjoining the CBA, with such \nactivities continuing to change storm water runoff patterns, groundwater and flood flow patterns. \nThe continuing lack of urban planning including lack of land use controls and guidelines, land \nfilling, encroachment into waterways and lack of drainage maintenance, continue to contribute to \nthe incidence of flooding and impact on property and health.  \n \n11.  Detailed historical data on the frequency and extent of flooding are not available. A recent \nSouth Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) study9 records a long history of flooding \nin Apia. Severe floods were reported in 1939, 1975, 2001, and May 2003. Less severe floods \noccur more frequently; moderately severe flooding was reported in 1982, 1991, and 2000. Minor \nlocalized flooding is more frequent. The 2001 flood was particularly severe, estimated to have \ndamaged some 1,300 buildings. Residential and commercial properties were flooded, some \nthigh-deep, leaving a layer of mud when the water abated. In the low-lying areas, residents were \nforced to evacuate to higher ground. Stock and equipment were damaged and many businesses \nand schools were forced to close to clear up damage for up to several days. Traffic congestion \nand road damage from the mud and debris were severe, particularly near Fugalei Market. More \nthan  28,000  people  were  affected  by  water  cuts  resulting  from  damage  to  water  supply \ninfrastructure. Some businesses not directly affected by the flood were forced to close because of \nthe water supply cut. The estimated repair bill exceeded ST11 million (2001 prices).10 \n \n12.  Previous proposals for sanitation in Apia in the mid-1980s to late 1990\u2019s all advocated \nlarge-scale  sanitation  systems  based  on  a  reticulated  system  serving  a  minimum  10,000 \npopulation.11 These schemes were physically extensive, covering the CBA area, low-lying areas \nand floodplains, and industrial estates some 6 kilometers to the northwest. By the end of the \n1990s, the promotion of such blanket schemes for sanitation failed to win government and other \nstakeholder support. Large scale schemes were not considered appropriate to the Samoan \nsituation  because:  (ii)  the  high  cost  of  such  schemes,  (iii)  little  institutional  capacity  and \n                                                 \n7  For example, fecal coliform levels in Vaiusu Bay have been measured at over 5,700 organisms per 100 milliliter (ml), \nwhile the United States standard for shellfish gathering is 14 organisms per 100 ml.

", "30  Appendix 4 \ncommitment to implement, operate and maintain a large scale sewerage scheme (iv) priority of \nimproving the Apia water scheme and implementing water tariffs (v) disposal to sea by ocean \noutfall was seen by many as resulting in adverse impacts on the marine ecology and image of \nSamoa,  and  (vi)  the  proposed  sewage  treatments  plant  sites  in  northwest  Apia  were  not \nconsidered appropriate. Given this background, the emphasis of Government since 2000 has \nbeen to review options that address these stakeholder issues and concerns.12 This has included \na focus on incremental sewerage system development and integrated solutions that meet the \ntechnical and affordability needs of the varying user groups while concurrently developing the \nplanning and urban management framework.  \n \nE.  Institutional Framework: Laws, Policies, and Government Agencies \n \n13.  The Government throughout the last decade has been increasingly concerned with the \nimpact that rapid population and development pressures are having on: (i) inadequate urban \ninfrastructure provision to cope with the rising expanding urban population, (ii) the absence of an \nagreed framework and coordinated approach for urban management and planning, including \nunclear institutional arrangements, and (iii) the need for resolution of land issues in the urban \narea (land supply, land tenure and land availability) to meet the timely demand for housing, \ninfrastructure development and urban expansion. Its reform agenda includes institutional reform, \nto reduce the scope of government activity through rationalization, corporatization and contracting \nout  of  some  services.  The  dramatic  downsizing  of  the  Ministry  of  Works  Transport  and \nInfrastructure (MWTI) and outsourcing of many of their traditional functions is an example of \nthis.13 The Strategy for the Economic Development of Samoa 2002-04 continues the emphasis on \nmacro-economic stability and sustainable growth, supported by further efficiency improvements \nand also a focus on social and environmental aspects to support the policy program. Public \nhealth, environmental quality, and better urban planning are all incorporated  into the Strategy. \nSimilarly, the focus on sustainability, (of planning, development, natural resources, waste and \npollution  control)  and  their  appropriateness  for  Samoa  are  emphasized  in  the  Tourism \nDevelopment Plan 2002-2006. \n \n14.  Government  efforts  toward  more  efficient  provision  of  water  supply  services  on  a \ncommercial basis were initiated through the creation of the Samoa Water Authority through the \nWater Authority Act in 1993. Presently, the government is committed to the principle of full cost \nrecovery and autonomy of SWA and other Government utility corporations as expressed in the \nrecent Public Bodies Act; however it recognizes that full cost recovery from user charges is not \nfeasible now due to broader environmental,  economic, and social objectives. It thus supports \npublic utilities through Community Service Obligations (CSO) for services that contribute to these \nbroader objectives. SWA currently provides no wastewater or sanitation services and thus has no \nspecific capacity in this area, though it does have reasonable water supply services capacity. \nConsequently,  the  Project  includes  a  substantial  capacity  building  component.14  Urban \ninfrastructure and services have traditionally been provided by national government agencies \nsuch as the Department of Lands, Survey and Environment (DLSE), MWTI and the Ministry of \nInternal Affairs (MIA). The social, cultural and administrative aspects of traditional village life in \nApia come under the legally established village councils of which the MIA has administrative \nresponsibility.15  These  agencies  planned  and  provided  for  infrastructure  requirements  and \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2000.

Evaluation of Current Framework, Needed Reforms, and Capacity Building \n \n15.  The  current  framework  provides  a  strong  foundation  for  continuing  improvements  in  \nurban management and the provision of wastewater and sanitation services. Nevertheless, there \nIs continued capacity building of SWA, PUMA, and MWTI and reforms to further foster the \nGovernment\u2019s reform of state-owned enterprises (SOE), particularly the SWA in the areas of \nfinancial management and autonomy. Specifically, there is a need to foster the Government\u2019s \nexpressed goal of improving transparency of the CSO, overall financial autonomy, and general \ngovernance of public utilities by addressing these issues for SWA under the capacity-building \ncomponent of the loan. Project management capacity building will foster the MWTI strategy to \noutsource works to the private sector. PUMA is a young agency with substantial responsibilities. \nAssistance in developing subsector management plans, regulations, and guidance documents \nare key capacity building needs. Targeted assistance to Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of \nAgriculture (MOA) will help provide needed monitoring data. \n \nG.  Lessons Learned \n \n16.  ADB and other donors have studied the urban infrastructure situation in Samoa over the \nlast  20  years.  Wastewater  management,  drainage,  and  sanitation  infrastructure  and  urban \nmanagement recommendations have received no or lukewarm support for the reasons described \nabove.  Lessons  learned  are:  (i)  process  involving  consultation  and  dialogue  amongst \nstakeholders is important achieving project support; (ii) large scale reticulated solutions are not \nappropriate now for a number of reasons, including affordability (Government and consumers), \ninstitutional capacity, and technical capacity; (iii) land tenure matters are an integral part of project \ndesign and implementation; (iv) ocean discharge of effluent requires a high level of treatment and \nlong outfall pipes to meet marine environmental concerns; and, (v) sanitation and wastewater \nmanagement infrastructure improvements need to be undertaken in the context of broader urban \nmanagement  planning.  Solutions  need  to  be  locally  driven  and  respect  the  local  situation, \nincluding understanding of why previous schemes have not won broad stakeholder support. The \nProject  addresses  these  lessons  learned  by  including  multi-faceted  solutions.  It  is  an \nappropriately scaled incremental approach with capacity building components that acknowledge \naffordability levels and institutional and technical capacity while incorporating expandability and \nflexibility for future improvements.  \n \nH.  Need for the Project \n \n17.  Rehabilitation  and  improvement  to  drainage  and  floodways  to  mitigate  flooding  that \nregularly occurs in the CBA  and low-lying areas is urgently needed. Wastewater and sanitation \nimprovements are needed to meet basic human requirements for domestic households and \nmitigate the impacts of inadequate wastewater facilities in the CBA and other identified priority \nneeds areas. These are important steps to establish a fully functioning urban management \nsystem. Besides the benefits of physical development, the Project also includes appropriate \nplanning, legislative, and institutional strengthening to support both the successful implementation \nof this Project and increase the likelihood of future projects.  \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2000. Capacity Building for Urban Planning and Management. Manila. ", "32  Appendix 5 \nINSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.  Introduction and Scope \n \n1.  The institutional analysis covers the three agencies significantly affected by the Project: \nMinistry of Works Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI), Samoa Water Authority (SWA), and \nPlanning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA). The Ministy of Health (MOH) and Ministry of \nAgriculture  (MOA)  have  new  monitoring  responsibilities,  and  the  Project  addresses  their \ncapacity requirements. The analysis includes input from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  projects,1  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development \n(AusAID) Institutional Strengthening Project, various missions leading to the loan, and source \ndocuments  and  reports  from  agencies  concerned;  and  describes  the  agencies\u2019  present \ncapabilities and assesses them against their current mission and the proposed project impacts. \nThe  analytical  framework  covered  the  institutional  dimensions  relevant  to  the  successful \nimplementation of the Project, including corporate management and governance, financial and \nhuman resource capabilities, performance and results management, customer and community \nrelations management, and capacity to change. This appendix summarizes the full analysis. \n \nB.  Samoa Water Authority \n \n2.  Government  efforts  toward  more  efficient  provision  of  water  supply  services  on  a \ncommercial basis were initiated through the creation of the SWA in 1994. Although it does have \nreasonable water supply services capacity, SWA provides no wastewater or sanitation services \nand thus has no specific capacity in this area. \n \n3.  The Government is committed to the principle of full cost recovery and autonomy of \nSWA and other government corporations,2 while recognizing that full cost recovery from user \ncharges is not feasible now due to environmental, economic, and social objectives. It supports \npublic utilities through Community Service Obligations (CSO), for services contributing to these \nobjectives. Although SWA has not been financially independent, upcoming tariff increases aim \nto improve financial performance to at least cover operation and maintenance. The Government \nis committed to making CSOs more transparent, conditional, and allocated to specific activities, \nrather than simple budget funding, and this should improve SWA\u2019s finances. The Project will not \nenable SWA to become financially independent, but the Government\u2019s clear intention is to \nensure  that  for  wastewater,  CSOs  and  user  charges  at  minimum  cover  operations, \nmaintenance, and management (OMM), and debt service and to this extent, the wastewater \noperations of SWA will be financially sustainable. Better billing and collection will improve the \nfinancial situation of SWA\u2019s water operations. Loan assurances require appropriate CSOs for \nwater and wastewater services. \n \n4.  Current performance challenges include reducing the high levels of unaccounted-for \nwater, billing and collection, and metering. SWA has improved the level of unaccounted-for \nwater from 72% in 2001, and aims to further reduce it from 44% in 2002 to 30% within 5 years. \nBilling and collection rates are improving, with a revenue recovery rate of approximately 80% in \n2002 from 52% in 2001. The gap is due to nonpayment and non-billing. Metered customers now \nnumber over 6,000 or 33% of total customers. Water quality varies according to water source \nbut meets locally set standards, and 70% of World Health Organization (WHO) standards. \nCustomers and community perception is mixed with some reluctance to acknowledge the cost \nof water and the \u201duser pays\u201d principle. Lessons from the European Union Rural Water Supply \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000. Capacity Building for Urban Planning and Management. Manila; and ADB. 2002. Implementation of the \nUrban Planning and Management Strategy. Manila. \n2  As expressed in the Public Bodies Act. ", "  Appendix  5  33 \nProject warn against extensive capital investment without corresponding expansion of service \ndelivery and associated revenue collection. SWA lacks contract management capabilities due to \nminimal experience with outsourcing. \n \n5.  SWA has a corporate management framework in place, with corporate and business \nplans focused on results. Its customer management focus and community education could be \nimproved.  The  SWA  Board  is  required  to  have  50%  of  its  directors  from  outside  the \nGovernment. \n \n6.  To address the capacity shortfalls, the Project includes a substantial capacity-building \ncomponent focusing on technical and management areas, in particular in asset and financial \nmanagement,  contract  management,  customer  management,  billing  and  collection,  and \nwastewater  management  and  sanitation  operations  and  monitoring.  Capacity  will  be  built \nthrough structured training, development of systems and procedures, and establishment of a \ntwinning arrangement with an established water authority. \n \nC.  Ministry of Works Transport and Infrastructure \n \n7.  MWTI has been dramatically downsized through the Government\u2019s institutional reform \nprogram and now acts as a coordinating and project management agency for a range of \ninfrastructure projects. Its key need is stronger project management, contracting and contract \nsupervision, and performance monitoring. In the technical area MWTI requires strengthening in \nhydraulic model use and drainage maintenance. The capacity-building program will address \nthese needs by establishing programs for drainage maintenance and performance monitoring, \ndeveloping  procurement  and  tendering  procedures,  and  using  hydraulic  modeling  and \nstructured training. \n \nD.  Planning and Urban Management Agency \n \n8.  PUMA was established in 2002 after an ADB-assisted government study to develop a \nmore  effective  planning  and  urban  management  strategy.3  This  effort  involved  extensive \nstakeholder consultations, which revealed an urgent need for an integrated approach to urban \nplanning and development. Further assistance4 is being provided to help PUMA achieve its \nambitious urban planning and management mission. \n \n9.  As a new and inexperienced agency, PUMA requires support in project management \nand procurement. Other shortfalls in capacity relate to its new responsibilities in drainage and \nwastewater  management.  The  Project  will  support  PUMA  by  developing  water  and \nenvironmental  quality  monitoring  programs  and  revising  environmental  impact  assessment \nguidelines and regulations. The associated TA will help PUMA by strengthening the policy, \nprocedural, and legislative bases for water and sanitation. The TA will develop drainage and \nwastewater plans; prepare draft legislation including for environmental monitoring; develop \nbuilding codes and regulatory procedures; implement a geographic information system; and \nprovide training. \n \nE.  Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture \n \n10.  MOH and MOA will receive support from monitoring programs, laboratory upgrades, and \ntraining to enable them to undertake their new responsibilities. \n \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2000.

Financing Plan \n \n1.  The Project with an estimated cost of $10 million, is proposed to be funded by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Asian Development Fund (80%) and through government counterpart \ncontribution (20%). The Executing Agency (EA), Ministry of Finance (Treasury Department or \nTreasury) will fund the Government\u2019s 20%, including $500,000 in land contribution and $1.5 \nmillion in cash or in kind covering the cost of private land, staff, office space, and other costs. \nThis amount can be reduced if land swaps or other alternative payments can be made to \nlandowners. Committed counterpart funding contributions over fiscal years (FY) 2005 to 2009 \ntotal  $2.0  million  (ST6.1  million)  and  are  mainly  incurred  in  the  first  3  years.  Although \ngovernment funds are severely restricted, the proposed counterpart funding does not appear \nout of line. Government will incorporate counterpart contributions into the budget for FY2004  \nonward  to  cover  counterpart  funding  and  timely  disbursements  are  included  as  a  loan \nassurance. \n \n2.  The Treasury Department will be ultimately responsible for all loan repayments to ADB. \nThe ADB loan of $8.0 million will have loan repayments of $400,000 per annum (ST1.2 million) \nfrom 2012 to 2036. Total government debt in 2001 was $159 million (ST503 million). Estimates \nof loan repayments for 2002-2003 were ST18.0 million, including ST13.4 million in principal \nrepayments and ST4.6 million in interest. The additional burden of the proposed loan is in the \norder of 2%, which is considered to be affordable.  \n \n3.  The Treasury Department will enter into an on-lending agreement with SWA for the \nproposed physical aspects of the sanitation components (design, civil works, and materials and \nequipment) of about $3.5 million. SWA will be responsible for repayments to the Treasury \ndepartment as set out in the agreement. Treasury will finance the repayments for drainage, \ncapacity building, and project implementation support. \n \nB.  Government Institutional Reform and Implementing Agency Performance \n \n1.  Ministry of Works, Transport, and Infrastructure  \n \n4.  Under the ongoing public service reform program, the Ministry of Works, Transport and \nInfrastructure  (MWTI)  took  on  new  responsibilities  in  January  2003  and  is  undergoing \nconsiderable reorganization and rationalization. The intention is that the original Public Works \nDepartment will become the Land Transport Ministry by 2004. From staff of around 500, there \nare now less than 100. Responsibilities now focus on policy setting; asset management; and \nregulation of ports, roads, bridges, seawalls, and drainage. All construction and maintenance is \ncontracted out to the private sector, in many cases to new businesses set up by employees of \nthe former Public Works Department. This change process has been supported by the World \nBank under phase 1 of the Infrastructure Asset Management Program.  \n \n5.  The  annual  MWTI  budget  for  FY2003  was  ST27  million,  excluding  foreign  capital \nassistance grants and soft loans. The operation and maintenance for the proposed drainage \nproject will be procured through a private sector contract, managed by MWTI. The estimated \ncost of the contract is about ST75,000 and is considered affordable. Private sector contracting is \nexpected to reduce costs improve efficiency and outputs, but will require MWTI to successfully \nmanage the contract, monitor, and regulate the outputs. \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  39 \n \n2.  Samoa Water Authority   \n \n6.  The  Samoa  Water  Authority  (SWA)  is  an  independent  government  corporation, \nestablished in 1994. SWA is responsible for the water supply of about 80% of the population. It \nemploys 138  staff (2003) and has 17,734 customers (as of December 2002). Annual water \nproduction is about 16 million (m3) (46,000 m3 a day). Coverage in the urban area is more than \n90%. \n \n7.  SWA is listed as a potential public trading body under the 2001 Public Bodies Act, which \ndescribes the principal objectives of public trading bodies as (i) to be as profitable and efficient \nas comparable businesses that are not owned by the state, and (ii) to meet community service \nobligations (CSOs) as directed. A CSO is defined as provision of good or service, agreement or \naction \u201con any other terms other than normal commercial terms.\u201d In this way government policy \naims to encourage efficiency in utility operations and also provide services that have desirable \nsocial or economic outcomes through payment to said utilities for undertaking CSOs.  \n \n8.  SWA  has  made  some  progress  over  the  past  years  in  moving  toward  financial \nindependence and transparency of operations. However, SWA does not have a history of \nfinancial viability and makes a considerable loss each year in providing water services. This is \nlargely a result of provision of water supplies to the rural areas, which is undertaken as a social \nobligation and is not financially viable. The position has been exacerbated by recent grant \nfunded investments in rural operations, lack of counterpart funds from the Government, and \ndelays in customer connections to provide the required cost recovery for operations. Net trade \ndebtors at 30 June 2003 were reported at ST2 million. Allocated budgetary CSO payments for \nwater for 2003/04 were only 30% of the amount claimed largely because they are neither tightly \ndefined nor transparent. To date, none of the CSO payment for 2003/04 has been made and the \ncurrent cash position of SWA is extremely difficult. The situation demonstrates that the process \nof establishing the level and effective CSO payments is not well developed and requires \nattention particularly for the CSO for rural water provision and capital works. \n \nTable A9.1: Samoa Water Authority, Summary Financial Indicators  \n(ST million) \nItem  1998\u20131999  1999\u20132000  2000\u20132001  2001\u20132002 \nIncome  4.7  4.5  3.7  4.9 \nExpenses  (11.2)  (11.0)  (12.1)  (11.9) \nNet Loss from Operating Activities  (6.5)  (6.6)  (8.4)  (7.0) \nAccumulated Losses  (10.2)  (16.8)  (24.2)  (31.2) \n         \nTotal Assets  70.2  68.4  66.2  68.5 \nLoans Outstanding  8.5  8.5  0.0  0.0 \nGovernment Equity Injection (including  5.5  4.6  6.1  4.9 \nCSO) \n         \nReturn on Capital Employed  (1.3)  (1.4)  (1.9)  (1.6) \nCurrent Assets Ratio  3.3  3.4  6.3  4.8 \n  CSO=community service obligation. \n \n9.  SWA  implemented  tariff  increases  in  July  2003.  The  changes  were  largely  an \nappropriate  restructuring  of  water  charges  to  encourage  water  conservation  and  further \nreductions in unaccounted-for water. Simplification of the tariff to commercial customers was not \nimplemented since it would have had a negative impact on SWA finances. A summary of key \nindicators is shown in Table A9.1 based on SWA annual reports and audited accounts. \n ", "40  Appendix 9 \nD.  Tariffs, Cost Recovery, and Project Financial Appraisal \n \n1.  Cost Recovery and Tariffs \n \n10.  Cost recovery from user charges is proposed only for the wastewater components; \ndrainage and capacity building will be funded by the Government. In line with government policy \nfor user pays systems and financial independence of public corporations, full cost recovery is \nthe target recovery rate. However, government policy also considers the social and economic \naspects  of  utility  provision  as  well  as  affordability  of  customer  charges  such  that  the \nGovernment may substitute part of user charges with a CSO. The Government will ensure that \nuser charges are set at minimum to recover operation, maintenance, and management (OMM) \nof the wastewater services provided by SWA. Government will also ensure that the cost of any \non-lending  to  SWA  is  either  charged  to  customers  through  user  charges  or  provided  by \nTreasury through a legally binding and transparent CSO.1 SWA is also seeking an appropriate \nreturn for providing the service in line with commercial principles. Further public relations work \nabout the Project, particularly government commitment to improve and tighten environmental \nstandards will be undertaken, in conjunction with continuing public consultation before the \nGovernment decides on the allocation between recovery from user charges and government \nfunds. As about half of the customers for the central business area (CBA) scheme (in terms of \nwater volume) are public bodies, then specific consideration of the impact on Treasury and \nbudgetary allocation will also be considered. \n \n11.  The proposed charging mechanism is to (i) introduce a water volume-based sewerage \nsurcharge on the water bill for all customers of the CBA and Special Needs Areas (about 110 \nmainly commercial customers); and (ii) a water volume based environmental charge on the \nwater bill for all customers in urban Apia.2 Customers will be issued a single, itemized bill and \nwould be subject to disconnection if the charge is not paid in full. Payments made will reduce \nthe wastewater charge first. Under the Project, an analysis of combining electricity water and \nwastewater charges will be undertaken. The eventual tariff structure for the environmental \ncharge will likely include a provision to support those in hardship, similar to the existing lifeline \ntariff for water. However, unlike water the \u2018free allocation\u201d will likely be cross-subsidized by \nhigher water users through the tariff rather than paid for as a CSO.3  \n \n12.  ADB funds will be on-lent to SWA in the local currency tala (ST), at the same terms as \nthe ADB loan (32 years and an 8-year grace period) but at 5% interest to cover the foreign \nexchange risk. Tables A9.2 and A9.3 show the tariff, average user charges, and CSO payment \nimplications of three pricing options.4 CSO payments are calculated in line with the \u201ccommercial \nprinciples\u201d objective of the Public Bodies Act such that the CSO is the amount corresponding to \nthe difference between the tariff charged and the full cost recovery rate.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The CSO will not cover or make up for any inefficiency in tariff collection. For the CBA scheme a collection rate of \n85% based on analysis of debtor list for water for said customers, and 70% for individual systems.  \n2  Water supply connections number about 7,000 domestic and 160 commercial users. Special arrangements will be \nmade for residents with private water supply. \n3  All tariff calculations for individual systems assume cross-subsidy such that no CSO is required to cover the \u201cfree \nallocation.\u201d \n4 Tariff estimates are based on the tariff applied to 100% of water supplied, and increase annually relative to inflation \nto cover the increase in OMM cost.

For the CBA scheme, although the calculated tariffs appear high compared to the water \ncharge, they are not excessive given that (i) currently water tariffs do not even cover operation \nand maintenance (O&M), and (ii) the high cost of wastewater collection and proper treatment \nand disposal. The estimated tariffs at break even (ST4/m3) and at full cost recovery (ST5/m3) \nare lower than the unit operational cost of treatment for the few businesses in Apia that treat \ntheir own wastewater to a similar standard (ST9/m3 and ST7.7/m3 [Business 2 in Table A9.2]). \nSome  businesses  with  very  large  water  use  (Business  3)  spend  minimal  amounts  on \nwastewater currently, and it is these businesses that require strict enforcement of proposed \nenvironmental  standards.  The  cost  of  meeting  these  standards  individually  exceeds  the \nestimated wastewater charges. For example, the capital cost alone of Business 3 meeting \nsecondary treatment standards would be about ST1.5 million. Significantly, public bodies tend to \nfall into this category, currently spending minimal amounts on wastewater treatment and with \nrelatively high water consumption.  \n \nTable A9.3: Individual Systems: Estimated Tariffs, User Charges, and  \nCommunity Service Obligation Payments \n  Example Monthly Charges \n(ST) \n    Tariff /  Annual  Household 1  Household  Household \nOptions  m3   CSO  (average)  2 (low)  3 (high)  \nPayment \nST \nA.

For the individual systems the estimated environmental charge for a household with \naverage water consumption is ST11 per month at break even and ST14 at full cost recovery. \nThe calculation includes an entitlement of 0.5 m3 a day \u201cfree\u201d the same as the CSO for water, \nbut in this case, rather than a CSO payment, the tariff is adjusted such that high volume users ", "42  Appendix 9 \ncross  subsidize  the  low  volume  users.  Average  tariffs  represent  2.3%  of  a  low-income \nhousehold of ST600/month. Given the \u201cfree entitlement,\u201d a low income household with very low \nwater use would pay nothing. A household using low volume of water, as in household 2, would \npay between ST4 and ST7 per month. \n \n2.  Financial Appraisal \n \n15.  For the financial appraisal, cost recovery from user charges is assumed to cover OMM, \nand a transparent CSO payment, treated as operational income, is assumed to cover the \ndifference between that tariff rate and full cost recovery. The weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC) is calculated using the loan terms to SWA.5 The financial internal rate of return was \n9.7% for the CBA and special needs areas, and 6.8% for the individual systems. Both exceed \nthe calculated WACC of 4.9%. \n \n 3. Financial Forecasts and Sustainability \n \n16.  SWA does not have a history of financial viability and makes a considerable loss each \nyear. Recent tariff increases aim to improve financial performance to cover O&M, but this \nremains a medium- to long-term goal. The new tariff structure and metering program has \nalready improved collection rates, and this is likely to improve further over the next few years, \nparticularly in the rural areas, where the current levels of cost recovery are extremely low. \nCompletion of the rural water supply project to obtain connections and the introduction of meters \nis intended to improve revenue collection. \n \n17.  Calculated tariffs and CSO payments have been designed to ensure that the financial \nimpact of the Project on SWA is positive. The Government will ensure that for wastewater, CSO \npayments combined with user charges at minimum cover OMM and debt service for SWA. To \nthis extent, the wastewater operations of SWA will be financially sustainable. In addition, two \nspecific aspects will assist the water side of the business improve financial performance. First, \nthe Government is committed to making CSO payments more transparent and allocated to \nspecific activities, rather than simple budget funding, and the Project includes as an assurance \nthat CSO payments for water as well as wastewater are made transparent. Second, the Project \nprovides improvements to the billing and database system.  \n \n18.  SWA has prepared financial forecasts to FY 2008/09. The mi pact of the sanitation \nproject is positive, although the net position in the final year remains negative, indicating that \nSWA is not, and is unlikely to become, financially viable in the medium term. However, the \nextent to which SWA becomes financially viable depends on the agreed CSO payment for water \nmore than any other factor. \n \n                                                 \n5 Government equity contribution was assumed at 7.9%, the current yield on 12-month bonds. ", "  Appendix 10  43 \nSUMMARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Economic Rationale \n \n1.  Apia, with an urban population of around 60,000 people (about 8,200 households) is the \ncapital and the main focus for economic activity in Samoa. Over the last decade, following two \ncyclones in the early 1990s, the Government has been pursuing economic reform, within a \nculturally acceptable and socially responsible framework. Average real economic growth since \n1994 has been about 4.5%, and in 2000 and 2001 was over 6%. Gross domestic product (GDP) \nper capita is about ST5,000 per annum (around $1,570). However, the economy remains \nvulnerable, largely due to weather and other exogenous shocks, because of its small size, \nlimited diversity of economic activity, and dependence on agriculture. The economy is highly \nsupported by external sources: approximately a third of government revenues are external \ngrants, and private remittances from abroad are an important part of the economy. \n \n2.  The Government\u2019s reform agenda includes institutional reform, to reduce the scope of \ngovernment  activity  through  rationalization,  corporatization,  and  contracting  out  of  some \nservices. The Strategy for the Economic Development of Samoa 2002-2004 continues the \nemphasis on macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth, supported by further efficiency \nimprovements, and also a focus on social and environmental aspects to support the policy \nprogram. Public health, environmental quality, and better urban planning are all incorporated.  \n \n3.  Publicly and politically, there is strong concern for environmental issues. The new \nPlanning and Urban Management Bill, deals with the biophysical as well as the social and \neconomic environment. Similarly, the focus on sustainability and appropriateness for Samoa are \nemphasized in the Tourism Development Plan 2002-2006. The Health Sector Strategic Plan \nspecifically identifies environmental health issues, including the lack of a public sewerage \nsystem and drainage problems as affecting public health. The plan links recent outbreaks of \ndengue, incidence of diarrheal diseases, respiratory diseases, and skin disease with the need \nfor more intensive environmental health control.  \n \n4.  Apia shows the typical signs of inadequate planning and infrastructure provision for \nenvironmental  protection  associated  with  many  urban  areas.  Here  the  traditional  village \ncommunity responsibility in many aspects has broken down. About 75% of households are \nestimated to have septic systems but these are not functioning properly. Individual systems tend \nto be undersized, and rarely cleaned, and most are linked to the nearest drainage channel, \npolluting groundwater, surface streams, and the harbor. In the central business area (CBA) and \nspecial needs areas, less than 10% of wastewater is currently treated adequately. In Apia the \nsituation is exacerbated by the historical lack of urban management, including the absence of a \ndrainage  or  wastewater  management  plan  and  the  absence  of  effective  town  planning. \nIndividuals have raised the heights of sections, reclaimed land in the mangrove area, and built \nover and blocked drainage channels. The combined effect is a haphazard and non-functioning \ndrainage system. Flooding after heavy rain is intensified, while foul water flooding poses a \npublic health risk. \n \n5.  Detailed historical data on the frequency and extent of flooding is not available, although \na recent South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) study1 records a long history \nof flooding in Apia. A severe flood occurred in 2001, and the report estimates that 5,000 \nresidents were directly affected with water entering their home or business and 28,000 indirectly \nthrough damage to the water supply infrastructure. The estimated repair bill was in excess of \nST11 million (2001 prices). \n                                                 \n1 A Review of Flooding in Apia, Samoa, April 2001, Yeo, July 2001, SOPAC Technical Report 338.  ", "44  Appendix 10 \n \n6.  The  Project  provides  the  first  major  physical  infrastructure  project  following  the \nestablishment of the Planning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA) and is an important \nstep in establishing a fully functioning urban management system. In addition to demonstrating \nthe benefits accruing from physical development, the Project also includes appropriate planning \nand legislative and institutional strengthening to support both the project implementation and \nincrease the likelihood of future projects. \n \n7.  Without the drainage component, the CBA and surrounding low-lying areas will continue \nto be subject to flooding with unsanitary water with its associated damage to property, economic \nactivity, livelihood, and public health. Without the wastewater component, the population of Apia \nis exposed to public health risks associated with poor sanitation, pollution of ground- and \nsurface water, and consequent impacts on the urban living environment. The Project provides a \ntwo-pronged urban management solution to reduce the risk and mitigate the impacts of flooding \nin the CBA and surrounding low-lying areas. \n \nB.  Project Description and Beneficiaries \n \n8.  The drainage component will improve the drainage and mitigate the risk of flooding for \nthe CBA and an estimated 225 households (1,800 people) in the immediate area. Beneficiaries \ninclude more than 150 institutional and businesses establishments, an estimated 2,000 working \npeople, and most of the estimated  50,000 annual holiday visitors. \n \n9.  The wastewater component will provide (i) improved urban environment and public \nhealth for all 60,000 urban residents of Apia (about 8,200 households) through a regular pump-\nout system for septic tanks and latrines, and septage treatment and disposal; rehabilitation of \nsystems in the low-lying area identified as a priority (about 500 households); and (ii) reticulated \nsewerage collection, treatment, and sludge disposal for the CBA and identified special needs \nareas. As with the drainage component, beneficiaries include all establishments and persons \nwho live, own property, work or visit the CBA plus the special needs areas, including: (i) in- and \nout-patients and employees of the National Hospital (estimated at 10,000, 50,000, and 130 \npeople,  respectively);  students  and  staff  at  the  Malifa  School  compound  (2,200  persons); \nstallholders and visitors to Fugalei Market.  \n \n10.  Also, all persons affected by the negative impacts of poor drainage and wastewater \nmanagement  will  benefit  from  an  overall  improvement  to  amenity  and  environment.  This \nincludes  some  specific  examples  where  existing  wastewater  facilities  are  polluting  the \nenvironment to the extent that the odor, water quality, health and living environment is severely \naffected, such as the families living immediately downstream of the hospital wastewater facility, \nwhich regularly breaks down. Improvements in water quality will likely have positive marine and \ncoastal impacts. \n \n11.  There will also be direct and indirect impacts to the economy of Apia and, as the capital \nof Samoa, to Samoa as a whole. Apia accounts for an estimated 70% of GDP, 50% of hotel \nbeds, 80% of commerce (the largest single sector), 90% of the finance and business services, \nand 60% of public administration. Direct economic impacts include the savings from  the \ncleanup  of  unsanitary  flood  water,  traffic  disruptions,  damage  to  property  and  resources, \nexpenditure on environment-related diseases and epidemics, and loss  of economic activity. \nIndirect impacts include improved investment and business opportunities, including general \ncommerce,  tourism,  and  aquaculture,  resulting  from  a  cleaner,  more  attractive  urban \nenvironment and improvements to productivity from a healthier workforce. \n ", "  Appendix 10  45 \nC.   Project Selection and Analysis of Alternatives \n \n12.  The Project has been selected based on identified needs and priorities, government and \nbeneficiary  affordability,  comparison  of  alternatives  and  least-cost  solutions,  appropriate \ntechnology and ease of implementation. A number of previous studies from 1983 onward have \nlooked at the drainage and wastewater sector in Samoa, primarily looking at much more \nambitious schemes. For wastewater, this involved larger reticulation systems which, while \nenvironmentally preferable, are expensive. The project scale needed to be more affordable, to \nthe Government and beneficiaries. The drainage component has been scaled back to mitigate \nproblems associated with implementing projects requiring the use of customary land. At the \nsame time, the Government\u2019s priority to improve residential sanitation, particularly in the low-\nlying  areas  as  well  as  identified  special  needs  areas,  had  to  be  addressed,  balancing \nenvironmental, financial, and social considerations.  \n \n13.  Alternative solutions were considered in determining the geographical coverage of the \nreticulated system and for each of the identified special needs area. The proposed CBA scheme \nis  slightly  larger  than  was  originally  proposed  to  include  one  of  the  largest  wastewater \ngenerators.  The  net  present  values  (NPV)  of  individual  systems  were  compared  to  the \nincremental costs of expanding the CBA reticulated scheme. In both cases the incremental NPV \nof expanding the CBA scheme was lower than the NPV of an independent package treatment \nplant. Expanding the system to include these outlying buildings has the benefit of including all \nthe other customers in between and also reducing the average incremental cost of the scheme \nthrough economies of scale. For two special needs areas\u2014the Malifa School compound and \nNational Hospital\u2014a similar exercise was undertaken. The cost of an on-site package plant was \ncompared to the incremental cost of linking to the CBA scheme, including expanding the size of \nthe treatment plant. The NPV of linking to the scheme was found to be the least cost solution.  \n \n14.  A recent report reviewed and compared more than 20 options for wastewater treatment, \nincluding screening plants, aerated lagoons, biological nutrient removal, activated sludge, and \nocean outfalls. However, the options are not strictly comparable since some provide much \nhigher levels of treatment than others. The proposed solution combines a least cost approach to \nsecondary treatment through the use of a prefabricated package plant plus the use of an \ninfiltration  gallery,  maximizing  the  use  of  the  adjoining  wetlands  to  provide  additional \nenvironmental protection. Secondary treatment is necessary to avoid the need for expensive \nocean outfalls and adequately protect Vaiusu Bay, which is used for subsistence and some \ncommercial fishing. \n \n15.  For the urban areas outside the CBA, development of a reticulated system remains the \nlong-term goal, but at this stage, the opportunity cost to the Government of a larger scheme is \ntoo  high.  Rather,  upgrading  the  systems  of  the  most  vulnerable  households  and  proper \noperation and maintenance of existing systems was considered to be appropriate to affordability \nlevels, while recognizing the benefits of improved environmental standards. Currently very few \nindividual systems function properly, residents have no incentives to maintain the systems \nadequately,  and  no  regulations  compel the residents to do so. The Project will provide a \nmandatory  pump  out,  operated  through  a  private  sector  contractor,  and  residents  will  be \ncharged some or all of the cost. This system takes away the disincentive of payment at the point \nof delivery, which results in the vast majority of households doing nothing. At the same time, the \nregular charge to customers encourages people to appreciate the collective benefits of better \nenvironmental standards. \n \n \n ", "46  Appendix 10 \nD.  Economic Rate of Return Analysis \n \n16.  The analysis compares a calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the \nProject to the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC), which is assumed to be 10%.2 The \nanalysis is undertaken as a whole, rather than for specific components, since there are mutual \nbenefits from the integrated nature of drainage and wastewater. The analysis uses the domestic \nprice numeraire, and constant January 2003 prices. \n \n17.  Economic costs include physical and nonphysical project components, excluding taxes. \nThe shadow exchange rate factor was estimated to be 1.19, based on the value of imports and \nexports and related taxes and subsidies. The land to be occupied by facilities created has \nminimal chance of being used in any other productive capacity except as proposed under the \nProject, and thus a conversion factor of 0.5 was used. The incremental economic costs are \nphased over the planning period, assumed to be 20 years. Replacement costs are included for \nvacuum trucks, and a residual value is included at the end of the period. \n \n18.  Valued  benefits  include  (i)  estimated  repair  cost  savings  from  flood  damage,  (ii) \nestimated labor clean-up cost of flood damage, (iii) resource cost savings on minimal individual \nsanitation systems as in current practice, and (iv) willingness to pay for improvements to \nwastewater management. Values for flood damage were based on the Yeo report, which reports \nthe damages of the 2001 flood and assuming the risk of a severe flood of 1 in 25 years and a \nless severe flood of 1 in 5 years. These values were adjusted to (i) include only the damage to \nthe low-lying areas, primarily residents, businesses, and roads, the risk to which would be \nsignificantly reduced as a result of the Project; and (ii) to account for the underestimate of \ndamage due to non-insurance, primarily of disruption to business. Labor clean-up costs are \nminimal, assumed to be 2 days per affected building at a wage rate of ST30/day. Minimal \nsanitation systems were based on the number of commercial establishments in the CBA and an \naverage ST50,000 spent on individual systems every 20 years, plus the current pump out cost \nevery 2 years. The capital cost of the existing package plant that can be reused was included. \nFinally, coverage of operation, maintenance, and management of the wastewater components \nonly  was  taken  a  proxy  for  residents\u2019  and  businesses\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  wastewater \nmanagement. This is the Government\u2019s minimum cost recovery policy based on existing water \ncharges and a perceived minimum willingness to pay. The valuation of economic benefits is \nlikely to underestimate the true value of the Project in economic terms, largely because many of \nthe benefits are difficult to quantify, attribute, and assign a monetary value. These include \nsavings in health expenditure, and improvements in urban living and working conditions, water \nquality, and business environment. Equally important are the benefits of improving planning and \nurban management, and increasing the potential of similar projects downstream. \n \nE.  Results and Conclusion \n \n19.  The base case EIRR of 12.4% exceeded the EOCC. Standard sensitivity tests were \ntaken at 10 percent and for project delays, and project-specific sensitivity tests were undertaken \nfor (i) the conversion factor for land (from 0.5 to 1.0), (ii) willingness to pay (less 50%), and (iii) \nreduced risk of a severe flood (from 4% to 2%). Under all the sensitivity tests, the Project was \nfound to be economically viable or so close to be marginal. The calculated EIRR is expected to \nbe lower than the true EIRR since it has not been possible to value all of the economic benefits \nof the Project. Detailed economic analysis is presented in the Supplementary Appendix B. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.

Apia, particularly the central area, shows the typical signs of inadequate planning and \ninfrastructure  provision  for  environmental  protection  associated  with  many  urban  areas. \nNearshore marine water and urban stream water quality has been significantly degraded as a \nresult of inadequate sanitation and wastewater management systems. Most wastewater is now \ntreated in individual systems such as cesspools and septic systems before it is discharged to \ndrainage channels (including open channels and streams), soil, and groundwater.1 Flooding is a \nfrequent problem due to high rainfall and inadequate drainage system, that is compounded by \nland filling, blocking of drains, and lack of town planning. Flooding after heavy rain is intensified \nand foul water flooding poses a public health risk due to septage and latrine wastes being \nreleased to surface environment. The objective of the proposed project is to improve drainage, \nwastewater and sanitation management in Apia. An initial environmental examination (IEE) has \nbeen conducted in accordance with Government of Samoa guidelines2 and Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  policies.  A  summary  IEE  (SIEE)  has  also  been  prepared  and  included  in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n \n2.  The SIEE and IEE fully describe the environment. The project area\u2019s key features \nrelevant to wastewater management are as follows: (i) high island tropical climate with abundant \nrainfall (about 2,500 millimeters [mm] on average annually and about 5,500 mm at the top of the \ncatchment that drains to Apia) although there is a distinctive dry season; (ii) many rivers, lakes, \nand ponds with more than 25% of the municipality covered by water; (iii) mostly clay and sandy \nclay soil in the upland area; and (iv) in the Apia town area, including the central business area \n(CBA), the flora and fauna have been substantially modified by expansion of urban development \nand introduction of exotic plants and animals. Apia soil is characterized by coral limestone \nsands with a high water table. Soils of the Vaiusu Bay area are described as sandy clay and \npeaty sand that are difficult to drain, unsuitable for agriculture, and sustain primarily mangrove \ndevelopment. Marine waters, including Vaiusu Bay, are used for subsistence and commercial \nfishing. Tourism, which is reliant on high environmental quality, is a major economic sector. \n \n3.  Water  quality  monitoring  data,  which  has  been  only  intermittently  collected,  shows \ndefinitive evidence of sewage contamination as evidenced by low dissolved oxygen saturation, \nhigh biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) , high total nitrogen concentrations, and high indicator \nbacteria concentrations. Urban drains are often choked with litter and vegetation, emit foul \nsmells (indicating anaerobic conditions), and contain floating oils and sewage. Drains and \nnatural watercourses are contaminated with sewage and, occasionally, industrial waste. \n \nC.  Alternatives \n \n4.  Without the Project, water quality will continue to deteriorate since individual systems \ncannot effectively treat wastewater given the population density, hydrologic conditions, soil \nconditions, etc. With the Project, living conditions and aquatic environmental quality in the Apia \n                                                 \n1  There are a few, mostly poorly operating package plants at some business centers and government complexes, \nwith the facilities for the National Provident Fund Building and Lotemau business centers being the notable \nexceptions. \n2  The  Government\u2019s  1998  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Guidelines  have  not  yet  been  promulgated. \nNevertheless, the IEE was prepared to comply with Preliminary Environmental Assessment Report Guidance. ", "48  Appendix  11 \nurban area will be improved. Project preparations and numerous previous studies considered a \nnumber of alternative wastewater collection and treatment schemes. Many have involved large-\nscale schemes with varying levels of treatment, which were generally considered unaffordable \n(by the Government and consumers) and technically beyond the capacity of the country.

Environmental Monitoring and Public Participation \n \n5.  Preliminary  environmental  monitoring  programs,  which  address  monitoring  of  all \nenvironmental media, have been developed and will be finalized during detailed design. A \nbaseline water quality-monitoring program needs to be implemented to demonstrate positive \nproject effects as well as monitor sediment loadings and turbidity during construction. Key \nmonitoring points will include outlets for the Gasegase, Asaga, and Mulivai stream and the \nVaisigano River. The Mulivai Stream just downstream of the National Hospital will also be a key \nmonitoring point as will Vaiusu Bay, particularly near the WWTP.  \n \n6.  Public  participation  was  a  key  part  of  the  development  of  the  Urban  Planning  and \nManagement  Strategy  from  which  this  Project  emerged.  The  Government  is  continuing \nconsultations as part of its pre-loan preparations. The SIEE describes completed and planned \npublic participation activities, agency responsibilities, staffing needs, and monitoring programs.  \n \n7.

The Project will improve the environmental quality and public health of Apia. Adverse \nimpacts will be minimal and will be mitigated. Comprehensive monitoring and environmental \nmanagement programs will be implemented to ensure adherence to Samoan laws and ADB \npolicies.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a National Priority in    Sector identified as a National   \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   Yes  Priority in Country Poverty  Not \nPartnership Agreement?   applicable  \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Samoa:  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Nonclassified  \n1. Poverty data and information from a community consultation process contributed to the project design. \nPoverty analysis was taken into account in relation to the cost recovery and user-pay features of the wastewater \nand sanitation infrastructure components. \n \n2. The Project provides direct benefits to living conditions, health, and some limited job creation, and indirect \nbenefits to income poverty that accrue from reduced health care costs, increased productivity, and economic \ndevelopment. The Project will make a limited direct and greater indirect contribution to poverty alleviation.  \n \n3. The proportion of the poor1 in the service area population cannot be quantified meaningfully as no official \npoverty line has been determined for Samoa. There is evidence that some of the poorest households in Apia are \nin the low-lying area identified in the project design for sanitation facility rehabilitation. Many Apia residents are \nurban migrants who live outside the traditional village structure and are exposed to greater social and economic \nrisks  because  they  have  no  or  limited  access  to  traditional  social  protection  mechanisms.  These  poor \nhouseholds will benefit from improved living conditions and reduction in health risks. The greater Apia area is \nlikely to include some poor households who will share the same benefits but with greater marginal utility. Urban \npoor relying on  local fishing for consumption and income will benefit from the improved marine environment. \nCleaner marine water will benefit those using it for recreation. \n \n4. As an environmental project, the living conditions for all in the service area of the Project will improve. These \nbenefits  will  also  accrue  to  the  poor.  Improved  environmental  quality  will  promote  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment, for example, through tourism. The improvement in water quality will contribute to the steady \ndevelopment of a water-based tourism industry that depends directly on good water quality. \n \n5. The Project will directly benefit poverty reduction through the provision of some limited jobs for unskilled \nlaborers during the construction phase and for ongoing drainage maintenance. Poverty reduction impacts can be \nexpected from economic growth as a result of improvements to CBA infrastructure, private sector participation in \nthe provision of utility facilities, and improved marine environment for the fisheries industry. An inventory to \nassess the quality of sanitation facilities throughout the project area will also assess the capacity and willingness \nof the poor to pay for improved services. The design of the cost-recovery framework will take into account the \nimpact on the poor and vulnerable. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared:  Yes \nPublic consultation/participation is an element of the project design and planning and is prepared through \ncommunity-driven design mechanisms involving beneficiaries. A community participation and awareness \nprogram will be formulated and implemented to serve as ongoing consultation mechanism with the involvement \nof all stakeholders. \nParticipation Strategy  Yes \nConsultation with the community is planned as a critical component of the capacity building of involved agencies \ncomponent of the Project. The community awareness program will be developed with the direct involvement of \nthe community and will include the development of community involvement principles, a participative framework, \nand  mechanisms  for  community  awareness  and  education.  The  Project  will  assess  the  education  and \ninformation needs of the community and identify the special needs of target groups such as low-income and \n                                                 \n1 The Government has not determined a poverty line.

The information and education program will deliver targeted information about the Project and its \nimpacts, specifically the rights and obligations of the Government, households, organizations, and communities, \nand  general  information  about  related  environmental  and  health  issues.  Performance  indicators  and  a \nperformance monitoring program for community awareness will be developed and implemented. In collaboration \nwith the relevant agencies, the program will develop and implement community and customer feedback and \ncomplaint- handling procedures and will integrate this feedback into agency decision-making processes. \n \n \nD.    Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Women are fully represented to ensure that improvement of sewage \nservice and sanitary conditions reflect women\u2019s role in household activities and domestic economy, and that \nhealth and income generation benefits reflect women\u2019s needs. \n \nGender plan prepared:  No \n \nE.

The Government\u2019s strategy is to avoid land acquisition and resettlement for all drainage \nand urban services and that approach has been followed in this Project. Nevertheless, the \npreliminary design indicates that limited land acquisition may be necessary for the drainage \ncomponent. The potentially affected land involves low-lying, undeveloped land along natural \nstream floodways in the urban area. The land is unproductive and includes no structures. \nLandowners hold legal title and are not considered vulnerable by economic status, gender, or \nminority  status.  The  assessment  also  considered  the  potential  need  for  sewer  alignment \nchanges based on detailed design and determined that any reasonable shift could still only \ninvolved less than five landowners and this would only involve subsurface land use. \n \n2.  Given the few affected persons (less than 5 households) and that no structures, sources \nof livelihood, or productive lands are affected, this level of land acquisition is considered \ninsignificant by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the \nHandbook on Resettlement, A Guide to Good Practice.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n3.  The Government has well-established procedures for the taking of lands, that consider \ntraditional land tenure systems and modern systems Compensation and grievance procedures \nare well articulated in the relevant Act and these are consistent with ADB policy and guidance. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Institutional Framework \n \n4.  The Department of Lands, Survey, and Environment (DLSE) is closely involved in the \nProject through its Planning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA), which will facilitate timely \ncoordination of land acquisition. The project management unit will coordinate detailed design \nwith  PUMA  and  DLSE  to  ensure  that  land  acquisition  is  in  accordance  with  applicable \ngovernment laws and regulations, ADB policies, and this short resettlement plan. \n \n2.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n \n5.  Land  acquisition  will  be  100%  financed  by  the  national  Government.  A  budget  of \n$260,000 (ST790,000) has been allocated for this.  \n \n3.  Implementation Schedule \n \n6.  The  Government  will  undertake  preliminary  consultations  with  potentially  affected \nlandowners as part of its ongoing pre-loan preparations and no later than loan effectiveness. \nDetailed discussions will begin after detailed design has determined which, if any, landowners \nwill be affected and to what extent. Design will be completed by third quarter of 2004. \n \nD.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n7.  Monitoring and evaluation will be mainstreamed into the overall project implementation \nmonitoring program, and quarterly reports will confirm the number of affected persons and \nstatus of the land acquisition process.
