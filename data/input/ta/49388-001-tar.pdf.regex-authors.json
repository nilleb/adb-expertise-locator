INTRODUCTION \n1.  One of the core regions in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for coordinated climate, \nclean energy, and environmental policy making is the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region.1 In \n2013, the Government of the PRC promulgated its Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and \nControl, 2013\u20132017, and committed vast amounts of public funds to improve air quality in the \nregion.2 While  measures  under  the  action  plan  have  reaped  remarkable  results  to  date, \nsustainable and inclusive growth will require long-term engagement. Policies and investments \nneed  to  be  coordinated  more  effectively  to  achieve  climate  and  air  quality  goals  without \nprohibitive costs that may damage economic growth. \n \n2.  The proposed policy advisory technical assistance (TA) for Developing Cost-Effective \nPolicies and Investments to Achieve Climate and Air Quality Goals in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei \nRegion was conceptualized in October 2015 with strong support from the Ministry of Industry \nand Information Technology (MIIT). The TA concept paper was approved on 4 December 2015. \nDuring the fact-finding mission in November 2015, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) reached \nan understanding with the Government of the PRC regarding the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and outline terms of reference for \nthe TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The BTH region is home to 109.2 million people and accounted for 10% of the PRC\u2019s \ngross domestic product in 2014.4 Since the 1990s, accelerated economic growth in the region \nhas been accompanied by a disproportionately high increase in primary air pollutant emissions \nand degradation in air quality. In many respects, this region is a microcosm of the broader \nnational economy and associated challenges. Poor air quality dominates the region. The rapid \ndeterioration of air quality since 2005 has drawn global attention, prompting the government to \nadopt the action plan. \n \n4.  The action plan aims to cut the level of fine particulate matter in the BTH region by 25% \nfrom the 2012 level (with the provincial implementation plan aiming reductions of up to 33% in \nsome  Hebei  cities),  targeting  annual  concentration  of  fine  particulate  matter  in  Beijing  of \n60 micrograms per cubic meter by 2017. The action plan recognizes that to achieve sustainable, \nlong-term  air  quality  improvements  in  the  BTH  region,  industrial  transformation  of  heavy \nindustries and the power sector, as well as productivity enhancing measures, are essential.5 \n \n5.  Climate policy in the PRC is equally focused on heavy, carbon-intensive industries and \nthe power sector, which, combined, account for more than 80% of the country\u2019s total carbon \ndioxide  (CO )  emissions.  Prominent  among these  climate  policies  are  a  national  industrial \n2\n                                                \n1  The BTH region refers to Beijing and Tianjin municipalities and Hebei province. However, Shandong and Shanxi \nprovinces and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region are often associated with the BTH region because of their \nproximity to this region. \n2  State Council of the PRC. 2013. Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, 2013\u20132017. Beijing. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 November 2015. \n4  The extended BTH region covering surrounding provinces (footnote 1) is home to 267.8 million people and \naccounts for 25.7% of gross domestic product, which amounted to CNY14.63 trillion in 2014. \n5  The action plan comprises 10 measures with 30 actions, including (i) enhancing the overall treatment and reducing \nthe discharges of multiple pollutants in the power and industrial sectors; (ii) adjusting and optimizing the industrial \nstructure and promoting the upgrade of economic transition toward a clean production process; (iii) speeding up the \ntechnological reform of enterprises and improving the capability of scientific innovation; and (iv) accelerating the \nadjustment of the existing energy structure and increasing the supply by clean energy technologies. \n ", "2   \nenergy conservation program, inefficient capacity phase-out initiatives, and an emissions trading \nsystem (ETS) for CO . Energy conservation programs include the Top 1,000 (11th Five-Year \n2\nPlan) and Top 10,000 (12th Five-Year Plan) Programs, which have supported the achievement \nof national energy and CO  intensity targets. These programs have been complemented by \n2\nefforts to phase out inefficient, backward capacity, including some of the most heavily polluting \ninstallations.  Multiple  ETS  designs  have  been  pilot-tested  in  seven  cities  and  provinces, \nincluding Beijing and Tianjin, during 2013\u20132015. To support the PRC\u2019s goal to peak national \nCO  emissions by 2030 or earlier, a national ETS for CO  has been announced to begin in \n2 2\n2017, focusing on large enterprises in several of the country\u2019s most energy-intensive sectors. \n \n6.  To date, measures under the action plan and climate and clean energy policies have \nachieved notable successes, but  a lack of coordination among them has raised questions \nregarding their cost-effectiveness. These issues are even more challenging in the BTH region, \nwhere individual municipalities and provinces are at different development stages and thus have \nvarying capacities to manage policy implementation. The weakest among them in terms of \ncapacity, Hebei Province has a daunting task of managing a multitude of policy actions and \nlarge  investments.  Assessments  of  interplays  among  low-carbon  and  clean  air  policies  in \ndifferent  sectors\u2014such  as  energy,  transport,  agriculture,  urban  construction,  and  waste \nmanagement\u2014on a common analytical platform have become essential to fully capture co-\nimpacts and identify proper sequencing of interventions. Otherwise, planned interventions could \nproduce suboptimal outcomes. The absence of this critical analytical work is likely to pose \nfurther risks, especially as the ETS rollout seems imminent. \n \n7.  For cost-effective policy coordination and formulation of investment programs for the \nnext  phase  of  the  government\u2019s  action  plan,  policy  makers  need  to  assess  (i)  how  well \ncompanies in the BTH region are responding to existing directives under the action plan and \nclimate and clean energy policies, (ii) how these policies are interacting with each other in the \nregion, (iii) what constraints and barriers companies in the BTH region face in implementing \nthese policies, (iv) to what extent the policies\u2019 effectiveness may be improved in spurring low-\ncarbon innovations in technology and behavior at the company level, (v) what complementary \npolicies or measures are required to incentivize management and behavioral changes, and (vi) \nthe implications for future coordinated policy design to enable system wide low-carbon energy \ntransformation. In particular, policy makers need to understand how newly pilot-tested market-\nbased measures, in particular the ETS, will interact with existing policies and institutions, and \nhow their potential as a tool for enabling energy system transformation and related co-benefits \ncan be maximized. \n \n8.  The proposed TA will use, expand, and tailor an existing model to the BTH region to \nsupport  the  government  in  (i)  assessing  the  interaction  of  climate  and  clean  air  policies; \n(ii) capturing co-benefits and identifying synergies between policies across sectors; (iii) taking \nmeasures that are cost-effective and well-coordinated within the BTH region; (iv) identifying \npolicy and management approaches that strengthen incentives for plant-level compliance with \nenergy transformation and environmental objectives; (v) projecting the impact of incentives \ncreated  by  market-based  instruments  to  be  established,  such  as  the  national  ETS;  and \n(vi) studying the health impacts of policies. \n \n9.  The study is timely, as the action plan is well advanced and will approach completion of \nits initial phase in 2017, while the preparation of its second phase (2018\u20132022) is expected to \ncommence in 2016. The TA will help the government to formulate cost-effective policies and \nhigh-impact interventions for the subsequent phase of the action plan. \n \n ", "  3 \n10.  Cost-effective policies and investments to achieve climate and air quality goals in the \nBTH  region  are  of  high  importance  for  the  government.  During  the  country  programming \nmeeting in August 2015 in Beijing, the government and ADB agreed to provide long-term and \nscaled-up support to address air quality issues in the BTH region. Immediate support includes \nthree TA  projects  and one  sovereign  loan  on  air  pollution,  balanced  economic  and  social \ndevelopment, and low-carbon transport. 6  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be carbon intensity reduction and air quality improvement in the BTH \nregion accelerated in accordance with the action plan.7 The outcome will be more cost-effective \npolicies and investments to improve air quality and reduce CO  emissions in the BTH region. \n2\n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The key outputs of the TA include (i) adequacy of model framework assessed and \nimproved;  (ii)  constraints  for  effective  policy  implementation  analyzed  and  synthesized; \n(iii) interplays of climate and air quality co-benefits in the BTH region and their sequencing \nassessed; and (iv) a set of policy recommendations and investment choices for the BTH region \nprepared. \n \n13.  Key activities under the TA include the following: \n(i)  adapt the integrated assessment framework of the China Regional Energy Model \n(C-REM) and the Regional Emission Air Quality Climate and Health (REACH) \nmodel for the BTH region to quantify in detail the expected benefits of existing \npolicies; 8 \n(ii)  prepare case studies of industry responses to climate and clean energy initiatives \nacross the BTH region to understand the financial and economic costs of existing \npolicies  and  barriers  that  delay  or  suboptimize  responses  to  climate,  clean \nenergy, and/or clean air policies at industry level; \n(iii)  synthesize case study results and adapt model parameters accordingly; \n(iv)  derive a stronger climate, clean energy, and air pollution policy coordination \nstrategy  that  integrates  plant-level  feedback  to  improve  and  enhance  policy \nformulation and specific investments; and \n                                                \n6   The three TA projects are (i) ADB. 2015.

Beijing. \n8   C-REM is a multiregion, multisector, recursive-dynamic, computable general equilibrium model that includes \nnational or subnational detail in the PRC. The primary goal of the model is to simulate existing and proposed \nenergy  and  climate  policies  in  the  PRC  to  analyze  their  impact  on  technology,  interfuel  competition,  the \nenvironment, and the economy within a global context. The REACH model enables the evaluation and projection \nof the cumulative effects of efforts to improve air quality on energy use, human health, and economic productivity. \nBoth models were co-developed by Tsinghua University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This \nmodel suite will be adjusted to the BTH region. Initial focus of the analysis will be the energy and transport \nsectors.  \n ", "4   \n(v)  identify cost-effective policy actions and investment flows that provide optimized \nand climate change mitigation and air quality impacts. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  emphasizes  support  for  achieving \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth.9 Strengthening  developing  member  countries\u2019  climate \nchange mitigation and low-carbon growth measures has been identified as one of the key \nmeans of addressing climate change issues. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nthe  PRC  identified  environmentally  sustainable  growth  as  one  of  the  three  pillars  of  ADB \nassistance to the PRC.10 The TA will promote cost-effective policy measures addressing CO\n2 \nemissions and air pollution reduction. \n \n15.  Major risks are (i) delay in the policy implementation of cost-effective policies in the BTH \nregion, (ii) local industry resistance to adopting the proposed policies, and (iii) difficulty in \nobtaining an accurate air pollution inventory for the region. To mitigate these risks, all policy- \nmaking agencies beyond the current executing and implementing agencies will be well informed \nand  consulted  when  developing  cost-effective  policies,  local  industries  will  be  included  in \ncapacity development training and workshops, and ADB and all executing and implementing \nagencies for various TA projects in support of clean air development in the BTH region will \nmaintain close coordination at all stages. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of remuneration and per diems for counterpart staff, \nincluding  counterpart  staff\u2019s  time,  remuneration  and  travel  expenses;  logistics  support  in \narranging workshops and conferences; a fully functional office; and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The  executing  agency will  be  the  MIIT\u2019s,  Department for  Energy  Conservation  and \nResources Utilization. The implementing agencies will be the provincial and municipal arms of \nMIIT entities in the BTH region. The collaboration with MIIT is important as the ministry will \n(i) facilitate access to industries and industrial managers for TA consultants, a key barrier for \nsuccessful  TA  implementation;  and  (ii)  be  instrumental  for  adopting  and  implementing \ncoordinated industrial transformation policies in the region. \n \n18.  Selection of a suitable model is the key to successful TA implementation. Selection of \nany model has to be through single-source selection because each model is proprietary and can \nbest be operated by its developers and owners. The proposed TA will use the C-REM\u2013REACH \nintegrated assessment framework (footnote 8), which proved valuable in formulating two recent \nADB studies on climate change in the PRC and is considered to be the most appropriate to \ncapture all key sectors and major contributors for air pollution and CO  emissions.11 Single-\n2\n                                                \n9   ADB. 2014.

Tsinghua \nexperts were engaged as individual consultants and through sub-contract, respectively, for conducting necessary \nmodelling and analysis.  \n ", "  5 \nsource selection of Tsinghua University, representing the Tsinghua\u2013Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology China Energy and Climate Project, is therefore appropriate and presents a clear \nadvantage over competition in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). To improve efficiency and value for money, consulting \nservices under the TA will be engaged on an output-based contract. Disbursements will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). Procurement under this TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  The  Tsinghua\u2013Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  team  will  provide  51  person-\nmonths of consulting services, which will involve three international consultants (15 person-\nmonths)  and  six  national  consultants  (36  person-months).  The  international  consultants \ncomprise  a  clean  energy\u2013clean  air  nexus  expert,  an  econometrician  with  experience  in \nquantitative economic research and modeling, as well as an energy and environmental policy \nexpert. The national consultants comprise (i) a clean energy\u2013clean air nexus expert, (ii) a \nproject coordinator, (iii) an environmental policy and management expert, (iv) an expert in air \nquality modeling and health impact, (v) a low-carbon energy and climate policy expert, and (vi) \nan  econometrician.  In  addition,  one  reputable  international  expert  in  quantitative  energy \neconomic research (4 person-months) shall be engaged through individual consultant selection \nto assess the model framework and review TA results from time to time, and act as a resource \nperson for TA workshops. The outline of the consultant terms of reference is in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  A cross-divisional TA team of ADB specialists will work with the consultants. The ADB \nteam will ensure a dialogue and an exchange of information between ADB and the consultants \nfor various TA projects in the BTH region to maximize information sharing, discussion of interim \nresults, and coordination of policy recommendations with ADB. \n \n21.  To ensure that relevant agencies benefit widely from TA outputs in their preparation of \nthe action plan\u2019s subsequent phase, an effective coordination mechanism will be established \nthrough which key ministries and government agencies with low-carbon and clean air policy-\nmaking  responsibilities  for  the  BTH  region  will  be  consulted  on  TA  outputs.12 High-level \nroundtables, workshops, and seminars will be organized, to which representatives of relevant \nagencies will be invited to share information on and discuss interim TA results. ADB and the \nexecuting agency will cooperate closely in organizing and managing these gatherings. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented from 11 January 2016 to 11 March 2018. The consultants \nwill be required to submit TA deliverables and progress reports on time. Detailed requirements \nfor deliverables and reports are included in the outline terms of reference for consultants in \nAppendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Developing Cost-Effective Policies and \nInvestments to Achieve Climate and Air Quality Goals in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Region, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n12  The key agencies involved will include the BTH coordination committee, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, \nthe Ministry of Finance, and the National Development and Reform Commission.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nI mpact the Project is Aligned with \nCarbon intensity reduction and air quality improvement in the BTH region accelerateda  \n(State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2013.
