INTRODUCTION \n1.  Disasters triggered by natural hazards slow long-term development and hamper efforts \nto reduce poverty in the developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). Government officials, policymakers, and insurance regulators from Asian DMCs who \nwere consulted during knowledge-sharing events on disaster risk financing (DRF) conveyed that \ninadequate financial arrangements delay early recovery and reconstruction efforts, exacerbating \nthe  indirect  and  secondary  consequences  of  direct  physical  losses.1 Tools  to  assess  and \nstrengthen the enabling environment for DRF would assist them in enhancing current practice.   \n \n2.  The regional research and development technical assistance (TA) has been prepared in \nclose consultation with the Finance Sector Group and the Climate Change and Disaster Risk \nManagement  Thematic  Group.2   In  selecting  the  countries  for  diagnostic  assessment,  the \nconsistency of the proposed TA with the relevant country partnership strategies will be ensured. \nThe TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, \n2014\u20132020, which supports \u201cthe development of DRF instruments and wider DRF strategies for \nhouseholds,  businesses,  and  governments,  enhancing  the  public  and  private  financial \nmanagement of residual disaster risk.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Asia and the Pacific is extremely vulnerable to natural hazards. From 2005 to 2014, \ndisasters have killed 427,000 people, affected 1.4 billion people, and caused direct physical \nlosses totaling $716 billion\u2014half of the global total.4 Disasters have had a devastating economic \nand social impact, not only resulting in damage to infrastructure, crops, and housing but also \nleading to the loss of government revenue, disruptions in trade and commerce, and market \ndestabilization. Immediately affected poor and near-poor households can continue to suffer \nadverse  effects  for  decades  as  livelihoods  are  disrupted,  limited  savings  eliminated,  debt \naccumulated, and children sometimes permanently withdrawn from education to boost earnings. \n \n4.  Confronted with the fiscal challenges that disasters present, policy makers are seeking \nto  strengthen  their  financial  management  to  ensure  that  populations,  businesses,  and \ngovernments have adequate resources to facilitate timely post-disaster response and to build \nback better, strengthening resilience to future hazard events. DRF instruments applied prior to a \ndisaster include disaster reserve funds; lines of contingent credit; and various risk transfer \nproducts involving insurance, reinsurance, and capital market solutions. DRF instruments turned \nto after a disaster include recurrent and capital budget reallocations, post-disaster borrowing, \ntax increases, and development partner assistance. \n                                                \n1  ADB in partnership with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) organized (i) ADB-\nOECD Forum on Disaster Risk Financing for Inclusive Development on 15\u201316 September 2015 in Manila, \nPhilippines; and (ii) Global Seminar on Disaster Risk Financing: Developing Effective Approaches to the Financial \nManagement of Disaster Risks on  17\u201318 September 2015 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to exchange knowledge and \npractices  on  financial  protection  against  disaster  risks  among  officials  and  experts  from  ADB,  Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, OECD, invited economies in Asia and elsewhere, \nand  the insurance industry. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 October 2015. The title of the TA \nwas renamed from Developing a Decision Making Tool for Introducing Disaster Risk Financing Products (Phase 1) \nfor a more accurate reflection of the focus of the TA.  \n3  ADB. 2014. Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020. Manila. p. 15. \n4 Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. International Disaster Database. http://www.emdat.be \n(accessed 8 June 2015). \n ", "2   \n5.  The  selection  of  DRF  instruments  should  be  based  on  a  rigorous  disaster  risk \nassessment, establishing expected levels of loss for hazards of varying types, intensities, and \nreturn periods. The most appropriate set of DRF instruments will depend on a range of factors, \nincluding the scale of funding required for each layer of loss, the speed with which disbursement \nof funding is required, and the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative instruments for specific \nlayers of loss. DRF instruments can also provide price signals to help guide decisions on \nspecific disaster risk reduction investments and on the balance of resource allocation between \ndisaster risk reduction and response. Via the application of risk-based pricing methodologies, \nDRF instruments can be used to incentivize investments in risk reduction as well. \n \n6.  However, few, if any, countries in Asia and the Pacific have a comprehensive DRF \nstrategy in place. Insured disaster losses typically account for only a few percentage points of \ntotal disaster losses each year in ADB\u2019s DMCs. This reflects a series of demand and supply \nconstraints. Demand constraints include issues around limited awareness of DRF products, \nweak financial literacy, lack of trust in risk transfer products, and budgetary constraints. Supply \nconstraints include legal and regulatory gaps, disaster risk, loss and financial data limitations, \nand insurance industry capital requirement deficiencies. Consequently, in the aftermath of a \ndisaster, many countries have insufficient access to financing to facilitate timely recovery and \nreconstruction  efforts.  Implied  funding  delays  exacerbate  the  indirect  and  secondary \nconsequences of disasters significantly. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be a contribution toward strengthening the fiscal resilience of ADB\u2019s \nDMCs  to  disaster  risk  by  enhancing  financing  arrangements  for  post  disaster  relief.  The \noutcome will be increased commitment of DMCs to strengthen the enabling environment for \nDRF instruments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will develop tools to assess and strengthen the enabling environment for DRF \nand will strengthen the DRF capacity of DMC stakeholders. The tools will include a diagnostics \nmethodology to assess the current DRF landscape and enabling environment in ADB\u2019s DMCs; \nand  a  tool  kit  of  actions  to  strengthen  the  enabling  environment  for  DRF,  supporting  the \nestablishment of comprehensive DRF strategies linked to solvent risk transfer markets. The \ndiagnostics methodology and enabling environment tool kit will be based on the findings of \ndiagnostic assessments of two DMCs\u2014one in South Asia and one in Central and West Asia.5  \n \n9.  The assessments will explore the current application of DRF solutions in the selected \nDMCs,  related  demand  and  supply  constraints,  and  opportunities  to  strengthen  the  DRF \nenabling environment\u2014leading to the enhanced financial management of disaster risk. The \nassessments will include a review of sovereign and subsovereign DRF solutions available and \nutilized in recent disaster events, government contingent liability, public funding gaps (drawing \non available risk assessment data), and the short- and long-term fiscal consequences of past \ndisasters. They will also review private sector disaster insurance markets, covering home, \n                                                \n5 Country selection will be in consultation with ADB operations departments and confirmed following government \nclearance, subsequent to TA approval.   \n ", "  3 \nbusiness,  agricultural,  and  micro-insurance  cover.  The  assessments  will  examine  DRF \ninstitutional  arrangements (including formal  and  informal  mechanisms between  federal  and \nprovincial government ministries, departments, and authorities) and regulatory, legislative, and \ntax regimes. They will review levels of disaster insurance penetration; the types of coverage \navailable;  premium  rates  and  underlying  pricing  methodologies;  distribution  channels  and \nattendant costs; underwriting and claims administration practices; and prevailing reinsurance \npractices and local reinsurance capacity. The availability and quality of historical loss, hazard, \nand exposure data and the extent and scope of existing disaster risk models data will be \nexamined. Country initiatives will be examined to promote micro-insurance, Takaful (Islamic) \ninsurance, financial literacy, and risk awareness to incentivize the take up of DRF products.  \n  \n10.  On  completion  of  each  country  diagnostic  assessment,  the  findings  and \nrecommendations will be disseminated to stakeholders. In close coordination with the respective \nregional departments, a dialogue will be initiated with the two DMCs\u2014focusing on DRF gaps, \npolicy  options  to  strengthen  fiscal  resilience,  potential  new  DRF  instruments  (including \nopportunities for both strengthened public and private management of disaster risk), and the \nmeasures required to enhance the DRF enabling environment, including possible legislative and \nregulatory  adjustments  and  capacity-building  initiatives.  DRF  training  sessions  will  also  be \nconducted to facilitate each DMC\u2019s understanding of DRF concepts, principles, and instruments; \nto disseminate study findings and recommendations; and to promote ownership of action plans \nfor their implementation. \n \n11.  Outputs from the study will be compiled into a how-to guide for strengthening the DRF \nenabling environment, which will include the diagnostics methodology, the enabling environment \ntool  kit.  The  diagnostic  methodology  will  include  identifying  options  for  risk  modeling  and \nactuarial analysis to derive risk-based premiums, and case study examples of the guide\u2019s \napplication to the two country studies, including resulting action plans. The guide will also \ninclude a broad overview of the case for strengthening the enabling environment for DRF in \nADB\u2019s DMCs. \n \n12.  The TA will include a program of training and knowledge events for government officials \nand stakeholders at country and regional levels to raise understanding of DRF and support \nongoing efforts to augment ADB\u2019s program of work in DRF, including possible partnerships with \nthe private sector. \n \n13.  The TA outputs are expected to spur other ADB projects supporting DMCs to strengthen \ntheir  DRF  enabling  environments  and  capacity,  including  via  the  introduction  of  new  DRF \ninstruments. Building on lessons learned from the TA, a second phase will be considered \nsubject to resource availability, to apply the diagnostic methodology in other interested DMCs \nand assist them in developing suitable DRF instruments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and $100,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15. The TA is expected to be completed in 24 months from January 2016 to December \n2017. ADB will be the executing agency. The Sector Advisory Service Division and the Climate \n ", "4   \nChange  and  Disaster  Risk  Management  Division  of  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Development  and \nClimate Change Department will share the role of implementing agency. TA administration and \nsupervision, implementation oversight, accountability for the outputs, and communication with \nconsultants  and  stakeholders  will  be  carried  out  jointly  by  these  two  divisions,  in  close \ncoordination  with  the  Finance  Sector  Group  and  the  Climate  Change  and  Disaster  Risk \nManagement Thematic Group. Team members from the Central and West Asia Department and \nthe South Asia Department will also be involved in TA implementation. A focal agency will be \nidentified in each of the two selected DMCs to provide advice to the consultants and to serve as \nthe primary point of contact with stakeholders. The focal agencies will be kept fully informed of \n \nprogress under the TA.\n \n16.  The TA will require 18 person-months of individual international consultant services and \n26 person-months of individual national consultant services, comprising (i) 6 person-months for \none lead disaster risk financing specialist, (ii) 4 person-months for one disaster risk insurance \nspecialist, (iii) 4 person-months for one agricultural insurance specialist, (iv) 4 person-months for \none insurance and capital markets regulatory specialist, (v) 8 person-months for two national \ndisaster risk financing specialists, (vi) 8 person-months for two national insurance industry \nspecialists, and (vii) 10 person-months for one national project coordinator. \n \n17.  Recruitment of consultants will be undertaken on an individual basis in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursement under the TA project will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). An ADB staff team from the Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange Department will regularly monitor and administer the individual contracts and manage \nthe combined outputs to achieve the TA objectives. In the event that ADB staff act as project \nresource persons, travel costs will be charged to the TA but their salaries and benefits will be \nabsorbed by the internal administrative expense budget.6 \n \n18.  ADB will disseminate outputs of the study to DMCs and within ADB, and carry out other \nfollow-up  activities  for  preparing  relevant  ADB\u2019s  project  proposals  as  required.  Strong \ncollaboration with regional departments\u2014particularly from Central and West Asia and South \nAsia\u2014together with private sector operations, will be essential to facilitate access to key DMC \nstakeholders  and  information  and  to  ensure  strong  understanding  of  financial  and  capital \nmarkets in the case study countries. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening the Enabling Environment for Disaster Risk Financing (Phase 1), and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n6  A memo from the Budget, Personnel, and Management Systems Department and the Strategy and Policy \nDepartment (26 June 2013) provides guidance on charging costs to TA and internal administrative expense \nbudgets. It states that for preparatory works, implementation, and administrative support, ADB staff is not eligible to \ncharge corresponding salaries and benefits to the TA. However, if the TA paper clearly specifies and includes \nprovision in its cost estimates to provide support services, such as travel and administrative expenses, then such \ncosts should be charged to the TA. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nFiscal resilience of ADB\u2019s DMCs to disaster risk is strengthened (Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk \nManagement, 2014\u20132020)a  \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nCommitment of DMCs  Two targeted countries have  Government administrative  Changes to political and \nto strengthen the  taken measures to address  orders  macroeconomic \nenabling environment  current gaps and  environment could create \nfor disaster risk  shortcomings based on their  barriers to the adoption of \nfinancing instruments  action plans by 2020  the action plans. \nincreased  (Baseline 2014: 0). \n   \nOutputs       \n1.
