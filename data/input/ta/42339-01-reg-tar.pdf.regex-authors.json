INTRODUCTION \n1.  The 1997 Asian financial crisis showed that an overdependence on the banking sector \ncould make the entire financial system highly vulnerable. At that time, overdependence on bank \nfinancing had forced borrowers to be exposed to excessive short-term foreign exchange risk \nwhen financing long-term projects where the revenues were denominated in local currency.  \nSuch currency and maturity mismatches contributed to the Asian financial crisis as capital \ninflows came to a sudden stop and capital flight occurred. It demonstrated that an alternative \nfunding source to short-term bank loans needed to be developed. \n2.  Based  on  the  lessons  from  the  crisis,  ASEAN+3  (Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations, the People's Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea) launched the Asian \nBond Markets Initiative (ABMI) in 2003 to develop local currency bond markets in Asia as an \nalternative funding source to short-term bank loans in either local or foreign currencies. The goal \nof ABMI is to strengthen local currency bond markets to improve the resilience of financial \nsystems, prevent maturity and currency mismatches, and help mobilize the region\u2019s abundant \nsavings to finance long-term investments.  \n3.  In addition to the rapid growth of the ASEAN+3 bond markets, shares held by foreign \ninvestors have recently increased. If this trend continues, it will promote the diversification of \nmarket participants, thereby contributing to enhance the stability of those bond markets. In \nterms of promoting the diversification of market participants, legal frameworks and business \npractices need to be harmonized in bond markets across the region to reduce the cost and risk \nof bond transactions and bond holdings. This will also contribute to the further growth of the \nbond markets and market integration in ASEAN+3. \n4.  The ABMI has focused on four areas: (i) promoting the issuance of bonds denominated \nin  local  currency,  (ii)  facilitating  the  demand  for  such  bonds,  (iii) improving  the  regulatory \nframework,  and  (iv)  improving  related  infrastructure  for  bond  markets.  Task  forces  were \nestablished under each of the four key areas.     \n5.  One of the priority activities for Task Force 4, which is responsible for improving related \ninfrastructure, is increasing the liquidity of bond markets by establishing effective primary dealer \nsystems in the ASEAN+3 countries. These countries have requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to (i) assess the necessity, feasibility, and cost \nand benefits of establishing primary dealer systems in the countries where no such system \nexists, or (ii) improve existing primary dealer systems. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. The TA will be implemented in line with the work plan of Task Force 4. The \nconcept paper of the TA was approved on 29 July 2009.1 \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 1 February 2010. \n ", "2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.        Role of Government Bonds \n \n6.  As government bonds play a pivotal and dominant role in not only bond markets but also \nfinancial markets and serve as a critical tool for government financing, the governments in the \nregion have reformed their bond markets in recent years, supported by several development \npartners,  including ADB.  The development of government bond  markets  is  also  crucial  to \nachieving the ABMI\u2019s goal of promoting growth and stability in domestic and regional bond \nmarkets.  \n7.  In most countries, the government bond market is the most important market in the \nfinancial system because of its dominant size and its role in debt financing. Government bonds \ncomprised 71.2% of the total local currency bond outstanding at the end of September 2009 in \nthe ASEAN countries, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea. Banks and \nother financial institutions such as insurance companies and pension funds invest and trade in \ngovernment bonds for asset, liquidity, and risk management purposes. Government bonds are \ncommonly used as a monetary policy tool by central banks. They also function as the pricing \nbenchmark  for  corporate  bonds  and  reveal  information  on  current  and  future  monetary \nconditions as reflected in its interest rate movements.  \nB.   Liquidity of the Government Bond Market \n \n8.  For the primary market to function effectively, the government has to consider the timing \nand frequency of bond issuances, and the type, maturity, and coupon rate of bonds based on \ninvestors' needs by keeping a close relationship and communication with dealers and investors. \nThe government also needs to continue issuing bonds to provide liquidity, help create a series \nof benchmarks, and promote the sustainable development of the bond market, in addition to \nfinancing their financial needs and expenditures. The issuing method, including auctions and \nsyndicated underwriting, should be market-based, and reopening and buyback schemes are \nalso needed to enhance liquidity. The government has to disclose bond issuance information, \nincluding the issuance schedule, the volume by maturity, and the lot and frequency of each \nissuance, and to announce auction and underwriting results. These are needed to improve the \ntransparency of government bond issuances and enhance the predictability of bond issuances \nfor dealers and investors.  \n \n9.  For bond dealers and investors, liquidity in a secondary market is highly desirable. A \ndeep and liquid secondary market helps strengthen the confidence of investors and dealers in \ntheir purchase of bonds in a primary market, as they know they will be able to trade the bonds \neasily in the secondary market with little or no impact on market prices. Active transactions can \nhelp to promote broader participation by and diversification of dealers and investors, reduce bid \nand ask price spreads, and lower financing costs for bond issuers. Liquid bond markets can also \npromote fair pricing through competition among dealers and can contribute to the formation of a \nreliable yield curve as a pricing benchmark.  \n \n10.  The liquidity in a secondary market is enhanced by active market-making operations by \ndealers and investors. Market-making operations are supported by a diversified base of market \nintermediaries and institutional investors, appropriate instruments and transaction methods, and \na systematic framework for bond transactions. A certain minimum level of market liquidity and \n ", "  3 \nreliable benchmarks are critical because they enable market participants to trade and invest in a \nfair and transparent manner and improve the price discovery function. In addition to regular \nissuance of benchmark bonds, reopening and refinancing operations by the government enable \nfragmented markets to be consolidated and standardized to maintain minimum liquidity. A stable \nclearance and settlement system is an important market infrastructure for active trading among \ndealers, and \"delivery versus payment\" settlement is the best practice because it can reduce \ncounterparty  risk  and  transaction  costs.  Complementary  market  infrastructures,  such  as  a \nrepurchase agreement (repo) market, and derivatives and futures markets for risk hedging, \nneed to be developed to enable dealers to trade smoothly in a secondary market and to build a \nlarge  inventory  of  bonds,  and  investors  to  take  a  large  and  long  position  in  their  bond \ninvestments.  \n \n11.  Transparency  is  important  for  improving  liquidity  in  a  secondary  market  and  an \ninformation dissemination scheme for bond transactions needs to be developed. The majority of \nbond trading is carried out through over-the-counter markets, which are not so transparent and \ncan impede the price discovery function. To enhance transparency and promote trading in a \nsecondary market, adequate pre- and post-trade price information needs to be disclosed. On \nthe other hand, some information, including the proposed bid and ask prices by dealers to their \nclients in pre-trade should be confidential and individual market participants should remain \nanonymous. Disclosure of such information could hamper market-making operations by dealers. \nAnonymity is also an important factor in both pre- and post-trade stages because disclosing \nsuch information would enable dealers' and investors' positions and strategies to be guessed, \nimpeding their active transaction and intermediation. It is necessary to assess the type of \ninformation to be gathered and disclosed in line with best practices on effective information \ndissemination. \n \nC.   Primary Dealer System \n \n12.  A primary dealer system is a group of selected dealers given some exclusive privileges, \nsuch  as access  to  primary  issuance or other special auctions  and participation  in  special \nmeetings  with  the  government,  in  exchange  for  the  obligations  of  (i)  full  participation  in \ngovernment bond auctions in a substantial and consistent manner of bidding and purchasing, (ii) \nconducting market-making in a secondary market by proposing competitive bid and ask prices, \nand (iii) reporting and providing market information and advice to the government.  \n \n13.  In the early stage of the bond market development when the investor base is thin and \nthe expertise and resources needed to develop the bond market are scarce, the primary market \noften cannot absorb the supply of government bonds efficiently because of the large size of \ngovernment bond issuances. Although underwriting by a special syndicate or private placement \ncontributes to the government's financing in a primary market, these types of issuance can \nimpede liquidity in a secondary market as they tend to place government bonds directly to \ninvestors or last holders without trading though dealers. The government bond issuance should \nbe  shifted from  underwriting and/or private  placement  to  auction  in order  to enhance  the \neffectiveness of market making operation by dealers. A primary dealer system can be an \neffective solution to ensure government bond issuances through auctions because the system \nimposes primary dealers to bid and purchase newly issued bonds substantially in auctions. In \naddition, by requiring primary dealers to trade government bonds competitively in a secondary \nmarket as one of the obligations of their membership, a primary dealer system can help to \nimprove liquidity in the government bond markets. The feasibility of market-making operations \nby primary dealers is a key determinant for the introduction of a primary dealer system to \nimprove liquidity in the government bond market. Market-making operations can be supported \n ", "4   \nby  (i)  a  certain  amount  of  liquidity  and  a  series  of  benchmarks;  (ii)  market  infrastructure \nsupporting bond transactions,  including a  stable  clearance and  settlement  system, a  repo \nmarket, and a futures and derivatives market; and (iii) appropriate disclosure of information, \nincluding anonymous trading in bond transactions. \n \n14.  There  is a  risk  that a primary  dealer  system could  lead  to  a collusive  group  with \nexclusive privileges. To ensure a competitive primary dealer system, it is necessary to require \nprimary dealers to meet their obligations including competitive bidding and purchasing. Their \nperformance in market-making operations in a secondary market needs to be closely monitored. \nThe government needs to develop a monitoring and reporting system and to enhance its \nmonitoring capacity because it is difficult to monitor primary dealers' market-making operations if \nmost bond transactions are conducted in the over-the-counter market.  \n \n15.  Although some of the ASEAN+3 countries have introduced a primary dealer system and \nhave  succeeded  in  stable  financing  and  liquidity  enhancement,  others  have  either  not \nintroduced a primary dealer system or have the systems that are not functioning well. In some \ncases, minimum liquidity, dealers and investors base, and supporting market infrastructures \nhave not matured enough to allow primary dealers to assume the responsibility of market-\nmaking. In other cases, as the responsibilities and privileges of a primary dealer are not well \nbalanced, there is little incentive for a dealer to be qualified as a primary dealer. In others, \ncompetition among primary dealers for market-making operations is not maintained due to the \nlack of adequate monitoring system.      \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact of the TA will be comprehensive development of domestic and regional bond \nmarkets in ASEAN+3 countries as an alternative funding source that will reduce borrowers' \ndependency on short-term bank loans and minimize currency and maturity mismatches. The \noutcome of the TA is expected to improve liquidity of the government bond markets through the \nestablishment or strengthening of effective primary dealer systems. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  Design a primary dealer system for countries that do not have such systems.  The \nTA will comprehensively examine the necessity, feasibility, and costs and benefits of introducing \na primary dealer system into the countries that do not have such systems. It will also assess the \ndevelopment and maturity of each bond market, focusing on the extent to which bond dealers \ncan conduct adequate market-making operations. The assessment will review the government \nbond issuance policy, issuance methods in a primary market, the level of minimum liquidity, \nrelevant market infrastructures including a trading style or platform, a repo market, derivatives \nand futures  market,  and a  clearing and  settlement  system; and  an  information disclosure \nscheme. Based on the assessment, the TA will develop an action plan to introduce a primary \ndealer system, or an alternative approach to enhancing market-making functions and improving \nthe liquidity of bond markets.  \n \n18.  Strengthen an existing primary dealer system.  The TA will examine the performance \nof existing primary dealer systems, in terms of the effectiveness of the market-making function. \nIt will identify the advantages and disadvantages of primary systems, and the factors that \naccount for weaknesses and strengths of them. The TA will focus on the competitiveness of \n ", "  5 \nmarket-making operations among primary dealers and will assess regulatory measures to keep \nthe primary dealer system contestable and the performance monitoring system to ensure their \nmarket-making operations. The government bond issuance policy and market infrastructure to \nsupport market-making operations will be reviewed. Based on this assessment, the TA will \npropose policy recommendations to strengthen existing primary dealer systems in the context of \nenhancing market-making operations and improving liquidity in a secondary market.  \n \n19.  A workshop to disseminate the outcomes of the TA and a training on how to establish or \nimprove a primary dealer system will be held for government officials and market participants in \nASEAN+3 member countries. The outcomes of the TA and the reports will be shared with \nmember countries at the ABMI meeting and other dissemination seminars. \n \n20.  The TA will target the bond markets of ASEAN, the People's Republic of China, and the \nRepublic  of  Korea.  ADB  has  been  providing  continuous  country-level  assistance  for  bond \nmarket development to a number of countries in ASEAN and these have been based on \nstrategies such as the financial sector road map of each country partnership strategy and \nsustained policy dialogue by the Southeast Asia Department. The TA will be designed and \nimplemented so that it is consistent with these strategies, ongoing projects, and the outputs of \nprevious assistance.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by the \nInvestment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \nPartnership Facility,2 and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The  TA  will  be  administered  by  the  Office  of  Regional  Economic  Integration  in \ncoordination with ASEAN+3 under the ABMI Task Force 4 work plan. The Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration will also cooperate with the Southeast Asia Department and will exchange \ninformation  on  bond  markets  in  the  ASEAN+3  countries.  The  TA  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with the ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.3 The design and \nmonitoring  framework  in  Appendix  1  will  be  used  to  track  and  evaluate  progress  in \nimplementation. The TA will be implemented over 20 months and is expected to begin in May \n2010 and be completed by December 2011.  \n \n23.  The TA will require 20 person-months of international consulting services and 20 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. The consultants will be engaged by ADB as individual \nconsultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The international consultants will include a bond market specialist, who will \nplay the role of team leader, and a capital market infrastructure specialist. National consultants \nwith expertise in the same areas will be engaged for the same length of time to provide support \nto the international consultants. Outline of the terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix \n3.    \n \n                                                \n2  Established by the Government of Japan. \n3  ADB. 2008.

The consultants will \nsubmit (i) an inception report, within 1 month after the TA commencement; (ii) an interim \nprogress  report,  including  an assessment of the  current  situation  of  each  bond  market  in \nASEAN, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea, (iii) a draft final report 16 \nmonths after TA commencement, and (iv) a final report after receiving comments from member \ncountries in ASEAN+3 and ADB. The progress of the TA will be discussed at the ABMI Task \nForce 4 meeting and reported to the ABMI steering meeting. The results and outputs will be \nshared  with  relevant  government  officials  and  market  participants  through  dissemination \nseminars and workshops as well as with ABMI member countries.   \n \nIV.
