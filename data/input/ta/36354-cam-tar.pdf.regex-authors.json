INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Cambodia has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare the Transport Infrastructure Development and Maintenance Project, \nwhich will cover (i) improvement of about 230 kilometers (km) of priority secondary national \nroads,  (ii)  essential  road  maintenance  on  the  national  road  system,  and  (iii)  road  safety \nimprovements. The TA is included in the Country Strategy and Program for Cambodia 2005\u2013\n2009.1 The Fact-Finding Mission visited Cambodia from 31 January to 7 February 2005 to \nobtain  the  Government\u2019s  concurrence  on  the  goals,  purpose,  scope,  implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA.2 Another \nmission visited Cambodia from 24 June to 4 July 2005 for additional discussions on the TA with \nthe Government. A preliminary TA design and monitoring framework is given in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Cambodia\u2019s transport system suffered severe damage during the years of civil strife. \nMost of the road network was rendered impassable. ADB,3 World Bank, and other development \nagencies  have  invested  substantial  resources  in  rehabilitating  the  primary  national  roads \nnetwork.  As  a  result,  most  of  the  country\u2019s  core  access  network  has  been  reestablished. \nSimilarly, development agencies and the Government have expended substantial resources on \nrehabilitating rural infrastructure, including rural roads, to enable resettlement of the many \ndisplaced people and recovery of agriculture. Until recently, however, the secondary national \nnetwork, which links provinces to the national network and provides intraprovincial linkages to \nthe tertiary and rural network, and so to Cambodia\u2019s still largely rural population, has received \nlittle attention. The result is that the road network is split into two networks of primary and \ntertiary roads, respectively, that are only loosely and unreliably interconnected. The situation \nhinders the development of cash crop production in the rural areas, where markets in many \nplaces are limited to the local area due to lack of access. It also leaves provincial centers and \nnumerous natural and cultural sites with tourism potential inaccessible from the outside world, \nand it imposes substantial diversion cost on the transport system because many routes that are \nimportant for bilateral cross-border trade are inaccessible and must be circumvented by going \nvia border crossings served by a primary road. \n \n3.  As the improved road network extends further throughout the country, and as the rural \neconomy comes to depend more and more on it, the network\u2019s long-term sustainability is \nbecoming an issue. In this context, lack of adequate road maintenance is becoming a concern. \nThe Government is aware of this and, in 2000, addressed the issue by establishing the Fund for \nRepair and Maintenance of Roads (FRMR), which is a road fund financed from surcharges on \nfuel. Although the FRMR is functioning, it will take about 10 years before road sector revenues \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion: Cambodia Road Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 1945-CAM). ADB\u2019s project \nroads include National Road (NR) 1 (Neak Leoung\u2013Bavet) under Loan 1659-CAM, NR5 (Kampong Chnang\u2013\nBattambang), NR6 (Kampong Thom\u2013the provincial boundary between Seam Reap and Kampong Thom), and NR7 \n(Tonle Bet\u2013Kratie) under Loan 1697-CAM; and NR5 (Sisophon\u2013Poipet) and NR6 (Siem Reap\u2013Sisophon) under \nLoan 1945-CAM. \n ", "2   \nreach a level where they can fully finance road maintenance needs. The reason is a small \nrevenue  base  due  to  low  traffic  levels.  The  most  immediate  problem,  however,  is  that \ndisbursements from the existing FRMR resources have been inadequate, partly because of a \nlack of contractors that can execute the works, partly because of lack of technical standards \nand  central-level  maintenance  management  expertise,  and  partly  because  of  insufficient \ncapacity for maintenance planning and management in the provinces, which are responsible for \nmaintaining most national and provincial roads. ADB has provided the Ministry of Public Works \nand Transport (MPWT), the agency with overall responsibility for the country\u2019s transport system, \nwith  policies  and  technical  standards  for  road  maintenance  management, 4  and  ADB, \nInternational  Labor  Organization,  and  World  Bank  are  executing  pilot  road  maintenance \nmanagement projects5 in six provinces to test practical means of strengthening provincial road \nmanagement. More will however be needed to secure a sustained road maintenance program. \n \n4.  In the context of road network sustainability, MPWT has expressed concern about the \nappropriateness  of  construction  techniques  adopted  for  pavement  construction  in  previous \nprojects. On sections of rehabilitated roads, pavements have deteriorated more rapidly than \nwould normally be expected. It is not clear whether these problems are due to shortcomings in \ndesign, construction quality, or unforeseen changes in traffic. This issue will be studied under \nthe TA, and technical standards for rehabilitation and maintenance works that address these \nconcerns will be developed and implemented in the ensuing project.  \n \n5.  Finally, deteriorating road safety is a growing concern. In 2003, about 1,000 deaths and \n20,000 serious injuries were recorded in Cambodia. Compared with the figure for 2000, the total \nnumber of accidents increased by 14% while the number of fatalities increased by 77%. From \nwork done in similar developing countries, it can be assumed that road accidents cost the \ncountry annually between 1% and 3% of the gross domestic product. Moreover, traffic accidents \ndisproportionately impact on pedestrians and cyclists, typically from the poorer levels of society. \nThus, for economic and social reasons, Cambodia\u2019s rapidly worsening road safety situation \nneeds to be addressed while it is still manageable. In this context, ADB and the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations have launched a joint regional road safety program6 that is recording \nbest practices for road safety improvement and disseminating them to countries in the region.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  outcome  of  the  resulting  Project  and  the  impact  of  this  TA  will  be  to  initiate \nrehabilitation  of  the  network  of  secondary  national  roads  to  reestablish  dependable  and \neconomically efficient links between the rural roads networks and the primary national roads \nnetwork. The Project will (i) provide reliable all-year road access from provincial towns and rural \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 1999.

The roads will promote economic development in rural areas and provincial \ncenters and facilitate social development by reducing remoteness (Appendix 2). The Project will \nachieve this by improving selected secondary national highways, specifically: (i) rehabilitating \nNational Road (NR) 33 from Kampong Trach to Lork (17 km) and upgrading the border post;7 (ii) \nrehabilitating NR56 from Sisophon to Samraong (114 km), (iii) rehabilitating NR68 from Kralanh \nto  O\u2019smach  (79  km)  and  upgrading  the  border  post;  (iv)  improving  NR72  from  Kreak  to \nTrapeang Phlong Pir (14 km) and upgrading the border post, a total of about 230 km. These \nroad links have been selected in consultation with the Government, after assessing traffic \ndemand; linkages to existing areas with high agricultural potential for contract farming, for \nexample, but with poor access; and linkages to areas of cultural and tourism interest.  \n \n7.  The Project will also ensure a sustainable maintenance works program by developing an \napproach to effectively utilizing the FRMR. The institutional structure of the Government for \nplanning and delivery of road maintenance services, already in place but inadequate for the \ndemands placed on it, will be strengthened. Road maintenance skills of local contractors and \ncost efficiency of road maintenance works will be improved.  \n \n8.  In summary, the TA will enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the roads sector by \n(i) preparing the Project for immediate rehabilitation of the identified secondary national roads \nand three important secondary border crossings (para. 6), (ii) preparing a proposal for medium-\nterm ADB funding of secondary road rehabilitation, (iii) identifying supplementary funding for \nroad maintenance and promoting improved disbursement and effective use of these funds, \n(iv) assisting the Government in implementing its road safety action plan, and (v) undertaking a \nstudy to investigate the causes of road pavement defects. \n \n9.  Specifically, the output of the project preparation component of the TA will include (i) a \npreliminary design for rehabilitating the identified secondary national roads (para. 6) based on \nthe road pavement defects study and preliminary design for the three border-crossing facilities; \n(ii)  economic  project  analysis  including  sensitivity  and  project  risk  analyses;  (iii) an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE);  (iv)  a  resettlement  plan  (RP);  (v)  an  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment plan (EMDP), if required; (vi) technical, financial, and institutional analyses of road \nmaintenance  planning  and  implementation;  (vii) contract  documents  for  design-build  road \nrehabilitation works and for road maintenance works; and (viii) a component to assist the \nGovernment in implementing its road safety action plan.  \n \n10.  The advisory component of the TA will prepare (i) a proposal for a future ADB-supported \nprogram for rehabilitating secondary national roads over the next 10 years, (ii) an action plan for \nrestructuring and financing road maintenance, and (iii) a program for countrywide road safety \ninitiatives.  \n \n                                                 \n7 While NR33 is an integral part of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Southern Coastal Corridor, only the 17-km \nsection has not yet been improved.

Manila (TA 6235-REG) will examine the \neconomic feasibility of the 17 km section. \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  A team comprising experienced individual consultants will make a feasibility analysis for \nproject preparation, which will cover engineering, economic, social, and environmental aspects. \nThe engineering study will include geological, topographical, hydrological, unexploded ordnance \n(UXO) surveys; pavement design; and detailed cost estimates. The economic study will assess \nthe economic feasibility of the Project. The social and environmental study will prepare an RP \nand an EMDP if required for the Project, and conduct an IEE. A final report will consolidate \nthese  outputs.  The  consultants  will  also  assist  MPWT  in  resettlement  activities,  including \nundertaking  detailed  measurement  surveys,  updating  the  RP,  and  monitoring  resettlement \nactivities. The consultants will assist the Government in holding coordination meetings with the \ngovernments of Thailand and Viet Nam to discuss the cross-border facilities along NR33, NR68, \nand NR72, in line with the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Cross-Border Agreement and its \nAnnexes and Protocols8, and prepare work packages and cost estimates for undertaking civil \nworks for the cross-border facilities.  \n \n12.  The road maintenance planning study will assist the Government to (i) formulate an \naction plan for replication of pilot road maintenance projects nationwide and for associated \nreform  of  central  road  maintenance  planning  and  maintenance  funding  mechanisms; \n(ii) propose a strategy for developing domestic contractor capacity; and (iii) identify additional \nroad sector-based revenue sources, such as road tolls, and sources of interim funding, such as \nloans that can be tapped until traffic has grown to a point where road sector revenues can cover \nroad maintenance needs. This work will be supplemented by a study to investigate pavement \ndefects. The study will identify the causes of those defects across the design, construction, and \noperational phases of roads that have been rehabilitated within the last 10 years. The objective \nwill be to identify the causes of those defects and to propose appropriate measures to be \nincorporated in the design, construction, and operation of new projects.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,180,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance \n$1,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government of Cambodia will finance $180,000 \nequivalent to cover counterpart staff, provide office accommodation for the TA consultant team, \nand provide necessary inputs in kind: data, statistics, reports, and maps. The Government has \nbeen informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan for the TA are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MPWT. MPWT has designated the General \nDepartment of Public Works (GDPW) as the implementing unit. The director general of GDPW \nwill have overall responsibility for implementing the TA, and will provide guidance, technical \nsupport, counterpart staff, documentation, and other services that may be required. GDPW will \nset up a subunit suitably staffed with counterpart personnel for day-to-day coordination and to \nwork  with  the  TA  consultants  and  other  government  agencies,  particularly  the  Ministry  of \nEconomy and Finance, provincial public works departments, nongovernment organizations, and \nother interested parties.  \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2003.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n     \nIs the sector identified as a national \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes    Yes \npriority in country poverty partnership \npriority in country poverty analysis?       \nagreement?   \n      No       No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nImprovements in the infrastructure sector will strengthen linkages between rural and urban areas and \nbetween regions of the country, and promote economic growth and development activities that are \ngeographically balanced. \n \nThe majority of the poor in Cambodia live in rural areas and their livelihood activities are based on \nagriculture. Many face food shortages for several months and are vulnerable to external shocks due to \ntheir reliance on subsistence agriculture and lack of access to social services. Improved infrastructure will \nlead to increased openness for communities deprived of adequate access to information, markets, off-farm \nemployment, and social services. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis       Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nIn connection with the ongoing Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS): Cambodia Road Improvement Project1 \n(CRIP) covering road rehabilitation of National Road (NR) 5 and NR6, and the repair and replacement of \nabout 50 bridges in NR68 and NR56 in the provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Oddar Meanchey, and Siem \nReap, a study using socioeconomic survey and focus group discussion methods was conducted in 2002 to \ninvestigate poverty and vulnerability and likely impacts of increased access.2    \n \nFindings of the study suggest that poverty is widespread in the area and accessibility is a severe problem \nduring the rainy season. No less than 60% of the households suffer from food deficiency. Most households \nfind their food stocks depleted within 4 months of harvest. The overall poverty estimates for the project \narea was 40%, and areas serviced by poor roads like NR56 and NR68 have very high poverty levels of \nover 60%. Livelihood security is a chief concern of the poorest 40%. They are primarily subsistence \nfarmers growing one (rain-fed) crop a year, often of low quality or yields. \n \nThe incidence of disabled persons is high (2.2 per 1,000 compared with the national average of 1.5), and \nreflects the prolonged civil strife and the presence of unexploded ordnance (UXO) in the area.  Indigenous \nethnic minorities are not found in the immediate project area, as war and insecurity led them to move \nnortheast.   \n \nTransport and Employment  \n \nNR68 and NR56, which begin from NR6 in Kralanh and Sisophon, respectively, and meet in Samraong \nthus forming a loop, will directly feed into the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed Northwestern \nRural Development Project3 (NRDP). The proposed rehabilitation of NR68 and NR56 will enhance the \npoverty impacts of the CRIP and the NRDP. In line with the objectives of the CRIP, the rehabilitation of \nNR68 and NR56 will strengthen the linkage of feeder roads under the NRDP and the national roads. This \nwould increase the poverty reduction effects of NRDP, CRIP, and the proposed project. \n \nRecent studies of the impact of feeder roads show that the competitiveness of transport facilities has an \nimportant effect on poverty reduction. In a competitive environment, reduced vehicle operating costs will \nbenefit users of transport facilities. Key impacts include higher prices for producers and a wider span of \nmarketing options for agricultural produce, and increased opportunity for trade to reduce food shortages. \nAccess to NR5 and NR6, a main trade route with growing markets, will further increase farmers\u2019 abilities to \nreach a variety of markets. All-year access along NR68 and NR56 and into the target villages of the NRDP \nwill reduce the costs of accessing social services like health care and education. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nThe most immediate impact of the proposed project includes employment opportunities during road \nconstruction. Although this impact is short-term, the design of local maintenance contracts under the \nproject will act to promote longer-term wage and employment impacts.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?     Yes     No  \nA stakeholder analysis employing focus group discussions and supported by a socioeconomic survey of \nthe project area will be undertaken to determine or establish (i) who are the primary and secondary \nbeneficiaries of the project; (ii) baseline information on the poverty situation in project impact areas and \ninfluence areas; (iii) what are the perceived and anticipated negative and positive impacts of the project; \n(iv) suggestions on how to maximize project benefits; (v) suggestions on how to avoid and mitigate any \nnegative impacts; and (vi) ways in which the local population, especially those adversely impacted, may \nparticipate in planning and implementing the project, including the resettlement plan (RP). \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes        No \nStakeholders will be consulted and their opinions solicited at various stages of the project cycle and in a \nway that will help engender ownership of the project among the local population. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nMigration and Trafficking \n \nDue to its proximity to Thailand, the area is prone to labor mobility, both inward and outward. Most of the \nmigrants are very poor with inadequate landholdings. Short-term migration takes place in response to \nunderemployment during off-peak agricultural seasons. The majority of the migrants are women who work \njust across the border. Long-term migrants, the majority of whom are men, belong to households with \nsufficient assets to finance their trips. However, migration might end up in exploitative circumstances in the \nhands of traffickers. \n \nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus and Sexually Transmitted Infection (HIV/STI)  \n \nAll three provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Oddar Meanchey, and Siem Reap rank low in terms of women\u2019s \nknowledge of HIV/STI prevention. SIV surveillance testing in 2000 in Banteay Meanchey found HIV-\npositive people in the groups tested: 7.3% of the police, 37.3% of direct commercial sex workers, 13.3% of \nindirect sex workers, and 4% of pregnant women attending antenatal clinics. Given the rather high \nincidence of HIV/AIDS (acquired Immunodeficiency syndrome) in Banteay Meanchey and low awareness \ntogether with an expected increase of truck drivers going through the area, there is the risk that HIV/AIDS \nmay further spread to and from the project area. To reduce this risk, a participatory approach to raising \nHIV/AIDS awareness will be followed. This will be based on best practices developed under TA 5881-\nREG: Preventing HIV/AIDS Among Mobile Population in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n \nIn conjunction with stakeholder analysis, gender assessment in the project impact area and influence area \nwill be undertaken to identify potential gender issues for consideration in the RP. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

The outputs from the consulting services will be used to prepare \nthe  Project  to  be  funded  by  ADB.  Therefore,  all  economic  and  social  analyses,  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE), a resettlement plan (RP), and an ethnic minorities development \nplan (EMDP), if required, must meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines as well as \nthe requirements of the Government of Cambodia. Technical designs for the project roads and \ncross-border facilities will be prepared in accordance with Cambodian highway standards and/or \ninternationally recognized highway standards, the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Agreement \non  Facilitation  of  Cross-Border  Transport  of  Goods  and  People  (the  GMS  Cross-Border \nAgreement), and the laws and regulations of Cambodia. \n \nB.  Scope of Works and Terms of Reference  \n \n2.  The Project will cover (i) rehabilitating National Road (NR) 33 from Kampong Trach to Lork \n(17 kilometers [km]) and upgrading the border post,1 (ii) rehabilitating NR56 from Sisophon to \nSamraong (114 km), (iii) rehabilitating NR68 from Kralanh to O\u2019smach (79 km) and upgrading the \nborder post, (iv) improving NR72 from Kreak to Trapeang Phlong Pir (14 km) and upgrading the \nborder post, and (v) road maintenance works and road safety improvements. The consultants will \nreview the loan documents of the GMS: Cambodia Road Improvement project (Loan 1945-CAM) \nand the final reports of TAs preparing this project, and undertake engineering, economic, financial, \nsocial, and environmental studies, which may be modified in discussions with the ADB project team \nduring further processing. \n \n1.  Project Preparation Study  \n \n3.  The consultants\u2019 tasks will include, but will not be limited to, the following engineering \nstudies:  \n \n(i)  Carry  out  all  necessary  topographical,  hydraulic,  hydrological,  and  geotechnical \ninvestigations including centerlines and flood surveys, to provide a reasonable basis for the \ndetailed design and cost estimates. Prepare horizontal and vertical realignments of existing \nproject roads including planning of new alignments, if needed.  \n(ii)  Survey the extent to which unexploded ordnance (UXO) may be present within the right-of-\nway  of  the  project  roads.  Develop  an  approach  to  clearing  it  if  the  survey  indicates \ncontaminated areas. Include UXO clearance in the TA if it is required to complete surveys \nand ground investigation work for the feasibility studies. \n(iii)  Identify  roadside  infrastructure  (cables,  pipelines,  etc.)  where  permanent  or  temporary \nrelocation is required, and prepare detailed plans for relocation in cooperation with the \nconcerned infrastructure owners. \n                                                 \n1 While NR33 is an integral part of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Southern Coastal Corridor, only the 17-km \nsection has not yet been improved.
