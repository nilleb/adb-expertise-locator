A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is required to prepare the Samarkand \nSolar Power Project, and assist in pre-implementation works.   \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The PPTA is necessary on the following grounds:  \n \n(i)  The project is the first of its kind in Uzbekistan and in Central Asia, and is \nurgently needed and needs to be prepared in a short period of time.  \n(ii)  The government is keen to invest in the project but the executing agency, SJSC \nUzbekenergo,  has  no  experience  and  no  capacity  in  designing  and  in \nimplementing  this  pioneering  large  scale  grid-connected  solar  photovoltaic \nproject. A policy and advisory technical assistance (PATA) is conducting onsite \nmeasurements and safeguards due diligence, and preparing the feasibility study, \nfurther technical assistance is needed for technical and financial due diligence to \nprocess a loan for the project, prepare conceptual engineering design and tender \ndocuments, and to provide assistance to procurement;  \n(iii)  There  is  a  need  for  expertise from  international  and  national  consultants  to \nundertake  the  pre-implementation  works,  and  build  the  executing  agency\u2019s \ncapacity, considering the project\u2019s demonstration and replication potential.   \n \nB.
