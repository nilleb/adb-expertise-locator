The proposed technical assistance (TA) project for Provincial Development Strategies \nfor  Two  Northeastern Provinces  follows  the  four  advisory  projects of  a  similar  nature  and \npurpose that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has undertaken in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC). This series of TAs has helped the Government of the PRC develop a systematic \napproach to reforms at the provincial level. The previous TA projects were approved for four \nprovinces and two autonomous regions in the central and western regions\u2014namely, Gansu, \nHebei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, and the Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous \nregions.1 The completed TA projects (Hebei and Inner Mongolia) were rated as successful and \ntheir outputs were used in formulating the provincial strategies.2 The Government asked the \nADB during the 2007 country program midterm review mission to provide two northeastern \nprovinces with similar assistance. A fact-finding mission held discussions in February 2008 with \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces on the objectives and scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and cost of the TA project. This report reflects the mission\u2019s \nfindings and the understandings reached with the Government on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3\nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The northeastern region of the PRC consists of three provinces: Heilongjiang, Jilin, and \nLiaoning. Like the central and western regions, the Northeast lags behind the eastern region in \nsocial and economic development. Historically, it has been developed mainly through state-\nowned enterprises with an orientation toward old industrial bases\u2014i.e., mining, energy, and \nequipment  manufacturing  industries.  Its  industrial  and  agricultural  technologies  are  now \noutdated. As a result, the region faces key challenges, including (i) heavy reliance on natural \nresources; (ii) a weak private sector; (iii) insufficient financial channels for small and medium \nenterprises; (iv) outdated agricultural technologies; (v) poor rural infrastructure, especially for \nirrigation; (vi) insufficient rural finances; (vii) poor service and information systems; (viii) weak \nhigh-end agricultural processing capacity; and (ix) underdeveloped markets and fragmented \nlogistics systems.  \n3.  As part of its overall effort to narrow regional disparities, the Government called in \nNovember 2002 for a revitalization strategy for the northeastern old industrial base. This broad \nstrategy aims to promote industrial restructuring and agricultural modernization in the region. \nThe  Government  has  since  issued  a  series  of  policies  and  plans  to  rejuvenate  the three \nnortheastern provinces.4 Because the Northeast is one of the country\u2019s key agricultural bases, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 August 2008.  \n4  The revitalization strategy for the northeastern old industrial base is a broad government policy for promoting \nindustrial restructuring and agricultural modernization in the Northeast. This policy is reflected in a series of \ngovernment documents and plans issued since 2002, including Government of the PRC 2003. Opinions for \nImplementing Revitalization Strategy for the Northeastern Old Industrial Base. Beijing; Government of the PRC. ", "2\nthe Government has also issued five documents since 2004 focusing on rural development.5\nThe policies urge the northeastern provinces to (i) explore new industries to replace natural \nresource-oriented industries; (ii) accelerate state-owned enterprise reform; (iii) strengthen the \nprivate  sector;  (iv)  upgrade  agricultural  and  industrial  technologies;  (v)  promote  modern \nagriculture by increasing value-added agricultural products and strengthening the grain base \nthrough large-scale, standardized, mechanized, and industrialized agriculture, and; (vi) enhance \nrural infrastructure and logistics; and (vii) improve rural and urban financial systems.  \n4.  The TA builds on previous ADB support to improve provincial policies and development \nstrategies to ensure the effectiveness of the Government\u2019s planning and development efforts for \nthe two selected provinces: Heilongjiang and Jilin.6 Previous ADB support suggested that the \nsuccess of this kind of advisory TA depends on (i) support and involvement of high-level officials, \n(ii) sufficient consultations with stakeholders, and (iii) strong ownership from the executing \nagencies.  The  TA  outputs  will  help  both  provinces  to  (i)  explore  new  concepts  and  new \nindustries to replace those relying on natural resources, (ii) improve rural finance and small- and \nmedium-enterprise  financing,  (iii)  strengthen  public\u2013private  partnerships,  (iv)  enhance  pro-\nagriculture policies, and (v) prepare a long-term financing plan for internal and external financial \nresources.\nA.  Heilongjiang Development Strategy\n5.  Heilongjiang had a population of 39.24 million people in 2007. Fourteen of 68 counties in \nthe province are classified as national poverty counties.7 In 2006, 1.93 million people, or 5.1% of \nthe total population, had incomes below the government's official poverty line. About 54% of the \ncounties rely on coal, oil, and forestry. Agriculture plays a key role in Heilongjiang. In 2007, the \nprovince accounted for 7.9% of national grain output, much higher than its 2.9% share of the \ncountry\u2019s population. Strengthening rural finance is essential to enhance agricultural production \nand processing. New industries are needed to replace the natural resource-oriented industries, \nand to create job opportunities. Public\u2013private partnerships in financing urban infrastructure \nneed  to  be  strengthened.  In  addition,  sufficient  small-  and  medium-enterprise  financing  is \nneeded to promote private sector development. \n6.  To boost inclusive economic development, the Heilongjiang provincial government has \nissued a series of documents and policies, including the Heilongjiang 11th Five-Year Plan, to \nencourage sustainable development for counties that rely on natural resources, as well as \npromote private sector development, rural finance reform, and rural credit union reform. The TA \nwill support studies in four areas: (i) rural finance and its critical role in rural development, (ii) \nsmall and medium enterprises as the outlets for agricultural products and a means for absorbing \n                                                                                                                               \n2004. Work Priorities for Rejuvenation Strategy for the Northeastern Old Industrial Base and Other Old Industrial \nBases. Beijing; and Government of the PRC. 2007. Suggestions for Advancing Sustainable Development of \nNatural Resource-Oriented Cities. Beijing. \n5  Since  2004,  the  Government\u2019s  \u201cNumber  One\u201d  documents\u2014the  first  documents  approved  by  the  central \nGovernment every year\u2014have focused on rural issues. The titles of the Number One documents are \u201cSuggestions \nfor Facilitating Income Increase for Farmers\u201d in 2004; \u201cPolicies for Further Strengthening Rural Development and \nImproving Agricultural Production Capacity\u201d in 2005; \u201cOpinions for Promotion of the New Countryside Building\u201d in \n2006; \u201cSuggestions for Agricultural Modernization and New Countryside Building\u201d in 2007; and \u201cSuggestions for \nEnhancement of Agricultural Development and Further Push on Income Increase for the Farmers\u201d in 2008. \n6  In addition to the TAs cited in Footnote 1, ADB has helped the two provinces in projects related to water supply and \nsewerage development, road network development, and other areas. \n7  The Government targets its poverty-reduction programs at counties with relatively high numbers of rural poor. A \nnational poverty county is a target for central government poverty-reduction programs. Provincial governments \ndesignate provincial poverty counties.", "3\nsurplus rural labor, (iii) improved environments in industrial municipalities that rely heavily on \nnatural  resources,  and  (iv)  private\u2013public  partnerships  as  an  important  source  of  financial \nsupport for urban infrastructure development.  \nB.  Jilin Development Strategy \n7.  Jilin is an agriculture-oriented province with 26.8 million people, 54.9% of whom live in \nrural areas. Eight out of its 50 counties are national poverty counties. In 2006, 240,000 people, \nor 1.88% of Jilin's rural people, lived on incomes below the official poverty line. The agriculture \nsector generated 15.7% of the provincial GDP in 2006. A majority of Jilin\u2019s rural population \ndepend  on  the  agriculture  sector  and  agriculture-related  industries  for  their  livelihood. \nFortunately, Jilin is endowed with rich soil and has produced an excess of food products for \nconsumption outside the province. In 2007, Jilin accounted for 7.1% of the total commodity grain \nproduction in the PRC although it is home to only 2.1% of the country\u2019s population. Jilin\u2019s \ncommodity grain production per capita was 608 kilograms in 2007, more than three times the \nnational average of 176 kilograms.  \n8.  In preparing the 11th Five-Year Plan for Jilin province, researchers and provincial officials \nconducted comprehensive, in-depth research. Based on their findings and conclusions, as well \nas the importance of agriculture in the province, the Government requested a study focusing on \nthe agriculture sector to help put the plan\u2019s general strategy on agriculture into operation. The \nJilin  government\u2019s  efforts  to  enhance  productivity  in  this  sector  and  in  agriculture-related \nindustries  will  support  the  national  government  goal  to  contain  inflation.  The  numerous \nchallenges Jilin faces in improving productivity include (i) outdated agricultural technologies; (ii) \ninsufficient rural financial and fiscal resources and poor agricultural service systems, including \ninadequate  and  inefficient  insurance  and  investment  systems;  (iii)  a  low  concentration  of \nagricultural production, which makes the farmers vulnerable to natural and market risks; (iv) \ninsufficient high-end agricultural processing capacity; (v) poor rural infrastructure, marketing, \nand logistics; and (vi) inappropriate agricultural subsidies and a lack of effective fiscal incentives \nto promote agricultural productivity.  \n9.  To address these challenges, the Jilin provincial government has issued a series of \npolicy documents that call for developing agro-processing industries, accelerating agriculture-\nrelated  industries,  strengthening  rural  cooperatives,  promoting  large-scale  agricultural \nproduction, setting up agricultural technology dissemination systems, facilitating rural insurance, \nand strengthening rural infrastructure.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be increased economic productivity in Heilongjiang and Jilin \nprovinces through the revitalization of the old industrial base with advanced industrial and \nagricultural  technologies,  improved  financial  systems,  and  enhanced  public\u2013private \npartnerships. The outcome of the TA will be improved provincial policies, documents, and plans \non modern agriculture development, industrial restructuring, rural and urban financial systems, \nand public\u2013private partnerships.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will help develop two major outputs: (i) Heilongjiang provincial development \nstrategy (part 1), and (ii) Jilin provincial development strategy (part 2). The two development \nstrategies will provide recommendations to the respective provincial governments on how to ", "4\nimprove  strategic  policy-making  capacity  and  achieve  inclusive  and  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment. \n12. Part  1:  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Development  Strategy.  Part  1  will  formulate  a \nstrategy for the Heilongjiang provincial government that uses the province\u2019s natural advantages \nand complements the strategic framework for revitalizing the Northeast\u2019s old industrial base. \nThis strategy will help the Heilongjiang provincial government achieve inclusive and sustainable \ndevelopment. \n13. Output. The Heilongjiang provincial development strategy will include one main report \non the revitalization of the old industrial base, supported by five subreports on (i) rural finance, \nwith a focus on rural credit unions; (ii) new industries to supplement or replace coal and forestry \nindustries  in  six  prefecture-level  cities;  (iii)  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  urban  sewage \ntreatment and water supply; (iv) small- and medium-enterprise financing and development; and \n(v) relevant international experience and cases. \n14.  Part 1 will include the following key activities: (i) a literature review; (ii) site visits and \nmeetings with government agencies, academic institutions, and civil society organizations; (iii) \nanalysis of problems and proposals for solutions to achieve sustainable social and economic \ndevelopment; (iv) review on and recommendation of best international practices relevant to local \nsituations; (v) an inception workshop, a midterm report review workshop, and a final draft report \nreview workshop; (vi) organization of overseas study visits to help government officials learn \ninnovative technologies that are new to the PRC; (vii) sharing of TA findings with provincial \ngovernment  agencies,  international  development  partners,  academic  institutions,  and  civil \nsociety  organizations  in  the  Northeast  and  other  regions  through  a  press  conference  and \nseminars; and (viii) publication of the final report and its posting on the ADB website. \n15. Part 2: Jilin Provincial Development Strategy. Part 2 of the project will formulate a \ndevelopment strategy for the Jilin provincial government to achieve inclusive and sustainable \nagricultural development to supplement the Government\u2019s comprehensive strategy.  \n16. Output.  The  Jilin  provincial  development  strategy  will  produce  one  main  report  on \nagricultural modernization, supported by eight subreports on (i) optimization of key agricultural \ntechnologies; (ii) rural infrastructure; (iii) rural finance and fiscal incentives; (iv) rural market and \nlogistics;  (v)  institutional  innovation  for  agricultural  production  and  management;  (vi)  rural \nservice system, including technology dissemination; (vii) rural vocational training related to \nmodern agricultural development; and (viii) sustainable agricultural development. \n17.  Part 2 will include the following key activities: (i) a literature review; (ii) site visits and \nmeetings with government agencies, academic institutions, and civil society organizations; (iii) \nanalysis of problems and proposals of solutions to achieve socioeconomic development; (iv) \nanalysis of problems and proposals of solutions on modern agriculture, rural finance, rural \nvocational training, and fiscal and tax systems for agricultural development; (v) review of and \nrecommendations on best international practices relevant to local situations; (vi) an inception \nworkshop, a midterm report review workshop, and a final draft report review workshop, bringing \ntogether  government  officials,  academic  institutions,  civil  society  organizations,  and  other \ndevelopment  partners  to  discuss  key  issues  and  evaluate  the  consultants'  findings  and \nrecommendations; (vii) organization of overseas study visits to help government officials learn \ninnovative technologies that are new to the PRC; (viii) sharing of TA findings with provincial \ngovernment agencies, international development partners, academic institutions, civil society \norganizations in the Northeast and other regions through a press conference and seminars; and \n(ix) publication of the final report in print form and on the ADB website. ", "5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The estimated cost of the TA is the equivalent of $1,110,000, of which $800,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA funds provided by ADB will be \ndivided evenly between the two provinces in allocations of $400,000 each. Contributions by the \nHeilongjiang and Jilin provincial governments, estimated at the equivalent of $310,000, will \ncover  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space  and  meeting  venues,  furniture, \nadministrative support, and logistics. Appendix 2 details cost estimates and the financing plan.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The executing agencies for parts 1 and 2 will be the Heilongjiang Provincial Department \nof Finance (HPDF) and the Jilin Provincial Department of Finance (JPDF), respectively. In each \nprovince, a project steering committee will guide the TA activities. The committees will be led by \na vice governor and will consist of senior officials from provincial government agencies and \nexperts from relevant academic institutions.  \n20.  HPDF and JPDF will coordinate with provincial agencies to carry out, monitor, and \nevaluate the results. They will provide office space with telecommunication access, counterpart \nstaff, and material, information, data, and logistical support needed by the consultants. Before \nthe TA starts, HPDF and JPDF will each appoint a provincial project coordinator who will \nundertake preparatory actions and liaise and coordinate with ADB and the consultants. \n21.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 18 months.8 A consulting firm will be \nselected for each part using quality- and cost-based selection and applying the 80:20 quality-to-\ncost ratio in the selection of the consultants.9 A simplified technical proposal will be required. \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Part 1 will need 2 person-months of \ninternational and 30 person-months of national consulting inputs. Part 2 will need 2 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  32  person-months  of  national  consulting  inputs.  Two  national \nconsultants will be appointed as team leaders for parts 1 and 2, and they will be responsible for \npreparing the main reports and supervising the national and international consultants. The \nconsultants  will  carry  out  the  tasks  in  a  consultative  manner,  encouraging  stakeholder \nparticipation. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3. Disbursement will follow \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time). \nADB will establish an advanced payment facility with each executing agency to help in the \nimplementation  of  the  TA.  The  detailed  procedures  of  each  of  these  facilities  will  be  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. All procurement will \nfollow ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The procured \nequipment will be handed over to the executing agencies when the TA project is completed.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Provincial Development Strategies for \nTwo Northeastern Provinces, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n8  The TA project is expected to start in January 2009 and to be completed in June 2010. \n9  Quality- and cost-based selection is a method of selecting a consulting firm based on both the quality of the \ntechnical proposals and the costs in the financial proposals. The technical proposals will be given a weight of 80% \nand the costs a weight of 20%.
