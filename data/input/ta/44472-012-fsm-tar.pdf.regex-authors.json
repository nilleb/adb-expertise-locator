INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 2012, the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) approved the \nNational  Energy  Policy  (NEP)  after  4  years  of  development  supported  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the European Union (EU). The goal of the NEP is to \u201cimprove the \nlife  and  livelihood  of  all  FSM  citizens  with  affordable,  reliable  and  environmentally  sound \nenergy.\u201d1 The NEP aims to reduce dependence on imported fuel by increasing generation from \nrenewable energy sources and reducing consumption through more efficient energy use. The \npolicy set a target of producing 30% of electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020. \n \n2.  Following approval of the  NEP, the government asked for ADB support to develop \nrenewable energy generation and increase distribution efficiency in Pohnpei State and Yap \nState.  ADB  responded  to  the  government\u2019s  request  by  supporting  the  preparation  of  two \nproposed projects. In Yap State, ADB\u2019s proposed assistance is expected to replace diesel \ngeneration with solar and wind generation. In Pohnpei State, ADB\u2019s proposed assistance is \nexpected to increase the efficiency of diesel generation and the distribution network.  \n \n3.  The technical assistance (TA) is intended to strengthen the energy sector regulatory \nframework to create a better enabling environment for long-term investments in renewable \nenergy.2 The TA was developed in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including \nnational- and state-level representatives. The government concurs with the impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost financing arrangements, and terms of reference. \nState-level representatives are informed of the proposed TA and welcome state-specific support. \nThe design and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Background \n4.  The FSM has a population of 102,800 living on 533 islands that are administered by the \nfour autonomous states of Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap. During 2006\u20132008, the FSM \nexperienced  negative  growth  that  reached  \u20132.3%  in  2008.  Starting  from  2009,  the  FSM \neconomy showed signs of recovery with real growth of 0.4% in 2009 and 3.1% in 2010.3  \n \n5.    The economy is particularly vulnerable to fuel price volatility. Oil imports averaged 10.7% \nof  gross  domestic  product  during  2005\u20132009.  In  2008,  when  international  crude  oil  price \nreached nearly $150 per barrel, oil imports peaked at 14% of gross domestic product, and \nshrank by almost half in the following year. High fuel prices also have a large impact on the \nenergy  sector  as they  translate  into  high  electricity  prices for  end  users. This  is  because \nelectricity generation for the main grids in the four states is almost completely based on fossil \nfuel. \n \n6.  Generation, transmission,  and  distribution  are the  responsibility  of four  corporatized \nutilities, one for each state. Each state owns the utility and exercises ownership rights through \none or more representatives on the utility\u2019s board. Each utility has developed its own tariff \nscheme, but they follow a similar procedure to revise tariffs. The board has the power to \n                                                \n1 Federated States of Micronesia. 2010. National Energy Policy. Volume 1.  \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 November 2012. \n3 International Monetary Fund estimates. \n   ", "2 \n \n \napprove and adjust tariffs as proposed by the utility\u2019s management upon the presentation of a \ntariff increase proposal. Currently, tariffs cover operating and basic maintenance costs, but at \ndifferent levels in each state, and include a fuel price pass-through. None of the utilities is able \nto  generate  enough  revenue  to  support  large-scale  infrastructure  rehabilitation  or  new \ninvestments in renewable energy.  \n \nB.  Key Development Challenges  \n7.  Financing renewable energy investments. Given the high dependence on fossil fuel, \nthe NEP identifies renewable energy as the most desirable option for improving energy services. \nAlthough the NEP set a target of 30% of generation through renewables by 2020, none of the \nutilities  has  developed  an  asset  management  and  financing  plan  for  the  development  of \nrenewable generation. The four utilities are currently expanding renewable generation capacity \nsolely through external assistance. The EU and the Government of Japan are installing grid-\nconnected solar photovoltaic panels in Chuuk State and stand-alone systems in the Yap outer \nislands. The EU is also supporting the rehabilitation of the Nanpil hydropower plant in Pohnpei \nState.  The  Government  of  Japan  is  assisting  Pohnpei  State  with  the  installation  of  grid-\nconnected solar panels on the top of two government buildings. ADB is preparing a proposed \nloan to Yap State to convert part of the diesel-based generation into solar and wind generation. \nThese initiatives will contribute an overall average of 15% generation (for the four states) from \nrenewable energy.4  \n \n8.  Integrating  and  regulating  renewable  energy.  Grid-connected  solar  systems  are \ndesigned to feed the existing transmission and distribution network. However, contracts need to \nbe  developed  to  regulate  the  relationship  between  utilities  and  suppliers.  Pohnpei  State \npromulgated a law that regulates net metering in August 2012. The law was not developed in \nconjunction with the utility, and therefore the ability of the utility to cope with the tariffs and \ncharges implied by the law is unclear. Yap State is in the process of drafting net metering \nregulations and has expressed interest in accessing ADB support for this purpose. \n \n9.  Bridging  the  financing  gap  through  private  sector  participation.  Resources  to \ndevelop renewable energy investment could be funded through tariffs, public debt, or private \ninvestment. Although tariffs are relatively high in all states compared to international standards, \nthey are generally not able to generate sufficient cash flow to cover large investments because \nof high fuel costs. Therefore, Pohnpei State is in the process of procuring 4 megawatt diesel \ngeneration and 7 megawatt renewable energy generation through private sector participation. \nPohnpei State\u2019s utility, the Public Utility Corporation issued a request for proposals in June 2012. \nOperation and maintenance are also a challenge, and Yap\u2019s utility, the Yap State Public Service \nCorporation, is considering outsourcing the operation and maintenance of the systems to private \noperators. \n \n10.  The NEP recognizes private sector participation as one of the major drivers for the long- \nterm development of renewable energy investment. The current challenge that the four states \nare facing  is  how  to  attract  private  sector  investment to  develop  renewable  generation  at \nreasonable cost. A transparent and enforceable regulatory framework for the energy sector will \ncontribute to creating an enabling environment to attract private sector investment.  \n \n                                                \n4  ADB\u2019s project preparatory TA for the proposed Yap Renewable Energy Development Project estimates that 25% of \nthe power generation of Yap State will be sourced from renewable energy once the project is completed.  \n ", "3 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be an improved enabling environment for renewable energy investments \nin the FSM. The outcome will be improved management of renewable energy investments. \nImproved enabling environment consists of improved state laws and regulations and contractual \narrangements between utilities and power suppliers that promote and facilitate private sector \ninvestment in renewable energy.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  outputs  of  the  TA  are  the  (i)  development  of  options  to  improve  the  existing \nregulatory framework (ii) development of options to increase investments in renewable energy \nunder new regulatory models, and (iii) design of model contracts for power purchase from \nindependent generators. \n \n13.  Output 1: Development of options to improve the regulatory framework. Output 1 \nwill  recommend  a  regulatory  framework  for  the  power  sector  in  at  least  two  states.  The \nframework will build on the targets and aspirations set out in the NEP. The assessment of \noptions will include existing barriers to private sector participation in power generation, and in \ndistribution if appropriate. The recommendations will indicate a road map or action plan for at \nleast one state to implement the proposed regulatory changes. When needed, assistance will be \nprovided to draft laws and regulations. The regulatory aspects that will be considered include (i) \nadequacy of existing laws and regulations to encourage private sector participation in the power \nsector, (ii) net metering and other mechanisms to encourage small-scale on-grid generation, \nand (iii) steps to remove barriers imposed by the existing tariff-setting mechanisms to stimulate \nprivate investment in the power sector.  \n \n14.  Output 1 will assess regulatory aspects that could improve private sector participation. \nWhen designing options for private sector participation, the study will consider \n(i)  licensing for generation, network, and supply businesses, whether separate for \neach  business,  or  single  licenses  that  separately  define  and  address  each \nbusiness, or separate provisions for each business in a concession contract; \n(ii)  separate audited accounts for generation, network, and supply businesses; \n(iii)  transparent internal contracts for power purchase agreements as the basis on \nwhich the existing supply business will purchase electricity from each of the \ngenerating plants of the generation business; and  \n(iv)  generation licenses for independent power producers. \n \n15.  Output 2: Development of options for increasing investment in renewable energy. \nOutput  2  will  help  the  utilities,  under  the  coordination  and  direction  of  the  Department  of \nResources and Development, to (i) revise and update investment priorities starting from the \ninvestments identified in the NEP, (ii) present investment modalities and options, (iii) identify \nresources to pay for investments, and (iv) advise on potential investment proposals. Resources \nto bridge the investment gap might be grants, debt, the utilities\u2019 cash flow generated from tariffs, \nor private capital investment.  \n \n16.  As part of output 2, support will be provided to utilities to assess the adequacy of tariffs \nto cover the investment plan in the long run under the four funding options listed. Output 2 will \nalso  assess  the  adequacy  of  existing  tariff  setting  methodologies  to  attract  private  sector \n ", "4 \n \n \ninvestment, and assist the utilities to develop strengthened tariff methodologies as needed. To \nincrease investment in renewable energy, under the assumption that grant financing will not \nalways be available, utilities, regulators, and policy makers should develop an understanding on \nhow to incorporate tariff components that could cover the investment costs. Output 2 will include \ntraining on tariff-setting methodologies that would cater to the specific needs of the utilities in the \nFSM.  \n \n17.  Output 3: Design of model contracts for independent generation. Output 3 will \nprovide assistance to utilities to design model contracts to be employed to purchase power \ngeneration.  The  model  contracts  should  take  into  account  the  generation  technology \n(conventional  generation  and  renewable  resources)  and  power  producers  (utility  scale  or \nhousehold). Model contracts will be developed for institutional suppliers as well as small-scale \ncommercial and household suppliers. A model contract for small-scale, on-grid supply will be \nprepared in the states that have implemented or are drafting regulations that account for net \nmetering. Case studies on how other small utilities are regulating net metering will be developed \nand disseminated among the utilities and other stakeholders. Output 3 is expected to provide \nassistance to one or more utilities to design and enter a contract for power supply.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The preliminary cost \nestimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed \nin accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n19.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff,  domestic \ntransportation, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 19 months from 1 February 2013 to 31 August 2014. \nImplementation  arrangements  reflect  the  roles  and  strengths  of  the  national  and  state \nstakeholders. Because of its role as the national policy-making body for the energy sector, the \nDepartment of Resources and Development will act as  executing agency. The Division of \nEnergy under the Department of Resources and Development will supervise the consultants \nhired through the TA and provide counterpart office space during the consultants\u2019 visits to the \ncountry. \n \n21.  ADB  will  recruit  consulting  firm(s)  to  provide  15  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 10 person-months of national consulting services. The consultants will \nhave regulatory, legal, financial, and engineering expertise. The outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged through the quality- and \ncost-based selection method (90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio) in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  Outputs will be monitored throughout the TA duration through review missions and \nquarterly reports and regular communications submitted by the consulting team. The outcome \nwill be evaluated upon TA closure and disseminated through a stakeholders\u2019 workshop to be \nheld in the FSM. \n ", "5 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.
