INTRODUCTION \n1.  Since 2000, world concern about the impacts of climate change, increasing scarcity of \nwater, and, most recently, sharply higher and more volatile international food prices have grown \nrapidly. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will play catalytic roles in assisting Asia to both \nsustain food security and adapt to an environment of increasing scarcity and variability of fresh \nwater  supply.  This  will  require  a  continuous  stream  of  new  knowledge  and  innovative \noperational  approaches  to  sustainable  water  and  land  management.  This  research  and \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) will support the identification, assessment, and design of \nnew  investments  for  more  sustainable,  water-efficient  irrigated  agriculture.  The  TA  was \nprepared in consultation with ADB\u2019s South Asia Department, including the resident missions. \nThe TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,1 which supports sustainable management of \nnatural  resources  and  investments  in  water  systems  and  other  essential  public  services, \nparticularly those that benefit the poor. The TA responds directly to ADB\u2019s operational plan for \nsustainable  food  security  and  ADB\u2019s  water  operational  plan  for  2011\u20132020,  which  call  for \nimproving the productivity and efficiency of water use through (i) investing in modern irrigation \ninfrastructure, (ii) adopting enabling policies that correctly price the opportunity cost of water, \nand (iii) strengthening institutions for more efficient and sustainable water management.2 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  By 2050, the world population may reach 9 billion. According to the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations, up to 70% more food will be needed to match population \ngrowth and the impacts of consumer income growth and urbanization on food demand. This will \nplace tremendous pressure on increasingly scarce land and water resources. Much of Asia, \nparticularly South Asia and Central Asia, is highly vulnerable to climate change. Presently, \nabout 80% of Asia\u2019s fresh water is used for agriculture, but this is unlikely to be sustainable \ngiven the competing water demands of nonagricultural users and the environment and the \nincreasing  variability  of  rainfall  due  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change.  By  2030,  40%  of \ndeveloping Asia is projected to face a severe water shortage. Hence, there is a compelling need \nto identify and field test innovations that both conserve water and raise agricultural productivity.  \n \n3.  In  irrigated  agriculture,  water  use  efficiency  usually  refers  to  the  amount  of  water \neffectively taken up by the crop as a percentage of the total water diverted into the irrigation \nsystem. Large losses of water are inevitable in conveyance and distribution, particularly in open \nunlined canals, as well as in field application. The overall efficiency of surface irrigation is low, \nalthough some of the percolation loss can be restored for crop and downstream uses via \ngroundwater recharge and pumping. According to ADB\u2019s water operational plan for 2011\u20132020, \nin most of Asia irrigation efficiency averages only 37%. This compares to levels of 45%\u201350% \nachieved in the more highly developed, water-scarce countries of the Mediterranean region.4 \nGiven the huge share of total water use for irrigation, a modest improvement in overall irrigation \nefficiency could potentially have a significant impact on water availability within a river basin. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

The areas actually irrigated in many systems are often much smaller than the command \nareas covered, reflecting poor system management and inadequate operation and maintenance, \nwhich lead to inequitable distribution of the available water among farmers near to and far from \nthe  water  source.  Poor  timing  of  water  delivery  is  a  further  source  of  inefficiency.  Crop \nproductivity suffers if water delivery does not match crop demands in both quantity and time. \nFurthermore, Asia\u2019s irrigation water is rarely priced, rationed, or even measured by quantity, \nthus giving farmers little incentive to economize on using the water they actually receive. The \ndifficulty of imposing water charges in surface irrigation will be a major challenge in efforts to \nraise water use efficiency, but some form of valuation may be essential if farmers are to adopt \nwater-conserving crop practices. \n \n5.  Since 1980, groundwater has emerged as a major component of irrigation in many \ncountries, including in many large-scale canal irrigation schemes. Any attempt to improve water \nuse efficiency and productivity cannot focus solely on canal irrigation, but requires a broader \nperspective on conjunctive use and management of surface and groundwater. \n \n6.  Since most of Asia\u2019s farmers are poor and operate small farms, suitable incentives are \nneeded to assure farmers that water conservation will protect and, ideally, enhance rather than \njeopardize their incomes. Equally important, based on the lessons of past international efforts in \nwater conservation, widespread adoption of water-saving technologies will require a suitable \ninstitutional and policy environment, together with appropriate market-based incentives for all \nwater  users  and  the  private  sector.  The  TA  will  seek  to  identify  viable,  location-specific \ntechnologies, management practices, policies, and institutional arrangements that are ready for \npilot testing, replication, and scaling up in future ADB lending operations in South Asia.  \n \n7.  Ideal study areas under the TA would have water systems where there is a significant \ndegree of water scarcity, increasing competition for water between agriculture and other sectors, \nand strong local awareness of the need for action. Ideally, there would also be scope for water \ntransfers between sectors and the potential for some form of water pricing or rationing to give all \nwater  users  an  incentive  to  conserve  water.  Finally,  the  concerned  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs) should have a significant program of proposed and ongoing ADB water \noperations  in  which  innovative  water-conserving  technologies,  policies,  and  institutional \napproaches can be pilot tested and, if successful, mainstreamed in future operations of ADB \nand other development partners.  \n \n8.  Bangladesh, India, and Nepal have been chosen to participate in the TA because they \npossess these characteristics, are highly vulnerable to climate change, contain a high share of \nAsia\u2019s rural poor, and share similar agroecological zones and farming systems. Further, the \ngovernments of the three countries prioritize water resource management in their respective \ncountry strategies. The India country partnership strategy, 2009\u201320125 gives an important role \nto agriculture growth, climate change adaptation, rural development, and water resources in line \nwith the country\u2019s Eleventh Five-Year Plan. ADB will assist in developing irrigation infrastructure \nto increase agricultural productivity, better water resources management between sectors and \nwithin each sector, and the resilience of agriculture to climate change. In Bangladesh, under the \ncountry strategy and program, 2006\u20132010,6 ADB supports efficient and sustainable irrigation to \nboost  agricultural  productivity  and  livelihood  diversification,  building  on  the  National  Water \nPolicy and the National Water Management Plan. In Nepal, the country partnership strategy, \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n6  ADB. 2005.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be a more water-efficient and reliable (climate-change resistant) food \nsupply in participating DMCs by 2020. Performance targets include (i) improved water efficiency \nin  target  irrigation  systems  with  crop  yield  increases  of  at  least  10%  compared  to  2012 \nbaselines in irrigation systems covering at least 100,000 hectares and in 50,000 poor farm \nhouseholds, and (ii) financing for more water-efficient irrigation of $500 million annually in South \nAsia  by  2017.  The  outcome  will  be  technically,  economically,  and  environmentally  sound \ntechnologies and associated institutional and policy frameworks ready for scaling up in future \noperations by ADB and other development partners. Specific deliverables are that future ADB \noperations will reflect the TA\u2019s recommendations in the design of new ADB projects in the \nparticipating DMCs by 2017. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will involve two interrelated components: task 1 is a comprehensive synthesis of \nstate-of-the-art knowledge and international best practices in water-efficient irrigated agriculture, \nincluding  preparation  of  a  detailed  analytical  framework  for  raising  water  use  efficiency  in \nirrigated agriculture in the different agroecosystems and irrigation domains of Asia.  \n \n11.  Task 2 will involve country studies and capacity building to support the application of \ninnovative  water-efficient  technologies  and  management  systems  in  the  design  and \nimplementation of ADB investment projects in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. In Bangladesh, \nADB will support the proposed 2013 project for Piloting Improvement Management of Muhuri \nIrrigation, which will be the anchor for the TA activities. In India, the TA will focus on 2\u20133 major \nirrigation systems in water-stressed river basins assisted by ADB at the state level, and may \nalso support states where ADB is assisting  with putting into operation the National Water \nMission of the National Action Plan on Climate Change. In Nepal, the TA will be linked to the \nproposed 2013 Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project, which will focus on improving water \nsecurity through integrated river basin management and increased water availability in the dry \nseason. \n \n12.  The outputs will be (i) detailed plans for application of locally appropriate innovations in \nselected irrigation systems of the three DMCs; (ii) creation of capacity to monitor impacts of \ntechnology  adoption  and  management  on  water  use  efficiency  and  crop  productivity;  and \n(iii) dissemination  of  innovative  models  combining  technologies,  enabling  policies,  and \ninstitutional frameworks.  These outputs will be achieved through (i) evaluating emerging water- \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n ", "4   \nsaving technologies,8 policies, and institutional arrangements9 for replication in countries where \nwater scarcity is an issue and specifically in the selected irrigation systems; (ii) identifying water \nallocation and incentive mechanisms to ensure that the new technologies lead to real water \nsavings; analyzing the progress, performance, and prospects for private sector roles10 in water-\nconserving agriculture; (iv) preparing location-specific guidelines for DMC policy makers to \nidentify technologies, policies, and institutions for producing more food with less water under \ndiffering physical, economic, and agroecological conditions; (v) designing and costing project \ncomponents  or  pilot  interventions  to  be  implemented  under  ADB  investment  projects;  (vi) \nestablishing  performance  benchmarking  and  monitoring  systems,  and  training  provided  in \nselected  systems;  and  (vii)  technical  review  and  feedback  by  experts  and  policy  makers, \ntogether with knowledge dissemination within and outside of ADB. \n  \n13.  Design of the TA assumes that concerns about climate change and water scarcity in \nAsia will prompt accelerated commitment to, and action on, needed reforms by all stakeholders. \nIt is also assumed that future income growth in Asia will provide the market incentives for \nagricultural growth, including diversification into more water-efficient crops (e.g., vegetables and \nfruits) and cropping practices. In the participating DMCs, risks to the TA include lack of technical \ncapacity and, especially in Bangladesh, lack of sufficient hydrological data for performance \nbenchmarking. These risks are mitigated by (i) linking the TA to the preparation of ADB loans, \nwhich will involve required capacity building and policy dialogue; and (ii) undertaking a full year \nof data collection to establish the necessary baselines. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,440,000 equivalent, of which $1,400,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The \nInternational Water Management Institute (IWMI) will finance an equivalent of $40,000 for staff \ntime, office space, and research and administrative support. Details are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. Because of the IWMI\u2019s long track record \nand internationally recognized research work in water resources and irrigation, and its extensive \nnetwork in South Asia, it will implement task 1. ADB will execute a memorandum of agreement \nwith the IWMI describing the terms of reference, the detailed aspects of the research work, and \nIWMI\u2019s responsibilities with respect to (i) timely delivery of quality outputs, (ii) regular monitoring \nand  evaluation  of  TA  results,  and  (iii)  reporting  and  other  communications.  An  inception \nworkshop will be held about 2 months after approval of the TA to agree on a detailed work plan \nand  milestones  for  tasks  1  and  2.  The  IWMI  will  submit  the  following  reports  to  ADB: \n(i) inception report, (ii) semiannual progress reports, (iii) semiannual financial statements, (iv) \naudited annual financial statements, (v) draft final report, and (vi) final report. The inception \n                                                \n8  These may include, among others, using recycled waste water; optimizing conjunctive surface and \ngroundwater irrigation in areas with significant groundwater use; low-cost laser land leveling; drip and \nmicro  irrigation;  using  drought-resistant  varieties;  and  water-conserving  crop  practices  such  as \nalternative wetting and drying of rice fields, minimum tillage. \n9  Policy  examples  are  pricing  arrangements  in  pump  irrigation  systems,  licensing  schemes  for \ngroundwater development, development of water markets, and rationing of agricultural water involving \nthe sale of water from agriculture to cities and industries and the use of the proceeds for reinvestment \nin agricultural productivity enhancement. \n10 These include private sector or corporatized management systems for medium- and large-scale irrigation systems \n(including the roles of autonomous water users\u2019 associations), private irrigation and land leveling services, and use \nof drip and pump irrigation equipment and other water-saving instruments and technologies. \n ", "  5 \nreport will be submitted within 2 months of the start of the project; the semiannual progress \nreports and financial statements every 6 months; and the final report within 2 months of project \nclosure. Funds will be drawn down in semiannual installments based on IWMI\u2019s estimate of \nforthcoming expenditures, and subject to satisfactory liquidation of expenditures for previously \ndisbursed  funds.  The  amounts  drawn  down  will  be  liquidated  against  the  statement  of \nexpenditures.  Disbursements  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n16.  For task 2, ADB, through the Regional and Sustainable Development Department and \nthe South Asia Department, will be the implementing agency in coordination with concerned \nagencies of water resources, irrigation and agriculture in the participating DMCs. Before starting \nactivities within a DMC, receipt of a no-objection letter from the government of such DMC will be \nrequired.  \n \n17.  The TA will require an estimated 33.0 person-months of international consultants and \n63.5 person-months  of  national  consultants  in  the  areas  of  irrigation  management,  design, \nperformance benchmarking, groundwater and conjunctive use, irrigation institutions and policy, \nparticipatory irrigation management, operation and maintenance, irrigated crop agronomy, and \neconomics (Appendix 3). For task 1, IWMI will recruit on an individual basis, in consultation with \nADB, 11.0 person-months of international and 2.5 person-months of national consulting services \nin the fields of irrigation policy, technology, management, institutions, groundwater irrigation, \nand economics. The curriculum vitae of proposed individual consultants will be approved by \nADB before an individual consultant may be recruited by IWMI. For task 2, ADB will recruit on \nan individual basis the equivalent of 22 person-months of international consultants and 61 \nperson-months of national consultants. The Regional and Sustainable Development Department \nand the South Asia Department will jointly agree on the selection of the experts. The South Asia \nDepartment  will  supervise  the  individual  consultants  at  the  country  level  to  ensure  timely \ndelivery of quality outputs. All consultants for tasks 1 and 2 will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment, \ngoods, and related services will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  equipment  will  be  turned  over  to  the  relevant \nparticipating government agencies upon completion of the TA. The TA will be implemented over \na 2-year period to start in December 2011 and conclude in November 2013. \n \n18.  Outputs of the TA will include a major ADB knowledge product and individual country \nreports, which will be disseminated on ADB\u2019s website; two regional seminars; and three high-\nlevel national workshops to share the knowledge and lessons, and showcase the most highly \nsuccessful  pilot  initiatives.  International  organizations  (such  as  the  Food  and  Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations, the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage, \nand the International Programme for Technology and Research in Irrigation and Drainage, \namong others) will be invited to the seminars and to provide critical review of the major TA \nreports. Within ADB, results of the TA will be disseminated through the communities of practice \nfor water, and agriculture, rural development, and food security. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,400,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Innovations for More Food with Less \nWater, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2020    Assumption \nA more water- Improved water efficiency  Benefit, monitoring, and  Income growth and \nefficient and reliable  in target irrigation systems  evaluation systems  increased awareness \nfood supply in  with crop yield increases of  established under new  of need to produce \nparticipating DMCs  at least 10% covering at  ADB projects  more with less water; \nby 2020   least 100,000 hectares, and  Data on water use and  provide suitable \n50,000 poor farm  productivity in target  economic incentives \nhouseholds (2011 baseline)  irrigation systems, using  for farm diversification \n  baselines established  into crops with lower \nFinancing for more water- under the TA  water demands \nefficient irrigation of  Project documents and \n$500 million annually in  concept papers of ADB, \nSouth Asia (2011 baseline)  World Bank, and others  \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nTechnically,  TA recommendations  Monitoring of ADB and  Concerns about \neconomically, and  applied in the design of  other development  climate change and \nenvironmentally  new ADB projects in the  partner lending  water scarcity prompt \nsound technologies  participating DMCs by 2014  operations, project  accelerated action on \nand associated  (2011 baseline: none)  preparatory TA surveys  needed reforms by all \ninstitutional and    of farmer acceptance,  stakeholders \npolicy frameworks  feedback from \nTA recommendations  Risk  \nready for scaling up  government policy \nrecognized as good  DMCs lack technical \nin future operations  makers  \npractices in the operations  capacity for necessary \nby ADB and other \nof ADB and other  Independent  policy and institutional \ndevelopment \ndevelopment partners by  assessments by national  reforms \npartners  \n2017 (2011 baseline: none)  and international experts \n  Feedback from ADB \ncommunities of practice, \nmission leaders working \nin other DMCs, local civil \nsociety, and other \nspecialist groups \nOutputs  By 2013    Assumption \n1.
