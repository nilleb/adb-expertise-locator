During the Country Programming Mission in April 2005, the Government of the Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) confirmed the request for Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) technical assistance (TA) to support capacity building for gender mainstreaming.1 The TA \nis included in the 2005 TA program in Lao PDR country strategy and program update (2006\u2013\n2008).2 The TA Fact-Finding Mission3 visited Lao PDR from 21 to 30 April 2005 and held \ndiscussions  with  the  Government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  activities,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. \nThe Government confirmed the mission\u2019s aide memoire on 29 June 2005. The TA framework is \nin Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES4 \n2.  Agriculture accounts for 50% of the Lao PDR\u2019s gross domestic product and employs \nover 80% of the total labor force, mainly for subsistence. The Government recognizes that \nmodernizing and strengthening the agriculture sector is critical to its goal of poverty reduction. \nRural  women  play  vital  roles  as  farmers  and  agroprocessors,  raisers  of  small  livestock, \nharvesters of nontimber forest products, producers of handicrafts and other nonfarm products, \nand  traders.  Gender  roles  in  agriculture  can  vary  considerably,  often  related  to  ethnicity, \nlocation, type of farming system, use of technology, and other factors. Gender roles are also \nchanging rapidly as more farming households diversify into cash crops, as communities relocate \nfrom upland areas to amalgamated villages closer to roads and towns, and as government \npolicies change the allocation of rural land and influence farming practices.  \n \n3.  As it has direct bearing on poverty reduction, gender equality is one of the intersectoral \npriorities of the Government\u2019s National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES). The \nNGPES gender strategy for poverty reduction stipulates several measures to better support \nwomen farmers\u2019 productive capacity and local knowledge. These include (i) inclusion of women \nin project activities, (ii) equal participation of women in extension services and training, (iii) use \nof gender-related indicators to monitor projects, (iv) increase in the number of female provincial \nand district staff and extension workers, and (v) gender focal points in villages to promote \nimproved agricultural practices.  \n \n4.  To support, promote, and protect the benefits and rights of women in all aspects, the \nGovernment  established  the  National  Commission  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  (Lao-\nNCAW) in April 2003. To help Lao-NCAW effectively carry out its mandate, subcommissions for \nthe advancement of women (Sub-CAWs) were set up within 11 ministries and offices, including \nthe ministries of agriculture and forestry, education, foreign affairs, industry and handicraft, \ninformation  and  culture,  justice,  labor  and  social  welfare,  national  security,  public  health; \nCommittee for Planning and Investment; and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. Lao-NCAW is currently \ndrafting the national strategy for the advancement of women (2006\u20132010) with sector and \nthematic  inputs  from  the  Sub-CAWs  and  their  secretariats.  Once  the  national  strategy  is \napproved, the Sub-CAWs are expected to facilitate its implementation in the respective line \nministries and offices.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 9 May 2005.  \n2  ADB. 2005.

Lao PDR Country Gender Assessment: Gender, Poverty and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Manila.  ", "2   \n5.  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) recently prepared a cross-sector \nproject to achieve gender equality and poverty reduction: Gender Empowerment for Poverty \nReduction: Building Capacity for Stronger Policy and Practice.5 The project will support key \ninstitutions  including  Lao-NCAW,  Lao  Women's  Union,  Gender  Resource  Information  and \nDevelopment Center, Committee for Planning and Investment, and Ministry of Finance. The \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) is identified as a model ministry for gender and \npoverty mainstreaming. The TA was prepared in close consultation with the UNDP project \nformulation team. Because of its horizontal and vertical linkage to the UNDP project, the TA is \nexpected to produce wide-ranging results and multiplier impact. Close coordination will be \nmaintained during TA implementation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  In  accordance  with  the  NGPES  gender  strategy  and  draft  MAF  strategy  for  the \nadvancement of women,6 the purpose of the TA is to reduce gender disparities and increase \nwomen\u2019s productivity in agriculture, and thus reduce poverty and promote growth. The specific \nTA objectives are to (i) build gender-responsive institutional structures and systems at MAF, (ii) \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  MAF  officials  and  selected  provincial  and  district  office  staff  to \nincorporate gender dimensions in MAF's policies, strategies, programs, and projects; and (iii) \ndeliver gender-sensitive and pro-poor agricultural extension services. Critical findings and major \nrecommendations of the special evaluation study are on capacity development7 have been \nreflected in the design of the TA, including the focus on the diagnostic stage and human \nresource management through a structured and sequential capacity development program. \n \n7.  The key TA outputs will include (i) improved institutional setup, systems, procedures, \nand medium-term framework to effectively integrate and monitor gender mainstreaming at MAF; \n(ii) increased gender awareness and gender mainstreaming capacity and skills of key personnel \nin the agriculture sector; and (iii) improved women\u2019s access to agricultural extension services.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Many factors limit women\u2019s productivity in agricultural production. The constraints are \ninterrelated and need to be addressed systematically. Thus, the TA will focus on three major \nconstraints: (i) institutional and procedural factors, such as lack of appropriate systems and of \nclarity in relation to functions, roles, and responsibilities for gender mainstreaming; (ii) human \nresource and capacity factors, including lack of awareness, knowledge, and skills on the part of \nstaff in MAF and provincial and district agriculture and forestry offices on gender issues; and (iii) \naccess and control factors, such as the absence of gender-responsive support services and \nservice delivery. By addressing these three factors concurrently, the TA will develop an effective \nand sustainable structure and environment to enhance the role of women in the agriculture \nsector and empower them, thus reducing poverty and inequality.  \n                                                 \n5  Preliminary activities will commence in late 2005, and the main phase will be implemented from 2006 to 2008. \n6  Currently under preparation, addressing (i) employment creation, (ii) expansion of income-generating opportunities \nto reduce poverty, and (iii) enhancing knowledge relating to agricultural production.  \n7  ADB. 2004. Special Evaluation Study on Capacity Development Assistance of the Asian Development Bank to the \nLao People's Democratic Republic. Manila. \n ", "  3\n1.  Creating an Institutional Framework for Gender Mainstreaming \n9.  Under this component, MAF\u2019s organizational and personnel management systems and \nprocedures will be assessed, and recommendations made for improvements. First, an inventory \nof  MAF  human  resources,  in  the  national  office,  a  pilot  province  (to  be  identified  later  in \naccordance  with  criteria  to  be  developed  during  TA  implementation),  and  districts  will  be \nprepared. Existing individual job descriptions will be collected. Subsequently with participatory \nmethods, the current roles and responsibilities of MAF departments, provincial agriculture and \nforestry offices, and district agriculture and forestry extension offices will be examined with \nregard to gender mainstreaming. The review will focus on how to integrate gender perspectives \ninto MAF\u2019s overall planning cycle and how to track the link between plans, human resources, \nand  budgets.8  The  TA  will  help  establish  systems  and  procedures  for  the  technical  line \ndepartments to screen all new policies, programs, and projects from a gender perspective. A \nnew gender mainstreaming framework will be integrated into standard MAF operations. The \naction  plan  in  the  forthcoming  MAF  Strategy  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  will  be \nimplemented in accordance with this framework.  \n \n10.  The NGPES gender strategy calls for improving the gender and ethnic balance of all \nstaffing in line ministries. The exclusion of women from participation in government decision \nmaking means that gender-based needs are not properly considered and addressed, and that \nsector policies and programs are incomplete. The TA will examine the current situation in MAF \nand make recommendations to reduce gender disparities in recruitment, transfers, promotions, \nand career development. The TA will also explore means to increase the number of female \nagricultural extension workers in both the short and medium term.  \n \n11.  Effective planning will require accurate and updated information on gender relations and \ngender disparities. Gender-disaggregated data has been collected by MAF; however the data \nhas not been analyzed to reveal gender disparities nor has it subsequently been used in the \nplanning process. In cooperation with the standardized data collection format under the Gender \nEmpowerment  for  Poverty  Reduction  Project  (para.  5),  the  TA  will  facilitate  MAF's  use  of \ngender-disaggregated data for application in the planning cycle.  \n \n2.  Building Capacity for Gender Mainstreaming \n12.  By providing training and capacity-building support for MAF, this component aims to link \nthe existing human resources, staff job requirements, and department objectives, to build a \nmore gender-responsive institution. The inventory prepared and the roles and responsibilities of \nthe departments identified under component 1 will form the basis for the activities. Training will \nbe provided to fill the gap between functions required for gender mainstreaming and current \nstaff knowledge and skills. The TA will utilize existing gender training materials available within \nMAF. \n \n13.  The MAF staff trained on gender issues will form a network and be strengthened to \nbecome a key in-house training resource. Under the TA, these in-house trainers will work with \nthe external specialists to conduct training programs. All MAF senior staff will be trained on \ngender awareness and basic gender issues in agriculture. MAF Sub-CAW Secretariat members \n                                                 \n8  For introduction of the gender budgeting concepts and systems, collaborative and complementary support will be \nprovided from the Gender Sensitive and Pro-poor Budget Initiative under the Gender Empowerment for Poverty \nReduction Project.  \n ", "4   \nand department gender focal points will receive intensive training to enable them to function \neffectively as advocates and facilitators for gender mainstreaming.  \n \n3.  Gender-Sensitive and Pro-Poor Agricultural Extension Services \n14.  Gender sensitivity is one of the principles in the comprehensive extension strategy in the \nLao PDR, which introduced the community-based and participatory village extension system.9 \nThe strategy acknowledges that men and women play different roles in agricultural production, \nand face different constraints and opportunities in accessing resources and services. In line with \nthe new mandate of the government extension service, this TA component will elaborate and \nimplement  the  gender-integrated,  gender-sensitive,  and  pro-poor  extension  service  delivery \nmodels to meet the needs of target beneficiaries. Specific attention will be paid to the varied \ngender roles in agriculture, which are often related to ethnicity, location, type of farming system, \nuse of technology, etc.  \n \n4.  Pilot Activities for Capacity Building \n15.  This component will apply and test the gender mainstreaming framework in the field and \nsupport building provincial and district staff capacity through on-the-job training. In the new \nextension service structure, provincial and district staff are to be trained to be farming system \nextension workers, and the latter are expected to regularly interact with local communities, \nvillage  extension  workers,  and  farmers  to  understand  their  expressed  needs.  Under  this \ncomponent provincial agriculture and forestry extension centers and district agriculture and \nforestry extension offices will prepare action plans translating the sector gender mainstreaming \nobjectives and strategic priorities into local pilot activities. Such activities may include village \nparticipatory  planning,  extension  services  targeted  to  specific  subjects,  and  livelihood \nimprovement and skill development support.10 Detailed activities will be developed through a \nparticipatory process approach.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $471,000 equivalent, of which $250,000 is the \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $221,000  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide \n$400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $150,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $71,000, in kind \nthrough the provision of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other related services and \nfacilities. Cost estimates and the financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  MAF will be the Executing Agency for the TA; the head of MAF's Sub-CAW Secretariat \nwill be the TA director. MAF's Sub-CAW Secretariat members will be the counterparts of the TA \nconsultant team, and will liaise with the gender focal points of the departments of planning and \npersonnel, the permanent secretary's office, and the national agriculture and forestry extension \n                                                 \n9  National Agriculture and Forestry Extension Service.

Provincial agriculture and forestry \nextension centers and district agriculture and forestry extension offices will be in charge of \nimplementation of the pilot activities. The chair of MAF's Sub-CAW (vice minister, MAF and \ncommissioner of Lao-NCAW) will provide overall guidance and oversee implementation of all TA \nactivities. The TA will be implemented in close coordination with the project management team \nfor the Gender Empowerment for Poverty Reduction Project and will report the TA\u2019s major \nachievements  and  milestone  outputs  to  the  Central  Project  Advisory  Board  of  the  same \nproject.11 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\u2019 forthcoming capacity-\nbuilding project12 will support, on a parallel basis, the development of a ministry-wide gender \nmainstreaming policy and implementation plan. The TA will take a process approach with \nphased  planning  and  execution  of  each  component.  Periodic  monitoring,  feedback,  and \nevaluation will be carried out as an integral part of the TA; and the findings will be fed back for \nthe design of subsequent capacity-building activities.  \n \n18.  The TA, to be implemented over 18 months from January 2006 to June 2007, will require \n25  person-months  of  consulting  services:  10  person-months  of  international  consulting  in \ninstitutional development and planning, participatory consultation and systemic learning, and \ngender analysis; 15 person-months of domestic consulting in human resource development and \ntraining and agricultural extension services. Appendix 3 provides the outline terms of reference. \nThe consultants will submit inception, midterm, final, and quarterly progress reports to ADB.  \n \n19.  ADB will select and engage the consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. ADB\u2019s standard quality- and \ncost-based selection method will be used, and technical proposals invited from short-listed \nconsulting  firms  will  be  in  ADB\u2019s  simplified  formats.  Equipment  for  the  consultant  will  be \nfinanced by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment procured \nunder the TA will become the property of the Government upon completion of the TA. \n \n20.  The TA outputs will be presented and shared at MAF through meetings and seminars \norganized  by  the  MAF  Sub-CAW  Secretariat.  The  outcome  and  lessons  learned  will  be \ndisseminated  nationwide13  and  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  Gender  Empowerment  for \nPoverty Reduction Project will synthesize all activities and develop a gender mainstreaming tool \nkit for the Lao PDR, for future scaling up and replication by other ministries and sectors. \n \nIV.
