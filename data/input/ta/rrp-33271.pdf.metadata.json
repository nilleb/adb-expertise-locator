Poverty Impact Assessment  ", " \n  PROGRAM, LOAN, GUARANTEE, AND INVESTMENT SUMMARY \n \n \nBorrower   Islamic Republic of Pakistan  \n \nThe Proposal    Support  for  the  Government\u2019s  Financial  (Nonbank)  Markets  and \n  Governance (FMG) Program, comprising  (i) a program loan for FMG \npolicy  reforms;  (ii)  two  technical  assistance  (TA)  loans:  one  for \nstrengthening pension, insurance, and savings systems; and one for \nstrengthening regulation, enforcement, and governance of nonbank \nfinancial markets; and (iii) two political risk guarantees (PRGs) with \ncounterindemnity  by  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan:  one  for \nenhancing  Pakistan\u2019s  integration  with  international  capital  markets; \nand one for enhancing access to cover for selected violence-related \nrisks  following  the  terrorist  attacks  on  11  September  2001  in  the \nUnited States (US). \n \nThe Program   \n   \n  Rationale  To  finance  the  expansion  of  its  economic  base  and  generate \n  employment, Pakistan requires a wide range of financial services and \n  instruments  beyond  what  can  be  provided  by  the  banking  sector. \nBroadening  and  deepening  of  the  financial  system  through \ndevelopment  of  nonbank  financial  products  and  services  is  also \nrequired to reduce financial sector vulnerabilities and systemic risks \nassociated with a banking crisis, the impacts of which are often most \nsevere for the poor.  \n \nNonbank financial markets, in particular capital markets, are needed \nfor sustainable mobilization of long-term savings and investment. This \nis closely linked to the development of life insurance and pension \nsystems, which fulfill an important social role in old-age protection, as \nwell as general insurance to protect against a variety of risks that can \nundermine economic development. Institutional investors also play an \nimportant  role  in  improving  corporate  governance  and  information \ndisclosure.  The  Asian  Crisis,  in  particular,  has  highlighted  the \nimportance of good corporate governance and sound financial risk \nmanagement for sustainable economic growth.  \n \nPakistan  has  since  the  mid\u20131990s  embarked  on  comprehensive \nfinancial sector reforms. The Capital Markets Development Program, \nimplemented successfully over 1997\u20132001 with Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  support,  established  a  necessary  foundation  for  the \nsustainable development of nonbank financial markets. Yet, despite \ngood progress in particular on the regulatory and infrastructure side, \nPakistan\u2019s nonbank financial markets remain narrow and lack depth, \nas investors have so far not realized their full market potential. Further \ninitiatives and reforms are required in particular to strengthen investor \nconfidence in the integrity and robustness of markets, and bring about \na lasting economic impact.  ", "  iii\n  Objectives and  The  overall  goal  of  the  Program  is  to  facilitate  private  sector-led \n  Scope   productivity  growth  as  well  as  social  protection.  It  thus  aims  to \n  contribute to poverty reduction indirectly.  \n   \nThe purpose of the Program is to support the Government\u2019s financial \nsector reform agenda, and development of capital markets and other \nnonbank financial services. The immediate objectives of the Program \nare  to  (i)  strengthen  investor  confidence  through  improved \ngovernance, transparency, and investor protection; (ii) increase the \ndepth  and  diversity  of  financial  intermediation  through  new  capital \nmarket  issues  for  saving  and  investment;  (iii)  improve  operational \nefficiency  and  risk  management  of  intermediaries;  and  (iv)  reduce \nfinancial sector vulnerabilities. \n \nThe  reform  agenda  is  structured  around  five  components:  (i) \nimprovement  in  the  fiscal,  interest  rate,  and  investment  policy \nenvironment; (ii) improvement in governance of market participants \nand transparency in information disclosure; (iii) increase in supply of \nfinancial instruments and improvements in market infrastructure; (iv) \nincrease in demand for financial instruments through development of \ncontractual savings and institutional investment; and (v) development \nof related financial services and institutions. \n \nThe Program's reform agenda is supported by two TA loans: one for \nstrengthening of pension, insurance, and savings systems; and one for \nstrengthening regulation, enforcement, and governance of nonbank \nfinancial markets. The Program is complemented further through non-\nlending  initiatives  including  ADB\u2019s  guarantee  products  to  enhance \nintegration  of  Pakistan\u2019s  financial  markets  with  international  capital \nflows;  and  to  ensure  continued  access  to  cover  for  selected \nnoncommercial  risks,  which  was  withdrawn  by  the  international \ninsurance  industry  following  the  terrorist  events  in  the  US  on  11 \nSeptember 2001. \n \n  Poverty  Other \n  Classification   \n   \n  Thematic  Good Governance; Private Sector Development \n  Classification   \n   \n  Environmental  Category C \n  Classification \n \nThe Program Loan   \n   \n  Amount and  A loan of $260 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \n  Terms  provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \n  lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \n  period  of  3  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0%,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum; conversion options that may \n   ", "iv  \nbe exercised in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in \nthe Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations, and ADB\u2019s Conversion \nGuidelines;  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan \nAgreement. \n \n  Program Period  The  FMG  Program  period  extends  to  December  2005.  The \n  and  Tranching  Government will be able to withdraw funds from the loan account for a \n  period  of  about  3  years  starting  from  loan  effectiveness  up  to  31 \n  December 2005.  \n   \nThe  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  tranches  based  on  performance  in \nmeeting  specified  tranche  release  conditions.  The  first  tranche, \nequivalent  to  $100  million,  will  be  made  available  upon  loan \neffectiveness following up-front compliance with specified conditions. \nThe second tranche will be released upon satisfactory compliance with \n18  specified  conditions,  as  well  as  continued  compliance  with  all \nprevious  tranche  conditions.  To  provide  an  incentive  for  early \ncompliance,  an  incentive  release  of  $80  million  under  the  second \ntranche can be made as soon as any nine of the second tranche \nrelease conditions have been met, expected by November 2003. The \nfinal release of the second tranche of $80 million will take place upon \nsatisfactory compliance with the remaining conditions, expected by \nNovember 2004. \n \n  Executing  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency. It will \n  Agency  monitor and facilitate overall implementation of the FMG Program and \nadminister  the  utilization  of  loan  proceeds.  MOF  will  also  ensure \ncompliance  with  all  policy-related  conditions.  The  Securities  and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) will be the implementing \nagency,  with  full  responsibility  for  implementation  of  all  conditions \nwithin its regulatory and development mandate. MOF and SECP will \nensure effective coordination through existing mechanisms with other \nconcerned agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of \nLabor,  Privatization  Commission,  State  Bank  of  Pakistan,  and  the \nprivate sector as appropriate. \n \n  Procurement  The loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local \nduties and taxes) of imports procured in and from the ADB\u2019s member \ncountries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible items and \nthose items financed by other multilateral and bilateral official sources.  \nThe Borrower will certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds the \namount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the program loan in a \ngiven period. ADB will have the right to audit the use of loan proceeds \nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \nCounterpart   The counterpart funds, to be generated out of the loan proceeds, will \nFunds  be used to finance the cost of structural adjustment, including the \n  establishment of funds and facilities under the FMG Program, and to \nfinance high priority social and human development projects, including \nsocial protection for the poor.  \n \n ", "  v\nTechnical Assistance  Two TA loans, for a total of $6 million equivalent, will be provided for \nLoans  capacity  building  associated  with  the  FMG  Program  from  ADB\u2019s \n  Special Funds resources. The loans will have a term of 32 years, \n  including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \n  during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such \n  other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \n  those set forth in the TA Loan Agreements. \n   \nStrengthening  This TA will develop solutions to improve Pakistan\u2019s pension system \nPension,  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  key  government  institutions  in  the \nInsurance, and  mobilization  and  management  of  contractual  savings.  The  TA  will \nSaving Systems   comprise five components, including (i) establishment of an overall \n  framework for pension provision; (ii) financial assessment of civil and \n  military pension schemes; (iii) institutional reform and strengthening of \n  the Employee\u2019s Old-age Benefits Institution; (iv) capacity building for \n  investment management in the State Life Insurance Corporation; and \n  (v) institutional reform and strengthening of the Central Directorate of \n  National Savings. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $4.5 \n  million equivalent, comprising $2.4 million in foreign exchange costs \n  and $2.1 million equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance $3 \n  million equivalent comprising the full foreign exchange costs and $0.6 \n  million equivalent in local currency costs. \n   \nStrengthening  This  TA  will  ensure  sustainable  development  of  nonbank  financial \nRegulation,  markets and protection of investors and policy holders. It will comprise \nEnforcement, and  four  components:  (i)  further  improvement  of  legal  and  regulatory \nGovernance of  frameworks; (ii) capacity building of SECP with particular attention to \nNonbank  its  enlarged  mandate  for  regulation  and  supervision  of  nonbank \nFinancial Markets  financial  institutions,  insurance,  and  pensions;  (iii)  support  for \nrestructuring of stock exchanges; and (iv) establishment of sustainable \n \nmechanisms for skills development and training. The total cost of the \n \nTA  is  estimated  to  be  $4.4  million  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange costs of $2.4 million and local currency costs of $2.0 million \nequivalent. ADB will finance $3 million equivalent comprising the entire \nforeign exchange costs and $0.6 million equivalent in local currency \ncosts. \n \nPolitical Risk Guarantee  Two  revolving  facilities  will  be  established  that  provide  PRGs  to \nFacilities  enhance Pakistan\u2019s access to international capital flows and promote \n  soundness of investment and financial markets, for a total guarantee \n  volume of up to $200 million equivalent. The PRG facilities will be \n  promoted in conjunction with the other FMG Program initiatives. All \n  PRGs  issued  under  the  facilities  will  be  counterguaranteed  and \n  indemnified by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The PRGs may be \n  administered  on  behalf  of  ADB  through  facility  agents  selected \n  according to normal commercial procedures.   \n   \n  The  facilities  will  be  available  for  a  period  of  4  years  from  their \n  effective date, during which new PRGs may be issued to replace those \n  that are canceled or have expired. Each PRG issued under the facility \n  may have a maximum term of up to 10 years. \n   ", "vi  \n  ADB will charge a one-time front-end fee of up to 1% percent for each \n  PRG issued, in line with ADB\u2019s guarantee policies and payable on the \n  nominal amount of each guarantee issued. ADB will also charge a \n  PRG fee of 0.4% per annum on the aggregate value of all liabilities \n  outstanding  under  each  PRG,  calculated  on  a  daily  basis  and \n  collected periodically. Each beneficiary of a PRG will pay a market-\n  based fee, as a percentage per annum of the guaranteed amount, \n  which will be determined prior to the PRGs becoming available and \n  which may be changed from time to time. Any surplus generated by \n  the facilities, after deduction of all expenses for establishment and \n  operation, will be capitalized to build up a claims reserve or otherwise \n  utilized as agreed upon between ADB and the Government.  \n   \nEnhancing  To  enhance  integration  of  Pakistan\u2019s  financial  markets  with \nPakistan\u2019s  international  capital  flows,  ADB  will  guarantee  to  international \nIntegration with  investors  payment  of  proceeds  from  eligible  investments  if  that \nInternational  payment  is  not  made  as  a  result  of  a  guaranteed  risk,  including \nCapital Markets   restriction  on  foreign  exchange  convertibility  and  transferability \n  blockage. The PRG facility will, however, not cover any risks that \n  affect  the  value  of  the  investment  itself.  The  maximum  aggregate \n  liability under the PRG facility covered by ADB at any time will not \n  exceed $25 million equivalent. The PRG facility may be enhanced \n  through private sector political risk insurance providers under ADB\u2019s \n  coguarantee program. \n   \nEnhancing  To ensure availability of insurance cover for selected violence-related \nAccess to Cover  risks that is not readily available in the commercial market following \nfor Selected  the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September 2001, and thus to \nViolence-related  protect economic and financial sector soundness, ADB will guarantee \nRisks  payment of a certain amount to a guaranteed party in case terrorism or \nother political violence risk as specified under the PRG policy occurs. \nThe maximum aggregate liability under the PRG facility covered by \nADB at any time will not exceed $175 million equivalent, but the PRG \nfacility  may  be  enhanced  through  coguarantee  and  commercial \nreinsurance arrangements. \n \nProgram Benefits and  The  overall  outcome  of  the  Program  will  be  a  vibrant,  diversified, \nBeneficiaries  efficient, and sustainable financial market offering a wide range of \n  nonbank products and instruments for saving and investment in a well-\n  regulated  sector  environment.  This  will  contribute  to  productivity \ngrowth, employment generation, and strengthening of social safety \nnets, as well as fiscal and financial sector stability. \n \nSpecifically, the following benefits will accrue: (i) improved resource \nmobilization  and  access  to  financing  of  economic  expansion  from \ndomestic and foreign sources; (ii) wider choice of funding and saving \ninstruments accessible to the corporate sector and general public, at \nmore competitive pricing that does not penalize for inefficiencies in the \nbanking sector;  (iii) greater flexibility and improved risk management \nfor institutional investors; (iv) increased investment skills and better \nadvisory  service  to  benefit  the  general  public;  (v)  increased \n ", "  vii\ntransparency,  information  disclosure,  and  investor  protection;  (vi) \ndiversification and deepening of the financial sector with less reliance \non the banking sector, reducing vulnerability to financial sector crisis, \nwhich often has its most severe impact on the poor; (vii) enhanced \nsocial  protection  through  a  wider  range  of  insurance  and  old-age \nprotection  products,  with  greater  client  orientation  and  outreach \nincluding to the poor on a sustainable basis; and (viii) improved public \nfinances through increased tax revenue in the medium to long term as \na result of increased saving and investment, as well as a defined \nmechanism to deal with selected violence-related risks that can no \nlonger be covered commercially. \n \nRisks and Safeguards  Implementation of the FMG Program is facing a number of key risks, \n  for which mitigating measures have been put in place as appropriate. \n  (cid:1)  High  short-term  adjustment  costs,  causing  fiscal  disruption. \n  Adjustment cost has been reflected in the revenue targets agreed \n  upon  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  under  the  Poverty \n  Reduction and Growth Facility, conservative collection targets for tax \n  revenue from financial instruments have been applied, and incentives \n  for tax benefits have been capped. \n(cid:1)  Change  of  government  policies  and  reversal  of  reform  process. \nImplementation of the reform agenda will to a large extent rely on the \nprivate  sector,  which  strongly  supports  and  has  been  involved  in \nformulation  of  the  Program.  Wide  stakeholder  consultation  during \nprocessing sought to ensure awareness and broad-based ownership \nfor the reforms. In September 2002, the State Bank of Pakistan was \nmade a constitutional body with independence for monetary policies \nshielded from government interference. \n(cid:1) Political interference into regulatory matters. The regulator has been \ngiven a transparent governance framework with strong legal protection \nfrom direct government interference.  \n(cid:1) Insufficient capacity and integrity of the regulator. TA support will be \nprovided  under  the  Program  to  further  upgrade  skills;  financial \nautonomy will allow the regulator to attract and retain competent staff. \n(cid:1) Slow progress in reforming key institutions, including Employees \nOld-Age Benefits Institution and State Life Insurance Corporation. TA \nsupport  for  institutional  development  will  be  provided  under  the \nProgram; continued dialogue with ADB will support proreform forces. \n(cid:1)  Inadequate  implementation  of  governance  and  risk  management \nstandards due to vested interests. The private sector and a wide range \nof stakeholders will be involved in program implementation to lessen \ndependence on a single lobbying group; the establishment of a private \nsector-driven  corporate  governance  center  will  raise  governance \nstandards and awareness. \n(cid:1) Macroeconomic outlook worsening due to external global or regional \ndevelopments.  As  elsewhere,  this  will  affect  the  performance  of \nPakistan's financial markets, but reform measures under the Program \nwill  increase  financial  sector  resilience  and  lessen  the  impact  of \nexternal shocks. \n   ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation to support the \nFinancial  (Nonbank)  Markets  and  Governance  (FMG)  Program  in  the  Islamic  Republic  of \nPakistan.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) support will comprise (i) a program loan for FMG \npolicy  reforms;  (ii)  two  technical  assistance  (TA)  loans:  one  for  strengthening  of  pension, \ninsurance,  and  savings  systems;  and  one  for  strengthening  regulation,  enforcement,  and \ngovernance of nonbank financial markets; and (iii) two political risk guarantee (PRG) facilities \nwith counterindemnity by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan: one to enhance Pakistan\u2019s integration \nwith international capital markets, and one to enhance access to cover for selected violence-\nrelated risks following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 in the United States (US). \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \n2.  Challenging Internal and External Environment. After a difficult period for Pakistan\u2019s \neconomy and frequent change in Government during much of the 1990s, the comprehensive \nstructural reforms initiated and accelerated in particular over the past 2 years at various levels \nhave now started to pay-off, and the macroeconomic situation has gradually stabilized.1 The \nevents following the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September 2001 have created a further \nchallenge for Pakistan with far-reaching economic, social, and political implications. On the \neconomic front, this has included a fall in industrial production, cancellation of export orders, \ndeclining international demand and prices, and reduced availability and rising cost of insurance. \n \n3.  Macroeconomic Stability Maintained. The Government has responded skillfully to the \nconsiderable challenges it has been facing, and macro indicators reflect this: growth for fiscal \nyear  (FY)  2002  was  3.6%,  only  slightly  below  the  3.7%  originally  targeted,  and  inflation \ncontinued to be under control at below 3%. The budget deficit was 7.1% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), higher than originally projected.2  Exports reached $9.1 billion, which is well short \nof the goal of $10.1 billion, but a larger fall in imports helped contain the trade deficit for FY2002 \nat  about  $1.2  billion  and  within  target.  Fuelled  by  increased  remittances  from  abroad,  an \nunexpectedly large current account surplus of about $2.7 billion could be achieved. Following \nthe successful rescheduling of its bilateral debt obligations and increased inflow of remittances \nand external aid, gross foreign exchange reserves increased to more than $8 billion by October \n2002, the highest amount ever, and the Pakistan rupee has stabilized and even strengthened. \nWithin  the  current  framework,  the  growth  target  of  5.2%  for  FY2003  looks  achievable. \nRecognizing these positive developments, international credit agencies have upgraded their \nfinancial risk ratings for Pakistan.3 However, amid continued regional tensions and uncertainties \nthe macroeconomic stabilization has so far failed to attract much investment. Foreign direct \ninvestment has remained low, at less than $500 million, and has been directed primarily towards \nthe energy sector. Likewise, international portfolio investment, which has been negative since \nmid-1998  and  declined  to  less  than  3%  of  market  capitalization,  has  yet  to  return  in  an \neconomically significant way. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Country Economic Review: Pakistan. Manila.  \n  State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). 2002. Annual Report. Available: http:// www.sbp.org.pk. \n2  The original target was set at 4.9%, but was subsequently revised to 5.3% and then  to 5.7%. The larger deficit was \nprimarily due to a shortfall in customs revenue, one time write-offs, and generally lower economic activity following \nthe events of 11 September 2001. This was only partly offset through spending cuts, including development \nexpenditure. Adjusting for one-time expenditures, the deficit is 5.7%, in line with revised targets. \n3  Moody\u2019s Investor Service has raised the rating for Pakistan\u2019s external debt and bank deposits to B3 and CAA1, \nrespectively. Standard & Poor\u2019s has affirmed its rating for foreign currency debt at \u201cB-\u201c and local debt at \u201cB+\u201d, with \n\u201cstable\u201d outlook. For further details see http://www.moodys.com and www.ratings.com. ", "2  \n \n4.  Weak Credit Expansion Despite Easing of Monetary Policy. Strong capital inflows, \nappreciation of the rupee and low inflation have provided room for easing of monetary policy. \nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) gradually reduced its discount rate from 14% in July 2001 to \n9% in early 2002, while treasury bill rates declined sharply and are now hovering around 6-7%, \ncompared with about 13% at the beginning of FY2002. Yet, the banking sector has not been \nwilling or able to fully translate this steep cut in interest rates into lower lending rates, which \nreflects both inefficiency and lack of competition in the financial sector.4 At the same time, \ndemand for credit has fallen due to lower cotton prices; a fall in working capital requirements, in \nparticular of textile manufacturers; and low investment levels following the uncertainties after 11 \nSeptember 2001. There has been some sign of a rebound in 2002. Further reduction of interest \nrates may be problematic, though, as this could trigger downward pressure on the Pakistan \nrupee. This would also cut into the commercial banks' interest earnings and thus inhibit their \nability to build up capital for dealing with their bad loan portfolio, as well as reduce tax revenue \nfor the Government.5 \n \n5.  Firm Commitment to Reforms. The Government has demonstrated strong commitment \nfor reform to its development partners, including the international finance institutions. For the first \ntime after several attempts, Pakistan was in 2001 able to successfully complete implementation \nof an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). IMF subsequently approved, in \nDecember 2001, a 3-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), for SDR1.03 billion. \nThis  provides  a  framework  for  further  reforms  and  macroeconomic  stabilization,  and \nimplementation of the PRGF to date is generally on track.6  \n \n6.  Poverty  Reduction  Remains  the  Key  Challenge.  Poverty  levels  in  Pakistan  have \nincreased since the early 1990s and are strongly correlated with the slowdown in economic \ngrowth. At the same time, inequality in income distribution worsened significantly, in particular in \nurban areas. A large share of employment is in the informal sector, without adequate social \nprotection, and the continued high population growth has put pressure on the labor market that it \nhas been unable to absorb.7 This has given rise to social tensions with far-reaching implications, \nand  is  believed  to  have  also  fuelled  extremist  groups.  To  counter  these  trends,  the \nGovernment\u2019s economic policies seek to uplift livelihood and create opportunities for the poor \nthrough support for employment-generating activities, more effective social sector spending, and \ngreater participation in decision making at the local level. Pro-poor outlays during FY2002, much \nof which took place at the provincial and local level, fell short of expectations, however, amid a \nshortfall in revenues and as local governments became operative only in late 2001. Appropriate \nmeasures are required to ensure that macroeconomic stabilization and adjustment programs \nyield visible benefits for the poor, and to mitigate disproportionate negative impacts that were \noften associated with reform programs in the past decade. \n \n7.  Continued  Support  Warranted.  Despite  the  considerable  external  and  internal \nchallenges. Pakistan has been able to credibly keep its reform program on track. However, \ntangible benefits have yet to emerge for a large share of the population. For private sector \ninvestors, Pakistan remains a place with both high risks and great opportunities. Therefore, it is \n                                                 \n4  Average combined lending rates for all banks fell from 14.4% in July 2001 to only about 12% in February 2002, \nalbeit with considerable variation among the banks. Foreign banks tend to be more competitive in their rates than \nthe nationalized commercial banks. Average deposit rates declined only marginally, from about 5% to 4.6%. \n5  For a more detailed overview of Pakistan's monetary and fiscal policy, see http://www.sbp.org.pk/monetary.htm. \n6  Details  of  the  PRGF  as  well  as  progress  in  implementation  can  be  accessed  through  the  IMF  website: \nhttp://www.imf.org. \n7  For further details on Pakistan labor market and challenges, see International Labor Organization. 2000.

THE SECTOR  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s country strategy program (CSP) for 2002-20048 as well as the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment  agenda,  articulated  in  a  number  of  documents,9  give  high  priority  to  poverty \nreduction through private sector-led pro-poor economic growth, social sector development, and \nimproved governance. Within this overall framework, the financial sector has an important role to \nplay to increase resource mobilization, improve efficiency of allocation, enhance access to \nfinancial  products  and  services,  contribute  to  the  sustainability  of  social  safety  nets,  and \nsafeguard economic stability. \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n9.  Shallow  and  Narrow.  Pakistan\u2019s  financial  sector  is  not  very  large  and  diversified. \nDeposits amount to only about 56% of GDP.10 The money (M2) to GDP ratio \u2013 which is an \nindicator for financial sector deepening \u2013 at only about 44% suggests that a major portion of the \neconomy is still not monetized.11  \n \n10.  Heavy  Government  Involvement.  Despite  a  number  of  reforms  initiated  by  the \nGovernment in the past which have sought to reduce its operational involvement in the financial \nsector, the Government still plays a predominant role, and much financial intermediation is \ndriven  by  its  financing  needs.  In  2000,  about  65%  of  deposits  were  mobilized  through \ngovernment-owned  or  -controlled  institutions,  and  51%  of  credit  was  allocated  to  the \nGovernment, with an additional 4% to state-owned enterprises, leaving barely 45% for the \nprivate sector.12 The government-run National Savings Scheme (NSS), in particular, continues \nto plays a significant role in mobilizing savings from the general public and channeling those \ndirectly to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to meet Government expenditures rather than financing \nproductive assets. Savings mobilization and credit delivery, in particular in rural areas, are still \ndominated  by  government-owned  institutions.  In  addition,  the  country's  largest  institutional \ninvestors, including the State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC) and the Employees Old-Age \nBenefits Institution (EOBI), remain government controlled, which raises governance concerns, \nas most of the funds they are entrusted with belong to private individuals.  \n \n11.  Prevalent but Inefficient Banking System. Financial intermediation is dominated by \nthe banking system, which accounts for 61% of deposits. About 34% of deposits are with the \nNSS, and only 5% are mobilized through nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs).13 Nonperforming \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002. Country Strategy and Program 2002-2004: Pakistan. Manila. \n9  Economic Revival Plan (December 1999); Three Year Development Plan 2000-2003; Ten Year Perspective \nDevelopment Plan 2001/11; Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2000); Poverty Partnership Agreement with \nADB (2002); Budget Documents for FY2001, FY2002 and FY2003. \n10 This compares to 150% in India, 125% in Malaysia, 53% in the Philippines, and around 50% the US. It should be \nnoted that non-bank financial markets, in particular capital markets, account for a much larger share of savings in all \nof those countries compared to Pakistan. \n11 In Pakistan, M2 comprises currency in circulation and deposits with scheduled banks and SBP. The M2/GDP ratio \ncompares to 58% in India, 64% in the Philippines, and 106% in Malaysia. \n12 Allocation to the private sector hovered between 45% and 55% for most of the past decade, and the fall at the end \nof the 1990s reflects above all a fall in demand due to the generally subdued investment climate. \n13 NBFIs are defined in the context of this program as all financial institutions and intermediaries that do not fall under \nthe  SBP  banking  regulations,  including  insurance,  pension  funds,  development  finance  institutions,  leasing \ncompanies, investment banks, and other related services, but excluding microfinance. \n   ", "4  \n \nloans (NPLs) average around 24% for all banks, and more than 50% for specialized financial \ninstitutions,  including  development  finance  institutions  (DFIs).  Coupled  with  administrative \ninefficiencies, this has driven up intermediation costs and the spread between average deposit \nand lending rates is as high as 8%. The situation is generally better for foreign banks, which \ntend to be more selective in credit extension. The generally poor access, limited choice, and low \nquality of financial services and products contribute to explaining the low savings rate that has \nstagnated at around 13% of GDP.  \n \n12.  High Fragmentation and Limited Role of NBFIs. Within the financial sector, nonbank \nproducts, markets, and services remain relatively little developed and poorly capitalized. This is \ndespite the fact that there is a large number of NBFIs, including 16 investment banks, 16 DFIs \nand  specialized  finance  institution,  33  leasing  companies,  45  modarabas,14  41  investment \ncompanies and mutual funds, 420 brokers, 3 discount houses, and 58 insurance companies. \nMany of the NBFIs posses a very weak institutional base both in terms of assets as well as \nhuman resources to respond in an effective manner to the challenges of the economy. In many \ncases, their establishment was predicated on short-term returns and regulatory arbitrage rather \nthan long-term economic interest. The proliferation has created more problems than it has \nresolved, in particular by creating supervisory problems and undermining confidence in the \nsector.  To  build  up  genuine  competition,  confidence,  and  transparency  in  the  sector,  the \nGovernment seeks to promote consolidation through mergers or closures by raising the capital \nrequirements for various financial intermediaries. \n \n13.  Mixed Performance of Equity Markets. Pakistan\u2019s equity market, which is dominated \nby the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) but also includes exchanges in Lahore and Islamabad, \nhas seen some impressive growth over the past decade: The number of listed companies at the \nKSE increased to 741 at the end of FY2002 from 628 in 1992, market capitalization increased to \nmore than PRs400 billion from PRs218 billion, and annual trading rose to 68 billion shares, from \n1 billion in 1992. Much of this development \u2013 except for the increase in trading volume \u2013 took \nplace during the first half of the 1990s, and not all of this is good news. Most importantly, the \neconomic impact of the equity market, despite the developments, has been negligible. Market \ncapitalization is still only around 11% of GDP.15 Many companies sought listing primarily for tax \nadvantages without subsequent trading taking place and little interest in investor relations or \ndividend payouts. Both the issuer and investor base is very narrow, with trading being heavily \nconcentrated on a few scrips only. Trading volume relative to market capitalization is among the \nhighest in the world, reflecting a very strong speculative and short-term interest in a narrow \nmarket that makes it highly volatile. The KSE share index has hovered between 1000 and 2000 \npoints  for  most  of  the  past  decade  without  exhibiting  a  marked  trend.  Factoring  in  the \ndevaluation of the Pakistan rupee and economic uncertainties, as well as the high guaranteed \nreturns  offered  by  the  NSS,  investing  in  the  stock  market  has  not  been  a  very  attractive \nproposition.  All  this  has  deterred  long-term  and  foreign  investors,  and  valuations  of  some \neconomically sound companies are often very low.  This environment is not very attractive for \ncompanies with serious economic ambitions to raise capital from the equities market, and there \nhave been only 13 new listings on all three exchanges over the past 5 years. To counter the \ntrend, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has, since its inception in \n1999, and within the framework of the Government\u2019s first Capital Market Development Program \n(CMDP), taken credible steps to restore investor confidence. In particular, SECP has been \nimproving risk management and is vigorously enforcing compliance with rules and regulations, \n                                                 \n14 Modarabas are finance companies that operate according to Islamic principles of finance, not involving interest. \n15 This compares with 41% in India, 35% in the Philippines, 154% in Malaysia, and 270% in the US. \n ", "  5\n \nincluding delisting of defaulting companies. These measures will need to be enhanced further \nbut constitute an important basis for more sustainable market development. \n \n14.  Growing Debt Market but Narrow Range of Instruments. Pakistan\u2019s emerging debt \nmarket has gained considerable momentum over the past few years. The corporate bond market \nconsists primarily of Term Finance Certificates (TFCs) with 3-5 years maturity. The number of \nnew issues has risen constantly from the first listed issue in 1995. By the end of FY2002, 39 \nTFCs had been issued for a total volume of more than PRs22 billion, of which the largest share \nwas issued by the leasing industry. The steep rise in particular over the past 2 years was helped \nthrough the reforms promoted under the CMDP, including improved tax treatment; streamlined \nissuance process; ban on institutional investments in NSS; and introduction by the Government \nof long-term Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) in December 2000 with maturities of 3, 5, and 10 \nyears, which established a much-needed benchmark for pricing. In FY2002, the Government \ncarried out six PIB auctions and raised PRs46 billion. Most of the investors in PIBs are banks, \nwhich raises some regulatory and market concerns. The increase in primary issues has yet to \ntranslate into an active secondary market for both PIBs and TFCs, for which trading activity is \nlimited. In addition, the range of instruments is still narrow, in particular for companies. Tenors \nfor TFCs are generally not available beyond 5 years, and there is also no short-term corporate \npaper in the absence of proper guidelines and tax treatment for such.  \n \n15.  Weak Institutional Investor Base. Institutional investment is key to the development of \nmoney and capital markets. In Pakistan it is poorly developed and has not been growing \nrecently. Life insurance premium income amounts to less than 0.3% of GDP, much lower than in \nthe Philippines (0.8%), India (1.8%), Malaysia (2.1%), or the US (4.5%), and has shown little \ngrowth over the few past years, unlike in most other emerging Asian economies. Private pension \nand provident funds lack a proper regulatory framework and are offered  by only a few large \ncompanies. The largest institutional investors, SLIC and EOBI, with assets in excess of $1.2 \nbillion and $700 million, respectively, are government controlled; and the largest share of their \ninvestments is in government debt. The investment process of these institutions is not very \ntransparent. Coupled with high administrative costs, this has resulted in very poor returns. The \nmutual funds industry was unable to offer attractive alternatives and to reach out to the retail \nmarket in a significant way. There are fewer than 100,000 investors in mutual funds in Pakistan, \nwith total assets of about PRs26 billion under management, mostly with the National Investment \nTrust (NIT). This represents less than 3% of bank deposits, and compares with about 23 million \ninvestors in India with assets amounting to 12% of deposits. Under the CMDP, some progress \nhas been made with privatization of the management of the country's two largest mutual funds, \nNIT and Investment Corporation of Pakistan. Yet, lacking a wider range of instruments and \nmarket depth for portfolio diversification and management, the industry has generally focused on \nequity funds and has consequently been hampered by the inherent problems of the market. \nInternational investors showed some interest in Pakistan\u2019s capital markets during the first half of \nthe 1990s, and foreign portfolio investment peaked at about $1.3 billion in 1997. However, it has \nsince  virtually  all  but  disappeared,  despite  generally  favorable  market  valuations,  amid \ncontinued  economic  uncertainties,  concerns  about  market  governance,  and  lack  of  risk \nmanagement and hedging tools. The temporary imposition of foreign exchange controls after the \nnuclear testing in May 1998 has also badly shaken investor confidence.  \n \n16.  Comprehensive Reforms Initiated. Pakistan has since the mid-1990s embarked on \ncomprehensive  financial  sector  reforms.  Key  reforms  include  liberalization  of  the  foreign \nexchange market and interest rates; increased autonomy of the central bank and its focus on \nmonetary policy and banking supervision; establishment of an independent regulator for capital \nmarkets and NBFIs; upgrading of legal and regulatory frameworks; reduction of NPLs in the \n   ", "6  \n \nbanking  sector;  and  restructuring  of  government-owned  financial  institutions  including \nprivatization, merger, closure, and enhanced management autonomy. Yet, the reform agenda is \nfar from complete, and reforms are ongoing at various levels to further reduce the Government\u2019s \ninvolvement in financial sector operations and enhance private sector participation on market-\nbased principles. \n \n17.  CMDP  Implemented  Generally  Successfully.  A  first  phase  of  reforms  for  capital \nmarket development was implemented generally successfully over 1997-2001 under the CMDP, \nsupported by ADB.16 The reforms were carried out under a difficult macroeconomic environment \nand subdued investor and issuer interest. The main achievement under the CMDP has been the \nestablishment of an effective regulator as well as improvements in the technological market \ninfrastructure. Progress was also made in improving investor protection, governance of the stock \nexchanges, and development of the primary corporate debt market, as well improving prudential \nnorms  for  NBFIs.  The  ambitious  reforms  have  addressed  some  of  the  most  fundamental \nproblems and established a good basis for further market development. Yet, important areas \nwithin Pakistan\u2019s financial sector must be addressed further to bring about the full impact of \nthese reforms. In many ways, the achievements under the CMDP have been necessary but not \nsufficient. A project completion report detailing the accomplishments under the first CMDP was \nreleased in November 2002.17 \n \nB.  Opportunities and Issues \n \n18.  Potential for Growth and Development. Given the underdeveloped state of Pakistan\u2019s \nnonbank financial markets relative to the size of its economy as well as other emerging markets, \nand the inefficiencies and structural problems within the banking system to finance the much-\nneeded capacity expansion of the economy, there is good reason and scope for growth. Capital \nmarkets, in particular, can play an important role for sustainable investment and mobilization of \nlong-term savings. This is closely linked to the development of contractual savings through life \ninsurance and pension funds, which fulfill an important social role in old-age protection. Direct \nfinancial intermediation through markets can improve funding and investment management of \ncompanies, and thus their productivity, while offering better return for savers. Broadening of the \nfinancial system can further reduce financial sector vulnerabilities and systemic risks associated \nwith a banking crisis, the impacts of which are often most severe for the poor. Further reduction \nin government involvement in the sector would also stimulate allocation of resources according \nto market-based principles.  \n \n19.  Improving  Investor  Confidence  is  Key.  While  a  good  foundation  has  been  built \nthrough the CMDP, functioning of financial markets cannot be mandated by the Government or \nany other party. Their efficiency and effectiveness depends on building credibility with private \nsector investors and issuers, which needs to be sustained over time in a dynamic environment. \nWithin this context, strengthening investor confidence through policy consistency, a strong and \ncredible  regulator,  and  effective  dialogue  among  various  stakeholders  is  of  paramount \nimportance.  This  needs  to  be  underpinned  by  a  set  of  consistent  actions  to  strengthen \ngovernance, institutions, risk management, and operations.   \n \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 1997.

Increase  Corporate  Governance  and  Transparency.  The  development  and \nsustainability of financial markets will depend highly on the framework of corporate governance \nadopted and the degree of adherence to the framework in practice. As the market develops, it \nwill in turn play an integral role in promoting principles of good governance by enforcing financial \ndiscipline  on  companies  that  practice  poor  corporate  governance.  Poor  governance,  wide \ninformation  asymmetry,  and  lack  of  confidence  in  the  integrity  of  transactions  and  internal \ncontrol  mechanisms  are  the  biggest  investor  concerns  in  Pakistan.  Thus,  governance \nframeworks need to be improved and vigorously adhered to at various levels. This concerns \ncorporate issuers who raise funds from the market; intermediaries and related service providers \nincluding  stock  exchanges,  brokers,  and  institutional  investors;  information  providers  and \nadvisors, including accounting and auditing firms as well as rating agencies; and the regulator. \nKey  ingredients  are  adequate  information  disclosure  and  the  right  of  key  stakeholders  to \ninfluence behavior or change management according to a set of rules. \n \n21.  Building a Level Playing Field by Removing Policy Distortions. Key distortions on \nthe policy level remain, primarily with regard to tax and interest rates. There has been differential \ntax  treatment  among  financial  instruments,  which  has  worked  to  the  advantage  of  some \ninstruments  and  investors  while  discriminating  against  others.18  Moreover,  tax  rates  and \nassessment modalities have been changed frequently in the past. This has created confusion \namong investors and unintended distortions, in addition to an administrative burden in tax \nassessment and collection. Streamlining tax treatment can stimulate financial market activity. \nThis would also generate higher tax returns over the medium to long term to offset any short-\nterm adjustment cost. In addition, interest rates remain administered in an ad-hoc manner for the \nNSS, and their high level in real terms holds back the development of alternative instruments. \nGood progress in reforming the NSS was made under the CMDP by excluding institutional \ninvestments, and lowering their rates of return. However, to tap into the important retail market \nfor capital market development, NSS rates should be adjusted following a systematic market-\nbased mechanism to levels that are below a comparable benchmark for wholesale securities. \n \n22.  Streamline Policy Making, Regulation and Supervision. The integration of financial \nmarkets  witnessed  globally  has  only  been  partly  matched  with  institutional  responses  in \nPakistan. Policy making remains fragmented, involving diverse ministries, in particular with \nregards to contractual savings and institutional investments,19 which are poorly developed and \ngovernment dominated. In such an environment, policy consistency is less likely to be achieved, \nand coordination administratively more cumbersome. Similarly, there has been some degree of \noverlap between SBP and SECP on the regulation of nonbank financial products and services, \nsuch  as  leasing  or  investment  banking.  Further  clarification  and  a  strong  mandate  to  key \ninstitutions in line with international best practices are needed to provide a clear perspective to \ninvestors. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n18 For example, until FY2003 tax rates on dividend income by insurance companies were depending on ownership \nstructure and were different than for other corporate institutions; tax rates for some instruments differed for \nhouseholds or institutions, such as withholding tax for bank deposits, which was treated as a final liability for \nhouseholds, but was adjustable against final settlement for institutions; dividends were subject to double taxation if \nthe investment was made through a mutual fund or other contractual savings instruments rather than directly; and \ntax rates differed for instruments with similar characteristics, e.g. withholding tax was higher on T-bills than for NSS \nor TFCs and PIBs. Many of the inconsistencies have been removed through the Finance Ordinance, 2002. \n19 Life insurance and pension systems are under the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Labor, respectively. \n   ", "8  \n \n23.  Tap  into  Retail  Markets  through  Contractual  Savings.  Strong  intermediaries  are \nrequired to make capital markets accessible to the general public on a retail level. While the \nrange  of  investment  instruments  has  been  limited,  the  dominance  of  a  few  government-\ncontrolled institutions, in particular SLIC and NIT, and preferential treatment given to them, has \nfurther inhibited competition and innovation. The development of pension funds has been largely \nneglected,  or  has  received  bad  press  through  inefficient  operation  in  a  poorly  regulated \nenvironment. In addition, tax treatment has not been supportive; and mutual funds have, in the \nabsence of liquid debt markets, focused on volatile equity funds. Most retail markets elsewhere \nhave developed through introduction first of low-risk money market funds that can favorably \ncompete with bank deposits, and later expansion through debt funds into equity. There is a huge \npotential in Pakistan to tap into this segment, which would allow fund managers to develop a \ncritical mass needed to invest in staff and research. Equally important for the development of \nretail products is a strong and credible regulator to protect the public, as well as adequate skills \nof fund managers. The availability of the latter could particularly benefit from the introduction of \nforeign partners in the market. The mobilization of funds from the retail level, in turn, will provide \nmuch needed liquidity for the development of new instruments. Development of the retail market \nthrough  institutional  investment  is  thus  crucial  for  the  development  of  Pakistan's  financial \nmarkets.  Further  consideration  should  also  be  given  to  converting  the  NSS  into  a  funded \nscheme  and  to  lower  its  administrative  costs  while  increasing  its  operational  efficiency. \nReduction of administrative overheads, and professionalism of investment management are also \nrequired  for  the  other  large  government-controlled  intermediaries;  and  private  sector \nparticipation, subject to strict accountability, may increase efficiencies. \n \n24.  Develop Wider Range of Instruments and Deepen Markets. Institutional investors \nneed  a  wide  range  of  instruments  with  sufficient  depth  and  secondary  market  activity  to \neffectively manage their investment portfolios. The introduction of short-term commercial paper \nin  particular  could  yield  significant  benefits,  as  corporates  could  fund  their  working  capital \nrequirements and improve treasury management without being penalized for the inefficiencies of \nthe banking sector. It would also allow them to free up collateral to finance longer term capacity \nexpansion, while offering better short-term returns than currently available. Furthermore, there is \na need to deepen markets through increase in debt and equity issues as well as secondary \ntrading in more securities, to allow institutional investors to effectively manage and diversify their \ninvestment portfolios. The equities market, in particular, could both benefit from and provide a \ncredible avenue for privatization of blue-chip state-owned companies, as well as a source for \ncapital expansion by medium-sized enterprises that have not been utilized in the past. This \nneeds to be complemented through a wider range of hedging and credit enhancement tools. The \nsuccessful introduction of new issues and deepening of the market is closely linked to further \nreform of NSS rates as well as tax treatment. \n \n25.  Upgrade Market Structure and Infrastructure. Few areas are more affected by the \nrapid  advancements  in  information  technology  than  financial  markets.  While  a  good \ntechnological  base  has  been  established  under  the  CMDP  with  automation  of  trading  and \ncreation of central securities deposit, clearing, and settlement systems, the development of \nInternet-based  technology  in  particular  has  created  new  opportunities  and  challenges  to \nincrease the access to capital markets by retail investors. Further systems are needed to \naccommodate new instruments and market segments. This requires institutional responses by \nthe  stock  exchanges,  in  particular.  There  is  increasing  competition  and  integration  among \ninternational exchanges, and Pakistan must respond to those trends to offer an attractive and \ncompetitive  market-place.  Integration  of  the  domestic  exchanges  into  a  national  market, \ndemutualization of exchanges, as well as introduction of new over-the-counter market segments \nwill be required. \n ", "  9\n \n \n26.  Improve  Risk  Management  and  Enforcement.  The  increasing  sophistication  of \nfinancial markets carries high inherent risks that must be adequately addressed. There is an \nincreasing awareness internationally that concept of self-regulation need to be complemented \nthrough  strong  regulatory  regimes  and  credible  enforcement  as  well  as  adequate  risk \nmanagement systems and tools. This must also include mechanisms of investor compensation \nand market stabilization during times of stress on markets. \n \n27.  Improve Efficiency of Related Financial Products and Services. An effective and \nresilient financial sector requires a range of services for risk management and outreach to \ndiverse client needs. A strong insurance sector in particular complements financial markets by \nmitigating risks that could undermine the economic system. The development and efficiency of \nthe insurance industry are closely linked to the functioning of financial markets, in turn playing a \nmajor role in developing financial markets and governance through institutional investment. \nThese aspects have not yet been sufficiently developed in Pakistan, and a large portion of the \ninsurance market remains under direct government control. Likewise, most of the specialized \nDFIs remain under government control. They have in the past generally failed to efficiently \nchannel long-term funds into productive investments. The Government has embarked on an \nambitious program for further consolidation and restructuring of DFIs.  This is a costly exercise \nwith  significant  fiscal  implications  that  requires  the  assistance  of  international  financing \ninstitutions, but further privatization or consolidation will shift incentive structures that are likely \nto result in greater product innovation and support for market-determined financing mechanisms. \nThere is also considerable scope to increase the efficiency of other  NBFIs, in particular to \nprovide  longer  term  finance,  including  the  leasing  industry,  through  mergers  and  better \ncapitalization. \n \n28.  Upgrade Skills. Modern financial systems require adequate skills and capacity to deal \nwith increasingly complex issues at various levels. Pakistan has a good but very small skills \nbase that must be enhanced and broadened considerably, covering both the private and public \nsector. Externally funded capacity-building measures will be required to address the most urgent \nneeds, but must be complemented by internally generated mechanisms to raise professional \nstandards  in  a  sustainable  manner.  This  should  entail  the  development  of  standards  and \ncurricula at the international level applicable to the Pakistan context, and professional training \ninstitutes set up with the private sector to offer options for sustainable skills development. \n \n29.  Dealing with External Challenges. Pakistan\u2019s financial sector is facing international as \nwell  as  religious  trends,  in  particular  with  respect  to  its  membership  in  the  World  Trade \nOrganization (WTO) and the decision of the Supreme Court on Islamization of the economy and \nfinancial system. In addition, the events following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 in \nthe  US  have  long-lasting  implications  for  Pakistan\u2019s  financial  sector.  The  Government  is \nresponding  to  these  challenges  in  a  flexible  and  pragmatic  manner.  As  a  WTO  member, \nPakistan welcomes participation of qualified international investors and service providers to \nstrengthen its financial sector. There remain only a few restrictions, primarily in the insurance \nsector. In response to the Supreme Court decision to put in place a financial system based on \nIslamic principles, the Government is working on a credible proposal that would allow a dual \nsystem as practiced, e.g., in Malaysia, with encouragement to financial institutions to develop \nIslamic  financial  products.  The  development  of  equity  and  other  asset-based  markets  in \nparticular would be in line with this. The events of 11 September impact primarily the general \ninsurance industry, as terrorism-related cover is no longer available in the market. This, if \nunaddressed,  will  put  pressure  on  the  financial  viability  of  projects,  financing  costs  of \ncompanies, and ultimately financiers. It will also risk the sustainability of public finances, as the \n   ", "10  \nGovernment will be exposed to large losses from public sector properties and companies that \nremain uninsured, including potential liabilities by Pakistan International Airlines. In addition, \ntighter control and scrutiny of international capital flows can be expected. \n \n30.  A more detailed analysis of the key sector issues and opportunities is in Appendix 1. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \n31.  Following  successful  implementation  of  the  CMDP,  the  Government  sought  ADB\u2019s \ncontinued support for its financial markets development agenda. Support for financial (nonbank) \nmarkets also forms part of the ADB\u2019s financial sector strategy for Pakistan and was included in \nthe CSP for 2002.20 Program formulation was closely coordinated with various stakeholders, \nincluding the private sector and other developments partners. An overview of processing steps, \napproaches,  and  background  studies  undertaken  is  provided  in  Appendix  2.  Summary \ninformation on external assistance to the sector is presented in Appendix 3. The program \nframework is in Appendix 4. The agreements on the FMG Program loan are reflected in the \nGovernment\u2019s development policy letter and the attached policy matrix in Appendix 5.  \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n32.  The overall goal of the Program is to facilitate private sector-led productivity growth as \nwell as social protection. It thus aims to contribute to poverty reduction indirectly. This is to be \nachieved by improving the framework for mobilization of long-term resources for saving and \ninvestment through market-based financial instruments and institutions. The Program also aims \nto increase resilience against financial sector crisis and mitigate its negative implications for the \npoor.  \n \n33.  The purpose of the Program is to support the Government\u2019s financial sector reform \nagenda, and development of capital markets and other nonbank financial services in particular. \nThe immediate objectives of the Program are to (i) strengthen investor confidence through \nimproved governance, transparency, and investor protection; (ii) increase the depth and diversity \nof financial intermediation through new capital market issues for saving and investment; (iii) \nimprove  the  operational  efficiency  and  risk  management  of  intermediaries;  and  (iv)  reduce \nfinancial sector vulnerabilities.   \n \n34.  These objectives will be achieved through a mix of reforms on various levels, including \npolicy, governance, institutions, and operations. From a market perspective, the Program will \ncover equity markets, debt and money markets, contractual savings, and other NBFIs and \nservices, including insurance, leasing, and DFI reform.  \n \n35.  The policy reform agenda, to be financed through a program loan, is supported by two \nTA loans: one for strengthening of pension, insurance, and savings systems; and one for \nstrengthening  regulation,  enforcement,  and  governance  of  nonbank  financial  markets.  The \nProgram  is  complemented  further  through  nonlending  initiatives  including  ADB\u2019s  guarantee \nproducts to enhance integration of Pakistan\u2019s financial markets with international capital flows; \nand to ensure continued access to cover for selected noncommercial risks that was withdrawn \nby the international insurance industry following the terrorist events in the US on 11 September \n2001. \n                                                 \n20 The Program was originally listed as Capital Markets Development Program II, but the title was subsequently \nchanged to better reflect the contents of the Program. \n ", "  11\n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n \n36.  Much of the basic regulatory and technological infrastructure has been put in place for \ncapital market development, and the key challenge now is to get investment going. This requires \nabove all promoting new capital market issues and developing institutional investment, which is \nclosely linked to improvements in corporate governance of both financial intermediaries and \ncorporate issuers. Improvements in corporate governance, in turn, are often brought about by \ninstitutional  investors.  The  approach  suggested  under  the  Program  is  to  break  this  nexus \nthrough simultaneous reforms that introduce instruments with lower risk to provide a wider \nchoice of liquid investment alternatives to investors, vigorously improve and enforce corporate \ngovernance  and  risk  management  standards  to  increase  investor  confidence,  introduce \nmeasures that encourage private sector participation in institutional investment, and upgrade \nskills  at  various  levels.  In  addition,  complementary  financial  products  and  services  will  be \npromoted for broadening and sustaining the financial sector base. \n \n37.  The reform agenda is structured around five components: (i) improvement of the fiscal, \ninterest rate and investment policy environment; (ii) increase in investor confidence through \nimprovement of governance, transparency, and investor protection; (iii) increase in supply of \nfinancial instruments and improvements in market infrastructure; (iv) increase in demand for \nfinancial instruments through development of contractual savings and institutional investment; \nand (v) development of related financial services and institutions.  \n \n38.  In line with ADB\u2019s evaluation findings on policy reform design of past program loans and \nrevised policies on program lending,21 conditions have been formulated with increased focus on \noutcomes to allow for greater flexibility in actions to achieve compliance. Details on specific \nactions under the Program are in the policy matrix in Appendix 5.  \n \n1.  Improvement of Fiscal, Interest Rate, and Investment Policy Environment \n \n39.  Reforms under this component will improve the fiscal policy environment to promote and \nencourage long-term saving and investment in financial markets, as well as further reform the \nNSS. Specific actions will rationalize tax treatment for financial instruments and investors, and \nprovide  selective  incentives  to  stimulate  long-term  savings  and  nonspeculative  equity \ninvestment. Distortions in foreign exchange transfer for reinsurance and of investment criteria for \nsecurities to qualify as statutory liquidity requirements are also being removed. In addition, a \nmore systematic mechanism for linking interest rates for the NSS to market-based benchmarks \nis being introduced. NSS reforms are in particular required to further adjust the yield for short-\nterm holding periods to comparable market rates for retail securities. For the medium term, \nconsideration will be given to further lowering stamp duties and converting the NSS gradually \nfrom an unfunded into a funded scheme with investments in government securities and rated \ncorporate debt, and to promote long-term capital formation through selected fiscal incentives. \nPolicy measures under component 1 of the Program are summarized in Table 1. \nTable 1: Policy measures to improve fiscal, interest rate, and investment policy environment \n1st Tranche Release Action  2nd Tranche Release Action \n(1) Rationalize tax treatment for financial  (1) Further rationalization of tax treatment for \ninstruments and investors.  financial instruments. \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 1999.

Reforms to improve investor confidence seek to raise governance standards, and to \nimprove transparency in information disclosure and enforcement for investor protection. Those \nreforms will be spearheaded by SECP. Important measures that have already been taken over \nthe past year include the streamlining and clarification of responsibilities for policy formulation \nand regulation within the government as well as further improvements in the mandate and \ngovernance structure of SECP for broad-based regulation of financial markets and services. \nThis should allow SECP to develop into a full-fledged financial services regulator following best \npractices recently applied elsewhere and taking account of the increasing integration of financial \nmarkets and products. A corporate governance code based on wider stakeholder consultation \nhas been introduced and will be vigorously enforced, to cover the corporate sector, financial \nintermediaries, and related professions. The Companies Ordinance is being updated to provide \nlegal  cover  for  some  of  the  provisions.  In  addition,  laws  and  regulations  for  enhanced \ntransparency  in  financial  transactions  and  corporate  affairs  will  be  introduced,  including \nlegislation to combat money laundering and regulate corporate insolvencies. Brokers will be \nrequired to strictly separate proprietary trading from investor accounts. Standards for information \nproviders and accounting and auditing firms as well as information disclosure will be improved. \nThe stock exchanges will improve their governance structure and risk management systems, \nand the board of KSE has already been reorganized to allow enhanced representation by \nnonmember  directors.  A  national  exchange  for  financial  instruments  is  envisaged  with  a \ncorporate structure, possibly through integration of the existing exchanges or otherwise. Policy \nmeasures under component 2 of the Program are summarized in Table 2. \nTable 2: Policy measures to increase investor confidence through improvement  \nin  governance, transparency, and investor protection \n1st Tranche Release Action  2nd Tranche Release Action \n(6) Clarify and strengthen coordination for financial  (4) Improve the legal framework for transparency in \nsector policy formulation and regulation.  financial transactions and corporate affairs. \n(7) Enhance mandate and governance structures of  (5) Enhance SECP capacity for market \nSECP.  surveillance, and for regulation and supervision of \nNBFIs. \n(8) Improve corporate governance standards.

Increase in Supply of Financial Instruments and Improvements in Market \nInfrastructure \n \n41.  This component seeks to facilitate new capital market issues and introduce new financial \ninstruments. Reforms will be initiated primarily by SECP together with the stock exchanges, and \nsupported by SBP as far as government bonds and money markets are concerned. A second \nboard and/or new over-the-counter (i.e., quote-driven) market for equities is being created to \nfacilitate equity issues by new or smaller companies with good growth potential.  To increase the \nsupply  of  equities,  the  government  will  make  use  of  the  stock  market  to  implement  its \nprivatization program, in particular for blue chip companies. The use of electronic trading will be \nfacilitated through adequate technology platforms. New risk management instruments are being \nintroduced to facilitate forward cover and hedging. Equity futures have already been introduced, \nand  concept  papers  for  the  development  of  interest  rate  swaps  and  new  money  market \ninstruments  are  being  initiated.  Regulations  and  procedures  will  be  developed  to  facilitate \nissuance and trading of commercial paper by rated companies and corporate bodies. Clearing \nand settlement systems will be upgraded further in particular to facilitate further secondary \ntrading in debt instruments, and a system of market making for corporate debt will be introduced. \nPolicy measures under component 3 of the Program are summarized in Table 3. \nTable 3: Policy measures to increase supply of financial instruments and improve market \ninfrastructure \n1st Tranche Release Action  2nd Tranche Release Action \n(13) Introduce new markets for smaller and less  (11) Improve the supply of equity issues through \nfrequently traded companies.  privatization. \n(14) Introduce financial hedging instruments and  (12) Improve secondary debt market activity. \nmarkets. \n(15) Initiate development of a money market for  (13) Further develop money markets. \ncommercial paper. \n(16) Promote the bond market (PIBs and TFCs).   \n \n4.  Increase in Demand for Financial Instruments through Development of \nContractual Savings and Institutional Investment \n \n42.  Improvements in the policy, governance, and supply side (under components 1\u20133) will \nprovide the basic foundation for further growth of institutional investment. To build on this, \ninstitutional changes including increased private sector participation will be introduced in the \nlargest  government-owned  institutional  investors  to  ensure  better  alignment  between  the \ninterests of management and investors and savers. This will include measures to improve asset \nmanagement and better outreach and provision of services, in particular for pensions and life \ninsurance. A regulatory framework will be introduced to improve minimum standards for pension \nfunds. Mutual funds for the money and debt markets will be encouraged to tap into retail \ninvestment.  At the same time, institutional investors that raise funds from the general public will \nbe  subjected  to  stricter  governance  standards  and  information  disclosure.  Professional \n   ", "14  \nstandards will be introduced for fund managers and investment analysts. As the build-up of \ndomestic institutional investment will require some time, foreign portfolio investment will be \nactively encouraged and may be supported through guarantee arrangements to address country \nrisk  issues.  Foreign  portfolio  inflow  through  proper  institutional  channels  will  also  transfer \nexpertise into the domestic market. Policy measures under component 4 of the Program are \nsummarized in Table 4. \nTable 4: Policy measures to increase demand for financial instruments through  \ndevelopment of contractual savings and institutional investment  \n1st Tranche Release Action  2nd Tranche Release Action \n(17) Upgrade regulation for mutual funds.   \n(18) Clarify and streamline regulatory  (14) Promote private pensions. \nresponsibilities for pensions. \n(19) Liberalize investment restrictions for  (15) Improve the operational efficiency of large \ninstitutional investors.  government-controlled institutional investors (SLIC, \nEOBI). \n \n5.  Development of Related Financial Services and Institutions \n \n43.  Improvements in the regulatory framework will raise the standards of financial soundness \nfor NBFIs, and encourage consolidation of the highly fragmented sector. Improvements in the \nregulatory framework will also further encourage the development of mortgage-backed markets \nfor housing finance and asset securitization, in particular by the leasing industry.  Recently, the \nGovernment has allowed tax deductibility of mergers and carry forward of losses for merged \nentities to encourage merger and restructuring of financial institutions. The Government has also \nreduced the number of government-owned DFIs through liquidation or merger. The restructuring \nof the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) is currently at an advanced stage. The \nProgram will support the cost of restructuring IDBP for sale to the private sector or for liquidation \nin case no buyer can be found. Reforms have also been initiated in the insurance sector, \nincluding improved governance of state-owned insurance companies, reduction of the monopoly \nof state-owned companies, for public sector properties and activities, greater private sector \nparticipation for reinsurance, and improved retention capacity for selected noncommercial risks \nthat are no longer covered by the market. Policy measures under component 5 of the Program \nare summarized in Table 5. \nTable 5: Policy measures to develop related financial services and institutions \n1st Tranche Release Action  2nd Tranche Release Action \n(20) Promote corporate and financial sector  (16) Strengthen the regulatory framework and \nrestructuring and consolidation.  supervision for NBFIs. \n(21) Reduce government dominance and  (17) Sell IDBP to the private sector or liquidate it if \nconsolidate DFIs through sale or mergers  no buyer can be found. \n(22) Improve governance of government-controlled  (18) Reduce public sector involvement in \ninsurance companies.  commercial insurance operations. \n(23) Open the general insurance market (for public   \nsector property and activities). \n(24) Enhance risk retention capacity for   \nnoncommercial risks and strengthen reinsurance. \n ", "  15\nC.  Important Features \n \n44.  An important and innovative feature of the Program is that it builds on ADB\u2019s unique \ncapacity  among  multilateral  financing  institutions  to  combine  public  and  private  sector \ninstruments  and  integrate  nonlending  assistance  to  leverage  the  policy  reform  agenda.  In \nparticular, the Program seeks to leverage private sector investment directly into the development \nprocess and establish a genuine public-private partnership, in addition to the traditional public \nsector  lending,  which  seeks  to  finance  the  cost  of  adjustment.  Through  the  innovative \napplication of its PRG instrument, ADB will augment and sustain private sector resource flows \ninto the economy. Two PRG Facilities (see paras. 63-68) will support risk mitigation to enhance \nPakistan\u2019s  access  to  international  capital  flows  and  integration  with  international  financial \nmarkets, and to ensure access to comprehensive insurance for soundness of investment and \nfinancial  markets.  Within  this  context,  the  Program  will  also  respond  to  the  Government\u2019s \ninitiatives in dealing with the consequences on the insurance industry of the terrorist attacks in \nthe  US  on  11  September  2001,  after  which  cover  for  selected  violence-related  risk  was \nwithdrawn. \n \n45.  The implementation of those nonlending components requires special arrangements with \nthe private sector that are separate from the arrangements for implementation of the Program \nand TA loans. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n46.  The Government has requested a loan of $260 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Program.  The loan will be provided to support the FMG Program, \nas described in the development policy letter and the attached policy matrix (Appendix 5). The \nloan amount was determined on the basis of the cost and strength of the structural reforms as \nwell as the strategic significance of the sector. The costs of structural adjustment are estimated \nto be about $939 million equivalent, consisting of the following main components: \n \n(i)  revenue shortfall due to harmonization of tax structure, selected tax incentives,  \nand adjustment in interest rate structures ($592 million); \n(ii)  restructuring and development of government-owned institutions, including IDBP, \nSLIC, NIC, EOBI, and Central Directorate of National Savings ($316 million); \n(iii)  support to a guarantee mechanism to cover terrorism-related risks ($18 million); \nand \n(iv)  development and operation of regulatory and enforcement infrastructure ($13 \nmillion). \n \nCosting details and underlying assumptions are in Appendix 6. \n \n47.   The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0% (the fee will be \ncapitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n   ", "16  \n48.  Interest rate and currency conversion options may be exercised in accordance with the \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nConversion Guidelines. \n \n49.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  available  for  withdrawal  in  tranches  upon  satisfactory \ncompliance  with  an  agreed  upon  number  of  eligible  conditions  from  the  date  of  loan \neffectiveness up to the loan closing date, which is 31 December 2005 (paras. 55-56). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n50.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for the FMG Program, and \nSECP will be the implementing agency. Both MOF and SECP have considerable experience \nwith  the  implementation  of  comprehensive  adjustment  programs  and  have  a  number  of \ncompetent staff, many of whom where recruited from the private sector or international financial \ninstitutions at market-based salaries. SECP has also been the beneficiary of earlier institutional \nstrengthening TA by ADB and has demonstrated strong performance in implementation. \n \n51.  MOF will facilitate overall implementation of the FMG Program, administer the utilization \nof loan proceeds, and ensure compliance with all policy-related conditions. SECP will have full \nresponsibility for implementation of all conditions and program components within its regulatory \nand development mandate. MOF and SECP will ensure effective coordination through existing \nmechanisms with other concerned agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of \nLabor,  Privatization  Commission,  SBP,  and  the  private  sector  as  appropriate.    SECP  will \nfacilitate  wide  stakeholder  consultation  and  update  the  public  on  implementation  progress \nthrough an electronic homepage for the Program within SECP\u2019s website.22 \n \n2.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n52.  The proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs, \nexcluding local duties and taxes, of eligible imports.23  A list of ineligible items is in Appendix 7. \nAll procurement under the program loan will be undertaken through normal commercial practices \nfor the private sector or the Government\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures acceptable to \nADB, with due consideration to economy and efficiency.  \n \n53.  Disbursements  under  the  program  loan  will  be  made  in  line  with  ADB\u2018s  simplified \ndisbursement procedures and audit requirements.24 To withdraw the proceeds of the loan, the \nBorrower will certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected \ndisbursements under the program loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use \nof loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n3.  Counterpart Funds \n54.  The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will be used to finance \nthe cost of structural adjustment, including the establishment of funds and facilities under the \n                                                 \n22 http://www.secp.gov.pk \n23 Eligible imports refer to total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, noneligible imports specified in the \nlist of ineligible items, and imports already financed by ADB or other international and bilateral development \nagencies.  \n24 ADB. 1998.

The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  three  installments  based  on  performance  in  meeting \nspecified tranche release conditions. The first tranche, equivalent to $100 million, will become \navailable after loan effectiveness following compliance with the conditions specified in the policy \nmatrix (Appendix 5). The second tranche will be released upon satisfactory compliance with 18 \nspecified conditions, as well as continued compliance with all previous tranche conditions. The \nconditions focus on outcomes rather than inputs, in line with the finding of the policy review for \nprogram lending.25 Specific actions to measure and assess compliance with the conditions will \nbe detailed in the Program Administration Memorandum. Continued dialogue between ADB staff \nand  the  Government  throughout  program  implementation  will  be  required  to  achieve  the \noutcomes. To provide an incentive for early compliance, an incentive release under the second \ntranche amounting to $80 million can be made as soon as any 9 of the release conditions have \nbeen met, expected in November 2003. The final release of the second tranche of $80  million \nwill  take  place  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  the  remaining  conditions,  expected  in \nNovember 2004. \n \n56.  Eligible second tranche release conditions are given in the tables 1-5 between paras. 39 \nand 44.  \n \n57.  To  monitor  implementation  of  the  FMG  Program,  the  Government  will  prepare  for \nsubmission  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  as  well  as  an  annual  report  on  program \nimplementation. SECP will also regularly update the FMG Program website for transparency in \nimplementation  and  information  of  the  public.  ADB  will  send  regular  review  missions  and \nconduct, jointly with the Government, at least semiannual reviews to evaluate compliance with \nthe conditions and advise the Government on actions required to keep program implementation \non course. \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOANS \n \n58.  To augment impact, capacity for implementation and sustainability of the reform agenda, \ntwo TAs are proposed for (i) strengthening pension, insurance, and savings systems (TA1); and \n(ii) strengthening regulation, enforcement, and governance of nonbank financial markets (TA2).  \n \n59.  TA1 seeks to strengthen policy frameworks for pensions as well as the institutional \ncapacity of key government institutions involved in the management of pensions, insurance, and \nsavings. It will comprise five components: (i) establishment of an overall framework for pension \nprovision, (ii) financial assessment of civil and military pension schemes, (iii) institutional reform \nand strengthening of EOBI, (iv) capacity building for investment management in SLIC, and (v) \ninstitutional reform and strengthening of the Central Directorate of National Savings. The TA will \nbe executed by MOF, and implemented in coordination with other ministries and agencies \nincluding the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Labor. The cost of TA1 is estimated to be \n$4.5 million equivalent, comprising foreign exchange of about $2.4 million and local currency \ncosts of about $2.1 million equivalent. \n \n \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 1999.

TA2  aims  at  strengthening  standards  and  enforcement  capacity  for  corporate \ngovernance,  transparency  in  information  disclosure,  and  sustainable  risk  management  to \nimprove protection of investors and policyholders. It will also seek to enhance the skills of \nvarious market participants to deal with a more sophisticated financial system, and will raise \nethical standards in the market. The TA will comprise four components: (i) further improvement \nof legal and regulatory frameworks; (ii) capacity building of SECP with particular attention to its \nenlarged mandate for regulation and supervision of NBFIs, insurance, and pensions; (iii) support \nfor restructuring of stock exchanges; and (iv) establishment of sustainable mechanisms for skills \ndevelopment and training. It will be implemented by SECP. The cost of TA2 is estimated to be \n$4.4  million  equivalent,  comprising  foreign  exchange  costs  of  about  $2.4  million  and  local \ncurrency costs of about $2.0 million equivalent.  \n \n61.  The Government has requested two loans of $3 million equivalent each from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to help finance TA1 and TA2.  Each loan will have a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the Loan \nAgreements. \n \n62.  Details  of  the  objectives,  scope,  costs,  and  financing  as  well  as  implementation \narrangements are provided in Appendix 8 for TA1, and Appendix 9 for TA2. \n \n \nVI.  NONLENDING ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Political Risk Guarantee Facility for Enhancing Pakistan\u2019s Integration with \nInternational Capital Markets  \n \n63.  To promote institutional investment in Pakistan\u2019s capital market and integration with \ninternational financial markets, ADB will provide a facility that will issue PRGs to international \ninvestors. The PRG will guarantee payment of proceeds from eligible debt instruments if that \npayment is not made as a result of a guaranteed risk, including primarily restriction on foreign \nexchange convertibility and transferability blockage relating to repatriation of foreign exchange \nor related risks. The PRG facility will, however, not cover any risks that affect the market value of \nthe  investment  itself.  The  PRGs  issued  under  the  facility  will  be  counterguaranteed  and \nindemnified by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The maximum aggregate liability under the \nPRG facility covered by ADB at any time will not exceed $25 million equivalent, but the PRG \nfacility  may  be  enhanced  through  coguarantee  arrangements  with  the  private  sector.  It  is \nenvisaged to leverage the ADB investment through comfort offered under ADB\u2019s coguarantee \nprogram by $125 million, or a factor of up to 5 times, for a total volume of about $150 million. \nThe counterguarantee would cover only a partial amount of this, but in any case will cover the \naggregate ADB liability.  \n \n64.  The PRG may be administered on behalf of ADB through a facility agent selected from \nthe private sector according to normal commercial procedures. For each PRG issued, ADB will \ncharge the beneficiary a one-time front-end fee of up to 1%, in line with the provisions in ADB\u2019s \npolicy on guarantee operations,26 payable on the nominal amount of the guarantee limit. ADB \nwill  also  charge  a  PRG  fee  of  0.40%  per  annum  on  the  aggregate  value  of  all  liabilities \noutstanding under the PRG, calculated on a daily basis. Each beneficiary of a guarantee will pay \na fee as a percent per annum of the guaranteed amount for each investment guaranteed, which \nwill  be  determined  through  discussion  with  the  potential  facility  agents  prior  to  the  PRG \nbecoming available.

Political Risk Guarantee Facility for Enhancing Access to Cover for Selected \nViolence-Related Risks  \n \n66.  To ensure the availability of insurance cover for violence-related risks, including terrorism \ncover, which is no longer readily available in the commercial market following the terrorist \nattacks in the US on 11 September 2001 \u2013 and thus to protect economic and financial sector \nsoundness 2001 \u2013 ADB will provide a facility that will issue PRGs to investors with operations in \nPakistan or their lenders. Under the PRG facility, ADB will guarantee payment of a certain \namount to a guaranteed party in case terrorism or other political violence risk as specified under \nthe PRG policy occurs. The PRG facility will be counterguaranteed and indemnified by the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan. The maximum aggregate liability under the PRG covered by ADB \nat any time will not exceed $175 million equivalent, but the PRG facility may be enhanced \nthrough coguarantee and commercial reinsurance arrangements. \n \n67.  The  facility  will  be  administered  on  behalf  of  ADB  through  an  agent  with  sound \nunderstanding of the international insurance market, selected from the private sector according \nnormal commercial procedures. ADB will charge the beneficiary for each PRG issued a one-time \nfront-end fee of up to 1%, in line with the provisions in ADB\u2019s policy on guarantee operations, \npayable on the nominal amount of the guarantee limit. ADB will also charge a PRG fee of 0.40% \nper annum on the aggregate value of all liabilities outstanding under the PRG, calculated on a \ndaily basis. Each beneficiary of a guarantee will pay a fee as a percent per annum of the \nguaranteed amount for each policy guaranteed, which will be determined through discussion \nwith the facility agent and beneficiaries prior to the PRG becoming available. The fee may be \nchanged from time to time in light of market conditions and risk assessment. Any establishment \ncost, including agreed upon legal and out-of-pocket expenses for external parties, may be \nfinanced through deduction from the FMG Program loan amount and be recovered from the fee \nincome generated by the PRG over time. Any surplus generated by the PRG, after deduction of \nall expenses for establishment and operation, will be capitalized to build up a claims reserve or \notherwise utilized as agreed upon between ADB and the Government. \n \n68.  Details on objectives, terms, conditions and the proposed implementation mechanism for \nthe PRG are presented in Appendix 11. \n \nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n  1.  Program Benefits \n \n69.  The  overall  outcome  of  the  Program  will  be  a  vibrant,  diversified,  efficient,  and \nsustainable financial market offering a wide range of nonbank products and instruments for \nsaving and investment in a well-regulated sector environment. This will contribute to productivity \ngrowth, employment generation, and strengthening of social safety nets, as well as fiscal and \nfinancial sector stability. \n   ", "20  \n \n70.  Specifically, the following benefits will accrue: (i) improved resource mobilization and \naccess to financing of economic expansion from domestic and foreign sources; (ii) wider choice \nof funding and saving instruments accessible to the corporate sector and general public, at more \ncompetitive pricing that does not penalize for inefficiencies in the banking sector;  (iii) greater \nflexibility and improved risk management for institutional investors; (iv) increased investment \nskills and better advisory services to benefit the general public; (v) increased transparency, \ninformation disclosure, and investor protection; (vi) diversification and deepening of the financial \nsector, with less reliance on the banking sector, reducing vulnerability to financial sector crisis, \nwhich often has its most severe impact on the poor; (vii) enhanced social protection through \nwider range of insurance and old-age protection products, with greater client orientation and \noutreach including to the poor on a sustainable basis; and (viii) improved public finances through \nincreased  tax  revenue  in  the  medium  to  long  term  as  a  result  of  increased  saving  and \ninvestment, as well as a defined mechanism to deal with selected violence-related risks that can \nno longer be covered commercially. \n \n  2.  Social and Environmental Impact \n \n71.  The impact of the FMG Program will be pro-poor in supporting the three components of \nADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor sustainable economic growth, good governance, and \nsocial  development.    Pro-poor  sustainable  economic  growth  will  be  supported  through \nproductivity  improvements  as  a  result  of  the  Program\u2019s  focus  on  more  efficient  resource \nallocation  to  finance  employment-generating  activities.  Good  governance  will  be  supported \nthrough measures to improve transparency and accountability of corporate issuers, financial \nintermediaries,  information  providers,  and  regulators.  The  introduction  of  a  corporate \ngovernance  code  and  legislative  amendments  will  provide  better  protection  to  minority \nshareholders and investors, and will ensure that economic decisions will be taken in the interest \nof a larger group of stakeholders rather than a select few insiders. The Program will also support \nthe poverty reduction strategy\u2019s third pillar of social development by improving access and \nsustainability of social insurance, including pensions and life insurance. In addition, increased \nfinancial intermediation activity will result in higher tax revenues in the medium-to-long term, \nwhich can support social sector and development spending. Well-developed capital markets \nalso  provide  an  avenue  for  mobilization  of  domestic  resources  for  infrastructure  financing, \nincluding for basic infrastructure required by the poor such as water supply, energy, or transport. \nIn addition, the diversification of funding sources and diminished reliance on the banking sector \nwill reduce vulnerability to financial sector crisis, which typically carries a high fiscal cost with \nnegative implications for the poor. The support for the establishment of an explicit reinsurance \nmechanism for selected violence-related risks, which is no longer available commercially, will \nalso reduce the Government\u2019s fiscal exposure to unforeseen events that could cause fiscal \ndisruption.  The  restructuring  of  state-owned  institutions  under  the  Program  may  result  in \nreduction of employment by less than 1,000. This will be achieved largely through natural \nattrition, or by voluntary retirement schemes that provide adequate compensation well in excess \nof the minimum legal requirements. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy and \npoverty impact assessment of the Program is in Appendix 12.  \n \n72.  The Program will have no direct environmental impact, and thus no mitigating measures \nwill be required. In the long term, the benefits may be positive, as an increase in economic \nstandards  is  generally  accompanied  by  improvements  in  environmental  standards.  In  the \nmedium term, increased economic activity may result in increased environmental pressures, \nwhich will need to be addressed through general safeguards beyond the FMG Program. \n \n \n ", "  21\nB.  Risks \n \n73.  The success and impact of the program will depend on a number of key assumptions. \nThe assumptions are subject to variable degrees of risk, for which mitigating measures have \nbeen put in place as appropriate. \n \n74.  Macroeconomic Stability and Investor Perceptions. The Government has managed \nto stabilize the economy, and the outlook is positive. The agreements with IMF and successful \nrescheduling  of  official  debt  have  provided  a  good  development  framework.  However,  the \neconomy remains vulnerable to external risks such as regional conflict or civil unrest, and to the \nperception of international investors concerning such. The measures under the Program are \ndirected to improve investor confidence through improved governance standards. To lower the \nrisk perceptions of international investors, ADB will also provide guarantees that will support \nincreased cross-border transfer of funds for investment. A worsening global outlook will, as \nelsewhere, affect the performance of Pakistan's financial markets, but reform measures under \nthe  FMG  Program  are  expected  to  lessen  the  impact  of  external  shocks  and  strengthen \nresilience of the domestic system. \n \n75.  Policy Consistency and Reform Commitment. The elections in October 2002 have \ngiven a popular mandate for continuation of the reform process. In addition, implementation of \nthe reform agenda will to a large extent rely on the private sector, which strongly supports and \nhas  been  involved  in  formulation  of  the  Program.  Wide  stakeholder  consultation  during \nprocessing  sought  to  ensure  awareness  and  broad-based  ownership  for  the  reforms.  This \nmakes the program less vulnerable to changes in government and policies. Furthermore, in \nSeptember 2002 SBP was made a constitutional body with independence for monetary policies \nand shielded from government interference. \n \n76.  Short-Term Adjustment Costs. These may cause fiscal disruption. The adjustment \ncosts under the program have been reflected in the budget and revenue targets agreed upon \nwith  IMF  under  the  PRGF.  Conservative  collection  targets  for  tax  revenues  from  financial \ninstruments have been applied, and incentives for tax benefits have been capped. \n \n77.  Political Interference into Regulatory Matters. The regulator has been given a solid \ngovernance framework with strong legal protection from direct government interference.  \n \n78.  Capacity  and  Integrity  of  the  Regulator.  TA  support  will  be  provided  under  the \nProgram to further upgrade skills; financial autonomy allows the regulator to attract and retain \ncompetent staff.  \n \n79.  Inadequate Implementation of Governance and Risk Management and Standards \ndue to Vested Interest.  The regulator has in the past shown a very strong track record in \ntaking  tough  decisions  against  vested  interests  and  in  favor  of  minority  investors,  and  is \nequipped with strong regulatory powers to allow it to take appropriate action.  The private sector \nand a wide range of stakeholders will be involved in program implementation and monitoring to \nlessen dependence on a single lobbying group. The establishment of a private sector-driven \ncorporate governance center will raise governance standards and awareness. \n \n80.  Slow  Progress  in  Reforming  Key  Institutions,  including  EOBI  and  SLIC.  The \nGovernment has installed professional management in key institutions. Further measures to \nimprove governance and reduce direct government interference are being promoted under the \nProgram. Support to proreform forces and ongoing policy dialogue will also be provided under \nthe proposed TA. \n   ", "22  \nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n81.  The  Government  and  SBP  have  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the \nstandard assurances, required for successful implementation of the Project,  which have been \nincorporated in the FMG loan documents: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  maintain  a  conducive  macroeconomic  environment  for \nfinancial market development.  \n(ii)  The  Government  will  maintain  its  commitment  to  the  principles  of  good \ngovernance of the financial sector and not impose any laws, rules, regulations, or \nadministrative measures that undermine the autonomy and effectiveness of the \nregulator and its capacity to attract, retain, and develop qualified staff. \n(iii)  The  Government  will  ensure  continuation  of  the  policy  measures  taken  in \ncoordination with ADB and IMF beyond the Program period. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n82.  The following conditions for loan effectiveness have been incorporated into the loan \nagreements: \n \n(i)  For each one of the three loans under the Program (the FMG program loan, the \nTA  loan  for  Strengthening  of  Regulation,  Enforcement  and  Governance  of \nFinancial Markets, and the TA loan for Strengthening of Pension, Insurance and \nSavings  Systems):    that  each  of  the  two  other  loan  agreements  under  the \nProgram will have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower, \nand all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of each such agreement will \nhave been fulfilled. \n(ii)  For each one of the TA loan for Strengthening of Pension, Insurance and Savings \nSystems  and  the  TA  loan  for  Regulation,  Enforcement  and  Governance  of \nFinancial Markets: that each implementing agency will have appointed a project \ndirector satisfactory to ADB; and the project will have been duly approved by the \nappropriate authorities of the Borrower. \n \nC.  Conditions for PRG Effectiveness \n \n83.  The following will be conditions for effectiveness of the PRG facilities: \n \n(i)  The Government will have duly executed and delivered a counterguarantee and \nindemnity agreement in a form satisfactory to ADB. \n \n(ii)  The Government, ADB, and the facility agent, if applicable, will have signed an \nagency agreement in a form satisfactory to ADB whereby the parties agree that \nthe  facility  agent  will  act  as  the  agent  of  ADB  and  the  Government  in \nadministering the PRG. \n \n(iii)  The terms of an initial guarantee to be issued under the PRG facility will have \nbeen negotiated to the satisfaction of ADB. \n ", "  23\nIX.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n84.  I am satisfied that the proposed program loan, technical assistance loans, and political \nrisk guarantees would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB and recommend that the \nBoard approve: \n \n(i)  the loan of $260,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Financial \n(Nonbank)  Markets  and  Governance  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board;  \n \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 2,268,000 to \nthe  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Technical  Assistance  for  Strengthening \nPension, Insurance, and Savings Systems from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board;  \n \n(iii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 2,268,000 to \nthe  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Technical  Assistance  for  Strengthening \nRegulation, Enforcement, and Governance of Financial Nonbank Markets from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements presented to the Board;  \n \n(iv)  the  political  risk  guarantee  facility  for  Enhancing  Pakistan's  Integration  with \nInternational Capital Markets covering a principal amount of up to $25,000,000 \nequivalent  in  favor  of  international  portfolio  investors  (subject  to  a \ncounterguarantee by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan), and a coguarantee program \nfor an amount of up to $125,000,000 million equivalent, in each case on such \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this \nReport, and as may be reported to the Board; and \n \n(v)  the political risk guarantee facility for Enhancing Access to Cover for Selected \nViolence-Related  Risks  covering  a  principal  amount  of  up  to  $175,000,000 \nequivalent in favor of companies with direct investment in Pakistan or their lenders \n(subject to a counterguarantee by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan) and such terms \nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this \nReport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n                  TADAO CHINO \n                  President \n \n \n11 November 2002 \n   ", "    Appendix 1  25\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.   Fiscal, Interest Rate and Investment Policy Environment  \n \n1.  A major obstacle to the development of stable financial markets, and a key factor in \nmarket segmentation, has been the differential tax treatment accorded to different financial \ninstitutions and instruments. This has created tax arbitrage and a negative impact upon the \ncompetitiveness of instruments and institutions. A market niche has been created for some \ninstitutions \u2013 investment banks (which operate like commercial banks), leasing companies and \nmodarabas1 \u2013 by taxing them at a much lower rate than commercial banks. These factors have \nnot only resulted in the proliferation of financial institutions but also distorted the link between \nfinancial operations and institutions. Another obstacle has been the frequently changing tax \nstructure, which created a great degree of uncertainty in the market.  \n \n2.  The  income  taxx  structure  that  favored  some  instruments  over  others  and  some \ncategories of investors over others is being reformed to remove these distortions. In line with \nagreements with the International Monetary Fund, a new income tax ordinance became effective \n1 July 2002. As policy objective it seeks that all income be taxed on the same basis, and tax \nincentives be considered in only a few cases for developmental or other purposes. Different \npost-tax  returns  for  instruments  with  same  risk  (but  different  investors  or  through  different \nchannels) should be avoided. It requires, among others, a simpler tax structure for individuals, \nless  emphasis  on  withholding  and  presumptive  taxes,  fewer  exemptions,  and  extension  of \nincome tax to all new issuance of National Savings Scheme (NSS) instruments. The measure \nmay need some time to be phased in to avoid fiscal disruption, giving the excessive reliance on \ntaxes from the financial sector in the current revenue scenario. \n \n3.  Another key policy impediment has been the arbitrary interference of the Government in \nthe interest rate-setting mechanism through the NSS. NSS instruments are hugely popular with \nthe general public, as they offer higher returns with lower risk than most other investment \nalternatives. Economic reasoning clearly calls for much lower rates for the NSS, but this is likely \nto be unpopular with the general public. With inflation under control, risk-free real interest for the \nNSS may well be among the highest in the world. Retail investment in capital market instruments \nis crowded out to a considerable extent by this. While NSS was originally designed as a long-\nterm savings vehicle, it is competing also with medium- and short-term saving instruments due \nto the possibility of early redemption without much penalty. Recent moves have reduced the \nrates for the NSS, but such moves have been administered in an ad-hoc manner without \nadequate link to a suitable benchmark that adequately reflects market structures. As NSS \ninstruments are risk-free retail securities, their returns should normally be lower than the level \napplicable  to  wholesale  government  securities,  and  considerably  below  private  sector \ninstruments. Likewise, there is little reasoning for the Government to borrow at higher cost from \nthe retail level than it can do wholesale through bond issues.  \n \nB.  Transparency and Corporate Governance \n \n4.  Investors in Pakistan are keenly aware of the wide information asymmetry in the capital \nmarket. There is little confidence in the accuracy of information, integrity of transactions, or \ninternal control mechanisms of the various participants.  \n \n5.  Corporate governance \u2013 which defines and structures the interacting relationships of a \ncompany\u2019s  management,  its  board,  its  shareholders,  and  other  stakeholders  \u2013  has  been \n                                                 \n1 Modarabas are finance companies that operate according to Islamic principles of finance, not involving interest. \n   ", "26  Appendix 1 \n \nrecognized as a key element for improving economic efficiencies. The development of the \ncapital market as a significant financial intermediary for the economy will depend highly on the \nframework of corporate governance adopted and the degree of adherence to the framework in \npractice. As the market develops, it in turn will play an integral role in promoting principles of \ngood governance by enforcing transparency and financial discipline on companies. \n \n6.  Improving  corporate  governance  standard  for  capital  market  development  requires \nmeasures  aimed  at  the  various  participants  involved,  including  (i)  the  issuers,  or  those \ncompanies that tap the capital market for financial resources; (ii) the intermediaries and related \nservice providers, which include the stock exchanges; the broker community; and depository, \nclearing, and settlement companies; (iii) the institutional investors; (iv) the information providers \nand advisors, including accounting and auditing firms, law firms, as well as rating agencies \nproviding services needed to bring issuers to the market place; and (v) the regulator. \n \n7.  A draft code of corporate governance was issued in March 2002 by the Securities and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) after intense stakeholder consultation. It is a first \nphase and  is aimed at listed companies. Its key elements include separation of the board of \ndirectors from management of the company, with clear distinction in their responsibilities; legal \nrepresentation  and  protection  of  minority  shareholders  through  inclusion  of  at  least  one \nindependent director on the board of the company; strengthening of internal control mechanisms \nincluding an audit committee; and improved information disclosure requirements and compliance \nstandards. If properly implemented, this is expected to have positive results on enhancing the \ntransparency and accountability of the corporate sector and the rights of minority investors. \n \n8.  Some measures have also been taken to enhance governance standards of capital \nmarket intermediaries and increase market transparency, including inclusion of nonmember \ndirectors on the boards of the stock exchanges and appointment of independent managing \ndirectors, computerization of transactions, and the establishment of a central depository system. \nHowever, some serious issues remain to be resolved. For example, the listing criteria require \nfurther updating, and the delisting process is cumbersome and time consuming. There is also \nincreasing recognition globally that stock exchanges perform a competitive business function, \nand that self-regulatory concepts promoted widely in the past have to be approached carefully \nand need strong regulatory backing. To provide efficient services to investors, many stock \nexchanges  worldwide  have  demutualized  and  adopted  corporate  structures  that  separate \nownership of the exchange from trading rights. This process may well be beneficial for Pakistan, \ntoo. Some key issues, including valuation of membership rights in the current setup, will need to \nbe resolved to carry this process forward and may require further analysis.  \n \n9.  Most critical is the widely held perception that a few well-connected insiders control \nmarket  activities.  Improper  broker  activities,  including  front  running2  and  nonseparation  of \nproprietary and client trading as well as insider trading are believed to be widespread. As a \nresult, trading is largely opportunistic and short term, and there is little genuine investor interest. \nThe market is heavily discounted, and companies with solid fundamentals and high dividend \nyields, often as high as 20%, and low price earnings ratios, often as low as 3 or 4, are left \nwithout buyers. To address this situation, transparency in trading of shares must be increased, \nand the members of the stock exchange must be required to meet a strict set of professional \nstandards; those that do not adhere to them should be properly penalized.   \n \n                                                 \n2  Front running is the practice by brokers of placing orders to buy or sell shares on the knowledge of a client\u2019s order, \nand thus raising or depressing the stock price.  \n ", "    Appendix 1  27\n10.  Both the quality and quantity of financial information made available to the public are \ninsufficient. Listed companies are required to have their accounts audited under the Companies \nOrdinance of 1984. Disclosure standards are further reinforced by the special regulatory orders \nissued by the SECP that prescribe mandatory application of International Accounting Standards \n(IAS) to listed companies and the subsidiaries. Nevertheless, financial information is often not \nreliable, and enforcement of standards remains a key issue. It is estimated that less than 30% of \nthe  listed  companies  are  audited  by  firms  with  adequate  resources  to  conduct  audits  in \naccordance with IAS. The Institute of Chartered Accountants, in its effort to improve compliance \nwith  IAS,  has  prepared  auditing  manuals  and  organized  training  workshops.  It  has  also \nestablished  an  investigation  committee  to  take  actions  for  cases  of  gross  noncompliance. \nHowever, the legal framework is still lacking for the investigation committee to be an effective \nmonitoring unit. There is the need to review the disclosure standards required by law, the \ncapacity of the auditors and their professional qualifications, their code of conduct, as well as \nenforcement capacities for strict adherence to IAS.  \n \nC.     Supply of Financial Instruments \n \n1.  Debt and Money Markets \n \n11.  The  fixed  income  market  in  Pakistan  can  be  divided  into  the  government  and  the \ncorporate  debt  markets.  Both  segments  are  still  at  an  emerging  stage.  The  wholesale \ngovernment debt instruments currently comprise Treasury bills (T-bills) of 91, 182, and 364 days \nmaturity in the short-term and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) with maturities of 3, 5, and 10 \nyears in the long-term. These securities cannot be traded in the secondary market, but have \nearly  redemption  facilities  attached  with  penalties.  There  is  no  on-line  system  for  trading, \nclearing, settlement, and registration for government securities. Transactions in T-bills and PIBs \nare settled through manual book-entry transfers submitted to the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) \nPublic Debt Office. SBP is, however, in the process of computerizing the register of government \nsecurities; it also has plans to set up a Real Time Gross Settlement System within the next 2 \nyears.  \n \n12.  The corporate bond market in Pakistan was established in 1995, although corporate \nbonds, known as Term Finance Certificates (TFCs), were privately issued as early as 1985.  \nTFCs have both a private and a public issue component, which are regulated by SECP. The \nTFC market has a maturity of up to 5 years as investors are reluctant to underwrite longer terms \nin the absence of adequate credit enhancement or other risk mitigation tools. As traditional credit \nlines through development finance institutions (DFIs) have dried up, many companies with \nmedium- to long-term funding needs have turned to issuing of TFCs for their funding needs. \nTFCs have been particularly attractive for the leasing industry. In 2002, SBP has also allowed \nbanks  to  issue  TFCs  for  raising  long-term  funds.  About  80-90%  of  the  TFC  issues  are \nsubscribed by the commercial banks and often held to maturity. Secondary market trades \u2013 \nwhich can be through the stock exchange or over-the-counter \u2013 are limited between the banks, \nand these are seldom reported. There is also a need to establish real-time market infrastructure \nand improve education services for debt market participants. \n \n13.  Money market instruments, with maturities of less than 1 year, are an important source of \nfunding in many developed and developing economies.3 Despite the inefficiencies in Pakistan\u2019s \nbanking sector, this source is not developed for the corporate sector. Introduction of instruments \nsuch as commercial paper (CP) and certificates of deposit should be encouraged. CP is an \n                                                 \n3  E.g., in the US, more than 1,700 companies issue short-term commercial paper. In India, outstanding commercial \npaper issued by corporates amounts to about $1.5 billion. \n   ", "28  Appendix 1 \n \nalternative to borrowings from banks or other financial institutions and is sold to investors who \ninvest in short-term money market instruments. Companies can fund much of their short-term \nborrowing through commercial paper, as interest rates on CP are often lower than bank lending \nrates, which makes it an attractive alternative to bank credit. Pakistan\u2019s corporate sector is keen \nto tap this source for funding its short-term requirements. This would, however, require reduction \nin issuing cost, including stamp duty, and clear guidelines on modalities. The issuance and \ntrading of CP and certificates of deposit would add more depth to the term money market in \nPakistan, which would provide important pricing signals for the construction of a yield curve.  \nMoney market mutual funds should be encouraged, as they can offer attractive alternatives to \nretail investors, in particular for short-term savings, and introduce competitive pressure on the \nbanking sector. \n \n  2.  Equity Markets \n \n14.  Despite  changes  in  the  regulatory  system  and  governing  structure  of  the  stock \nexchanges, there has been no appreciable increase in the number of retail investors in the \nrecent past. The stock exchanges in Pakistan also play a limited role in facilitating companies to \nraise resources from the public as reflected by the low figures of new issues in the recent past. \n(Only four new companies raised capital on the stock market in 1997, 1 in 1998, none in 1999, 3 \nin 2000, 2 in 2001, and 2 in 2002). While these low figures may partly reflect the macroeconomic \nsituation in the country, confidence of investors and issuers in the market is a critical issue. \nThere  has  been  a  lack  of  widespread  equity  investment  from  the  general  public  including \nthrough long-term private sector institutional investors, and this has contributed to the largely \nspeculative nature of Pakistan\u2019s stock exchange.  \n \n15.  In particular the prevalent badla system4 and its impact on the market has been the \nsubject of much debate. The question often raised is whether such a system of financing for \ncarry-over  transactions  is  necessary  for  sustaining  trade  volumes  and  market  liquidity, \nconsidering its impact on price distortions and volatility. Given the unregulated nature of badla, it \nposes  a  systemic  risk  of  destabilizing  the  market,  which  deters  long-term  investors.  Other \ncountries in South Asia, in particular India, have faced several badla-induced crises, and the \nregulators had to temporarily suspend trading operations, which severely undermined market \ncredibility. There is an urgent need to review and properly regulate the badla process and make \nit fully transparent by providing badla-related information on a timely basis. However, badla has \ngenerally been a very profitable activity for stockbrokers,5 and there has been strong broker \nlobby for its continuance with more controls. Consultation among SECP, the exchanges, and \nbrokers  should  lead  to  the  introduction  of  a  more  regulated  margin  lending  facility  as  per \ninternational practices. A stock-lending instrument should be promoted, and the futures market \nshould be more encouraged (which can be used for badla purposes). The existing provisions of \n                                                 \n4  Badla is a colloquial term for short-term trade-related transactions, based on the sale and repurchase of \nan asset that serves as collateral. It is a commonly used method of finance in Pakistan's stock market. \nBadla transactors are traders who have an existing stock of the commodity/free funds, for which another \ntrader is unable to make payment/delivery in a transaction. The purchaser enters into an agreement \nwherein the badla transactor makes the payment/delivery on his/her behalf, and takes possession of the \ncommodity/funds until the purchaser settles the transaction by repurchasing the commodity at a pre-\nagreed price (incorporating interest or mark-up) and date. The badla market operates on the basis of \ntrust, since there is no accompanied legal documentation to evidence the transaction.  \n5  Badla financing yields an average spread of 7-8% over the 6-month T-bill rates. It is estimated that on \naverage PRs3-4 billion is being invested in the KSE depending on the financing charge, market \nsentiments, and prevailing interest rates in the interbank market. The net income from this financing \nactivity is treated as a capital gain for the badla financier.  \n ", "    Appendix 1  29\nthe Companies Ordinance of 1984 may need to be reviewed in the context of margin lending by \nSECP, and suitable amendments proposed. \n \nD.  Contractual Savings and Institutional Investments \n \n16.  Institutional  investors  have  an  important  role  to  play  in  both  deepening  the  capital \nmarkets and monitoring the activities of the issuers as their shareholders. As a result, they can \nbring  stability  to  the  capital  market  and  induce  higher  corporate  governance  standards  to \ncompanies listed on the exchanges. To the individual investors, they bring alternative saving \nvehicles that would give them access to professional fund management and risk diversification. \nSuch saving vehicles would give competition to bank deposits, thus serving to increase the \nefficiency of banking operations in the longer term.  \n \n17.  The absence of a diversified and professional institutional investor base has been a \nmajor  shortcoming  in  the  capital  markets  of  Pakistan.  A  vast  potential  pool  of  institutional \ninvestors comprising mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies remains untapped.  \n \n18.  Measures are required both to improve the operations of existing institutions as well as to \npromote the development of new investors. Institutional investment in Pakistan, dominated by \ngovernment-owned  institutions,  does  not  operate  in  the  best  interests  of  the  unit  or \npolicyholders. They do not only lack proper disclosure standards and benchmarks for measuring \ninvestment performance, but have inadequate investment skills and incentive structures. Initial \nsteps would call for changes in the governance structure of the largest investors, improving the \nlegal  framework  for  fiduciary  duties;  improvement  in  information  disclosure  and  investment \nguidelines; adoption of a code of ethics and performance measurement standards; enhanced \nprofessional fund management skills; and a streamlined tax structure. Without professional skills \nfor fund management, the sizable funds held by government-owned institutions will remain \ninactive in the capital market. \n \n19.  Pakistan\u2019s mutual funds industry represents only approximately 2% of bank deposits, \ncompared with India\u2019s 12%. The industry has been tainted by the poor performance of the \ngovernment-owned mutual funds with investment objectives not in line with their obligations to \ninvestors. In addition, the mutual fund industry has suffered from unfavorable tax treatment, and \ninherent distortions that gave preferential treatment to the government-controlled funds, e.g., for \nstatutory liquidity requirements.  \n \n20.  The pension sector in Pakistan is poorly regulated, fragmented, and inefficient. Civil \nservice employees with 20 years of service and military personnel with 25 years of service are \nentitled to a tax-free defined-benefit pension, adjusted partly for inflation. This operates on an \nunfunded pay-as-you go basis, and may create a significant fiscal burden in the future if no \nmeasures to address it are initiated. The largest scheme for industrial workers is the Employees\u2019 \nOld-Age Benefit Institution (EOBI), which is a defined-benefit scheme. The scheme is mandatory \nfor selected sectors and covers approximately one million workers. Contributions are compulsory \nfor employers only, but compliance is patchy and contributions are often regarded by employers \nas another form of tax. Increases in benefits are subject to government determination rather \nthan being indexed. EOBI has accumulated about PRs45 billion in net assets to meet its pension \nobligations, but assets are expected to become rapidly depleted as the scheme approaches \nmaturity,  and  it  is  not  financially  sustainable  in  the  long  term.  The  Government  directs \ninvestment policy, and the scheme suffers from a high cost structure. Administrative costs are \nestimated to account for 16% of collected contributions. Management systems are poor, and \nrecords are acknowledged to be incomplete. The scheme has experienced recent adverse \npublicity relating to financial mismanagement and alleged fraud, and is currently, under a new \n   ", "30  Appendix 1 \n \nchairman, attempting reforms to its operational practices. There is a need for further governance \nreform, including a clear delineation of the responsibility of the board of trustees to enable \ndischarging  its  functions  in  line  with  its  fiduciary  duties.  Given  the  limited  in-house  fund \nmanagement capacity and potential to develop this effectively within the Government\u2019s pay \nstructure, EOBI may consider contracting out management of part or all of its portfolios to \ninvestment management companies. \n \n21.  Private sector companies run provident funds that pay lump sums on termination of \nemployment; defined-benefit pension plans that typically have extremely long vesting periods; \nor,  for  those  companies  providing  neither,  the  traditional  gratuity  scheme  under  which  an \nemployee receives a taxable payment based on years of service. The gratuity schemes are not \nusually separately funded. The lack of portability of the schemes is likely to have an inhibiting \neffect on labor mobility. Private pensions lack a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework, \nalthough initial steps for the formulation of a legal framework for private pension funds have \nbeen taken by SECP.  \n \n22.  Savings mobilization through life insurance remains relatively undeveloped in Pakistan,6 \nand total life insurance premiums have declined in recent years, despite the rising population. \nThe sector was nationalized in 1971 and reopened to the private sector in 1992 (a small amount \nof business is also written by the Government on a pay-as-you-go basis under the Postal Life \nscheme).  There  are  now  five  licensed  life  insurers.  While  competition  including  foreign \ninvestment in the life insurance sector is permitted under the regulatory regime, the nature of the \nbusiness  is  long-term  and  requires  a  long  gestation  period  and  commitment.  State  Life \nInsurance Corporation (SLIC) is also the country's largest institutional investor, with more than \nPRs70 billion. Thus, SLIC remains a virtual monopolist in the area of traditional life insurance \nwith about 95% market share, thanks in large part to its long history as sole provider, the \ngovernment guarantee applicable to its policies, and its countrywide distribution network.   \n \n23.  The operations of SLIC have been subject to political direction, and during the 1990s \npractices were followed that caused high turnover but at the cost of low persistency and a very \nhigh cost structure. A new executive chairman, a qualified actuary, was appointed in 2000, and \nthe company has since reported commercial improvements. It remains closely controlled by the \nMinistry of Commerce. Considerable barriers to entry and to innovation typically exist in any life \ninsurance industry. A new life insurance provider expects to take several years to establish itself, \nand during its earlier years expects to experience \"new business strain\" on its capital resources \nand therefore to report a loss for accounting purposes.7 Under management, it has so far \npursued a rather passive investment strategy and not contributed significantly to secondary \nmarket activity. \n \n24.  The depressed nature of the Pakistan economy for the majority of the history of the four \nprivate sector companies has not assisted either their development or that of the life insurance \nindustry in general. A lack of sophistication among potential clients, and limited investment \noptions  because  of  the  deficiencies  of  the  capital  markets,  have  not  encouraged  the \ndevelopment of investment-linked products. A number of foreign life insurers are known to have \nexamined the possibility of establishing an operation in Pakistan, but only two of these have \nproceeded to set up subsidiaries and only achieved mixed results so far. The private sector \ninsurers have not, in general, sought to compete directly with SLIC for individual life business but \n                                                 \n6  Total life insurance premiums in 2000 were 0.27% of gross domestic product, which is negligible compared with \nsome other countries in the region (e.g., Malaysia, 2.1%; India, 1.8%; Sri Lanka, 0.53%; and Indonesia, 0.54%).   \n7 In this context, the application of the turnover tax to life insurance is a particular problem, since it effectively \nconstitutes a tax on premiums only to new life insurance companies; mature life companies escape this impost \nbecause of the smoothed release of profits over time. \n ", "    Appendix 1  31\nhave tended to concentrate on innovative products to be sold to a niche rather than mass \nmarket. While this strategy may make sense for the new entrants themselves, it does not \naddress the issue of SLIC\u2019s domination of the traditional life insurance market. It is difficult to find \na  justification  for  government  ownership  of  a  life  insurance  near-monopoly,  and  innovative \nsolutions will be needed to increase private sector participation in the life insurance market. \n \nE.   Nonbank Financial Services and Institutions \n \n  1.  Specialized and Development Financial Institutions \n \n25.  There are numerous development and other specialized financial institutions in Pakistan, \nincluding DFIs, leasing companies, modarabas, housing finance companies, and investment \nbanks. Yet, this large number of institutions mobilize less than 5% of deposits. DFIs and housing \nfinance, in particular, have been dominated by government ownership, and are characterized by \noperational inefficiencies as well as a particularly high bad loan portfolio. The proliferation of \nother financial institutions has above all been driven by regulatory and tax arbitrage. Effective 1 \nJuly 2002, regulation and supervision for all nonbanking finance companies was transferred to \nSECP. \n \n26.  In conjunction with the banking sector reforms, the Government has also pursued DFI \nreforms through restructuring, privatization, merger, and closure. One DFI, Banker\u2019s Equity, has \nalready been liquidated and another, Investment Corporation of Pakistan, is in the process of \nliquidation;  two  DFIs  have  been  merged  with  other  government-owned  institutions.  After \nevaluation of options, the Government has decided to restructure the Industrial Development \nBank of Pakistan (IDBP) to prepare it for privatization. The main attraction for the private sector \nto purchase IDBP is the commercial banking license that IDBP holds, though its focus has \nalways been on development financing. SBP has also provided IDBP with a fresh line of credit of \nPRs5  billion  against  government  guarantee,  and  conversion  of  government  loans  of  about \nPRs12 billion into equity is expected to improve IDBP's balance sheet, while bad assets will be \ntransferred to the Corporate and Industrial Restructuring Corporation, a government-run asset \nmanagement company, for auction.  \n \n27.  Housing finance has served as an engine of economic growth in many countries but has \nfailed to do so in Pakistan. Housing finance is closely linked with capital market development. \nHousing  finance  companies  typically  need  long-term  funds  to  fund  their  long-term  housing \nassets, and housing finance receivables are normally well suited for asset securitization. For \nimproving the housing stock in the country, the Government needs to institute the required \nregulatory framework for major financial institutions to enter the housing finance market in a \nsignificant  way.  Existing  constraints  in  enforcing  foreclosure  laws  should  be  addressed,  a \nrefinance window should be set up for refinancing of housing finance extended by housing \nfinance companies, and ground rules for housing finance companies to raise funds need to be \nestablished, among others.   \n \n28.  Other forms of specialized finance include leasing, modarabas, and investment banks. \nThere is a need to further consolidate the sector in order to have fewer but stronger institutions. \nPrudential standards in particular need to be improved. \n \n  2.  Insurance \n \n29.  Total net premiums in the nonlife insurance market represent about 0.37% of gross \ndomestic product, a low figure compared with some other countries in the region (e.g., Malaysia, \n1.6%; Thailand, 1.0%; Sri Lanka, 0.7%; Iran, 0.7%; Indonesia, 0.7%; India, 0.6%). Although \n   ", "32  Appendix 1 \n \nthere are more than 50 nonlife insurers, the market remains dominated by a small number of \ninsurers, among which the National Insurance Company Limited  retains its monopoly over the \ninsurance  of  \"public  property\"  (a  term  that  includes  externally  financed  projects  and \nGovernment-owned enterprises).  In the private sector, five companies control the large majority \nof total premium income.  Many of the small players were established as captive insurers and \nare financially weak. The sector is characterized by a high cost structure and a low claims ratio.  \n \n30.  Earlier,  the  Controller  of  Insurance  within  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  regulated  the \ninsurance sector. However, to reduce fragmentation and consolidate the regulatory activities of \nthe financial sector, the Government in 1999 assigned the task to SECP. A new Insurance \nOrdinance was promulgated in 2000 to replace the Insurance Act of 1938. The new law has \nbeen introduced to strengthen the regulatory system, improve the financial base of insurance \ncompanies  by  increasing  minimum  paid-up  capital  and  solvency  requirements,  improve \nadministration  in  the  insurance  sector,  and  protect  policy  holders.  The  minimum  capital \nrequirement has been raised from PRs40 million to PRs80 million for nonlife insurance, and from \nPRs100 million to PRs150 million for companies dealing in life insurance. The first increases in \npaid-up capital requirements come into effect on from 31 December 2002, and a number of \nnonlife insurers appear unlikely to meet the new requirements. These requirements have to be \nmet by 31 December 2004.  Additionally, the statutory deposit to be maintained with SBP has \nbeen  raised  to  the  higher  of  PRs10  million  or  10%  of  the  paid-in  capital.  Under  the  new \nlegislation, audited accounts have to be submitted within 4 months of the end of the period to \nwhich they relate. Limits prescribed on commission and expenses of management have also \nbeen eliminated. Provisions in the new ordinance have been made for an insurance ombudsman \nand the constitution of an insurance tribunal. \n \n31.  The recent reforms initiated are starting to have an effect on the insurance industry, \nalthough many of its provisions are being phased in, and implementation of some existing \nrequirements is as yet not as robust as it could be. SECP\u2019s Insurance Division has been \nestablished with a commissioner at its head and has acquired a number of staff. It does, \nhowever, experience difficulties due to the lack of professional insurance experience available to \nit.  Both the regulator and the companies are feeling their way in the new structure, and a corpus \nof  guidance  and  interpretation  needs  to  be  established.  The  implementation  process  also \nremains incomplete, since rules have not yet been gazetted. Until this is in place the regulator \nhas only limited information on which to base its analysis of a company\u2019s position. \n \n32.  Under  the  new  Insurance  Ordinance,  compulsory  reinsurance  cession  to  Pakistan \nReinsurance Company Limited (PRCL) has been reduced to 15% and will be eliminated by \n2004. Insurers are still required to give PRCL first refusal of a proportion of excess reinsurance \ncover. In addition, insurance companies are being expected to get themselves reinsured by \"A\" \nrated insurance companies. SECP is also reviewing a proposal for insurance companies to get \ntheir insurance claim paying ability rated by rating companies like PACRA. Several insurers \namong the group of small, low-capitalized companies have been placed on notice of regulatory \naction for failure to obtain adequate reinsurance arrangements.   \n \n33.  As  has  been  the  case  worldwide,  Pakistan  insurers  have  been  faced  with  rising \nreinsurance costs. In the case of terrorism insurance, insurers have been unable to obtain \nreinsurance cover at all, and as a consequence have largely withdrawn terrorism cover from \ntheir own policies. While the immediate impact of this withdrawal of cover may be limited so far \nas concerns the majority of domestic insurance coverage, the impact is significant for major \nrisks, where insurance coverage tends to be a condition of financing. The absence of coverage \nfor terrorism risk may effectively prevent the raising of finance for future projects, and endanger \nthe sustainability of existing investments. \n ", "Appendix 2  33\n \nPROCESSING APPROACH, BACKGROUND STUDIES AND CHRONOLOGY \n \n1.  In  supporting  the  Government  to  formulate  the  Financial  (Nonbank)  Markets  and \nGovernance  Program,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  followed  a  process-based \napproach with intense stakeholder consultation. There is considerable understanding within \nPakistan of the issues impeding financial markets development, both in the public and private \nsector, and no shortage of proposals for solution. However, despite a common vision and desire \nof  all  stakeholders  to  see  markets  progress,  views  are  diverging  on  how  best  to  achieve \nprogress. This is often influenced by conflicting short-term interests and different assessment of \nconstraints and needs. Thus, ADB\u2019s role in formulating the Program has not been a prescriptive \none, but rather to foster an educated dialogue that has led to agreement on a structured reform \nagenda with broad-based support by all participants. The Program seeks commitment from and \noffers an opportunity to the various parties involved to make a contribution to the reform process \nwithin a comprehensive overall framework. \n \n2.  The program content is based on intensive consultation and insights gained by ADB \nthrough  ongoing  dialogue  over  the  past  few  years  with  senior  public  and  private  sector \nstakeholders, as well as the analytical work carried out in conjunction with the implementation of \nthe first Capital Market Development Program.  Background studies were carried out under  \n(i)  TA 2812: Interest Management of the National Savings Scheme (Final Report, 1999); \n(ii)  TA 2865: Restructuring of Public Sector Mutual Funds (Final Report, 1999); \n(iii)  TA 2866: Reform of the Insurance Industry (Final Report, 2000); \n(iv)  TA 2867: Reform of Pension and Provident Funds  (Final Report, 2001); \n(v)  TA  3559:  Enhancing  Capacity  Market  Depth  (including  a  survey  on  market \nimpediments and a high level workshop with extensive private sector participation \nheld in September 2001); and \n(vi)  TA loan 1577: Capacity Enhancement of the Securities Market, including reports for \nCorporate Development for the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, \nBuilding of a Self-Regulatory Structure for the Stock Exchanges, Development of the \nMutual Funds Industry, and Development of a Secondary Debt Market.  \n \n3.  The following key processing steps were involved in formulation of the program: \n(i)  Reconnaissance Mission: 26 February to 6 March 2002;  \n(ii)  Fact Finding Mission: 6 to 24 May 2002; \n(iii)  1st Management Review Meeting: 1 July 2002; \n(iv)  Appraisal Mission: 13 to 25 August 2002; \n(v)  Guarantee Committee Meeting: 12 September 2002; \n(vi)  2nd Management Review Meeting: 20 September 2002; and \n(vii)  Loan Negotiations: 7-9 October 2002. \n \n4.

Less 30% allowance for below taxable limit, net capital gain is \nPRs67.2 billion. Assuming 12.5% average income tax rate, tax foregone in FY02 would amount to PRs8.4 billion. \nFor FY03 and FY04, lesser increase in market capitalization than in FY02 is expected (i.e., increase of 20% in \nFY03 and 15% in FY04 and FY05). In FY05, exemptions will only be granted to long-term investors with holdings \nlonger than 6 months, estimated at 30% of total holdings. \nb Total unrealized losses for nonbank financial institutions are estimated at PRs43 billion. CBR has assumed for \nbudgetary purposes that PRs1.8 billion will be absorbed in FY02 through merger in the sector and subsequently \nbe eligible for income tax deduction.

Background and Rationale  \n \n1.  Pakistan\u2019s pension system at present is fragmented, without a central framework for \nregulation  or  supervision,  to  encourage  retirement  savings  and  protection  for  beneficiaries. \nAlthough Pakistan does not at this time face the same urgent demographic pressures as some \ncountries, the lack of a clear policy inhibits long-term labor and social security planning. Pension \nsavings typically serve as a vehicle for financial intermediation and are of significant importance \nfor capital market development. It is therefore appropriate to support the development of a policy \nthat will encourage retirement savings through regulations and appropriate incentives.  \n \n2.  Like many countries, Pakistan operates an unfunded pension scheme for its civil service \nand military personnel. This scheme is noncontributory, and benefits are linked to final salary. \nThe scheme therefore has an unfounded liability representing the projected entitlements of \nexisting pensioners until death and the accrued entitlements of those who are currently in work \nbut who will become entitled to benefits on retirement. The amount of the unfounded liability is a \nhidden component of government debt. To assist in the management of this liability, an initial \nassessment  is  required  of  the  projected  cash  flows  under  the  system,  following  which  an \nappropriate strategy may be desired.  \n \n3.  The largest pension vehicle for workers is the Employee's Old-Age Benefits Institution \n(EOBI). It currently covers approximately one million workers in selected industry sectors and \nmanages  funds  in  excess  of  about  PRs45  billion.  Contribution  compliance  is  patchy, \nmanagement systems are very poor, and records are acknowledged to be incomplete. The \nscheme is run on a pay-as-you-go basis and is not financially sustainable over the long run in its \npresent form. It has suffered from financial mismanagement and a high administrative cost \nstructure. EOBI is currently under a new chairman, and has initiated reforms to improve its \noperational practices. An in-depth assessment of EOBI and its strategic options by external \nexperts will support this process. Assistance would also be required for implementation of \nrecommendations.  \n \n4.  The potential for old-age savings through life insurance in Pakistan is poorly developed. \nThe sector is dominated by the government-controlled State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC). \nOverall reforms related to sector policies and governance of SLIC will be promoted under the \nFinancial (Nonbank) Markets and Governance  Program. On the institutional level, SLIC has \nunder  its  new  chairman  started  internal  reforms  to  improve  operational  effectiveness  and \nadministrative  efficiency.  To  further  support  these  efforts,  external  assistance  is  required, \nparticularly in the areas of investment management, field office operations, and computerization. \n \n5.  The  Central  Directorate  of  National  Savings  (CDNS)  is  the  key  agency  for  the \nadministration of the National Savings Scheme (NSS). The scheme is currently on an unfunded \nbasis. Records are kept primarily on a manual basis, which makes data consolidation and \nanalysis administratively cumbersome and time consuming.  Given the economic significance of \nthe NSS \u2013 the total liability volume is about PRs700 billion \u2013 there is a need to improve debt \nmanagement and administrative efficiency. In particular, the long-term implications of operating \nthe NSS as an unfunded system within a market environment need to be assessed further, and \noptions, e.g., for conversion into a funded scheme (with investments primarily in government \nsecurities) may be evaluated. \n   ", "52  Appendix 8 \n \nB.   Objectives and Scope \n \n6.  The objective of the technical assistance (TA) are to (i) assess key issues Pakistan is \nfacing  in  managing  pension  and  saving  liabilities;  (ii)  recommend  solutions  to  improve \nsustainability; and (iii) strengthen key public sector institutions involved in pensions, insurance, \nand savings mobilization.  \n \n7.  The TA will comprise five components:  \n \n1.  Establishment of an Overall Framework for Pension Provision \n \n8.  The TA will provide an in-depth analysis of the current framework (building on previous \nwork already been done by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Ministry of \nLabor, and Asian Development Bank), which will serve as the basis for discussion among key \nstakeholders on the overall framework, with recommendations being formulated to identify long-\nterm requirements for an adequate national pension and provident fund system in Pakistan and \na strategy for achieving this during the next 10 years. The strategy recommended by the TA \ncoordination committee should be formally adopted by the Government, together with an action \nplan for implementation to be developed under the TA.  \n \n2.  Financial Assessment of Civil and Military Pension Schemes \n \n9.  During its first phase, the TA will assess the financial status and the sustainability of the \ncivil service and military scheme and its overall fiscal impact on the government budget. As \nneeded, the TA will outline options for redesign and will explore the financial feasibility of \ntransition from a government pillar (pillar 1) pension scheme, to a multipillar pension scheme.  It \nwill assess the administrative, financial, and fiscal costs and benefits as well as risks and options \nfor phasing in a second pillar;, and develop options for partial or full migration to such schemes \nby the government employees. It will also calculate the public sector transition costs to such \nschemes and estimate the long-term fiscal benefit.  \n \n3.  Institutional Reform and Strengthening of EOBI  \n \n10.  Based on an updated in-depth assessment on the operations and financial positions of \nEOBI (building on earlier work undertaken by ADB and the Ministry of Labor/EOBI), the TA will \ndesign a framework and present practical options with clear cost implications for modernizing \nEOBI into a more efficient, transparent, and sustainable private sector pension and provident \nfund system. The modernization plan will include timing and costing and be consistent with the \nbroad context of strategic framework on pensions adopted by the Government. Subsequent to \nthe formulation of the plan and approval by the relevant authorities, the modernization plan will \nbe pilot tested at the headquarters and several selected branch offices.  \n \n4.  Capacity Building for Investment Management of SLIC  \n \n11.  The consultants will assist SLIC with the implementation of measures to improve its \ninvestment  management,  including  development  of  investment  strategies,  performance \nparameters, internal controls, field office operations, and streamlining and computerization of \noperations. In particular, the investment management experts will assess investment policy, \nsystems and procedures for funds management and develop and implement approaches that \noptimize returns with risks. The consultants will develop adequate benchmarks for performance \nmeasurement, and an effective control mechanism to ensure accountability and transparency in \n ", "    Appendix 8  53\noperations. The consultants will also provide hands-on assistance to SLIC's top management in \nstreamlining field operations in line with best international practices.  \n \n5.  Institutional Reform and Strengthening of CDNS  \n \n12.  The TA will assess institutional constraints of the NSS and recommend measures to \nimprove transparency in financial management. It will assess the merits and feasibility of moving \ntowards a funded scheme managed with a well-conceived investment policy in government \nsecurities. It will also assist in establishing basic parameters for such a move, and determine \nhow the different schemes could be rationalized and the rates on small saving schemes made \nmarket oriented. The TA will also support streamlining, modernization and computerization of \noperations already initiated by CDNS. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $4,500,000 equivalent, comprising $2,390,000 \nin foreign exchange costs and $2,110,000 equivalent in local currency costs.

Background and Rationale  \n \n1.  Regulation and governance of Pakistan's capital market and the corporate sector gained \nsome  credibility  with  the  commencement  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  of \nPakistan's (SECP) operations at the beginning of 1999. SECP\u2019s role was further enhanced in \n1999 when it was assigned regulatory responsibility for the insurance industry, and in 2002 \nwhen it was assigned regulatory responsibility for private pensions and other nonbank financial \ninstitutions (NBFIs), including leasing, housing, and investment banks. SECP has thus assumed \na significant role. It is still a fairly new institution, and many of the functions it is performing were \nnot done previously, or are done in a manner that requires a fundamental change. Given the \ncritical importance of SECP for capital and nonbank financial markets, it is important that is has \nadequate capacity \u2013 skills, systems, and procedures \u2013 to effectively discharge its functions. \n \n2.  Previous technical assistance (TA)1 to SECP helped put in place the basic strategic, \nmanagement,  and  administrative  foundations  for  SECP.  It  also  helped  to  raise  prudential \nstandards of key market participants and develop a national clearing and settlement system. \nFurther  than  this,  SECP  has  initiated  on  its  own  a  number  of  measures  to  improve  and \nrestructure Pakistan\u2019s securities markets, including structural reform of the stock exchanges and \nimprovements in risk management. To ensure accountability and transparency in the corporate \nsector, SECP has formulated a code of corporate governance in coordination with the Institute of \nChartered Accountants in Pakistan (ICAP). Further challenges arise with its newly enhanced \nmandate in insurance, pensions, and NBFI regulation and supervision. Beyond its regulatory \nand supervisory functions for investor and policyholder protection, SECP fulfills a development \nmandate.  This  also  includes  support  for  the  development  of  professional  standards  and \nknowledge dissemination.  \n \n3.  Despite these positive developments, the regulatory framework and institutional structure \nrequire flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances and emerging challenges. Given the \nfast changing nature and increasing complexity of modern financial markets, there is a need to \nfurther support the industry regulator and market participants to upgrade their skill base.  \n \nB.   Objectives and Scope \n \n4.  The TA will build on previous assistance already provided to SECP to support the sound \nand  sustainable  development  of  nonbank  financial  markets,  application  of  proper  risk \nmanagement practices, and protection of investors and policyholders. The TA will include the \nreview and update of the legal and regulatory framework as required, and building capacity \nwithin SECP for effective regulation through hands-on advice and training for (i) on-site and off-\nsite  surveillance,  including  of  NBFIs;  (ii)  supervision  of  reformed  and  new  exchanges;  (iii) \nregulation  and  supervision  of  the  insurance  and  pension  industry;  and  (iv)  regulation  and \nsupervision of the derivatives market. In addition, the TA will provide assistance to SECP and \nthe  stock  exchanges  in  developing  and  implementing  a  plan  for  demutualization  of  the \nexchanges, and support measures to upgrade the skills of market participants.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997.

Upgrading of the Legal and Regulatory Framework \n \n6.  The TA will identify areas of overlap, inconsistencies, and gaps in existing regulations \ngoverning Pakistan\u2019s nonbank financial markets, and recommend legal and regulatory changes \nfor a comprehensive and consistent regulatory agenda. This will seek to further align market \nrules  and  regulations  with  international  standards,  formulate  recommendations  to  extend \nelements of the corporate governance code beyond listed companies, assist in drafting and \nimproving regulations for contractual savings including insurance and private pensions, and \nimprove the quality of information disclosure. This component will also help to better define roles \nand responsibilities for rule making and enforcement between the industry regulator and various \nself-regulatory organizations, including the stock exchanges and professional associations. The \nconsultants may in the process assist in drafting any amendments that the regulatory agenda \nmay require, or any revision in the statutes to upgrade self-regulatory capacities.  \n \n2.  Capacity Building of SECP (with particular attention to its enlarged mandate \nfor regulation and supervision of NBFIs, insurance, and pensions) \n \n7.  This component will strengthen the various functional wings and divisions of SECP. This \nwill include a review of the operational processes of SECP, and updating in particular those for \nregulation and supervision of NBFIs, insurance, and pension systems. It will also strengthen \nenforcement including assistance in conducting on-site and off-site examinations. The TA will \nalso undertake a thorough review of the existing badla system and an assessment of its impact \non  market  distortions  and  volatility,  with  a  view  to  phasing  out  the  current  system  and \nreplacement  through  a  derivatives  market;  recommend  regulations  for  stock  lending  and \nsystems  for  margin  trading;  and  update,  as  required,  existing  futures  regulations  including \ncontract specifications. This component will also assist in the implementation of an options \nmarket,  including  drafting  of  regulations  and  updating  SECP  staff  on  in  relevant  risk \nmanagement  methods  applicable  to  Pakistan  for  derivative  instruments  including  margin \nconcepts and supervisory capacity of SECP over the derivatives market.  This will also include a \nreview and upgrading of SECP\u2019s management information system, as required, to enhance and \nstrengthen the market information and surveillance operations of SECP.  \n \n3.  Support for Restructuring of Stock Exchanges \n \n8.  Based on the experiences and methodology followed in developed markets, the TA will \nassist the stock exchanges and SECP in assessing different models of demutualization for the \nexchanges  and  their  applicability  to  Pakistan.  Through  a  consultative  process  with  key \nstakeholders, the TA will develop a comprehensive strategy and detailed implementation plan. \nThe consultants will assist the exchanges to value their businesses and carry out changes in \ntheir statutes and regulations that would be required. In this context the potential integration of \nthe three markets to a national stock market, or development of a new national market, may be \nconsidered as well.  Some of the key issues to be resolved under this component include (i) \nvaluation and distribution of shares among members, and  (ii) remuneration for the membership \nfee paid by existing members.  \n \n4.  Establishment  of  Sustainable  Mechanisms  for  Skills  Development  and \nTraining \n \n9.  The component will ascertain the types of professional expertise needed by the market, \nreview existing programs and facilities for training market participants, and assess skills of SECP \nstaff and market participants. The TA will also examine and establish standards for various \n   ", "58  Appendix 9 \n \nprofessions such as portfolio managers or insurance brokers, in line with international practices \nand as appropriate for Pakistan. Based on the needs analysis, the consultant will design a \ncomprehensive approach for training market participants, and work with industry associations \n(such  as  the  Leasing  Association  of  Pakistan)  or  special  training  institutes  (such  as  the \nInsurance Institute of Pakistan) to develop professional curricula including, e.g., for brokers and \nfund  managers,  and  measures  for  enhanced  professional  education.  Web-based  training \nmodules may be developed for self-learning, to be posted on the SECP or other relevant \nwebsite. The TA will explore the feasibility and assist in the establishment of a training institute \nfor capital market development. This component will also promote twinning arrangements and \nsecondment of SECP staff to other regulators, and further measures to upgrade skills of SECP \nstaff. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $4,400,000 equivalent, comprising $2,365,000 \nin  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $2,035,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.

ADB will provide a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR2,268,000 ($3 million \nequivalent) from its Special Funds resources with an amortization term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the TA Loan Agreement.  \n \n12.  ADB will finance 68.2% of the total cost of the TA, including international and domestic \nconsultant services, a part of the cost of computer hardware and systems development, training \nprograms and activities, as well as interest charges during implementation. The Government and \nbeneficiaries (stock exchanges) will finance 31.8% of the total cost, mainly for the counterpart \nbudget of the executing and implementing agencies, including counterpart staff and facilities for \nthe consulting team, taxes and duties on equipment, and taxes on consultants, as well as part of \nthe computer equipment.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  The Executing Agency \n \n13.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be SECP.  SECP will provide the necessary office \nspace, counterpart staff, local transportation, and other services to the consultants. SECP will \nclosely coordinate with other stakeholders involved in the implementation of the TA, including \nthose from the private sector.  \n \n14.  SECP  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  TA  in  accordance  with \naccounting procedures acceptable to ADB. The accounts of SECP and the TA will be audited \nannually by independent auditors in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. \nCertified copies of the audited accounts and financial statements and the report of the auditors \nwill be submitted to ADB in English within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year.  \n \n  2.  Schedule, Reports, and Reviews \n \n15.  The TA is planned to commence as soon as practicable following the effective date of the \nTA loan, to be completed over a period of 18 month after inception and before December 2004. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. During the inception phase, the team leader \nand lead consultants of the various components will revalidate the policy objectives and assess \npriorities,  key  issues,  and  capacity-building  needs  on  the  governance,  regulatory,  and \noperational level. At the end of this phase, resource inputs may be adjusted as appropriate \nwithin the overall budgetary framework and TA scope, to better align the terms of reference, \nactivities, and time-bound outputs with client expectations and needs. This will also include the \nrefinement  of  performance  parameters  for  the  consultants.  During  the  design  phase,  the \nconsultants will formulate and detail the capacity-building and operational development plans. \nDuring  the  implementation  phase,  the  consultants  will  implement  and  document  required \nregulations, procedures, and systems, as well as arrange for training and skill development \nactivities as appropriate.  \n \n17.  The team of consultants will prepare an inception report on the respective components \nwithin 4 weeks of the commencement of their services. In addition to any full report required at \nthe end of each individual component, the consultants and SECP will submit quarterly progress \nreports. The final report, including complete documentation of all outputs, will be submitted \n   ", "60  Appendix 9 \n \nwithin 3 months of the end of the assignment, after the comments of ADB and the Government \nhas been incorporated.  \n \n18.  In addition to regular and ongoing interaction among SECP, ADB, and the consultants, a \ncomprehensive midterm review will be undertaken jointly by ADB, SECP, and the consultants \nabout 9 months after project inception to review all aspects of implementation.  \n \n  3.  Procurement \n \n19.  The  computer  hardware  and  software  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement.  Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost \nthe equivalent of more than $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of international competitive \nbidding.  Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost the equivalent of \n$500,000 or less (other than minor items) will be awarded on the basis of international shopping.  \n \n  4.  Consulting Services \n \n20.  The TA will require about 109 person-months of consulting services, including 55 person-\nmonths of international and 54 person-months of domestic consulting services. The team of \nconsultants will be selected from a reputable firm with a proven track record in financial markets \ndevelopment and capacity building, and will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants under the quality-based selection method2, or other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. Separate subcontracting of \nservices for individual consultants or firms, in addition to the main contract, may be required for \nspecialist tasks under components 3 and 4 of the TA. \n \n21.  The consultant team will include skills and expertise in (i) team leadership; (ii) legal \nframeworks and regulation of capital markets, insurance, pensions, and NBFIs;  (iii) corporate \ngovernance;  (iv)  stock  exchange  models  and  operations;  (v)  nonbank  financial  market \ndevelopment; (vi) risk management, with particular expertise in derivative products; (vii) market \nmonitoring, surveillance, and enforcement; (viii) information technology, in particular electronic \ntrading, clearing, and settlement platforms; and (ix) training and skills development for financial \nmarkets. The consultants under the team must possess strong communication and teamwork \nskills, and the capacity to respond to client needs in a flexible, pragmatic, and professional \nmanner. \n \n22.  Throughout  TA  implementation,  the  consultants  will  work  closely  with  SECP  staff, \nmaintaining active day-to-day communication. The consultants will also be required to maintain \nan active dialogue with private sector parties (such as the stock exchanges, ICAP or other \nrelevant parties) as required. The international consultants will also work closely and in a team \nwith the domestic experts, who will advise on Pakistan\u2019s legal and regulatory system and \noperational practices. Extensive field presence by the international consultants is envisaged. \nPakistan  nationals  with  relevant  expertise  and  international  experience  are  eligible  for \ninternational consultant positions. \n                                                 \n2 The quality-based selection method will be applied in light of the TA's nonstandardized nature and emphasis on \nqualitative inputs. \n ", "    Appendix 10  61\nPOLITICAL RISK GUARANTEE FACILITY FOR \nENHANCING PAKISTAN\u2019S INTEGRATION WITH INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS \n \nA.  Background and Rationale \n \n1.  Despite  considerable  improvement  in  market  infrastructure  for  the  past  few  years, \nPakistan\u2019s financial markets have remained depressed, and foreign portfolio investment has \nbeen negative (resulting in a further downward trend of the market). The reasons included weak \nmacroeconomic  fundamentals  as  well  as  poor  governance  and  transparency  in  financial \nmarkets. In addition, international investors have shied away amid a generally high perception of \ncountry risk. As a result, even good companies with solid operations, sound management, and \nstrong cash flows are very cheaply valued by international standards, with low price/earnings \nratios and high dividend yields. In addition, there has been good progress in developing a \ncorporate bond market, with more than $300 million equivalent of term finance certificates issued \nsince 2001, as well as a fast-growing market for tradeable government debt offering attractive \nreturns  in  real  terms  compared  with  other  markets.  With  the  recent  stabilization  of  the \nmacroeconomic situation and consistency in financial market and governance reforms pursued \nunder  the  Financial  (Nonbank)  Markets  and  Governance  (FMG)  Program,  Pakistan  offers \npotentially attractive investment alternatives.  \n \n2.  Pakistan  has  a  relatively  large  population  resident  abroad,  which  constitutes  a \nconsiderable investment pool that has so far not been tapped in a systematic and formal manner \nfor investment in Pakistan. Further investigation \u2013 including a visit in early 2002 by a delegation \nof leading Pakistan capital market professionals to a number of international destinations with \nsizeable Pakistan overseas population \u2013 confirmed a very strong interest by overseas Pakistanis \nto invest in Pakistan\u2019s financial markets, in particular in debt instruments, and identified formal \nmarket access and cross-border risk among the key concerns.  \n \n3.  Mobilization of institutional investment is key for new initial public offerings, to develop \nsecondary trading and increase the depth of securities markets. The policy initiatives under the \nFMG  Program  strongly  aim  at  mobilizing  domestic  resources.  Yet,  this  will  develop  only \ngradually over time, and there is both a need and considerable potential to accelerate the \nprocess by tapping into international portfolio investment.1 \n \n4.  By  providing  suitable  modalities  that  address  key  investor  concerns,  access  to \ninternational capital flows and integration of Pakistan with international financial markets can be \nenhanced. In particular, this will allow a change in the investor profile in debt markets through \nprofessional fund managers who more actively try to optimize market opportunities, thereby \nenhancing liquidity, and an increase in fund management expertise in Pakistan. In conjunction \nwith the reforms under the FMG Program, this can be achieved through a revolving political risk \nguarantee (PRG) facility, which will cover selected risks for investment that is carried out through \nformal channels. This will allow investors to concentrate on the economic and commercial \naspects of the investment.  \n \nB.  Objectives, Scope, and Basic Principles \n \n5.  The objectives of the proposed PRG facility are to (i) strengthen confidence for overseas \ninvestors and support the country's integration into international capital markets through formal \n                                                 \n1 It is generally considered desirable to have about 10-20% of international investment in a country's financial market. \nIn Pakistan, however, this share had dropped to only about 2% at the end of FY2002. \n   ", "62  Appendix 10 \n \nchannels; (ii) develop, diversify, and broaden professional institutional investment vehicles and \nthereby stimulate secondary market activity, particularly in the debt markets; and (iii) attract \npolitical risk insurance (PRI) providers from the private sector to reestablish cover for Pakistan, \ninitially  under  the  umbrella  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB)  coguarantee  program \n(CGP).2 \n \n6.  PRGs issued under the facility will guarantee repatriation of proceeds from investments \nin debt instruments, including listed corporate bonds, corporate commercial paper, as well as \ngovernment paper. It will create cross-border political risk-taking capacity, focusing on currency \ninconvertibility and transfer cover. \n \n7.  The PRG facility will have a revolving nature, allowing individual PRGs to be issued on a \ncase-by-case basis in line with the facility agreements, and after due diligence by ADB on \neligibility. The PRG facility will be uncommitted, giving ADB and the Government the right to \ncancel unutilized limits after consultation at any time with prior notice. \n \n8.  Pricing  of  each  PRG  will  be  market  based  to  appeal  only  to  investors  who  would \notherwise  be  unlikely  to  invest  in  Pakistan.  Thus,  the  PRG  will  not  give  rise  to  \"adverse \nselection\" (i.e., a situation where investors routinely request this).  \n \n9.  To comfort investors that they will be able to safely remit the proceeds from the sale of \ntheir securities, PRGs issued under the facility must be of unquestioned quality, cost effective, \nand provided in line with best international practice. Initial exposure will be counterguaranteed \nby the Government. \n \n10.  The PRG facility will be designed to leverage ADB\u2019s exposure by attracting private sector \nPRI providers through the comfort being offered under ADB\u2019s CGP. ADB will also seek parallel \nguarantee  arrangements  with  official  guarantee  agencies,  such  as  the  Overseas  Private \nInvestment  Corporation  or  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency,  under  the  proposed \nimplementation structure. Over time, it is expected that private PRI providers will progressively \ntake over the bulk of the liability under the facility as they become more comfortable with \nPakistan cross-border political risk associated with portfolio investment. This will give ADB and \nthe Government an exit strategy and make sure that investors do not become dependent on \nADB and the Government for cover offered by the facility.  \n \n11.  The  PRG  facility  will  take  advantage  of  previous  experience  gained  by  ADB  in \nimplementation of similar vehicles. To the extent possible, the PRG facility will be structured in a \nsimilar manner as the PRG facility for Letter of Credit Confirmations under the Small and \nMedium  Enterprise  Trade  Enhancement  Finance  Project,  which  was  made  effective  in \nSeptember 2001. \n \nC.  Major Terms, Conditions, and Arrangements of the Proposed PRG Facility \n \nFacility:  A revolving PRG facility with government counterguarantee covering primarily \ncurrency inconvertibility and transfer blockage, and other cross-border political \nrisks (as defined in the PRG documentation in line with ADB\u2019s guarantee policy). \nUnder the facility, ADB will issue PRGs, from time to time and on a case-by-\n                                                 \n2 As a multilateral development finance institution ADB is in a strong position to leverage private sector risk cover. \nUnder the PRG CGP, ADB will however not be liable for any amount owed by the PRI provider to the investors as a \nresult  of  a  claim.

To discourage speculative capital flows, funds must remain invested \nand Investors:   in Pakistan for at least 6 months.  \nEligible investments include tradable debt instruments issued by the corporate \nsector or the Government, as well as loans to financial intermediaries for the \npurpose of nonbank financial market development, made through guaranteed \ninvestors. \nGuaranteed  investors,  or  participating  financial  intermediaries  (PFIs),  may \ninclude formal institutional investment vehicles such as mutual and pension \nfunds  or  other  corporate  entities,  with  adequate  professional  investment \nmanagement expertise. \nGuaranteed  Loss as a result of  \nRisks: \n\u2022  foreign exchange inconvertibility or transferability blockage; or  \n\u2022  other  related  and  clearly  definable  politically  motivated  event  directly \naffecting  the  orderly  sale,  payment  of  interest,  or  repayment  of  the \nunderlying investment (as agreed upon with the Government in the PRG \ndocumentation in line with market needs).  \nIn any event, ADB will not guarantee, indemnify, or cover loss as a result of \nbreach of contract or any commercial or other market-related risk.  \nGuarantor:  ADB will be the sole Guarantor, backed by its ordinary capital resources up to \nan aggregate liability under the facility of $25 million equivalent (the ADB limit). \nFor any amount in excess of the ADB limit, ADB will be acting as guarantor-of-\nrecord, under the PRG CGP, for one or more private sector PRI providers that \nwish to participate in the facility. \nCounter- The Government of Pakistan will provide a counterguarantee and indemnity to \nguarantor:  ADB in an amount of not less than the ADB limit (the counterguarantee limit) so \nthat ADB\u2019s exposure will always be counterguaranteed. \nAmounts in excess of the counterguarantee limit will be without Government \ncounterguarantee, but will benefit from ADB\u2019s CGP up to the total facility limit. \nFacility Limit:  The initial facility limit will not exceed the ADB limit of $25 million equivalent. \nADB will seek to attract other PRI providers to expand the facility limit, and the \ntotal facility limit can be increased gradually for an additional amount of up to \n$125 million under ADB\u2019s PRG CGP. This could bring the total facility limit up to \n$150 million. \nThe facility limit is based on estimated demand and market potential. Due to the \nrevolving nature of the facility, actual utilization of limits is expected to fluctuate \nover time in line with changing perception of country risk and corresponding \nchange in risk premiums.  \nMaximum Limit  The maximum liability under any PRG swill be the lesser of \nof Liability per \n\u2022  90% of the net sale proceeds of the guaranteed investment, or  \nPRG Issued: \n\u2022  the agreed cover amount; \nplus 90% of accrued interest or other income.  \n   ", "64  Appendix 10 \n \nThe agreed cover amount is the purchase price of the investment on the day the \ninvestment  is  made.  PFIs  will  have  the  option  to  periodically  increase  or \ndecrease the agreed cover amount to reflect the prevailing market price of the \ninvestment or investments covered. \nClaims  Claims made by the beneficiary under a PRG will be paid by ADB when a \nManagement:  guaranteed risk has occurred after appropriate waiting periods and evaluation \nfollowing sound market practice. The guarantee amount paid will be not more \nthan the maximum limit of liability of the PRG. The beneficiary will surrender \nlocal  currency  proceeds  as  realized  from  the  sale  of  the  underlying  debt \ninvestment to ADB or its nominee. \nPRG Pricing:  A market-based guarantee fee (premium) payable by the PFI will be charged \nperiodically  in  advance  as  a  percentage  per  annum  on  the  agreed  cover \namount. The premium will reflect the Pakistan country risk premium for the \nselected risks as well as ADB fees and administrative charges needed to cover \nthe cost of establishment and operation of the PRG, and may be adjusted from \ntime to time. \nIndicative market soundings by ADB with potential investors suggest that the \npremium could be around 0.5-1.2% per annum. This is indicative only and will \nneed to be adjusted in the light of market sentiments during implementation. \nPremiums collected will be deposited into an escrow account, which will be used \nfirst to reimburse ADB for its guarantee fees and for agreed upon management \nand administrative expenses, including external parties, then the Government \nfor any agreed upon out-of-pocket expenses, and the balance will be retained to \nbuild a claims reserve over time. \nADB Fees and  For each PRG issued under the facility, ADB will charge at the time of issuance \nAdministration  and prior to effectiveness of the PRG a front end fee of up to 1% in line with the \nCharges:  provisions in ADB\u2019s policies on guarantee operations. \nFor outstanding PRGs up to the ADB limit that are counterguaranteed, ADB will \ncharge an ADB guarantee fee at the rate of 0.40% per annum on the covered \namounts, calculated on a daily basis and payable periodically in arrears. \nExpenses incurred by external parties related to the establishment of the facility \nand its administration, including legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses, will be \npaid out of the premium income generated by the facility during utilization. Up-\nfront fees may be financed out of disbursement proceeds from the FMGP loan \nas  agreed  upon  with  the  Government,  and  be  recovered  through  premium \nincome as it arises.  \nFor guarantees in excess of the ADB limit, the private sector PRI providers \nunder  the  CGP  will  determine  and  charge  premium  consistent  with  market \npractice.  In  line  with  the  ADB  PRG  Review  Paper,  ADB  will  charge  an \narrangement and administrative fee for making the CGP available. \nA fee may also be paid to any facility agent appointed for establishing and \nmanaging day-to-day operations of the facility.  \nImplementation  ADB may appoint a facility or management agent to administer the facility or \nStructure and  individual PRGs on behalf of ADB in accordance with sound commercial and \nLegal  international best practices for governance, management, and underwriting as \nDocumentation:  set forth under a guarantee management agreement.  The agent may enter on \n  behalf  of  ADB  (or  other  PRI  providers  under  the  CGP)  into  a  master  risk \nparticipation agreement (MRPA) with each PFI. \n ", "    Appendix 10  65\nThe agent may (i) arrange and manage the MRPAs; (ii) receive all notifications \nissued by PFIs; (iii) collect all premiums from the PFIs and operate the PRG \naccount; (iv) receive any demand made by the PFIs under an MRPA, which will \nbe  immediately  sent  to  ADB  and  the  Government;  (v)  provide  quarterly \nstatements showing ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s liabilities under each MRPA \nand the total facility; and (vi) do other things required to administer and promote \nthe PRG facility.  \nThe agent will be an experienced and trustworthy financial institution or private \nsector PRI provider, and will be selected by ADB in a transparent manner \nfollowing normal commercial practice. The agent will ideally be domiciled in an \ninternational financial center having close proximity to investors interested in \nPakistan. \nADB will also enter into a counterguarantee agreement with the Government. \nSchedule and  The  facility  will  become  effective  after  finalization  of  legal  agreements  and \nAvailability  identification of an initial PRG transaction, expected within 6 months after ADB \nPeriod:  Board approval. \nThe facility will be available for a period of 4 years from the effective date of the \nfacility. During the availability period, a PFI may increase cover amounts subject \nto overall availability, and new PRGs may be issued.  \nIndividual PRGs issued under the facility may have a maximum term of 10 \nyears. \nCancellation:  ADB may, after consultation with the Government, and prior notice to PFIs, \ncancel any uncommitted portion of the facility if it is determined that it is no \nlonger required. \nA PFI may reduce the cover amount or cancel a PRG at any time after a PRG is \nissued, with prior notice given to ADB. \nMarket  During the term of the facility, ADB and the agent will actively seek to encourage \nCollaboration  both  public  and  private  sector  PRI  providers  to  participate  in  the  facility, \nand Exit  especially as demand grows.  \nStrategy: \nThe agent, on behalf of and if requested by ADB, may also arrange parallel \ncounterguarantees from private sector PRI providers for individual PRGs, issued \nunder the facility, to further leverage or improve the risk profile of the facility. \nOver time it is envisioned that the share of private PRI providers extending \ncover under the facility will increase, and the share covered under the ADB limit \nwith government counterguarantee will correspondingly decline.   \n \n \n   ", "66  Appendix 11 \n \nPOLITICAL RISK GUARANTEE FACILITY FOR \nENHANCING ACCESS TO COVER FOR SELECTED VIOLENCE-RELATED RISKS  \n  \n \nA.  Background and Rationale \n \n1.  The terrorist attacks in the United States (US) on 11 September 2001 have accelerated \nthe hardening of insurance and reinsurance markets worldwide and caused a major reduction in, \nand in some cases complete disappearance of, international insurance and reinsurance capacity \nfor property, casualty, and other forms of insurance in developing countries. For what little \ncapacity that is left, much higher rates and very restricted terms are demanded. The difficulty is \nexacerbated by the low capitalization of insurers in many of these countries, which magnifies \ntheir dependence on international reinsurance markets.  Without reinsurance cover, primary \ninsurance  companies  are  unable  to  offer  comprehensive  insurance  for  risks  in  developing \ncountries, or can do so only very sparingly. This shortage has been aggravated further, as cover \nfor terrorism and related risks, which was in the past routinely included in general insurance \npolicies, is now explicitly excluded.  \n \n2.  In particular, airlines and project sponsors for large investments are now finding it difficult \nto obtain or renew insurance cover for a variety of risks. Cover for terrorism and sabotage risks \nis among the hardest to get. In Pakistan the exposed investments include the national airline \nand a number of vital existing infrastructure projects, including projects supported by multilateral \nand  bilateral  institutions.  In  addition,  affordable  investment  capital  from  both  domestic  and \nforeign  sources  for  new  high-profile  strategic  projects  and  the  privatization  of  certain \nGovernment-owned enterprises in Pakistan may be in jeopardy unless primary insurers (backed \nby their reinsurers) are willing and capable of offering comprehensive and reasonably priced \ninsurance \u2013 inclusive of terrorism and sabotage cover. The lack of adequate and comprehensive \ninsurance cover, including political violence and terrorism risk, also undermines financial sector \nsoundness, as many assets that are pledged as collateral against syndicated loans or bond \nissues are no longer fully insured.  \n \n3.  Some  commercial  insurance  companies  have  responded  to  the  changed  industry \nscenario and are now offering stand-alone terrorism insurance products. However, underwriting \ncapacity in this regard is very limited, policies are restrictive, and they are limited to a select few \npolicyholders  and  generally  beyond  reach  for  emerging  markets.  Governments  in  many \nEuropean countries and the US have thus taken various initiatives to help the insurance market \novercome this situation, which is generally perceived as a temporary market failure until more \nprivate  capacity  has  been  established.1  In  this  context,  government  generally  serves  two \nfunctions, to overcome capacity shortage and to act as insurer of last resort. \n \n4.  The Government of Pakistan has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to assist \nit in addressing key industry concerns and ensuring continued access by Pakistan companies to \ncomprehensive  insurance  and  reinsurance.  This  assistance  can  be  achieved  through  the \ninnovative  application  of  ADB\u2019s  political  risk  guarantee  (PRG)  instrument  in  the  form  of  a \nrevolving PRG facility.2 Specifically, ADB would issue individual PRGs under the facility that \n                                                 \n1\n  A report issued in March 2002  by Swiss Re, a leading re-insurance company, estimates that it could take 3 to 5 \nyears for the private insurance industry to develop means to cover terrorism. \n2\n The 2000 PRG Review Paper establishes the policy framework for political risk guarantees, which conditionally \nguarantee a variety of political risks including acts of \u201cpolitical violence\u201d. Because conditional guarantees contain \ncharacteristics similar to insurance, and because ADB\u2019s conditional guarantee may be used to co-guarantee cover \nprovided by commercial PRI providers, insurance and guarantee terms and concepts may be used interchangeably. \n ", "    Appendix 11  67\nguarantee payment of a certain amount to a guaranteed party, normally a company, in case \nterrorism or other political violence risk as specified under the PRG policy occurs. This payment \nwill  permit  the  guaranteed  party  to  maintain  its  operations  and  thus  continue  servicing  its \nfinancial  obligations  to  its  lenders  in  the  case  of  an  existing  enterprise,  or  support  the \nguaranteed  party  to  attract  debt  financing  in  case  of  a  new  enterprise.3  ADB  will  be \ncounterindemnified by the Government. Thus ADB will facilitate the provision of risk retention \ncapacity that is ultimately made available by the Government, or commercial reinsurers, and \ncredit enhance the collateral pledged by enterprises to its lenders.  \n \nB.  Objective, Scope, and Basic Principles \n \n5.  The principal objective of the proposed PRG facility is to establish a mechanism that \nassists in protecting Pakistan\u2019s economy and financial system from the negative economic fall-\nout  associated  with  noncommercial  risks,  in  particular  terrorism  and  other  acts  of  political \nviolence for which cover is no longer readily available after the events of 11 September 2001. \nThis  will  enable  vital  investments  and  infrastructure  projects  in  Pakistan  to  be  insured \ncomprehensively and help maintain their financial sustainability, thereby protecting the lenders \nto such projects. Subsidiary benefits may arise through enhancement of the retention capacity of \nthe Pakistan insurance market, mobilization of additional international capacity, and arbitrage in \nreinsurance rates for the selected risks covered through the intermediary power of the proposed \nPRG facility. \n \n6.  The Government will ultimately and implicitly provide some underwriting capacity for the \nterrorism and other political violence risks covered under the PRG facility. ADB will guarantee \nthat  this  capacity  be  made  available  in  a  claim  event,  thereby  enhancing  international \nacceptance of the Government\u2019s initiative. In case of a claim, ADB may, at the request of the \nGovernment  and  at  its  sole  discretion,  opt  to  finance  any  payouts  owed  under  the \ncounterguarantee, thereby spreading the fiscal impact of a claim over a number of years. ADB \nwill also seek to leverage the capacity provided, enhanced through the PRG, in the international \nreinsurance market to obtain additional cover at competitive rates.  \n \n7.  PRGs under the facility will be issued on a case-by-case basis to support agreed upon \ninvestments and infrastructure projects that have been subject to due diligence. The PRG facility \nwill be administered by a facility agent, which will be an experienced private sector PRI broker or \nprovider, or other trustworthy financial institution. The PRG facility will build on the previous \nexperience gained by ADB in implementation of similar vehicles including the PRG Facility for \nLetter of Credit Confirmations under the Small and Medium Enterprise Trade Enhancement \nFinance Project, which was made effective in September 2001.  \n \nC.  Major Terms, Conditions, and Arrangements of the Proposed PRG Facility \n \nFacility:  A revolving PRG facility with counterguarantee from the Government of Pakistan \nto  cover  political  violence  risk,  including  terrorism  and  sabotage,  for  which \ninsurance in Pakistan is not readily available. Under the facility, ADB will issue \nindividual  PRGs  from  time  to  time  and  on  a  case-by-case  basis  after  due \ndiligence to \n                                                 \n3\n  It should be noted that under its Charter and policies, ADB\u2019s guarantee operations are intended to cover repayment \nobligations to credit providers. The proposed PRG will credit enhance the collateral that is pledged against debt \nobligations. Therefore, the amount of individual PRGs issued under the proposed facility to cover specified violence \nevents will be limited to the amount of outstanding debt of the enterprise covered, and the PRG may be assigned to \nspecific lenders. \n   ", "68  Appendix 11 \n \n\u2022  sponsors or owners of approved investments and projects, alongside other \ncoguarantors or primary insurers; and/or \n\u2022  guarantors or primary insurers of approved investments and projects, to \ncounterguarantee their guarantee or insurance in favor of the investment \nand/or project.  \nGuaranteed  Ultimate beneficiaries of a PRG will be Pakistan or international enterprises, and \nBeneficiaries  their lenders.  \nand \nThe primary beneficiary may be a Pakistani or international enterprise, or when a \nInvestments: \nPRG is issued to counterguarantee a guarantee or insurance contract issued by \na guarantor or primary insurer, such guarantor or primary insurer may be the \n \nprimary beneficiary. \nInvestments eligible for cover under a PRG include new and existing assets of \nvital economic importance located in Pakistan, as agreed upon between ADB \nand the Government from time to time.  \nGuaranteed  Loss as a result of a political violence event, including terrorism and sabotage, \nRisks:  as agreed upon with the Government and defined in the PRG documentation. \nIn any event, ADB will not guarantee, indemnify, or cover loss as a result of any \ncommercial or other market-related risk. \nGuarantor:  ADB will be the sole guarantor, backed by its ordinary capital resources, up to \naggregate liabilities under the facility of $175 million.   \nCounter- The Government of Pakistan will provide a counterguarantee and indemnity to \nguarantor:  ADB for all amounts owed under the each PRG provided under the facility, so \nthat ADB\u2019s exposure will always be counterguaranteed. \nAfter the occurrence of a guaranteed event, should the Government so request, \nADB  may  at  its  sole  discretion  convert  any  outstanding  counterguarantee \nobligation into a loan to Pakistan to finance the cost of the claim. \nFacility Limit:  The aggregate liability under all PRGs issued under the facility will not exceed \n$175 million equivalent. \nThe total facility limit can be increased through participation of coguarantors. \nThe facility limit is based on estimated initial demand. Due to the revolving \nnature of the facility, actual utilization of limits is expected to fluctuate over time \nin  line  with  changing  risk  perceptions  and  development  of  private  sector \nalternatives over time. \nMaximum Limit  ADB  and  the  Government,  in  consultation  with  the  market,  will  agree  to \nof Liability per  guidelines that will specify the deductible and limit of indemnity for each PRG, \nPRG Issued:  taking into consideration the risks covered and other factors.

This is indicative \nonly and will need to be adjusted periodically in the light of market sentiments \nduring implementation. \nPremiums collected will be deposited into an escrow account, which will be used \nfirst to reimburse ADB for its guarantee fees and for agreed upon management \nand administrative expenses, including external parties, then the Government for \nany agreed upon out-of-pocket expenses, and the balance will be retained to \nbuild a claims reserve over time. \nADB Fees and  For each PRG issued under the facility, ADB will charge at the time of issuance \nAdministration  and prior to effectiveness of the PRG a front end fee of up to 1% in line with the \nCharges:  provisions in ADB\u2019s policies on guarantee operations. \nFor each PRG issued under the facility, ADB will charge an ADB guarantee fee \nat the rate of 0.40% per annum on the covered amounts, calculated on a daily \nbasis and payable periodically in arrears.  \nExpenses incurred by external parties related to the establishment of the facility \nand its administration, including legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses, will be \npaid out the premium income generated by the facility during utilization. Up-front \nfees  may  be  financed  out  of  disbursement  proceeds  from  the  Financial \n(Nonbank) Markets and Governance Program loan as agreed upon with the \nGovernment and be recovered through premium income as it arises.  \nA fee may also be paid to any facility agent appointed for establishing and \nmanaging day-to-day operations of the facility. \nImplementation  ADB will appoint as facility or management agent an experienced private sector \nStructure and  political risk insurance (PRI) broker or provider or other trustworthy financial \nLegal  institution to operate the facility on behalf of ADB, in accordance with sound \nAgreements:  commercial and international best practices for underwriting management and \ngovernance, as set forth under a facility agent management agreement.  \n \nThe agent will (i) issue individual PRGs within agreed upon limits on behalf of \nADB after due diligence and concurrence by ADB; (ii) collect all premiums and \noperate the PRG account; (iii) receive all notifications and any demand made \nunder a PRG, which will be immediately sent to ADB and the Government; (iv) \nprovide periodic statements showing ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s liability under \n   ", "70  Appendix 11 \n \neach PRG and the total facility; and (v) do other things required to administer \nand promote the PRG facility.  \nThe agent will be selected by ADB in close collaboration with the Government \nand appropriate representatives of the insurance industry in Pakistan.

Many of these functions cannot be fulfilled by Pakistan\u2019s inefficient banking sector but \nrequire the development of other nonbank financial products and services, including long-term finance.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Growth \nAnalysis: \nThe Financial (Nonbank) Markets and Governance Program is indirectly pro-poor in supporting the three \ncomponents  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy:  pro-poor  sustainable  economic  growth,  good \ngovernance, and social development. \nPro-poor sustainable economic growth is to be achieved through the program focus on measures to \nincrease investor confidence and restore the flow of much-needed investment capital to Pakistan. This, in \nturn, will provide employment fpr Pakistan\u2019s rapidly growing population and raise the real wages of the \nworking poor. To support good governance, the Program will induce transparency and information \ndisclosure to ensure more sustainable economic management and protection of minority interests. It will \nimprove governance of the financial market and the corporate sector through more effective market \nregulation, restructuring of key participants including the stock exchanges, and improved transparency of \nthe quality and quantity of reported and audited financial statements. In addition, the Program will support \nbetter fiscal management through rationalization of distortions related to taxation policy and reduction of \nreliance on inherently volatile revenue from financial markets. The Program will also support the poverty \nreduction strategy\u2019s third pillar of social development. Providing basic infrastructure and services such as \nwater or electricity requires investment with long-term payback horizons, which can be supported through \ncapital markets, in particular if private sector involvement is sought. At the same time, the development of \nsocial protection programs such as pensions and other insurance schemes requires long-term investment \nopportunities, which are provided in particular by capital markets. \n \nC.
