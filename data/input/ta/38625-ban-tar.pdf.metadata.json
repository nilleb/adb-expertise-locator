Introduction  \n \n1.  The Board approved Loan 2156-BAN(SF): Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation \nProject (the Project) for Special Drawings Rights 117,195,000 ($180.00 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on 20 January 2005 to finance emergency flood damage \nrehabilitation in Bangladesh. Loan 2156-BAN(SF) became effective on 2 May 2005; the loan \nclosing date is 31 July 2007. The Project has five major components (i) rural infrastructure, (ii) \nroads,  (iii)  railways,  (iv)  water  resources,  and  (v)  municipal  infrastructure.  The  Project  is \nfinanced  with  $180  million  equivalent  from  ADB  and  $60  million  equivalent  from  the \nGovernment. This paper seeks approval by the Board of a major change in project scope and \nimplementation  arrangements  due  to  grant  funding  provided  by  the  Governments  of  the \nNetherlands and Sweden. \n     \nII.  Background \n \n2.  During preparation of the Project, the Government of the Netherlands and Sweden \nthrough Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), expressed interest in \nproviding about $25 million cofinancing for the Project. The ADB loan was approved on the \nbasis  that  ADB  will  provide  its  loan  under  an  umbrella  or  standby  financing  mechanism, \nwhereby ADB commits for an $180 million loan but cancels a portion of its loan when grant \nfinancing becomes available from the Netherlands and/or Sweden. Similarly, the piggy-backed \nTA 4562-BAN: Early Warning Systems Study (the TA) for $250,000 financed under ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program was approved on the basis that it will be replaced by a corresponding grant \nfrom  the  Government  of  Netherlands  when  such  financing  becomes  available  and  be \nadministrated by ADB.  \n   \n3.  The  Project  is  being  implemented  by  four  executing  agencies  (i)  Part  A:  rural \ninfrastructure \u2013 Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), (ii) Part B: roads \u2013 Roads \nand Highways Department (RHD), (iii) Part C: railways \u2013 Bangladesh Railway (BR), (iv) Part D: \nwater resources \u2013 Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), and (v) Part E: municipal \ninfrastructure - LGED. Project implementation is progressing well according to schedule and \nagreements and there are no major issues or problems. As of 30 September 2005, overall \nprogress of project completion was 25% and contracts awarded amounted to $83.5 million while \ndisbursements amounted to $14.7 million.  \n \nIII.  The Proposed Changes \n \n4.      The Government of the Netherlands has advised ADB on its approval of a grant in the \namount of Euro 10.79 million ($13 million equivalent) for the water resources component (Part D \nof the Project), and another grant in the amount of $250,000 equivalent covering the entire \npiggy-backed TA 4562: Early Warning Systems Study. Similarly, the Government of Sweden \nhas advised ADB on its approval of a grant in the amount of SEK 120 million ($14.7 million \nequivalent) for the rural infrastructure component (Part A of the Project). Both the Government \nof the Netherlands and Sweden have requested ADB to administer these grants on their behalf ", "2 \nin accordance with the agreements on cofinancing between the Government of the Netherlands \nand ADB, and the Government of Sweden and ADB, respectively.  \n \n5.  For Part D of the Project, the total cost is $42.8 million equivalent. Under the proposed \nchange in financing plan, $13 million equivalent would be financed by the Government of the \nNetherlands to cover a portion of the cost of civil works, $18.83 million equivalent by ADB to \ncover a portion of the cost of civil works and consultants and the remainder by the Government \nof Bangladesh.  \n \n6.  The total cost for Part A of the Project is $73.9 million equivalent. Under the proposed \nchange in financing plan,  $14.7 million equivalent would be financed by the Government of \nSweden to cover a portion of the cost of civil works, $40.5 million equivalent by ADB to cover a \nportion of the cost of civil works and consultants, and the remainder by the Government of \nBangladesh.  \n \nIV.   Assessment \n \n7.  Given the flexible project design and its implementation arrangements, cofinancing can \nbe accommodated without any delay. There would be no change in project goal, objectives, or \nachievement of targets and outputs under the Project. The Government will benefit from lower \nfinancing cost for the Project. The change of scope of the Project will enable return of $27.7 \nmillion to ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The change will strengthen ADB\u2019s cooperation with \nbilateral development partners active in Bangladesh.    \n   \nV.  The President\u2019s Recommendation \n \n8.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  proposed  change  in  the \nfinancing plan and ADB administering   \n \n(i)  the  funds  in  the  amount  equivalent  to  $13  million  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of the Netherlands on a grant basis for financing Part D of the \nProject; and   \n(ii)  the  funds  in  the  amount  equivalent  to  $14.7  million  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of Sweden on a grant basis for financing Part A of the Project. \n \n9.  If the Board approves the proposed changes, the corresponding portions of the loan \nproceeds,  allocated  for  category  civil  works  under  Parts  A  and  D  of  the  Projects  will  be \nsubsequently cancelled.  \n \n       \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20051123160358+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20051025135703+08'00'", "Title": "Loan 2156-BAN(SF): Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project Major Change in Project Scope and Implementation Arrangements Due to Grant Funding Provided by the Governments of the Netherlands and Sweden", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
