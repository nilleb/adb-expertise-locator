The Government of Nepal requested the assistance of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to support the improvement of the east\u2013west highway (EWH). The project will rehabilitate \nand upgrade the capacity, quality, and safety of about 87 kilometers (km) of the EWH between \nKanchanpur and Kamala in southeastern Nepal. The EWH is the main domestic and international \ntrade corridor of Nepal and forms part of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \nand South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) corridor 4, linking Kathmandu to \nDhaka and Chittagong through India.1  \n \n2.  The  project  will  promote  economic  growth  and  contribute  to  enhancing  the \ncompetitiveness of Nepal\u2019s exporting industries by (i) improving interprovincial, national, and \nregional connectivity; (ii) providing greater access to social services, markets, and employment \nopportunities; (iii) supporting the development of the agriculture, industry, energy, and tourism \nsectors; and (iv) easing growing traffic congestion. The project will be supported by attached \ntechnical assistance (TA) that will improve road safety, road maintenance, gender equality and \nsocial inclusion (GESI) on the 1,027 km-long EWH corridor, and strengthen the capacity of the \nexecuting and implementing agencies in road safety and road maintenance.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Road safety. While vehicle ownership in Nepal remains comparatively low, with only 0.08 \nvehicles per capita, vehicles sales have increased at an annual rate of 20.1% during FY2007\u2013\nFY2017, with the number of registered vehicles expected to quadruple by 2027.2 The growth in \nvehicle ownership is primarily driven by motorcycles, which account for 79.6% of all vehicles but \nincrease road safety concerns. The number of recorded accidents increased from about 3,800 in \nFY2002 to 13,580 in FY2013 (an average annual growth rate of 12.3%), while recorded fatalities \nincreased from 879 in FY2002 to 2,385 in FY2017 (an average annual growth rate of 6.8%).3 \nTraffic fatalities are estimated at 302 fatalities per 100,000 vehicles\u2014one of the highest rates in \nAsia.4 In response, the government prepared a Road Safety Action Plan (2013\u20132020) aligned \nwith the five pillars of road safety identified by the United Nations: (i) improved road safety \nmanagement, (ii) safer roads and mobility, (iii) safer vehicles, (iv) safer users, and (v) improved \npost-crash response.5 The road safety action plan lacks a safety policy, and needs to be updated \nand complemented by a specific investment plan. \n \n4.  The EWH connects the eastern and western borders of Nepal with India, and is the main \ndomestic and international trade corridor of Nepal. It provides a vital link to major economic \ncenters and neighboring countries, and carries the highest traffic volumes in the country. On the \nmajority of its length, the EWH has a two-lane design with an undivided median, and does not \nsegregate slow-moving vehicles and pedestrians in urban sections. The traffic mix features a \nvariety of road users, including motorcycles, freight vehicles, private cars, light goods vehicles, \n                                                \n1  SAARC Secretariat. 2006.

Gender equality and  social inclusion. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and \nTransport (MOPIT) executes sector programs in the strategic roads, railways and transport \nmanagement sectors through its three departments, Department of Roads (DOR), Department of \nRailways (DORW), and Department of Transport Management (DOTM). A review of MOPIT\u2019s \nGESI policies, institutional structures, programs, budgets and monitoring practices indicated that \nthese sectors had not adequately incorporated GESI and other social development concerns, and \nrequired practical guidance to address GESI issues. With ADB support, MOPIT subsequently \ndeveloped operational guidelines for mainstreaming and institutionalizing GESI in its portfolio and \noperations, which were finalized in 2017 and launched in March 2018.6 The TA will further support \nthe review of the institutional framework required for implementation of the GESI operational \nguidelines through a range of capacity development initiatives targeting all divisions, branches \nand sections of MOPIT, DOR, DORW, and DOTM. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s intervention. The proposed project will address infrastructure bottlenecks in \nsoutheastern Nepal. The proposed transaction TA will complement infrastructure improvements \nby supporting capacity building and institutional strengthening of MOPIT and its departments, and \nfacilitating the preparation and implementation of road safety and GESI activities. The TA will \nimplement the following key activities: (i) review of institutional arrangements related to road \nsafety, (ii) preparation of a national road safety policy, of a road safety strategy for 2021\u20132030, \nand of an investment plan for 2021\u20132023; (iii) the strengthening of the road safety council \ncomprising DOR, DOTM, Nepal Traffic Police, Roads Board Nepal (RBN), and other relevant \nagencies; (iii) the review and formulation of recommendations regarding a suitable road safety \nassessment framework; (iv) the preparation and implementation of a road safety assessment for \n1,027 km of the EWH to mitigate accident blackspots, in coordination with project preparatory \nconsultants  engaged  under  the  loan;  (v)  a  road  safety  campaign  along  the  EWH;  (vi)  a \nprefeasibility study to identify and design service areas along the EWH; (vii) a review of the \ninstitutional  arrangements  required  for  the  implementation  of  GESI  guidelines  across  the \ndepartments of MOPIT; (viii) the dissemination of GESI operational guidelines within MOPIT; and \n(ix) capacity strengthening of MOPIT, DOR, DORW, and DOTM in road safety and GESI.  \n \n7.  Technical assistance modality. The transaction TA has been prepared at the request of \nMOPIT, which sought the assistance of ADB to increase the capacity of DOR and other agencies \nin road safety and GESI, and support the preparation and implementation of road safety projects \non the EWH. The TA objectives, scope, and implementation arrangements were defined by \nMOPIT and ADB. Use of the TA modality is proposed, rather than a loan subcomponent, to (i) \ncontinue the long-term partnership of the government and ADB on policy dialogue and capacity \ndevelopment, (ii) strengthen the capacity of MOPIT and DOR with regard to identified knowledge \nand  management  gaps,  (iii)  increase  cross-agency  cooperation,  and  (iv)  enhance  project \nmonitoring and improve the likelihood of achieving the proposed outputs and outcome. The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan 2018\u20132020 for Nepal.7 \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n6 MOPIT. 2017.
