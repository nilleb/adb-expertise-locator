The Government of Kazakhstan (the Government) has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to prepare a regional rural development project. The TA, \nwhich  is  included  in  the  Government\u2019s  program  and  ADB\u2019s  country  assistance  strategy  and \nprogram for 2003, will assist the Government to prepare an investment project to develop selected \nareas in support of the Government\u2019s designation of 2003\u20132005 as the \u201cYears of Rural Revival.\u201d \nADB has provided initial assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) through a small-scale TA.1 \nIn December 2002 an MOA proposal formed the basis for a draft memorandum of understanding \n(MOU). Comments were received by ADB from MOA in April 2003. The TA Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited Kazakhstan from 12 to 23 May 2003 for further discussions and to reach agreement on a \nmutual  course  of  action.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  the  mission  and  the \nunderstandings  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  goal,  purpose,  scope,  implementation \narrangements, cost estimates, and terms of reference for the TA.2 A preliminary project framework \nis found in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Since 1991, Kazakhstan has pursued a vigorous reform program aimed at transforming \ninto a market economy. The reforms have encompassed a wide range of initiatives, including farm \nprivatization, rural enterprise restructuring, liberalization of farm input and output prices, and \nreduced  trade  restrictions  on  agriculture  products.  Kazakhstan  has  recently  strengthened  its \nmacroeconomic performance, including increased fiscal revenues. Despite increases in fiscal \nrevenues from the oil sector there has not been a substantial increase in expenditure. Budget \nsurpluses in 2001 and 2002 are expected to continue in 2003. The rising oil revenues are yet to \nbenefit the majority of the population, particularly in rural areas. While investment in agriculture \nhas remained low at 1.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) during 1999\u20132001, the 2003 budget is \nexpected to increase expenditure in rural areas. \n  \n3.  The agriculture sector remains at high risk and low profitability. Its share in GDP is about \n8.5% and is unlikely to change significantly in the short term primarily because of increasing oil \nand  gas  revenues,  limited  domestic  market,  instability  of  external  markets,  and  weak \ncompetitiveness  of  products  due  to  high  transport  costs  and  obsolete  technology.  Rural \nunemployment and underemployment are widespread, rural poverty incidence is 38% (2001), and \nfamilies continue to vacate rural settlements and company towns. \n \n4.  The  Government\u2019s  2030  Strategy3  outlines  a  long-term  goal  to  improve  rural  living \nstandards with a narrowing gap between the rural and urban populations. The Government\u2019s \nstrategy until 20104 aims at doubling Kazakhstan\u2019s GDP by 2010 and sustaining long-term growth \nin  rural  living  standards  principally  by  fostering  a  competitive  agriculture  sector.  The  State \nAgrofood  Program5  aims  to  ensure  food  security  by  establishing  an  efficient  agro-industrial \ncomplex producing competitive finished products. \n \n5.  In April 2002, the President announced the period 2003\u20132005 as the \u201cYears of Rural \nRevival.\u201d  The  Government  agencies  were  directed  to  formulate  policies,  including  financial, \n                                                 \n1\n ADB. 2002.

", "2 \neconomic, social, and agricultural, to support the development of rural settlements in areas with \npotential  for  long-term  income  and  employment  growth  under  a  market  economy.  The \ndevelopment of these areas is also intended to attract migration of communities out of regions with \nlimited prospects for economic development or environmentally hazardous areas. In June 2002, \nMOA was assigned to formulate a strategy for this rural settlement development. \n \n6.  ADB assisted MOA with a TA (footnote 1) to support the development of a methodology to \nscreen and classify 160 districts in 14 oblasts (regions) according to their growth potential and \nconstraints to realizing that potential. The TA was successful and MOA adopted the methodology \nto further classify districts and settlements as part of the National Rural Development Programme \n(NRDP).6 \n \n7.  MOA  initiated  a  \u201cpassportization\u201d  survey  in  December  2002,  collecting  data  on  81 \ndemographic, economic, social, and environmental variables in all 7,660 rural settlements. The \nmethodology  and  initial  classification  into  settlements  with  high,  medium,  weak,  and  no \ndevelopment potential was discussed with oblasts and rural settlements on 27 February 2003. In \nparallel, MOA adopted a bottom-up approach to identifying measures to address economic and \nsocial  infrastructure  and  environmental  mitigation  needs  of  settlements.  The  lists  were \nprogressively aggregated and screened at district and oblast level. The NRDP comprising the \nclassification and proposed measures was circulated to ministries and agencies on 7 April for \nreview and comment. The final NRDP program was approved by the Government in July 2003, \nincluding a budget of T67.5 billion (about $450 million) for 2004\u20132006. \n \n8.  In addition to the NRDP, there are other programs for the revival and development of \nagriculture and rural areas, the key objective of the social and economic policy of the Government \nas stated in the President\u2019s Address to the Nation on 4 April 2003. These include: Small Towns \nDevelopment; Programme of Industrial and Innovative Development to 2015; Program on Poverty \n2003\u20132005; Rural Schools Program 2003\u20132005; Sector Drinking Water Program 2003\u20132010; and \na proposed Rural Roads Development Program.  Moreover, the state government system is to be \nmodernized with a broadening of authority of local governments in resolving issues of territorial \ndevelopment  and  ensuring  effective  management  at  lower  levels,  and  by  improving \nintergovernmental budget relations. This is to include a clear delineation of functions between \nlevels of government, a corresponding budget responsibility, and further institutionalization and \nstrengthening of local governments as part of an ongoing democratization and decentralization \nprocess. \n  \n9.  The preparation of NRDP, other programs, and the modernization of the state government \nsystem provides the opportunity for the Government to undertake a more holistic approach to \naddressing the needs of rural areas. As well as the vertical integration of the current programs, \nfurther horizontal integration that combines all programs with changes in government functions \nand budget authority and responsibility will provide an effective integrated regional development \nperspective. The changes in planning and intergovernmental and budgetary relationships are \nintroducing  a  higher  level  of  complexity  for  local  governments  at  the  same  time  they  are \nintroducing a basis for regional and rural planning, which will require institutional adjustments and \nenhancements for effective implementation.  \n \n10.  The Government has embarked on an essential adaptation program to successfully design \nand implement strategies and measures that allow the struggling rural areas to thrive in a market \neconomy.  This  adaptation  process  entails  measures  to  stimulate  economic  growth  and  the \n                                                 \n6\n  Government of Kazakhstan. 2003.

Specifically, for rural areas expected to absorb internal migration, the \nGovernment wishes to anticipate the size and spatial distribution of rural settlements (optimal rural \nsettlement model).7 This is being done to determine an appropriate land use plan, physical and \nsocial infrastructure demand, and social protection measures needed to ease the transition. \n \n11.  To strengthen the support for such an adaptation program, a regional rural development \nframework would facilitate the design of programs and projects within a sufficiently wide spatial \ncontext of market systems, service systems, and ecological systems. To bring the Government\u2019s \ngoal of rural economic recovery to its full realization, the following initiatives are urgently required \n(i)  an  assessment  of  the  capacity  and  requirements  for  regional  and  rural  planning  and \nintergovernmental relations; (ii) development of appropriate regional and rural development plans \nat  the  district  and  oblast  levels,  and  (iii)  identification  of  priority  public  investments  and \nopportunities and potential for private sector investments. A pilot exercise in one or two oblasts is \nneeded to explore appropriate ways of planning that will maximize the value of investments and \nthe potential growth of rural areas. The TA will prepare a detailed feasibility study for a future \ninvestment project. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The objective of the TA is to prepare a feasibility study in selected pilot areas for a \nplanning  and  investment  program  that  enables  oblasts  and  districts  to  plan  and  implement \nintegrated development measures in accordance with their roles and functions. The envisaged \nproject is expected to commence in 2004.   \n \n13.  The TA will be divided into two phases, with the following key outputs envisaged. Phase I \n(3 months) will involve an assessment, recommendations, and guidelines for regional planning, \nprimarily at oblast and district level, and will include (i) the integration and refinement of a national \nregional development framework and regional planning process guidelines for the preparation of \noblast/district  regional  plans;  (ii)  an  institutional  assessment  for  regional  and  rural  planning, \nincluding an assessment of capacity building needs, encompassing national framework policy and \nlegislation,  organizational  aspects,  and  human  resource  development  requirements  (the \nassessment and key recommendations will be documented); (iii) the adaptation of international \ngood  practices  and  tools  for  regional  planning, particularly  the  forecast  and management  of \ninternal migration flows and the modeling of rural settlement development; and (iv) a report and \nnational workshop recommendations on phase I findings and recommendations and review of \nphase II outputs and activities.  \n \n14.  Assuming successful implementation of phase I, phase II, over a 5\u2013month period, will \nfocus on applying the planning process and tools to the preparation of regional plans and an \nagreed  investment  project  for  funding  by  ADB  as  follows:  (i)  refined  regional  planning  tools \nthrough their application in pilot oblast(s) and districts; (ii) draft regional plans for pilot oblast(s) \nand districts, addressing key economic and social challenges and opportunities, and a monitoring \nframework (indicators and monitoring mechanisms); (iii) an investment project design for possible \n                                                 \n7\n  This term is used in NRDP but is not defined. It seems to mean a rationalization or efficient distribution of rural \nsettlements and populations and provision of an appropriate level of economic and social infrastructure and services.  ", "4 \nADB financing to overcome critical constraints facing rural development, taking into consideration \nthe  potential  financial,  institutional,  environmental,  and  social  impacts  of  the  proposed \ninvestment(s); and (iv) a common understanding among concerned stakeholders at the national \nand local levels on the objectives, scope, and implementation arrangements of the proposed \nproject. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented in a process approach and will build on the Government\u2019s \ninitiative in participatory bottom-up planning in the preparation of the NRDP. To achieve a more \nintegrated  regional  planning  perspective,  participation  will  be  both  horizontal  and  vertical. \nHorizontal participation will be conducted through the TA steering committee, technical working \ngroup, oblast/district level working groups, stakeholder workshops, and community groups to \nensure cross sectoral interests and inter-district interests are addressed. The role of the oblast \nand district councils will be given particular attention and the intermediation groups (such as non-\ngovernment  and  other  community-based  organizations)  that  are  advocating  rural  issues  and \nworking  with  rural  communities  will  be  closely  involved.  Vertical  integration  will  be  achieved \nthrough close cooperation and coordination between staff in MOA and the pilot oblast(s)/districts \nand communities. The preparation of the draft regional plans will be of a participatory nature \ninvolving  planning  and  analysis  tools,  such  as  participatory  rural  appraisal,  and  an  iterative \nprocess from community to national level in identifying and prioritizing needs and measures.   \n \n16.  The activities under phase I will include (i) a review of the existing national level studies \nrelating  to  various  agricultural  and  rural  development  programs,  policy  and  legislation,  and \ngovernment functions and responsibilities and related financial authority (including the legislative \nframework governing the management of internal migration); (ii) a review of the existing planning \nframework and processes; (iii) development of selection criteria and agreement to the choice of \none or two oblasts; (iv) meetings and group discussions with oblast- and district-level staff to \nassess  institutional  arrangements  and  capacity  and  make  recommendations  for  their \nenhancement; (v) presentation of available tools for regional planning to national-, oblast-, and \ndistrict-level  staff  to  discuss  their  appropriateness  and  means  of  adaptation  to  the  regional \nplanning environment; (vi) preparation of the findings and recommendations for discussion with \nthe  project  steering  committee  and  ADB;  and  (vii)  the  conduct  of  a  national  workshop  for \nstakeholders to present results and review phase II outputs and activities. \n \n17.  The activities in phase II will include (i) basic training of relevant national and pilot oblast \nand  district  staff  in  regional  planning  processes  and  tools  through  training  workshops  and \nprogressive on the job application of tools to the preparation of regional plans; (ii) the revision of \nregional  planning  guidelines  identified  through  the  course  of  preparing  regional  plans;  (iii) \nidentification of priority projects for external funding; (iv) design of an investment project including \ntechnical design, environmental analysis, financial and economic analyses, institutional analysis, \nsocioeconomic survey including poverty assessment of potential beneficiaries, and a resettlement \nplan, if necessary; and (v) agreement on the design and implementation arrangements with all \nstakeholders  through  meetings  with  relevant  ministries  and  agencies,  the  project  steering \ncommittee, and progressive workshops with all stakeholders, culminating in a national workshop. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $996,000 equivalent, comprising $506,200 in \nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $489,800  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will  finance \n$677,000 equivalent consisting of the entire foreign exchange costs and $170,800 equivalent in \nlocal currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The ", "    5 \nGovernment  will  provide  $319,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  local  currency  costs  of  office \naccommodation, data compilation, logistical support, and counterpart staff. These costs are in-kind \nand will be met from current budget allocations of MOA and local government. Detailed cost \nestimates are given in Appendix 2. Phase I accounts for about 35% of estimated costs and phase \nII, 65%. The project is expected to entail a loan of up to $50 million. The Government has been \nadvised that provision of the TA does not necessarily commit ADB to financing the ensuing \nProject. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  MOA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee will be established to \nsupervise the TA, chaired by the vice minister of agriculture, and include representatives of the \nMinistry of Economy and Budget Planning, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of \nTransport, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environmental Protection, Center \nfor Systems Research, Agency for Statistics, Agency for Land Resources Management, Agency \nfor Migration and Demography, and Committee for Water Resources and other agencies as \nrequired. Under the guidance of the steering committee, a TA working group will be established, \nchaired by the head of the Department of Analysis and State Regulation of the Development of \nAgro-Industrial Complex and Rural Territories, MOA. The working group will comprise technical \nstaff  from  the  agencies  represented  in  the  steering  committee  and  the  oblast  and  district \nrepresentatives.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over an 8\u2013month period in two phases and is expected to \ncommence in December 2003 and be completed by the end of August 2004. Phase I will be 3 \nmonths and Phase II, 5 months. Nineteen person-months of international consulting services will \nbe required, with the following expertise: regional planner and team leader, institutional specialist, \nregional economist, environmental assessment specialist, rural sociologist/resettlement specialist, \nand others as needed. Also 40 person-months of local consulting services will be required as \nfollows:  institutional  and  local  government  specialist,  rural  economist,  rural  sociologist, \nenvironment assessment specialist, civil engineer, agronomist, livestock specialist, and others as \nneeded. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be required to submit \ninception, phase I, interim, draft final (phase II), and final reports and key working papers. All \nconsultants will be recruited through a consulting firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. A simplified technical proposal procedure using the quality- and cost-based \nselection procedure will be adopted for recruiting the consulting firm. Equipment purchased under \nthe TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. An initial poverty \nand social impact assessment of the proposed project is presented in Appendix 4.  \n \n21.  The Government will provide (i) administrative assistance to the consultants for obtaining \nvisas, customs clearances, and other permits to perform their tasks in relation to the terms of \nreference; (ii) all documents and information available to agencies within the government that will \nfacilitate the work of the consultants; (iii) adequate office space for all consultants with appropriate \nfurniture; (iv) local communications facilities and direct access to international communication \nfacilities (the cost of international communications will be borne by the consultants); and (v) \ncounterpart staff to work with the consultants. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The  President,  acting under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance, not exceeding the equivalent of $677,000 on a grant basis, to \nthe Government of Kazakhstan for preparing the Regional Rural Development Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.

Based on these assessments of national agencies, and pilot oblast(s) and districts, \nprepare an outline for a 5\u2013year capacity-building program. Preliminary capacity building will be \nundertaken during the course of the TA through workshops and on-the-job training.     \n \n4.  Adaptation of Tools for Regional Planning \n \n10.  Based  on  the  institutional  assessment,  the  consultants  will  introduce  internationally \nrecognized  good  practices  in  regional  and  rural  development  planning,  as  appropriate  to \nKazakhstan. Specifically, the consultant will \n \n(i)  Develop and adapt guidelines, criteria, and other tools that can enhance the \nprocess of planning and the quality of regional plans; and \n \n(ii)  organize training and workshops with national, oblast, and district planning staff \nto share these tools and support their application. \n \n11.  The tools will include those relating to the forecast and management of migration flows: \nfor example, social impact assessment of population from labor surplus regions and incentives \nto support labor mobility, and models for development of rural settlements. \n \n5.  Phase I Report and National Workshop \n \n12.  Prepare  a  report  in  both  English  and  Russian  languages  on  the  findings  and \nrecommendations made for tasks 1 to 4 and a review of the proposed outputs and activities for \nphase II. Circulate the report to invited stakeholders to the national workshop on regional and \nrural  development  planning.  Participants  should  include  representatives  of  government \nagencies, local government, external agencies, nongovernment organizations, and academia. \nPrepare proceedings of the workshop and distribute to all participants. \n \n13.  Prepare a detailed workplan for phase II for agreement by the Government and ADB. \n \n \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nC.  Detailed Tasks for Phase II \n \n1.  Refined Regional Planning Tools Through Application In Pilot Oblast(s) and \nDistricts \n \n14.  Based on the feedback received in the training activities and in the application of the \ntools in the preparation of the oblast and district regional plans, refine the planning tools and, to \nthe extent possible, develop appropriate guidelines.   \n \n  2.  Draft Regional Plans for Pilot Oblast(s) and Districts \n \n15.  Based  on  the  national  regional  development  framework,  planning  process,  and \ninstitutional assessment agreed in phase I and the National Rural Development Programme \n(NRDP)  district  classification  and  proposed  measures,  conduct  oblast-  and  district-level \nworkshops to formulate a long-term development vision and strategy for regional development. \nAdditionally, an agreement on the detailed oblast/district planning process will be reached. \n \n16.  Undertake detailed data collection, strength-weaknesses-opportunities-threats (SWOT) \nanalysis,  and  other  planning  exercises  aimed  at  understanding  regional  opportunities  and \nneeds. These exercises will be participatory in nature, involving anticipated beneficiaries and \nother  stakeholders.  The  exercise  will  culminate  in  the  identification  of  projects  that  are \nconsistent with the regional vision and strategies. These projects will form the regional plan and \nexhibit integration or clear connections in terms of their spatial dimension, sectoral nature, \ntiming, and funding sources. Some of these projects may cross district and oblast boundaries. \n \n17.  Building on the NRDP set of indicators used in the \u201cpassportization\u201d survey (para. 7, \nmain  text),  develop  a  monitoring  framework  appropriate  for  use  by  the  various  levels  of \ngovernment. \n  \n  3.  Investment Project Design \n \n18.  In parallel with the preparation of regional plans and the projects identified, prepare a \ndetailed feasibility assessment and design for an investment project to be funded by ADB. The \nproject  can  be  a  single  investment  with  multiple  components  or  a  multisector  project  and \nimplemented over 5 years. \n \n19.  The  investment  project  should  focus  on  the  key  priorities  identified  in  the  planning \nprocess and could include rural infrastructure supporting agriculture development and access to \nsocial services; agriculture and agribusiness support services particularly for private enterprises; \nand institutional development and capacity building at national, oblast, and district levels and \ncommunity-based organizations.   \n \n20.  In preparing the project, the consultants will undertake the following:  \n \n21.  Participatory Approach. In parallel with the regional planning process, ensure the \nparticipation of all stakeholders from national to community levels in the identification, design, \nand implementation arrangements for the project. The breadth and depth of participation should \nbe  appropriate  to  ensure  that  the  beneficiaries,  and  national  and  local  agencies,  reach \nconsensus  and  commitment  on  the  design  and  implementation  arrangements  and,  where \nnecessary, responsibility for operation and maintenance and cost recovery activities.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n22.  Project Framework. A project framework will be prepared progressively through the \nphase II design period of the project. This should progressively proceed from a problem analysis \nto a complete project framework with agreed goal, purpose, outputs, and activities, including \nidentification  of  realistic  performance  indicators  and  targets,  appropriate  monitoring \nmechanisms, and identification of key risks and assumptions. The project framework should be \nused as a design tool for the project. \n \n23.  Social Assessment. Identify the beneficiaries and groups expected to be affected by \nthe project and undertake an initial social assessment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook for \nIncorporation of Social Dimensions into Projects. Give particular attention to undertaking a \nsocioeconomic survey to profile the beneficiaries including gender disaggregated demographic, \neconomic, and social data where possible, plus the incidence of poverty, vulnerable groups, \nability and willingness to pay for cost recovery activities, and any adverse impacts anticipated \nfrom the project. Include a brief assessment of the key policy, legislative, institutional, and \nbudgetary frameworks for land management. Identify the capacity for communities to effectively \nmanage and implement activities at settlement level. Identify appropriate mediation measures.  \n \n24.  As part of the social assessment, review the pilot oblast(s) and districts for any voluntary \nmigration  occurring  from  areas  that  are  environmentally  hazardous  or  with  potential  weak \ngrowth potential. Assess the location and significance of this population movement, any linkage \nto the identified project areas, and the need for a resettlement plan. This assessment and plan \npreparation, if necessary, should be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A \nGuide To Good Practice.  \n \n25.  Environmental Assessment. Prepare an initial environmental examination (IEE) and \nsummary  IEE  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  and \nEnvironmental Review Procedures of the Asian Development Bank as well as Government \nenvironment requirements. The IEE and summary IEE will identify all potential environmental \nimpacts (negative and positive) and describe mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, \nbudgetary  requirements,  and  institutional  arrangements.  If  a  more  detailed  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  is  required,  the  consultants  will  prepare  the  necessary  terms  of \nreference and prepare the EIA and summary EIA in accordance with ADB and Government \nrequirements. \n \n26.  Cost  Estimates  and  Financing  Plan.  Prepare  detailed  cost  estimates  using  the \nCOSTAB software, including appropriate categories of investment, operational costs, upfront \ncharges,  commitment  charges,  and  interest  during  construction.  Costs  will  include  foreign \nexchange (including direct and indirect costs) and local cost components, and physical and \nprice contingencies. The local cost will include duties and taxes, which should be identified \nseparately. Prepare a financing plan with contributions from the Government, ADB, private \nsector, and beneficiaries. \n \n27.  Implementation Arrangements. Examine the project implementation capacity of the \nexecuting and implementing agencies and describe the organizational arrangements for project \nimplementation,  including  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and  project  coordination. \nPrepare  project  implementation  schedules  and  procurement  packages  for  civil  works, \nequipment, and services in accordance with ADB guidelines. \n \n28.  Prepare terms of reference for international and domestic consultants to support the \nimplementation of the project. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n29.  Based on the project framework, prepare a project performance monitoring system to \nfacilitate project monitoring and evaluation compatible with and/or feasible within the capacity of \nthe executing and implementing agencies. \n \n30.  Financial  and  Economic  Analysis.  Assess  the  financial  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement systems of the project implementing agencies. Provide recommendations for the \naccounting and management of project expenditures, contract management, and flow of funds \nfrom the Government and ADB. \n \n31.  Undertake financial and economic analysis of the components and the project as a \nwhole, and assess recurrent costs and implications for participating entities in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Include sensitivity analysis, distribution \neffects of the benefits, and a poverty impact assessment. \n \n  4.  Phase II Report and National Workshop \n \n32.  Prepare  a  report  in  both  English  and  Russian  languages  on  the  findings  and \nrecommendations made for tasks 1 to 3. Circulate the report to stakeholders invited to the \nsecond national workshop on regional and rural development planning. Participants should \ninclude  representatives  of  government  agencies,  local  government,  external  agencies, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  academia.  The  workshop  should  consider  the  lessons \nlearned, the proposed toolkit for regional planning, and mechanisms for institutionalizing these \nlessons and tools. Prepare proceedings of the workshop and distribute to all participants. \n \nD.  Reporting Requirements and Tripartite Meetings \n \n33.  The TA implementation is expected to take place over an 8\u2013month period, including a \nbreak of 1 month between phase I and phase II to allow time for the Government and ADB to \nreview  phase  I  and  the  outputs  and  activities  proposed  for  phase  II.  The  consultants  will \nproduce the following reports: (i) Inception report: Required at the end of 4 weeks, it will \ninclude the agreed criteria and selection of 1\u20132 oblasts for pilot testing, findings of the initial \nreview of the national regional development framework, and a work plan for the rest of phase I. \nA tripartite review meeting will be held in week five. (ii) Phase I report: Required at the end of \nweek 11 for the first national workshop at the end of phase I, the report will be in accordance \nwith  requirements  in  para.  12.  A  tripartite  review  meeting  will  be  held  prior  to  the \ncommencement of phase II.

Five copies of \neach report in English will be distributed to ADB and two copies in English and five copies in \nRussian will be distributed to the Government. In addition, key working papers will be prepared \nand submitted to the Government and ADB. ", "  Appendix 4  13 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national  priority in  Sector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty analysis?   country poverty partnership agreement \n  (PPA)?      \n   \nYes  Yes, as per PPA signed 24 July 2003. \n \nContribution of the sector to reduce poverty in Kazakhstan: \nAlthough the share of agriculture gross domestic product (GDP) has declined sharply from \n16.3% in 1993 to 9.0% in 2001, a significant portion of the country\u2019s population still remain in the \nrural areas. The share of rural population was 42% in 1990 and this went up to 44% in 2001. \nPoverty incidence is also higher in rural than in urban areas. In 2001, the proportion of poor in \nthe rural areas is 38.0% as contrasted to the urban areas, with only 20.0% and the national \npoverty  incidence  of  28.4%.  Official  unemployment  in  that  year  was  much  higher  in  rural \n(12.6%) than in urban areas (8.0%). The highest proportion of rural poor is found in the following \noblasts: Almaty, Atyrau, Jambyl, Kyzyl Orda, Mangistau, and South Kazakhstan. Atyrau and \nMangistau, two of the country\u2019s oblasts that in 2000 registered the highest regional GDP at the \naggregate and per capita levels because of their oil and gas endowments, had more than half of \ntheir population receiving lower than the subsistence minimum levels.  In addition, they showed \nhighly unequal sharing of the income between the 10% of the richest and the 10% of the \npoorest households, with the majority of the poor residing in the rural areas. Increasingly difficult \naccess to potable drinking water has resulted in a rise in waterborne diseases in these two \nregions. Mangistau registered the highest infant and maternal mortality rates across oblasts and \nhigh incidences of tuberculosis and infectious and parasitic illnesses. The case of Atyrau and \nMangistau highlights the point that while positive growth is important, the nature and source of \ngrowth  are  equally  important  considerations  to  ensure  broad-based  growth.  At  the  other \nextreme are Almaty, Jambyl, Kyzylorda, and South Kazahkstan oblasts, which recorded the \nlowest GDP and house more than half of the country\u2019s poor population. The population of the \nfour  oblasts  depends  on  their  rural  economy.  Desertification  has  adversely  affected  the \nagriculture lands of Jambyl and South Kazahkstan. Environmental problems and restricted \nwater supply exacerbate the poverty in Kyzylorda, which showed rising infant mortality rates, \ntuberculosis incidence, and infectious and parasitic illnesses. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis    Proposed Classification: Other/Economic Growth \nWhat Type of Poverty Analysis Needed? Kazakhstan is a vast country, which manifests \nvaried topographic, sociocultural, and economic factors across oblasts. To ensure a focused \nrural development strategy, peculiarities of the socioeconomy must be examined at the pilot \noblast and district levels. Poverty is oblast-specific and multifaceted, meaning that poverty is \nboth income and nonincome induced. To identify the appropriate broad-based and pro-poor \ngrowth interventions, poverty analysis will have to be disaggregated at least at the oblast and \ndistrict level (if data permits), examining the income and other determinants of poverty, the \nrelations of environment and poverty, and gender and poverty. The poverty assessment will \nrequire  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  analysis  and  the  extensive  use  of  participatory \napproaches  in  evaluating  the  root  causes  of  and  pro-poor  growth  measures  against  rural \npoverty. \n \n \n \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \nC.  Participation Process \n  Stakeholder Analysis: A combination of stakeholder and problem analysis will be undertaken \nin both the process of regional planning and the design of the investment project to ensure \nthat priority needs and measures are identified and developed. Participatory approaches that \nmaximize the participation of the community, including the rural poor, in the preparation of \nregional plans and the design and implementation of the investment project will be developed. \n \nD.
