INTRODUCTION \n1.  During an Asian Development Bank (ADB) country programming mission in 2013, the \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam  requested  that  ADB  continue  its  support  for  improving  the \nperformance of the country\u2019s official development assistance (ODA) portfolio in general and the \nADB portfolio in particular by providing this technical assistance (TA).1 ADB consulted with the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment (MPI), which will be the TA executing agency, on the scope \nof the assistance and the financing arrangements in June and July 2014. During a fact-finding \nmission in August 2014, ADB and the government officially agreed on the objectives, scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ODA has played an important role in supporting Viet Nam\u2019s socioeconomic development. \nFrom 1993 to 2013, development partners committed to provide nearly $80 billion of ODA. Out \nof the $51 billion of which the financing agreements were signed, $37.6 billion were disbursed. \nODA had accounted for about 15% of public investments in the country. Because Viet Nam is \nmoving  toward  lower  middle-income  country  status,  the  share  of  ODA  provided  on  less \nconcessional  terms  is  increasing.3 Viet  Nam  has  also  been  facing  an  ever-tighter  budget \nsituation since 2011. However, the ODA disbursements do not catch up with the increasing \nODA approvals.4 These developments require the government to make more effective use of \nODA in carrying out its public investment plans. \n \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s portfolio financial performance fell well short of the ADB average until 2013. \nThe portfolio\u2019s loan disbursement ratio was 12.33% in 2010, compared with the ADB average \nratio of 25.15%; 16.14% in 2011, compared with the 22.84% ADB average; and 11.52% in 2012, \ncompared with 22.30% for ADB\u2019s overall portfolio and 15.9% for the World Bank portfolio in Viet \nNam.5 As the result of slow disbursements, the proportion of the delayed project loans and \ngrants in the total Viet Nam portfolio in terms of monetary value has increased in recent years. \nThe ratio was 17% in 2011, 29% in 2012 and   26% in 2013. As of November 2013, out of 78 \nactive  project  loans  and grants,  22  were  extended  with  the  average  extended time  of  22 \nmonths.6 In 2013, the ratio improved sharply and matched the ADB average of 21.00%. As of \nSeptember, it was on track to do so again in 2014. Viet Nam must still overcome challenges if it \nis to improve its contract awards performance and sustain a comparable level of disbursements \nin 2015\u20132017. The first challenge is weak staff capacity in executing agencies and project \nmanagement  units  (PMUs)  of  ADB-financed  projects.  Since  2007,  the  Six  Bank  and  the \ngovernment  implemented  Joint  Action  Plans  to  improve  the  country  systems  for  project \npreparation, procurement, financial management, social safeguards, environment safeguards, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  However,  the  country  systems  particularly  procurement, \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 September 2014. \n3 The  share  of  less  concessional  lending  commitment  of  the  Six  Banks  group  (ADB,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, German development cooperation through KfW, \nKorea Eximbank, and the World Bank) increased from 20% in 2008 to 32% in 2011. \n4  The undisbursed amount of the Six Banks portfolio (which accounts for more than 80% of ODA portfolio in Viet \nNam) increased from $7.6 billion in 2006 to $20 billion in 2012.  \n5  Following the definition of disbursement ratio of the World Bank, the 2012 disbursement ratio of the ADB portfolio in \nViet Nam is 14.1% (the amount of the newly effective loans during the year is added to the total loan balance for \ndisbursement ratio in the ADB disbursement ratio formula while it is not in the World Bank formula). \n6  Source: TA 8034: Support to Improve Portfolio Performance and Aid Effectiveness. 2014. Study on Cost of Project \nImplementation Delays. Hanoi.  \n ", "2  \ndisbursement and social safeguards are yet to be in line with best international practices. \nTherefore, the application of both the government\u2019s and development partners\u2019 procedures is \nthe fact in Six Banks\u2019 projects. As of 31 May 2014, 48 central PMUs and 383 provincial PMUs \nwere involved in the overall ongoing ADB portfolio in all of the country\u2019s 63 cities and provinces. \nThe staff members of many executing agencies and PMUs are not familiar with ADB policies \nand procedures. This leads to delays in ADB approval of project documents that do not meet \nrequirements  when  they  are  submitted  and must  be returned for the  necessary  revisions. \nApprovals by executing agencies of project documents are also delayed due to the delays in the \nappraisal  of  project  documents  since  their  appraisal  departments  often  do  not  know  ADB \npolicies  and  procedures.  This  has  created  the  need  for  a  well-structured,  well-sequenced \ncapacity building program in the executing agencies and PMUs and this need is being partly \nmet  by  the  ongoing  ADB  TA  approved  in  2011  to  improve  portfolio  performance  and  aid \neffectiveness.7 \n \n4.  A second challenge is that the use of advance actions is still subject to some confusion \nand resistance in executing agencies due to institutional reluctance to change.8 Government \ndecree 38 of April 2013 on the use and management of ODA and concessional lending from \ndevelopment partners and an MPI circular in January 2014 officially allow advance actions.9 \nHowever, neither document provided clear and specific guidance on the time lines that need to \nbe followed for advance action to have the desired impact. To transform advance actions into a \ncommon practice in the Viet Nam portfolio, it is crucial that ADB raise the awareness of the \nleaders of executing agencies of the need and the feasibility of advance actions and reach a \nconsensus  with  them  on  the  timing  of  each  advance  action.  ADB  also  needs  to  provide \nextensive technical support to PMUs to help them prepare for and implement advance actions.  \n \n5.  The third challenge relates to the government\u2019s ODA monitoring and supervision, which \nhas changed under a new ODA structure. As a result of a decentralization policy in ODA \nmanagement (footnote 9) and increase in the share of some sectors in total ODA, line ministries \nare playing a bigger role in managing ODA portfolios in their areas of responsibility. In 2013, the \ngovernment established an ODA national steering committee (NSC) that is chaired by a deputy \nprime minister and comprises vice ministers of line agencies. The NSC wants to organize \nportfolio reviews  with development partners on a regular basis. ADB\u2019s Viet Nam Resident \nMission  initiated  sector  portfolio  reviews  in  2013.  Because  these  reviews  were  based  on \nfocused discussions and chaired by vice ministers of line ministries with the authority to make \ndecisions, they have been very effective in addressing sector portfolio performance issues.  It is \nimportant to institutionalize these effective portfolio management mechanisms and help ADB\u2019s \ngovernment counterparts implement the actions agreed at the review meetings. \n \n6.  During 2012 and 2013, a lack of adequate and timely provision of counterpart funds has \ncaused serious delays in several ADB-funded projects. The government\u2019s policy is to give \npriority to allocation of state budget for counterpart funding of ODA projects. However, central \ngovernment  allocates  counterpart  funds  at  the  start  of  the  year  to  each  line  ministry  and \nprovince in lump sums, leaving them to allocate these resources to the ODA projects they have \nresponsibility for at their own discretion. In addition, this lump allocation is always less than the \namount  requested,  and  counterpart  funding  for  many  ODA  projects  falls  short  of  what  is \n                                                \n7  ADB.  2011.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Support  to  Improve  Portfolio \nPerformance and Aid Effectiveness. Manila (TA 8034-VIE). \n8  Advance actions include (i) advance contracting, (ii) early establishment of a PMU, and (iii) preparation and \nsubmission for approval of a resettlement policy framework during preparation of the government\u2019s feasibility study \nand before loan negotiations. \n9  Decree 38/2013/ND-CP and Circular 01/2014/TT-BKHDT \n ", "  3\nrequired and/or is delayed as a result. The broader issue of counterpart fund shortages can be \naddressed only by strengthening the state budget and prioritizing public investments better, but \na more transparent allocation mechanism would help development partners plan ongoing ODA \nprojects more effectively. It would also enable ADB to make timely interventions with line \nagency management to secure the required counterpart funding when necessary. \n \n7.  A  successfully  delivered  output  of  ADB\u2019s  2011  TA  project  for  improving  portfolio \nperformance and aid effectiveness in Viet Nam was the institutionalization of advance actions \nthrough government decree 38 in 2013 (footnote 9 and para. 4). The decree legally enabled \nODA projects to implement advance contracting to reduce start-up delays. Under ADB\u2019s 2011 \nTA project, staff members of the executing agencies and PMUs of ADB financed-projects were \nprovided training in project management. This was the first time that staff had been trained in a \nstructured way through an annual training calendar, or that such training had included staff \nmembers at the subnational levels. About 1,800 staff members of central and subnational \ngovernment PMUs and executing agencies were trained under the 2013 and 2014 training \ncalendars, and this helped achieve the remarkable improvements in the disbursement ratios in \nthe ADB portfolio in 2013 and the first half of 2014 (para. 3). The 2011 TA will be completed in \nNovember 2014, but more support is needed to enable advance action implementation in ADB \nprojects and to meet the substantial training needs that remain.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be effective aid management by the Government of Viet Nam. The \nimpact target is for disbursements of ODA to reach $18.0 billion during 2016\u20132020, up from \n$13.8 billion during 2006\u20132010. The outcome will be an improved performance by ADB\u2019s Viet \nNam portfolio. This will be reflected by the stabilization of the loan disbursement ratio at 20% or \nbetter by 2017 as compared with 16.14% in 2011; and a project loan contract awards ratio of \n20.0% in the same year, up from 15.6% in 2013. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will have the following outputs: (i) capacity for ADB project implementation and \nsupervision improved, (ii) ADB project implementation readiness improved, (iii) coordination \nbetween the government and its development partners in portfolio management strengthened, \nand (iv) provision of institutional reform support for effective ODA management. \n \n10.  Output 1: Capacity for ADB project implementation and supervision improved. \nCapacity-building activities under the TA will result in faster compliance with ADB procedures. \nThese activities will build on, replicate, and refine the successful training programs under ADB\u2019s \nTA for improving portfolio performance and aid effectiveness in Viet Nam (footnote 7). To \nsupport the immediate need for better performance in awarding contracts and disbursing funds, \nthe TA will employ annual demand-driven training calendars and provide mainly classroom \ntraining workshops tailored to the learning needs of different groups of participants. Training \ntopics will include but not be limited to advance actions, project planning, contract management, \ndisbursement and audit, and the introduction of portfolio performance indicators. The training \nprograms will use training modules developed under the 2011 TA, as well as new training \nmodules that will be developed to cover emerging portfolio performance improvement needs. \nPriority in the training will be given to executing agencies and PMUs involved in big ADB-\nfinanced  projects  with  large  packages.  The  target  participants  will  include  not  only  staff \n ", "4  \nmembers of PMUs but also those of executing agency departments that are responsible for \nproject document appraisal and play an important role in accelerating the approval process in \nthe line ministries. Most of the training workshops will be conducted in Vietnamese by ADB \nresident  mission  staff  to  facilitate  better  understanding  and  interaction.  Awareness-raising \nworkshops on ADB policies and procedures and the differences between ADB and government \nsystems will be conducted for relevant government oversight bodies, including Viet Nam\u2019s state \nand provincial treasuries and the inspectorates. Better understanding of ADB procedures by \nthese oversight bodies will enhance PMU confidence in complying with ADB procedures. This \noutreach beyond PMU staff to officials of line ministries and other government agencies will lead \nto institutional capacity improvements in the longer term. \n \n11.  Output 2: ADB project implementation readiness improved. The TA will provide \nextensive support to help the executing agencies and PMUs of ADB-financed projects prepare \nand implement advance actions for projects in the pipeline for ADB funding. This will include \nreaching out to executing agency management and appraisal departments to clarify the need \nand feasibility of advance actions; assisting PMUs in developing advance action implementation \nschedules to maximize the benefit of advance actions; and reviewing bidding documents and \nbid  evaluation  reports  for  advance  procurement  packages  to  improve  the  quality  of  those \ndocuments before submission to ADB.10 \n \n12.  Output 3: Coordination between the government and its development partners in \nportfolio management strengthened. Portfolio performance reviews will be more effective \nwhen government ownership of the review process and follow-up actions is ensured. TA support \nfor  portfolio  reviews  will  include  support for  the  ODA  NSC  and  provincial  governments to \nprepare issues papers for joint ADB and ODA NSC portfolio reviews, provincial portfolio reviews, \ngovernment and the Six Banks joint portfolio performance reviews (JPPRs). Mechanisms for \ntracking counterpart fund allocation and the actual provision and disbursement of these funds \nunder ADB-funded projects will be explored. \n \n13.  Output 4: Provision of institutional reform support for effective ODA management. \nADB, individually and jointly with the Six Banks group, will continue to conduct policy dialogue \nwith  the  government  on  necessary  changes  to  the  legal  framework  and  institutional \narrangements for ODA management. The TA will support thematic studies to provide inputs for \nvarious  government\u2013development  partner  forums,  including  the  Vietnam  Development \nPartnership Forum, the Aid Effectiveness Forum, and JPPRs. A study on PMUs, building on \nprevious PMU studies undertaken by other development partners, will be conducted to provide \ninputs for a planned MPI circular on PMU professionalization and a planned government-led \nPMU certification program. This will support the development of a legal framework for PMU \nprofessionalization,11 enhance the sustainability of capacity-building efforts, and supplement the \nimprovement of capacity for ADB project implementation and supervision under output 1. The \ntopic  of  another  thematic  study  will  be  identified  during  TA  implementation  to  respond  to \nemerging portfolio performance issues. \n \n                                                \n10 Support to improve project implementation readiness in safeguards criteria will be provided by proposed ADB TA \nfor capacity building for project management unit professionalization. \n11   Implementation of the regulations to be issued on PMU professionalization will be supported by the proposed \nADB TA for capacity building for project management unit professionalization. \n \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \n$146,000 in counterpart funds to finance (i) miscellaneous administration and support costs for \noffice rental, utility charges, value-added tax, banking charges, stationary, and other office \nmanagement  needs;  (ii)  additional  responsibility  allowance  for  counterpart  staff;  (iii)  office \nequipment; (iv) travel costs of counterpart staff; and (v) contingencies. The counterpart funds \nwill be administered by the executing agency. The government will also provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The MPI will be the executing agency. A PMU will be set up under the MPI\u2019s Foreign \nEconomic Relations Department to manage day-to-day activities of the TA. The PMU will be \nsupported by a group of international and local consultants. \n \n16.  The TA will provide a total of 38 person-months of consultancy on portfolio management \nand  project  implementation  and  economics,  comprising  4  person-months  of  services  from \ninternational consultants and 34 person-months from national consultants. A maximum of three \ninternational and three national individual consultants will be recruited. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with ADB procedures for recruitment of individual consultants. \nTwo administrative assistants and interpreters for a total of 60 person-months will be recruited \nto support the consultant team. ADB\u2019s resident mission staff members will be resource persons \nfor training and workshops. ADB will contract non-ADB staff resource persons for a total of 1.5 \nperson-months to deliver training on the topics for which ADB\u2019s resident mission in-house \nexpertise is not available. \n \n17.  The  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). An advance payment facility \nwill be used for training workshops and seminars organized by the MPI. Procurement using TA \nproceeds will include shopping for workshop, seminar, and printing services and will follow \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017. The ADB \nresident mission, the MPI, and the consultant team will review implementation progress, inputs, \nand outputs quarterly. The TA outputs and outcome will be evaluated during TA inception, \nmidterm, and final review missions based on portfolio performance indicators. The TA impact \nwill be assessed as part of the technical assistance completion report. \n \n19.  Analytical outputs of the TA will be shared through awareness-raising and dissemination \nworkshops. Lessons learned from the TA will be shared with other stakeholders through JPPR \nworkshops. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.
