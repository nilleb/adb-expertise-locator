INTRODUCTION \n1.  The country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nViet Nam1 aims to support the reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Reforming SOEs is \ncentral to its strategy for business development and private-sector-led employment growth. ADB \nhas been engaged with Viet Nam\u2019s SOE reform since the late 1990s. The ADB strategy in this \nregard has two defining characteristics: long-term support and responsiveness. The most recent \nADB country assistance program evaluation recommends ongoing support for SOE reform by \nstrengthening institutional capacity and developing ways to interact with public finance reforms.2  \n \n2.  The Government of Viet Nam requested ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) to \nsupport institutional strengthening and capacity development within the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF)  and  in  selected  SOEs  and  thereby  sustain  the  government's  overall  SOE  reform \nagenda.3  An understanding with government counterparts was reached on the objective, scope, \ncost, and implementation arrangements for the TA during the review missions fielded from 25 \nFebruary to 1 March 2013 and 2 to 9 May 2013. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Critical to economic growth and protracted nature of reforms. The SOE sector, \nwhich includes state-owned commercial banks, is critical to Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth. SOEs \naccount for over a third of gross domestic product and roughly half of total exports, and are a \nmajor source of employment. Despite the progress achieved through the Government of Viet \nNam\u2019s  efforts since 1992, the process of reforming the SOEs has been relatively slow, confined \nmainly to smaller enterprises, and largely focused on equitization (i.e., the process of converting \nSOEs into joint stock companies with limited liability) and mergers and/or divestures of small- \nand medium-sized SOEs. While this has resulted in a marked reduction in the number of SOEs, \nfor  the  remaining  SOEs\u2014many  of them  large  in  size,  complex  in  operation,  and  weak  in \nperformance\u2014reform has neither had any clear impacts on the reallocation of state resources \nnor created any big change in the state\u2019s role in a market economy. Large general corporations \n(or conglomerates) have mostly converted into holding companies or, in a few cases, economic \ngroups have only recently begun the transformation process. Reform and restructuring of large \nSOEs is crucial to reducing the dominance of inefficient state production, promoting private \nsector development, and supporting economic growth.  \n \n4.  Key constraints. Key constraints on SOE reform are the large size of corporations in \ngeneral, difficulties in asset valuation, financial constraints, high dependence on government \nsupport, weak corporate governance, and an inadequate framework for resolving nonperforming \ndebts and disposing of related assets. Due to the large scale and complexity of operations,   \nmanagement in many general corporations has limitations in terms of skills and capacity to \nundertake the strategic and operational restructuring needed.  Most of the general corporations \nhave ventured outside their core business lines and have relied on extensive borrowing from the \ngovernment and state-owned commercial banks to finance their operations, as they have limited \naccess to capital markets.  As a result, most of the general corporations have very highly \nleveraged outstanding debt. Under changing economic conditions, this has severely constrained \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 April 2013. \n ", "2 \n \ntheir ability to service their debts and has contributed to the high level of nonperforming loans in \nthe banking system. The problem is exacerbated as much of the debts are short term, and are \noften refinanced  and  rolled  over  with  high  costs. The  valuation  of  general  corporations  is \ncomplicated  by  the  need  to  value  their  shareholdings  in  several  subsidiaries  that may  be \nengaged in a wide spectrum of businesses. Further, valuation of landholdings and old assets \nwithout original supporting documents has also proved difficult. \n \n5.  Strategic relevance. The government clearly recognizes the necessity as well as the \ncomplexity of these reforms, and has adopted a step-by-step approach in line with Viet Nam\u2019s \nSocio-Economic  Development  Strategy,  2011\u20132015;  the  government  considers  economic \nrestructuring\u2014particularly of the finance sector, public investment, and SOEs\u2014as key to long-\nterm development. To support this effort, the Prime Minister has approved the equitization plans \nof 17 economic groups, and line ministries have approved around 50 restructuring plans of \ngeneral corporations (given that these restructuring plans are mostly developed by the SOEs \nthemselves, there may be scope for improvement). The challenge now is how to implement \nthem.  The  Prime  Minister\u2019s  decision  of  19  February  2013  (339/QDD-TTg)  envisaged  that \nrestructuring SOEs is one of three main foci of overall economic restructuring, besides banking \nsector restructuring and public spending restructuring, to transform the economy and improve its \ncompetitiveness for the period 2013\u20132020.  \n \n6.  Multitranche financing facility. In December 2009, the Multitranche Financing Facility \n(MFF)  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  State-Owned  Enterprise  Reform  and \nCorporate Governance Facilitation Program was approved.4 The MFF supports the corporate, \noperational, and financial restructuring of selected individual SOEs on a pilot basis, with a view \nto developing a general approach for SOEs other than state-owned commercial banks to guide \nthe reform and restructuring of the remaining large SOEs. The first tranche of the MFF, or \nperiodic  financing  request  (PFR)  1,  supports  the  restructuring  and  reform  of  two  selected \nSOEs\u2014Song  Da  Corporation  (SDC),  a  large  construction  conglomerate,  and  Southern \nWaterborne  Transport  Corporation  (SOWATCO),  an  inland  water  transport  and  logistics \ncompany\u2014based on their readiness to undertake proper corporate, financial, and operational \nrestructuring. The MFF is now proposed to be extended to  other qualified SOEs in coordination \nwith MOF under the project\u2019s second tranche, or PFR2. This second tranche of $320 million (i.e., \n$310 million from ordinary capital resources [OCR] and $10 million from the Asian Development \nFund) has been programmed for 2014. The pilot approach is expected to successfully transform \nthe selected SOEs and thereby strengthen the government\u2019s resolve to push ahead with further \nSOE restructuring. The proposed model will go beyond mere equitization to comprehensive \ntransformation. Demonstration projects under the MFF are expected to provide the model for \nthe SOE to reform and restructure. \n \n7.  Progress of facility implementation. There has been good progress in developing the \ncorporate and financial restructuring plans for both SDC and SOWATCO, and implementation is \nexpected to continue into 2014. SDC has established a steering committee under the chairman \nto implement the restructuring plan. At SOWATCO, a monitoring committee will report progress \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the State-Owned Enterprise Reform and Corporate \nGovernance Facilitation Program. Manila. The MFF\u2014with a total allocation of $630 million ($600 million from \nordinary capital resources \uf05bOCR\uf05d and $30 million from the Asian Development Fund)\u2014has been structured into a \nthree-tranche program. The first tranche (PFR1) for $130 million ($120 million OCR and $10 million  Asian \nDevelopment Fund) became effective in 2011 and is being implemented. The OCR loan is meant to support the \nfinancial restructuring of the selected SOEs, while the Asian Development Fund  loan is to help them implement \nthe corporate and organizational restructuring, including strengthening corporate governance standards. ", "  3 \nto the shareholders. Progress at SDC has been challenging.5 Following the dissolution of the \neconomic group, the board members are united in their resolve to implement its restructuring \nplan. However, given the size of the company, heavy debt burden, and the complexity of its \noperations\u2014with multiple lines of business that have made large investments in the last several \nyears with limited prospects of returns in the current economic environment\u2014drastic measures \nwill need to be taken for its turnaround.  SOWATCO has made good progress given its smaller \nsize, and its restructuring plan is being implemented with a focus on two core business lines \n(transport and logistics) and on having a holding company structure that will provide strategy \nand support services.  At a macro level, progress to date on implementing PFR1 has led to new \npolicy decisions by the government on how general corporations should be restructured within a \nprescribed  timeline  for  divestment  of  noncore  business  lines.  Under  an  ADB  capacity \ndevelopment TA,6 the progress on implementing PFR1 is being tracked, and a monitoring \nframework for the overall MFF is being devised. MOF has plans to make the appointment of \nindependent directors to the SOE board mandatory as well as have an independent audit \ncommittee reporting to the board. \n \n8.  SOE reform is an inherently complex process, requiring holistic financial and corporate \nrestructuring. First, this is a novel approach for Viet Nam, formulated with the help of the ADB \nMFF project. Such expertise is not available within SOEs and MOF, and  it takes external \nsupport to carry out the due diligence process and in the process strengthening if required, of \nalready developed restructuring plans. Second, MOF has developed (in consultation with ADB) \na set of criteria for shortlisting selected SOEs for restructuring support under the MFF's PFR2 \nand PFR3, which will enable MOF to assess and rank candidates with the highest potential to \nmeet the reform objective.7 Selection criteria were discussed by MOF in a workshop with all \nrelevant  stakeholders  and  disseminated  through  the  MOF  website.  Selected  SOEs  will  be \nconsidered for participation in the second phase of the project and will undergo rigorous due \ndiligence by the MOF team, given that the loan is guaranteed by the government. ADB is \ncommitted to supporting capacity development of MOF, and in turn of the SOEs, in this process. \nThird,  PFR1  implementation  has  underscored  the  need  for  sustained  technical  support  to \nparticipating SOEs, and also the lack of required technical capacity at MOF. MOF has been \nassigned by the government to take the lead in the development and implementation of an SOE \nrestructuring program, which takes into account and builds on lessons and experience gained \nfrom the implementation of the pilot restructurings under the MFF. In view of this, the proposed \nTA will help MOF in strengthening the institutional process and the policy framework to sustain \nSOE reforms, and help it in preparing candidate SOEs to implement their individual restructuring \nplans, as each is different and unique from the other with regard to its mandate and business \nlines. Such support is not envisaged for PFR3, as MOF's capacity is expected to have been \nstrengthened adequately by then. Hence, MOF needs sustained TA support to enable it to \nimplement the MFF and to upscale the reform process to all SOEs in the future. In addition to \nthe above support, MOF has also requested support for development of knowledge products as \nwell as a framework for overseeing the progress of SOE reforms in Viet Nam.  \n \n                                                \n5 Three years were lost in the case of SDC due to a government decision in January 2010 to convert SDC into an \neconomic group by merging five large additional SOEs with SDC. Realizing that this was unwieldy, the government \nreversed the merger in October 2012, thus restoring SDC's original structure. A revised restructuring plan is now \ndeveloped and under implementation.   \n6  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Strengthening Support for State-Owned \nEnterprise Reform and Corporate Governance Facilitation Program. Manila.        \n7 To aid this process, MOF and ADB, supported by external expert advice under the ongoing capacity development \nTA, devised two sets of criteria\u2014six essential criteria and 20 variables. The list is available on request. \n ", "4 \n \n9.  The implementation of the TA will be informed by lessons and experience of SOE \nreforms undertaken since 1992 and, in particular, the experience from the pilot phase of the \nMFF. Institutional capacity building, extended support during implementation, awareness and \nknowledge of the sociopolitical environment, sensitivities, and ownership of the project are some \nof the key lessons for implementing SOE reforms in the capacity-constrained environment of \nViet Nam.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The expected impact of the TA overall will be greater profitability of restructured SOEs \nand better management of state-managed investments. The expected outcome will be stronger \ncapacity of MOF to facilitate selected SOEs\u2019 transformation into financially viable and efficiently \nmanaged enterprises.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.   The TA will support MOF in (i) conducting due diligence of selected SOEs,  (ii) finalizing \nthe restructuring and implementation plans of selected SOEs, and (iii) developing knowledge \nproducts to guide SOE reform in Viet Nam. Restructuring plans developed by candidate SOEs \nwill be further improved and refined with the support of external experts under the proposed TA \nto ready these additional SOE candidates for participation under PFR2. This is in line with the \napproach adopted and recommended under the ADB MFF project, which aims to strengthen the \nperformance of SOEs through holistic restructuring, both corporate and financial. Restructuring \nwill  focus  on  core  business  lines;  divestment  of  noncore  business;  financial  restructuring \nthrough debt restructuring and cost reduction; and organizational restructuring including change \nmanagement, risk management measures, and improvement of information technology and \nstaff skills. The restructuring plans so developed for additional SOEs will be screened and \nrefined with the support of the TA. In addition, the TA will support institutional strengthening and \ncapacity development of MOF in initiating, adopting, and implementing measures in core areas \nof SOE reforms, as it is the leading agency for SOE reform in Viet Nam.  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of remuneration of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and \nother in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  MOF is the executing agency for the MFF overall, and the selected SOEs are the \nimplementing agencies for each tranche. For this TA, MOF will be the executing agency and the \nselected  SOEs  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  A  project  management  unit  has  been \nestablished within MOF to coordinate activities and monitor the progress of implementation, and \nsubmit progress reports to ADB. Each selected SOE will establish a unit to oversee project \nimplementation  and  provide  progress  reports  to  the  MOF  project  management  unit. \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA implementation period \nwill be from 1 August 2013 to 31 December 2014. ", "  5 \n \n14.  The TA will provide 61 person-months of consultancy services\u201418.5 person-months of \ninternational (5) and 42.5 person-months of national consultants (7)\u2014through a consulting firm. \nThe international input comprises an SOE reform and corporate governance specialist (and \nteam leader), corporate restructuring specialist, financial restructuring specialist, SOE legal and \nregulatory expert, social safeguard specialist; the national experts are an SOE reform and \ncorporate restructuring specialist, financial specialist, SOE legal and regulatory expert, poverty \nand social development specialist, gender specialist, social safeguard specialist, and translator \nand editor. The consulting firm will be selected by quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS \n80:20)  method  using  the  simplified  technical  proposal.  The  consultants  will  work  on  an \nintermittent  basis  and  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for the TA \nconsultants is in Appendix 3.  \n \n15.  Several workshops will be held intermittently to strengthen the capacity of MOF and the \nline ministries and to discuss, comment, and obtain stakeholder feedback on the evolving \nframework for SOE reform. Workshops will engage national and international resource persons \nas needed. While consultants will support and conduct workshops, seminars, and conferences \n(including logistical arrangements), an advance payment facility will be used as needed by the \nexecuting agency, which will manage and administer the activity costs, including the liquidation \nof advances.  \n \n16.  The consultant team will assist MOF and selected SOEs in undertaking a corporate audit \nof the safeguard policy aspects, and solve labor-related issues and gender concerns arising \nfrom  the  restructuring  of  selected  SOEs  under  PFR2,  within  the  remit  of  the  relevant \ngovernment regulations. The restructuring of general corporations and institutional capacity \nbuilding envisaged under the MFF are gender neutral; however, due diligence of selected SOEs \nwill ascertain human development and human resource aspects and training needs, including \nentry points for incorporating gender design features. There will be special focus on measures \nto promote women\u2019s representation in higher levels of SOE management, training targets for \nwomen,  and  promotion  of gender  sensitivity  in  the  SOE  workplace.  The gender  specialist \nengaged under the TA will prepare a gender action plan for the selected SOEs. \n \n17.  TA implementation will be closely monitored and evaluated through ongoing consultation \nwith stakeholders, regular review missions, and periodic progress reports. The TA will support \ntimely distillation and dissemination of recommendations and lessons through print and web-\nbased publication of working papers and support for stakeholder workshops and conferences. \n \nIV.
