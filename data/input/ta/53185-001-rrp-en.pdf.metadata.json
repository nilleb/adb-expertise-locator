I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $30,000,000 in CDH VGC Fund II, L.P. (VGC Fund II or the fund), a private \nequity fund investing in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  Rationale for proposed ADB assistance. The proposed investment in VGC Fund II will \nprovide about 20 private companies with growth capital to help fast track their development. In \ndoing so, the fund will help increase the depth and diversity of venture and growth capital business \nmodels, encourage entrepreneurship, and support the transition of the PRC economy from one \nfocused on manufacturing to one driven increasingly by innovation and technology. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Description.  Founded  in  2002  by  six  founding  partners,  CDH  China  Management \nCompany Limited and its affiliate (collectively known as \u201cCDH\u201d) is a pioneer private equity fund \nmanager that invests in companies with significant operations in the PRC.1 CDH has developed \nin-depth knowledge and expertise within target sectors from its long record of managing different \nfunds before VGC Fund II, which intends to invest in early to growth stage companies. 2 The fund \nmay also invest a limited portion of its capital opportunistically outside of its primary investment \nobjectives.3 VGC Fund II intends to focus on companies in the health care, logistics and/or \nconsumer goods, and artificial intelligence and technology sectors.4 VGC Fund II\u2019s investment \nteam is led by Wang Lin and comprises 25 investment professionals, including 10 partners across \nits four offices.5 \n \n4.  Since  its  inception,  CDH  has  raised  14  private  equity  and  venture  capital  funds \ndenominated in United States (US) dollars and renminbi, exceeding $10 billion in commitments.6 \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access \nto Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n5.  VGC Fund II is a closed-end private equity fund with a target capitalization of $500 million. \nCDH VGC II Holdings Company Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company, will manage the \nfund as the general partner. CDH Mid Market Management Company Limited, a Cayman Islands \n \n1  The founding partners are Wu Shangzhi, Jiao Shuge, Stuart Schonberger, Hu Xiaoling, Wang Lin, and Wang Zhenyu; \nCDH VGC II Holdings Company Limited (general partner), CDH Mid Market Management Company Limited \n(manager), CDH Investments Management (Hong Kong) Limited (investment advisor), and any other entities that \nacted and/or will act as advisors to CDH VGC Fund II, L.P. and CDH\u2019s other funds are collectively referred to as \nCDH. \n2  CDH is an investment platform that, in addition to private equity funds (both onshore and offshore), manages different \nasset classes, including private equity, real estate, mezzanine, public fixed income, public equity, and private wealth \nmanagement. \n3 The ability to make opportunistic investments will provide the fund greater flexibility to create a balanced portfolio, \ngiven its focus on early to growth stage portfolio companies, and will include the ability to invest in publicly listed \nsecurities. \n4  The fund may also invest in other sectors. A climate change target amount cannot be specified as this is an \ninvestment in a fund (as opposed to an investment in a company), and the composition of the underlying investee \ncompanies is not yet known. \n5  As of 31 July 2019, CDH employed more than 300 staff, including more than 150 investment professionals across \nBeijing, Hong Kong, China, Shanghai, and Singapore that manage different asset platforms. \n6  As of 31 March 2019; excludes CDH real estate, mezzanine finance, public equities, fixed income, and wealth \nmanagement businesses. \n ", "2 \nexempted company, will provide management and administrative services to the fund as its \nmanager. It will also enter into arrangements with CDH Investments Management (Hong Kong) \nLimited, the advisor and a Hong Kong, China limited liability company, to obtain advisory \nservices.7 \n \n6.  Investment identification. Through market mapping of 40 private equity funds focused \non the PRC, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) identified CDH as one of the top performing and \nconsistent fund managers investing growth capital in small and medium-sized companies. CDH \nhas a strong investment track record and has demonstrated its ability to anticipate and capitalize \non fast-growing sectors in the PRC. \n \n7.  ADB initiated dialogue with CDH in 2015 and has actively tracked the platform since then. \nADB views the proposed investment to be consistent with its private equity fund investment \nguidelines. The investment would provide development benefits, including skilled jobs generation \nand technological innovation and adoption, particularly in the PRC health care sector. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  VGC Fund II aims to make about 20 investments averaging $10 million\u2013$30 million each \nin early to growth stage companies. The fund may provide additional capital to certain companies \nthat have grown significantly since the initial investments. It will generally seek to invest in \nbusinesses with experienced and driven management teams; strong alignment of interests with \nbusiness owners and management; significant growth prospects; mutually agreed exit strategies; \nand opportunities for the general partner to add value through its operational, strategic, and/or \ncapital markets expertise. VGC Fund II may invest a limited portion of its committed capital for \nopportunistic investments outside of its primary investment objective (footnote 3). \n \n9.  VGC Fund II will adopt a top-down, research-intensive approach to identify key players in \ntargeted sectors and source investment opportunities with leading entrepreneurs. The fund\u2019s \ninvestments are expected to improve the PRC\u2019s supply and demand imbalances, increase \nefficiency  and/or  reduce  costs  through  technology  advancements  and/or  business  model \nupgrades to deliver long-term sustainable growth. CDH also aims to build an ecosystem of \nstakeholders with complementary businesses in each sector that will benefit and add value to \nexisting and potential portfolio companies. \n \n10.  CDH\u2019s  extensive  investment  experience  in  each  identified  sector  has  allowed  it  to \nproactively  address  the  challenges  and  opportunities  arising  from  the  PRC\u2019s  fast-evolving \neconomy. The investment team will rely on CDH\u2019s extensive relationships to identify attractive \ninvestment opportunities and build a complementary network including leading entrepreneurs and \nmanagement teams in PRC. The investment team may use industry experts to analyze specific \nissues to mitigate particular risks and seek operational improvements. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n11.  Ownership. VGC Fund II is an exempted limited partnership registered in the Cayman \nIslands. Its limited partners include institutional investors and family offices. ADB will be the first \ndevelopment financial institution to invest in VGC Fund II and will therefore add value in terms of \ncorporate  governance,  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  and  heightened  focus  on \n \n7  Detailed information on the structure of the fund is in Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \ndevelopment investments. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to \ndisclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n12.  Management. The investment team consists of 25 investment professionals led by two \nmanaging partners\u2014Wang Lin and Huang Yan\u2014who are supported by eight senior partners, \neach with an average of 10 years of private equity and/or operational experience in the PRC. The \ntwo managing partners, along with chairman Wu Shangzhi and chief executive officer Jiao Shuge, \nwill form the investment committee, which approves investments by majority decision. CDH also \nhas  59  back-office  staff,  including  legal  and  compliance,  finance  and  accounting,  investor \nrelations, and human resources, to support the investment platform. \n \n13.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence and enhanced tax integrity due diligence on CDH \nand  its  related  entities  and  identified  no  significant  integrity  risks.8  The  results  are  in  the \nownership, management, and governance linked document (footnote 7). ADB\u2019s review of the \nentity does not give the bank cause to believe that CDH was established or is being used for \nmoney laundering or terrorism financing. ADB has obtained reasonable assurance that the \ntransaction is not being used for tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud; and that the tax integrity \nrisks are low and acceptable to the bank. \n \n14.  Governance structure. VGC Fund II follows a three-stage investment and divestment \nprocess: sourcing and underwriting, portfolio monitoring, and exiting. \n \n15.  A typical investment would be led by one partner and up to four investment professionals, \ndepending on the deal size. The investment team evaluates a deal, prepares its investment thesis, \nand conducts due diligence on the target company. The sourcing and underwriting of investments \nare further divided into a four-stage process: \n(i)  Project brief. The investment team drafts a project brief on the opportunity. \n(ii)  Initiating memorandum. The investment team conducts initial due diligence on the \ntarget company\u2019s business model and growth prospects, industry analysis, valuation, \nand key risks; and presents its findings to the investment committee. \n(iii)  Investment decision memorandum. The investment team completes the necessary \nfinancial, legal, and technical due diligence; and prepares a formal memorandum for \nthe investment committee\u2019s approval. \n(iv)  Final investment decision and execution. The investment team closes the deal and \nenters into binding legal documentation. \n \n16.  The investment team also manages the portfolio investment through the planned exits. \nMonitoring may include (i) active participation at the board level, (ii) regular dialogue  with \nmanagement  and  company  visits,  (iii)  budget  and  strategy  reviews,  and  (iv)  management \ninformation analysis. The team also works closely with company management to execute the \ngrowth strategy. Key focus areas for value creation include (i) active involvement in strategic \ndecisions to enhance market position, (ii) navigation of complex shareholding structures, (iii) \nexternal growth through mergers and acquisitions, and (iv) long-term financing solutions via \ncapital markets access. The investment team also monitors market conditions that could impact \nthe exit strategy and timing. \n \n \n8  ADB. 2003.

In addition to the investment committee, an advisory committee comprising of up to eight \nlimited partners will be formed to advise the general partner, with the primary role of reviewing \ntransactions involving conflicts of interest.9 [This information has been removed as it falls under \nthe exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n18.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].10 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n19.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $30,000,000 in VGC Fund II. The ADB \ninvestment will not exceed 25% of the fund\u2019s total committed capital and will not result in ADB \nbeing its single largest investor. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n \n20.  The general partner aims to achieve a target gross internal rate of return of 25% in US \ndollars for the fund. Consistent with market practice but subject to certain limitations, the general \npartner can recall a portion of ADB\u2019s capital (previously distributed to ADB) for reinvestment. In \nsuch instances, ADB\u2019s total capital commitment to VGC Fund II will remain unchanged. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  Exit strategy. CDH will have a 10-year term from final closing, subject to two 1-year \nextensions. The anticipated exit strategies of CDH\u2019s investments include (i) public offerings on \nthe Hong Kong, China; PRC; and/or other international stock exchanges; (ii) trade sales of \nportfolio companies to local and foreign strategic buyers; and (iii) secondary sales to other private \nequity funds. \n \n22.  Reporting arrangements. The general partner will provide ADB with unaudited quarterly \nreports, audited annual reports with financial statements, quarterly and annual fund overview \nreports  with  summary  description  of  each  portfolio  company,  and  annual  development \neffectiveness monitoring reports. ADB will review this information and follow up with the general \npartner if more information or clarification is needed. If the information received from the general \npartner raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in VGC Fund II, ADB could \ndecide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent and detailed review. \n \n23.  VGC  Fund  II  will  adopt  an  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS) \ncompliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) before its first disbursement and must \nreport annually on environmental and social safeguard issues. ADB will monitor the timing and \nquality of the ESMS reports and offer guidance if the general partner requires clarification on \nADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \n \n9  Voting representatives of the advisory committee will not be affiliates of the general partner or the advisor. \n10 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n ", "5 \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n24.  Promote private sector development. The proposed investment is in line with ADB\u2019s \nobjectives to promote private sector development by supporting the PRC\u2019s rapidly growing private \nsector  economy.  Through  this  investment,  ADB  will  help  finance  small  and  medium-sized \ncompanies in the PRC, thereby potentially reducing the economic dominance of large state-\nowned enterprises. VGC Fund II is expected to identify and support strong, capable business \nleaders, thereby helping to foster a new generation of entrepreneurs in the PRC. By supporting \nthe  fund,  ADB  also  aims  to  increase  business  efficiency,  labor  productivity,  and  overall \nemployment in the investee companies. \n \n25.  Raise standards. As the second development financial institution investor in a CDH-\nmanaged fund, ADB will enhance VGC Fund II\u2019s ESMS to comply with the bank\u2019s environmental \nand social safeguard standards and report on development indicators. In addition, ADB and other \nadvisory committee members will provide oversight on important governance matters, which are \ncritical for companies to demonstrate as they seek additional sources of growth capital. \n \n26.  Mobilize cofinancing opportunities. CDH values ADB\u2019s ability to provide debt and \nequity financing directly to portfolio companies to help them grow. In addition to providing capital \nfrom its own balance sheet, ADB can help mobilize financing from third-party sources. \n \nE.  Risks \n \n27.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n33.  Impact. The depth and diversity in venture and growth capital business models and \nentrepreneurship in the PRC is enhanced, and the transition from a manufacturing-focused to an \ninnovation and technology-oriented PRC economy is supported. \n \n34.  Outcome.  Financial  sustainability  and  operational  value  addition  of  private  equity \ninvestments to the fund\u2019s portfolio companies is demonstrated. \n \n35.  Outputs. With respect to VGC Fund II, (i) an advisory committee is established, and (ii) \ncapital is invested. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n36.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The investment is aligned with \nthe operational priorities of ADB Strategy 2030, including addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities by generating quality jobs, improving education, and achieving better health \nfor all.14 Strategy 2030 also supports using private equity funds as an important modality to extend \nADB\u2019s reach because of their significant leveraging and mobilizing effects, as well as to promote \nfinancial inclusion. \n \n37.  Consistency with country strategy. The investment is aligned with ADB\u2019s PRC country \npartnership strategy, 2016\u20132020, which prioritizes enhancing finance sector infrastructure and \nsupporting commercially viable business models to assist in continued domestic rebalancing from \nindustry to services.15 \n \n38.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. ADB\u2019s Operational \nPlan for Health strongly supports private sector approaches to address quality, affordability, and \naccessibility in the health sector.16 By investing in VGC Fund II, ADB would be partnering with a \nleading PRC-focused private equity fund manager that has developed deep expertise and a \nnetwork in health care. Investments made by the fund are expected to support the generation of \ninnovative solutions to improve the quality, accessibility, and affordability of health care services \nin the PRC. \n \n39.  Lessons from previous operations. The project team considered lessons from previous \nADB private equity fund investments and incorporated the same into the proposed transaction. \nFor example, an evaluation report published in 2019 on ADB Private Sector Equity Investments \nconcluded that ADB should refine its approach to private equity fund investments to ensure their \nfinancial sustainability and appropriately prioritize value addition and development impact.17 In \nthis case, ADB comprehensively assessed CDH as a platform, including the quality and depth of \nthe management team, performance of its portfolio companies, and investment and exit record of \nprior funds. ADB also confirmed CDH\u2019s alignment with the bank\u2019s development mandate in terms \n \n14 ADB. 2018.

The project team proceeded with the investment after confirming through due \ndiligence that CDH meets financial sustainability, value addition, and development impact criteria. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n40.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.18 \n \n41.  Category FI. ADB has assessed the investment's potential environmental and social \nimpacts, its risks associated with VGC Fund II\u2019s existing and/or likely future portfolio, and its \ncommitment  and  capacity  for  environmental  and  social  management.  The  potential  fund \ninvestees\u2019 business activities are not expected to generate significant environmental and social \nimpacts or risks, require involuntary resettlement, or adversely or beneficially affect distinct and \nvulnerable ethnic minority communities. Environmental impacts caused by expected investee \nbusiness activities are, however, possible during the construction and operation of buildings, such \nas health care and manufacturing facilities. Such environmental impacts are expected to be site-\nspecific, few are irreversible, and in most cases mitigation measures can be incorporated in the \nproject designs and operational controls. All other prospective investments are expected to be \nsmall-scale and operate in leased premises in urban and peri-urban locations. ADB will have the \nright to be exempted from contributing capital to any proposed investment that it assesses as \nbeing noncompliant with the ESMS and any safeguards category A investment. \n \n42.  VGC Fund II has established and implemented an ESMS commensurate with identified \nportfolio risks and impacts. The ESMS was established following the Performance Standards on \nEnvironmental and Social Standards of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) after IFC\u2019s \ninvestment in CDH Fund V in 2013 and was last updated in January 2018.19 During due diligence, \nADB has identified the following actions to enhance the ESMS: harmonize the fund\u2019s exclusion \nlist with ADB's prohibited investment activities list; update procedures for categorizing projects \nbased on Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, and for compliance with national laws and \nregulations; include measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards \npursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001); include a grievance redress mechanism; \ninclude project information disclosure and meaningful consultation with affected people following \nADB  requirements;  and  provide  supervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting  of  fund  investees\u2019 \nenvironmental and social performance to ADB.20 The ESMS will be enhanced following Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements and approved by ADB before ADB\u2019s first disbursement. CDH will \ninclude in its regular reporting information to ADB for VGC Fund II (i) the nature of subprojects \nand  categorization,  (ii)  compliance  with  the  safeguard  and  social  requirements,  and  (iii) \ncompliance with applicable national and international laws and standards.  \n \n43.  No gender elements. The project team discussed opportunities with CDH to undertake \nan internal gender diversity and inclusion policy review and include gender indicators in their \ninvestment appraisal process. However, CDH does not view such measures to be necessary for \na PRC-based and -focused private equity firm given the country\u2019s strong policy and legislative \n \n18  ADB.

CDH will report annually to ADB using sex-disaggregated data on (i) its \ncompliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n44.  CDH was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
