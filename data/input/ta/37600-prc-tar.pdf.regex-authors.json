The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) for a second Urban Poverty \nStrategy  Study  focusing  on  access  to  social services  for  poor  urban  migrants.  The  TA  is \nincluded in the PRC country strategy and program update for 2005\u20132007,1 and is programmed \nfor 2005.2 Fact-finding for the TA was undertaken in July 2005 and an understanding was \nreached  with  the  Government  on  the  impact  and  outcome,  scope,  costs  and  financing, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n2.  The TA for the first Urban Poverty Study (TA 3377)3 was completed in 2001. The major \noutputs of the TA included: (i) a comprehensive survey of (a) urban poverty, its magnitude, \ngeographical  distribution  and  causes,  and  (b)  urban  poverty  reduction  policy  in  the  PRC; \n(ii) estimation of urban poverty lines for all provinces and 35 major cities in the PRC using best \npractice  statistical  techniques,  based  on  the  1998  national  urban  household  survey  data; \n(iii) adoption of a two-track approach to poverty analysis (i.e., quantitative analysis of urban \npoverty supplemented by information from structured interviews with sample poor households in \nfour cities), which reflects the multiple facets of urban poverty; (iv) meticulous assessment of the \nthree  policy  measures  to  prevent  and  alleviate  urban  poverty:  Assistance  to  Laid-Off \nEmployees, Unemployment Insurance, and the Minimum Living Standard Scheme (MLSS);4  \nand (v) a detailed list of feasible policy recommendations focusing on the main problems in \nmonitoring and reducing urban poverty. The proposed TA will build on the outputs of the first \nUrban Poverty Study and focus on the issue of migrant workers and related poverty reduction \nmeasures.  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Prior to the 1990s, poverty in the PRC was primarily a rural problem. Urban poverty was \nconfined to a small proportion of urban residents who suffered from inability to work, lack of \nsavings or other source of income, and/or absence of relatives to depend on. In the mid-1990s, \nurban poverty was driven by layoffs from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) combined with the \ndismantling of the welfare systems formerly provided by SOEs. The rapid influx of \u201cfloating \nmigrants\u201d\u2014usually unskilled\u2014from rural areas added a new population element to the urban \npoor. Urban poverty has three categories: (i) hard core urban poor (comprising the disabled and \nelderly without family support), (ii) laid-off workers, and (iii) migrant workers.  \n \n4.  The urban migrant factor has become increasingly prominent, and poverty among rural \nto urban migrants has emerged as the leading issue in any effort to combat urban poverty. The \npoverty rate among migrants is more severe5 than among permanent urban residents, while the \nnumber of urban migrant poor now exceeds SOE-related poor. This trend will continue, since \nthe problems caused by the decommissioning of SOEs are time-bound and will pass when most \nof the affected persons retire within a decade or so. A further contribution to migrant urban poor \nis their exclusion from the rapidly expanded MLSS due to their nonurban registration status, \nwhich, however, has been successful in providing income support to low-income registered \nurban dwellers.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132007): People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila.   \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 21 July 2005.   \n3  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Urban Poverty Study. Manila.   \n4  National urban household survey conducted by the National Statistics Bureau of the PRC in 1998. \n5 The first Urban Poverty Strategy Study showed that the poverty level of urban migrants is 50% higher than for  \n   permanent urban residents. \n ", "2   \n5.  Given their low incomes and lack of MLSS access, urban migrant populations lack \nadequate  access  to  key  public  social  services  such  as  education,  health,  housing,  and \nemployment services. Despite some recent policy statements encouraging expanded access to \nsuch services, many bottlenecks\u2014administrative, financial, and policy-related\u2014prevent poor \nurban  migrant  populations  from  accessing  such  benefits,  thus  exacerbating  their  poverty \ncondition and vulnerability. \n \n6.  The  PRC  is  using  urbanization  as  a  key  strategy  to  alleviate  rural  poverty  by \nencouraging the transfer of large numbers of the unemployed or underemployed from the \ncountryside to towns and cities. However, without adequate attention to the problems of the \nurban  poor  migrant,  this  approach  could  simply  transfer  the  location  of  poverty  from  the \ncountryside  to  urban  areas.  Therefore,  cities  must  establish  an  urban  antipoverty  system \nfocusing on ensuring access to basic social services for migrant poor. The proposed TA will \nfacilitate this by: (i) collecting case study data and encouraging cross-ministerial collaboration to \nformulate  government  level  responses;  and  (ii)  producing  a  series  of  actionable \nrecommendations to be submitted to the State Council by the Development Research Center \n(DRC)\u2014the Executing Agency\u2014on addressing the problem of access to basic public services \nby urban poor migrants.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced access to urban social services by urban poor \nmigrants and reduced urban poverty. This will contribute to the creation of a national system of \nurban  poverty  alleviation  and  an  integrated  approach  to  resolving  some  of  the  systemic \ndifficulties introduced by large-scale, rural-urban migrant flow. The outcome of the TA is to \nproduce a comprehensive set of policy and administrative reform recommendations that will be \nsubmitted by the DRC to the State Council to enable the Government to further contribute to \nalleviating urban poverty. This policy recommendations report (PRR) will reflect consensus \namong key ministries on actions to enhance access to public goods (education, health care, \nhousing,  and  employment  services)  by  poor  urban  migrants.6  If  the  recommendations  are \nenacted, access to public goods could be enhanced significantly and it would contribute to \npoverty reduction in urban areas of PRC. Other related outcomes would be an update on the \nurban poverty situation and an innovative and practical methodology to identify poverty cities in \nthe PRC.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  have  two  major  outputs:  a  field  studies  report  (FSR)  and  a  PRR \n(Appendix 4). The FSR will investigate obstacles to accessing education, health care, housing, \nand employment services by poor urban migrants in a midsize city and another relevant city in \nthe mid or north west,7 through a mix of qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Since the \n                                                 \n6  Poor migrants are migrant households living below or slightly above the MLSS, as migrant households who live \nabout 10\u201315% above the MLSS are at risk of falling below it. \n7\n Two possible case study cities were discussed, one in a midsize city in Guangdong and the other in the provincial \ncapital of a northwest province such as Urumqi. These case study cities would provide a snapshot of urban poverty \nunder two contrasting contexts: (i) a relatively prosperous municipality with high (Han) in-migrant numbers, and (ii) \na less developed multicultural municipality. DRC will make the final selection on the case study cities before \nFebruary 2006. \n ", "  3\nTA will prepare policy recommendations using findings from the field studies, the case study \ncities should represent typical municipalities in developed and less developed regions in the \nPRC. In-depth consultations with municipal government agencies and poor migrants and a \nseries of field observations of public goods delivery will be critical to this process. The FSR will \ninclude a series of recommendations on enhancing access to these public goods. \n \n9.  A cross-ministerial project steering committee will be set up at project launch to guide \nthe preparation of the FSR and oversee the production of the PRR to be submitted to the State \nCouncil. This will be discussed in detail at the inception stage of the TA. \n \n10.  A series of workshops led by the DRC and attended by the cross-ministerial steering \ncommittee and other relevant government agencies will review the FSR recommendations, \ndecide on appropriate ministerial responses, review ministerial action plans, and review and \napprove a final PRR. This cross-agency dialogue will be critical to mitigate the potential risks of \nweak information sharing, and interagency disagreement on direction and respective roles.  \n \n 11.  The PRR will document and disseminate to key policymakers on the State Council the \ninteragency steering group\u2019s recommendations to enhance urban poor migrant access to key \npublic goods. Its main annex will be a comprehensive framework for strategy and reform, \nincluding concrete action plans for enacting the report\u2019s recommendations.  \n \n12.  Each ministry will produce its own action plan for enhancing urban migrant poor access, \nwhich will constitute part of the PRR. The action plans will propose specific actions that will \nenable increased access primarily\u2014but not exclusively\u2014to the public good that falls under the \nministry\u2019s  authority.  Each  action  plan  will  be  accompanied  by  a  timetable  for  proposed \nimplementation and analysis of budget implications for carrying out each recommendation.  \n \n13.  The  successful  production  of  a  PRR  can  only  be  the  result  of  an  ongoing  cross-\nministerial commitment to an integrated approach for confronting obstacles to public goods \naccess by the urban migrant poor. As such, DRC\u2019s coordination and support for the ongoing \nprocess of developing ministerial action plans and integrating them into the PRR will be critical. \n   \n C.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $410,000 equivalent, of which $114,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $296,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will provide \n$300,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost, and $186,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost, financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, \nadministered by ADB. The TA will finance consulting services; office equipment and supplies; \nworkshops and training, and field studies. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $110,000, through the provision of office accommodation and \nvenues for meetings, counterpart staff and allowances, miscellaneous administration expenses \nand certain local transport. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from March 2006 to September 20078 by a \nteam of international (4 person-months) and domestic (19 person-months) consultants. The \n                                                 \n8  The DRC indicated that the appropriate time for commencement of TA activities is after completion of the National \nPeople\u2019s Congress in March 2006. ", "4   \ninternational consultant will have expertise in urban poverty and related rural-migration issues \nand urban development. The domestic consultants will include two specialists with practical \nexperience  in  social  assessment  methodology,  urban  poverty,  and  policy  and  institutional \nanalysis; and two specialists with experience in social and poverty analysis and rural-urban \nmigration  issues  in  the  PRC.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultants will review \ninternational literature and practices on urban migration and conduct field studies, prepare the \nFSR, prepare and organize project workshops, liaise with government agencies as necessary, \nprepare the PRR, and collaborate closely with the DRC. The terms of reference (Appendix 3) \noutline their tasks and reporting requirements. Equipment will be procured by the consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The DRC will finalize the selection of the \ncase study cities before February 2006. Consultants\u2019 reports will be prepared in Chinese and \nEnglish.  \n \n17.  DRC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. DRC is a policy research institute under \nthe State Council of the PRC with the status of a central ministry. Since its foundation in 1981 \nas the Economic Research Center of the State Council, DRC has played a leading role in \nproviding advice to policy makers at central and provincial levels on topical issues in economics, \nsocial, and technology policies. DRC has seven research departments and three research \ninstitutes,  covering  a  wide  range  of  policy  issues.  It  also  has  an  information  center  that \nmaintains a comprehensive databank of qualitative and quantitative data. DRC will designate a \nsenior staff member as the TA coordinator and assign two full-time counterpart staff to work with \nthe  consultants.  DRC  will  also  arrange  the  logistics  for  the  field  studies  in  the  two  study \nprovinces  and  facilitate  the  consultant  team\u2019s  access  to  participating  central  government \nagencies.  \n \n18.  DRC  will  form  an  interagency  steering  committee  by  January  2006  to  guide  TA \nimplementation. The steering committee will build broad support across key agencies for the \nfinal PRR and will be the conduit for each ministry to add its action plan contributions to the draft \nPRR. Dialogue on strategic and technical issues will be facilitated through workshops and \ninformal  meetings.  This  will  be  discussed  in  detail  at  TA  inception  to  clearly  indicate  the \ncomposition and specific responsibilities for effective implementation of the TA.  \n \n19.  The steering committee will be chaired by the DRC and will comprise representatives of \nthe Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Civil Affairs, Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Education, \nMinistry of Health, and Ministry of Labor and Social Security. The steering committee will ensure \nbroad stakeholder ownership of the process, which will help the TA promote an integrated \napproach to enhancing poor urban migrant access to public goods (education, health care, \nhousing, and employment services). Active dialogue with international organizations9 involved in \nurban migrant studies and projects will help ensure consistency and avoid duplication of effort. \n \n20.  DRC will oversee the production, review, and revision of the PRR by the consultant, and \nwill be responsible for its delivery to the State Council for consideration. The FSR will be \nproduced in Chinese and English and distributed to key stakeholders to maximize its impact.  \n \n21.  In addition to staff participation, DRC will provide: (i) a suitably furnished office with \nutilities and telecommunication access; (ii) city transport for consultants; (iii) materials, data, and \n                                                 \n9  During TA preparation, extensive dialogue was undertaken with donor agencies including DFID, World Bank, and \nCIDA to ensure complementarity of effort. This dialogue will be maintained during TA implementation.  \n ", "  5\ndocuments required by the TA; and (iv) a proportion of the budget for field travel of one staff \nmember to accompany the consultants.  \n \n22.  The consultants will submit to the Government and ADB an inception report within one \nmonth of commencement of services, with a firm timetable for the execution of the TA and the \nlist of the two cities selected for the field studies; an interim report; a draft final report (including \nthe FSR and PRR); and a final report. The draft final report will be submitted to relevant line \nministries for their review and comments, which are important to ensure the TA\u2019s success.   \n \nIV.

The consultant team will consist of one international and four domestic consultants. In \nclose cooperation and consultation with the Executing Agency (EA) of the technical assistance \n(TA)\u2014Development  Reform  Center  (DRC)  of  the  State  Council\u2014consultants  will  lead  the \nimplementation and delivery of the outputs described below and any specific task requested by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2.  The  consultant  team,  working  closely  with  the  DRC,  will  be  responsible  for  two  key \noutputs: (i) a field studies report (FSR), and (ii) a policy recommendations report (PRR) to be \nproduced in Chinese and English. These will be based on field studies in two municipalities and a \nseries of workshops. In addition to their specific duties, consultants will contribute to collective \ntasks such as preparing, facilitating, and following up on tasks for workshops and reports. The \nconsultant  team  should  preferably  be  gender  inclusive.  The  consultant  team  will  review \ninternational  literature  and  practices  on  urban  migration  and  refer  to  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  for \ndeveloping  city  development  strategies.1  These  guidelines  present  the  results  of  a  TA  that \ndeveloped and introduced the concepts and techniques for preparing city development strategies \nand cities without slums programs. It includes case studies that suggest that, for cities to benefit \nfrom their comparative advantages, they must become more efficient, govern well, and establish \ncoherent poverty reduction programs. The consultant team will also conduct a general review of \nthe  residential  registration  system  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  provide \nrecommendations to reform the system to improve poor migrants\u2019 access to public goods.  \n \nA.  International  Consultant:  Urban  Poverty  Specialist  (international  4  person-months, \nintermittent within 1 year). \n \n4.  The international consultant will have substantial experience in rural-urban migration, \npoverty reduction, and urban development in ADB\u2019s developing member countries, preferably in \nthe PRC. The consultant should have demonstrated superior ability in organizing national and \nregional workshops, and excellent analytical and writing skills. Familiarity with ADB and other \nbilateral  and/or  multilateral  projects  and  TA  will  be  an  advantage.  The  international  joint-\ncoordinator will bring knowledge of international urban migrant access experience to the Project \nand should have field experience in dealing with urbanization, poverty, and migrant issues in the \nPRC.
