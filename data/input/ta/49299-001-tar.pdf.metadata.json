INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In  January  2015,  the  Government  of  Mongolia\u2019s  National  Statistical  Office  (NSO) \nrequested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance for compiling the material flow, energy, \nand environmental tax accounts within the framework of the System of Environmental-Economic \nAccounting (SEEA).1 The technical assistance (TA) would establish improved assessment and \nmonitoring  arrangements  for  the  key  indicators  that  cover  Mongolia's  green  development \nagenda: material flow, energy, and environment tax accounts under the SEEA. The support \nwould  help  to  implement  the  government\u2019s  National  Program  for  Development  of  Official \nStatistics, 2016\u20132020. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  In 2014, through its Green Growth Policy, the government formally adopted the green \neconomy concept as a vehicle to attain sustainable development and reduce poverty. The policy \naims to change previous \u201cgrow first and clean it up later\u201d practices into more environment-\nfriendly, nonpolluting, and effective production systems to increase productivity. Its goal is to \ncreate inclusive and participatory economic growth, and increase the quality of life. Specific \nchallenges for Mongolia include poverty, unequal income distribution, natural resource-based \neconomic structure, inefficient use of energy and resources, wasteful consumption, technical \nand technological obsolescence, and vulnerability to climate change. To address such concerns, \nthe promotion of the concepts of green economy, green production, and green growth aims to \ncreate economic systems with low carbon emissions, efficient use of natural resources, and \navoidance of environmental pollution and degradation. \n \n3.  In 2010, the Mongolian Parliament approved the National Program for Development of \nOfficial Statistics, 2011\u20132015, which initiated data collection and analysis necessary to support \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. The program specifies that accounts for environmental-\neconomic accounts will be constructed, data sources will be generated, and relevant estimates \nwill be made. To strengthen monitoring and quantifying of the implementation of its green \ngrowth policy and actual practices, the government decided to adopt and implement the first \ninternational  statistical  standard  for  environmental-economic  accounting\u2014SEEA  2012\u2014\nrecommended by the United Nations to its member countries. The SEEA is a multipurpose \nconceptual  framework  for  understanding  the  interactions  between  the  economy  and  the \nenvironment, and for describing stocks and changes in stocks of environmental assets.2 \n \n4.  The SEEA\u2019s central framework covers measurement in three main areas: (i) the physical \nflow  of  materials  and  energy  within  the  economy  and  between  the  economy  and  the \nenvironment;  (ii)  the  stocks  of  environmental  assets  and  changes  in  these  stocks;  and  \n(iii) economic activity and transactions related to the environment. While the SEEA system \ncomprises a series of more than 20 accounts, a country often chooses to implement only a \nselection  of  the  accounts  depending  on  the  specific  environmental  issues  it  faces. 3 \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 November 2015. \n2  Mongolia is one of four pilot project countries for Supporting Developing Countries Measure Progress towards \nAchieving a Green Economy, a project organized by the United Nations Statistical Division. NSO will (i) implement \nactivities to assess the current green economy, (ii) measure the transition process, and (iii) define indicators for \nmeasuring green development in 2014\u20132015. http://unstats.un.org/unsd/greeneconomy/Default.aspx?Lg=E \n3  In practice, environmental-economic accounting includes the compilation of physical supply and use tables, \nfunctional accounts (such as environmental protection expenditure accounts) and asset accounts for natural \nresources. \n ", "2 \nMeasurement in these areas is translated into a series of accounts and tables, as described in \nseveral United Nations\u2019 manuals.4 \n \n5.  NSO  began  by  prioritizing  the  compilation  of  the  material  flow,  energy,  and \nenvironmental  tax  accounts,  all  covered  in  the  SEAA  and  considered  critical  to  monitor \nMongolia\u2019s green growth aspirations. In 2014, NSO initiated work on compiling the material flow \naccount for 2005\u20132013 on an experimental basis. Although a good start was made, the exercise \nhighlighted the complexity of the process. Some national data used for compiling the material \nflow account were unavailable; international data were used instead. A solid survey is needed to \ndevelop the national data and indicators required for compiling the account. \n \n6.  In parallel, Mongolia participated in discussions to establish mechanisms to monitor the \nnew  set  of  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  which  build  upon  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  and  converge  with  the  post-2015  development  agenda.  Each  of  the  \n17 SDG goals, agreed on 25 September 2015, have specific targets to be achieved by 2030.5 \nADB is ready to provide support adapted for its developing member countries to respond to \nspecific regional, national, and local challenges.6 It recognizes that the SDGs are likely to be \ncustomized to regional, national, and local contexts given the enormous diversity of Asia.7 \n \n7.  The  Government  of  Mongolia,  through  NSO,  is  seeking  support  to  strengthen  the \ncapacity of NSO and relevant agencies for monitoring implementation of its green growth policy, \nin particular regarding the key indicators: material flow, energy, and environmental tax accounts \nunder Mongolia\u2019s SEEA. The government decided to focus its initial efforts on the accounts \nmost relevant to current issues. The material flow will focus on natural resources exploitation \nand usage, an important part of Mongolia\u2019s economy. The energy account is important to \nensure energy supplies during long and cold winter. Lastly, environmental taxes are considered \nkey to ensure the efficient usage of limited resources and reduce pollution.  \n \n8.  Mongolia\u2019s  efforts  to  implement  the  selected  accounts  will  support  monitoring  and \nachieving the environmental targets of the newly adopted SDGs, with 169 proposed targets and \n304 proposed indicators of compliance, which include the country's SDG implementation and \nreporting.  The  prioritized  SEEA  accounts  specifically  contribute  to  the  development  and \nmonitoring of systems for (i) goal 2: end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, \nand  promote  sustainable  agriculture;  (ii)  goal  7:  ensure  access  to  affordable,  reliable, \nsustainable,  and  modern  energy  for  all;  (iii)  goal  8:  promote  sustained,  inclusive,  and \nsustainable economic growth, and full and productive employment and decent work for all; (iv) \ngoal 12: ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns; and (v) goal 15: protect, \nrestore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and sustainable forests; combat \ndesertification; halt and reverse land degradation; and halt biodiversity. \n \n                                                \n4  United Nations.

Groff,  ADB  Vice-President  (Operations  2)  at  the  United  Nations  Sustainable \nDevelopment Summit on 27 September 2015 in New York (as drafted). http://www.adb.org/site/post-2015/main \n7  Similar  initiatives  are,  for  example,  taken  by  the World  Bank-led Wealth  Accounting  and  the  Valuation  of \nEcosystem  Services  partnership,  which  includes  Indonesia  and  the  Philippines  as  the  first  pilots.  Wealth \nAccounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services is a global partnership that aims to promote sustainable \ndevelopment by ensuring that natural resources are mainstreamed in development planning and national economic \naccounts. http://www.wavespartnership.org/en \n ", "3 \n9.  The TA will support Mongolia\u2019s strategic priorities identified in ADB\u2019s interim country \npartnership strategy, 2014\u20132016 and country operations business plan, 2015 for Mongolia.8 The \nTA  aims  to  strengthen  environmental  rehabilitation  and  protection,  including  adaptation  to \nclimate change. In particular, it will strengthen implementation of statistical accounts and tools to \nmonitor sustainable economic growth, as promoted in the Green Development Policy. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be improved integration of the efficient use of natural resources into \neconomic development planning for Mongolia. The outcome will be improved monitoring for \ngreen economic development.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The  TA  aims  to  establish  improved  collection,  assessment,  and  monitoring \narrangements for key indicators that cover Mongolia's green development agenda: material flow, \nenergy,  and  environmental  tax  accounts  under  the  SEEA.  The  TA  will  support  strategy \ndevelopment  through  surveys,  literature  reviews,  surveys,  data  collection,  analysis  and \nassessments, and information-sharing. \n \n12.  Output  1:  National  methodology  for  compiling  the  three  accounts  for  green \ndevelopment indicators finalized. The final methodologies for the establishment of the three \naccounts will be reviewed, discussed, and drafted. While general directions are provided under \nthe SEEA\u2019s central framework, the specific application and requirements need to be adapted to \nMongolia\u2019s specific conditions.9 NSO initiated some preliminary work for the energy account, \nwhich will be used to complete specific methodologies, data collection protocols, and processing \nsystems. The data processing systems will be integrated into the existing NSO database. \n \n13.  The proposed 39 indicators, together with the anticipated linkages with the SDGs, are \nsummarized in the supplementary appendix. Each account will have 13 indicators, which are \nconsidered most relevant. \n \n14.  Specific activities for output 1 include  \n \n(i)  review  and  assess  the  concepts,  definitions,  principles,  and  international \npractices for environmental accounting; \n(ii)  review and establish linkages with SDG reporting requirements; \n(iii)  prepare and report Mongolian concepts, definitions, and principles for the three \naccounts; \n(iv)  develop the sampling procedures and questionnaires; \n(v)  develop and update the data processing systems and databases; and \n(vi)  finalize  the  findings  in  a  methodology  in  Mongolian,  complemented  with  an \nEnglish summary. \n \n                                                \n8  ADB.  2014.  Interim  Country  Partnership  Strategy:  Mongolia,  2014\u20132016.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2015  Country \nOperations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2015. Manila. \n9  A first step to adapt to the specific conditions in Mongolia is the selection of the 13 indicators for the 3 priority \naccounts, out of the more than 20 accounts of the SEEA system. \n ", "4 \n15.  Output  2:  Data  for  compilation  of  the  three  accounts  collected  and  reported. \nEstablishment  of  the  account  requires  extensive  data  collection,  which  needs  to  be \nrepresentative of Mongolian conditions. Based on the agreed methodologies and available \nbudget, aimags will be identified for the data collection.10 The data collection will make use of \nadvanced internet-based sampling technologies, which NSO is already using. Where necessary, \nNSO information technology staff will update the NSO database structures. \n \n16.  Specific activities for output 2 include  \n \n(i)  prepare practical guidelines for enumerators in Mongolian language; \n(ii)  conduct field surveys for data collection, following the developed methodologies; \n(iii)  control, analyze, and interpret data; and \n(iv)  publish reports for the three accounts. \n \n17.  Output 3: Monitoring and data analysis capacity of the National Statistical Office \nand relevant agencies strengthened. Environmental accounting methodologies and practices \nwill be shared and integrated into Mongolia\u2019s green development monitoring and reporting. \nWhile NSO will be the central agency to present the collected statistical information, close \ncooperation will be needed with relevant sector agencies, notably the Agency for Land Relations, \nGeodesy,  and  Cartography;  the  Forestry  Research  Development  Center;  the  General \nDepartment of Taxation; the Ministry of Environment, Green Development and Tourism; the \nMinistry of Finance; and the Ministry of Energy (supplementary appendix).11 Workshops will be \norganized to discuss and present the findings, and promote the integration of the findings into \nsector  strategies.  The  NSO  publications  will  be  presented  at  international  conferences  in \nregional member countries. The activities are to be implemented in parallel with outputs 1 and 2. \n \n18.  Specific activities for output 3 include  \n \n(i)  undertake consultation workshops with relevant agencies; \n(ii)  present findings of the account reporting at international conferences; \n(iii)  conduct workshops on the usage and implementation of green growth monitoring; \nand \n(iv)  summarize the findings in a technical report. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $780,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office facilities, data processing, meeting \nvenues, local transportation in Ulaanbaatar, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2018. NSO will be the \nexecuting agency. It will establish a project implementation unit with about nine qualified staff. \nThe unit will be responsible for the overall planning, coordination, and supervision of the TA. It \n                                                \n10  An aimag is the Mongolian equivalent of a province. \n11  In 2014, NSO and the Ministry of Environment, Green Development and Tourism signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding to promote cooperation on environmental statistics. \n ", "5 \nwill closely work together with the Ministry of Environment, Green Development and Tourism \nstaff, who will be invited to join the project implementation unit and TA activities.  \n \n21.  Four individual consultants will be engaged to support NSO: an environment (energy) \nspecialist (international, 4 person-months); an environment economist (international, 4 person-\nmonths); a project management expert (national, 22 person-months); and a statistician (national, \n20  person-months).  Consulting  services  are  needed  for  methodology  development,  data \ncollection, training, and project coordination (Appendix 3). ADB will engage the consultants \nfollowing its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using \nthe individual consultant selection method. The consultants are expected to be mobilized during \nthe first quarter of 2016. Procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Purchased equipment will be turned over to \nNSO upon completion of TA activities. The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  One full-time administrative support staff will be engaged (22 person-months) to assist \nNSO in administering the TA, and organizing workshops and training. Resource persons will be \nengaged for a maximum of 10 working days, using single source selection, to participate in and \nmake presentations during the in-country workshops and training. \n \n23.  NSO will administer the data collection surveys, training workshops, and conferences for \nwhich an advance payment facility will be established. NSO has the capacity to manage the \nfunds, as it has experience working with regional ADB TA projects using an advance payment \nfacility. NSO has also worked with other international partners (e.g., the Economic and Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific, the International Labour Organization, the United Nations \nIndustrial Development Organization, and the World Bank). \n \n24.  The  TA  will  follow  the  standard  monitoring  and  supervision  procedures  for  ADB-\nadministered  TA.  The  TA  implementation  and  supervision  will  be  conducted  in  close \ncooperation  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  economists  from  the  Sustainable  Development  and \nClimate  Change  Department  and  the  Economic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation \nDepartment. Best practices and lessons will be disseminated through technical workshops and \nthrough various technical reports, knowledge products, and other publications posted on the \nNSO and ADB websites.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Mongolia  for  Strengthening  Capacity  for  Environmental-Economic \nAccounting, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance Project is Aligned with \nIntegration of efficient use of natural resources into economic development planning improved \n(National Program for Development of Official Statistics 2016\u20132020 [draft]; Green Development Policy of \nMongolia, 2014). \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2018:     \nImproved  Baselines for three groups of key  Project technical and  Institutional \nmonitoring for  green development indicators  progress reports   coordination \ngreen economic  established for Mongolia\u2019s Green  among \nNSO periodic bulletins \ndevelopment  Development Policy (2015  government \nand assessment reports \napplied  baseline: 0)  agencies on \nenvironmental \nmonitoring is not \nadequate. \nOutputs  By 2018:     \n1.
