INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Central and West Asian countries are heavily reliant on either fossil fuels, hydropower, or \nimported fuels and power, which make them carbon-intensive, energy-insecure, and vulnerable \nto climate and external supply shocks. The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims \nto pilot test and build expertise on the emerging floating solar photovoltaic (FPV)1 technology to \ndiversify  the  energy  mix,  increase  energy  security,  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) \nemissions. 2    Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  represent  these  critical \nvulnerabilities of Central and West Asian countries and are the targeted beneficiaries.3  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Energy Policy 2009; the energy sector group work plan, 2018\u2013\n2019;  and  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Strategy  2030  and \nWork Plan, 2016\u20132020.4 The TA outcome will contribute to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ntarget of providing at least $6 billion in climate financing annually from 2020. The countries \nrequested the TA and agreed with the scope during reconnaissance missions in November 2017 \nand January 2018.5 All member countries concurred with the TA concept at the CAREC Energy \nSector Coordinating Committee (ESCC) meeting in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan in March 2018. The \nTA  is  not  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plans  and  regional  cooperation \noperations business plan.6 The concept clearance was obtained on 6 June 2018. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Power supply in Afghanistan is 80% imported, while 85% of power in Azerbaijan is \nsupplied from fossil fuel-based plants. In the Kyrgyz Republic, 90% of power is from hydropower \nplants (Table 1a).7 All countries have little or no installed solar capacity despite rapid cost \nreductions in the last 5 years and supporting policies. This is due to lack of awareness, and \ninsufficient technical skills and knowledge on the costs, benefits, and financing options.  \n  \n4.  The availability, suitability, and cost of land for solar energy are additional constraints to \nits development. Land with competing uses, such as agriculture and housing, is expensive, and \nhilly terrains are costly to develop and prepare for land-based solar projects. However, the \n                                                \n1  A photovoltaic cell is a specialized semiconductor diode that converts light (photons) to electricity (voltage). \n2  Compared with about 400 gigawatts of installed land-based photovoltaic capacity worldwide, only 106 FPV plants \ntotaling 211 megawatts (MW) were in operation by the end of 2017. Japan has the most number of plants. The \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China has the largest, at 40 MW, and is constructing 150 MW and 70 MW plants. Several plants \nare in operation in 17 countries, such as Italy, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on \n22 March 2018. \n4  ADB. 2009.

(TA-9299-REG). \n7  Other Central and West Asian countries are less energy insecure, have a relatively diversified energy mix which \nincludes solar, adequate institutional capacity and have promoted private sector participation in renewable energy. \n ", "2 \ncountries have large lakes and reservoirs with perennially sunlit surfaces. The installation of FPV \non these water bodies optimizes the use of water and solar resources, diversifies the energy mix, \nenhances energy security, and avoids emissions. The total installed generation capacity of the \nregion is only a fraction of the potential FPV capacity on the region\u2019s hydropower reservoirs alone. \nWith the existing grid infrastructure for hydropower, the cost of installing FPV is reduced while the \npower density in megawatts (MW) per flooded area is significantly increased.8 The FPV output \nalso allows time-shifting of hydropower output, creating a virtual pumped storage capability.9 \nMoreover, FPV installed in reservoirs used for drinking water, fishing, irrigation, and hydropower \nhas added environmental benefits. It reduces evaporative losses (water conservation) and algal \ngrowth, increasing water clarity and resulting in plant growth, increased oxygen, and fish growth.  \n \nTable 1: Installed Generation Capacity, Solar Potential and NDC Targets \n Aspects      Afghanistan  Azerbaijan  Kyrgyz Republic \nTotal  520  7,905  3,786 \n1a.

Solar  energy  is  inexhaustible  and  available  year-round,  and  photovoltaic  cost-\neffectiveness is proven globally. Land-based and floating photovoltaic are sustainable options, \ngiven that (i) the countries have adequate solar resources (Table 1b), (ii) photovoltaic is becoming \neven more cost-effective, (iii) photovoltaic is quick to install, and (iv) photovoltaic mitigates climate \nchange while enhancing energy security. Photovoltaic development also supports the countries\u2019 \nnationally determined contributions targets to reduce GHG emissions by 2030 (Table 1c). \n \n6.  The TA will pilot test high technology, enabling the countries to leapfrog in knowledge and \ncapacity and increase readiness for private sector participation in large-scale, land-based, and \nfloating solar development. The TA will also address critical challenges and vulnerabilities such \nas (i) insufficient technical and institutional capacity, (ii) limited financial resources, (iii) tariffs \nbelow cost recovery, and (iv) energy insecurity due to reliance on a single type of energy source. \n \n7.  Afghanistan remains in the lowest 5% of electricity use globally, with only 30% of the \npopulation connected to the grid. Domestic capacity is only 520 megawatts (MW); and imports \nfrom Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan account for 80% of the power supply.10 \n                                                \n8  The added cost of the floating structure could be compensated through savings from land acquisition and preparation. \n9   FPV helps to meet demand surges during the day and save water for hydropower plant operation at night. \n10  The cost of energy imports increased 14 times from $16 million in 2007 to $224 million in 2016. \n ", "3 \nUnreliable supply and lack of grid connection have caused reliance on expensive (about $0.50 \nper kilowatt-hour) and carbon-intensive diesel generation. The country aims to diversify into \nrenewable energy and encourage private sector participation, but its inaccessible and insecure \nland, and limited baseload generation and grid capacity, have hindered solar development. \n \n8.  In Azerbaijan, oil and gas supply over 90% of power while hydro accounts for 7%. The \ngovernment aims to diversify its energy mix and improve sector efficiency, but the low user tariffs \nhinder investments in renewable energy. A 2016 Presidential decree mandated reforms to \ndevelop non-oil sectors, increase the use of domestic resources to free up oil and gas for \nadditional export revenues, and incentivize private sector entry into renewable energy.11 The high-\ncost, limited availability, and competing uses of land have stalled photovoltaic development. \n \n9.  The Kyrgyz Republic relies heavily on hydropower, which represents 80% of capacity and \n90% of supply. It is a net electricity exporter, but a net importer of fossil fuels to feed cogeneration \nplants in winter when reservoir water is low. Excess water is spilled without generating electricity \nin the summer, while coal-based plants supply the winter electricity shortage. The country needs \nto diversify to clean year-round power generation sources as the seasonality of hydropower \nthreatens its energy security and increases emissions. The country\u2019s rugged terrain and low user \ntariffs have contributed to the lack of investments in solar and other clean technologies. \n \n10.  While FPV requires stricter standards, given the exposure to water, it has advantages over \nland-based photovoltaic, as it (i) frees up land for other uses and saves on land acquisition and \npreparation costs, (ii) allows higher yields because of the cooling effect of water, (iii) conserves \nwater through reduced evaporation, (iv) has readily available water for module cleaning, and (v) \nis quick to install. FPV systems have been largely installed on lakes, irrigation ponds, and \nreservoirs. Some plants have been built and tested in marine environments, and pile- or stilt-\nmounted plants have been installed over aquaculture farms, canals, and wetlands.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) selected countries\u2019 energy security \nenhanced;12 and (ii) GHG emissions reduced.13 The TA will have the following outcome: utility-\nscale floating solar projects in selected countries initiated. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  The TA will have the following outputs: (i) pilot-scale floating solar plants installed and \nscaled  up  plants  assessed  in  selected  countries;  (ii)  business  models  with  private  sector \nparticipation developed; and (iii) institutional capacity in designing, constructing, and operating \nfloating solar photovoltaic systems enhanced. \n \n                                                \n11 Government of Azerbaijan. 2016.

Output 1: Pilot-scale floating solar plants installed and scaled-up plants assessed \nin selected countries. Output 1 will be delivered by installing three pilot FPV systems of up to \n100 kilowatts (kW) AC (alternating current) each.14 The systems will comprise photovoltaic panels, \na floating platform, an anchoring or mooring system, an inverter and power conditioner station \n(land-based or above the water), cables, grid connection infrastructure (including a battery energy \nstorage system as appropriate), and auxiliary facilities. Ground-mounted photovoltaic systems of \nup to 5 kW AC each will be installed next to the FPV systems to enable performance comparison \nand facilitate hands-on technical training. Photovoltaic is a proven technology, but the floating and \nmooring systems associated with FPV are new, high-level technologies. The physical activities \non the selected pilot plant sites must have minimal or no environmental impacts. Three design\u2013\nbuild\u2013operate (DBO) contracts will be procured under the TA. The three 105 kW AC pilot projects \nare expected to avoid about 140 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per year in total.15 \nBased on the findings of the pilot projects, the TA will develop feasibility studies for utility-scale \nfloating solar plants in the same sites using the business models formulated under the TA. \nPotential for scale-up and replication in other water bodies will also be assessed. Safeguards \nassessments will be done on the scaled-up projects and an environmental assessment and \nreview framework will be prepared to guide these future projects and ensure compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n14.  Output 2: Business models developed with private sector participation. Output 2 will \nbe delivered by (i) assessing current policy, laws, regulations, and tariff structures; and identifying \ngaps or shortcomings that hinder the development of solar and renewable energy; (ii) formulating \nfinancing plans after market analyses; (iii) identifying and assessing  suitable business models for \nthe selected countries\u2014public, public\u2013private partnerships, independent power producers, and \nother  suitable  modalities\u2014with  several  different  ownership  and  operational  options,  while \nensuring  adequate  balancing  of risk  and  benefits; (iv) recommending  the  most  appropriate \nbusiness model for each target country; describing the stakeholders\u2019 roles, responsibilities, and \nrisks; and incorporating findings in the feasibility studies; and (v) recommending action plans to \npromote solar photovoltaic, and creating an enabling environment for private sector participation. \n \n15.  Output 3: Institutional capacity in designing, constructing, and operating floating \nsolar photovoltaic systems enhanced. Output 3 will be delivered through intensive capacity \nbuilding of stakeholders. The pilot projects will serve as platforms for hands-on technical training \non both land-based and floating photovoltaic to build local expertise in designing, constructing, \nintegrating, operating, and maintaining photovoltaic systems. Regional conferences and study \ntours to leading FPV countries will be also be conducted.16 Government and local experts will \nwork with and learn from international experts, owners, operators, suppliers, and manufacturers \nof floating photovoltaic. International consultants will support and train the implementing agencies \nand project management units (PMUs) in supervising and managing contractors.  \n \n16.  Output deliverables will be disseminated in digital publication format to the countries at \nworkshops, trainings, and meetings through ADB, implementing agencies, and the CAREC ESCC.  \n \n17.  The following project sites, identified and agreed with the countries during the fact-finding \nmissions, have diverse water characteristics and uses and therefore allow different designs, \ncomponents, and configurations to be assessed and pilot tested for optimum learning:  \n                                                \n14 The FPV plant capacity and configuration depend on the site and are limited by the TA pilot-testing budget.  \n15 ADB. 2017.

Manila.  \n16 The TA consultant will organize study tours to FPV plants in different stages of development in leading FPV countries \n(e.g., Japan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea) to ensure a deep understanding of FPV. \n ", "5 \n(i)  Afghanistan. The Qargha dam and reservoir in Kabul is a 50-hectare recreational \narea planned to be developed for trout fishing and hatchery. It is also planned to \nsupply additional drinking water to Kabul, provide irrigation to expand horticulture, \nand  feed  a  hydropower  plant.  FPV  on  Qargha  lake  contributes  to  water \nconservation for more drinking and irrigation water while providing much needed \nelectricity to the grid. Increasing the supply of reliable energy to facilities around \nthe lake could contribute to increases in tourist numbers and revenues. The Naghlu \nreservoir 40 kilometers (km) east of Kabul will also be assessed for suitability. It \nhas electrical and grid infrastructure via the 100 MW Naghlu Hydropower Plant, \nthe country\u2019s largest. A 20 MW land-based photovoltaic plant is expected to be \nbuilt 2 km from the reservoir under an approved ADB grant tranche, and an \nadditional 20 MW is planned under a future tranche.17 Qargha lake could fit up to \n25 MW, while the Naghlu reservoir could fit over 200 MW of FPV.18  \n(ii)  Azerbaijan. Lake Boyukshor, the largest of 9 lakes in Azerbaijan\u2019s Absheron \npeninsula, is saline and was used as a dumping site for sewage and oil effluents. \nA 2012\u20132015 lake remediation program cleaned 300 out of the 1,100 hectares and \nbuilt a promenade and park on its bank fronting the Baku Olympic stadium. \nRemediation of the remaining 800 hectares is ongoing and tourism is expected to \nincrease with this program. FPV installation could demonstrate climate-resilient \nlake restoration while displacing fossil-fuel-based power in the distribution network. \nThe lake could theoretically fit at least 500 MW of FPV. \n(iii)  Kyrgyz Republic. The 284 km2 Toktogul reservoir feeds a 1,200 MW hydropower \nplant and provides 40% of power supply in the Kyrgyz Republic.19 FPV could \nbalance the seasonality of the hydropower plant with a year-round solar generation. \nProviding  frequency  regulation  of  the  500-kilovolt  transmission  system,  the \nToktogul  hydropower  plant  exports  power  and  provides  irrigation  water  to \nUzbekistan. The lake could theoretically fit over 20 gigawatts of FPV. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,000,000, financed on a grant basis by the Clean Energy \nFund20 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. Eligible \nexpenditures  include  consulting  services,  training  and  workshops,  and  equipment.  Pilot \nequipment costs shall not exceed 30% of the ADB-administered financing amount. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n19.

Consulting services. ADB will engage consultants following ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions.25 An international consulting firm, with 127 person-months of international and \nnational  consultants  over  30 months,  will  be selected through the quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method using full technical proposal. The ratio of quality against cost will be 90:10 given \nthe relatively new technology. Individual consultants and resource persons (5 person-months of \ntotal inputs) engaged will be considered for lump sum and/or output-based contracts. \n \n23.  Pilot testing of project approach. DBO contractors will deliver three pilot projects of up \nto 105 kW AC each. Pilot plants procured under the TA will be transferred to the respective \ngovernments upon TA completion following ADB\u2019s PAI 5.09 para. 68.26 ADB will own the pilot \nprojects during TA implementation, then hand them over for the implementing agencies to own \nand operate from TA completion. The TA consultant will develop feasibility studies of scaled up \nplants on the same sites based on the findings of the pilot projects. For the scaled-up projects, \nsafeguards due diligence will be conducted following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; and \nrelated reports, plans, and monitoring and management plans will be developed and incorporated \ninto the tender documents. Counterpart in-kind contribution, including allocation of project sites \nand permits or clearances, and implementation arrangements were agreed with the beneficiary \ncountries during the fact-finding missions in November 2017 and January 2018. The TA meets all \ncriteria for pilot testing of a project approach.27 \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s procurement. All procurement, including the three DBO contracts for the pilot \nprojects of up to 105 kW AC, will be done by the TA consultant on behalf of ADB, following ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Policy  and  the  associated  PAIs  and  TA  staff  Instructions,  and  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), in collaboration with the \nimplementing agencies and PMUs. ADB will sign the contracts. The size and cost of each pilot \nproject will be confirmed pending required due diligence during TA implementation to determine \nthe optimum configuration, design, and components for each pilot plant. Pilot project costs will \nnot exceed 30% of the ADB-administered financing amount. \n  \n25.  Cofinancier requirements. The TA implementation will follow the additional monitoring \nand reporting requirements specific to the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility (footnote 20).28 \n \nIV.
