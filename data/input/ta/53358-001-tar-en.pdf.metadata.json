INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  involve  research  and \ndevelopment, policy advice, and capacity development on issues facing the developing member \ncountries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), in line with Strategy 2030\u2019s operational \npriority  6:  Strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.1 These  activities  will  entail \npartnerships  with  prominent  researchers  from  leading  national  and  international  research \ninstitutions on frontier development topics and methodologies. Collaboration activities will include \nenhancing the quality of ADB publications such as the Asian Development Review (ADR); co-\norganizing prominent knowledge-sharing events such as Asian Development Conferences; and \ninviting speakers to share development ideas with ADB on cutting-edge, creative, and sustainable \nsolutions to address DMCs\u2019 development challenges. \n \n2.  Two previous TA projects focused on establishing global research alliances.2 The first was \na pilot small-scale TA approved in April 2010 that supported  ADB\u2019s collaboration with the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China and selected leading universities. The second TA, \nwhich will be completed in December 2019, was approved in December 2011 for an increased \nnumber of knowledge partners and covering a broader scope of collaboration. It supported a joint \nstudy on food security and established knowledge partnerships and networks with the Asian and \nAustralasian  Society  of  Labour  Economics  (AASLE),  the  Philippine  Economic  Society,  the \nIndonesia Regional Science Association, and the Asian Workshop on Econometrics and Health \nEconomics. It also brought an Asian perspective to global events such as the Emerging Markets \nForum. \n \n3.  These partnerships helped enhance the profile and quality of ADB\u2019s knowledge products \nand facilitated the efficient use of TA funds by identifying knowledge partners that share the \nresearch priorities of ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD). \nThis knowledge and support TA will seek to actively broaden the research areas covered by the \npartnerships and further expand the list of knowledge partners. A component of this TA was \noriginally included in ERCD\u2019s 2020 annual work program, but it was advanced to 2019 approval \nand combined with other similar TA components.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  DMCs  face  development  challenges  that  are  increasingly  becoming  more  complex, \nespecially because of the impacts of the Fourth Industrial Revolution4 on jobs, the adverse effects \nof climate change, rapidly aging societies, and growing urbanization. DMC policy makers must \neffectively analyze these development challenges and recommend appropriate solutions. In most \ncases, however, domestic capabilities are inadequate to independently undertake empirical \nanalyses and generate sound policies. DMC policy makers need a steady supply of quality \nevidence-based studies that address the complex questions they must deal with. Therefore, this \nTA aims to identify the pressing development issues faced by DMCs (particularly those belonging \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Establishing Global Research Alliances. Manila (TA 7514-REG); and ADB. \n2011. Technical Assistance for Establishing Global Research Alliances (Phase 2). Manila (TA 7972-REG). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 October 2019. \n4  Technological advancements that define the Fourth Industrial Revolution include artificial intelligence, quantum \ncomputers, biotechnology, blockchain technology, three-dimensional printing, and new generation robotics.  \n \n ", "2 \nto groups A and B of ADB\u2019s classification of DMCs) and offer innovative analyses that will help \nthem devise policy reform measures suitable to their specific conditions.5  \n \n5.  Under Strategy 2030, ADB will further strengthen its role as knowledge provider and \nconvener of partnerships. ADB will work closely with DMCs to identify their needs and create the \nknowledge products and services most relevant to them. At the same time, ADB will collaborate \nwith diverse partners and stakeholders within and outside Asia and the Pacific region to be able \nto present the most innovative solutions to DMCs\u2019 development challenges. \n \n6.  ERCD, in line with Strategy 2030 priorities, identified its strategic research areas beginning \nfrom 2020 as (i) skills and jobs; (ii) macroeconomic resilience, including debt sustainability and \nfiscal policy; (iii) infrastructure deficits; (iv) urbanization; (v) gender equality and demographic \nchanges; (vi) regional cooperation and integration; and (vii) disaster risk management and climate \nchange. ERCD research will focus on these areas but will flexibly respond to emerging challenges \nand areas as requested by DMCs. To implement its research program, ERCD will strengthen its \nalliances with respected regional and global research institutions and development partners. Such \nalliances have proven helpful, particularly in (i) establishing a wider research network and \nimproving access to a larger pool of talent, (ii) enhancing ADB\u2019s capacity to produce innovative \nknowledge solutions, (iii) strengthening ADB\u2019s role in convening policy dialogue to craft policy \noptions, (iv) disseminating knowledge solutions more widely through its partners networks, and \n(v) ultimately further raising the profile of ADB as a knowledge institution. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: analytically sound and research-backed \ndevelopment policies formulated in DMCs.6 The TA will have the following outcome: policy \ndiscussions and formulation by DMC officials and the general research community supported.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output  1:  Findings  of  research  outputs  and  conferences  on  key  and  frontier \ndevelopment challenges reported to key DMC agencies and think tanks. ERCD will continue \npartnerships with leading research institutions from within and outside the region. The TA will \nsupport primary socioeconomic policy think tanks in DMCs that (i) share ERCD\u2019s research \ninterests, (ii) require capacity development, and (iii) have a direct link with DMC policy makers \nand planners. By leveraging DMC think tanks, ERCD hopes to contribute to the crafting of \ndevelopment policies, plans, and programs that are based on sound research evidence. The TA \nwill consider collaborating with the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, the Centre for \nEconomic  and  Social  Development  (Myanmar),  the  Economic  Policy  and  Competitiveness \nResearch Center (Mongolia), the Center for Economic Development (Uzbekistan), the University \nof the South Pacific (Fiji but catering to the research needs of Pacific Island countries), and The \nNational Research Institute (Papua New Guinea). \n \n \n5  ADB\u2019s Classification of DMCs. https://www.adb.org/site/public-sector-financing/lending-policies. \n6  ADB. 2018.

Operational priority 6: strengthening governance and institutional capacity (footnote 1) and the aim of \nstrengthening DMCs\u2019 institutional capacities in addressing development issues. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \n9.  The TA will also consider partnerships with regional academic associations such as the \nAASLE and the East Asian Economic Association and co-organize sessions during their annual \nconferences. These partnerships will allow ADB to benefit from exchanging research ideas with \nthe associations\u2019 network of economists in all economic fields for the East Asian Economic \nAssociation and in applied microeconomics (labor and human capital) for AASLE. Respected, \ninternationally peer-reviewed economic journals will publish ERCD papers presented in the \nAASLE and the East Asian Economic Association conferences. \n \n10.  In addition, ERCD will continue to pursue its previous partnership with the Emerging \nMarkets Forum, as long as the research areas remain complementary. The forum was created \nas a not-for-profit initiative to bring together high-level government and corporate leaders from \naround the world to engage in dialogue on the key economic, financial, and social issues facing \nemerging market economies. \n \n11.  The TA will also support collaboration with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development on (i) studying leading development issues for selected ADB DMCs, (ii) co-\npublishing a report on tax statistics, and (iii) undertaking research on disaster risk management. \nDuring implementation, the TA will identify other partners of high caliber to collaborate on other \nareas of research, such as (i) the role of behavioral economics in developing effective policy \nmeasures, (ii) using big data analytics, and (iii) further studying the impact of technology on jobs. \n \n12.  The TA will determine the DMC agencies that would most likely benefit from the TA\u2019s \nknowledge  products  and  inform  the  agencies  of  the  research  findings  and  policy \nrecommendations through mission consultations, workshops, and other outreach events. The TA \nwill  proactively  undertake  dissemination  activities  for  these  knowledge  products  in  close \ncoordination with the resident missions. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Asian  Development  Review  issues  published  and  effectively \ndisseminated. The TA will support the continued publication of the ADR, which features research \non development issues relevant to countries of Asia and the Pacific. Published by MIT Press, one \nof the world\u2019s most prestigious academic publishers, the ADR produces high-quality empirical \npapers, survey articles, historical analyses, and policy-oriented work. The ADR\u2019s journal ranking \nis on a gradual, upward, long-term trajectory and is more consistent than those of its peers such \nas the Asian Economic Papers, the Asian Economic Policy Review, the Asian Economic Journal, \nthe Journal of Asian Economics, and the African Development Review.8 During 2016\u20132018, ADR \nspecial issues have covered topics on Asia\u2019s structural transformation, the climate change \nchallenge to the region\u2019s development, urban and regional development, and potential growth of \neconomies in the region. In view of the rapidly growing elderly population in many developing \nAsian economies, the next ADR special issue, targeted for publication in 2021, will focus on \ndemographics and aging societies. \n \n14.  The ADR\u2019s principal source of high-quality papers is the annual ADR conference, co-\nchaired  by  a  guest  editor  who  invites  internationally  known  academicians  to  present  their \nproposed papers for the ADR. Other sources of high-quality papers are (i) the enhanced editorial \nsystem, which has attracted more unsolicited submissions; (ii) general invitations for paper \nsubmissions from events sponsored by other think tanks; and (iii) direct invitations to ADB staff \nand consultants, who have produced high-quality ADB economics and regional cooperation \n \n8  The rankings are based on Scimago Journal Ranking, which is a measure of scientific influence of a journal that \naccounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where \nsuch citations come from. \n ", "4 \nworking  papers  and  background  papers  for  the  ERCD  flagship  publications,  i.e.,  Asian \nDevelopment Outlook, Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific, and Asian Economic Integration \nReport. \n \n15.  For 2020, the TA will initiate the annual Asian Development Conferences, which will be \nco-organized  with  well-established  regional  research  institutes.  ERCD  is  considering  co-\norganizing the first Asian Development Conference in 2020 with the Korea Development Institute \non the topics of economics of demography and population aging. The ADR will also source papers \nfrom invited speakers for the Distinguished Speakers Program, Asia Development Policy Lecture \nSeries, Asia Thought Leadership Series, and regular ERCD seminars. These knowledge events \n(i) support the wider dissemination of revolutionary ideas and frontier research methodologies in \naddressing the region\u2019s development challenges and (ii) provide a platform for leading analytical \nminds to share cutting-edge ideas on development. The TA will invite policy makers and young \nresearchers working on frontier topics and methodologies to use these venues to present their \nresearch work. \n \n16.  ADR issues will be posted on the MIT Press and ADB websites and highlighted in the \nposting call for papers in major journal websites (e.g., Economics Research Network, Social \nScience Research Network, and Research Papers in Economics). The TA will distribute printed \ncopies of the ADR through ADB\u2019s resident missions to DMC economic planning agencies, libraries, \nand think tanks. The TA will develop a more aggressive marketing campaign in collaboration with \nADB\u2019s Department of Communications to enhance the visibility of the ADR to improve readership \nand paper submissions. \n \n17.  The TA will publish free electronic versions of the knowledge products generated under \nthis TA and disclose them to the public, and will disseminate a limited number of printed copies \nto key stakeholders or upon demand only. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6 and TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will administer the TA. ERCD\u2019s Office of the Chief Economist and Director General \nwill  be  responsible  for  supervision  and  management  of  consultants,  procurement,  and \naccomplishment of the outputs. The TA will involve knowledge partnerships or cooperation \narrangements with leading international and national research institutions within and outside the \nregion. ERCD will refer to the database on research institutions with knowledge partnerships \nand/or cooperation arrangements with ADB, maintained by the Knowledge Advisory Services \nCenter, to leverage previous successful partnerships. This TA will make best use of k-Nexus and \ncoordinate with sector and thematic groups to minimize the risk of duplicating other departments\u2019 \npast and ongoing efforts. The planned TA outputs will be entered into k-Nexus to build upon ADB\u2019s \naccumulated knowledge and experience. Further, to ensure operational relevance of the TA, \nERCD will implement a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach and rely on the country expertise, government \nrelations, and other support of relevant operations departments in developing knowledge products \nand identifying potential knowledge partners. ADB will obtain a no-objection letter from the \nrelevant DMC prior to conducting or financing any TA activity in the DMC. \n \n ", "5 \n20.
