INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2011 country programming review mission, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for preparing a biodiversity strategy and action plan (BSAP) for \nYunnan Province.1 The TA is a 2012 standby in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2012\u2013\n2014 for the PRC. In July 2012, an ADB mission visited the PRC and reached an understanding \nwith  the  government  on  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Biodiversity conservation in the PRC is conducted under the framework of the national \nbiodiversity strategy and action plan (NBSAP), 2011\u20132030.2 Released in 2011, the NBSAP sets \ntargets for national conservation and commits provinces to prepare provincial BSAPs. Three \nBSAPs have been or are nearly completed, for Chongqing, Guangxi, and Sichuan. Others are in \nprogress, but many provinces have little technical guidance on how to develop these plans. \n \n3.  Yunnan Province is a global biodiversity hotspot. Located in the southwestern PRC, it is \nthe most species-rich province in the nation, with over 50% of the PRC\u2019s vascular plant and \nvertebrate fauna species, 16% of its endemic flora, and 73% of its priority protected animals \n(243 of 335 species).3 Parts of Yunnan are listed in the NBSAP as high-priority regions for \nbiodiversity. Ecosystems in the province range from subtropical lowland forests near sea level to \ntemperate forests, glaciers, and high-altitude wetlands at over 6,000 meters on the Qinghai\u2013\u2013\nXizang Zizhiqu 4 plateau. Yunnan\u2019s biodiversity values are matched by its cultural richness: 25 \nof the PRC\u2019s 55 ethnic minorities reside in Yunnan, of which 15 are found nowhere else.5 The \nsocial, economic, and spiritual livelihood of these groups is closely linked with biodiversity. \nYunnan is one of the PRC\u2019s poorest provinces, with over 75% of the population engaged in \nagriculture  and  5.6  million  people  earning  an  annual  income  below  CNY300.6 Extensive \neconomic development is under way, and central Yunnan is highlighted in the PRC\u2019s Twelfth \nFive-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 for a new round of development.7 Biodiversity and minority cultures \ndrive a rapidly expanding tourism industry. However, this growth is at risk. Yunnan\u2019s biodiversity \nis under severe threat, largely from unsustainable development that is causing the landscape-\nlevel loss of natural habitats and declines in species populations. \n \n4.  Yunnan has some of the PRC\u2019s most important hydrological resources, encompassing \nparts of the headwaters and lower reaches of six major rivers: the Dulong (Irrawaddy), Lancang \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 November 2012. As agreed with \nthe executing agency, the original TA title, Strategy and Action Plan for Biodiversity Protection in Yunnan, has \nbeen amended to reflect standard terminology for a biodiversity strategy and action plan. \n2  Ministry of Environmental Protection. 2010.

These \nrivers extend for over 1,000 km, through other provinces in the PRC or the downstream nations \nof Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. As \npart of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS),8 Yunnan shares over 4,000 km of international \nborders  with  Myanmar,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  and  Viet  Nam.  These \ntransboundary regions and rivers support globally significant wetlands and forests and provide \ncritical ecosystem services to over 100 million people. Yunnan thus plays a critical role in \nmaintaining regional forest and water resources for five nations in addition to the PRC. \n \n5.  No  analysis  of  provincial  conservation  priorities  has  been  undertaken  for  Yunnan. \nPriority-setting studies have been conducted for some landscapes and species, especially in \nnorthwestern and southern Yunnan, and provide a partial foundation for conservation planning. \nDespite this, conservation efforts are skewed to some landscapes and high-priority species, \ndevoting less attention to other sites and species. The provincial protected area system does \nnot correlate with species richness, endemism, or threat, such that some reserves have little \nconservation value while some important sites lack protection.9 \n \n6.  In 2011, in response to the NBSAP, the Yunnan Environment Protection Department \n(YEPD) commissioned the preparation of a draft provincial biodiversity strategy, 2012\u20132030 by \nthe Academy of Biodiversity Conservation Research of Southwest Forestry University. The \npublic release of the final draft is planned for December 2012, but the draft table of contents of \nwhat is still an internal government document, provided by the YEPD, indicates that the strategy \nwill describe some of Yunnan\u2019s priority species and crosscutting links with integrated water \nresources  management  (IWRM),  poverty  alleviation,  tourism,  community  livelihoods,  and \nclimate change. Preliminary reviews of the draft by the YEPD, national experts, and civil society \norganizations have raised concerns about (i) the lack of a rigorous technical approach based on \ninternational best practice to identify and rank conservation priorities for species and sites, (ii) \nthe need to revise and strengthen the draft strategy, and (iii) the need for a 5-year action plan to \nbegin implementing the strategy under the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020. The Yunnan \nprovincial government has concluded that preparing an effective BSAP requires the application \nof international good practices in conservation planning and additional funding. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA will facilitate the preparation of a BSAP for Yunnan Province. It will (i) implement \na systematic planning process to identify biodiversity conservation priorities; (ii) revise the draft \nprovincial strategy, 2012\u20132030; and (iii) prepare a 5-year action plan to implement the strategy \nduring Yunnan\u2019s 13th plan. It will identify priority projects, a budget for the first 5 years of BSAP \nimplementation, and sources of financing. TA completion will coincide with the preparation of \nYunnan\u2019s 13th plan, providing a timely opportunity for the BSAP to facilitate the integration of \nbiodiversity conservation into sector plans. For this TA, \u201cbiodiversity\u201d refers only to vascular \nplants (those with tissues that circulate nutrients through the plant) and vertebrate fauna (birds, \nmammals, amphibians, reptiles, and fish) and their habitats. Other biodiversity is beyond the TA \nscope. The BSAP will strengthen conservation in Yunnan by \n(i)  providing a provincial framework that supports the NBSAP; \n                                                \n8  The Greater Mekong Subregion encompasses Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, \nThailand, and Viet Nam, as well as, in the PRC, Yunnan Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. \n9  H. Xu et al. 2008. Biodiversity Congruence and Conservation Strategies: A National Test. BioScience 58. pp. 632\u2013\n639. \n ", "  3 \n(ii)  identifying species and sites of highest provincial conservation priority; \n(iii)  designing  a  conservation  network  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitats to  yield \noptimal results for conservation; \n(iv)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  YEPD  to  plan  and  prioritize  conservation \ninitiatives,  particularly  by  providing  technical  skills  in  systematic  conservation \nplanning and species ranking, which can be applied to other species and sites in \nYunnan beyond the TA; \n(v)  promoting the mobilization of funding sources for biodiversity conservation; and \n(vi)  developing strategies and projects that link biodiversity conservation with related \nissues,  particularly  IWRM,  poverty  alleviation,  climate  change  adaptation, \nimproved management of soils and forests, and the importance of community-led \ninitiatives. \n \n8.  The  expected  impact  of  the  TA  is  improved  management  of  natural  resources, \nparticularly biodiversity, in Yunnan Province. It is expected that by 2020 (i) the 5-year action \nplan will be incorporated into provincial sector plans, (ii) about 10 new management activities \nidentified by the TA will be implemented in 10 conservation areas, and (iii) none of the highest-\npriority vertebrate fauna identified in the TA will have become extinct in Yunnan. \n \n9.  The expected outcome of the TA is an established provincial framework for biodiversity \nconservation in Yunnan Province. This is to address the development problem that conservation \nefforts in Yunnan are not being planned or implemented systematically or efficiently. By 2014, \nthe BSAP is expected to be approved by the biodiversity conservation liaison office (BCLO), a \nhigh-level provincial committee, and the amount in the YEPD\u2019s annual fiscal budget allocated to \nbiodiversity conservation from 2015 is expected to increase by about 10%. \n \n10.  The BSAP will contribute to national and international conservation objectives. The TA \nsupports the goals of the PRC\u2019s 12th plan, 2011\u20132015 which emphasizes the importance of \nbiodiversity conservation; the NBSAP, which requires provinces to prepare BSAPs; and over 10 \nother national strategies up to 2050 that include targets for threatened species, protected areas, \nforests, wetlands, poverty alleviation, and ethnic minorities. Internationally, the TA supports the \ngoals of the Convention on Biological Diversity, to which the PRC is a signatory, and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2013Association of Southeast Asian Nations Strategy on Environmental \nProtection  Cooperation,  2009\u20132015,  which  promotes  regional  collaboration  for  biodiversity \nconservation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The expected outputs of the TA are (i) an analysis of biological conservation priorities for \nYunnan Province completed, (ii) a comprehensive BSAP for Yunnan Province prepared, and (iii) \ngovernment capacity in conservation planning strengthened. The TA will (i) identify priority \nspecies; (ii) analyze likely threats, including climate change, and propose how to mitigate them \nand strengthen resilience; (iii) analyze gaps in the protected area network and recommend how \nto address them; (iv) provide training in conservation planning; and (v) prepare the final draft \nBSAP. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months. During months 1 and 2, the YEPD and TA \nconsultants will (i) review the current institutional framework, sector biodiversity plans, and \nprevious  priority-setting  exercises  and  conservation  initiatives  in  Yunnan;  (ii)  assess  local \ncapacity  in  conservation  planning;  (iii)  compile  necessary  data  and  geographic  information \n ", "4   \nsystem data layers; and (iv) facilitate the establishment of a working group that includes experts \nand civil society organizations to develop the BSAP. \n \n13.  From months 3 to 9, the YEPD and TA consultants will (i) identify species and sites of \nhighest provincial priority, based on a technical ranking of selected vertebrate fauna, vascular \nplant species, and sites; (ii) prepare geographic information system data layers and maps; (iii) \nrecommend how to strengthen the provincial conservation network of terrestrial and wetland \nhabitats,  based  on  existing  protected  area  coverage,  the  presence  of  target  species  and \necosystems, management status, and the potential impacts of climate change; and (iv) initiate \ntraining  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  YEPD  and  other  natural  resource  management \nagencies in conservation planning and implementing the BSAP. \n \n14.  During months 10 to 18, the YEPD and TA consultants will (i) hold provincial workshops \nto inform and jointly review TA results; (ii) develop management strategies for priority species \nand sites, including determining specific projects to be implemented under the 5-year plan; (iii) \ndevelop sector strategies, especially to establish links on such crosscutting themes as IWRM, \npoverty alleviation, and climate change; (iv) develop a financial assessment for the BSAP, \nincluding sustainable and innovative sources of funding; (v) develop budget requirements and \nallocation; (vi) develop an implementation framework; and (vii) prepare a comprehensive BSAP. \nADB and YEPD, supported by the TA consultants, will jointly prepare a knowledge product on \nthe BSAP geared toward policy and decision makers.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $660,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $200,000 by the \nMulti-Donor Trust Fund10 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility to be administered by \nADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, \ndomestic  transport,  remuneration  and  per  diem  for  counterpart  staff,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The  YEPD  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA.  The  YEPD  is  responsible  for \ncoordinating the development and implementation of provincial environmental policies, including \nbiodiversity conservation, and has shown strong capacity to execute ADB-assisted projects. \nSince 1995, the YEPD has been the executing agency for the Yunnan component of the ADB \nGreater Mekong Subregion Biodiversity Corridors Conservation Initiative. It is now administering \nthe Yunnan component of phase 2 of this initiative and is familiar with ADB procurement and \nfinancial management procedures. \n \n17.  A TA management office will be established in the YEPD to administer the day-to-day \nactivities of the TA and coordinate with ADB. The YEPD will provide office space, access to \ncommunications and copiers, and logistical support for TA implementation. The director of the \nTA management office will manage and liquidate funds provided by ADB and the government \nfor training and workshops. \n \n18.  Provincial  decision-making for  biodiversity  conservation  in  Yunnan  is guided  by  the \nbiodiversity conservation liaison committee, a group comprising the most senior officials of the \n                                                \n10  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n ", "  5 \nYunnan provincial government. Its activities are administered through the BCLO, which brings \ntogether senior representatives of the YEPD and the forestry, agriculture, land and resources, \nand finance departments. The BCLO will be the steering committee for the TA. The biodiversity \nconservation liaison committee and the BCLO are established structures within the Yunnan \nprovincial government and provide a strong framework for TA implementation. The BCLO will \nmeet at the inception, midterm, and final stages of TA implementation and when important TA \noutputs are produced, and it will ensure that the committee is kept updated on TA progress. \n \n19.  The tentative starting date for the TA is 1 April 2013 and the closing date 30 September \n2014. A consultant team hired through the TA will conduct most of the technical work to achieve \nthe  outputs. The team will  be  supported  by  the  YEPD  and  a  working group  of additional \nresource personnel comprising local experts, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders \nas necessary, to help address specific topics or issues. The activities of the consultant team and \nworking group will focus on technical assessments, surveys, workshops, capacity development, \nand facilitating the participatory development of TA outputs. Five reports will be prepared during \nthe TA: inception, midterm, and final TA progress reports prepared 4 weeks, 9 months, and 18 \nmonths, respectively, after TA commencement; the draft BSAP, prepared 15 months after TA \ncommencement; and a knowledge product prepared 18 months after TA commencement. The \nreports will be subject to review by ADB and the government. The TA progress reports and \nknowledge product will be written in English and translated into Chinese. The draft BSAP will be \nwritten in Chinese and translated into English. The outline terms of reference for consultants is \nin Appendix 3, and the outline of the draft BSAP is in Appendix 4. \n \n20.  The TA consultants will be engaged through a firm and provide 4.5 person-months of \ninternational and 32.25 person-months of national specialist services. ADB will engage the \nconsultants following its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The consulting firm will be selected using simplified technical proposals and quality- and \ncost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost weighing ratio of 90:10. This high weighting for quality \nis justified by the technical complexity of the TA, which requires interdisciplinary specialist skills \nin biodiversity, climate change, IWRM, conservation financing, and specialist software, and is \nnecessary  to  ensure  that  international  standards  of  conservation  planning  are  achieved. \nEquipment for the TA will be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time) and handed over to the YEPD upon TA completion. Disbursement \nunder the TA will be in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time), with Water Financing Partnership Facility funds front-loaded. ADB \nwill field inception, midterm, and final review missions to review TA progress and will maintain \nregular communications with the YEPD and the consultancy firm throughout the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant \nbasis to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Biodiversity Strategy and \nAction Plan for Yunnan Province, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with 2012 Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2020:    Assumption \nImproved  Five-year action plan  Yunnan Thirteenth Five- YPG committed to \nmanagement of  incorporated into sector plans of  Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 and  implementing the \nnatural resources,  relevant departments (e.g.,  sector plans (especially  BSAP \nparticularly  forestry, tourism, water, and  environmental protection,   \nbiodiversity, in  construction)  forestry, tourism, water, and Risk \nYunnan Province  Baseline: 0, target: 1  agriculture departments)  Key threats to target \n    species not \nAbout 5 new management  YEPD annual yearbook of  alleviated \nactivities identified in the BSAP  environmental protection \nimplemented in 5 conservation  (YEPD website) \nareas, including protected areas   \nand community-managed areas,   \nby 2018   \nBaseline: 0, target: 5 activities, 10  \nsites   \n   \nNone of the highest-priority  YEPD provincial list of \nvertebrates identified in the TA  priority species (2012); and \nbecoming extinct in Yunnan  publications and reports on \nBaseline: 0 extinct in 2012, target: the highest priority \n0 extinct in 2020  vertebrates \nOutcome  By 2014:    Assumptions \nAn established  BSAP approved by BCLO by  BCLO letters of support for  Sufficient and timely \nprovincial framework December 2014  BSAP to YPG  understanding and \nfor biodiversity  Baseline: 0, target: 1    commitment from \nconservation in      relevant departments \nYunnan Province  Annual fiscal budget of the YEPD  Budget drafts at the   \nallocated to biodiversity  protected area,  BCLO and YEPD \nconservation planned for 2015  departmental, and/or  accorded sufficiently \nonwards increased by about 10% provincial level  strong mandate to \nBaseline: CNY4 million in 2012  lead \n(10% of YEPD budget in 2012),  interdepartmental \ntarget: 10% increase  coordination \nOutputs  By 2014:    Assumption \n1.
