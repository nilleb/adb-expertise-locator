Investment in roads is\npart  of  a  continuing  program  to  support  the  development  of  an\nintegrated  and  balanced  road  network  in  the  country.  The\nimprovement of feeder and district roads to all-weather maintainable\nstandard  will  establish  effective  communications  to  serve  major\nagricultural production centers and other socioeconomic facilities. The\nconstruction of a new district headquarters access road will establish\neffective connections between district communities and the national\nroad network. Ensuring the EWH is in a maintainable condition is\nessential  for  supporting  domestic  trade  and  promoting  the\ndevelopment  of  subregional  activities.  Strengthening  institutional\ncapacity for preserving the existing asset base of the road network is\nneeded to improve efficiency in road maintenance.\nObjective and Scope The  principal  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Government\nimprove  transport  efficiency  and  thereby  enable  the  country  to\nstimulate  economic  growth  and  job  creation,  leading  to  poverty\nreduction. The Project will maintain about 140 kilometers (km) of the\nEWH, improve approximately 165 km of roads to all-weather paved\nsurface, construct a district headquarters access road of about 96 km\nusing  environment-friendly,  labor-based  construction  methods,\ndevelop  and  implement  performance-based  maintenance  on  about\n200-300 km of the network, and improve about 10 km of a cross-\nborder access road. The Project will induce more efficient movement\nof  goods  and  passengers,  provide  better  access  to  income  and\nemployment  opportunities  and  to  education  and  health  centers;\nimprove public sector implementation and maintenance capacity in the\nroad sector; support development of private sector capabilities to carry\nout road improvement and maintenance by contract; improve road\nsafety  and  axle-load  control;  and  provide  community  access  and\ncomplementary facilities through a participatory approach leading to\npoverty reduction.", "iii\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $69.5 million equivalent,\nincluding service charges during construction.

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Road Network Development Project; and (ii) the proposed\nadministration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant for the Project to be provided\nby the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. Nepal is a landlocked country with a population of approximately 23.2 million people. It is\none of the poorest countries in the world. In 2000, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was\nless than $245, making Nepal one of the poorest countries in the region. Several structural\nfactors hinder the country's attempts at development: (i) the difficult terrain of a mountainous,\nlandlocked country; (ii) heavy dependence on subsistence agriculture; (iii) low levels of physical\ninfrastructure and human capital; (iv) low domestic resource mobilization and the consequent\ndependence on international assistance; (v) inadequate institutional capacity for development\nmanagement; and (vi) lack of good governance.\n3. Official  development  assistance  is  derived  from  bilateral,  multilateral,  and\nnongovernment organization (NGO) resources. The principal bilateral sources are Denmark,\nGermany, Japan, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. Among the multilaterals,\nADB and World Bank are the largest loan providers. The United Nations system is the largest\nmultilateral grant provider.\n4. The transportation system in Nepal depends heavily on the road network. Although\nconsiderable  rehabilitation  has  taken  place,  the  network  must  be  extended  to  provide  the\npopulation with access to social services, trade, and employment opportunities that will allow\nthe country to achieve acceptable levels of economic growth. Much of the existing network is\nunpaved and requires upgrading to provide all-weather passage. A large part of the paved road\nnetwork  has  deteriorated,  and  improvement  and  rehabilitation  are  needed  to  bring  it  to  a\nmaintainable condition. While supporting continuation of these efforts, ADB will increasingly\nfocus on maintenance issues, as the preservation of road assets is recognized as equally\nimportant in developing the road sector.\n5. The  proposed  Project  was  developed  in  response  to  the  Government's  transport\ndevelopment emphasis on expanding the country's transport facilities to ensure more balanced\ndevelopment throughout the country, and specifically to provide links to districts currently not\nserved by roads. The roads covered by the Project lie in the eastern and central parts of the\ncountry and represent important links that can contribute to economic growth and poverty\nreduction. The Project will address the important sector issue of promoting the development of\nlocal private sector contractors capable of improving and maintaining roads. The Project will\nalso assist the Government's Department of Roads (DOR) to improve its capacity to manage\nroad maintenance works through a program of performance-based maintenance (PBM).\n6. The Project has been formulated on the basis of the findings of the technical assistance\n(TA) for the feasibility study,1 the draft Transport Sector Strategy Paper,2 discussions with the\nGovernment and other agencies active in the sector, the findings of the various project missions\n                  \n1  TA 2969-NEP: Fourth Road Improvement, for $775,000, approved on 24 December 1997.\n2  ADB. 2001.

Fact-finding\nfor the Project was completed during 19 March - 9 April 2001, and the Appraisal Mission was\ncarried out during 27 June - 11 July 2001.3 The project framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  The Sector\n1.  General\n7. The economy of the country depends largely on the performance of the rural sector.\nAgriculture is one of the most important activities, accounting for 41 percent of FY2000 gross\ndomestic product and about 76 percent of total employment.4 However, the population living in\nrural areas has a low per capita income, poverty is widespread, and basic physical and social\ninfrastructure is lacking.\n8. About 42 percent of the population live below the national poverty line of NRs4,400\n(about $77) per capita per annum, which is based on minimum caloric intake, housing, and\nother nonfood standards.5 This figure varies widely across the country. Twenty-three percent of\nthe urban population and 44 percent of the rural population do not have sufficient income to\nmeet basic consumption needs.\n9. Taking a broader view of human deprivation than the simple income measure, Nepal is\nranked 144th of 174 countries in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s 2000\nHuman Development Report.6 The people in the poorest regions also have the lowest access to\neducation and basic health service, and highest rates of infant mortality and child malnutrition.\nThe human literacy rate of individuals age 6 and above is 38 percent. However, only 20 percent\nof the poor are literate compared with 60 percent of those in higher-income groups. Poverty also\nheightens gender differences. While 32 percent of poor men are literate, the literacy rate of poor\nwomen is much lower at 9 percent. Poverty induces malnutrition and frequent illnesses forcing\nhouseholds to spend their precious resources on medical care. In turn, illiteracy, malnutrition,\nand disease reduce development and employment opportunities, worsening poverty. The major\nchallenge  facing  Nepal  is  to  overcome  this  vicious  cycle  of  poverty  and  low  human\ndevelopment.\n10. Absence  of  roads  acts  as  a  significant  bottleneck  to  increasing  productivity  in  the\nagriculture sector. Inputs cannot be delivered at the right place and at the right time in the\nabsence of roads. Thus farmers are not able to specialize to take advantage of higher-valued,\nmarketable  niche-type  products.  Productivity-raising  services  and  inputs  tend  to  be\nconcentrated in the more accessible areas, and marketable crops also tend to be grown mainly\nin those areas, leaving the remoter parts to suffer from persistently low productivity and income.\nThus large segments of the population living in areas with no or at best very minimal seasonal\nroad accessibility are poor in terms of income and other human development attributes.

Road transport generally provides the primary\naccess between different areas of Nepal. It is the only mode of transport for the bulk of goods\nand people, accounting for most passenger transport and nearly all freight transport. As a result,\nthe  social  and  economic  well-being  of  Nepal  is  heavily  dependent  upon  an  effective  and\nsustainable road network.\n2.  Planning, Coordination, and Administration\n11. The National Planning Commission sets overall development objectives and coordinates\nthe investment programs of external agencies and individual government agencies. The Ministry\nof Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) has prime responsibility for planning, formulating\npolicies, and managing all land transport facilities, including roads and bridges. The Ministry of\nLocal Development is responsible for district roads.\n12. Within  MPPW,  DOR  is  responsible  for  network  planning,  design,  construction,  and\nmaintenance of the country's strategic road network; and municipalities are responsible for\nurban roads. The Department of Transport Management, within the Ministry of Labor and\nTransport  Management,  is  responsible  for  regulating  road  transport,  including  vehicle\nregistration and licensing. The Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural\nRoads, within the Ministry of Local Development, is responsible for coordinating and facilitating\nthe rural infrastructure development process throughout the country and for providing technical\nguidance and support at the local level.\n13. DOR is headed by a director general who is assisted by deputy directors general in\ncharge of DOR's various administrative and technical branches. Administration of ADB-financed\nroad projects is carried out by a DOR division, the Project Directorate (ADB), headed by a\nproject director with the rank of a gazetted first class officer.7 Currently, DOR has about 300\nengineers, 600 junior engineers, and more than 1,000 technical and administrative support staff.\nDOR's present organization structure is shown in Appendix 2.\n14. Substantial efforts have been under way through partnerships between the Government\nand various external funding agencies, as part of ongoing projects, to help DOR improve its\nroad management capacity, planning and monitoring capability, and environmental and traffic\nsafety  practices.  The  results  are  noteworthy,  especially  for  improvements  in  planning  and\nimplementation. DOR has been able to develop and improve its basic capabilities to better\nmanage the road capital and resources allocated to the sector. However additional support is\nstill needed in these areas as well as for strengthening DOR\u2019s maintenance capability.\n3.  Road Network\n15. Nepal's transport infrastructure mainly consists of roads and civil aviation, dominated by\nthe  road  subsector,  which  provides  for  the  movement  of  approximately  90  percent  of  all\npassengers and freight within the country. A key part of Nepal's road system is the 4,740\nkilometers (km) Strategic Road Network (SRN), which constitutes 36 percent of the total road\nnetwork. The SRN, administered by DOR, is formed by the national highways and feeder roads.\nThe national highways consist of the East-West Highway (EWH), which acts as a backbone\n                  \n7  In Nepal, director general, deputy director general, and superintendent engineer fall under the broad category of\ngazetted first class officer.", "4\nrunning the length of the country in the terai,8 and north-south highways linking major towns that\nserve a large portion of population. The feeder roads are major links to national highways and\nprovide access to the district headquarters and places of national importance such as tourism,\nindustry, power generation, and pilgrimage sites. While the strategic network is mostly all-\nweather, only about two thirds is sealed. Other roads comprise rural roads that feed off the\nstrategic network and urban roads. The rural roads, administered by the Department of Local\nInfrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads, total about 6,615 km (50 percent) and are\nmostly earthen roads and tracks. About 1,870 km of urban roads (14 percent), a mixture of\nsealed and nonsealed roads, are under municipal administration. About a third of all urban\nroads are within the Kathmandu Valley. The road network and classification are detailed in\nAppendix 3.\n16. Despite the many positive advances achieved in the road network, Nepal continues to\nlag behind its neighbors in road infrastructure with an estimated road network of very low\ndensity\u2014about 90 meters (m) per square km or 660 m per 1,000 population (Appendix 3). Road\ncontact between Kathmandu and many district capitals, 23 of 75 districts, remains problematic.\nAbout two thirds of the road network remains unpaved and much remains impassable during the\nwet season. Although the upgrading of the EWH is nearing completion, continued attention to\nthe SRN remains essential, as parts of the network are poorly maintained or approaching the\nend of its design life and many district headquarters are not road-connected and need to be\nimproved and developed.\n17. Initiatives that have achieved success in rural (district, local) road development are the\n\"green roads\" funded by Deutsch Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and \"food\nfor  work\"  funded  by  Swiss  Development  Corporation  (SDC).  The  proposed  Rural  Access\nProgramme funded by DFID will provide a similar approach. Using a participatory planning\nprocess, those projects aim to improve access of rural communities by better siting basic\nfacilities and services for rural populations, and improving the mobility of rural people through\nlow cost roads, tracks, trails, and footbridges. At the same time, those projects have provided\nemployment opportunity to rural communities. A key theme in the process is an environment-\nfriendly and labor-based construction approach.\n4.  Traffic and Vehicle Fleet\n18. The registered motor vehicle fleet in 1999/2000 comprised 263,516 units: 53,073 cars,\njeeps, and vans; 52,534 buses, trucks, and tractors; and 157,909 motorcycles, tempos, and\nothers.  The  average  annual  growth  rate  is  about  13  percent,  with  the  highest  growth  in\nmotorcycles. An important feature of road transport within Nepal is the relatively low traffic\nvolume. Outside the Kathmandu Valley, the highest volumes are 2,500-3,000 vehicles per day\n(vpd) on the main route to the Indian border. On key links in the terai, volumes are 300-1,000\nvpd, with flows of 100-200 vpd on the main hill roads. Earth roads at the extremities of the\nnetwork may have traffic volumes of less than 25 vpd. Except around Kathmandu where cars\nare common, traffic has been dominated by buses and trucks. Data on the vehicle fleet during\n1989-1999 is shown in Appendix 4.\n5.  Road Transport Industry\n19. Both public and private industry operate road transport. Over 90 percent of passenger\ntraffic  is  carried  by  bus.  A  public  bus  company  operates  in  Kathmandu  Valley  but  most\n                  \n8  Nepal is divided into three geographic regions: the terai (flat plains), middle hills, and mountains.", "5\ninterregional passenger traffic is carried by private bus companies and operators. The road\nfreight transport industry, which carries over 90 percent of freight traffic, is dominated by private\noperators who are mostly owner-drivers. Bus fares are partially regulated by Government and\nfreight rates are determined by market forces.\n20. Historically, bus and truck operations have been controlled by operators' associations.\nMany more buses and trucks are available for hire than needed, and these associations provide\na mechanism for rationing the available work among vehicles. The Government also established\nupper limits for bus fares. However, the operators' associations have not had complete control,\nand free market services exist at lower prices; not all bus fares conform to the Government\nregulations, particularly in hilly areas and along earth roads.\n21. Bus fares are clearly related to road and terrain conditions. If roads are allowed to\ndeteriorate, bus fares will likely increase, and conversely, if roads are maintained, fare increases\nare likely to be avoided. While this general relationship exists, in practice neither the official nor\nactual fares seem to be adjusted automatically when roads are improved. Changes in fares may\noccur only over the longer term or where strong competition exists.\n22. The general relationships between road condition and freight charges also apply. Freight\nrates reflect the condition of the road and imply rates on the unpaved sections of NRs20-25 per\nton km, compared with around NRs10-12 per ton km on the paved sections. In the Far Western\nRegion, rates are generally lower and show a more marked difference between paved and\nunpaved sections. These lower rates exist despite a lower volume of back-haul freight and are\nbelieved to result from freer competition compared with stronger control over freight by truck\nowners' associations in the east. However, the general link between road condition and freight\nrates, which has underpinned the increase in trade volume, is seen in all areas.9\n6.  Road Subsector Revenues and Expenditures\n23. Government revenues from road users consist mainly of custom duties and sales taxes\non vehicles and spare parts, taxes on fuels, and road toll collection. During 1992/93\u20141998/99,\nrevenues are estimated to have increased from about NRs1.35 billion to NRs2.66 billion or\nabout a 15 percent increase per annum. These revenues are not explicitly earmarked for road\nconstruction, improvement, and maintenance. During the same period, annual expenditures on\nall types of rehabilitation and maintenance increased from about NRs858 million to NRs2,585\nmillion, accounted for about 58.4 percent and 48.5 percent of total road expenditures. However,\nthe overall coverage of road expenditures (administration, new construction, reconstruction,\nmaintenance, and others) by road revenues was 66.6 percent in 1998/99 compared with 92\npercent in 1992/93. Appendix 5 provides more details on these revenues and expenditures.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n24. Since the 1970s, the Government's main objective within the road sector has been the\ncompletion of the strategic network. With assistance from external financing agencies, the\nGovernment prepared the Priority Investment Plan 1997-2006. The plan provides a 10-year\nexpenditure plan for road development and maintenance, and serves as the general basis for\nselection  of  road  sector  support  by  ADB  and  other  external  financing  agencies.  The\nGovernment's Ninth Plan (1997-2002) has an overarching goal of poverty reduction, with a\n                  \n9  ADB. 2000. Impact Evaluation Study of the Asian Development Bank Assistance to the Road Sector in Nepal.\nManila.", "6\ntarget of reducing the poverty rate by 10 percentage points by the end of the plan period. The\nplan's  transport  policy  and  implementation  strategy  includes  (i)  repair,  maintenance,  and\nrehabilitation of highways and feeder roads; (ii) low-cost construction of first intervention roads\nto  district  headquarters  now  not  connected  to  the  road  network;  and  (iii)  labor-oriented\nconstruction methods geared to maximize local participation and address the poverty reduction\nobjective.\n25. Under the ongoing Road Maintenance and Development Project (RMDP),10 supported\nby the International Development Association, a mechanism for earmarking road user revenues\nfor maintenance is being developed through the enactment of a Nepal road board act and\nestablishment of a Nepal road board. The Government constituted the Road Management and\nFinance Reform Implementation Committee, which has six members from the private sector and\nfive from government; the committee is to prepare a reform proposal for sustainable financing\nand improved management of road maintenance through a road fund. The draft Road Board\nBill, approved by the Cabinet, is being presented to the Parliament in the 2001 session. The\nproposed road board, consisting of four members from the public sector and seven from the\nprivate  sector,  will  oversee  road  maintenance  planning  and  policy,  and  the  collection  and\nexpenditure of funds. The draft act stipulates the following possible resources for the fund: (i) a\nfuel levy on diesel (NRs1.5/liter) and petrol (NRs2.0/liter), (ii) road tolls, (iii) a heavy vehicle\nlicense  fee,  (iv)  international  transit  fee,  and  (v)  counterpart  funding  of  districts  and\nmunicipalities. The proposed act provides for (i) adjusting road user charges to reflect increased\nmaintenance needs, (ii) collecting and depositing such charges directly into the fund, and (iii)\nensuring that the fund\u2019s proceeds are used in priority for road maintenance. An annual road\nmaintenance program (ARMP) will be prepared annually by each road agency, and the road\nboard will review and consolidate the programs into a national ARMP. The national ARMP will\nbe executed on a contract basis.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n26. The  development  of  Nepal's  main  roads  has  depended  upon  substantial  foreign\nassistance. Typically, 50-70 percent of the road budget has come from foreign loans and grants.\nSince 1983, ADB has provided 6 loans totaling $152.4 million11 for the roads in Nepal. The\nWorld  Bank  has  provided  2  loans  totaling  $116.4  million.  Other  aid  agencies,  Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), DFID, GTZ, SDC, People\u2019s Republic of China, and\nIndia, have provided financing for 15 projects. External assistance for SRN development from\n1976 to 1999 is shown in Appendix 6.\n27. The main sources of assistance for roads\u2014ADB, DFID, GTZ, JICA, SDC and World\nBank\u2014have  similar  views  on  the  priorities  and  the  need  for  close  coordination  of  their\nrespective programs. A transport sector thematic assistance group of agencies funding roads\nmeets  regularly  in  Kathmandu.  In  general,  the  agencies  consider  road  transport  to  be  an\nimportant  means  of  reducing  poverty,  and  attach  priority  to  developing  the  SRN  by\nimplementing the Priority Investment Plan, and improving road maintenance by implementing\nthe ARMP being prepared under the RMDP.

Lessons Learned\n28. Since 1976, ADB has provided the Government with 6 road projects totaling $152.4\nmillion and TA totaling $3.0 million. Overall, ADB's involvement in the road subsector has been\nsignificant, addressing a large portion of the road upgrading and periodic maintenance needs of\nthe EWH as well as hill roads. ADB has financed about one quarter of road development\nexpenditure in Nepal since the 1980s.\n29. Following early experience with delays and cost overruns due mainly to inflation-related\ncost increases, the performance of ADB projects has improved considerably. The Third Road\nImprovement Project (TRIP) was completed on time and on budget, however, because of the\nshortage of funds the project was unable to complete links in eastern and far western regions.\nProject completion and project performance audit reports have been issued for all completed\nprojects.  In  December  2000,  an  impact  evaluation  study  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  road\nsubsector in Nepal was completed. The reports and study reveal that ADB's operations in the\nsubsector have been generally successful, although the projects have often been delayed due\nto difficult terrain and geographical conditions, political changes, and adverse macroeconomic\nconditions.\n30. In the hill areas, improvements to roadside and cross-road drainage included as part of\nthe roadworks have had a positive effect on managing storm-water flow and stabilizing slopes\ndisturbed by the initial construction. Some sections are unstable and prone to slides, and off-\nroad  works  in  general  have  assisted  with  the  control  of  these  areas.  The  TRIP  included\nextensive off-road bioengineering works aimed at revegetating and stabilizing slopes disturbed\nby construction. The slope protection manual prepared under the TRIP will be applied under the\nProject. Sufficient physical contingency will also be provided under the Project.\n31. Political  changes  may  delay  project  implementation,  and  adverse  macroeconomic\nconditions may affect the actual costs of implementation resulting in reduced project scope. In\nsome cases the project scope reduction may produce lower economic internal rates of return\nand unsatisfactory achievement of development objectives. Under the Project these problems\nare  being  positively  addressed  by  providing  a  sufficient  implementation  period  and\ncontingencies.\n32. The armed civil disturbance continues to pose a serious peace and security or law and\norder problem for the Government. The movement, concentrating mostly in the Midwestern and\nWestern regions, is escalating into other regions. Violence targeted primarily at the Government\nalso hinders delivery of basic services and private sector activities. The Government has taken\nmeasures, including the possible use of armed police force, to counter the civil disturbances and\nbring the deteriorating security situation under control. The Project, although located in the\nCentral and Eastern regions, will promote consultation and public participation particularly to\nincrease public awareness of the Project and to address community road-related needs. This\nmay increase public support for the Project and reduce disruptions during implementation.\n33. Experience demonstrates the importance of advance procurement action, counterpart\nstaff and funds, and community participation. The Project will allow advance action for selecting\nconsultants for detailed design and construction supervision. The issues of counterpart staff and\nfunds are addressed in the project assurances. DOR and ADB have learned from the TRIP that", "8\na  more  active  community  consultation  component  is  needed  for  the  road  design  and\nimplementation process. The TRIP experienced difficulties with community agitation over the\nneed for additional works to accommodate or facilitate communal or private enterprises. Under\nthe Project, community participation will be promoted.\n34. The evaluation impact study rated ADB's assistance as successful, although within this\noverall assessment there is variability. The EWH upgrading and periodic maintenance was\nhighly successful, while the hill road improvement and institutional strengthening assistance was\nless than successful. The provision of initial access allowing motorized transport to replace\nrelatively high-cost porter and pack animal transport produced better results.\n35. ADB's institutional strengthening efforts through TA12 have been relatively minor, but this\nis partly because of low absorptive capacity within the sector and the large effort supported by\nother external agencies. Although ADB contributed in an ad hoc manner to road planning, it\nmissed opportunities to address road development on a more comprehensive basis. The World\nBank, DFID, and SDC, among others, have subsequently been actively involved in policy\ndialogue  with  the  Government,  and  major  actions  have  been  taken  to  date,  including  (i)\ninstitutional capacity building, and (ii) road maintenance planning and funding construction and\nimplementation. ADB has been supportive of these efforts and is concentrating on ensuring that\nits operations complement these initiatives.\n36. In the hill areas, the study reveals that traffic volumes are inadequate to generate\nsufficient quantifiable economic benefits from road user cost savings to justify the expenditures\nneeded to upgrade roads to sealed all-weather status. As suggested in the study, other benefits,\nsuch as those from increased agricultural output, social improvements, or enhanced national\nintegration, must be assured, or lower-cost approaches devised, to justify expenditure on road\nimprovement in these areas. The results in the Far Western Region indicate that agricultural\ndevelopment may not necessarily follow road development, and specific interventions may be\nrequired to ensure that the expected development occurs. However, the experience in the\neastern hills shows that agricultural development may result from road development without\nmuch additional assistance. The proposed Project will complete the missing link in the Eastern\nRegion, canceled from TRIP, where economic activities are expected to increase following the\nroad  improvement.  Completing  the  link  should  result  in  achievement  of  the  development\nobjective of the TRIP. In addition, under the Project a poverty intervention in the area of hill\nroads is being proposed to ensure that the Project will bring about social improvements in the\nproject areas.\n37. The focus on using local contractors and packaging contracts into forms suitable for this\nin ADB-funded projects has contributed to the availability of work to support growth of the local\ncontracting  industry,  and  parallels  similar  increasing  use  of  domestic  contractors  by  other\nfunding  agencies  in  the  road  subsector.  The  good  performance  of  the  completed  works\nsuggests that local contractors are capable of handling most of the types of road works, except\nfor laying asphalt concrete. The quantity of such work in Nepal is relatively small, does not\nsupport the purchase of paving machines by contractors, and limits the number and location of\nasphalt plants; as a consequence, international contractor support may be needed.\n                  \n12 TA 764-NEP: Transport Sector Profile Project, for $350,000, approved on 13 May 1986; TA 824-NEP: Institutional\nStrengthening of the Department of Roads, for $335,000, approved on 2 December 1986; and TA 1216-NEP: Road\nand Road Transport Institutional Development, for $875,000, approved on 9 November 1989.", "9\nE.  ADB's Sector Strategy\n38. Over the past two decades much of ADB's assistance to the transport sector in Nepal\nfocused on improving the strategic road network. The rationale was that efficient transportation\nis essential for economic and social development. The country's SRN needed to be completed,\nand  those  parts  of  the  network  that  were  poorly  constructed  and  maintained  or  were\napproaching their design life needed strengthening or rehabilitation.\n39. In  November  1999,  ADB  adopted  poverty  reduction  as  its  overarching  operational\nobjective.13 ADB and the Government have signed a poverty reduction partnership agreement\non 21 October 2001 to outline the actions that both sides will take to address poverty in the\ncountry. The 2001 country strategy and program (CSP) update takes a very strong poverty\nreduction direction, based on the priorities enunciated in the 1999 country operational strategy,\nthe ADB poverty assessment, the Government\u2019s interim poverty reduction strategy, and the\nHigh-Level  Poverty  Forum.  The  overarching  objective  of  the  CSP  update  is  to  achieve  a\nsustainable reduction in poverty through (i) generation of productive employment opportunities\nand increased rural incomes resulting from faster and broad-based pro-poor economic growth,\n(ii) equitable improvements in basic social services to enhance human development resulting in\nreduction of population growth, and (iii) good governance. Prioritization of support for a smaller\nnumber of key sectors has been adopted. The CSP update focuses on up to seven areas,\nincluding (i) agriculture and rural development as the primary sectoral focal point; (ii) transport;\n(iii)  energy;  (iv)  finance;  (v)  education,  including  nonformal  education;  (vi)  water  supply,\nsanitation,  and  urban  development;  and  (vii)  environmental  management.  Projects  in  the\nprogram  will  be  designed  to  target  socially  excluded  groups,  and  to  reduce  poverty  and\ninequality.\n40. ADB's strategic objectives in the transport sector are to (i) continue to improve the\nexisting core network, (ii) ensure adequate funding for operation and maintenance of existing\ntransport facilities, (iii) support subregional linkages, (iv) strengthen institutions, and (v) promote\nprivate sector participation. These objectives will contribute to achieving the sectoral goal of\npromoting economic growth and thereby reducing poverty.14 A transport sector strategy for\nNepal is being prepared. The approaches of the strategy are to (i) contribute to broad-based\neconomic  growth  to  provide  the  context  and  framework  within  which  to  achieve  poverty\nreduction; (ii) target the poor to ensure that the benefits from growth reach all sectors and are\npro-poor in nature; and (iii) provide employment and work opportunities for the poor through the\nadoption of labor intensive methods for construction. The strategy has two main thrusts: (i) to\nensure continued, accelerated, and stable growth in the economy; and (ii) to improve access\ninto remote areas with high poverty levels.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n41. ADB  has  been  continuously  undertaking  policy  dialogue  on  road  issues  with  the\nGovernment; this has contributed to the improvement of project implementation performance,\nincreased  participation  of  local  contractors  and  consultants  in  road  construction  and\nimprovement,  prioritized  investment  on  SRN  development,  and  increased  priority  for  road\nmaintenance including increased annual budget and improved planning.

Manila", "10\nparticipation in road development, is continuing in close coordination with other development\nagencies active in the road subsector such as DFID, GTZ, SDC, and the World Bank. Under the\nproposed  Project,  the  principal  issues  to  be  addressed  include  improving  governance,\nperformance-based  maintenance  (PBM)  contracting,  poverty  impact  of  road  projects,  road\nsafety  and  heavy  vehicle  management,  private  sector  development,  and  subregional\ncooperation.\n1.  Improving Greater Transparency and Accountability\n42. ADB has provided two TAs15 and one loan16 to improve governance in the country.\nContracting, bid evaluation, and implementation processes in public works have been identified\nas  areas  in  which  systemic  improvements  will  reduce  corruption  and  inefficiencies.  These\nimprovements will aid project implementation. Under an ongoing ADB TA to strengthen project\nimplementation practices,17 public works directives are being prepared. The new directives will\nclearly delineate roles and responsibilities of government officials involved in all aspects of the\nproject cycle, from project design, through prequalification, tendering, and bid evaluation, to\nimplementation. The directives will outline the processes to be followed at all stages of the\nproject cycle, and will include organizational directives, standard bidding documents, procedural\ndirectives, and a compendium of reference documents. The recommendations and procedures\ncontained in the directives will be incorporated in amended financial administration regulations.\nThe directives are expected to contribute to improved transparency and accountability at all\nstages of the project cycle, particularly in prequalification, tendering, and bid evaluation.\n2.  Improving Road Maintenance Efficiency\n43. Maintenance18  has  consistently  been  underfunded.  With  substantial  development\nassistance for maintenance, the SRN condition appears to have improved over the past few\nyears,  although  much  effort  and  attention  is  necessary  for  routine  and  recurrent  road\nmaintenance. The amount actually spent on routine and recurrent maintenance is considerably\nless than the funds allocated.\n44. The ongoing World Bank-supported RMDP is developing a mechanism for earmarking\nroad user revenues for maintenance. A Nepal road board act will be enacted and a Nepal road\nboard will be established to oversee a road fund (para. 25). The fund is expected to cover about\n60-70 percent of road maintenance requirements. After passage of Road Board Bill by the\nParliament (para. 25), many follow-up actions will be needed to make the road board fully\noperational and interim support will be necessary.\n45. The current main initiative to improve road maintenance capacity is the Strengthened\nMaintenance Division Program, financed by DFID and SDC. Under the program, routine and\nrecurrent road maintenance works are being carried out by laborers who work on a length of\n                  \n15TA 3580-NEP: Strengthening Corporate and Financial Governance, for $3,300,000, approved on 14 December\n2000; and TA 3622-NEP: Institutional Support for Governance Reforms, for $1,525,000, approved on 18 January\n2001.\n16Loan 1811-NEP: Corporate and Financial Governance Project, for $7.3 million, approved on 14 December 2000.\n17TA 3306-NEP: Strengthening Project Implementation Practices, for $820,000, approved on 24 November 1999.\n18Types of road maintenance: (i) routine maintenance, such as cleaning drainage and cutting of grass, required\ncontinuously on every road; (ii) recurrent maintenance, such as repairing potholes, grading, patching, trimming,\nfilling, and resealing cracks, required at intervals within a fiscal year, to keep the pavement in good condition; (iii)\nemergency maintenance, required to deal with emergency situations such as landslide, erosion, flood, etc.; and (iv)\nperiodic maintenance, such as regraveling and surfacing, required at intervals of several years to rejuvenate the\nroad pavement.", "11\nroad and are paid per day of work. Maintenance work financed by the proposed road fund will\nbe executed by contract. Transitional activity will be needed to ensure the new system is\nimplemented smoothly and does not result in any social disruption.\n46. Under the proposed Project, the Government has agreed to develop a pilot program for\nthree-year road maintenance of about 200-300 km of road through PBM contracts tendered to\ndomestic private contractors. Roads to be maintained will be selected using the highway design\nand maintenance standard model ranking as part of the ARMP under the RMDP. Among the\nranked roads, PBM will be targeted in districts with poverty rates equal to or above the national\naverage. The Project will finance the preparation works and the first year of implementation. In\nthe second and third years of implementation, the Government will finance contractors\u2019 payment\nfrom the road fund, and will supervise and monitor the works; in this way the Project will\nencourage the Government to make the road board fully operational.\n3.  Promoting Private Sector Participation\n47. Even  though  the  policy  on  private  sector  participation  on  public  infrastructure  was\napproved by the Government in 2000, a proper legal infrastructure framework is not yet in place.\nFurthermore, the low level of traffic (generally less than 3,000 vpd) is hardly enough to attract\nprivate  sector  interest  in  exploring  concession  arrangements.  In  recent  years,  competitive\ntendering processes were introduced to encourage private sector involvement in civil works\nfinanced by external agencies. International consultants have provided project management\nassistance to the contractors they are supervising. Furthermore, in the process of establishing\nthe road fund board and draft road board act, a viable partnership between the public and\nprivate sector has developed. The road fund should also help strengthen the private sector by\ncreating jobs and providing continuous contracts for maintenance.\n48. Under previous projects, ADB encouraged the Government to improve conditions under\nwhich the local contracting industry could develop. Importantly, the Government reduced or\neliminated customs duties and sales taxes on imported construction equipment. While the\ndomestic contractors have performed adequately, their most serious concern is that the work\nunder all funding sources is not continuous but is intermittent and thus has not contributed to\nsound development of local contractor capabilities. Under the Project, more than a half of all\ncivil works packages will be procured using local contractors. In particular, a pilot PBM program\nwill be developed and may be replicated for future road maintenance. This may expand the\nvolume  of  work  and  provide  a  more  stable  flow  of  work,  thus  helping  develop  the  local\ncontracting industry.\n4.  Improving Road Safety and Axle-Load Control\n49. The  increase  in  vehicle  density,  together  with  lack  of  road  safety  measures,  poor\ndiscipline and enforcement, and poor roadworthiness of vehicles, has led to increases in road\naccidents. In 1994, Nepal experienced 63 deaths per 10,000 vehicles, one of the highest rates\nof road accident fatalities in the world. 19\n50. Traffic accident data are not yet collected comprehensively or systematically in Nepal.\nThe Traffic Engineering and Safety Unit (TESU) established in DOR in 1994 with aid from DFID,\nhas collected traffic accident data and conducted safety audits for a very limited number of\nroads within the urban limits of Kathmandu Valley. Individual police stations have some data for\n                  \n19ADB. 1997. Road Safety Guidelines for the Asian and Pacific Region \u2013 Road Safety Trends. Manila.", "12\ntheir areas of responsibility, but the information varies in detail and typically covers only recent\nyears.\n51. TESU has produced a traffic sign manual, road safety notes, research reports, and a\nhighway  code;  and  conducted  training  for  traffic  police  personnel,  seminars,  road  safety\nengineering, and campaigns. However, road safety in Nepal is only slowly being accorded\nimportance; the establishment of TESU is a good first step. Expansion of more systematic and\ncomprehensive data collection is required, leading to safety audits and the identification of\nproblem  areas.  High-level  interdepartmental  coordination  is  needed.  To  improve  the\nimplementation and expansion of the existing program, the Government agreed to establish a\nroad safety committee, chaired by the DOR director general to improve the coordination of\nTESU-DOR, traffic police, Department of Traffic Management (DOTM), Ministry of Education,\nand Ministry of Health. When required, at least twice a year, the committee will meet to review\nprogress of the road safety program and resolve issues that require interdepartmental decisions\nand coordination.\n52. Successful management of heavy vehicle loads will result in more economical road\ndesigns and reduced road maintenance and rehabilitation costs. As vehicle loads become\nheavier, their damaging effect, as measured by their equivalent standard axle loads, increases\nvery rapidly and disproportionately with the actual increase in load. MPPW has, in accordance\nwith the Vehicle and Transport Management Act (1993/94), set a maximum legal limit of 10.2\nton  per  axle  for  all  vehicles.  However,  DOTM,  the  enforcement  agency,  has  neither  the\nnecessary expertise nor logistics to make any sustained effort at controlling overloaded vehicles\nand consequently the limit is not enforced.\n53. A working paper, Axle Loading on the SRN and Heavy Vehicle Management, was\nprepared by DOR's Maintenance and Rehabilitation and Coordination Unit in January 1999. The\npaper,  based  on  axle-load  surveys,  reveals  that  although  buses  and  mini  trucks  do  not\nconstitute a significant overloading problem, only 55 percent of all trucks and 28 percent of\nloaded trucks are within the present legal limit. Furthermore, almost 30 percent of traffic-related\npavement  damage  is  caused  by  the  heaviest  4  percent  of  vehicles.  A  pragmatic  and\nenforceable heavy vehicle management policy must be established and implemented and be\nacceptable to all the main agencies, such as MPPW, DOR, MPPW's Legal Section, and DOTM,\nas well as transport service organizations and Nepal Traffic Police. The Government agreed to\nproceed with the preparation of the policy through a standard committee chaired by DOR no\nlater than the end of 2002.\n5.  Promoting Subregional Cooperation\n54. ADB\u2019s activities in promoting regional cooperation accelerated significantly in the 1990s.\nThis initiative has covered technical studies and workshops to support cooperation dialogue,\nphysical investments in cross-border projects, and where appropriate, assistance for cross-\nborder agreements in Southeast Asia and Central Asia. Drawing on this experience, ADB is now\nextending this assistance to eastern South Asia, where momentum for cooperation is growing.\nThe four countries of the subregion (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal) are collectively\nknown as the South Asian Subregional Economic Cooperation initiative.", "13\n55. Under a regional TA,20 a meeting of the chambers of commerce of Bangladesh, Bhutan,\nIndia, and Nepal was held in Kolkata, India on 28-29 November 2000. The forum brought\ntogether public and private sector representatives as a step toward identifying an investment\nprogram to develop the region. The forum recognized that public-private partnerships would be\nthe main instrument of transformation, especially for undertaking infrastructure projects in the\nsubregion.\n56. Under  the  ongoing  regional  TA,21  a  one-year  study  was  launched  to  help  the\nparticipating countries identify subregional projects, prepare project profiles, and develop action\nprograms  for  subregional  cooperation  in  five  priority  areas,  namely,  transportation  and\ncommunications; energy and power; tourism; environment; and trade, investments, and private\nsector cooperation. This TA commenced with the participation of Bangladesh, Bhutan and\nNepal.  At  the  inception  meeting,  held  in  Manila  on  22  and  23  March  2001,  government\nrepresentatives confirmed that the transport sector was a priority area for initial cooperation. In\nSeptember 2001, India expressed its interest in participating in the regional TA activities. In\nOctober 2001, a Transport Working Group has started with participation of four countries in the\nsubregion.\n6.  Reducing Poverty\n57. Poverty incidence is highest in remote areas, specifically those with few roads. Poverty\nand isolation are linked: when people are isolated, they are unable to access economic and\nsocial opportunities within the wider geographic region. Isolation through poor accessibility also\nslows the diffusion of new technologies; increases marketing and production costs; limits access\nto  health,  education,  and  other  social  infrastructure;  and  limits  access  to  employment\nopportunities beyond immediate settlements. Therefore, the poverty reduction impact of road\ninvestments supported by ADB must be maximized.\n58. This is in line with the Government's Ninth Plan goal of poverty reduction. The plan\n(1997-2002), for the first time, attempted to define long-term targets for several poverty-related\nindicators  and  oriented  itself  to  achieving  those  targets.  Its  goal  is  to  reduce  the  poverty\nincidence from 42 percent in 1997 to 32 percent by 2002 and to 10 percent by 2017. The plan\nidentifies other indicators of human poverty, such as illiteracy, infant mortality rate, maternal\nmortality rate, and average life expectancy at birth, and sets targets. The approach to overall\ndevelopment and poverty reduction, and the development strategy are clearly articulated in the\nplan and other government-related documents. The strategy is three-pronged: (i) broad-based\ngrowth, (ii) social sector spending, and (iii) targeted programs for the poor and vulnerable\ngroups. Priority will be given to ensure, among other things, better accessibility to the poor and\ninaccessible areas of the country.\n59. Improving physical access in remote areas can stimulate pro-poor economic growth,\nthereby contributing to poverty reduction. The impact of road investments supported by ADB on\npoverty reduction can be maximized by targeting poorer districts, complemented by a program\nto provide or improve local access facilities (trails, pedestrian bridges, etc.); and introducing\ninnovative  approaches  to  transport  development  to  spread  benefits  more  equitably  to  the\nselected poorest districts in the project area. For instance, the Project will include a poverty\n                  \n20TA 5890-REG: First Meeting of the Private Sector Forum on Economic Cooperation in the Eastern South Asia\nSubregion, for $30,000, approved on 23 December 1999.\n21TA 5936-REG: Identification and Prioritization of Subregional Projects in South Asia, for $785,000, approved on 22\nSeptember 2000.", "14\nintervention component to improve access of the poor to the feeder roads. This will enhance\nlivelihoods and access to sustainable benefits from wider longer-term economic opportunities.\n7.  Protecting Women and Children\n60. The Government of Nepal, as a member of the International Labor Organization has\nratified seven conventions relating to fundamental work-related principles and rights including (i)\nConvention  No.  138,  Concerning  the  Minimum  Age  for  Admission  to  Employment;  (ii)\nConvention No.182, Concerning the Worst Forms of Child Labor; and (iii) Convention No. 100,\nConcerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value. ADB is\ncommitted to supporting the Government in these efforts. To ensure that gender and child\nconcerns  are  addressed,  the  Project  will  set  employment  targets  for  women  for  road\nconstruction activities, as well as require that contractors not differentiate wages between men\nand women for work of equal value, not hire children as construction laborers, and provide\nappropriate facilities for children in construction campsites. A specific clause will be included in\nbidding documents and compliance strictly monitored during project implementation.\n8.  Promoting Community Participation\n61. DOR and ADB have learned from the TRIP that more active community consultation is\nneeded during road design and implementation. Projects are delayed because of difficulty\nagreeing to compensation and community agitation for additional works to accommodate or\nfacilitate communal or private enterprises. Through its consultants, the Project will promote\nconsultation  and  coordination  between  the  district  administration,  project  officers  of  DOR,\ncontractors, communities, and NGOs.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n62. Efficient  transport,  in  particular  improved  access,  is  one  of  the  keys  to  economic\ndevelopment and poverty reduction. Investment in roads is part of a continuing program to\nsupport the development of an integrated and balanced road network in the country. The\nimprovement of feeder roads to an all-weather maintainable standard will establish effective\ncommunications  to  serve  major  agricultural  production  centers  and  other  socioeconomic\nfacilities. The construction of a new district headquarters access road will establish effective\nconnections between district communities and the national road network. Ensuring the EWH is\nin  a  maintainable  condition  is  essential  for  supporting  domestic  trade  and  promoting  the\ndevelopment of subregional activities. Institutional capacity for preserving the existing asset\nbase of the road network needs to be improved. Considering the high rate of fatal traffic\naccidents in Nepal, road safety in the country must also be improved.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n1.  Objectives\n63. The  principal  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Government  improve  transport\nefficiency  and  thereby  enable  the  country  to  stimulate  economic  growth  and  job  creation,\nleading to reduction of poverty. The Project will (i) maintain, improve, and develop the road\nnetwork to induce more efficient movement of goods and passengers, and to provide better\naccess  to  income  and  employment  opportunities  and  to  education  and  health  centers;  (ii)", "15\nimprove public sector implementation and maintenance capacity in the road sector; (iii) support\ndevelopment of private sector capabilities to carry out road improvement and maintenance by\ncontract; (iv) improve road safety and axle-load control; and (v) provide community access and\ncomplementary facilities through a participatory approach leading to poverty reduction.\n2.  Scope\n64. The scope of the Project will include (i) strengthening pavement of about 140 km of the\nEWH; (ii) upgrading approximately 165 km of feeder and district roads in the hill and terai\nregions to all-weather paved surface; (iii) constructing a district headquarters access road of\nabout 96 km using environment-friendly, labor-based construction methods; (iv) developing a\nroad maintenance program for about 200-300 km through PBM contracts; (v) improving an\naccess road for the cross-border facility in Kakarbhitta; (vi) providing community access and\ncomplementary facilities; and (vii) providing consulting services for detailed design preparation,\nbidding processes, project management, construction supervision, preparing and supervising\nthe PBM program, road safety improvement, and heavy vehicle control.\n65. The Project is designed in accordance with the priorities of the 2001 CSP update to\nreduce poverty through economic growth, improve access to education and health services,\nprotect  disadvantaged  groups,  promote  community  participation,  support  private  sector\ndevelopment,  protect  the  environment,  and  promote  regional  cooperation.  The  roads  were\nselected from 21 candidate roads based on economic analysis and economic internal rate of\nreturn, and further studied in terms of project focus, urgency, social benefits, and environmental\nsensitivity. A summary of the design approach and technical standards for resurfacing EWH,\nand road improvement and construction components is attached as Appendix 7.\na.  East-West Highway Strengthening Component\n66. The Project will finance pavement strengthening on about 140 km of the EWH,22 from\nBelbari to Chuharwa.  The EWH section was selected considering its role as the backbone of\nthe national road network and as the main access to India. As part of the Asian Highway (AH2),\nthe improved EWH and cross-border access road will support subregional cooperation efforts.\nb.  Roads Improvement Component\n67. The Project will improve approximately 165 km of feeder roads and important district\nroads in the hill and terai regions to all-weather paved surface. The investment will cover (i)\nDolalghat-Chautara, 25 km; (ii) Biratnagar-Bardanga, 39 km; (iii) Urlabari-Bardanga, 28 km; (iv)\nDamak-Gauriganj, 22 km; (v) Pouwa Bhanjyang-Phidim, 24 km;23 and (vi) Hile-Basantpur, 26\nkm.24\nc.  Feeder-Road Construction Component\n68. The  Project  includes  the  construction  of  about  96  km  of  feeder  road  to  connect\nBasantpur to Khandbari, a district headquarters.25 This will be the first intervention road to\nSankhuwasabha district headquarters now not connected to the road network. The section will\n                  \n22The last rehabilitation and resurfacing of the section were completed in 1994 under Loan 806-NEP (footnote 11) for\na 10-year life.\n23Pouwa Bhanjyang-Phidim is an incomplete link owing to shortage of funds under the TRIP.\n24 Cofinancing by DFID has been confirmed to finance this road section.\n25 Cofinancing by DFID has been confirmed to finance this component.", "16\nbe  implemented  using  labor-oriented  construction  methods  geared  to  maximizing  local\nparticipation  and  addressing  the  objective  of  poverty  reduction  complementarily  with  other\nefforts supported by DFID. The works include improvement of 14 km of earthen road from\nKhandbari completed by GTZ and about 40 km track from Basantpur carried out by DOR, and\nconstruction of the 42 km missing link in between to all-weather gravel road.\nd.  Performance-Based Maintenance Component\n69. The Project will develop a three-year road maintenance program and provide financing\nfor first-year for about 200-300 km of road through PBM contracts26 tendered to domestic\nprivate contractors. Roads to be maintained will be selected from the ARMP. Among the ranked\nroads, the PBM component will be targeted in districts with poverty rates equal to or above the\nnational average. Support will be restricted to routine, recurrent, and periodic maintenance.\nRoad widening and improvement will be excluded. The concept of PBM and criteria for selecting\nsubprojects are outlined in Appendix 8. Consulting services will be provided to develop the\nprogram, train DOR officials and local contractors, assist with contract award, and supervise the\nworks in the first year of implementation. During the second and third years of implementation,\nthe Government will finance the payment to the contractors from the Nepal road fund, and DOR\nwill supervise and monitor the works. During this period, the consultant will monitor and evaluate\nimplementation annually, and prepare a final report including its findings, lessons learned, and\nrecommendations for replication.\n70. The PBM component will be implemented in four contracts, each over three years,\nincluding three major maintenance components: preventive work, catch-up routine work, and\nperformance (routine and recurrent work). Preventive maintenance is designed to improve the\nroads' structural condition. Catch-up routine maintenance is designed to reduce the present\nmaintenance backlog, particularly for shoulders and drainage. Some minor improvements may\nbe included such as additional drainage structures, slope protection, guardrails, road signs,\nmarkings,  and  reconstruction  of  short  sections.  After  preventive  and  catch-up  routine\nmaintenance is completed, performance maintenance will begin.\n71. The preventive and catch-up routine maintenance works will be executed and paid for\nbased on the quantity of work completed. The performance maintenance, however, will be\nexecuted according to minimum standards set in the contract. If contractors fail to maintain the\nstandard,  the  monthly  lump  sum  payment  will  be  reduced,  according  to  the  penalties  for\nnoncompliance delineated in the contract.\ne.  Cross-Border Access Road Improvement Component \n72. Considering  possible  ADB  commitment  to  subregional  transport  improvement,  the\nProject will allocate adequate funds to improve an access road of about 10 km to the border\ncrossing  at  Kakarbhitta.27  The  access  road  will  have  sufficient  width  and  strength  to\naccommodate fully loaded trucks, and widen as it approaches the checkpoint to create a waiting\narea large enough to handle the normal weekly peak traffic. As appropriate, it will be equipped\nwith a weigh station for checking the axle-load of trucks entering Nepal.\n                  \n26A PBM contract is an agreement between a government department or state enterprise and a private contractor\nwhereby the private contractor maintains the road to achieve specified condition standards for a certain period of\ntime in return for a fixed payment stream. The private sector maintains an existing road on the basis of customer-\nbased performance indicators, such as riding and strength quality, safety features, and aesthetics of the roadside.\n27This component is subject to findings of the ongoing TA 5936-REG: Identification and Prioritization of Subregional\nProjects in South Asia and the following TA on Subregional Roads Connections programmed for 2003.", "17\nf.  Road Safety and Axle-Load Control Component\n73. The Project will undertake road safety civil works at selected accident-prone areas or\nblack spots and axle-load measurement along the project roads and selected cross-border\nlocations. Improving road safety will be undertaken in accordance with ADB's Road Safety\nGuidelines. Training and public awareness on road safety improvement will be provided. Road\ndesigns will be improved by (i) improving delineation and edge marking on hill roads including\nuse of reflecting marker posts; (ii) installing deviation (chevron) boards in critical locations; (iii)\nwidening the pavement sections of main roads with high volumes of pedestrians, cycles, and\nanimal-drawn vehicles; (iv) providing off-road facilities for pedestrians in settlements, including\nfacilities for buses and bus passengers; and (v) providing adequate reflective warning signs,\nsetting realistic speed limits, and building speed bumps on roads through settlements. A safety\naudit will be conducted after the design phase prior to procurement to comply with safety\nrequirements.  An  information  campaign  on  heavy  vehicle  management  will  be  made  for\nenforcement agencies as well as truck and bus owners, drivers, and associations. The Project\nwill procure 10 sets of portable weigh-bridges, for which locations and technical specification will\nbe determined during the detailed design phase, subject to ADB review and approval.\ng.  Poverty Intervention Component\n74. The primary objective of this component is to reduce poverty by (i) physical interventions\nto improve rural accessibility for the poor and those socially excluded by constructing tracks,\ntrails,  footpaths,  pedestrian  bridges,  slope  protection,  bus  station/stops,  and  markets  at\ncommunity-selected locations to meet their domestic, economic, and social needs; and (ii)\nsocial development interventions to ensure that the poorest and socially excluded can benefit\nfrom the longer-term socioeconomic opportunities the road may bring. This would include (i)\ncommunity-based construction of facilities to improve community access, (ii) formation of a\nrevolving fund and capacity building and training for community groups on how to use the\nincome and invest in income generating activities, and (iii) enhancement and development of\nprotective interventions.28\n75. The social development intervention will be financed and implemented in parallel by\nDFID along two road sections, Hile-Basantpur and Basantpur-Khandbari roads, aside from its\ncofinancing program under the Project. A separate poverty intervention for the other project\nareas is being proposed for Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction financing on a grant basis.\n76. The poverty impact component will be targeted to the rural poor and disadvantaged\ngroups,  including  ethnic  minority  groups.  Appendix  9  provides  a  summary  of  the  poverty\nintervention and ethnic minority development plan.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n77. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $69.5 million equivalent (Table 1). Foreign\nexchange costs are estimated at $45.2 million representing 65 percent of the total project cost.\nThe local currency cost is estimated at $24.3 million equivalent representing 35 percent of the\ntotal cost.

Financing Plan\n78. The financing plan is presented in Table 2. DFID will provide a grant of \u00a37.064 million\nequivalent (about $9.6 million), or 13.8 percent of total project cost, to finance a portion of civil\nworks  construction  (feeder-road  construction  component  and  Hile-Basantpur  of  the  road\nimprovement component, which are not financed by ADB). This grant will be administered by\nADB. The proposed ADB loan is $46.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources to\nfinance 84.1 percent of the foreign exchange costs and 32.9 percent of the local currency costs;\n66.6 percent of the total project cost.

Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Executing and Implementing Agencies\n79. MPPW will be the Executing Agency, and DOR will be the Implementing Agency. Both\nMPPW and DOR have substantial experience with implementing ADB-financed road projects. A\nproject directorate, which was established and fully functional under previous projects, will be\nmaintained within DOR for overall project coordination, monitoring, and implementation. DOR\nwill maintain the appointed full-time project director, and promptly inform ADB of any change of\nthe project director. DOR will ensure that the person appointed will (i) be a senior officer with\nadequate technical and administration experience and qualifications acceptable to ADB; and (ii)\nassisted by appropriate and adequate technical and administrative staff. The Government will\nexert  its  best  endeavors  to  ensure  that,  subject  to  satisfactory  performance,  the  initially\nappointed director will be maintained in the position for a minimum of two years, during project\nimplementation.\n80. DOR  has  appointed  four  full-time  project  managers,  based  in  Chautara,  Dharan,\nBasantpur, and Damak, to be responsible for day-to-day implementation, and report to the\nproject director.\n81. The  project  director  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  PBM,  including  subproject\nselection under the ARMP, procurement, monitoring, and reporting; and will act as project\ncoordinator for this component. However, contract administration and other aspects of day-to-\nday implementation will be delegated to DOR's maintenance divisions. The project director will\ncoordinate with the road board to select subprojects and arrange payment for the second and\nthird years of implementation.\n82. The project director will also coordinate with DFID, for feeder-road construction and the\nProject's detailed design and supervision consultants will coordinate with DFID's consultants.\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n83. The Project will be implemented over five years, inclusive of preconstruction activities.\nThe Project is expected to be completed by June 2007. The civil works will be implemented in\ntwo phases, commencing around June 2003. This schedule is subject to a number of events\noccurring,  including  (i)  advance  action  being  undertaken,  and  (ii)  DOR  appointing  the", "20\nsupervision consultant by March 2002. A summary implementation schedule is attached as\nAppendix 11.\n3.  Procurement\n84. The project director will be responsible for all procurement activities. The civil works\ncontracts will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding and local competitive\nbidding procedures, for about 6 and 24 contract packages respectively, as indicated in Appendix\n12. Civil works packages with contract values more than $1.0 million will be contracted through\ninternational competitive bidding.\n85. All contracts will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nADB's  standard  bidding  documents  for  international  competitive  bidding  will  be  used.\nProcurement for local competitive bidding will be in accordance with procedures acceptable to\nADB.\n86. For the Basantpur-Khandbari works, construction methods will be in accordance with the\nconstruction  procedures  being  developed  by  DFID.  Wherever  possible  the  works  will  be\nundertaken  by  road  building  groups  (which  will  be  formed  and  trained  under  the  poverty\nintervention  component)  and  implemented  through  village  consultative  forums.  Where\nconstruction  equipment  and  imported  materials  are  required  to  achieve  specified  quality\nstandards, the works may be contracted to local contractors. Standard bidding documents for\ncommunity-based organizations, prepared under the ongoing TA (footnote 17), could be used if\nacceptable to ADB.\n87. Black spots improvement, to reduce traffic accidents, will be implemented as part of the\nrelated road contract packages. Axle-load measurement equipment will be procured under\ninternational shopping procedures. International shopping will be accepted for supply contracts\nvalued at less than $500,000, and direct purchase will be applied for small or off-the-shelf items\nvalued at less than $100,000.\n4.  Consulting Services\n88. Consulting  services  will  be  required  for  the  (i)  detailed  design  and  construction\nsupervision for the civil works under the east-west highway strengthening, roads improvement,\nfeeder-road construction, cross-border access road improvement and road safety and axle-load\ncontrol; (ii) program design and implementation supervision for PBM; and (iii) poverty reduction\nimpact  monitoring.  The  consultants  will  also  be  responsible  for  ensuring  community\nparticipation, identifying community needs, and monitoring gender and child labor issues. About\n170 person-months of international and 1,700 person-months of domestic consultants will be\nrequired. Outline terms of reference for these services are in Appendix 13.\n89. All  consultants  will  be  selected  and  appointed  by  DOR  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the\nengagement of domestic consultants. ADB has approved advance action for recruitment of\nconsultants.\n5.  Disbursement\n90. An  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in\naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook as amended from time to time, and", "21\ndetailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in\nthe imprest account will be based on the estimated expenditures for six months. The account\nwill be established with Nepal Rastra Bank. To expedite disbursement during implementation,\nstatement of expenditures will be used for contracts less than $100,000. A separate imprest\naccount will be established for DFID-financed components.\n6.  Reports, Accounts, and Audits\na.  Reports\n91. The supervision consultant will submit monthly progress reports to DOR, MPPW, and\nADB. DOR will ensure that the consultant includes in the reports the status of land acquisition,\nresettlement, environmental management, training, public campaign, and other activities that\nare  critical  to  project  implementation,  but  are  not  directly  included  in  the  scope  of  the\nengineering services. Within three months of physical completion, DOR will have the project\nconsultant submit a project completion report in a format acceptable to DOR and ADB.\n92. DOR  will  monitor  project  preparation  and  implementation  in  accordance  with  the\nimplementation schedule, and keep ADB informed of any significant deviations that could result\nin the schedule not being met.\nb.  Accounts and Audits\n93. DOR will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and\nservices financed from the loan proceeds, the financing resources received, the expenditures\nincurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. The accounts for all project expenditures will\nbe set up in accordance with consistent and sound accounting principles. Consolidated project\naccounts and related financial statements will be audited annually by independent auditors\nacceptable to ADB. The audited accounts and financial statements will be submitted to ADB not\nlater than nine months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n7.  Midterm Review\n94. In addition to regular reviews by ADB staff, the Project will require a detailed midterm\nreview by the Government, ADB, and any cofinancier to consider progress on the Project and\nagree  upon  any  changes  to  scope  or  implementation  arrangements  needed  to  safeguard\nachievement of the project objectives. The midterm review will be conducted before the second\nphase of procurement.\n8.  Project Performance Monitoring\n95. DOR, assisted by the supervision consultant, will develop a baseline for performance\nmonitoring in accordance with ADB's Project Performance Management System Handbook, and\nestablish  systematic  project  performance  monitoring  including  benefits  monitoring  and\nevaluation. The survey will be conducted prior to construction, and three months, one year, and\nfour years after completion of construction. The field information to be collected will include (i)\nroad condition and road roughness; (ii) traffic volume; (iii) road freight rates and passenger\nfares;  (iii)  prices  in  local  markets  for  agricultural  produce,  agricultural  inputs,  and  basic\nhousehold goods; and (iv) any other information, including socioeconomic indicators and key\nindicators and assumptions outlined at output and development objective levels in the project", "22\nframework (Appendix 1). The outline project performance management system is in Appendix\n14.\nF.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n96. The Project is classified as environmental category A because one of the project roads,\nBasantpur-Khandbari,29 will be built as a new alignment. The other project roadworks will be\nlimited to maintenance and improvement of existing roads, and will include minimum widening\nor changes of alignment, and therefore have minimal adverse impacts on the environment. The\neffect  on  forest  and  wildlife  of  east-west  highway  strengthening  and  road  improvement\ncomponents is considered minimal since the roads do not pass through any forest reserves and\nnational parks.\n97. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was prepared, drawing on the EIA for the\nBasantpur-Khandbari road and initial environmental examination for other road sections. The\nsummary EIA was circulated to ADB's Board of Directors on 8 August 2001. The overall\nconclusion of the EIA is that the adverse environmental impacts arising from the construction\nand operation of the project facilities can be mitigated by implementing a set of mitigation\nmeasures. Costs for environmental mitigation measures will be included in the project cost\nestimates, and such funds will be provided on a timely basis to ensure that environmental\nimpacts will be minimized to acceptable levels and will meet Government as well as ADB\nenvironmental requirements. The Government's procedure includes presentation of EIA findings\nfollowed by a public hearing to solicit comments and inputs at the affected areas prior to\nclearance of the document by the Ministry of Population and Environment. This Government\nclearance will be made as a condition of Board consideration.\n98. Although the official right-of-way of the Basantpur-Khandbari road is 30 m, DOR will\nrestrict the work within a basic construction width of 6.5 m. The road passes through several\nfragments of forestland totaling 14.8 km in length, and occupying 14.9 hectares (ha). The first\n9.0  km  of  the  road  will  pass  through  a  potential  community  conservation  area  containing\nendemic  Rhododendron  plant  species,30  i.e.,  Tinjure-Milkedanda-Jaljale  area.  While  the\nboundaries of the area have not been determined, the gross area, which will act as a reservoir\nand buffer area is about 160-200 square km and encompasses 20 villages. The areas through\nwhich the road passes are below 2,500 m altitude, within the agricultural limits, and hence, have\nbeen highly disturbed by human interference. No pristine forest areas remain along the road. In\nmany cases, the forest has been replaced with low shrubs, which may have little value to be\nincluded in the Tinjure-Milkedanda-Jaljale conservation area.\n99. Some forests covering about 10,000 ha, in the proposed conservation area, have been\nhanded over to about 32 community forest user groups. The World Conservation Union has\nbeen providing support to strengthen the community forest user groups, including development\nof (i) sustainable uses of the forest and natural resources, (ii) more efficient wood stoves and\nalternative sources of fuel, and (iii) ecotourism as a sustainable economic use of the forest.\nThus, the community has some degree of awareness to conserve the area, and therefore may\nnot allow additional exploitation of the rhododendron and other forest species for fuelwood.\nConsultation meetings with NGOs were undertaken on the proposed Project\u2019s environmental\n                  \n29 The section was one of the proposed World Bank-financed Arun III Hydropower access roads, canceled in 1989.\n30 An area located more than 1,700 m above sea level is considered a good potential for the conservation of the\nendemic Rhododendron species.", "23\nand  social  impacts,  including  the  impacts  on  the  proposed  Tinjure-Milkedanda-Jaljale\nconservation area. The NGOs support the need for the Project and are not opposed to any\nproject components.\n2.  Social\n100. In accordance with the ADB guidelines, a resettlement plan was prepared for the entire\nproject. Meetings and hearings with NGOs were held; no opposition was raised against the\nProject. The resettlement plan, which is acceptable to ADB and the Government, is summarized\nin Appendix 15.\n101. Most  of  the  land  required  for  the  Basantpur-Khandbari  road  was  acquired  by  the\nGovernment more than 10 years ago, for the Arun III access road. The overall Project is\nexpected  to  affect  329  households.  The  Project  may  require  relocation  of  a  total  of  37\nhouseholds with houses/shops and take approximately 3.0 ha of land. In addition, some 200\nfarmers may be affected by loss of crops along the Basantpur-Khandbari road; 92 farmers will\nrequire compensation for land. The estimated cost for compensation including implementation\nand monitoring is less than $500,000.\n102. During project implementation, the detailed design will be finalized and the exact number\nof households that will be affected within the 6.5 m corridor of impact of each road will be\nidentified. A detailed inventory of losses and a socioeconomic survey will be conducted of actual\naffected persons, and the resettlement plan will be updated.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic Analysis\n103. The economic analysis presented in Appendix 16 was prepared in accordance with\nADB's  Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.  The  highway  and  design  and\nmaintenance model, adjusted for conditions in Nepal, is used to calculate vehicle operating cost\nsavings. The main inputs to this are vehicle operating cost parameters, and construction and\nmaintenance costs. The feeder-road construction component, the construction of the Basantpur-\nKhandbari road, required a different approach to estimate benefits to be derived from providing\nthe new road link. The two major benefits defined were the incremental benefits resulting from\nincreased agricultural production and transport user cost savings including passenger time.\n104. Each of the project roads and the Project as a whole were evaluated up to and including\n2025,  providing  benefit  periods  of  19.5  to  20.5  years  depending  on  the  timing  of  the\nimplementation of each road. A residual value is applied in 2025, except for the overlay works\non the EWH.  For upgrading works and new construction, a residual value of 50 percent of the\nconstruction cost has been applied. This is a higher value than is usually used for road projects,\nbut is considered appropriate because of the extensive earth and other works involved that will\nhave a substantial economic value beyond the end of the evaluation period. To not include\nresidual values would bias the results against such projects but the impact on results is small.\nThe economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) would be reduced by about 1 percent if residual\nvalues in the more usual range of 20-25 percent are used.\n105. For existing roads, base-year traffic estimates use traffic counts, while traffic for the new\nconstruction component is estimated as the equivalent number of vehicles required to transport", "24\nthe goods and people currently being carried by porters or moving by foot. For the existing\nroads, traffic growth rates are based on an analysis of gross domestic product and the income\nelasticity of transport demand for freight traffic. These rates range from 7.1 percent per annum\nin the near term to 4.7 percent in the later years of the evaluation. For the new construction, a\ntraffic growth rate of 4 percent is assumed over the evaluation period. In 1999, traffic on the\nEWH averaged 1,170 vpd, and for the existing feeder roads ranged from 50 to 156 vpd. Traffic\nthat would use the Basantpur-Khandbari road after construction is estimated at 119 vpd. No\ngenerated traffic is assumed for the EWH, but for the existing feeder roads is estimated at 30\npercent for cars and utility vehicles and 15 percent for buses. Diverted traffic is not estimated,\nas none of the roads would attract traffic from another road or mode of transport.\n106. In the case of the Pouwa Bhanjyang road,31 however, traffic generation is assumed once\nthe road is improved. The assumption is based on traffic counts carried out on the contiguous\nimproved section of the Ilam-Phidim road in March 2001,32 which provide a plausible result of\nabout three times traffic volume higher than expected. Much of the increase on the road was in\nthe form of shared taxi services, which did not operate before the road was sealed. Bus\nfrequency also increased as did truck traffic.\n107. The Pouwa Bhanjyang-Phidim road is in Panchtar district. It is a tea, potato, and milk-\nproducing area, but the very bad condition of the road constrains transport of the produce out of\nthe area. Experience shows that agriculture development may result from road development\nwithout much additional assistance. Improved roads will allow vehicles to carry agriculture and\nfarming goods and will encourage more production. Therefore to better reflect the potential\ntraffic increase in the area, an updated economic analysis was done for the Pouwa Bhanjyang-\nPhidim road, assuming a 125 percent increase in traffic after completion.\n108. Road standards are appropriate for the traffic and are considered to be cost-effective.\nThe EWH will be overlayed over a 140 km length at a typical width of 10.5 m including paved\nshoulder. The feeder roads in hill areas will have a 4.5 m carriageway width including paved\nshoulders,  while  the  terai  feeder  roads  will  have  a  7.5  m  width  including  a  4.0  m  paved\ncarriageway. In the case of the upgrading of hill roads where EIRRs are low, a lower-cost gravel\nstandard was considered. Because the terrain and climate conditions of the hill areas make\nmaintenance of gravel roads difficult, the alternative option tested was a gravel road with sealing\nof steep grade sections.  These produce lower EIRRs than the all-sealed standard because the\nlower road user savings and higher maintenance costs reduce benefits more than the cost\nsavings. Costs are based on preliminary engineering and unit costs typical of the location of the\nroad. Financial costs are converted to economic costs using a standard conversion factor of\n0.88.\n109. EIRRs for each component of the Project are given in Table 3. All of the roads are\nfeasible for the recommended improvement based on quantified benefits.\n110. The results of the sensitivity tests vary. For the road improvement component, a 1-year\ndelay in obtaining benefits as a result of delayed completion reduces the viability of the roads. A\nslightly larger impact occurs with either a 20 percent increase in construction costs or a 20\npercent reduction in benefits. Excluding passenger time-savings has a higher negative impact\non viability. The EIRRs for all the other hill road projects fall to close to 12 percent or less.\n                  \n31Pouwa-Bhanjyang (24 km) road is the last section of Ilam-Phidim road, canceled from the previous ADB-TRIP\nbecause of a shortage of funds.\n32DOR. 2001. Third Road Improvement Project, Project Completion Report. Kathmandu.", "25\nReducing traffic growth by 50 percent causes major reductions in benefit levels in the later years\nof the evaluation period, but the impact on EIRRs is generally only a little larger than that of the\nother tests.  However in the case of the roads with the lowest rates of return, this impact is very\nsignificant.  The switching values for the overall Project are 165 percent higher for costs and 86\npercent lower for benefits.\nTable 3: EIRRs for Subprojects\nSubproject EIRR (%)\nBelbari-Chuharwa (140 km) 33.0\nBiratnagar-Bardanga (39 km) 19.2\nUrlabari-Bardanga (28 km) 25.1\nDamak-Gauriganj (22 km) 27.2\nDolalghat-Chautara(25 km) 13.1\nHile-Basantpur (26 km) 16.3\nPouwa Bhanjyang-Phidim (24 km) 12.1\nBasantpur-Khandbari (96 km) 14.7\nSource: TA 2969-NEP: Fourth Road Improvement Project, and\nconsultant and staff estimates.\n111. For the Basantpur-Khandbari road, increasing costs, reducing producer surplus, and\ndecreasing benefits by 20 percent each cause the EIRR to decrease to close to 12 percent. The\nswitching values for this road are a 26 percent increase in costs and 21 percent decrease in\nbenefits.\nB.  Environment\n112. In the hill areas, improvement of roadside and crossroad drainage, included as part of\nthe road works, will have a positive effect on managing storm-water flow and stabilizing slopes\ndisturbed by the initial construction. The Project will include extensive off-road bioengineering\nworks  aimed  at  revegetating  and  stabilizing  slopes  disturbed  by  construction.  New  road\nconstruction, for the Basantpur-Khandbari road, will be implemented using environment-friendly\nmethods, with maximal manual earthworks, and sufficient phased development to minimize\ndisturbance to areas that are unstable and prone to slides.\nC.  Social Dimensions\n1.  Social Impact\n113. The  social  dimensions  of  the  Project  (the  poverty  intervention  and  ethnic  minority\ndevelopment plan, the resettlement plan, contract specifications for protecting children from\nconstruction labor, and stakeholder participation and consultation) are all designed to facilitate\nmore equitable and sustainable distribution of benefits particularly for the poorest and socially\nexcluded in the project areas.\n114. The Project recognizes that direct harm as well as indirect adverse social impacts may\nresult from the development. These potential adverse impacts will be mitigated by the Project\nthrough  complementary  activities  including  (i)  participatory  development  and  effective\nimplementation of a resettlement plan for compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation of\npeople affected by land acquisition for the Project; (ii) awareness raising of alternative work\nopportunities;  (iii)  awareness  raising  of  social  damage  resulting  from  undesirable  social", "26\npractices, and (iv) awareness raising about migrant labor and prioritizing the use of local labor in\nroad building groups. The resettlement plan will be implemented in conjunction with the poverty\nintervention component.\n115. No  specific  ethnic  or  caste  groups  will  be  especially  adversely  affected.  Many\nindigenous, tribal, and caste groups live within the project area, particularly in the hill areas, but\nthey will not be disadvantaged or vulnerable because of their social or cultural identity. In fact,\nthe poverty intervention component is targeted specifically at all poor and socially excluded\ncommunities and groups, regardless of ethnicity or caste living in the vicinity of the project\nroads. Particular attention will be given to special needs along project roads to be identified\nthrough participatory stakeholder analysis.\n2.  Beneficiaries\n116. The Project will benefit communities within the project corridor as well as communities in\nthe hinterlands that will have improved access to the project roads. Improvement of the EWH\nwill benefit private traders and other industries along the influenced corridors that will be able to\nexpand due to more efficient road transport, and the people who will obtain increased incomes\nand employment opportunities, including the poor. The beneficiaries of improved feeder and\ndistrict roads will be the farmers and other affected communities, where poverty incidence is\nhigher than the national level. Production and quality of life are expected to increase due to\nmore accessible roads.\n117. Population in the zone of influence of the roads will enjoy faster and lower-cost bus\ntransport. Presently, bus fares on highways generally average less than NRs1.0 per km, while\non poor condition feeder roads the fare can exceed NRs3.0 per km. Improved access and\nincreased competition should result in lower fares and more frequent travel by the population.\n118. The use of competitive tendering process will provide opportunities for local consulting\nand construction firms to participate in implementation. Furthermore, the PBM contracts should\nalso help to strengthen the private sector by creating more jobs and providing continuous\ncontracts for maintenance. The road maintenance component, together with the road safety\ncomponent will benefit road users and pedestrians throughout the country.\nD.  Impact on Poverty\n119. The economic impacts of the Project include: reduced vehicle operating costs, increased\naccess  to  markets,  lower  prices,  better  marketing  opportunities,  and  more  employment\nopportunities including construction and maintenance of project roads, all leading to a higher\nGDP growth rate.  Without the basic road infrastructure, health, markets, and educational\nservices, which are presently inaccessible in much of the project area, will be difficult to access.\nWhile most direct benefits are in the form of reduced transport costs, the profits of farmers and\nsaving by consumers will be more equally shared among the poor. The summary poverty\nassessment is attached as Appendix 17.\n120. In 2000, approximately 1.1 million people were living in the project area, of which around\n41.2 percent were poor. The Project is expected to directly benefit about 745,932 people (70\npercent of the total population), of whom 351,835 (47.2 percent) are poor, by improving access\nto valued goods and services. The Project will also indirectly benefit about 319,685 people (30\npercent of total), of whom 150,787 are poor. The Project will have a positive poverty reduction", "27\nimpact on the poor in the project area by generating income opportunities because of road and\naccess construction and related livelihood improvements.\n121. The Project has the potential to generate job opportunities for approximately 1,000\nunskilled  laborers  and  500  skilled  laborers  to  supplement  their  earnings  through  road\nconstruction along the roads to be improved. In addition, approximately 2,000 unskilled laborers\nwill be needed for the labor-based construction of the Hile-Basantpur and Basantpur-Khandbari\nroads.\n122. The Project will support pro-poor economic growth by improving transport efficiency that\nwill  support  domestic  trade  and  cross-border  transport,  which  will  generate  increases  in\nemployment including for the poor. This will also be a poverty intervention project, since the\nproportion of the poor among the project beneficiaries is larger than their proportion in the\noverall population of the country. The PBM financed under the Project will be targeted to\ndistricts with a high incidence of poverty. The poverty intervention component of the Project,\ncomplemented by DFID's rural access program will enhance the Project\u2019s poverty reduction\nefforts.\n123. The benefit distribution analysis was carried out and poverty reduction impact ratio was\ncalculated for representative roads of the Project. The results suggest that 40 percent of the\nusers of the project roads are poor. About 75 percent of bus users are poor, and 20 percent of\nother vehicle users are poor. The poverty impact ratio of the hill roads is more than 100 percent,\n55 percent for the terai roads, and 33 percent for the EWH, indicating the percentage of the net\nproject benefits reaching poor users.\nE.  Risks\n124. The  Project  has  been  carefully  formulated  to  positively  manage  and  mitigate  risks.\nAdvance action will help expedite consultant recruitment for detailed design and construction\nsupervision. The project management unit, including four project managers, was established\nprior to loan negotiations. The risk of inadequate counterpart funding has been addressed by\ngaining Government commitment to include the Project in its core projects starting in FY2001/02\nto  ensure  that  the  budget  allocations  for  the  Project  will  be  protected.  Furthermore,  the\nGovernment has provided an adequate allocation for the Project in its FY2001/02 budget, which\nreflects the Government's commitment to ensuring adequate local counterpart funds for the\nProject.\n125. General risks for project implementation arise from the high uncertainty in the political\nsituation  and  adverse  macroeconomic  conditions.  Complementary  interventions  have  been\nformulated to ensure that local communities will gain the project benefits. A specific geographic\ncondition of Nepal as a landlocked country with landslide-prone areas also needs to be taken\ninto account. All those problems may delay the implementation and affect the actual costs of the\nimplementation  resulting  in  reduction  of  the  project  scope.  Therefore,  a  sufficient\nimplementation period and contingencies have been provided under the Project to mitigate the\nrisks.\n126.   The remaining risks arise from the use of local contractors to carry out most of the civil\nworks. Concerns about their limited managerial, financial, and equipment resources have been\nsuccessfully addressed under the TRIP. The Project will continue the approaches of (i) carefully\nselecting contractors based upon their resources and experience with road construction; (ii)\nproviding substantial assistance to contractors by having the project consultant impart practical", "28\nday-to-day  management  and  technical  advice;  (iii)  procuring  the  works  in  relatively  small\npackages and in two stages, so that the failure of one contractor will not have a major impact on\nthe remainder of the Project; and (iv) ensuring the Government's commitment to promote a\nviable and efficient private sector contracting industry for road construction, improvement, and\nmaintenance works.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n127. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nprovisions which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  the\nresettlement plan agreed to by the Borrower and ADB is implemented by DOR\nunder arrangements satisfactory to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on\nInvoluntary Resettlement and ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement, as amended\nfrom time to time. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement will be borne by\nthe Borrower.\n(ii)  Environmental Management. The Government will ensure that all environmental\nmitigation measures identified in the EIA are incorporated in the project design\nand  followed  during  project  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance,  in\nconsultation with the Ministry of Population and Environment and in accordance\nwith ADB's environmental guidelines and the environmental management plan\nagreed to with ADB. Monitoring will be carried out in accordance with the project\nperformance monitoring system (Appendix 14) and will be reported by DOR to\nADB through the progress reports on project implementation, and an evaluation\nreport one year after completion of construction.\n(iii)  Operation  and  Maintenance.  DOR  will  be  responsible  for  the  operation  and\nmaintenance  of  the  project  roads  through  proper  technical  supervision  and\nadequate allocation of funds. Loan proceeds set aside under the Project for\nroutine and recurrent maintenance on selected subprojects for the SRN will be\napplied  through  the  first  year  of  the  PBM  component,  to  be  selected  in\naccordance with the ARMP. DOR will continue to supervise the implementation\nof PBM and financing through the proposed road fund.\n(iv)  Health Risks. The Government will ensure that the civil works contracts reflect\nthe  need  for  an  information  and  education  campaign  by  the  contractor  on\nsexually  transmitted  diseases  and  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome for construction workers as part of the health and\nsafety program at campsites during the construction period.\n(v)  Counterpart  Funds.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  timely  and  adequate\nprovision of counterpart funds for the Project.\n(vi)  Axle-Load Control. The Government will establish and implement a pragmatic\nand enforceable heavy vehicle management policy, acceptable to all concerned\nagencies such as MPPW, DOR, MPPW's Legal Section, and DOTM, as well as\ntransport service organizations and Nepal Traffic Police by the end of 2002. The", "29\nGovernment  will  amend  the  Vehicle  and  Transport  Management  Act  to\nincorporate an appropriate penalty structure sufficient to act as a deterrent to\npotential violators. Sufficient enforcement staff will be recruited and necessary\nequipment for the heavy vehicle control will be procured. DOR will set up axle-\nload control stations at appropriate locations, and will provide regular reports\n(quarterly) to ADB on the status of load enforcement measures, incidence of\nvehicle overloading, and other benchmarks that are consistent with the policy.\n(vii)  Labor Laws. The Government will ensure that the civil works contractors comply\nwith all applicable labor laws, do not employ child labor for construction and\nmaintenance  activities,  and  provide  appropriate  facilities  for  children  in\nconstruction campsites. The Government will set employment targets for women\nfor road construction activities, as well as require contractors not to differentiate\nwages between men and women for work of equal value. A specific clause will\nbe included in bidding documents, and compliance will be strictly monitored\nduring project implementation.\n(viii)  Financial Administration Regulations. The Government will approve the Public\nWorks Directives prepared under TA 3306-NEP (footnote 17) as appropriate to\nthe Government, and amend the regulations accordingly.\nB.  Conditions for Award of Contracts\n128. The Government will not award any civil works contract until after acquiring or making\navailable, the land and rights of land, free of encumbrances, required to execute the contract.\n129. For the PBM component, the Government will not award any contract until after (i) the\nRoad Board Bill is tabled in Parliament, and (ii) the roads selected for maintenance have met\nthe selection criteria set out in Appendix 8, and ADB concurrence obtained.\nVII.

General\n1.  The Project will comprise\n(i)  resurfacing of the East-West Highway (EWH): Belbari\u2013Chuharwa from kilometer\n78 to kilometer 218 (about 140 km);\n(ii)  improving  of:  Dolalghat\u2013Chautara  (25  km);  Biratnagar\u2013Bardanga  (39  km);\nUrlabari\u2013Bardanga  (28km);  Damak\u2013Gauriganj  (22  km);  Pouwa  Bhanjyang\u2013\nPhidim (24 km); Hile\u2013Basantpur (26 km); and\n(iii)  construction of the Basantpur\u2013Khandbari road (96 km)\n2. The  existing  Belbari\u2013Chuharwa  road  has  50-60  millimeter  (mm)  asphalt  concrete\npavement that has been cracking and is in seriously weakened condition; overlaying works are\nurgently required. The existing feeder and district roads consist of bituminous, gravel, and\nearth/rock  surfaces  and  are  in  bad  conditions;  they  need  to  be  improved  to  maintainable\nstandards of all-weather bitumen feeder roads. Some structures will also require refurbishment\nand replacement. The Basantpur\u2013Khandbari road has been opened up to tracks and earthen\nsurface for some 50 km, and will be newly constructed to feeder road tracks, earthen, and\neventually all-weather gravel standard.\n3. The Road Design Standard of the Department of Road (DOR) for National Highways\nand Feeder Roads (1997) will be used with necessary modifications, consistent with the United\nKingdom  Overseas  Road  Note  31  and  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and\nTransportation Officials (AASHTO) Design Standards.\nB. Design Standards\n4. Traffic counts were taken during the feasibility study, and projections were developed for\nthe 20-year project design period. These projections, together with terrain conditions, were used\nto  determine  physical  capacity  requirements.  These  roads  pass  through  different  kinds  of\nterrain, from nearly flat to rolling and mountainous.\n5. Design speed in the flat terrain is 60-80 km per hour (kph); this will decrease to 40-60\nkph and 20-40 kph in the rolling and mountainous terrain respectively. The carriageway widths\nvarying from 7 meters (m) for the EWH to 3.5 m for feeder and district roads with tighter width\nstandards in mountainous terrain. Provision of extra widths will be made at every km stone to\nallow some bigger vehicles to pass. On the road stretches through villages, markets, and other\ncongested areas, extra carriageway width will also be provided.\n6. The Project will be implemented generally within the existing formation width. Some\nsections of the project road will require realignments to improve road safety and capacity.\nMinimum  land  clearance,  cut  and  fill,  reduction  of  resettlement  impacts  as  well  as  cost-\neffectiveness  will  be  taken  into  account  for  realignments.  Construction  inside  the  existing\ncleared roadway width should be maximized when the road sections pass any environment-\nsensitive or mountainous areas. The requirement for additional rock cut of side slopes should be\nminimized (plant cover maintained). In areas of unstable soils side slopes should be benched as\nappropriate.", "40\nAppendix 7, page 2\n7. Pavements have been designed in accordance with international practice for a 5-10 year\nlife, with provision for overlay or regraveling during or at the end of that period to extend the life\nto 10-15 years. The designs are based on projected traffic, axle loads, existing pavement\nstructure, subgrade California Bearing Ratio (CBR), and quality of materials available. For the\nBasantpur\u2013Khandbari road, provision of higher standard of pavement will be made when the\nroads pass through mountainous terrain (gradient more than 5 percent), villages, and district\nareas.\n8. Bridges  and  drainage  structures  will  be  designed  in  accordance  with  acceptable\ninternational standards.\n9. The indicative cross sections and pavement structures for each road are shown in Table\nA7.\nTable A7: Indicative Cross Section and Pavement Structure\nFlat & Flat-Rolling Mountainous\nRoad Section\nCarriageway Shoulder Carriageway Shoulder\n(Length)\nWidth (m)/ Width (m)/ Width (m)/ Width (m)/\nType Type Type Type\nBelbari\u2013Chuharwa (140 km) 7.0 / AC 2 x 1.75 / \u2014 \u2014\nDBST\nBiratnagar\u2013Bardanga (39 km)\nUrlabari\u2013Bardanga (28 km) 3.5 / DBST 2 x 2.0 / \u2014 \u2014\nSBST\nDamak\u2013Gauriganj (22 km)\nDolalghat\u2013Chautara (25 km)\nPouwa Bhanjyang\u2013Phidim (24 km) \u2014 \u2014 3.5 / DBST 2 x 0.5 /\nSBST\nHile\u2013Basantpur (26 km)\nBasantpur\u2013Khandbari (96 km) \u2014 \u2014 4.5 / gravel \u2014\n\u2014 = not aplicable, AC = aggregate concrete, DBST = double bitumen surface treatment, SBST = single bitumen\nsurface treatment.", "41\nAppendix 8, page 1\nPERFORMANCE-BASED MAINTENANCE BY CONTRACT\nA.  Concept\n1. A performance-based maintenance (PBM) contract is an agreement between a\ngovernment department or state enterprise and a private contractor whereby the private\ncontractor maintains the road to achieve specified condition standards for a certain\nperiod of time (usually long-term, ranging from 3 to 10 years) in return for a fixed\npayment stream.\n2. The  concept  of  PBM  contracts  originated  from  a  consideration  of  (i)  the\nincreasing  lack  of  personnel  within  the  government  road  departments  available  to\nmeasure the vast quantities of activities involved in the more traditional maintenance\ncontracts,  and  to  monitor  performance  standards  using  inputs  indicators;  (ii)  the\nfrequency of claims resulting from the necessity to increase the quantities of activities of\nthe original contracts; (iii) the need to focus more on customer satisfaction; and (iv) the\nneed to shift greater responsibility to contractors throughout the entire contract period,\nas well as to stimulate and profit from their innovative capabilities.1\n3. The PBM contract is different from a traditional quantity and unit-price-based,\nshort-term maintenance contract. Under the traditional maintenance contract, the private\nsector  maintains  an  existing  road  based  on  input  indicators,  such  as  materials,\nequipment, and labor, or more frequently, tons of pothole patch material used, number of\nlinear meters of pipe culverts replaced, and number of square meters of crack sealed.\nUnder the PBM contracts, the private sector maintains an existing road on the basis of\ncustomer-based  performance  indicators,  such  as  riding  and  strength  quality\n(smoothness), safety features, and aesthetics and attractiveness of roadside.\n4. The PBM contract is also different from an operation and maintenance (O&M)\nconcession.  Under  the  PBM  contract,  performance  risks  are  allocated  between  the\ngovernment/client  and  the  contractor.  However,  the  traffic  risk  remains  with  the\ngovernment. Under the O&M concession, the concessionaire assumes the traffic and,\nultimately, the revenue risks. The concessionaire collects the toll, maintains the road,\nand pays an agreed-upon amount to the government. Since the risk from uncertain\ntraffic is to be borne by private sector, the O&M concession is only suitable for roads\nwith sufficient traffic volume. For low-volume roads, the PBM contracts may prove a\npromising alternative modality for private sector participation in the road sector.\n5. The PBM is especially suitable for low-volume roads with gravel surface or thin\nbituminous surface treatments as the continued serviceability of such roads depends\nentirely on the quality and reliability of future maintenance. It offers an effective means to\nimprove the efficiency and public accountability of road maintenance operations. Other\nbenefits include improved service to road users, reliable and secure funding for road\nmaintenance, and reduced size of the government establishment (staff, equipment, and\nbuildings) needed for road maintenance operations. In the long run, this approach could\nsignificantly reduce the unit cost of maintenance operations while improving the quality\nand cost-effectiveness of maintenance works.\n                                                          \n1 Cabana, G, Liautaud, G and Faiz, A. 1999.

The contractor is responsible for maintaining the road at performance standards\nagreed-upon in the PBM contract. These standards should be defined with the aim of\nminimizing the long-term cost of preserving the road, as well as the cost to the road\nuser. Example of performance standards are in Table A8.1.\nTable A8.1: Examples of Specification of Performance\nAsset Class Component Performance Standard\nPavement Potholes No potholes\nRoughness (asphalt) IRI<2.0 (Argentina), IRI<2.8 (Uruguay)\nRoughness (bituminous treatment) IRI<2.9 (Argentina), IRI<3.4 (Uruguay)\nRutting <12mm (Argentina), <10mm (Uruguay)\nCracks Sealed\nShoulder Potholes No potholes\nCracks Sealed\nJoints with Pavement Vertical alignment<1cm (Chile,\nUruguay), sealed (Peru)\nDrainage Obstruction No obstructions.

Vital to the success of this performance-based contract is to have appropriate\nmonitoring  procedures,  combined  with  penalties  for  noncompliance.  PBM  contracts\nshould have well-defined monitoring procedures. Inspectors may be hired to inspect the\nroad  and  make  random  checks  regularly  to  verify  compliance.  A  well-documented\ninventory of the road, as well as daily records of activities undertaken by the contractor\nwill help understand the specific characteristics of the roads and contribute to better\npreventive maintenance. Road users may also be encouraged to take an important role\nin  monitoring  performance  by  reporting  road  deficiencies  to  the  road  agency.  A\npercentage of noncompliance may be calculated based on a formula incorporated in the\ncontract, by which penalties are applied.\nC.  Bidding Processes\n8. The guiding principle for bidding processes should be to maximize competition\nand clarity in the process. The major aspects that should be considered to ensure\ncompetitive and transparent bidding processes are as follows:", "43\nAppendix 8, page 3\n(i)  Detailed development of the contract should be set out clearly in the\nbidding documents, specifying the responsibilities of the contractor and\nthe government.\n(ii)  A draft contract agreement should be prepared by the government and\nincluded in the bidding documents to ensure that all bidders make similar\nassumptions.\n(iii)  The evaluation criteria should be clearly set out in the bidding documents.\nThe most transparent approach is to select a single criterion, perhaps the\nlowest  level  of  bid  price  for  a  given  performance  specification.  The\ndecision should be made only after prequalification procedures where\npotential bidders are evaluated in terms of their technical, operational,\nand financial capacity.\nD.  Criteria for Selecting Performance-based Maintenance Subprojects\n9. The PBM component will finance a program of road maintenance of roads under\nDepartment  of  Road  (DOR)  responsibility  from  DOR's  Annual  Road  Maintenance\nProgram (ARMP). This will be divided in four contracts to be implemented over four\nyears, taking into account prior consulting services for preparing the program. Each\ncontract will cover civil works of about $1.0 million in value, providing for maintenance for\nabout 100-300 kilometers (km) of roads.\n10. Roads to be included will be subject to the approval of the Asian Development\nBank (ADB). Roads will be selected in order of estimated economic returns, based on\nthe rankings produced by the latest ARMP,2 and subject to the following criteria. For\nroads satisfying the criteria, preference will be given to roads that were previously\nimproved under ADB assistance. The criteria for selecting subprojects for inclusion in the\nPBM program are as follows:\n(i)  The roads are included in DOR's ARMP and have been identified as\npriority maintenance tasks.\n(ii)  The roads are located within geographic areas of concentration to be\nselected by DOR and approved by ADB.\n(iii)  The geographic areas of concentration will be confined to districts with\nrates of poverty equal to or above the national average, according to the\nlatest official estimates of poverty in Nepal.\n(iv)  The proposed civil works will be limited to preventive works, catch-up\nroutine  maintenance,  and  performance  maintenance.  Preventive\nmaintenance  is  designed  to  improve  the  roads'  structural  condition.\nCatch-up  routine  maintenance  is  designed  to  reduce  the  present\nmaintenance  backlog,  particularly  for  shoulders  and  drainage.  Some\nminor  improvements  may  be  included  such  as  additional  drainage\nstructures,  slope  protection,  guard  rails,  road  signs,  markings,  and\nreconstruction of short sections.

Introduction\n1. Poverty in Nepal has mostly a rural face. Poverty, and particularly social exclusion, are\nclosely linked in Nepal to caste and ethnicity. It is the highest in remote hilly and mountain\ndistricts. The hill tribes and occupational castes have the highest levels of poverty, with the\noccupational castes having the lowest average incomes. The poverty intervention will be\ntargeted to the rural poor and disadvantaged groups, mostly ethnic minority groups. Hence, an\nintegrated poverty intervention and ethnic minority development plan (PIEMDP) was prepared.\nThe plan draws particular attention to the complementarily of road improvement with the social\ndevelopment intervention by Department for International Development (DFID) under its Rural\nAccess Program (RAP) in Hile-Basantpur and Basantpur-Khandbari areas.\n2. The objective of the PIEMDP is to ensure that the Project will mitigate any adverse\nimpacts  upon  minority  groups  and  communities,  and  provide  them  with  opportunities  to\nparticipate  in  and  benefit  equally  from  the  Project's  interventions.  More  specifically,  the\nobjective is to reduce poverty by (i) ensuring the poor and socially excluded are able to take\nadvantage  of  social  and  economic  opportunities  arising  from  improved  access;  and  (ii)\nimproving rural accessibility for the poor and excluded in the project area by constructing\ntracks, trails, footpaths, pedestrian bridges, bus station/stops, and markets at community-\nselected locations to meet their domestic, economic, and social needs.\nB. Ethnic Minority Groups and Related Policy\n3. The Constitution is the fundamental law of Nepal. It declares Nepal a multiethnic,\nmultilingual,  democratic,  independent,  indivisible,  sovereign,  and  constitutional  monarchial\nkingdom. Basic human rights are granted to every citizen. Additional safeguards noted in the\nConstitution  include  the  right  to  own  property;  the  right  to  conserve  and  promote  one's\nlanguage, script, and culture; the right to be educated in one's mother tongue; freedom of\nreligion; and the right to manage and protect religious places and trusts.\n4. The  Government\u2019s  current  five-year  development  plan  values  target  group-based\nprogram interventions as the preferred method to reach groups and areas suffering from\npoverty. Targeted group programs attempt to address regional disparities, gender concerns,\nand marginalized groups by specifically identifying groups such as janajati (indigenous and\nethnic groups), dalit (people facing discrimination due to caste), kamaiya (bonded laborers),\nsukumbasi (landless in-migrants), marginalized farmers and the landless, disabled people,\nsenior citizens, women, and children.\n5. In 1999 the combined population of the project area was more than 1 million. The\nBrahmin, Chhetri, Newar groups (BCNs) dominate on the terai, with considerable populations\nof occupational castes and some migrant hill tribes. The hill tribes, with some incursions of the\nBCNs, dominate the hill areas in the east. The BCNs dominate in the Central region hill roads\nwith significant occupational caste groups as they do in the Far Western hill roads.

Development and Mitigation Activities\n6. The PIEMDP will include two types of interventions:\n(i)  Physical interventions: providing access from community centers to the nearest\nmotorable road by building or improving footpaths, pedestrian bridges, tracks,\nand bus stops; and improving community facilities such as markets.\n(ii)  Social development interventions: Protecting interventions target those likely to\nbe adversely affected, and include support to local communities to resolve\nissues such as compensation. Enabling interventions include rights awareness\nraising; training in communication, leadership, advocacy, and negotiation so\nthat rights can be exercised; and training in savings group formation. Enhancing\ninterventions provide information on income generating opportunities, promote\nestablishment of revolving funds for community groups, and link with marketing\norganizations to promote increased trade.1\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n7. The physical interventions will be identified, planned, implemented, and operated by the\ncommunity  groups  through  the  social  development  interventions.  The  implementation  of\nphysical interventions will be financed and managed under the Project. In parallel, the social\ndevelopment  interventions  for  the  Hile-Basantpur  and  Basantpur-Khandbari  roads  will  be\nmanaged and financed by DFID under its RAP. Therefore, the Executing and Implementing\nagencies,  and  the  design  and  supervision  consultants  of  the  Project  must  work  in  close\n                                                     \n1  DFID Nepal. 2000.

A separate poverty intervention program for other roads is being\nproposed under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.\n8. Social Preparation. The first year of the Project will focus on preparation of the local\ngovernment and people within the zone of influence (ZOI) to participate in and commit to the\nProject's social development component. Local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), with\nthe  use  of  social  mobilizers,  will  assist  local  communities  to  prepare  for  the  Project.\nPreparation will include formation and training of road building groups (RBGs).\n9. Identification of Physical Interventions Component. During detailed design, village\nroads, trails, and footbridges will be identified through village consultation in response to\ncommunity needs assessment.\n10.  Formation of Road Building Groups. DFID-RAP and the project consultants will\nwork with local NGOs to mobilize RBGs from surrounding communities to construct/improve\ndistrict feeder road, trails, and bridges. The Department of Roads will manage small local\ncontractors to construct the district feeder road.\n11. Implementation  of  Physical  Interventions  Component.  All  construction  will  be\ncarried out using labor-based methods.\n12. Complementary Support Programs to the RBGs. These programs will include adult\nliteracy, book-keeping, resource mobilization, savings, and credit opportunities. Each RBG\nmember  will  be  encouraged  to  deposit  10  to  20  percent  of  his/her  earnings  from  road\nconstruction in the group saving fund. The social mobilizers will also facilitate on behalf of the\nRBGs  to  identify  what  additional  activities  are  required  to  improve  the  conditions  of  the\ncommunities. Social mobilizers will facilitate rights awareness, and women's empowerment.\nThe program will also seek to help maximize the sustainable enterprise development activities\nand  opportunities  available  to  communities.  Activities  could  include  the  development  of\nfishponds, tree planting, fruit production, piggeries, etc., for communities at large.\nE. Monitoring and Evaluation\n13. Baseline surveys will be established at the start of the programs for each district to\nmeasure the impact of interventions; the changing status and circumstances of individuals,\nhouseholds, and communities; relationships between stakeholders; locally perceived changes\nin households and individual well-being; and institutional change.\n14. Local communities will be involved directly in monitoring and tracking changes in\nlivelihoods at the local level.  This will also empower the primary stakeholders (facility users,\nand  other  local  groups)  and  immediate  secondary  stakeholders  (community-based\norganizations, NGOs, and local government) to ensure transparency and contribute to good\ngovernance.\nF. Implementation Schedule\n15. The  social  development  interventions  will  be  started  in  2002  and  the  physical\ninterventions will be implemented during 2004-2006.", "48 Appendix 10\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES\n($ million)\nBase Cost/km FX LC\nItem Cost\nA.

Introduction\n1.  An initial social assessment (ISA) was carried out for the road improvement component\nof the Project. A 100 percent census and social impact assessment (SIA) of a sample of\npotentially  affected  households  was  carried  out  for  the  road  construction  component,  the\nBasantpur-Khandbari road.  The Resettlement Plan (RP) prepared based on the ISA and SIA\nwill be updated following detailed design based on a full census and inventory of losses.\nB. Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n2.  The detailed design will be developed with a view to minimizing the need for land\nacquisition and involuntary resettlement while taking into account adequate safety measures.\nMinimal  land  acquisition  will  be  necessary  for  reshaping  bends  and  reinforcing  road\nembankments. For Basantpur-Khandbari, the Project will keep all works within a corridor of\nimpact of 6.5  meters (m), which is within the 30 m right-of-way (ROW) that was acquired by the\nDepartment of Roads (DOR) in 1989 under the Arun III Hydropower Project. Most households\nwere compensated at that time, and permitted to remain within the ROW until the land would be\nrequired.\n3.  Based on the ISA, SIA and census, 329 households may be affected by land acquisition\nfor the Project, including about 3.0 hectares (ha) of land acquired, about 200 farmers with loss\nof crops, and potential resettlement of 37 houses/shops. Most of the crop land is along the\nBasantpur-Khandbari road for which compensation has already been paid for land but not for\ncrops. In addition, every attempt will be made to compensate 92 farmers who did not receive\ntheir compensation when DOR acquired the ROW for the Basantpur-Khandbari road. Table\nA15.1 shows the likely scale of impact.  This will be updated during the detailed design phase.\nTable A15.1: Likely Scale of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impact\n Road Section Land Take Potential Resettlement\n(hectares)\nPouwa Bhanjyang\u2013Phidim 0.3 None\nBiratnagar\u2013Bardanga 0.5 None\nUlarbari\u2013Bardanga None None\nDamak\u2013Gaurigunj None None\nDolalghat\u2013Chautara 0.3 5 shops/houses\nEWH: Belbari\u2013Chuharwa None None\nHile\u2013Basantpur 0.34 2 houses\nBasantpur\u2013Khandbari 1.92 200 farmers for crops/trees\n30 houses/shops\nTotal 3.06 37 house/shops\n 200 farmers losing crops\n 92 lots to be compensated\nSource:   Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW). 2001.

The policy framework and entitlements for the Project are built upon the national and\nlocal laws (i.e., Constitution of Nepal; Land Acquisition Act 2034; Public Road Act, 2031; and\nLand Reform Act, 2021), and ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Despite its limitations,\nthe main legislation to guide land acquisition in Nepal is the Land Acquisition Act 2034 (1977).\nThe Water and Energy Commission Secretariat is currently taking initiative for the Amendment\nof Land Acquisition Act 2034 with technical assistance from Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nThe RP has been prepared in accordance with the precedents set by the ongoing World Bank-\nassisted Road Maintenance and Development Project and the ADB-assisted Melamchi Water\nSupply Project. The entitlement matrix for the Project is summarized in Table A15.2.\nTable A15.2. Entitlement Matrix\nType of Loss Unit of Description of Entitlement and\nEntitlement Implementation Procedures\n1.

Resettlement Strategy\n7. Of the 329 households potentially affected, only 37 households may be affected by\ndisplacement of houses and shops for all project roads. All households prefer to make their\nown arrangements for displacement and will be assisted during the transition period. Landless\nhouseholds  or  nontitleholders  will  be  entitled  to  resettlement  and  income  restoration\nassistance if they have been occupying the affected land for at least three years prior to the\ncensus  cut-off  date  and  do  not  have  title  to  any  other  land.  The  Project  will  provide\nresettlement and rehabilitation assistance.\nTable A15.3: Estimated Relocation Requirements along Project Roads\nRoad Section Houses Shop/Houses Shops Total PAF\nDolalghat\u2013Chautara 0 5 0 5\nHile\u2013Basantpur 2 0 0 2\nBasantpur\u2013Khandbari 16 12 2 30\nTOTAL 18 17 2 37\nPAF = Project affected family\nSource: MPPW. 2001.

Income restoration measures will be provided to restore income levels of severely\naffected persons and households through social interventions under the poverty intervention\nand ethnic minority development plan component (PIEMDP, Appendix 9).\n9. Land titles will be transferred from affected households to DOR after all compensation\nand  other  entitlements  have  been  delivered.  This  will  be  effected  retroactively  for  land\nacquired within the ROW from Basantpur to Khandbari.\n5. Vulnerable Groups\n10. The  ISA  and  SIA  identified  vulnerable  groups  as  the  poor  and  socially  excluded\nincluding the many ethnic minority groups throughout the project areas. The PIEMDP was\nprepared to ensure the poor and minority groups will be able to take advantage of social and\neconomic opportunities arising from improved access provided by the Project.\n6. Consultation, Participation, and Grievance Mechanism\n11. During the 1998/99 ISA and May-June 2001 census/survey, informal meetings were\nheld with all affected village development committees and district development committees\nalong the Hile-Basantpur-Khandbari road. In addition, all households within a 10 m corridor of\nimpact were interviewed. Informal interviews and focus group discussions were also held\nalong  the  other  road  sections  during  the  feasibility  study  in  1998/99.  Further  public\nconsultation and participation will be undertaken during resettlement implementation. The\ncontents  of  the  RP  and  entitlement  matrix  will  be  disclosed  to  affected  people  and\ncommunities, prior to updating the RP. A grievance mechanism is being established for the\nProject.\n7. Institutional Arrangements\n12. A social development support team will be established within the Environment and\nSocial  Unit  of  the  project  coordination  unit  (PCU),  consisting  of  an  international  social\ndevelopment specialist (6 person-months) and counterpart domestic consultants (48 person-\nmonths).  Responsibilities  will  include  preparation,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the\nupdated  RP;  stakeholder  participation;  information  dissemination;  and  liaison  with  other\ngovernment agencies, and Department for International Development consultants.\n13. Compensation determination committees will be established in each concerned district\naccording to the provisions of the land acquisition. Representatives of affected persons will be\nincluded in committees as observers. Local consultative forums will also be established in\neach village development committee, including representation of affected persons.\n8. Monitoring\n14. The PCU will establish a monthly reporting system comprising regular reporting. The\ninternational social development consultant will assist the PCU social development support\nteam  to  undertake  internal  monitoring,  which  will  include  periodic  household  surveys  to\nevaluate the impact of resettlement on the income levels and living standards of affected\npeople against the baseline that will be established when updating the RP.", "63\nAppendix 15, page 6\n9.

Introduction\n1. The  benefit  and  cost  analysis  of  the  proposed  road  strengthening  and\nimprovement  components  were  prepared  based  on  the  Highway  Design  and\nMaintenance Model, developed primarily by the World Bank and adjusted for conditions\nin Nepal. Economic evaluation was made by comparing the with project and the without\nproject cases.\n2. The new construction of the Basantpur-Khandbari component required a different\napproach to estimating benefits to be derived from providing the new road link.1 The two\nmajor  benefits  defined  were  the  net  value  of  increased  agricultural  production  and\ntransport user cost savings. The transport cost savings, including passenger time, were\nbased on the differences between road transport costs and the cost of freight being\ncarried by porters or of passengers\u2019 time costs on trails.\n3. The project roads were evaluated up to and including 2025, providing benefit\nperiods of 19.5 to 20.5 years depending on the timing of the implementation of each\nroad. A residual value is applied in 2025, except for the overlay works on the east-west\nhighway (EWH). For upgrading works and new construction, a residual value of 50\npercent of the construction cost has been applied because of the extensive earth and\nother works involved that will have a substantial economic value beyond the end of the\nevaluation period.\nB. Traffic Growth Forecasts and Traffic Volumes\n4. Current traffic volumes on the project roads were determined from traffic counts\ncarried out in 1999 and 2001, which were normalized through the application of factors\nto convert specific counts to represent annual average daily traffic.2 For freight traffic, the\nforecast is based on an analysis of gross domestic product and the income elasticity of\ntransport demand. Passenger growth rates are based on population growth rate, per\ncapita income growth, and the income elasticity of transport demand. Table A16.1 shows\nthe traffic projections and Table A16.2 presents the traffic growth rates including the\nfactors forming those rates.  For the Basantpur-Khandbari section, a constant traffic\ngrowth rate of 4 percent per annum was used.\nTable A16.1: Traffic Growth (1999-2023)\nRoad Link 1999 2003 2008 2023\nEast-West Highway 1,170 1,542 2,430 5,560\nDolalghat-Chautara 70 92 150 330\nBiratnagar-Bardanga 155 269 420 970\nUrlabari-Bardanga 137 180 280 650\nDamak-Gauriganj 156 205 320 740\nPouwa Bhanjyang-Phidim 59a 68 207 502\nHile-Basantpur 98a 112 156 365\na Traffic counts carried out in March 2001.\nSource: TA 2969-NEP: Fourth Road Improvement Project, consultant, and staff estimates.\n                  \n1 Department for International Development. 2001.

Generated  traffic  arises  because  road  improvement  makes  a  journey  more\nattractive as a result of the reduction in travel cost and/or journey time. In the case of the\nEWH, the reductions will not be significant enough to cause any generation of traffic.\nHowever  in  the  case  of  unpaved  roads  where  both  travel  times  and  costs  will  be\nreduced, additional generated passenger traffic is expected, no significant generation of\nfreight traffic is anticipated. The latter is due to the generally small additional savings to\nthe consumer caused by the savings in vehicle operating costs.\n6. In the feasibility study a standard increase in traffic of 30 percent was used for\ncars and utilities, and 15 percent in the case of buses. These rates are based on studies\nof generated traffic then available for similar roads in Nepal. New evidence of much\nhigher levels of traffic generation in the hill areas of the Eastern Region is now available.\nIn  the  study  carried  out  for  the  Operations  Evaluation  Department  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  in  2000,  referred  to  above,  very  high  rates  of  traffic\ngeneration,  especially  of  light  vehicles  carrying  passengers,  have  followed  the\nprogressive completion of the road from the EWH to Ilam. This pattern was confirmed by\ntraffic counts on the improved section of Ilam-Phidim road in March 2001. The current\ntraffic level on the section recently completed under Third Road Improvement Project\n(TRIP) was found to be approximately three times the level forecast. Accordingly the\nPouwa Bhanjyang-Phidim road3 was reevaluated with a generated traffic level of 125\npercent, similar to that on south of Ilam but less than that on the TRIP completed\nsection.\n7. None of the roads included in the Project would offer a better alternative route\nafter implementation than existing roads and no benefits to diverted traffic are included\nin the analysis.\nC. Construction Standards and Project Costs\n8. For the EWH, the only work recommended is a structural (strengthening) overlay\non  the  existing  road.  The  thickness  of  the  overlay  varies  based  on  the  remaining\nstrength of the existing pavement and the expected equivalent standard axles expected\nto traverse the road over the next 20 years. Different design standards have been used\nfor the hill roads and the roads in the terai, as shown in Table A16.3. This is due mainly\nto terrain constraints in the hilly areas and the generally higher traffic on the terai roads.\n                  \n3  This road is the last section of Ilam-Phidim road, canceled from the previous ADB-TRIP owing to\nshortage of funds.", "66\nAppendix 16, page 3\nTable A16.3: Indicative Cross Section and Pavement Structure\nCarriage Way Shoulder\nRoad Section Width (m) Type Width (m) Type\nBelbari - Chuharwa (140 km) 7.0 AC 2 x 1.75 DBST\nBiratnagar - Bardanga (39 km)\nUrlabari - Bardanga (28 km) 3.5 DBST 2 x 2.0 SBST\nDamak - Gauriganj (22 km)\nDolalghat - Chautara (25 km)\nPouwa Bhanjyang - Phidim (24 km) 3.5 DBST 2 x 0.5 SBST\nHile - Basantpur (26 km)\nBasantpur - Khandbari (96 km) 4.5 Gravel N/A N/A\nAC = asphalt concrete; DBST = double bituminous surface treatment; SBST = single bituminous surface\ntreatment; N/A = not applicable\n9. The quantities are based on preliminary engineering, while the financial costs are\nbased  on  a  model  widely  used  in  Nepal  and  verified  by  comparison  with  recently\nawarded and ongoing contracts. Costs include acquired land, construction, supervision,\nand  project  management-related  costs.  Financial  costs  have  been  converted  to\neconomic costs following ADB guidelines with a standard conversion factor of 0.88.\n10. In the case of the upgrading of hill roads where economic internal rates of return\n(EIRRs) were found to be low, a lower cost gravel standard was considered. Because\nthe terrain and climate conditions of the hill areas make maintenance gravel roads\ndifficult, the alternative option tested was a gravel road with sealing on steep grade\nsections. These produced lower EIRRs than the all-sealed standard because the lower\nroad user savings and higher maintenance costs reduced benefits more than the cost\nsavings.\nD. Maintenance\n11. A  set  of  six  maintenance  scenarios  was  set  up  using  the  HDM  manager\nmaintenance policy format. Inputs to the model were derived from the condition of the\nexisting roads and DOR\u2019s maintenance practices. In essence this analysis showed that\nsealed roads were clearly superior to the earth or gravel option for the feeder roads and\nthat the 10-year asphalt concrete overlay for the EWH is superior to providing an asphalt\nconcrete pavement with a full 20-year life. Costs were based on existing unit rates for\nthe  various  maintenance  components.  For  Basantpur-Khandbari,  1.2  percent  of\nconstruction  cost  was  considered  to  be  the  annual  maintenance  cost  based  on\nexperience with roads of similar standard and quality.\nE. Benefits\n12. The major benefits consist of savings to users of the road and cover vehicle\noperating cost savings resulting from improved surface condition and passenger time\nsavings for those for whom time lost has an economic or social value. Typical road user\nsavings, based on opening year surface roughness levels, are shown in Table A16.4. In\nboth  the  with  and  without  project  cases  roughness  levels  vary  from  year  to  year,\naccording  to  traffic  movements  and  maintenance  applied.  The  roughness  levels,\nexpressed in terms of the international roughness index, have a direct impact on vehicle\noperating cost level and hence on benefits. Existing unsealed road surfaces conditions\nresult in generally high roughness levels for the without project case.", "67\nAppendix 16, page 4\nTable A16.4: Vehicle Operating Costs With and Without Improvement (NRs/km)\nRoad Car Utility / Jeep Bus Mini-truck Truck\nSection Without With Without With Without With Without With Without With\nDolalghat \u2013Chautara\n      Section 1 (9 km) 9.1 7.4 15.5 11.8 29.1 24.2 - - 22.5 19.2\n      Section 2 (16 km) 13.8 7.4 24.9 11.8 41.7 24.2 - - 29.2 19.2\nPouwa Bhanjyang \u2013 Phidim 11.5 7.4 20.6 11.7 37.3 24.8 - - 25.9 19.0\nBiratnagar \u2013 Bardanga\n      Section 1 (29 km) 9.7 6.7 15.6 9.3 23.0 14.8 10.7 7.0 13.2 8.8\n      Section 2 (10 km) 16.2 6.7 29.1 9.3 41.5 14.8 18.0 7.0 22.3 8.8\nUrlabari \u2013 Bardanga 14.6 6.7 25.8 9.3 36.8 14.8 16.1 7.0 19.9 8.8\nDamak \u2013 Gauriganj\n     Section 1 (5.9 km) 8.0 6.7 12.2 9.4 18.8 14.8 8.9 7.0 11.1 8.8\n     Section 2  (16.2 km) 14.8 6.7 26.2 9.4 37.4 14.8 16.3 7.0 20.2 8.8\nHile \u2013 Basantpur 13.8 7.4 24.9 11.8 41.7 24.2 - - 29.2 19.2\n- =   not applicable.\nNote: Costs include passenger time savings.\nSource: TA 2969-NEP: Fourth Road Improvement Project, consultant, and staff estimates.\n13. Benefits also accrue to generated traffic that is at present deterred from using the\nroad due poor conditions and seasonal access. The benefits to generated traffic are\ncalculated by assuming the demand curve is linear with respect to cost, and the benefit\nper unit of traffic is half that of existing or normal traffic. In addition maintenance cost\nsavings for those roads to be upgraded to sealed standard is small. This is usually about\n2-3 percent of total benefits, but is about 5 percent in the case of the roads with the\nlowest traffic levels.\n14. For Basantpur-Khandbari, two sources of benefits were evaluated and included:\n(i) incremental benefits resulting from increased agriculture production, and (ii) transport\nuser savings including passenger time savings. Most of the usable land in the zone of\ninfluence is used but with good road access a modest switch to higher value crops is\nassumed, with 4 percent converting to the growing of fruit, vegetables, and pulses,\nproducing an annual producer surplus benefits of about NRs90 million. Transport of\ngoods in the road\u2019s zone of influence is currently carried out by porters at a high cost\nand by foot for passengers at a high time cost. With the new road, freight will transfer to\ntrucks at a considerably lower cost, while pedestrians will transfer to buses, about\nNRs250 per ton kilometer using porters compared with about NRs5.0 by trucks. In\nmountainous areas, people generally walk at a rate of about 4 kilometer (km) per hour\nwhile a bus can travel at 7 to 10 or more times that speed thus saving considerable time\nthat can be used for economic purposes. The value of time saved is based on daily\nwages of about NRs90 and is estimated at NRs2.05 per hour. The annual cost savings\nare estimated at NRs9,448 per km.\nF. Economic analysis\n15. The economic evaluation discounts the stream of benefits and costs over a 25-\nyear evaluation period from the present.

Sensitivity Analysis\n16. The sensitivity of each road component\u2019s EIRR was analyzed with respect to\nchanges in the benefit and cost streams (Table A16.6). The tests applied for road\nimprovement component are (i) delayed completion by 1 year, (ii) increase construction\ncosts by 20 percent, (iii) reduce normal and generated traffic vehicle operating cost\nbenefits by 20 percent, (iv) reduce traffic growth rates by 50 percent, and (v) exclude\nvalue of time benefits.\n17. A one-year delay in obtaining benefits as a result of delayed completion reduces\nthe viability of the roads. A slightly larger impact occurs with either a 20 percent increase\nin construction costs or a 20 percent reduction in benefits. Excluding passenger time\nsavings has a higher negative impact on viability, except in the case of the Basantpur-\nKhandbari Road, where passenger time savings are a very small component of benefits.\nThe EIRRs for all the other hill road projects fall to close to 12 percent or below.\nReducing traffic growth by 50 percent causes major reductions in benefit levels in the\nlater years of the evaluation period, but the impact on EIRRs is generally only a little\nlarger than that of the other tests.  However in the case of the roads with the lowest\nrates of return this impact is very significant. The switching values for the overall project\nare 165 percent higher for costs and 86 percent lower for benefits.\nTable A16.6: Sensitivity Tests of Road Improvement Components (EIRR - %)\nConst.

Background\n1.  Poverty in the Project Area\n1. Participatory rapid assessment (PRA) was conducted to gain insights into the\nexisting situation of the communities in the project area. The population data for the\nproject roads are shown in Table A17.1, which shows variations in population growth\nrates in each of the road areas; this reflects the effects of seasonal and long-term, out-\nmigration from the hills to the terai.\nTable A17.1: Poverty Incidence in the Project Area (1999)\nRoad District Total NLSS% PRA% Landless\nPopulation BPL BPL Households\n%\nP.Bhanjyang-Phidim Pancthar 17,324 68 45 29\nBiratnagar -Bardanga Morang 72,151 27 40 21\nUlarbari - Bardanga Morang 107,302 27 55 21\nDamak -Gauriganj Jhapa 53,758 27 50 23\nDolalghat - Chautara Sindupalchok 32,698 31 80 52\nBelbari-Chuharwa Morang, Sunsari 452,867 27 27 10\nSaptari, Siraha\nBasantpur-Khandbari Sankhuwasabha 151,342 73 73 52\nHile-Basantpur Sankhuwasabha; 178,175 68 68 48\nDhankuta\nBPL =  below poverty line, NLSS = national living standard survey.\nSource: TA 2969-NEP: Fourth Road Improvement Project.\n2. Most  landholdings  in  the  project  area  are  between  1  to  2  hectares  (ha).\nLandholdings are fragmented as a result of the rapid growth of the population and a lack\nof agricultural land available for expansion. This is a particular problem in the hill areas\nwhere suitable land is restricted by slope and soil type.\n3. Rural  households  rely  on  agriculture  for  the  main  source  of  income.  The\ngenerally  small  land  plots  do  not  allow  sufficient  production  to  feed  families.  Poor\nhouseholds can produce about three months supply of food for their families and have to\nsupplement this production with food bought from wages paid for daily labor. However,\nincome from wage labor is low. Deficits in income are frequently covered by borrowing\ncash or food at high rates of interest from wealthy landowners. Seasonal migration to the\nterai from the hill areas produces an important source of income.\n4. The 1999 National Living Standards Surveys (NLSS) figures for poverty in Nepal\ngive an annual per capita income of Nrs7,075 as the poverty level in the hill and\nNrs5,633 for the terai areas. The national average income per capita approximates\nNrs9,700. Data for the incidence of poverty in the project road areas is shown in Table\nA17.1. The highest level of poverty recorded in the NLSS was in the Pouwa Bhanjyang-", "71\nAppendix 17, page 2\nPhidim road with 68 percent of the household were below the poverty line (between 45\nto 50 percent of the households in the PRA). Very high levels of poverty were also found\nalong  the  Dolalghat-Chautara  section,  85  percent  compared  with  the  NLSS  district\naverage of 31 percent.\n5. Using the NLSS figures of 438,796 people of a total population of 1,065,617\n(41.2 percent) affected by the project, have incomes below the poverty line. The PRA\nexercise figures yielded slightly higher overall estimates of poverty at 502,622 persons\nliving below the poverty line, representing about 47.2 percent of project beneficiaries.\n6. As  in  the  case  of  income  and  poverty,  large  disparities  are  seen  in  social\nindicators across regions and socioeconomic groups. People in rural areas are twice as\nlikely to be literate as those in urban areas. Illiteracy rates are the highest among\ndisadvantaged groups. The other social indicators such as access to health, education,\nand safe drinking water are lower in rural areas as compared with those in urban areas.\n7. The PRA found that the Brahmin/Chhetri/Newar groups (BCNs) dominate on the\nterai roads with considerable populations of occupational castes and some migrant hill\ntribes. The hill tribes along with some BCNs dominate the hill areas in the east. The\nBCNs  dominate  on  the  Dolalghat-Chautara  road  with  significant  occupational  caste\ngroups.\n2. Community Perceptions\n8. The PRA exercise addressed how people in the different income groups in the\nproject area would benefit from the project and also if these benefits were meaningful to\nthem. The PRA also asked about people\u2019s perceptions of opportunities that the project\nwould  bring,  which  were  determined  as  (i)  improved  transport  and  lower  costs,  (ii)\nincreased  mobility  and  access  to  school  and  health  facilities,  (iii)  new  employment\nopportunities, and (iv) employment on the construction of the Project.\n9. Business and trading households expected lower transport costs and increased\nbusiness  levels.  Wage  labor  expected  increased  opportunity  for  paid  employment.\nWomen focused on increased mobility and access to health and educational facilities\nwhile men emphasized the economic benefits of access to markets and employment\nopportunities.  Hill  communities  emphasized  improved  access  to  markets  while  terai\ncommunities  emphasized  improved  mobility,  and  access  to  schools,  and  reduced\ntransportation fares and charges as the main benefit from the project.\n3. Representative Roads of the Project Areas\n10. The Project roads consist of\n(i)  East-West Highway (EWH): Belbari-Chuharwa;\n(ii)  Central Region: Dolalghat-Chaurawa;\n(iii)  Terai  roads:  Biratnagar-Bardanga,  Urlabari-Bardanga,  and  Damak-\nGauriganj;\n(iv)  East  hill  roads:  Hile-Basantpur,  Basantpur-Khandbari,  and  Pouwa\nBhanjyang-Phidim.", "72\nAppendix 17, page 3\n11. For the purpose of analysis of benefits distribution and poverty impact ratio, four\nroads were selected as representative roads as follows: Belbari-Chuharwa, Dolalghat-\nChautara, Biratnagar-Bardanga, and Pouwa Bhanjyang-Phidim.\n4. Poverty Impact Analysis\n12. Economic Development Impact. The project roads would have a positive effect\non  agriculture,  increase  business  activities,  generate  more  employment,  as  well  as\nimprove access to health and education facilities. The reduction in vehicle operating\ncosts (VOCs) may lead to a reduction in the cost of goods and services in the area. If\ncompetition  increases  between  freight  companies  for  the  transport  of  agricultural\nproduce then this may eventually be passed on to local farmers by way of reduced\nfreight rates. The increase in the demand for agricultural products and the expansion of\nthe service sector to satisfy this demand will create employment within the transport\nsector for the rural poor. More opportunities will be available for work for drivers of both\nmotorized and nonmotorized transport, and more labor will be required for loading and\nunloading vehicles. This will necessitate an increase in businesses that service and\nrepair transport vehicles, which will also provide more employment opportunities.\n13. Poverty Reduction through Employment. The Project will need approximately\n1,000 jobs for unskilled labor. Each construction project takes on average 2.5 years,\nimplying approximately 912,500 person-days. At the existing approximate daily wage\nrate for unskilled labor of Nrs80, this approximates a total income to unskilled labor of\nNrs73.0 million (about $1.0 million). Although the employment created through road\nconstruction  activities  is  short  term  during  the  construction  process,  unskilled  labor\nwould be able to be trained to follow on the project construction phase with the proper\nmaintenance techniques. Application of the \u201clength worker\u201d1 concept will assist in the\nmaintenance of these roads. This ensures that those living directly alongside the road\ntake up employment opportunities arising from maintenance requirements. The effect of\nusing labor from the project road areas to assist in maintenance would sustain income\nfor the poor people of the area on a long-term basis.\n14. The improvement in the roads will encourage increase of agricultural products\ndue to a more efficient and faster way to surrounding market areas. At the present time\nfew storage facilities are available for agricultural produce and perishable crops; this has\nresulted in crops being produced on a small scale for local consumption. The increase in\nagricultural activity is likely to lead to an increase in nonmotorized transport employment\nopportunities. Improved access will allow greater mobility and enable people to travel to\nwork and to health, education, and other services. The road projects will facilitate labor\nmobility to other areas in search of work.\n15. Impact on Human Poverty. The improvement of the project roads will enable\nthe  poor  in  the  influence  area  of  the  roads  greater  accessibility  to  other  services,\nschools, and hospitals, which at the present time are limited and involve long trip times\nto  qualified  facilities.  Travel  time  will  be  decreased  and  facilities  can  be  reached\nefficiently. The rate of attendance in school will increase, directly leading to a reduction\nin the rate of illiteracy.\n                                                          \n1  Each length worker is assigned to a specific section of road, responsible for regular and routine\nmaintenance of the road.", "73\nAppendix 17, page 4\n16. Reduced Vehicle Operating Cost Impacts. The main economic benefit is in the\nform of reduced VOC to both passenger and freight transport, accruing to the operator of\nthe vehicle including bus company, freight company, car driver, etc. VOC savings in a\ncompetitive market are also passed on to the individual user of the transport service, in\nthe form of lower bus fares or a fall in the freight rate. Traffic on all representative roads\nconsists of mainly buses and trucks. A saving to the vehicle operator of the bus or freight\ncompanies through the reduction in VOC may be passed on to the individual in the form\nof lower fares or freight rates.\n17. Impact on Women. Some of the unskilled labor positions could be allocated to\nwomen. Women could also be involved in road activities by selling food and water to the\nroad crews. Those living directly alongside the road take up employment opportunities\narising from maintenance requirements. In particular this would benefit those women\nwhose mobility is generally restricted by culture and domestic responsibilities.\nB.  Methodology\n18. The economic benefits of the Project consist of road user benefits, i.e., VOC,\ntime savings, and savings in maintenance costs of the project roads. The distribution\nsubdivides these economic benefits to both passenger and freight vehicles, between\nowners/operators and passengers of vehicles, and also the Government. The benefits\nare then divided into those that would reach the poor and the nonpoor.\nD. Distribution Analysis\n19. Based on surveys undertaken in each of the representative project roads area\nthe following assumptions have been made in terms of what will be passed on to the\nuser of the services:\n(i)  bus operators will pass on to the user 20 percent of the savings they\nreceive in the form of reduced fares;\n(ii)  freight operator will pass 50 percent of the savings on to the user;\n(iii)  of  the  benefits  that  are  distributed  to  cars  and  pickup  vehicles,  the\ngovernment is allocated a share of 13 percent; and\n(iv)  of the benefits distributed to trucks, the government is allocated a share\nof 7 percent of the total benefits attributable to trucks.\n20. The estimated direct benefits of the representative roads to the economy in\npresent value terms are presented in Table A17.2, using a discount rate of 12 percent.\nThese simply represent the sum of the present value of benefits to passengers, freight\nusers, vehicle owners, and the Government.\nTable A17.2.

Poverty Impact Ratio\n21. To  determine  how  much  of  those  benefits  will  be  passed  on  to  the  poor,\nassumptions have to be made as to how each mode of transport will pass on some of its\nbenefits to the poor based on surveys undertaken along each of the representative\nroads as follows:\n(i)  between 70 to 80 percent of the people are poor;\n(ii)  20 percent of the passengers of cars and pickups are poor;\n(iii)  20 percent of all farmers using truck to transport agricultural produce to\nmarket;\n(iv)  most bus passengers traveled 4 to 5 times a week and on a regular basis;\n(v)  a large number of subsistence farmers also use bus transport as they\nwork as wage labor on neighboring farms, or in small local industries.\n22. The poor's share in Nepal\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) is assumed to be 15.1\npercent.  If  unskilled  labor  for  project  is  used  for  roads  improvement  activities,  this\napproximates a total income to unskilled labor of Nrs73.0 million ($1.0 million) for the 2.5\nyear implementation period, distributed on equal yearly basis. The EWH is unlikely to\nneed unskilled labor, and income to the poor over construction period in each of other 3\nrepresentative roads was estimated as Nrs8.76 million. The shadow wage rate factor\napplying to unskilled labor in Nepal is approximately 0.75, to be used to convert the\nfinancial costs into economic values.  The assumptions used for allocating road user\nbenefits to the poor are shown in Table A17.3.\nTable A17.3: Road User Benefits Allocation\nItem Bus Freight Government\nProportion of savings passed on by operator 20% 50% Net Benefit\nProportion of these savings going to the poor 80% 20% 15%\n23. A sensitivity analysis has been undertaken to examine the effect of changing\nsome of the key assumptions in the analysis and calculation of the poverty impact ratio.\nThe poverty impact ratio increases with increases in competition. This illustrates the\nimportance of enhancing competition in the transport market to help reduce poverty.\nWhen time benefits are reduced, the poverty impact ratio cannot be calculated for the\nDolalghat-Chautara  and  Pouwa  Bhanjyang-Phidim  roads  as  net  present  values  fall\nbelow zero. The total of the benefits accruing to the poor for the representative roads,\nthe poverty impact ratio, and the result of sensitivity analysis on the poverty impact ratio\nare presented in Table A17.4. The high poverty impact ratios, particularly for the Pouwa\nBhanjyang-Phidim road, imply a large net cost to the Government and the economy.\nTable A17.4: Net Benefits for the Poor, Poverty Impact Ratio, and Sensitivity Test\nBelbari- Dolalghat- Biratnagar P.Bhanjyang-\nItem\nChuharwa Chautara -Bardanga Phidim\nBenefits for the poor (NRs million) 728.54 11.33 63.09 9.87\nBase poverty impact ratio (PIR) 0.33 1.53 0.55 7.77\n50% reduction in competition (PIR) 0.30 1.09 0.47 5.70\n50% increase in competition (PIR) 0.35 1.97 0.64 9.84\n50% reduction in time benefits (PIR) 0.22 \u2013 0.42 \u2013\n\u2013 =  not applicable, PIR = poverty impact ratio.\nSource: Distribution Analysis, consultant report."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20011113162404", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "j3m", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R218-01.doc", "ModDate": "D:20011213140748+08'00'"}}
