THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Philippines for the Local Governance Reform Project. \n \n2.  The project will help the Government of the Philippines boost local government revenue \nmobilization to improve local public service delivery and strengthen local governance. The focus \nwill be on improvements to the administration of the real property tax (RPT) and on management \nreforms. In particular, the project will (i) support institutional development and policy formulation \nfor property valuation, (ii) implement a property tax valuation database and information systems, \n(iii)  enhance  the  RPT  administration  for  selected  local  government  units  (LGUs),  and \n(iv) professionalize  local  assessors  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  LGUs.  The  project \ncomplements the programmatic approach of the Local Governance Reform Program, which was \napproved in November 2019.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development challenges. Strong economic growth in the Philippines has yet to deliver \nequitable benefits to its citizens. From 2011 to 2019, gross domestic product (GDP) grew on \naverage at 6.2% per year, higher than the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\u2019 median GDP \ngrowth rate of 5.7% for 2018.2 However, this growth did not result in a significant reduction of \nlong-standing disparities in the Philippines. The country's income inequality exceeds that of \nregional peers, and national averages mask significant regional variation.3 The national poverty \nincidence fell from 26.6% in 2006 to 16.6% in 2018 but remains among the highest in Southeast \nAsia. The poverty incidence is rising in parts of eastern Visayas and in southern and western \nMindanao; in these areas, the poverty incidence can exceed 30.0%. Women are especially at \nrisk; poverty incidence among women in the former Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao \nreached 55.1% in 2017.4 The country\u2019s geographic diversity also creates unique development \nchallenges, and service delivery costs can be extremely high in many remote parts. Local \ngovernments  can  help  reduce  such  disparities  and  create  opportunities  for  economic \ndevelopment, but accountable service delivery depends on well-calibrated intergovernmental \nrelations and appropriate resourcing in line with local governments\u2019 roles and responsibilities. \n \n4.  Impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 is exacting a \nheavy toll on the Philippines with the economy expected to contract by 1% or more in 2020, and \nthe potential for a sharp increase in both poverty and unemployment. Fiscal pressures are also \nincreasing as pandemic response requirements result in new expenditures, and revenues are \nsqueezed due to reduced trade, investment, and economic activity. These factors add new \nurgency to the domestic resource mobilization agenda. Local government revenue mobilization \nwill be necessary to support critical relief activities and to provide local governments with the \nnecessary resources for economic recovery. Land and property values are relatively inelastic and \nare likely to be less affected by the pandemic than other revenue sources. As a result, COVID-19 \nmay have a positive effect on incentives for property tax reform, as revenue needs mount and \nother revenue sources such as income and consumption tax are compressed, encouraging both \ncentral and local governments to pursue property tax reforms.  \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019.

Compared  with  regional  peers,  the  Philippines  is  significantly \ndecentralized in administrative and political dimensions.5 Local government is broadly divided into \nthree levels: provinces and independent cities, municipalities, and barangays. As of 31 December \n2019, the country had 81 provinces, 145 cities, 1,488 municipalities, and 42,045 barangays.6 \nHowever, fiscal matters are relatively less decentralized, especially when it comes to revenue \nmobilization. About 29% of LGU revenue is from local own sources (raised by local governments \nthemselves), the rest comes from central transfers; this compares with an average of more than \n40% own-source revenues (OSR) raised by local governments in industrial economies.7 In most \ndecentralized systems, land and property taxes typically represent an important source of revenue \nfor  local  governments;  however,  in  the  Philippines,  the  property  tax  administered  by  local \ngovernments accounted for only 28% of all local OSR (or 9% of total revenues), compared with \n44% from business tax and 28% from nontax revenues.8 \n \n6.  Property tax. Property tax collection in the Philippines is low for several reasons. RPT is \nimposed on land and structures based on the assessed value of the property, and LGUs exercise \nsignificant  control  over  the  setting  of  rate  and  assessment  levels.  However,  political  and \ninstitutional challenges create conflicting incentives for local officials, which prevent revenue \noptimization. The schedule of market values (SMV), which is the basis for property assessments, \nis heavily influenced by local electoral politics, which discourages regular updates. True market \nvalues are shown to be 2 to 75 times higher than assessed values.9 The politicization of the SMV \nalso creates an opening for rent seeking: the decision to update the SMV is timed to the \npreference of decision makers, in consideration of taxpayers, or to attract investments on the \nbasis of lower property taxes. This causes inconsistencies between property valuations by LGUs \nand the Bureau of Internal Revenue on which capital gains taxes from the sale of a property are \ncalculated and collected. Although national valuation standards and methods are improving, weak \ncapacity of local valuation staff results in inconsistent valuation systems. Coupled with poor record \nkeeping and outdated reporting systems, real property values are distorted. Moreover, RPTs \ncollected as a percentage of GDP declined from 0.45% in 2004 to 0.35% in 2016. Acknowledging \nthese valuation constraints, the Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) estimates that in \nthe same period, provinces and municipalities missed collecting \u20b19.4 billion10 in forgone property \ntax revenues, while cities could have collected an additional \u20b120.3 billion. \n \n7.  Reform measures. The government has embarked on various reforms to strengthen local \ngovernance and mobilize local revenues, submitting to Congress several amendments to the \nLocal Government Code with the intention of updating the legal framework for local governance. \nThe amendments cover revenue provisions, such as aligning business tax collection with the \ngeographic area in which the business activities take place, harmonizing fees and fines across \nLGUs to reduce uncertainty for investors, and increasing local autonomy in the use of revenues \nfrom natural resources (footnote 1). The government also proposed a new real property valuation \nand assessment reform act (RPVARA) to Congress. If passed, a single valuation base would \napply to all property taxation purposes of national and local governments; reviews of compliance \nwith valuation standards would be compulsory; and the approval of the SMV would be handled \ncentrally again by the Department of Finance (DOF) to ensure valuation of real property is not \n \n5  M.

The DOF will prescribe valuation standards, build capacity of local appraisers \nand assessors, and develop an up-to-date property information system consisting of an electronic \ndatabase of real property transactions from the LGUs and other stakeholders such as the private \nsector. The proposed law will also make LGUs ineligible for conditional or performance-based \ngrants and prevent them from accessing credit financing if they do not update their SMVs \nregularly. Under this proposed legislation, the government estimates that RPT revenues would \nincrease by \u20b112.6 billion ($252 million), including \u20b13.7 billion ($74 million) for provinces and \nmunicipalities and \u20b18.9 billion ($178 million) for cities. Additional measures to improve collection \nefficiency under the RPVARA are expected to add around \u20b130 billion ($600 million) in local tax \ncollections.11 \n \n8.  Binding constraints. In reforming the administration of the RPT, the government faces \nthree primary constraints. First, the Philippines does not have a structured and institutionalized \nmechanism  or  body  to  implement  and  sustain  real  property  valuation  reforms.  The  many \ninstitutions and agencies involved in land management and taxation have overlapping and \nsometimes conflicting roles and mandates. The legal framework for land management is complex, \nand no duly organized and recognized national appraisal service exists. Complex revenue \nmobilization  reforms  typically  require  multiple  years  of  commitment.  The  absence  of  an \nestablished body that can sustain the reform momentum raises the risk of incomplete or ad hoc \nreform implementation. Likewise, international standards and methods for property valuation exist \nand continue to evolve, but the absence of an institutionalized body of practitioners in the \nPhilippines  forestalls  the  opportunity  to  transfer  this  knowledge  to  a  professional  cadre  of \nassessors. The result is a significant variation in the approach and methodology of property \nvaluation across the Philippines, increased administrative costs, and lower tax compliance. \n \n9.  Second, the Philippines does not have a consistent, reliable property information and \nvaluation database for record keeping of the true market value of land. Multiple central and local \nagencies have fragmented responsibilities for different dimensions of land management and \nrecord keeping. While some LGUs have developed individual property information and valuation \ndata systems, these are ad hoc, and the quality varies significantly across LGUs. Individual \nsystems may use different protocols, classifications, and data formats, compromising the ability \nof central oversight agencies to obtain a consistent set of data on property values. Some LGUs \nalso rely on private sector actors to prepare and maintain property valuation information. This \ntends to result in inconsistent valuations prepared by different government agencies and private \nentities and reflecting varying values for similarly located and comparable properties. In the \nabsence of a unified data standard and policy for data sharing, administrators of property taxes \nface serious difficulties in establishing an integrated information technology tax system and linking \ninformation from different government agencies and the private sector. \n \n10.  Third, property taxation is fraught with political, institutional, and administrative challenges. \nTax reforms are often complex undertakings; national reforms which are to be implemented by a \nlarge number of local government stakeholders are even more so. Past efforts to increase \nproperty tax collections have been stymied by the absence of a well-articulated strategy to \naddress  these  challenges,  particularly  incentive  and  accountability  mechanisms  which  will \nsupport consistent reform implementation across diverse localities. For reform measures to be \nsuccessful, an appropriate balance of autonomy and accountability is needed in order to influence \nproperty tax policy and its administration. The mobilization of property tax revenue must be linked \nto improved levels of responsive, efficient, and accountable service delivery. \n \n \n11 BLGF calculations, June 2019. \n ", "4 \n11.  Government  strategy.  The  government  has  a  renewed  focus  on  the  role  of  local \ngovernments in delivering quality services and promoting local economic development. The \nPhilippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022 underscores the importance of local government in \npromoting local investment, social protection, and other service delivery.12 The government also \nmade land management reform a part of its priority agenda for economic development, including \nensuring the security of land titling to encourage investments, and addressing bottlenecks in land \nadministration and titling agencies.13 The Department of Environment and Natural Resources in \nparticular is pursuing updates to the Land Sector Development Framework (2010\u20132030) with \nsupport from the Food and Agriculture Organization.14 Under the pillar of \u201cEnsuring Sound \nMacroeconomic Policy,\u201d the Philippine Development Plan targets an increase in local sources of \nLGU revenue (footnote 12). Local revenue mobilization is prioritized in both revisions to the Local \nGovernment Code of 1991 and the proposed RPVARA (para. 6). \n \n12.  Strategic alignment. The project is aligned with Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB).15 Table 1 shows the specific links with the operational priorities of Strategy 2030. \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Project Intervention \nAddressing remaining poverty and  Strengthen local service delivery and foster local economic opportunities \nreducing inequalities  to reduce regional disparities \nAccelerating progress in gender equality  Reduced compliance burden and improved services for women-owned \nbusinesses; gender informed policy development for real property tax \nMaking cities more livable  Mobilize revenues to support accountable municipal service delivery  \nStrengthening governance and  Professionalize local assessors and strengthen  the capacity of local \ninstitutional capacity  government units \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13.  Development  coordination.  ADB  plays  a  leading  role  in  local  governance  in  the \nPhilippines  and  coordinates  support  with  other  development  partners  so  that  efforts  are  \nwell-aligned and complementary to the government\u2019s overall agenda. ADB meets regularly with \nthe United States Agency for International Development on local infrastructure development and \nregional assistance to Mindanao. ADB is also coordinating closely with the Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  on  advisory  services  and  capacity  building  for  the  newly  established \nBangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. ADB coordinates with the World Bank on \npublic financial management reforms, particularly the links between national efforts (supported by \nthe World Bank) and subnational efforts (supported by the ADB), as well as on revenue reforms. \nADB has worked on local governance issues with Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (French \nDevelopment Agency), which also provided technical assistance to the government, including a \nstudy on the French approach to inter-LGU service delivery coordination. \n \nB.

Output  1:  Institutional  development  and  policy  support  for  property  valuation \nstrengthened. The project will support policy formulation and institutional development within the \nBLGF to implement fair, efficient, and effective property valuation. The activities under this output \ninclude: (i) the establishment and operationalization of the real property valuation service (RPVS) \nwithin the BLGF to strengthen property valuation, institutionalize good international practices on \nvaluation, and support the operational work of other BLGF divisions; (ii) policy formulation and \nimplementation support for real property taxation, focusing on the gender and development \ndimensions of tax administration and compliance management; (iii) formulation and dissemination \nof  operating  manuals  and  procedures  aligned  with  international  standards  on  valuation; \n(iv) comprehensive nationwide rollout of training for central government agencies and regional \nBLGF  offices;  and (v) formulation  of  policies  and  processes  for compliance  monitoring  on \nvaluation standards for public and private real property. Previous ADB experience on land \nadministration reform has shown that stakeholder consultation is critical. To build a constituency \nfor reform, this output will also cover consultations with national oversight and implementing \nagencies, such as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, LGUs, and the private \nsector, including female property owners and the Philippine Commission on Women. \n \n16.  Output 2: Property tax valuation database and information systems implemented. \nThis output will result in more accurate and timely real property valuation data and greater \ntransparency and accountability in the reporting of real property-related transactions. Activities \ninclude: (i) development, operationalization, and nationwide rollout of a real property information \nsystem and of an electronic field appraisal and assessment sheet for maintaining property data \nand  computing  real  property  valuations;  (ii)  development  and  operationalization  of  a \ncomprehensive electronic property tax billing and payment system; (iii) rollout of the electronic \nproperty  tax  billing  and  payment  system  in  selected  municipalities;  (iv)  development  and \noperationalization  of  an  online  portal for  public  access  to the  SMV,  local  tax  codes,  local \ninvestment and incentives code, ecozone information, and LGU performance in property tax \ncollection;  (v)  development  and  implementation  of  institutional  mechanisms  for  data  and \ninformation exchange between public and private sector stakeholders; and (vi) development of a \ncomputer-assisted  mass  appraisal system  and its rollout  to selected  cities,  integrated  with \ngeographic information system technologies. These activities will be coordinated closely with the \nBureau of Internal Revenue, DOF, Department of Information and Communications Technology, \nDepartment of the Interior and Local Government, private sector, civil society, and women\u2019s \ngroups.  The  proposed  database  and  information  systems  will  enable  the  collection  of  \nsex-disaggregated data to ascertain women\u2019s contributions to LGU revenues. \n \n17.  Output 3: Real property taxation of selected LGUs enhanced. Newly created cities, \nmunicipalities, and provinces exhibit a particularly high dependence on fiscal transfers from the \ncentral government. The project will provide targeted assistance to selected LGUs to help \ndecrease this dependence. Activities include: (i) technical support, coaching, and mentoring on \nSMV updates and on a general revision of assessments and property classification, with specific \ntargets for participation across different sectors; (ii) updates of tax maps and related tax records; \n(iii)  more  in-depth  assistance  with  the  adoption  of  integrated  electronic  systems  for  tax \nassessment and collection; (iv) more in-depth assistance with the preparation of tax and revenue \nimpact studies incorporating gender and development perspectives; (v) tax compliance reviews \n \n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "6 \nto improve the collection of property taxes; and (vi) strengthening of compliance management \npractices, e.g., by conducting taxpayer registration drives and updating taxpayers\u2019 registries.17 \nWhile the property maps generated will be used primarily for tax purposes, they can be combined \nwith  other  information  systems  to  conduct  asset  valuations  for  disaster  risk  financing  and \ninsurance under other government programs. \n \n18.  Output 4: Local assessors professionalized and capacity of LGUs strengthened. \nThe project will focus on developing and sustaining a professional cadre of assessors to meet \npublic and private sector needs. The output is also aligned with efforts under the Real Estate \nService Act, 2009 for professional assessment and valuations services in coordination with state \nuniversities and colleges, the Professional Regulation Commission, and the Commission on \nHigher Education. Activities include: (i) conducting a diagnostic study and mapping the core \ncompetencies for local assessors and appraisers; (ii) developing expanded academic and training \ncourse curricula and performance assessment programs with training manuals, through a partner \nstate university or college and a training institution; (iii) developing and implementing an e-learning \nplatform for assessing appraisers and assessors; (iv) rolling out provincial, city, and municipal \ntraining for local assessors; and (v) reviewing and harmonizing inconsistent government policies \nrelated to academic programs and capacity building for property valuation. The BLGF will \ncoordinate closely with academic institutions that offer training in valuation, assessment, and local \nadministration  to  deliver  this  output.  The  BLGF  will  also  initiate  a  capacity  development \narrangement with an international academic and training institution, and participate in selected \ninternational training events, seminars, conferences, and technical exchange programs to further \nadvance and promote property valuation practices in the country. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n19.  The  project  complements  a  broader  program  of  ADB  support  for  local  economic \ndevelopment in the Philippines. Specifically, the project supports implementation of the Local \nGovernance Reform Program, a policy-based loan approved in November 2019 that targets policy \nreforms to strengthen the legal and institutional basis for local governance in the Philippines, \nmodernize local public financial management, and strengthen local economic development and \nfinancing options (footnote 1). While the policy-based loan supports the legal and institutional \nframework for local revenue mobilization, the proposed project will support national and local \ngovernment  implementation  of  the  policy changes.  ADB  also  provided  significant technical \nassistance to support the preparation of the project, the preparation of the RPVARA, a review of \nlocal government systems for the electronic monitoring of revenue and expenditure, and policy \nadvisory services for project design. The project is especially critical in the context of the COVID-\n19 pandemic and the urgent need to mobilize resources and support economic recovery for LGUs. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $31.49 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).18 \n \n \n17 The proposed project draws on technical assistance provided by ADB in 2011 for local government revenue \ngeneration and land administration reforms, which showed the need for a demand-driven approach and for local and \nnational governments working in partnership to sustain reforms. The project tackles the problems previously \nencountered with small-scale or short-lived support for land and property tax reforms by scaling up resources and \ninstitutionalizing reform mechanisms for the future.

The government has requested a regular loan of $26,532,604 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 28-year term, including a grace period \nof 9 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 18.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per year. \n \n22.  The summary financing plan is in Table 3. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \nproject  implementation  consultants:  (i)  procurement  of  information  technology  equipment, \nsoftware, and hardware; (ii) furniture and fixtures; (iii) vehicles; (iv) capacity development and \ntwinning programs; (v) operational expenses of the project management unit; (vi) annual audit \ncosts; and (vii) cost of labor and materials for the construction of training centers.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n24.  The economic impacts of the project are expected to be substantial. Benefits accrue from: \n(i) an increase in LGU spending to produce economic benefits from investments and service \ndelivery; (ii) better quality of local spending through local taxation alignment with local needs and \npreferences; (iii) reduced reliance on distortionary nontax revenues, including fees and fines; and \n(iv) more efficient allocation of capital and development of unused land. The economic analysis \nestimated potential net economic benefits of the project under various assumptions of efficiency \ngains expected through the listed channels. Using conservative estimates of 2% efficiency gains, \nthe economic analysis estimates the project\u2019s potential net economic benefits at $400 million.19 \n \nB.  Sustainability \n \n25.  The project will institutionalize mechanisms to support professional real property valuation \nand assessment functions in the Philippines. In doing so, the project will help ensure that \ninternational good practice on property tax administration and property valuation is absorbed and \nsustained over the long term. Investments in digital systems will help the government establish \nand sustain a historical record of land and property values using modern and consistent valuation \n \n19 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nstandards. Partnerships with local academic institutions and training facilities will help ensure that \ncompetency frameworks, curricula, and course materials for local assessors can be delivered on \nan ongoing basis, resulting in a sustainable cadre of professional assessors for the public and \nprivate sectors. The project also supports the implementation of the RPVARA, which will underpin \nthe sustainability of reforms. While the project team envisages significant consulting services, the \ngovernment plans to absorb mission-critical personnel under the operating budget for the RPVS \nsubject to satisfactory performance and relevance. The additional tax revenues collected and the \ngovernment budget for the RPVS will more than cover the cost of servicing the project loan, the \nprincipal repayment, and operations; as such, the project is considered financially viable. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  The financial management assessment (FMA) conducted  during October\u2013November \n2018 followed ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and \nFinancial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note.20 Based on the FMA, the pre-mitigation financial \nmanagement risk is substantial. The key financial management risks are (i) the BLGF\u2019s financial \nmanagement division has staffing shortcomings, (ii) the BLGF\u2019s fixed asset registry requires \nstrengthening, (iii) the BLGF is not subject to internal audit, and (iv) financial reporting can be \ndelayed due to the absence of computerized budgeting and bookkeeping systems. However, the \nFMA found the BLGF\u2019s capacity to administer advance fund and statement of expenditures \nprocedures to be adequate. The risks will be managed by establishing a project management unit \nto undertake regular financial management responsibilities. The BLGF also agreed to implement \nan action plan to rectify the deficiencies. The FMA and the related action plan are discussed in \ndetail in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  and  the  BLGF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  Reforms under the project will help the government achieve its poverty reduction targets \nby expanding the quality and range of public services available to the poor, and by providing \nopportunities  for  local  economic  development.  Local  revenue  mobilization  increases  the \nresources available to LGUs for delivering public services to poor and marginalized groups. \nReducing LGUs\u2019 reliance on transfers from the central government will improve the quality of local \nspending, as LGUs must balance its spending against taxation. The project is categorized some \ngender elements. Improvements in the tax administration and a reduction in the compliance \nburden will specifically benefit women entrepreneurs and owners of small and medium-sized \nenterprises, who are least able to bear the costs of cumbersome tax administration. The project \nalso has built-in monitoring for sex-disaggregated data. Planned tax compliance and impact \nstudies will incorporate an explicit gender dimension to understand how the RPT affects different \ntaxpayers, including women and other marginalized groups. Finally, ADB will recruit a gender \nconsultant to strengthen the project\u2019s gender dimensions. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories  are  as  follows:  category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \n \n20 ADB. 2005.
