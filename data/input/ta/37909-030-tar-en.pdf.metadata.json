Since being launched in 2003, ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program (TFP) has supported $36.9 \nbillion in trade and mobilized $21.9 billion in cofinancing. The TFP conducts approximately 100 \ndue diligence and annual reviews per year, enabling it to provide guarantees and loans through \npartner banks. This closes market gaps for trade finance and supports more trade, leading to \neconomic growth and job creation. Information from due diligence and annual reviews will enable \nTFP to share knowledge that will help attract cofinancing and international investment in DMCs, \nthereby closing trade finance market gaps.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n2.  The technical assistance cluster was approved by the Board on 11 April 2018 and \ncomplements ADB's nonsovereign operations in trade and trade facilitation projects.1 It is linked \nto ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan and Work Program and Budget Framework, 2017\u2013\n2019, as well numerous strategies and business opportunities presented in country strategy \npapers, regional cooperation strategies and programs, and country operations business plans for \nADB's DMCs.2 The technical assistance cluster builds on ongoing work under TA projects started \nin 2009, 2013, 2014, and 2015.3 \n \n3.  Subproject 1 funded TFP\u2019s due diligence activities on partner banks from May 2018 to \nJuly 2019. During this period, 12 new bank assessments, 10 preliminary analyses of potential \nTFP issuing bank candidates, 123 bank monitoring assessments, 17 banking system analyses, 5 \nannual reviews of existing risk distribution partners and 2 trainings/ workshops have been \ndelivered.  \n \nB.  Subproject Scope  \n4.  Similar to the first subproject, subproject 2 will provide the TFP with funding to conduct \ndue diligence on partner banks and financial institutions. Financial analysts will be engaged \nthrough a firm from 2019 to 2020 to work with the TFP to conduct due diligence and ongoing \nannual reviews of participating banks and partner financial institutions. Subproject 2 will also \ninclude capacity building through in- country seminars and trainings.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities  \n5.  Output 1: Capacity to provide trade finance and guarantees by developing member \ncountry  banks  enhanced.  Assessments  of  new  and  existing  banks  and  partner  financial \ninstitutions will be conducted under the TA by consultants who will support TFP relationship \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 Feb 2018. \n2  ADB. 2011.

Due diligence on banks will enable ADB to identify and \ncharacterize any gaps in the financial and technical capacity of individual banks that would inhibit \nthe provision and/or increase of trade finance credit lines.4 DMC banks are targeted based on a \nmarket survey conducted by the TFP. If there is market demand for TFP guarantees on a \nparticular DMC bank, the bank will be targeted for due diligence and inclusion into the program.5 \nThe due diligence results will be included in credit applications to establish or maintain TFP credit \nlines for participating banks.  \n \n6.  Output 2:  In-country seminars and trainings conducted. The TFP provides post-due \ndiligence feedback to DMC banks to identify weaknesses and improvement benchmarks. This \ncapacity development will help strengthen DMC banks and improve their ability to attract credit \nlines to support trade from international financial institutions. This will ultimately benefit importers \nand exporters by increasing their opportunities to access trade finance, allowing them to expand \ntheir business operations, and thereby create jobs and reduce poverty. \n \n7.  Information regarding the adequacy of the financial and technical capacity of individual \nbanks will be confidentially conveyed to those banks. More general information about trade \nfinance operations will be disseminated through in-country seminars to which DMC banks, \nexporters,  government officials,  and  international  banks  may  be  invited.  The  seminars  are \nexpected to cover (i) key concepts and processes in trade finance, (ii) essential elements in \ndeveloping and marketing trade finance products and services, (iii) payment and risk categories, \n(iv)  risk  analysis  of  trade  finance  products,  (v)  fundamentals  of  documentary  credits,  (vi) \nenvironment and safeguards guidelines as applied to TFP transactions, and (vii) de-risking and \nanti-money laundering compliance methods. The TA will also be used to fund regional seminars \nand other TFP training events, as well as an annual networking event, which will bring together \ninternational and local DMC banks and seek to increase private sector engagement with DMCs. \n \n8.  Activities will include the following: \n \n(i)  work with individual banks to acquire financial data; \n(ii)  analyze the financial information through financial, ratio, gap, and other analyses; \n(iii)  conduct onsite due diligence on banks; \n(iv)  assess the trade finance operations capacity of selected banks and make \nrecommendations for improvement; \n(v)  draft credit applications, risk ratings, and financial due diligence reports; \n(vi)  conduct integrity due diligence and reviews, including monitoring and following \nup on recommendations for improvement; \n(vii)  conduct due diligence and financial assessments on TFP banks with a view to \nexpanding and leveraging the TFP to include additional ADB financial products; \n(viii)  conduct a banking sector analysis for each DMC; \n(ix)  conduct signing ceremonies with new partner banks;  \n(x)  deliver trade finance training;  \n(xi)  support initiatives related to knowledge- sharing important to closing trade \nfinance gaps; and \n(xii)  conduct knowledge-sharing, and partnership-development activities (including \ntraining seminars for DMC banks and regional training and/or networking events). \n \n \n4  The TA will coordinate with the TFP to target banks where there is market demand for capacity development. \n5  Notwithstanding current market demand, the TFP will likewise support further expansion to Group A countries \nincluding banks in Myanmar and the Pacific region (e.g., Samoa, Vanuatu, and possibly the Marshall Islands). \n ", "3 \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $3,200,000, of which $1,000,000 will be funded by \nTASF-6 and $2,200,000 will be funded by TASF-Others. The funds will cover remuneration, travel, \nand per diem for international consultants, conference related expenditures, and miscellaneous \nexpenses. \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n10.  ADB will administer the subproject. PSOD will select, supervise and evaluate consultants \nas well as resource persons that will be engaged for TFP seminars and trainings. \n \nTable 1: Subproject Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  July 2019\u2013June 2020 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nImplementing agencies  Asian Development Bank \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nContract extension of  Firm:  due diligence and  ADB, Subproject 2  \nwinning firm engaged via  financial analysis experts; \nQuality and cost-based  resource persons \nselection under \nSubproject 1; resource \nperson selection  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n11.
