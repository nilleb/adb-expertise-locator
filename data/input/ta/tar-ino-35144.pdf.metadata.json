During the 2002 country programming exercise of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nthe Government of Indonesia requested ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) to prepare a \nproject for the reform of state audit institutions. It was confirmed that for sustainability of poverty \nreduction efficient public expenditure management is key and the reform of state audit would \naddress this. Accordingly a project preparatory TA was programmed for 2003. ADB fielded the \nTA  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  January  2003  and  reached  broad  understanding  with  the \nGovernment  on  the  goal,  purpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements,  and  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference  of  the  TA.1  The  preliminary  project \nframework is given in Appendix 1, and a summary initial social and poverty assessment in \nAppendix 2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Sound and effective auditing arrangements in the public sector are the cornerstone for \nensuring good governance, accountability, and transparency.  Public auditing arrangements \nneed both an external audit function (reporting to the legislature) and an internal audit function \n(reporting  to  the  executive).  These  are  complementary  activities.  External  audit  is  the \nmechanism outside of the executive of ensuring full accountability of the executive to the public, \nwhereas internal audit is performed internally by the executive as a self administered check to \nensure  compliance  of  the  executive  with  audit  requirements.  In  Indonesia,  following \ndecentralization, both audit functions, to various degrees, are carried out at the central and \nregional  government  level.2  Badan  Pemeriska  Keuangan  (BPK),  as  the  supreme  audit \ninstitution, has the mandate for external audit both at the central government level reporting to \nthe People\u2019s Consultative Assembly and at regional government level reporting to the regional \nparliaments. As regards internal audit at the central government level, Badan Pengawasan \nKeuangan  dan  Pembangunan  (BPKP)  reports  to  the  President  and  at  ministerial  level  an \ninspector general (IG) reports to each minister. At the regional government level, regional \ninternal audit agencies (BAWASDAs) report to the regional governments.  \n \n3.  For Indonesia, the move from a centralized authoritarian government to a decentralized \ndemocracy has posed a number of challenges and the country is very much in a transition \nphase. Under laws 22 and 25 of 1999, which underpin the Indonesian decentralization, all \nfunctions other than foreign policy, defense, security, judiciary, monetary and fiscal matters, and \nreligious affairs, are being devolved to regional governments.3 This has been accompanied by \nthe transfer of over 2 million central Government staff to local governments and the transfer of \ncentral Government revenues, for fiscal year 2003, estimated to be $13 billion. However the \ndevolution of auditing functions commensurate to the process of decentralization has not been \neffected due to unsettled institutional arrangements and capacity problems. \n \n4.  BPK is the supreme audit institution and the external auditor of Government, and is \nrecognized  as  such  by  international  professional  organizations.4  The  1945  Constitution \nestablished  BPK,  and  its  current  structure  is  regulated  by  Law  5/1973.  Following \ndecentralization and the recent constitutional amendments, BPK has been given the mandate to \nexpand  its  work  in  the  regions.  When  auditing  regional  governments,  BPK  reports  to  the \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on January 2003 and was programmed for \n2003 in the Country Strategy and Program for Indonesia 2003-2005. \n2 Regional Government refers to both provincial (self-) governments (propinsi) and district (self-) governments, which \nare either regencies (kabupaten) or cities (kota). \n3 Law 22/1999 on Regional Government and Law25/1999 on Fiscal Balance between the Center and Regions.  \n4 The International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) and Asian Organization of Supreme Audit \nInstitutions (ASOSAI) recognize BPK.  \n   \n ", "    2 \nregional  parliaments.  BPK\u2019s  mandate  now  includes  the  audit  of  over  8,000  agencies, \ndepartments, regions, state and region-owned enterprises, and hospitals in the public sector. \nAlthough BPK\u2019s role is firmly established in the constitution it is unable to fulfill its constitutional \nmandate  of  external  audit  performance  effectively  due  to  the  shortage  of  budgetary  and \nappropriate level of human resources. Further, at an operational level, clarification is required of \nBPK\u2019s  constitutional  role;  legal  status;  powers,  responsibilities,  duties,  qualifications,  and \nindependence of its Board members; and relationship to Parliament. There are issues relating to \nits funding arrangements, accountability, and the transparency of its own operations. In addition, \nthe relationship with BPKP has not been clarified. \n \n5.  BPKP was established as the Government\u2019s central internal audit agency by presidential \ndecree in 1983. BPKP reports formally to the President, but for administrative purposes reports \nto the State Ministry for Administrative Reform (MenPAN). BPKP is internal to the executive, but \noutside of any particular ministry, and its role is sometimes misconstrued as that of an external \nauditor.  BPKP\u2019s role is, at present, the subject of debate.  With the emphasis on strengthening \nthe audit function of the IGs and the increasing autonomy of regional governments, whose \nexecutives are supported by their BAWASDAs, BPKP\u2019s role requires redefinition. Moreover, the \ncurrent mandate of BPKP could be seen to overlap with the mandate of the IGs, BAWASDAS, \nand  also  with  that  of  the  external  audit  institution  BPK.  Various  executive  decrees  and \ngovernment regulations, often with conflicting objectives, have contributed to the confusion.  \nThe discussions of how to resolve this issue have been colored by institutional uncertainty as \neach audit institution tries to cement its role in a decentralized environment. This highlights the \nneed  to  delineate  internal  and  external  audit  activities  and  to  clarify  the  mandates  of  the \norganizations carrying out those activities. BPKP is by far the best funded and equipped of all \nthe audit institutions in Indonesia, and has about 8,000 staff in 25 provincial offices, compared \nto BPK\u2019s 3500 staff in 7 regions. Any change in role for any institution will have to deal with \nsignificant human resource issues. \n \n6.  The IGs function with a total of about 7000 operational and support staff. With the \ndecentralization of many ministries the IGs are considered overstaffed as much of their auditing \nmandate at the regional level has been taken over by BAWASDAs. At the same time, a number \nof issues have been raised with respect to the quality of the audits, the ability of the IGs to carry \nout  financial  and  operational  audits,  the  professional  competence  of  the  auditors,  their \nprofessionalism, and their funding. \n \n7.  The BAWASDAs were formed as part of the implementation of laws 22 and 25, and \nwere  strengthened  with  the  subsequent  Government  regulation  105/2000  on  Financial \nManagement and Accountability in Regions. The latter now calls for the appointment of an \ninternal  auditor  who  reports  to  the  head  of  the  regional  government.  However,  resource \nconstraints  are  inhibiting  the  successful  operation  of  the  BAWASDAs,  with  the  units  not \nadequately  staffed  with  trained  professional  internal  auditors.  In  addition  there  is  little \nconsistency  in  how  the  BAWASDAs  conduct  their  operations.  Most  of  the  staff  possess \neducational backgrounds other than in accounting or auditing and turnover of qualified staff is \nhigh. In the past, owing to the lack of resources, the BAWASDAs often sought the assistance of \nBPKP. However, regional governments are now keen to stress their autonomy, and often prefer \nthat regional entities not get audited rather than request help from BPKP. Given the need to \nensure that the decentralization process is supported by sound financial management, the \nstrengthening of the BAWASDAs is seen as a critical imperative. \n \n8.  The shared view of stakeholders, including Ministry of Finance (MOF), National Planning \nAgency  (BAPPENAS),  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA),  Ministry  of  National  Education \n(MONE),  MenPAN,  BPKP,  representatives  of  IGs,  BAWASDAs,  experts  from  Indonesian \n \n ", "    3 \nuniversities such as the University of Gajah Madah and the University of Indonesia, BPK, the \nJakarta  offices  of  the  World  Bank,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC), \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  and  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID is that while there is no dearth of auditors, the audit function \nis neither coordinated nor cost effective.  \n \n9.  A clear set of issues has emerged: (i) a lack of consensus within the government on the \noverall institutional arrangement, in particular on the mandates and budgetary allocations for \neach institution; (ii) an unclear legal framework coupled with the plethora of government decrees \nthat  have  resulted  in  overlapping  functions;  (iii)  inadequate  human  resource  capability \ncompounded  by  structural  civil  service  issues,  particularly  at  the  regional  level;  (iv)  poor \nunderstanding by key decision makers of good audit practices; and (v) external support that has \nbeen intermittent and directed to individual  institutions without the framework of a long-term \nplan.  \n \n10.  Recognizing the importance of strengthening the state audit function, the Government \ninitiated steps to resolve some of these issues by facilitating, through a paper, the submission of \nthree  separate  bills  on  state  finances,  state  treasury  and  state  audit.5  Although  the  state \nfinances law has been enacted recently, the passage of the state treasury law and the state \naudit law are likely to take some time. In particular the draft state audit law was not based on \nnecessary consultative processes, and there is a lack of independent analyses for decision \nmakers to facilitate its acceptance by Parliament. The Government has indicated that key \nstakeholders, including BPK, the key agency to be affected by the new state audit law have \nraised issues with the draft law and it may have to be reformulated. The proposed medium-term \nnational development plan (PROPENAS) for 2005-2009 specifically identifies the state audit \nfunction as one of its key focus areas for the reform of the state apparatus, and the Government \nfeels strongly that external technical support is needed in appropriately analyzing the issues as \ninput into the PROPENAS.  \n \n11.  Although good governance in Indonesia has been a key issue for the funding community \nfor some years now, the public audit function has not been a priority for assistance.6 The need \nfor strong fiduciary arrangements has been stressed in the joint ADB-World Bank 2001 Country \nFinancial Accountability Assessment, and the ADB country governance assessment carried out \nin preparation of the Country Strategy and Program for Indonesia 2003-2005.  \n \n12.   Capacity-building activities for the audit function have been focused on institutions. \nADB\u2019s support has primarily been with BPKP (about $12 million) and the IG in the Ministry of \nSettlements and Regional Infrastructure (MSRI).7 The World Bank is currently assisting BPK \nthrough its 1997 BPK Modernization Project (about $15.5 million). AusAID is currently assisting \nBPK (about $1.5 million) for capacity building to audit military expenditure and special purpose \ninvestigative  audits.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  is \ncurrently implementing a project with the IG in the MOF, with the focus on the customs and \ntaxation divisions. At the regional level, there has been a concerted effort to support the national \n                                                 \n5 Ministry of Finance 2002 Reform of Public Financial Management System in Indonesia; Principles and Strategy, \nJakarta. \n6 The Consultative Group for Indonesia (CGI), the principal forum for coordination of external funding agencies, puts \na strong emphasis on good governance as necessary to support development. \n7 ADB 1998 1620-INO Financial Governance Reforms: Capacity Building for Financial Governance. The loan has \nsubprojects with different agencies and the component relating to BPKP is ongoing. The loan is due to close on 30 \nSeptember 2003. While the role of BPKP in the future auditing structure was uncertain when this TA loan was \ndesigned, the establishment of the capacity in core audit functions was considered necessary and useful as the \ndeveloped core competencies are fungible. ADB 2002 3842-INO Support to Strengthen the Capacity of MSRI to \nCombat Fraud and Corruption aims at improving auditing procedures, skills and techniques within the MSRI IG.  \n \n ", "    4 \nframework  for  decentralization.8  In  particular  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Capacity  Building  for \nDecentralization loan supports local Government initiatives in a range of areas.9 While the \nspecific institution-based capacity-building efforts have been useful, there is also an unmet need \nto establish a clear vision for the future institutional setup of Indonesia\u2019s audit function. The \nproposed TA will address this need and complement the ongoing efforts of all concerned \nagencies. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The TA will help the Government formulate and design a project to support state audit \nreform. The TA will aim to build strong and effective audit institutions in the public sector by (i) \ndeveloping  a  road  map  that  reflects  a  shared  understanding  among  stakeholders  of  a \ncomprehensive  and  long-term  perspective  for  audit  institutions,  (ii)  formulating  institutional \ndevelopment plans for internal and external audit institutions, and (iii) identifying areas for \nexternal financing. The TA will specify key policy actions needed to effect legal and institutional \nchange. The TA will also incorporate internationally recognized auditing standards and good \npractices in Indonesia\u2019s public sector audit systems and procedures taking into account the \nIndonesian experience. Underpinning the road map will be four basic considerations, the need \nto (i) make a clear distinction between internal and external audit functions, (ii) respect the \ndecentralised environment in Indonesia, (iii) avoid duplication and overlap of mandates, and (iv) \nachieve cost efficiency. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will have two phases. Phase 1 will focus on helping the development of a \nframework for state audit reform, based on careful sector analysis and an extensive consultative \nprocess, to ensure acceptance of the framework by all stakeholders. Under this phase, the TA \nwill (i) carry out a comprehensive sector analysis; (ii) support consultation with stakeholders; (iii) \nmake  key  stakeholders  aware  of  the  best  international  practices  in  public  sector  auditing \narrangements and practices; (iv) develop alternate scenarios with proposed policy implications \nfor  the  institutional  arrangement  of  auditing  institutions,  and  for  the  proposed  legislative \nframework; (v) seek stakeholder consensus on a selected scenario; and  (vi) identify suitable \nareas of possible ADB financial and further TA support for state audit reform. Given various \nstakeholders in the sector and competing institutional demands, a major requirement will be to \ninvolve all the stakeholders in the discussions during TA implementation. Any conclusions \nreached must then be seen by decision-makers to have broad-based support. Objectivity and \nthe  link  to  best  international  practice  will  be  achieved  by  involving  suitable  international \nconsultants. Following a tripartite meeting, phase 2 will be undertaken. This phase will develop \nthe  project  design  for  further  assistance  including  the  project  scope  and  components, \nimplementation arrangements, cost estimates, and a financing plan.  \n \n                                                 \n8 The Government undertook a participatory needs assessment in 1999-2000, supported by funding agencies in \npreparation for the 2001 decentralization. It resulted in the National Framework for action and the external support in \ncapacity building for local governance being finalized. ADB support in this field includes ADB 2000 TA 3394-INO: \nPublic Expenditure Management and the Implications of Decentralization, for $225,000, ADB 2000 TA 3178-INO \nunder the Community and Local Government Support Program (CLGSSP); ADB 2000 TA 3518-INO: Financial \nManagement Systems, for $1,100,000, and ADB 2001 TA 3764-INO: Supporting Country Financial Accountability, \nfor $300,000, \n9 ADB 2002 Loan1964-INO: Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization for $42,000,000.  \n \n ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $884,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange component of $550,000 and local currency component of $334,000 equivalent. ADB \nwill provide $700,000 equivalent to finance the total foreign exchange cost and a portion of the \nlocal currency costs amounting to $150,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nfrom  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan. The Government will \nprovide the remaining $184,000 equivalent in kind to cover the costs of office accommodation, \ncounterpart staff and support services relating to TA implementation. The Government has been \ninformed that ADB\u2019s approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will require a total of about 28 person-months of consulting services, including \nabout 12 person-months of international and 16 person-months of domestic consultants. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  using  the  quality  and  cost  based  selection  (QCBS)  method,  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The simplified \ntechnical proposal format will be used. An outline terms of reference of the consultants is in \nAppendix 4. \n \n17.  BAPPENAS will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  A steering committee chaired by \nBAPPENAS  and  comprising  senior  BAPPENAS,  BPK,  BPKP,  MenPAN,  MOF,  and  MOHA \nofficials will be established to provide guidance and oversee the TA implementation. A working \ngroup chaired by BAPPENAS, and comprising representatives from BAPPENAS, BPK, BPKP, \nMenPAN,  MOF,  MOHA,  and  other  nominated  individuals  from  regional  governments,  non-\ngovernment organisations and universities will provide counterpart support to the consultants. \nThe chair of the working group will be the secretary to the steering committee. The working \ngroup will work closely with the consultant team, and ensure that the consultants are provided \nwith all necessary documents and data. The steering committee will meet monthly and the \nworking group weekly. BAPPENAS will fund the counterpart activities from its budget. Office \nequipment for the TA project will be procured by ADB, and will be transferred to the Government \non completion of the TA. During TA implementation, several workshops and seminars will be \norganised to help the process of consensus building. To provide inputs to such workshops and \nseminars, the TA will also support a study tour to be conducted by Government officials on best \ninternational practices. \n \n18.  The consultants will be fielded at the end of August 2003 for a 6 month period ending \nFebruary 2004. They will submit an inception, an interim, a draft final, and a final report. \nTripartite  meetings  involving  ADB,  the  Government,  and  the  consultants  will  discuss  the \nfindings.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for preparing the Support to State Audit Reform Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  6 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign Summary  Indicators & Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Key Assumptions & Risks \nGoal       \nGood governance.
