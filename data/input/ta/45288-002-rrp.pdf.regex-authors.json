THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based  loan  to  India for the  Punjab  Development  Finance  Program. The report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting the Punjab Development Finance \nProgram, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The program seeks to facilitate implementation of a comprehensive fiscal consolidation \nprogram in Punjab. This will generate fiscal savings and make better use of scarce budgetary \nresources, and thereby help with socioeconomic development of the state.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Current economic status. Punjab is primarily an agrarian economy with a population of \n28 million. It has been instrumental in ensuring national food security since the 1960s following \nthe  advent  of  the  green  revolution.  The  state  government  traditionally  provides  subsidies, \nincluding  free  power  to  farmers  to  promote  agriculture,  which  is  constrained  by  declining \nproductivity,  soil  degradation,  and  water  depletion.3 This  has  many  ramifications.  Punjab\u2019s \nranking in per capita income in India declined from fourth in FY2004 to seventh in FY2012. \nGross state domestic product (GSDP) growth was 6% during FY2002\u2013FY2006 compared with \n7.6% for the country, and 6.5% during FY2007\u2013FY2012 compared with 7.5% for the country. \n \n4.  Large committed expenditures. Despite relatively robust own-tax effort with an own-\ntax to GSDP ratio of 8.3% in FY2012 (Table 1), the deteriorating fiscal situation has placed \nadded pressures on public resources, constraining capital investment and leading to low growth \nand poor delivery of public goods and services in the state.4 The committed expenditures of the \nstate government (salaries, pensions, interest payments, and subsidies) have almost exhausted \nthe total revenue receipts in recent years, requiring the state to undertake even larger borrowing \nto finance these expenditures in addition to capital expenditure, thereby trapping the state in a \nvicious cycle of mounting current account (revenue) and fiscal deficits.5 The weak financial \nperformance  of public sector  enterprises,  including the  newly  created  Punjab  State  Power \nCorporation  Limited  (PSPCL)  and  Punjab  State  Transmission  Corporation  Limited,  has \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance, approved by the director \ngeneral of the South Asia Department on 22 November 2012 for an amount not exceeding the equivalent of \n$220,000, as a subproject under the cluster TA (ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance Cluster to India for Advanced \nProject Preparedness for Poverty Reduction. Manila [C-TA 0003-IND, financed by the Government of the United \nKingdom through the Department for International Development]). \n3   The primary sector contributed more than 57% to GSDP in FY1970, followed by the tertiary sector (27%) and the \nsecondary sector (16%), but the contribution to GSDP originating from the primary sector declined to nearly 47% in \nFY1990 and 21.8% in FY2012. \n4   The Government of Punjab (GOP) fails to provide matching grants to several centrally sponsored schemes in such \nareas as rural housing and rural livelihood. Consequently, the national government does not transfer all the project \nfunds originally approved. \n5   The debt stock\u2013GSDP ratio for FY2012 will be much higher than 31.7% if off-budget items and contingent liabilities \nare included. Moreover, Punjab has accessed ways and means advances from the Reserve Bank of India for \nhighest number of days across Indian states since FY2010.  \n ", "2  \nexacerbated the growing fiscal imbalances and mounting public debt.6 \n \nTable 1: Key Fiscal Indicators across Selected States in India (FY2012) \n(all variables are percentage of gross state domestic product) \n    GCS    Uttar   \nItem  Punjab  Average  Haryana  Pradesh  Best Performing \nOwn tax   8.3  7.7  6.9  7.9  10.2 (Karnataka) \nRevenue deficit  1.6  0.0  0.9  (0.7)  (2.6) (Jharkhand) \nFiscal deficit  3.2  2.6  2.3  2.8  1.1 (Odisha) \nDebt  31.7  24.4  18.6  33.7  12.5 (Chattisgarh) \nCapital outlay  1.5  2.4  1.3  3.4  4.6  (Bihar) \n(  ) = revenue surplus, GCS = general category states. \nNote: Punjab is a general category state. States are divided into general category and special \ncategory based on geographic terrain and inherent infrastructure difficulties. Revised estimates \nfor fiscal variables have been used to facilitate comparisons across states. However, actuals \nfor Punjab for FY2012 are available. Actual figures, as a percentage of gross state domestic \nproduct, are own-tax revenue (7.9), revenue deficit (2.6), and fiscal deficit (3.3). \nSource: Reserve Bank of India report on state finances, a study of state budgets, 2013\u20132014. \n \n5.  Limited fiscal flexibility. Punjab\u2019s fragile fiscal situation could also be attributed to ad \nhoc  expenditure  planning  and  management  with  untargeted  transfer  payment  and  subsidy \nschemes. Moreover, the lack of an evaluation and monitoring system causes inordinate delays \nin project execution leading to cost escalation, and projects quite often fail to deliver desired \noutcomes. More importantly, the untargeted power subsidy and, in particular, free power to \nfarmers, has brought both the state exchequer and the power sector to the brink of financial \ncollapse.7 The share of the subsidy in total revenue (current) expenditure was 12.8% (1.8% of \nGSDP) in FY2012.8 This has many implications. First, PSPCL is unable to modernize power \ninfrastructure due to the lack of borrowing opportunities from banks and financial institutions.9 \nSecond, the deteriorating fiscal situation of the Government of Punjab (GOP) has had negative \nconsequences  for  its  development  agenda.  In  particular,  the  increase  in  nondiscretionary \ncommitted expenditure has limited the government\u2019s ability to make effective use of public \nspending to meet its policy priorities. More directly, this has resulted in a large opportunity cost \nas a disproportionate share of the fiscal adjustment fell on capital spending. Capital outlay \n(capital investment) as a percentage of GSDP remains lower than the general category state \naverage (Table 1). \n \n6.  Unsustainable  development  paradigm  due  to  power  subsidies.  Despite  GOP\u2019s \nefforts to reduce input cost through various subsidies including free power to farmers, Punjab\u2019s \nagriculture is currently facing serious challenges. Moreover, power subsidies have led to an \nunsustainable development paradigm without matching growth in food-grain yields. Indeed, high \n                                                \n6   Power reforms\u2014other than notional unbundling of the Punjab State Electricity Board\u2014need to be expedited to \nmeet the power needs of all sectors as well as household consumption requirements. \n7  In several instances, the state exchequer has been unable to make cash transfers to the electricity boards \nbecause of hard budget constraints. Only notional book adjustments are made. This, however, aggravates the \nproblems of the electricity boards because they have to pay for power purchases. R. Kaur and M. Sharma. 2012. \nAgricultural Subsidies in India: Case Study of Electricity Subsidy in Punjab State. International Journal of Scientific \nand Research Publication. 2 (10). \n8   Moreover, at an average of 1.6% of GSDP during FY2007\u2013FY2012,  power subsidies account for a disproportional \namount of the total implicit subsidies. Sector Assessment: Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  This has other ramifications. For example, public sector banks are currently struggling with nonperforming assets \noriginating from bad loans to the state electricity boards and state power corporations. Consequently, public sector \nbanks are reluctant to lend to these electricity boards and/or corporations. \n ", "  3\npower subsidies have led to overconsumption of water, resulting in a reduction of underground \nwater reserves as the water table declines, necessitating the use of higher capacity pump sets, \nwhich, in turn, consume more power and result in higher power subsidies.10  \n \n7.  Major policy challenges. Punjab is caught in two vicious cycles of power subsidies and \ndebt\u2013deficit  dynamics,  reinforcing  each  other,  and  undermining  fiscal  and  environmental \nsustainability. \n \n \n \n8.  Creating fiscal space. The logic of the program hinges on the link between creating \nfiscal space as a means to augment and sustain capital investment in the state and laying the \ngroundwork for improvements in investment in economic and social infrastructure. However, this \nwill require initiating simultaneous and incremental reforms in state finances and free power \nsupply to agriculture.11  \n \n9.  The program is consistent with the country partnership strategy (2013\u20132017) for India, \nwhich states that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will continue to provide assistance for \nfiscal consolidation in the states to facilitate reorientation of public expenditure in favor of capital \ninvestment.12 13 \n \n10.  Based on a comprehensive diagnostic study (footnote 2), the program specifies three \nareas for support in setting state finances on a path consistent with a revised and sustainable \n                                                \n10  Within the state, 79% of the groundwater assessment divisions (blocks) are now considered overexploited and \ncritical with extraction exceeding supply. From 1982 to 1987, the water table in Central Punjab fell at an average of \n18 centimeters per year. That rate of decline accelerated to 42 centimeters/year during 1997\u20132002, and to a \nstaggering 75 centimeters during 2002\u20132006. Water tables are now receding in about 90% of the state, with \nCentral Punjab most severely affected (http://water.columbia.edu/research-projects/india/punjab-india/). Moreover, \nreduced surface water availability during the summer months due to climate change will have a serious impact on \nagriculture. Adequate groundwater can be of great help in mitigating this effect (Asian Development Bank. 2012. \nEconomics of Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions in South Asia. Manila). Thus, the program will facilitate \nclimate change mitigation. \n11  Direct and indirect subsidies and underpriced tariffs are important policy barriers for promoting renewable energy-\nbased power (Asian Development Bank. 2012. Economics of Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions in South Asia. \nManila). \n12  ADB. 2013. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2013\u20132017. Manila. \n13 The program is also consistent with ADB\u2019s assistance program for the energy sector. \n ", "4  \nmedium-term fiscal framework (MTFF). Capacity building and institutional strengthening under \nthe attached TA will be critical to eliminating the constraints of the state. Sound business \nprocesses cannot be implemented and maintained unless capacity development is an integral \npart of new initiatives. The program areas include the following: \n(i)  Fiscal  management.  Rationalization  of  public  expenditure  to  better  support \ngrowth and human development essentially improves the allocative efficiency of \nscarce public resources. Medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) could \nplay an important role in strengthening budget and expenditure management \nthrough better utilization of fiscal resources, in line with priorities of GOP. Thus, \nMTEFs for  the  line  departments,  combined  with  a  top\u2013down  MTFF, are the \nprerequisites  for  effectively  rationalizing  public  expenditure.  However,  an \neffective MTEF requires both a long-term sector strategy and a system of project \nappraisal  and  evaluation.  MTEFs  cannot  be  implemented  rigorously  unless \nsupported by these two tools.  \n(ii)  Expenditure  rationalization  focusing  on  power  subsidy.  Given  political \nsensitivities, rationalization of the agriculture power subsidy and improvement of \nthe  targeting  of  power  subsidies  need  to  be  implemented  in  a  phased  and \nincremental manner. This requires changing behavior by introducing demand \nmanagement incentives supported by a public awareness campaign. Free power \nto farmers will continue. However, this will be capped based on normative power \nsupply requirements.14 Demand-side measures will provide incentives to farmers \nto  contain  power  consumption  below  the  normative  requirements.  The  crop-\nspecific and region-specific thresholds for power consumption in agriculture will \nbe worked out during program implementation and supported by the TA. The \nrelevant policy action could be introduced by the second tranche of the program. \nThe GOP has prepared a strategy to improve the targeting of power subsidies, \nwhich includes measures to encourage reducing power consumption to below \nthe  normative  requirements.  Finally,  supply-side  measures  are  important  to \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  the  power  supply  through  improved  technical \nperformance of PSPCL. This, in turn, will improve the finances of PSPCL, and \nthe general state budget. \n(iii)  Revenue reforms. One important prerequisite of fiscal consolidation is that state \nfinances  are  augmented,  to  the  extent  possible,  by  own-revenue  sources. \nReforming the revenue streams is critical for augmenting own-revenue sources. \nThe program focuses on improving state revenue efforts by rationalizing tax rates \nand thresholds of certain taxes, and introducing a new tax. These reforms will \nenable GOP to mobilize more own-tax revenue from the revenue base. \n \n11.  Lessons. Punjab is one of the three states in India currently in an extremely poor fiscal \nsituation and, therefore, requires immediate assistance for fiscal consolidation. In October 2012, \nthe ADB Board of Directors approved a similar loan for the state of West Bengal.15 During \nprocessing, the program drew on lessons from  all  previous  loans,  including  the  West Bengal  \n \n                                                \n14 Normative power requirements imply maximum quantum of free power allowed for a consumer category. It will be \nestablished on the basis of a detailed study of geographical region, rainfall, cropping pattern, and water table \ndepths. \n15 ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-based Loan \nand Technical Assistance Grant to India for the West Bengal Development Finance Program. Manila (Loan 2926\u2013\nIND, approved on 30 October). \n ", "  5\nloan. This is a continuous process to improve the program design for greater aid effectiveness.16 \nThree critical lessons are that (i) state government ownership to implement sensitive reforms is \nextremely critical, (ii) capacity development support is essential during implementation, and  \n(iii) active stakeholder consultation including a communication strategy can mitigate the risk of \nnonparticipation  by  stakeholders  and  address  vested  interests  that  may  risk  the  reform \nmomentum. For this program, stakeholder consultations with industries, academics, and the \nassociation of industries have been carried out and will continue throughout implementation. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be improved capital investment in the state. The outcome will be a larger \nand more sustainable fiscal space in the state government. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  ADB and the GOP reached an agreement on the broad areas of ADB support under the \nfast-disbursing policy reform program: \n(i)  Improved  capacity  for  fiscal  management.  Reform  measures  will  include  \n(a) designing fiscal responsibility and budget management rules; (b) establishing \na fiscal policy and management unit (FPMU) in the state Finance Department to \ncarry out project appraisal, monitoring, and evaluation to improve allocation of \npublic expenditures based on certain principles; (c) preparing long-term sector \nstrategies in selected departments along with road maps for achievement of \ngoals; and (d) preparing a departmental rolling MTEF for selected departments. \nThe  program  will  strengthen  the  state\u2019s  cash  management  system  to  ease \nborrowing requirements and enhance institutional capacity to actively manage \nstate debt. All of these measures will serve to generate fiscal savings, which in \nturn will support gradual increases in the capital outlay to GSDP ratio proposed \nunder the program. \n(ii)  Rationalized  expenditure  focusing  on  power  subsidies.  Power  subsidy \nrationalization  (or  improved  targeting  of  power  subsidies)  will  include  \n(a)  introducing  normative  free  power  requirements  for  agriculture  and \nincentivizing efficient uses of power,17 (b) segregating agriculture feeder lines \nand  using the  agriculture feeder  data for  subsidy  calculation,  (c)  introducing \n100%  feeder  metering,  (d)  introducing  distribution  meters,  (e)  introducing  a \nsystem of power demand forecasting and management, and (f) implementing a \ndebt restructuring plan for PSPCL. \n(iii)  Improved  revenue  efforts.  Revenue  efforts  will  be  strengthened  by  \n(a) introducing a profession tax, (b) reducing the threshold for tax deducted at the \nsource  on  works  contracts,  (c)  increasing  the  tax  rate  on  turnover  to  a \ncomparable level of other states, and (d) digitizing land records.18 \n \n14.  There are 22 policy actions proposed in the program distributed over three tranches (8 \n                                                \n16 For example: (i) ADB. 2007.

Without  high  growth,  especially \nmanufacturing growth, the commercial state tax base will not grow commensurately with the \ncapital investment needs of the state. Thus, the program\u2019s focus on higher capital investment \nwill have an indirect impact on revenue mobilization and fiscal space creation, in addition to the \ndirect impact channeled through the program outputs. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n15.  Keeping  the  fiscal  deficit  at  a  sustainable  level  will  be  difficult  for  GOP  unless  it \ncontinues to  reduce  development  expenditure,  despite the  negative  impact  on growth  and \ndevelopment. Thus, the main focus of the program is to help the state stabilize its finances, \nwhich in turn will help it augment and sustain development financing. \n \n16.  The program will help the state to launch the necessary reforms for a balanced and \nsustainable fiscal trajectory over the medium-term, and to meet its development financing needs \n(capital investment). It will contribute to repositioning and strengthening the budget as the main \ntool for prioritizing the development objectives. Capital outlay as a percentage of GSDP is \nexpected to rise from less than 1% in FY2012 to 2.4% by FY2016 under the program. The \nreforms under the program will generate fiscal savings equivalent of $766 million over 5 years \n(FY2014\u2013FY2018), and $180 million during FY2014\u2013FY2016, and thereby contribute to the twin \ngoals of sustainability of state finances and sustainable increase in development spending. \nHowever, a development financing gap (additional capital outlay in the reform scenario net of \nnew fiscal space created under the program) of approximately $252 million during FY2014\u2013\nFY2016 will remain. ADB funds will help cover this gap.19 \n \n17.  Based on (i) the request of the Government of India and (ii) the development financing \nrequirements of the policy reform program, ADB will provide a policy-based loan of $200 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. A three-tranche \npolicy framework, consistent with the timings of various reforms, is envisaged. The distribution \nof the tranches will be $50 million, $50 million, and $100 million, with the first tranche to be \ndisbursed upon loan effectiveness. The second tranche will be disbursed approximately 18 \nmonths after loan effectiveness, and the third tranche will be disbursed approximately 7 months \nafter the second tranche disbursement. The government will relend the local currency generated \nfrom the proceeds of the total loan amount in accordance with its arrangements for the transfer \nof external assistance to GOP. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The  Finance  Department  of  GOP  will  be  the  executing  agency;  the  department\u2019s \nsecretary  will  be  the  focal  point  for  matters  pertaining  to  the  program.  An  FPMU  will  be \n                                                \n19 A detailed simulation exercise of the state budget is presented in the Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2) under alternative scenarios. Fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP is expected to \ndecline post FY2014 in the baseline scenario. The rate of decline in the fiscal deficit can be further enhanced if the \ncapital investment (capital outlay) is restricted to the baseline level of 2% (Table 2). However, this will delay much \nnecessary growth and development financing in Punjab. \n ", "  7\nestablished with representatives from relevant government departments. \n \n19.  The FPMU, which will help line departments implement the program, will be headed by a \nsenior government official. The FPMU will be responsible for (i) coordinating and monitoring the \nprogram, including the policy actions; (ii) preparing and submitting all required reports to the \nhigher authorities in GOP and ADB; (iii) submitting quarterly progress reports to ADB; and \n(iv) helping implement the attached TA. \n \n20.  The proposed program will be implemented over a period of 30 months. Procurement, \nadvance contracting, and retroactive financing are not expected. The loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from \ntime to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. ADB \nwill monitor program implementation through periodic progress reports and will field regular \nmissions to confirm the fulfillment of policy actions for tranche releases. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n21.  The TA will strengthen the key institutions responsible for implementing the reforms to \nimprove fiscal management performance in the state. The TA has seven components: \n(i)  Power  subsidy  targeting.  Help  implement  the  subsidy  rationalization  plan, \nincluding (a) carrying out technical analysis and surveys to determine normative \npower  consumption  for  agriculture,  and  (b)  conducting  a  public  awareness \ncampaign. \n(ii)  Revenue  administration.  Implement  the  profession  tax,  an  information \ntechnology application for improving taxpayer services, and revenue forecasting \ntechniques. \n(iii)  Project  appraisal  and  monitoring. Help establish an FPMU in the Finance \nDepartment to provide rigorous medium-term fiscal programming and appraisal \nand evaluation of the state government projects, support the FPMU in designing \nmanuals based on certain principles, and strengthen the state\u2019s internal audit \nsystem. \n(iv)  Medium-term expenditure frameworks. Provide support to line departments, \nas  well  as  to  relevant  Finance  Department  officials,  to  prepare  gender-\ndisaggregated expenditure incidence analyses and, drawing on these analyses, \nprepare relevant MTEFs based on the long-term sector strategies. This support \nfor implementation will include expert advice and training, and assistance with \ndesigning detailed guidelines in various areas. \n(v)  Employee database. Help the executing agency prepare a comprehensive and \nsex-disaggregated  database  for  employees  and  pensioners  of  the  state \ngovernment. \n(vi)  Debt management. In line with the weaknesses identified in debt management \nin  the  state,  build  capacity  for  debt  management,  including  developing \nappropriate cash management strategies. \n(vii)  Internal audit. Provide support to strengthen internal audit in the state. \n \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $510,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). GOP will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation \nand supplies, and other logistical support. \n \n23.  The TA implementation arrangements will be aligned with those for the policy-based \n ", "8  \nloan.  The  FPMU  will  implement  the  TA  components;  the  program  steering  committee  will \nprovide  overall  supervision  and  coordination.  A  total  of  38  person-months  of  national \nconsultancy services will be required intermittently. A consulting firm will be engaged to recruit \nthe consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a standard quality\u2013cost \nratio of 90:10. All consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All disbursements under the TA will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  Information and communication technology-driven initiatives are proposed to improve tax \ncompliance. Introduction of project appraisal techniques and preparation of the MTEFs will \nrequire sound technical knowledge. The conduct of the surveys to determine power usage \nnorms for various crops will require sound technical knowledge about crop production, irrigation \ntechniques, and surveys. Capacity building support under the program will help the relevant \ndepartments to better manage these technical operations. \n \nB.  Economic \n \n25.  The economic analysis indicates that program benefits considerably outweigh the costs. \nThe key direct benefits considered are (i) better targeting of subsidies, (ii) better allocation of \nscarce public resources, (iii) improved public financial management, (iv) improved revenue \nefforts, and (v) reduced debt service burden due to better management of debt and fiscal \nconsolidation. A comparison of the baseline and the pro-growth reform program scenarios \ndriven by higher capital outlay shows that the overall fiscal deficit is expected to be reduced \nafter 5 years despite higher capital outlay (Table 2).20  \n \nTable 2: Baseline and Reform Scenarios \n(% of gross state domestic product) \nItem  FY2014  FY2015  FY2016  FY2017  FY2018 \nBaseline Scenario  \nFiscal deficit  3.1  3.0  2.8  2.7  2.5 \nCapital outlay  2.0  2.0  2.0  2.0  2.0 \nDebt stock  31.7  31.2  30.7  30.1  29.3 \nReform Scenario           \nFiscal deficit  3.0  3.1  3.2  2.9  2.7 \nCapital outlay  2.0  2.2  2.4  2.5  2.5 \nFiscal deficit without \n3.0  2.9  2.8  2.4  2.2 \nadditional capital outlay \nDebt stock  31.6  31.3  31.1  30.6  30.0 \nFY = fiscal year. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n26.  Fiscal space created under the program, resulting from expenditure rationalization and \nimproved revenue efforts, will contribute to this outcome. Moreover, the debt stock\u2013GSDP ratio \n                                                \n20 These projections will be revisited while preparing the MTFF (Policy Action No. 17 under the third tranche) \nfollowing the (i) Fourteenth Finance Commission Awards and (ii) the expected rollout of the goods and services \ntax. \n ", "  9\nwill  decline.21 The  other  important  economic  benefit  of the  program  is  the  promotion  of a \ndevelopment  model  that  facilitates  conservation  of  natural  resources,  such  as  water,  by \ntargeting the power subsidy for agriculture in an efficient manner. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n27.  As  part  of  program  preparation,  a  governance  risk  assessment  was  conducted  in \naccordance  with  the  implementation  guidelines  of  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption  Action  Plan.  The  assessment  was  complemented  by  a  review  of  areas  of \npossible risk and vulnerability in state financial management. The assessment found some \nvulnerable areas that could affect the program. They include risks related to (i) political support \nand ownership of policy reforms by the state government and (ii) institutional dimensions of the \nprogram (e.g., weak capacity in relevant institutions). The financial assessment found several \nareas  of  concern:  (i)  lack  of  appraisal  and  evaluation  of  investment  projects,  (ii)  weak \nimplementation and moderate monitoring protocols, (iii) inadequate internal audits, and (iv) no \nalignment between sector goals and resource allocation.22 Accordingly, a detailed results-based \npublic sector management assessment was carried out, and these risks, especially in the areas \nof  evaluation  and  implementation,  are  being  addressed  through  the  policy  actions  and/or \nthrough the capacity development under the TA. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  The poverty reduction and social impacts of the program are positive. The program\u2019s \nspecial emphasis on enhancing investment in economic and social infrastructure is clearly \ngeared to creating employment opportunities and protecting the poor and other vulnerable \ngroups. Moreover, the program will continue to support free power for families living below the \npoverty line. The health indicators for women and children in the state are weaker than in other \ndeveloped states due to ineffective delivery of public services, especially in rural areas (causing \nlarge rural\u2013urban divides) and lack of adequate budget allocations. This is manifested in many \nways. For example, high incidence of cancer, sharp rural\u2013urban disparities in maternity care, \ninstitutional births, postnatal care, and child immunization in Punjab reflect inadequate health \nservices. Rectifying these problems becomes all the more challenging if the state government is \nunable to invest in a targeted manner.23 As a result, the program will be designed with some \ngender elements to ensure that women receive benefits. The gender-responsive MTEFs, based \non long-term sector goals, are expected to improve targeting of public expenditure, especially \ngender-related allocation of scarce public resources. This will be ensured through MTEF policy \nactions and gender responsive expenditure incidence analysis. The MTEFs will be revised \nannually. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  The three safeguard categories\u2014environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples\u2014are categorized as C. \n \n                                                \n21  Details are provided in the Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22  Results-Based Public Sector Management Assessment Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n23  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of continued government  Continued engagement with GOP to send a consistent \ncommitment to the reforms, and to  message about the need for reforms.
