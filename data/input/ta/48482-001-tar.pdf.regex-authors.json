INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is heavily reliant on external assistance, \nespecially financial support by the United States (US). Despite a recent surge in fishing fee \nrevenues, the country still relies on the US for more than 50% of its fiscal revenues. However, \nthe US support under the Compact agreement will cease at the end of fiscal year (FY) 2023. \nThe 2023 Action Plan, approved in January 2015, is a road map for tackling the fiscal and \neconomic  challenges  up  to  and  beyond  FY2023. 1 The  action  plan  reaffirms  the  critical \nimportance of fiscal consolidation and economic growth. For fiscal consolidation, the action plan \nreiterates the need for tax and tax administration reforms to mobilize revenue and continue \nefforts  toward  expenditure  control  through  better  public  administration  and  financial \nmanagement. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported public administration reforms at the \nnational government level since 2013.2 The government has requested additional technical \nassistance (TA) from ADB to support public administration reforms at the state level.3 The TA is \nincluded in the FSM country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018.4 A fact-finding mission on \n10\u201313 November 2015 reached an understanding with the government on the impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financial arrangements, and consulting services for \nthe TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5      \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  As a former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the FSM entered into the Compact with \nthe US in 1986.6 The amended Compact took effect in May 2004, providing US financial support \nfor a 20-year period. The FSM receives two streams of funds: Compact sector grants and \nCompact  Trust  Fund  (CTF)  contributions.  The  grants  finance  both  recurrent  and  capital \nspending  in  education,  health,  and  infrastructure,  and  the  annual  CTF  contributions  help \ngenerate alternative revenue flows once US assistance terminates after FY2023. \n \n4.   Total US assistance makes up about 60% of total consolidated government revenues \nfor FY2010\u2013FY2014. After FY2023, the FSM needs to replace the Compact sector grants with \nthe proceeds (investment returns) of the CTF. As of 30 June 2015, the value of the CTF is \nestimated at around $422 million, which is about $100 million below the estimated target. Fiscal \nconsolidation remains a core reform agenda for the country.  \n \n5.  A recent surge in fishing fee revenue under the Vessel Day Scheme and a one-off \nincrease of corporate tax revenues from captive insurance companies boosted the national \ngovernment\u2019s revenues. In FY2014, the national government ran a record fiscal surplus of $48 \nmillion, or 14% of gross domestic product. However, the states continued to operate tight \nbudgets and recorded a deficit of $7.6 million, or -2.4% of gross domestic product. Fiscal \n                                                \n1  Government of the Federated States of Micronesia. 2015. The 2023 Action Plan. Palikir.   \n2  ADB. 2012.

Technical Assistance to the Federated States of \nMicronesia for Strengthening Public Sector Performance. Manila (TA 7213-FSM). \n3  FSM consists of four states: Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap. Each state is administered by a governor and has \nits own Congress. \n4  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Federated States of Micronesia, 2016\u20132018. Manila.  \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 December, 2015. \n6  The Compact of Free Association between the FSM and the US provide for US economic assistance (including  \neligibility for certain US federal programs), defense of the FSM, and other benefits in exchange for US defense and \ncertain other operating rights in the FSM, denial of access to FSM territory by other nations, and other agreements. \n ", "2   \nadjustments at the state level are painful since states are highly dependent on the compact for \nfinancing even recurrent expenses, including compensation of employees. \n \n6.  Fiscal consolidation through both revenue and spending measures remains the key \ndevelopment challenge for the FSM. On the revenue side, revenue mobilization with better tax \nadministration  and  tax  reforms  remains  a  key  challenge,  since  the  long-planned  reform \ninitiatives have not yet been implemented because of the opposition of two states (highlighting \nthe important lesson of gaining state ownership of any planned reforms if they are to be \nsuccessful). It is also critical to establish an effective revenue-sharing system between the \nnational government and the states, based on a careful review of fiscal need and fiscal capacity. \nOn the expenditure side, public administration reforms are required to rationalize the general \ngovernment including the states to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness for its expenditure \ncontrol. \n \n7.  ADB has supported the public administration review of the national government with TA \n(footnote 2), helped the national government define the major challenges of administration \nreforms,  and  proposed  medium-term  measures  to  overcome  administration  hurdles.  Major \nreform areas covered under the TA projects were (i) rationalization of organizational structures \nbased  on  core  functions  of  each  government  unit;  (ii)  simplification  of  job  grade  and \ncompensation structures; (iii) integration of jobs under Special Service Contracts (SSCs) and of \nexempt  positions  into  the  Public  Service  System  (PSS);  and  (iv)  strengthening  of  the \nperformance  evaluation  system.  State  governments  are  faced  with  problems  found  at  the \nnational government.    \n \n8.  The structure of the national government is fairly complicated and fragmented, with \ndepartments, offices and agencies, that either directly report to the Office of the President or \noperate under boards that are appointed by the President, and whereby heads of departments \nhave no direct link to (or oversight of) the boards and agencies that operate in their respective \nsectors.  Some  of  the  agencies  are  reflected  in  the  national  budget,  others  are  not.  The \nPresident appoints heads of the agencies and they make up the Cabinet, but officially, this \ncomposition of the government is not clearly defined. The TA projects proposed a rationalized \norganizational structure based on core functions of each government unit and simplified its \nreporting system. \n \n9.  The total number of staff positions to perform the national government functions equates \nto 630 full-time employees. This includes 482 positions (76.5% of the total) filled by persons \nrecruited under the PSS. Some 46 positions (7.3%) are labeled \u201cexempt\u201d, while 91 positions \n(14.4%) are filled by staff employed under SSCs. Most of the latter positions, although not all, \nare funded under the US federal grant programs and, to a lesser extent, Compact funding. The \nexempted positions do not fall under the PSS regulations. It means that in the executive branch, \nless than 80% of the employed people are governed by the PSS regulations, and that over 20% \nhave preferential arrangements (higher salaries). The group of those in the SSC and exempt \npositions accounts for about 60% of the total wage bill. The national government has frozen the \nnominal wage as an expenditure control policy in the past years, which made it difficult to recruit \nskilled officials. The increase in the SSC and exempt positions was a measure to mobilize \nskilled workers without violating the nominal wage freeze for the staff under the PSS. The TA \nprojects prepared a reform option to integrate the SSC and exempt positions into the PSS. \n \n10.  Another critical issue in civil service management is an overly overlapping job grading \nand payment structure\u201433 grades and pay levels for a small public service with 630 staff. The \noverly duplicated compensation system implicitly emphasizes length of service and seniority \n ", "  3 \nrather  than  hierarchy  of  responsibility  and  supervision,  and  gives  minimal  scope  for  pay \ndifferentials that would compensate for differences in job content, responsibilities, and skill. The \nTA projects proposed to reduce the number of pay levels and/or job grades, and reduce the \namount of overlap between pay levels to increase pay differentials that would allow to honor \ndifferences in skills and responsibilities.  \n \n11.  Under the freeze of the nominal wage, most heads of government units have stopped \nperformance evaluation of their staff even through it is mandatory since there is no way to \nreward good performers. The TA proposes to revitalize the performance evaluation system to \nmeasure staff performance and provide appropriate feedback to the employees.  \n \n12.  The 2023 action plan is a road map for tackling the country\u2019s fiscal and economic \nchallenges up to and beyond FY2023. The action plan confirms the critical importance of fiscal \nconsolidation and economic growth. For fiscal consolidation, the action plan emphasizes the \nneed  for  effective  expenditure  control  through  better  administration  with  the  tax  and  tax \nadministration reforms. Based on the previous engagements in the public administration reforms \nat the national government, this TA focuses on public administration reforms at the state level. \nThe proposed TA intends to support the reform initiative by helping participating state authorities \nto develop a medium-term public administration reform plan that covers a reorganization of \ngovernment structures, rationalization and simplification of the job grading and pay structure, \nintegration of SSC and exempt positions into the PSS, and reinvigoration of the performance \nreview system. The TA will also help the state governments to introduce a corporate planning \napproach based on international experience to establish clear links between resource needs \nand resource allocations in the budgeting process. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be efficient public service provisions at the state level and a contribution \nto long-term fiscal consolidation. The outcome will be an endorsement of the medium-term \npublic administration reform plan by the Office of the Governor of each participating state and its \nsubmission to the State Congress.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will develop a medium-term public sector reform plan (for each participating \nstate), which covers the output areas described below, as appropriate. Throughout the TA \nimplementation, consideration will be given to an assessment of capacity development and \ntraining needs and, to the extent possible, this will be supported through training and workshops. \n \n15.  Output 1: Reorganization of government structures based on a functional review \nof government units. The TA will help simplify state government structures to better reflect key \nfunctions  and  responsibilities  of  each  government  unit,  and  the  reporting  system  will  be \nstreamlined with clear supervising responsibilities for a respective head of department. The \nreorganization of government structures will create an opportunity for state governments to \nconsider staff relocation across government units based on staff\u2019s needs for fulfilling their core \nfunctions.   \n \n16.  Output 2: Development of a corporate planning method linking core activities and \nresource requirements. Corporate planning activities, which link resource needs to fulfil core \n ", "4   \nfunctions of government units with resource and staff allocation is an indispensable requisite for \neffective fiscal consolidation. The TA will review international experience of corporate planning \nactivities in several countries to find suitable options for  consideration by the government.    \n \n17.  Output 3: Rationalization and simplification of the job grading and pay structure. \nSignificantly overlapping job grading and pay structures have persistently undermined staff \nincentives for good performance. A more balanced distribution of jobholders across the pay \nscales,  and  a  reduction  in  the  amount  of  overlap  between  pay  levels,  will  allow  state \ngovernments  to  increase  pay  differentials  to  compensate  for  differences  in  skills  and \nresponsibilities. Some support will also be given to the national government to finalize the civil \nservice reform bills based on the key recommendations of the previous TA projects. Under the \nleadership of the vice-president, the national government has a strong commitment to civil \nservice reforms.  \n \n18.  Output 4: Integration of Special Service Contract and exempt positions into the \nPublic Service System. As a result of the nominal pay stagnation, the public service found it \ndifficult to attract, retain, and motivate personnel with requisite skills. This led to a significant \nincrease  of  staff  under  SSC  and  exempt  conditions,  which  in  turn  hurt  staff  morale  and \nincentives among staff  under the PSS. Core staff under the SSCs and exempt position should \nbe integrated in the PSS because they were not given the same preferential treatment. Noncore \npositions should be contracted for a limited duration. Salaries for staff under SSCs and exempt \nconditions should be graded in line with PSS terms based on the results of an objective and \nsystematic job audit and evaluation process. \n \n19.  Output  5:  Reinvigoration  of  the  system  for  strengthening  merit-based  human \nresource management. Under the long nominal pay freeze, most heads of government units \nstopped performance evaluations even though these are mandatory. Updated job descriptions \nand an evaluation instrument or form will be developed to measure staff performance and \nprovide appropriate feedback to the employees. This will enable a merit-based salary increase \neven if the total wage bill will be controlled for fiscal sustainability. \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  The  offices  of  governor  in \nparticipating states will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, \nand other in-kind contributions (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The TA will be implemented in two states, selected on the basis of their commitment to \npublic administration reform. The national Ministry of Finance and Administration will be the \nexecuting agency and the  office of the governor in each participating state will act as an \nimplementing  agency.  The  offices  of  the  governor  will  provide  quality  assurance  and \ncoordination  with  other  departments,  state  agencies,  and  stakeholders.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented from January 2016 to November 2017.  \n \n22.  International  consultants  (14  persons-months,  intermittent)  will  be  recruited  using \nindividual consultant selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The consulting services under the TA will be engaged \n ", "  5 \nunder an output-based (lump\u2013sum) contract wherever possible. The consultants will report to \nADB  and  the  offices  of  the  governors  on  the  substance  and  timing  of  deliverables.  Key \nrecommendations of the TA will be discussed in final workshops in the target states, and a \nnational workshop on public administration reform will be organized to share reform options with \nthe national government and other states. Resource persons from the Philippines and Bhutan \nwho have long experience of establishing corporate planning systems will be invited to the \nnational forum to share their experience in civil service reforms and corporate planning activities. \nThe engagement of the resource persons will comply with ADB rules. The terms of reference for \nthe consulting services are in Appendix 3. All disbursements under the TA will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Federated States of Micronesia for the State-Level Public Administration \nReview (Phase 1), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \nThe TA will enhance the performance and efficiency of public service at the state level through public \nadministration reforms and contribute to the long-term fiscal consolidation.
