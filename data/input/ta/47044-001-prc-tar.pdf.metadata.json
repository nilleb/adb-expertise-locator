INTRODUCTION   \n1.  During the 2012 country programming review mission, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) through the Hunan Provincial Chang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan Resource-Conserving \nand  Environment-Friendly  Society  Office  (RES)  requested  policy  and  advisory  technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The TA was included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2013\u20132015 for the PRC.2 A TA reconnaissance mission was \nconducted on 15\u201318 March 2013. Government concurrence with the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  was \nobtained in a 27 May 2013 email. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Chang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan city cluster, located downstream in the Xiangjiang River watershed \nin Hunan province, is industrializing rapidly and resource use is degrading the environment. In \n2007, Chang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan was designated as an experimental zone for resource conservation and \nenvironmentally friendly development. Chang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan is central to the economic development \nof Hunan province, contributing 78.7% of the provincial gross domestic product; and 84.2% of \nthe province\u2019s emissions.3 Coal is the primary energy source in the province, providing 72.6%, \nfollowed by fuel oil (11.8%), hydropower (9.9%), and natural gas (1%). The heavy reliance on \ncoal and oil as energy sources pose major challenges to the effort to transform the Chang\u2013Zhu\u2013\nTan  economy,  and  pursue  environmentally  sustainable  growth  and  development.  The \npopulation of Chang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan is 40,227,500, and it is increasing at 6% per year. The gross \ndomestic product is CNY1,548 billion, which increased at an annual rate of 12.8% per year in \n2011. Most revenues (89.4%) are generated by secondary (e.g., smelting, manufacturing, and \nfood processing) and tertiary (culture, sports, and entertainment) industries. The per capita \nannual net income of rural residents in Chang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan is CNY8,115, and of urban residents, \nCNY22,179; this is significantly higher than the Hunan provincial average of CNY6,567 for the \nrural population, and CNY18,844 for the urban population. Hunan province is noted for its \nagricultural  capacity  and  mineral  deposits,  but  environmentally  sustainable  development  is \ncurrently at risk from industrial pollution, high rates of natural resource extraction, and land \nconversion.4 \n \n3.  The Xiangjiang River is the primary water source for domestic and industrial users in \nChang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan, and serves as a major transportation link throughout the  city cluster. Its \ncapacity to meet these needs is being affected by urbanization and industrialization. Forests \nand other open land are being designated for conversion, affecting local hydrologic cycles, river \nlevels, and water quality. A number of industries\u2014including nonferrous metal, food processing, \npetroleum and chemical, building materials, and paper\u2014are major sources of pollution in the \nwatershed. Large volumes of residential and industrial sewage and solid waste are produced in \nChang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan; most (about 77.0%) of the industrial sewage is treated, but only a small \nfraction (2.3%) of solid waste receives treatment. Pollution and waste inputs are affecting the \navailability of potable water.   \n \n                                                \n1  The RES is responsible for the ongoing implementation of the pilot reform program approved in 2007 by the State \nCouncil to speed up the construction of a resource-saving and environmentally friendly society, adopted at the Fifth \nPlenum of the 16th Communist Party of China Central Committee in 2006.   \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 May 2013.  \n3  Hunan  People\u2019s  Publishing  House.  2011.

New Industrialization Strategy of Hunan Province. Manila.  \n ", "2   \n4.  Chang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan covers 96,853.4 square kilometers (km2); 22,340 km2 (23.1% of total \narea) is under cultivation and 48,618 km2 (50.2%) is under forest cover, including 451.1 km2 \n(0.47% of the total area) designated as urban green area cover. Urban construction accounts \nfor 2,156.8 km2 (2.2%). The remaining 23,738.2 km2 (24.5%) includes residential areas, mining, \nwater conservancy, road and/or transportation areas, and unused land. Current forest cover, \nhowever, may potentially be converted to other uses under certain circumstances (e.g., national \nconstruction projects). The limited size of green areas and tree cover along the riverbanks is \ninsufficient  to  meet  the  needs  for  required  ecological  services,  such  as  maintaining  water \nquantity  and  quality,  air  purification,  pollination,  and  biodiversity  habitat.  Ecosystems  are \nseverely degraded, and threatened by pollution, overextraction of resources, and conversion \n(e.g.,  from  a  forest  ecosystem  to  a  grassland  ecosystem).  Climate  change  impacts  are \nexacerbating these challenges, and the annual average temperature has increased by 0.14\u00b0C \nper decade since 1961 (footnote 3).     \n \n5.  The Hunan provincial government (HPG) states that a major problem is the lack of \nestablished  structural  policy  promoting  ecological  protection;  constraints  include  unclear \nregulations and authority, weak enforcement, and lack of financial incentives. The PRC\u2019s 12th \nFive-Year Plan (2011\u20132015) requires implementation of eco-compensation. This could include \nmarket-oriented compensation mechanisms (e.g., a national eco-compensation fund, enterprise \nreserve fund, and balanced transfer payment in key ecological zones) as an incentive. As a \ndesignated  experimental  zone,  Hunan  is  implementing  eco-compensation  trials.  However, \ndespite  several  advances,  practical  solutions  are  still  lacking,  and  a  systematic  and \ncomprehensive eco-compensation mechanism and policy framework are needed, particularly in \nthe water sector. Upstream users are threatening downstream water supplies. The framework \nneeds to (i) identify environmental policy gaps and/or opportunities and perverse incentives, (ii) \nrank environmental threats and mitigation actions, (iii) calculate environmental and ecological \ncosts and/or benefits, and (iv) recommend an implementation mechanism. Changes in the land \nuse plan, such as increasing reforestation and nature reserves along the Xiangjiang River, are \nrequired to help in regulating water quality and abundance. Specific eco-compensation scheme \ndetails that need to be identified include the types of environmental services to be provided, the \ngeographic and financial scale, the identity of buyers and sellers, the institutional arrangements \nand legal framework, mechanisms to monitor and evaluate progress and compliance, and the \nconditionality and allocation of payments.  \n \n6.  The HPG seeks to address constraints to environmentally sustainable growth through a \nmix of well-developed strategies and policies, including pollution controls, appropriate land use, \nnatural resource conservation, and financial incentives. A well-developed eco-compensation \nmechanism can help in supporting the HPG\u2019s efforts through the provision of financial incentives. \nThis TA will address gaps in the regulatory and policy framework for an eco-compensation \nmechanism  for  the  Xiangjiang  River  watershed  in  Chang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan  through  analyses  of \necological  characteristics,  threats,  and/or  mitigation;  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  (CBA)  and  other \neconomic  analyses;  and  specific  eco-compensation  requirements.  The  TA  will  build  on \nrecommendations and lessons from previous international experience and ADB studies, such as \nusing eco-compensation to support integrated river basin management\u2014a subset of integrated \nwater  resources  management  (IWRM).5 The  outcomes  will  be  used  primarily  as  decision-\nmaking support for the HPG in the construction of a resource-saving and environmentally \nfriendly society in the Chang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan experimental zone. \n   \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2011.

The impact of the TA will be the improved environmental quality in the Xiangjiang River \nwatershed  of  Chang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan  city  cluster.  The  outcome  will  be  a  strengthened  eco-\ncompensation mechanism and policy framework to improve water quality and abundance in the \nXiangjiang River watershed. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) completed analyses of environmental threats to water \nquality and abundance, including their interrelationship with natural resource and land use in the \nXiangjiang River watershed; (ii) recommendations for the design and implementation of an eco-\ncompensation mechanism and policy framework; and (iii) strengthened government capacity in \nthe environmentally sustainable use of natural resources and land to improve water quality and \nabundance.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  (i)  develop  an  eco-compensation  mechanism \nimplementation strategy and action plan, including identification of priority activities, service \nproviders, potential buyers, recommendations for changes in natural resource and land use to \nincrease  water quality and  abundance,  and  a financing  plan;  and (ii)  increase  institutional \ncapacity to implement IWRM and eco-compensation. \n \n9.  The TA will be implemented over 16 months. During the first 4 months, the consultants \nwill  (i)  review  the  environmental  and  eco-compensation  policies  and  legal  framework,  and \nanalyze current environmental and socioeconomic data; (ii) identify environmental threats and \ntheir impacts, including climate change projections, water pollutants, droughts, and floods; and \n(iii) conduct a CBA and other financial analyses. \n \n10.  During months 5\u20138, the consultants will (i) prioritize threats based on technical criteria; \n(ii) review the current spatial plan, based on potential threats and economic opportunities; (iii) \nreview current management practices; (iv) prioritize economic approaches and actions based on \nthe CBA and other financial analyses; (v) design improvements to the legal and regulatory \nframework and management practices; (vi) conduct a survey of willingness to participate in eco-\ncompensation; (vii) facilitate a working group to develop the eco-compensation mechanism; \n(viii) design  an  eco-compensation  mechanism  and  policy  framework;  and  (ix)  conduct  a \nworkshop to discuss preliminary results. \n \n11.  During months 9\u201316, the consultants will (i) write a draft eco-compensation mechanism \nstrategy and action plan that identifies priority projects, makes recommendations for changes in \nnatural resource and land use, and includes a detailed work plan, budget, and financing plan; \n(ii) provide training, capacity building, a provincial study tour, and institutional strengthening in \neco-compensation, sustainable natural resource use, IWRM, CBA, and other financial analyses; \nand (iii) conduct workshops to inform and jointly review TA results. ADB and RES will jointly \nprepare  a  knowledge  product  regarding  eco-compensation  and  sustainable  resource  use \ntargeted to policy and decision makers. \n \n12.  The major assumptions considered include: (i) HPG departments will adopt relevant \nstrategies, targets, and activities to and support the cost of implementing the eco-compensation \nmechanism and policy framework; (ii) relevant HPG departments have sufficient understanding \nof and are committed to the need for an eco-compensation mechanism and policy framework; \nand (iii) relevant HPG departments have sufficient political strength to ensure that cross-sector \n ", "4   \nactions and recommendations for implementing the eco-compensation mechanism and policy \nframework will be generally supported. \n \n13.  The  key  risks  considered  include:  (i)  the  conflicting  priorities  for  environmentally \nsustainable economic development (some departments may be unable to reach consensus on \nmanagement strategies required for implementing an eco-compensation mechanism for the \nXiangjiang  river  watershed);  and  (ii)  funding  is  insufficient  to  fully  implement  the \nrecommendations required for implementation of the eco-compensation mechanism and policy \nframework after TA completion.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $725,000, of which (i) $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), and (ii) $225,000 will \nbe  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund6 under  the Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility administered by ADB. \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of remuneration and per \ndiem  for  counterpart  staff,  including  secretarial  assistance  and  translation  services;  office \naccommodation and supplies; domestic transportation; access to relevant government data and \nstudies for the consultants\u2019 use; meeting and/or office facilities, including other support to the \nconsultants  as  required;  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The RES will be the executing agency. \n \n17.  A TA management office will be established in the RES Division of Development to carry \nout day-to-day operations. The director of the Division of Development will serve as executive \ndirector  of the TA  management  office  and  will  be  responsible for coordinating  operational \nmatters and technical collaboration with the consultants. The RES will provide office space, \naccess  to  communications  and  copiers,  and  logistical  support  for  TA  implementation.  The \nexecutive  director  of  the  TA  management  office  will  also  be  responsible  for  submitting \nreimbursement claims for approved expenditures for logistical support for training, seminars, \nand conferences. \n \n18.  The  RES  will  convene  meetings  and  workshops  attended  by  relevant  offices  and \ndepartments during the inception, interim, and final stages of TA implementation. These will \ninclude the departments of agriculture, forestry, mining, water resources, and others at the city \nand provincial levels. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 16 months, tentatively starting on 1 December 2013 \nand ending on 31 March 2015. The consultants will submit to ADB an inception report within \n6 weeks of commencement, and an interim report 7 months after commencement. A draft final \nreport  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  12  months  after  commencement,  and  a  final  report  at \nconclusion. The inception, interim, and draft final reports will be subject to review by ADB and \n                                                \n6  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. The proposal for joint \nfinancing  was  submitted  in  May  2013,  and  approved by  the Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility  steering \ncommittee in July 2013.  \n ", "  5 \nthe government. All reports will be written in English and translated into Chinese. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The TA will be carried out by a team of consultants to be engaged through a firm, which \nwill provide 10 person-months of international and 42 person-months of national consulting \nservices.  TA  implementation  will  require  (i)  four  international  specialists  (team  leader  and \nintegrated watershed management specialist, environmental economics and eco-compensation \nspecialist, hydrology specialist, and water pollution specialist); and (ii) eight national specialists \n(deputy  team  leader  and  environmental  policy  and/or  institutional  specialist,  integrated \nwatershed  management  specialist,  eco-compensation  specialist,  environmental  economics \nspecialist,  hydrology  specialist,  climate  change  specialist,  water  pollution  specialist,  and \ngeographic information system specialist). ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with \nits Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The consulting \nfirm will be selected using simplified technical proposals and quality- and cost-based selection, \nwith a quality\u2013cost weighting ratio of 90:10 given the high technical complexity. Disbursements \nunder the TA will be  made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will reimburse the TA management office \nfor approved logistical support costs for training, seminars, and conferences. ADB will undertake \nintensive review and supervision by fielding missions at critical stages of implementation\u2014\nparticularly inception, interim, and final reviews\u2014and by extending regular support from ADB \nheadquarters and the PRC Resident Mission. \n \n21.  The  TA  results  will  be  disseminated  through  the  release  of  the  project  reports, \nworkshops, and media releases by ADB and the RES. A knowledge product will be developed \nand disseminated in hard copy by ADB, the PRC Resident Mission, and the RES; and will be \nposted on the ADB website. Outcome evaluation will follow ADB guidelines, and will be provided \nto the RES. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $225,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant \nbasis  to  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Eco-Compensation \nMechanism and Policy Framework Study for the Xiangjiang River Watershed of the Chang\u2013\nZhu\u2013Tan City Cluster, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources \nDesign  Performance Targets and  and Reporting \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved  By 2020:  Environmental  HPG departments will adopt \nenvironmental  Functional eco-compensation  protection  relevant strategies, targets, \nquality in the  mechanism and policy  bureau reports  activities, and costs of the \nXiangjiang River  framework implemented for  of the People\u2019s  strategy and/or action plan and \nwatershed of  the Xiangjiang River  Republic of  the eco-compensation policy \nChang\u2013Zhu\u2013Tan city  watershed  China   framework \ncluster  (2012 baseline: 0, Target: 1)   \nRisks \n     \nAverage water quality in the  Conflicting priorities for \n    \nXiangjiang River improved  economic development and \n    \n(2012 baseline: 12% Class  conservation  \n \nIV\u2013V, Target: 10%  Environmental \nFunding is insufficient to fully \nimprovement)   protection \nimplement the \nbureau reports \nrecommendations required for \nof the People\u2019s \nimplementation of the eco-\nRepublic of \ncompensation mechanism and \nChina  \npolicy framework after TA \ncompletion  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nA strengthened eco- By 2015:  RES letters of  There is sufficient \ncompensation  An eco-compensation  support for eco- understanding and \nmechanism and  mechanism and policy  compensation  commitment from relevant \npolicy framework to  framework document  mechanism  HPG departments on the need \nimprove water  supported by the RES (2012  and policy  for an eco-compensation \nquality and  baseline: 0, Target:1)  framework   mechanism and policy \nabundance in the       framework \nXiangjiang River      \nRelevant HPG departments \nwatershed     \nhave sufficient political \n      \nstrength to ensure that cross-\nsector actions, and \nrecommendations for \nimplementing the eco-\ncompensation mechanism and \npolicy framework are generally \nsupported \nRisk \nSome departments may be \nunable to reach consensus on \nmanagement strategies \nrequired for implementing an \neco-compensation mechanism \nand policy framework \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
