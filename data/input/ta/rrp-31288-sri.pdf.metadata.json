It will support the implementation of\npolicy and institutional reforms that the Government has recently\napproved,  which  include  setting  up  a  new  apex  body,  the\nNational Water Resource Authority (NWRA). The Project will\nbuild capacity in the NWRA to fulfil its mandate of managing the\ncountry\u2019s  water  resources  and  establishing  working  linkages\nwith key partner agencies1 in the water sector. Capacity will be\ndeveloped  through  practical  exercises  to  resolve  existing\nconflicts in three river basins. Infrastructure to improve water\nresource  management  will  also  be  constructed  under  the\nProject.\nClassification Primary - Environment\nEnvironmental Category  B\nAssessment An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken, and\nthe summary IEE is an appendix.\nRationale Rapid  industrial  growth,  urbanization,  and  increasing  water\ndemands in the agriculture sector in recent years have caused\nincreasing stress on Sri Lanka\u2019s water resources and highlight\nthe importance of more efficient and holistic management of the\nresource. Inefficiencies have been exacerbated by the fact that\na number of agencies exploit the water resource but operate\nmore or less independently of each other, with no single agency\nhaving  a  mandate  for  overall  management.  Both  the\nGovernment and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) place a\nhigh priority on establishing the NWRA and ensuring it functions\neffectively  with  existing  water  resources  agencies  so  as  to\nrectify the current inadequacies.\nDuring  project  preparation,  appropriate  investments  in\ninfrastructure  to  improve  water  resource  management  were\nidentified. Construction of the Kelani Conservation Barrage will\nprotect  the  water  supply  to  Greater  Colombo,  which  is\nthreatened by increasing salinity intrusion into the mouth of the\nKelani River and lowered river levels at the pump intakes. To\naccurately quantify the available river flows at critical times, it is\nalso proposed that low-flow weirs be constructed at strategic\nlocations in the key rivers.\nUndertaking  these  activities  will  prepare  the  country  for\nsustainable and equitable management of its water resources in\n                                                \n1 The partner agencies are existing agencies currently involved to some extent in water resource management.\nThey include the Irrigation Department, Ceylon Electricity Board, Water Resources Board, National Water Supply\nand Drainage Board, Central Environmental Authority, Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka, and provincial and district\nauthorities in the project area.", "iii\nthe future. It will meet the development objectives of both the\nGovernment and ADB by furthering the potential for rational and\nsustainable  economic  development  and  improving  the  well-\nbeing  of  a  significant  number  of  the  poorer  citizens  of  the\ncountry.\nObjective and Scope The objective of the Project is to strengthen the Government's\ncapacity  to  manage  its  water  resources  in  a  sustainable,\nparticipatory, and transparent way.  It will be implemented in two\nparts: (i) capacity building to assist in establishing NWRA and\nstrengthening existing agencies in the water sector (part A), and\n(ii) construction of urgently needed infrastructure for control and\nmeasurement of water resources (part B).\nPart A will have three components: (i) establishment of NWRA\nand  its  operational  links  to  other  water  agencies,  including\nprovision  of  office  facilities,  transport,  specialized  technical\nequipment,  and  related  technical  assistance;  (ii) database\nimprovement for water resource data collection and information\nmanagement by modernizing and expanding the monitoring and\ndata management and sharing facilities; and (iii) strengthening\nof  water  resource  management  by  supporting  the\nimplementation of plans in three pilot river basins. Part A will\nbuild capacity by providing practical exercises in the resolution\nof  real  water  use  problems  and  covering  the  activities  that\nNWRA  will  be  expected  to  undertake  as  a  full-fledged\noperational agency. A substantial part will be demand-driven\ntraining and demonstrations, designed in response to needs as\nthe  work  progresses.  The  training  will  include  twinning\narrangements  with  established  river  basin  organizations  in\ndeveloped or ADB\u2019s regional countries.\nPart B will consist of two construction components: (i) the Kelani\nConservation Barrage to restore the capacity of the water supply\nintake for Greater Colombo at Ambatale, and (ii) six low-flow\nmeasuring  weirs  for  accurate  measurement  of  low  flow  in\nselected critical rivers where there is competition for water.\nCost Estimates The total project cost is estimated at $28.2 million equivalent,\ncomprising about $14.8 million (52 percent) in foreign exchange\nand approximately $13.4 million equivalent (48 percent) in local\ncurrency costs.\nFinancing Plan $ million\nSource  Foreign          Local          Total\nExchange     Currency       Cost     Percent\nADB 14.8 4.9 19.7 70\nGovernment \u2013 8.5 8.5 30\nTotal 14.8 13.4 28.2 100\nLoan Amount and Terms The equivalent in various currencies of SDR 14,923,000 ($19.7\nmillion  approximately)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.", "iv\nThe  amortization  period  will  be  32  years  including  a  grace\nperiod  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1  percent  per\nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization Until June 2006\nExecuting Agencies Part A - National Water Resources Authority2\nPart B - National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB)\nImplementation Part  A  will  be  under  the  direction  of  the  director general  of\nArrangements NWRA, who will be responsible to the NWRA board. The project\nactivities  will  cover  all  sections  of  NWRA.  Several  partner\nagencies will take part as Implementing Agencies (IAs) for the\ndatabase improvement component and the component for water\nresource management in three pilot river basins.\nFor part B, a project management unit will be set up in NWSDB\nto  be  directly  responsible  for  implementing  the  Kelani\nConservation Barrage. The unit will have overall responsibility\nfor the low-flow weirs, although the Irrigation Department will be\nthe IA and undertake the design, construction, and operation of\nthe weirs.\nProcurement Goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment\npackages costing $100,000 - $500,000 may be purchased by\ninternational  shopping,  except  in  cases  when  specialized\nproprietary equipment is required and off-the-shelf purchase will\nbe permitted with prior approval from ADB. Equipment packages\ncosting less than $100,000 may be procured through off-the-\nshelf purchase.\nThe  procurement  method  for  the  training  and  demonstration\nprogram will vary, depending on the type of training. For short-\ncourse  and  academic  degree  training,  reimbursement  of\nexpenses  will  apply.  For  twinning  arrangements,  a  list  of\nprequalified  twinning  organizations  will  be  prepared  by  the\ntraining  consultants  at  the  inception  of  the  Project,  and  the\nappropriate  one  will  be  selected  according  to  the  training\nproposal.  All  training  will  be  carried  out  in  ADB  member\ncountries.\nThe Kelani Conservation Barrage will be constructed under a\nsingle civil works contract to be procured through international\ncompetitive  bidding.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  to  take\nresponsibility for design and construction supervision.\n                                                \n2  The Water Resources Secretariat, which is the existing precursor of NWRA, will be the interim Executing Agency\nfor part A at the beginning, pending formal creation of NWRA following passage of the National Water Resources\nAct in Parliament.", "v\nEach of the low-flow weirs will be constructed under a separate\ncivil works package. The size of each package is likely to be in\nthe range of $200,000 - $400,000, geographically scattered, and\ntherefore unlikely to be of interest to international firms. It is\nproposed  that  the  civil  works  for  the  weirs  will  be  procured\nthrough local competitive bidding, using procedures acceptable\nto ADB.\nConsulting Services The  Project  is  expected  to  use  111  person-months  of\ninternational  and  240  person-months  of  domestic  consulting\nservices. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of\ndomestic consultants.\nEstimated Project December 2005\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits The  long-term  social  impact  of  improved  water  resource\nand Beneficiaries management will be significant, since most conflicts in water use\nare ultimately social issues. Planning water use entails, to a\nlarge extent, the resolution of conflicting or competing uses of a\nlimited  resource  among  various  social  groups.  Having  a\nmechanism  to  do  this  through  NWRA,  river  basin  planning\ncommittees, and the Water Resources Tribunal ensures that\neach social group will be able, through a consultative process,\nto obtain maximum access to water in a way that is consistent\nwith the overall social good. Both agency staff and concerned\ncommunity groups working in the pilot river basins will benefit\nthrough the proposed training program. It is expected that at\nleast about a quarter of the participants will be women.\nFrom a poverty point of view, the existence of a functioning\nwater  resources  apex  body  will  provide  the  forum  for\nparticipatory and transparent consultations in water allocation.\nThe poorer segments of society will especially benefit from the\nopportunity to enunciate their water resource needs and the\nassurance that, to some extent, they will be met. In real terms,\nthis means that both the rural and the urban poor will have a\nvoice in determining their access to a resource that is essential\nto their physical and economic well-being and advancement.\nFor part B, the economic internal rate of return of the Kelani\nConservation  Barrage  has  been  estimated  at  about  22.1\npercent.  The  barrage  will  provide  improved  domestic  water\nsupplies to a population of about 330,000 in specific parts of\nGreater  Colombo  that  are  currently  suffering  interruptions  in\nsupply and low pressure. Almost half of this target population\n(approximately  44  percent)  are  considered  to  be  below  the\npoverty line.", "vi", "I.   THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan to\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Water Resources Management Project.\nII.   INTRODUCTION\n2. Since 1993 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been assisting the Government of Sri\nLanka  to  develop  the  institutions,  policies  and  capacity  to  manage  its  water  resources  on  an\nintegrated, multisectoral basis. Preliminary work in cooperation with other aid agencies began with\nadvisory  technical  assistance  (TA)1  under  which  an  Action  Plan  for  Comprehensive  Water\nResources Management was prepared. The formulation of the action plan was followed up in 1995\nwith  another  advisory  TA,2  which  provided  assistance  in  the  preparation  of  a  National  Water\nResources Policy, and in 1998 with project preparatory TA3 designed to operationalize the policy\nand initiate integrated water resource management investment. All three TAs have been successful\nand as a result, the National Water Resources Act is being prepared for submission to Parliament\nfor approval, the Government is taking steps to establish an apex water resources management\nbody, and a high-priority water conservation investment project has been identified.\n3. Following up on these activities and in support of the enhanced management of the country's\nwater resources, the Government has requested further assistance to help set up the apex water\nmanagement body recommended in the policy, and also to initiate investment in high-priority water\nmanagement infrastructure. In response to this request, ADB Fact-Finding and Appraisal Missions4\n(fielded in January and April 2000, respectively) assessed the nature of the support that could be\nprovided. The institutional needs that a newly organized water resources apex body would face were\nreviewed and the scope, urgency, and viability of a proposed investment project were assessed. A\nloan  project  proposal  was  formulated  in  cooperation  with  the  Government.  It  was  extensively\ndiscussed with stakeholders in the water resources sector as well as with potential beneficiaries and\nrepresentatives of other aid organizations. This report is based on the results of the three preceding\nTAs, field visits to typical areas of water resource stress, discussions with all concerned parties, and\nrefinements  made  during  Mission  wrap-up  discussions  with  Government  representatives.  The\nproject framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. The Water Resources Management Sector\n4. Sri Lanka is an island nation with limited water resources and an ever-increasing demand on\nthem.  From 1971 to 1998, the country's population increased from 12.6 million to 18.8 million, with\nno concomitant increase in the water resource. Indeed, gross water availability declined over the\nsame  period  due  to  pollution,  watershed  degradation,  increasing  seasonal  variability,  seawater\nintrusion into rivers, and the unsustainable extraction of groundwater.\n5. During the same period, urban areas as well as industrial growth expanded dramatically and\ntourism became an important earner of foreign exchange so that the locational and geographic\ndemand for water changed as significantly as the overall quantum demand.  In other words, water\n                                                \n1 TA 1918-SRI: Institutional Assessment for Comprehensive Water Resources Management, for $188,000, approved on\n30 July 1993.\n2 TA  2422-SRI: Institutional Strengthening for Comprehensive Water Resources Management,  for  $1.57  million,\napproved on 12 October 1995.\n3 TA 3030-SRI: Western River Basins Sector Project,  for $1.5 million, approved on 11 June 1998.\n4 The Mission comprised P.

O\u2019Sullivan, Counsel.", "2\nwas needed at places and in quantities deviating from past historical trends, when water was mainly\nfor irrigation and rural domestic use.\n6. Most sectors of the Sri Lankan economy are heavily dependent on water. Among them are\nagriculture, industry, power, fisheries, the commercial sector and tourism. None of them can perform\nto optimum efficiency in an environment of uncertain and restricted water use. Indeed, in the past 30\nyears almost all sectors of the economy in Sri Lanka rapidly expanded. Without water resources,\nthat expansion would not have been possible.  Expansion in agriculture has been achieved through\nmajor increases in the use of water for irrigation.  Increased use of hydropower has been the basis\nof growth in manufacturing and the service sectors. A major increase in the use of river water and\ngroundwater has allowed an expansion of urban areas and growth in manufacturing and tourism.\nThe country's rivers have supplied the sand required in large quantities as a construction material for\nthe country's recent building boom.\n7. Although Sri Lanka's total water supplies are abundant compared with those in some more\narid countries,5 water stress is now being experienced, and regional and seasonal variations in\nsupply and demand already create problems. One reason is that the country has a very high  year-\nto-year rainfall variability as well as high locational and seasonal variation. Another is the fact that\nthe quantum growth in water use over the past 30 years has been far greater than that envisaged\nduring the planning of each individual water development project or scheme.\n8. The country's vulnerability was seen in 1996 when drought conditions caused a substantial\nshortfall in paddy production; disrupted hydropower production, leading to island-wide power cuts;\nand forced several urban water supply systems to shut down. Stress on the country's water supplies\nis also seen in the increasing salinity intrusion into rivers emptying into the sea; the number of urban\nwater supply systems suffering from chronic, and occasionally acute, water shortages; and delays in\nnew domestic water supply investments because of uncertain water availability.\n9. A major reason for the worsening water supply situation despite the rather plentiful overall\nsupplies is the fact that, traditionally, water was considered an abundant resource readily available\nfor  all,  and  was  always  exploited  as  such.  Irrigation  accounts  for  some  80  percent  of  water\nconsumption and has always been provided free of any significant charge. The overuse of irrigation\nwater is common and paddy is sometimes grown on unsuitable, sandy soils, while downstream\nusers  may  not  have  sufficient  water  for  their  own  irrigation  or  domestic  use  requirements.\nHydropower reservoirs now provide a major part of the country's electricity needs, yet the timing of\nhydropower releases does not necessarily coincide with the peak requirements for agriculture or\ndomestic use. Groundwater has been considered a resource available for anyone who has the\nwherewithal  to  pump  it.  As  a  result,  urban  water  supply  schemes  and  new  industries  extract\ngroundwater without any control or consideration of the recharge capacity.  Moreover, any water\nbody is liable to be used as a convenient conveyance for factory or domestic sewage discharge, so\nthere is little restraint on the release of effluents into drainage ditches and water bodies. Even the\nsand in riverbeds is considered free for all and has been extensively mined in recent years to supply\nthe construction needs of a building boom.  This use has altered river morphology to such an extent\nthat  high  and  low  flow  patterns  completely  differ  from  historical  patterns,  and  saline  water\nincreasingly  intrudes  into  river  mouths.  Consequently,  domestic  water  supply  facilities  are\nendangered, while reduced flows and pollution are endangering sensitive wildlife habitats.\n                                                \n5 Mean annual rainfall in the southwestern quarter of the country, known as the wet zone, is 2,300 millimeters (mm)\nwhile in the more extensive dry zone to the east, north, and southeast it is 1,300 mm.  However, many rivers rise in\nthe wet zone and flow through the dry zone, providing a source of irrigation and domestic water. The overall variation\nis between 5,500 mm per annum in the wettest areas to 900 mm per annum in the driest.  A mean annual rainfall of\naround 1,700 mm is necessary to grow a wet season paddy crop without irrigation.", "3\n10. The inefficient use of water resources has been exacerbated by the fact that the resource\nhas been exploited by a variety of agencies, each pursuing its own mandate, with no single agency\nhaving stewardship over the country's water resources per se. The ADB-financed TA Institutional\nStrengthening for Comprehensive Water Resources Development (footnote 2) identified 28 agencies\nin 10 ministries responsible for one or more aspects of water resources management.  The major\nones are:\n (i) the Irrigation Department (ID), the Water Resources Board (WRB), and the Ceylon\nElectricity  Board  (CEB)  of  the  Ministry  of  Irrigation  and  Power,  responsible  for\nirrigation  development,  flood  control,  groundwater  development,  and  hydropower\ndevelopment (outside of the Mahaweli area);\n(ii)  the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) in the Ministry of Mahaweli Development\nwhich is responsible for the overall development of the Mahaweli River, the longest\nriver in the country, and its surrounding basin areas;6\n(iii)  the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) and the Sri Lanka Land\nand Reclamation Corporation in the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and\nConstruction, which is responsible for major urban water supply projects and flood\ncontrol and drainage projects, respectively;\n(iv)  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  (CEA)  in  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  and\nEnvironment, responsible for water quality; and\n(v) the provincial councils and local authorities, which are also responsible for water\nresources management issues at a local level.\n11. This  multiplicity  of  agencies  operating  in  the  water  management  sector  more  or  less\nindependently of each other has resulted in the following distortions and inefficiencies in water\nmanagement.\n(i) Some  large  water  users,  including  government  agencies,  allocate  water  to\nthemselves  and  thus  play  the  role  of  both  regulator  and  user  of  the  resource.\nAlthough they may take other users into account, they have no legal obligation to\nallocate water in an impartial manner.\n(ii)  Water required for environmental and social needs may not be protected since these\nuses are not recognized in policy and no mechanisms exist to legally safeguard\nminimum in-stream flows or reservoir levels for these requirements.\n(iii)  The supply of water for existing users is vulnerable where new water use continues to\nbe  allowed.  This  lack  of  control  on  water  demand  increases  the  risk  of  water\nshortages and reduces the value of downstream water-related investment.\n(iv)   Water  allocation  is  not  flexible  and  therefore  new  users  cannot  be  supplied  by\nvoluntary transfer of water from existing users.  This lack of flexibility also means that\nexisting users do not have the incentive to make more efficient use of their water\nsupply and to recognize the value of water.\n                                                \n6 The Mahaweli River flows out of the Central Highlands in the wet zone in the southwest of the country through much\nof the dry zone. It has been the source of most of the irrigation water for new settlements and agricultural and\nhydropower development sponsored by the Government. A large amount of funding for these developments has been\nprovided by the World Bank and bilateral aid agencies.", "4\n(v)  There is no planning system that would allocate water to priority uses either in the\nlong run or during critical drought periods that are likely to occur in the near term.\n12. To remedy the situation and to begin managing Sri Lanka's water as a scarce resource\nrather than a freely available public commodity, there is an overriding need for an agency or body\nwith the authority to manage the country's water resources on a global or holistic basis. The\nestablishment of such an apex agency and the passage of legislation to provide it with meaningful\npowers are the major recommendations of the TA for Institutional Strengthening for Comprehensive\nWater  Management  (footnote  2).  This  is  spelled  out  in  a  document  entitled  National  Water\nResources Policy and Institutional Arrangements (summary in Appendix 2) which was prepared\nunder the TA. The TA findings and the policy have been endorsed by ADB and also by all concerned\nagencies in the water management sector in the country. Legislation establishing the National Water\nResources Authority (NWRA), and giving it the mandate to manage the country's water resources is\nbeing processed. It is expected to be introduced in Parliament in early 2001 and to become effective\nnot later than December 2001 (Appendix 3, Table A3.1).\n13. The  consequences  of  poor  water  management  are  felt  most  severely  by  the  poorer\nsegments of the country's population. As the competition for water increases, reduced availability\ncombined  with  deteriorating  quality  is  posing  serious  problems  to  public  health  and  further\ndevelopment activities. The poor have the least ready access to safe, potable water for domestic\nuse. They can least afford medical care after becoming ill from contaminated water, suffer most from\nreduced incomes due to deficient irrigation water supplies, and suffer most from lost employment\nopportunities when industries cannot be established due to inadequate water supplies or unresolved\nwater use conflicts.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n14. As noted in paras. 10 and 11, current Government policies have traditionally focused on the\nmanagement of water resources on an agency-by-agency basis and have been generally designed\nto  maximize  the  operational  benefits  of  a  particular  agency  within  its  particular  mandate.  For\nexample, the ID focuses on maximizing water use for irrigation, while NWSDB focuses on providing\nthe maximum domestic water supply possible to the largest possible number of users. In some\ncases, the different emphasis may entail policies aimed at water conservation or efficient use, but\ngenerally the aim is to make available greater supplies within the same sector. Thus, programs for\nmore efficient use of irrigation water are generally focused on making more water available for other\nirrigators, and programs aimed at reducing leakage and increasing cost recovery in domestic water\nsupply schemes are primarily focused on conserving water so as to expand coverage.\n15. In other cases, policies being pursued by Government agencies are even potentially (or\nactively) inimical to the conservation and rational use of water resources.  Agriculture development\nprograms and preferential credit schemes that promote the use of tubewells or low-lift pumps for\nirrigation are being undertaken without regard for the availability or sustainability of groundwater or\nriver  water  resources.  Industrial  estate  developments  are  being  pursued  without  adequate\nconsideration of the need for freshwater nor the need to dispose of effluents. Some government\ncontracts require the use of clean, sorted river sand for construction projects. The result is excessive\nsand mining in the country\u2019s rivers.\n16. Integrated water resource management is, however, not completely unknown or unpracticed\nin the country. MASL, having full powers over the water resources within its mandated area, does\nbalance the demand and supply between such conflicting uses as power generation and irrigation\nwater supply, and actively encourages water conservation measures among the farmers in its", "5\nirrigation  areas.  However,  its  management  does  not  extend  to  domestic  and  industrial  water\nrequirements, inland fisheries, groundwater, or the environmental aspects of water use.\n17. Interagency cooperation in water resources management is also not unknown. The CEB and\nNWSDB, for example, do consult on hydropower reservoir releases to prevent crises in domestic\nwater supply schemes, and local level officials do have the authority to bring agencies together to\nwork out water use conflicts. However, any interagency agreement is nonbinding and depends on\nthe goodwill of one agency toward another.\n18. In the case of sand mining, the Government has acknowledged its major adverse effect on\nthe  country\u2019s  rivers  and  recently  initiated  action  to  address  it.  A  task  force  appointed  by  the\nPresident\u2019s secretariat is in the process of finalizing recommendations for control; however, the\nrecommendations  are  essentially  administrative  in  nature.  A  study  to  review  sand  mining\nalternatives, including cost recovery options, will be undertaken as part of the Coastal Resource\nManagement Project.7\n19. The  approach  to  management  of  water  resources  will  change  with  the  enactment  of\nlegislation to establish NWRA (para. 12), together with an advisory Water Resources Council8 and a\nWater Resources Tribunal. NWRA, the council, and the Tribunal will together form the water sector\napex  body  responsible  for  coordinating,  planning,  regulating,  and  monitoring  national  water\nresources and resolving disputes in the sector. They will be parallel bodies, each reporting to the\nhead of state. The Council will advise NWRA on coordination at the national level and on resolution\nof interprovincial and interagency water disputes. With respect to draft policies and river basin plans,\nthe Council will guide NWRA and endorse its recommendations before submission to the Cabinet for\napproval. However, in all other matters NWRA will be directly responsible to the head of state. The\nTribunal will be an independent appeal tribunal, which will meet on an as-needed basis. It will be\nresponsible to the head of state for administrative purposes, but will have statutory independence\nand be free of political interference. In their areas of responsibility, the three bodies will have a\nhigher level of authority over the other national water agencies, which will be subject to their\noversight and direction (Appendix 4, Figure A4.1), and will thus be in a position to ensure that water\nresources are rationally and fairly developed and exploited.\n20. The role of NWRA as set out in the National Water Resources Policy will be to address the\nfollowing aspects:\n (i)  the formulation of national water resources policies;\n(ii)  long-term national and river basin planning of water resource use, including the\ncoordination of local input;\n(iii)  coordination and collection of water resource data and information management,\nwater monitoring, and the commissioning of research;\n(iv)  bulk water allocation through the issuance of water entitlements;\n(v)  provision of advice to the government regarding drought and flood management;\n                                                \n7  Loan 1716-SRI: Coastal Resource Management Project, for $40,000,000 approved on 7 December 1999.\n8  An interim Water Resources Council was set up in 1995; it will become permanent under the legislation. The council is\na senior-level consultative body representing the public and private sectors. It has 16 members: 7 are secretaries and\n2 are directors general of ministries involved in water resources management; the 7 others represent the private\nsector, farmers, nongovernment organizations, academia, and women\u2019s interest.", "6\n(vi)  formulation of policy for the use of the nations water resources and monitoring its\nimplementation; and\n(vii)  public information and awareness of  water resource management issues.\n21. In addition to NWRA, the policy envisages the establishment at the local and provincial levels\nof river basin or groundwater committees to monitor the use of water resources, identify water\nmanagement issues, prepare development plans, recommend water allocations, and act as a forum\nfor the resolution of water conflicts.\n22. These  plans  are  expected  to  be  implemented  gradually.  Their  success  depends  on\nacceptance by all parties of the value and use of NWRA and its proven efficacy in resolving water\nresource conflicts and issues. For this reason, its initial operations will be on a limited scale in a\nlimited number of pilot basins, expanding eventually nationwide.\n23. It is noteworthy that, even prior to the establishment of NWRA, provincial governments have\nalready approached the Water Resources Secretariat (WRS),9 requesting assistance in resolving\ntheir water resource management problems.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n24. ADB has taken the lead among funding agencies in providing external assistance to Sri\nLanka for integrated water resources management.  The core of this assistance has been two\nadvisory TAs  (Institutional Assessment for Comprehensive Water Resources Development and\nInstitutional  Strengthening  for  Comprehensive  Water  Resources  Management) and  one  project\npreparatory TA (Western River Basins Sector Project). In addition, Sri Lanka is one of the countries\nparticipating  in  an  ongoing  regional  TA  for  the  development  of  effective  water  management\ninstitutions.10  ADB  assistance  has  been  supplemented  by  assistance  from  other  aid  agencies,\nnotably  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  which  provided  parallel\nfunding for TA on institutional assessment; Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), together with\nthe Netherlands Government, which provided assistance through the Interregional Water Law and\nPolicy Advisory Program; and Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), which financed\nthe project Environmental and Socio-Cultural Dimensions of Water Resources Planning in Sri Lanka.\n25. Further  assistance  is  currently  provided,  with  Norwegian  Agency  for  International\nCooperation (NORAD) parallel financing as part of the technical assistance package provided under\nthe ADB loan-financed Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. 11 This project consists of\nassistance in resolving existing water use conflicts in the Anuradhapura area and the preparation of\na strategy and action plan to improve water resources monitoring and data management.\n26. Planned future assistance for water resources management (besides the proposed Project)\nconsists of the project Integrated Water Resource Management Planning and Implementation to be\nfinanced by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), and a follow-on of the\nFAO  project  Implementation  of  a  Water  Rights  System.  The  AusAID  project  will  cover  the\npreparation of a national water resources plan, the preparation of three river basin plans, and a\ntwinning arrangement to assist NWRA in its initial operations.  The FAO project, on the other hand,\nwill constitute a second phase of the Water Law and Policy Advisory Programme and will support\n                                                \n9 An interim body set up to implement the water resources management TAs and is the precursor of NWRA.\n10  TA 5812-REG: Third Agriculture and Natural Resources Research at CGIAR Center, Development of Effective Water\nManagement Institutions, for $1,250,000, approved on 22 October 1998.\n11  Loan 1575-SRI: Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, for $75,000,000, approved on 6 November 1997.", "7\nthe implementation of the water rights and allocation component of the National Water Resources\nPolicy. External assistance to the water sector is summarized in Appendix 5.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n27. ADB has had extensive experience in the water resources sector in Sri Lanka with the\nimplementation of water resources infrastructure projects. These range from irrigation development\nand irrigation improvement, to aquaculture development and water supply and sanitation projects.\nProject Completion Reports (PCRs)12 have been completed for five of these projects and Project\nPerformance  Audit  Reports  (PPARs)13  for  three  of  them.  The  relevant  conclusions  from  these\nreports follow:\n(i)   there is a need for an integrated approach to water resource assessment before\ncommencing water resources infrastructure projects;\n(ii)  projects  should  not  be  too  ambitious  and  should  take  into  account  local-level\ninstitutional and technical capacity limitations;\n(iii)  projects  can  generally  be  completed  to  adequate  standards,  but  delays  due  to\ngovernment procedures, contracting disputes, unexpected political events, and at\ntimes, ADB's own procedures often result in later than expected completion and\nbenefit generation;\n(iv)  it is possible to encourage more efficient water use practices at the field level;\n(v)  the establishment of sustainable participatory approaches to water management is\ntime-consuming and not well-suited to short-term TA inputs. Moreover, adequate\ninstitutional capacity in this aspect is essential at all levels;14 and\n(vi)   NWSDB has developed into a technically competent agency whose capacity has\nbeen proved through implementation of various water supply and sanitation projects\nto the point where it can implement projects on time and within the budget.\n28. The proposed Project will be the first in the water resources management sector. The\nlessons learned that are directly related to this aspect are derived from the results of the three TAs\nalready provided in that sector (para. 2). The lessons are in fact significant and to a large extent\npositive, and the Project has been designed to take them into consideration.\n29. The first and most important lesson is that, despite a wide range of vested interests and\nconflicting mandates, through a process of consultation and participation it is possible to reach\nconsensus among the stakeholders for improved governance in the water sector. At the outset of the\nTA  support,  many  key  agencies  were  uninterested  in,  or  even  hostile  to,  the  concept  of\ncomprehensive water resources management, with concerns that their mandate or very existence\nwas threatened. Some were reluctant to accept that another agency will have ultimate control of the\ncountry's water. Ultimately, it was possible to convince each agency that reforms were essential for\n                                                \n12 PCR: SRI IN 170-79: Walawe Development Project, December 1979; PCR: SRI 19025: Kirindi Oya Irrigation and\nSettlement Project, September 1995; PCR: SRI 16025: Aquaculture Development Project, January 1993; PCR: SRI\n16051: Walawe Irrigation Improvement Project, June 1996; and PCR: SRI 18057: Water Supply Sector Project,\nSeptember 1997.\n13 PPA: SRI 0070: Walawe Development Project, August 1982; PPA: SRI 16051: Walawe Irrigation Improvement\nProject, December 1999; and PPA: SRI 16025: Aquaculture Development Project, August 1995.\n14  Note that the concept of NWRA has been developed through an extensive process of participation and consultation by\nthe Water Resources Council and Water Resources Secretariat with assistance of the ADB TAs (para. 2).", "8\nlong-term security of water allocations and were in the best interests of that agency and the country.\nParticularly significant is that the existing agencies agreed to the establishment of an apex body that\nwould have authority over all of them.\n30. The second lesson learned is that, in view of the diverse range of sector interests and social\ngroups involved, the problems facing the water resources sector are highly complex. Not only is\nthere competition for water between sectors, but there are also conflicts within sectors, and for some\nimportant uses such as environmental sustainability there is no advocate or agency mandated to\nlobby, monitor, or protect water availability or quality. There are already clear signs that stakeholders\nare seeking guidance and assistance in resolving conflicts between water users in river basins.\nRelated to this, it is notable that provincial administrations have already contacted WRS directly for\nassistance in resolving water management problems, thus preempting the role of NWRA (para. 23).\nThis highlights the urgent need for comprehensive water resources management and the need for a\nneutral entity to arbitrate among existing agencies and other stakeholders.\n31. A third significant lesson is that, to improve water resources management, there is a need to\nchange attitudes at the grassroots level to encourage efficient and optimal use of water. The concept\nof efficient water use is gradually being adopted at the field level in several parts of the country. In\nsome areas, farmers have been convinced to switch from growing paddy to raising other crops with\nlower water demand on unsuitable soils. Other programs are aimed at farmers' groups taking over\nthe management and operation of the distributory canal networks, including the allocation and\nmanagement  of  water.  Experiments  are  also  being  conducted  where  farmers  form  agriculture\ncompanies to manage their land and water resources in return for guaranteed access to land and\nwater rights.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n32. ADB's draft water policy15 aims to foster an integrated approach to water service delivery and\nwater resources management in ADB\u2019s operations and in the operations of its member countries.\nAmong the elements of this policy are:\n(i) the promotion of effective national water policies and action programs;\n(ii)  improved management of water resources based on comprehensive water resource\nassessments;\n(iii)  fostering the efficient and sustainable use and conservation of water;\n(iv)  investment in water resource management in priority river basins; and\n(v)  improved governance in the water sector through investments in capacity building,\nmonitoring, evaluation, and research.\n33. The 1998 Sri Lanka Country Operational Strategy translates these goals into the following\nspecific elements of the country program:16\n\"Support  for  comprehensive  water  resource  management  will  consolidate  recent\ninstitutional  changes  in  the  sector,  strengthen  the  capability  of  the  recently\n                                                \n15    Asian Development Bank. 2000.

Working Paper 7-00,\n9 August.\n16 STS:SRI 16-99 (Memo to the Board): Country Operational Strategy Study, Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,\nDecember 1998, para. 77 (iii).", "9\nestablished Water Resources Council and Secretariat as the water apex body, and\nfacilitate agency restructuring in the water sector, leading to the formation of an\nagency responsible for water resource allocation and management. An integrated\napproach to water resources management will be the guiding principle for Bank\noperations in this sector during the strategy period, and any assistance to the water\nsector will be provided in this framework. Bank assistance will aim at translating\nnational policy and institutional arrangements into practice through river basin level\nplanning  and  implementation,  the  resolution  of  conflicts  in  water  use,  and/or\ninnovative management arrangements.\"\n34. In relation to ADB\u2019s overarching goal of poverty reduction, comprehensive water resources\nmanagement will have a particularly positive impact. As noted in para. 6, almost every sector in the\nSri Lanka economy is dependent on access to water. Assured access to water, which can come\nabout only through comprehensive water resources management, is required to strengthen the\nenabling  environment  for  several  of  the  country's  productive  sectors,  including  agriculture,\nmanufacturing,  commercial  services,  and  tourism,  thus  bringing  concomitant  increases  in\nemployment and household incomes and a reduction in poverty levels. On a more direct basis, often\nthe poorer sectors of society are the first to suffer from restricted access to water resources, both as\ndomestic supply and use for productive purposes such as agriculture or fisheries. Ensuring that\naccess to basic water needs for the whole of the country's population is maintained will thus have its\nstrongest impact on the poorer sectors of society.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n35. ADB's involvement in integrated water resource management in Sri Lanka represents a\nsignificant achievement in policy dialogue and will lead to greatly improved governance in the water\nresources sector. A number of issues thus have been or need to be addressed. They include\n(i) establishing a suitable institutional framework, (ii) developing an appropriate policy, (iii) preparing\nlegislation based on the policy, and (iv) building the capacity within the relevant institutions to\nimplement sustainable water resource management in accordance with the legislation.\n36. The major vehicle so far for addressing these issues has been the three TAs provided for\nintegrated water resources management since 1993 (para. 2). At the beginning of the first TA\n(Institutional  Assessment  for  Comprehensive  Water  Resources  Management),  the  concept  of\nmanaging water resources on an integrated basis and as a scarce resource was new and not readily\nacceptable to many government agencies in the water sector.  Nonetheless, by the end of the TA in\n1995, an action plan for comprehensive water resources management, designed to initiate policy\nand  legal  reform  and  institutional  strengthening,  had  been  formulated  and  accepted  by  the\nGovernment. As a direct result, interim arrangements were put in place to strengthen the institutional\nframework. Two important bodies were set up: the Water Resources Council and the associated\nWater Resources Secretariat. The Council is a senior-level consultative body representing both the\npublic and private sectors (para. 19). The WRS acts as the day-to-day secretariat to the Council and\nis staffed mainly through secondments from agencies active in water resources management such\nas ID, MASL, NWSDB, and the CEB. It also acts as a counterpart agency for externally assisted\nprojects focusing on water resources management.\n37. After its establishment, the WRS became the Executing Agency (EA) for ADB's second water\nresources  management  TA,  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Comprehensive  Water  Resources\nManagement. Under this TA, the Government made great progress in advancing policy, institutional\nand legislative reforms in the water sector. The broad representation of the Council (para. 19)\nprovided an effective forum for a participatory and consultative approach, making it possible to reach\nconsensus on future reform measures. The culmination of this work was the publication of a National", "10\nWater Resources Policy and Institutional Arrangements, which was approved by the Cabinet in\nMarch 2000. This is a key milestone in the process for permanent institutional and legislative\nreforms for the comprehensive management of the country's water resources. It clears the way for\nthe establishment of a permanent apex body, comprising NWRA, working in conjunction with the\nCouncil and the Water Resources Tribunal (paras. 19 and 20).\n38. With the expected passage through Parliament of the National Water Resources Act, which\nembodies  the  National  Water  Resources  Policy  and  Institutional  Arrangements,  ADB  will  have\ncontributed significantly to a major aspect of policy and institutional reform for the management of\none of the country's key natural resources. The Project will provide further support by building the\ncapacity to implement the reforms. The policy principles cover the key aspects for sustainable\nmanagement, including pricing of water and sharing of costs among beneficiaries in an equitable\nmanner.  The  priority  aspects  that  will  be  introduced  under  the  policy  reforms  include\n(i) establishment of water rights whereby water is allocated on the basis of agreed-upon priorities\nand/or in accordance with principles of economic efficiency; (ii) demand management\u2014which will\nallow water entitlements to be transferable\u2014and control of unauthorized water use; (iii) introduction\nof  the  management  of  groundwater  resources,  which  has  been  unregulated  in  the  past;  and\n(iv) improved  information  management  through  establishment  of  a  comprehensive  centralized\ndatabase with proper arrangements for data sharing and access. Further details of the Policy are\noutlined in Appendix 2.\n39. The  establishment  of  NWRA  cannot  be  formalized  until  after  passage  of  the  Act  in\nParliament. Although it is evident that the Government is committed to finalizing the process as soon\nas possible, it is also recognized that it is not realistic to fast-track the process, given the ongoing\nneed for consultations and consensus at all levels. The elections scheduled for late 2000 are also\nexpected to cause delays. Nevertheless, assurances under the Project commit the Government to\nthe establishment of NWRA. The Cabinet is to approve the draft legislation by 31 May 2001 and\nNWRA is to be established and functioning by 31 December 2001 (Appendix 3, Table A3.1). In the\nmeantime, it has also been agreed to build the WRS in advance of the passage of the Act according\nto a time-bound action plan (Appendix 3, Table A3.2) so that it will commence functioning more or\nless in the same way it would if it were formally NWRA. However, the WRS will not have the backing\nof legislation to formally implement basin plans and water allocation. In the first year or two, that will\nnot constrain operations since it will be the period of assessment, consultation, and plan preparation.\n40. Establishment of NWRA and the related policy principles is considered a prerequisite for\ncontinuing policy dialogue on key issues related to water resource management and further building\non the achievements that have been made over the last seven years or so. It is intended that NWRA\nwill actively promote public consultation and participation in policy issues at all levels, from bulk\nwater allocations to the major stakeholders down to the individual beneficiaries. Cost recovery for\nsustainable  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  aimed  at  more  efficient  use  of  water  will  be\naddressed. Through linkages to existing ADB water supply projects, it has been possible to obtain\nagreement with the Government on a policy paper for tariff revisions, which was approved in June\n2000.\n41. In the longer term, it is envisaged that the policy and institutional reforms in the water\nresources management sector will lead to strategies for cost recovery of O&M in the irrigation\nsector. Despite the failure in 1984 of attempts to introduce fees for irrigation O&M, the Government\nrecognizes the need to work toward future reforms in that area. NWRA\u2019s role will include conducting\npublic information and education campaigns to develop a community-wide understanding of the real\ncosts of water. This will be linked to fostering farmer organizations and working toward handing over\nO&M responsibilities to these organizations. The Project will support a Government pilot project in\nwhich farmers form agriculture companies to manage their land and water resources responsibly as", "11\na cohesive unit, in return for guaranteed access to land and water rights.17 Other programs are\naimed  at  farmers  groups  taking  over  the  management  and  operation  of  the  distributory  canal\nnetwork, including the allocation and management of water.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.     Rationale\n42. When Sri Lanka had a predominantly rural, agrobased economy with few industries and only\na limited urban population, integrated water resource management was not a pressing issue. Water\nwas used primarily for irrigation or domestic rural supply, and competing demands for other uses\nwere  easily  accommodated.  In  the  more  recent  past,  however,  this  picture  has  changed\ndramatically.  Rapid industrial growth has led to major additional demands, and the growth of urban\nareas throughout the country has raised the water requirements in areas and locations where they\nwere traditionally much more modest. Moreover, the development of intensive cropping has led to\nincreased water demand in the agriculture sector.\n43. As a result, while the country does not face a water management crisis, there are signs of\nincreasing stress on the water resource and competition between users. The increasing degree of\ncompetition and stress are occurring while climatic variability, watershed degradation, and pollution\nare threatening the water resource itself. In some areas, the combination of low water availability\nand poor quality of the supply is a constraint to further development and is causing public health\nproblems. As pointed out in para. 13, the impact is most severe on the poor.\n44. Over  the  past  three  years,  the  Water  Resources  Council  and  the  WRS  have,  with  a\nsubstantial amount of effort and a high degree of cooperation from other water sector agencies,\nbeen able to produce the National Water Resources Policy and Institutional Arrangements.  This\ndocument sets out fundamental water resources policies and an institutional structure for water\nresources  management  in  the  country.  Central  to  the  institutional  arrangements  (and  the\nimplementation of the policies) is the establishment of NWRA, together with a permanent Water\nResources Council and Water Resources Tribunal, as the apex body (para. 19). NWRA will guide\nthe implementation of the National Water Resources Act, coordinate the activities of agencies active\nin water planning and water use, and be the ultimate authority responsible for bulk allocations and\ndispute resolution in the water sector.\n45. Both the Government and ADB place a high priority on establishing NWRA and its functional\nlinks with existing water resources agencies.  The Project thus aims to support the establishment of\nNWRA and to help develop its capacity, and that of its partner agencies,18 to carry out effective\nwater resource management in the country.\n46. During project preparation, it was possible to identify one clear source of stress on the\ncountry\u2019s water resources, resulting from competing uses, and a solution to it was designed. Lower\nriver levels and increasing salinity intrusion into the mouth of the Kelani River threaten the whole of\nthe water supply to Greater Colombo, an area of 730 square kilometers with a population of 1.6\nmillion. The construction of a control structure near the existing water supply intake will provide an\nenvironmentally sound, cost-effective, and technically feasible means of protecting Colombo\u2019s water\nsupply.\n                                                \n17  It is proposed that the Project provide training and demonstrations in the Ridi Bendi Ela Irrigation Scheme in the\nDeduru Oya Basin. It is a high-profile pilot scheme, which has attention at the highest level of Government.\n18 The partner agencies are Irrigation Department, Ceylon Electricity Board, Water Resources Board, National Water\nSupply and Drainage Board, Central Environmental Authority, the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka, and provincial and\ndistrict authorities in the project area.", "12\n47. Undertaking these activities will prepare the country for future, meaningful management of its\nwater resources and also address one of the immediate and urgent consequences of the lack of\nadequate integrated water resource management planning in the past. The Project will meet the\ndevelopment objectives of both the Government and ADB by furthering the potential for rational,\nsustainable economic development and improving the well-being of a significant number of the\npoorer citizens of the country.\nB.   Objective and Scope\n48. The objective of the Project is to strengthen the Government's capacity to manage its water\nresources in a sustainable, transparent, and participatory way, and to mitigate the effects of past\nuncoordinated water resource use. This objective will contribute to the overall sector goal of the\nProject to establish the sustainable management of water resources through the implementation of a\nnational water policy under adequate institutional arrangements. The Project will comprise two parts:\n(i) capacity building designed to assist in the establishment of NWRA and the strengthening of\nexisting agencies in the water sector (part A), and (ii) the construction of urgently needed water\nresource control and measuring infrastructure, specifically, a control structure on the Kelani River to\nprotect the water supply to the Greater Colombo area and the construction of low-flow measuring\nweirs on the Kelani and other critical rivers (part B).\n1.  Institutional Development (Part A)\n49. Part A will have three components: (i) establishment of NWRA and its operational links to\nother water agencies, (ii) strengthening water resource data collection and information management\nand sharing, and (iii) capacity building in preparation of water resource management plans.\na. Establishment of the National Water Resources Authority\n50. It is envisaged that a fully staffed and operational NWRA will have 51 full-time staff, of whom\n34 will be at a professional level.  Bringing such an agency into being requires capital costs in the\nprovision of office space, office equipment, transport facilities, and specialized technical equipment.\nThat will be provided by the Project. International and national consulting services will be made\navailable  to  provide  guidance  in  policy  formulation,  river  basin  planning,  water  resource\nadministration; and also advise partner agencies (para. 45) on the restructuring required to fulfill\ntheir mandates as water resource managers in cooperation with NWRA. Domestic and international\nproject  coordinators  and  training  specialists  will  be  financed  under  this  component.  A  national\nfinance and administration specialist will be provided to build NWRA\u2019s capacity to administer loan-\nfinanced projects.\nb. Database Improvement\n51. Data on the water resource in Sri Lanka is patchy, often outdated, and unreliable due to\nrecent environmental changes from activities such as sand mining. It is also difficult to assemble\nsince it is collected and held by a number of separate agencies. Under these circumstances, any\nmeaningful management and planning activities are difficult to carry out.\n52. Data for surface water is the most readily available, but may be unreliable due to the age of\nthe monitoring system and the great number of environmental changes that have taken place in the\npast few decades.  Data for groundwater is sparse, except in certain well-defined and restricted\nareas, so that little is known about the overall groundwater resource of the country. Similarly, except\nin certain specific locations, data on water quality as a time series is almost nonexistent.", "13\n53. Without a comprehensive knowledge of the water resource that they will be mandated to\nmanage, NWRA and its partner agencies will find it very difficult to assess the size and extent of the\nresource, the potential for future development, and the dangers inherent in unregulated use. In\nparticular,  it  will  be  difficult  to  determine  the  amount  of  water  that  can  safely  be  allocated  to\ncompeting users.\n54. Through  the  database  component,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the  collection,  storage,\nmanagement, and sharing of data and information for surface water, groundwater, and water quality.\nFor surface water the activities will consist of (i) the provision and establishment of modernized\ngauging  stations,  (ii)  the  provision  of  hydrometric  equipment,  and  (iii)  the  provision  of  data\nmanagement equipment as well as transport facilities for the data collection staff.19 For groundwater\nthe activities involve (i) the sinking of measurement wells, (ii) the provision of measuring instruments\nand data management equipment, and (iii) training in their installation and use. For water quality the\nactivities will consist of upgrading laboratories and equipment for water quality testing. A centralized\ndatabase will be established in WRS/NWRA, using modern software and information technology to\nfacilitate data sharing.\nc. Strengthening of Water Resource Management\n55. This component will consist of two distinct, but interrelated activities: pilot water resource\nmanagement activities, and capacity building through training and demonstrations.\ni. Pilot Water Resource Management\n56. To develop the newly established NWRA into an effective agency with strong links with other\npartner  agencies,  the  Project  will  initially  support  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  water\nresource management plans in two specific river basins. The work, to be done by NWRA staff in\ncooperation with all concerned parties will entail practical exercises in the type of activity that NWRA\nwill be expected to undertake as a full-fledged, operational agency. The activities will be both a\ntraining exercise and a practical exercise in the resolution of real water use problems. They will\nconsist  of  resource  inventories  (including  fisheries  and  wildlife  aspects);  institutional  analysis;\nproblem and conflict identification; consultations among and between major involved agencies and\nusers; analysis of future use and demand projections, with special attention to long-term demand for\nan urban water supply; the setting up of an institutional framework to resolve water issues; public\nawareness campaigns and public consultations. The work  will eventually result in conflict resolution\nand agreement between water users on the amount and timing of allocations, and other steps that\nmay be identified to resolve water management issues.\n57. The river basins of the Menik Ganga and the Deduru Oya have been chosen as sites for the\nfirst two pilot studies. It is expected that plans setting out water allocation and sharing arrangements\nwill be agreed-upon within three years of commencing the Project (by December 2003), followed by\nimplementation. A third basin, Attanagalu Oya, will be studied at a later stage after additional water\nresources data has been collected.\n58. The resources required to undertake the planning studies will be modest. The Project will\nprovide costs for traveling and field visits, workshops, public information campaigns, and a river\nbasin planning specialist to advise and guide the study teams. These activities will, however be\nintimately connected to the training and demonstration activities for institution building (paras. 59-62)\ninasmuch as it will allow for the identification of the training needs of NWRA and partner agency\n                                                \n19  One component of part B, the construction of low-flow measuring weirs, will also be closely connected to this\ncomponent.", "14\nstaff,  and  installation  of  small  facilities  to  demonstrate  pilot  implementation  of  water  resource\nmanagement and planning.\nii. Training and Demonstrations for Institution Building\n59. Integrated  water  resources  management,  based  on  the  concept  that  water  is  a  limited\nresource that must be conserved and shared, is a relatively new concept in Sri Lanka.  The country\nis seriously short of the expertise needed to ensure that effective water resources planning can be\ncarried out. There is need for people with skills in resource inventory, interdisciplinary coordination\nand planning, long-term monitoring, social impact assessment, conflict resolution and negotiation,\npublic awareness campaigns, resource management legislation, environmental impact assessment,\nadministration of water law and entitlements, and economics of resource management.\n60. Training and skills upgrading in all those areas will be needed at all levels if NWRA and its\npartner agencies are to function effectively. Training will be focused on the functional aspects of\nwater resource management, which have been identified through previous technical assistance,\nand, in particular, on those functions that will be activated through the Project. A significant portion of\ntraining will be directed to the partner agencies that will work with NWRA through agreed-upon\nsharing  of  functional  responsibilities.  The  final  details  of  the  training  program  will  depend  on\ncompletion of a training needs assessment and a survey of training opportunities and modalities.\nThe training program must be flexible to accommodate emerging issues and needs and to allow\nagencies and other stakeholders (universities, water user groups, etc.) to identify training needs in\nresponse to their priorities. For example, the training needs assessment for NWRA will have to be\ncoordinated with its staff recruitment plan.\n61. The  Project  will  provide  funding  for  a  demand-driven  training  program,  based  on  the\nsubmission  of  training  proposals  by  NWRA  and  its  partner  agencies,  and  other  involved\nstakeholders20 on a continuing basis over the life of the Project. Small-scale physical demonstrations\nto implement basin plans, such as installation of measuring devices or modifications to existing\nstructures to calibrate them for measuring flows, will also be funded. Training and demonstration\nproposals  and  their  justification  will  be  prepared  by  NWRA  and  its  partner  agencies  with  the\nassistance of training and other specialists financed by the Project. The proposals will then be\nsubmitted to a technical evaluation committee within NWRA for examination and then, if deemed\nworthwhile, to a senior panel for final approval.21 Components of the training and demonstration\nprogram will be submitted to ADB for approval as they are developed. Following training, the staff\nwill be assigned to relevant positions or tasks wherever possible. The proposed training program,\nincluding a list of suggested selection criteria for training, is described in Appendix 6. The criteria\nprovide for gender balance in the selection of participants.\n62. Training is envisaged to cover both international and national long- and short-term academic\ncourses, tailor-made courses (both local and international), on-the-job training by international and\ndomestic experts or approved NGO groups, and secondment of selected personnel to relevant\noperational agencies such as functioning water management authorities in developed and regional\ncountries. Some of this training and related technical advice will be provided through a long-term\ntwinning relationship between NWRA and a parallel water management agency in another country.\nThis twinning relationship will facilitate the provision of very practical, targeted training relating to\nspecific water management functions and tasks. It will also allow greater flexibility in responding to\nemerging technical issues and training needs on a rapid-response and well-informed basis.\n                                                \n20  Note that while the training opportunities will be available to all related stakeholders (NGOs, community groups,\nacademic institutions, etc.), training proposals will be submitted in consultation with the related agency.\n21  A suitable panel being considered by the Government is the NWRA Board.", "15\n2. Infrastructure for Water Resource Management (Part B)\n63. Part B will be of the construction of the Kelani Conservation Barrage for water level control\nnear  the  intake  for  the  Colombo  water  supply  treatment  plant  at  Ambatale  together  with  the\nconstruction of low-flow measuring weirs, including one on the Kelani River to guide the operation of\nthe barrage.\na. Kelani Conservation Barrage\n64. The barrage will have an adjustable crest that can be raised and lowered to control the water\nlevel at the treatment plant intake.  This need arises because the progressive lowering of the river\nlevels due to excessive sand mining and the decline of river discharges in recent times has caused\nthe intake of saline water by the plant and reduced the extraction rates due to lower pumping\nefficiency. The barrage will enable water levels to be raised and maintained at the original design\nlevels during the dry season. It will thus restore the original pumping capacity and also prevent the\nintake of saline water. In practice, the crest of the barrage will be raised only at critical times of the\nyear, when low flows in the months between February and May could otherwise mean disruption in\nthe water supply due to low water levels and saline intrusion. As an adjustable structure used\nsparingly and at critical times when contamination of the city's water supply looks imminent, it will not\nnormally interfere with either the flows or the use of the river. Without the barrage, the ever-present\ndanger  is  that  the  water  supply  to  the  whole  of  Greater  Colombo  (nearly  2  million  persons,\nthousands of businesses, and hundreds of industries) could be severely reduced or cut off for\nseveral days at a time. The only viable alternatives that could be completed within the urgent time\nframe are (i) to move the intake and water treatment plant further upstream; (ii) to pump from a\nneighboring basin, at considerable expense; or (iii) to operate upstream hydropower reservoirs and\nconsumptive  water  diversions  to  significantly  increase  flows  in  the  lower  river.  All  of  these\nalternatives would involve significantly higher costs.\nb. Low-Flow Weirs\n65. This component will finance the installation of small, fixed-crest weirs to allow accurate and\nreliable measurement of low flows in critical rivers at critical times. This is essential for effective\nmanagement of the water resources, and for the effective operation of the Kelani Conservation\nBarrage during the dry season. Provision is made for the installation of six low-flow weirs at various\nlocations in the western rivers around Colombo. Although they are relatively expensive, the weirs\nprovide a definite and secure solution for achieving accurate measurement of low flows by stabilizing\notherwise variable river conditions. It is recognized that cheaper nonstructural solutions requiring\nregular flow measurements at short intervals may be appropriate at some sites instead of the weirs,\nor there may be more efficient sites for the weirs. Hence the program will be reviewed in further\ndetail during implementation and the Executing Agency and ADB will agree on modifications prior to\nimplementation.\nC. Cost Estimates\n66. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $28.2 million equivalent. The foreign exchange\ncost is estimated at $14.8 million, or about 52 percent of the total, including $0.5 million for interest\nduring construction (IDC) under the ADB loan. The local currency cost is $13.4 million equivalent, or\nabout 48 percent of the total, including $1.2 million for IDC on the amount onlent to NWSDB (para.\n68). The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1. Further details and the scheduling are shown in\nAppendix 7.", "16\nTable 1:  Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currencyd Cost\nA. Base Costa\n1.

Financing Plan\n67. The Government requested ADB to provide a loan of $19.7 million equivalent from its Special\nFunds resources to finance about 70 percent of the total project cost. The loan will finance $14.8\nmillion of the foreign exchange cost (including IDC of $0.5 million), and $4.9 million equivalent of the\nlocal currency cost. The financing of local costs would cover the costs relating to equipment and\nmaterials, consulting services, and part of the civil works, all excluding duties and taxes, and the\ncosts of project management. The Government will finance the remaining costs of $8.5 million\nequivalent (Table 2). The Government has indicated that it wishes to arrange cofinancing through a\nbilateral grant to cover at least some of the services under the twinning arrangements (para. 62).22\n                                                \n22  A proposal for the cofinancing has been prepared and potential sources have been approached. For the purpose of\nappraisal, the financing plan assumes no cofinancing since no firm cofinancing has been identified, and is unlikely to\nbe for some time.", "17\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total Percent\nSource Exchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development Bank 14.8 4.9 19.7 70\nGovernment - 8.5 8.5 30\nTotal 14.8 13.4 28.2 100\n68. The proposed ADB loan will have a repayment period of 32 years, including an 8-year grace\nperiod, and will carry an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent thereafter. The Borrower will be the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Through a\nsubsidiary financing agreement for onlending, the Government will make available to NWSDB the\nADB loan proceeds relating to the construction of the Kelani Conservation Barrage. It was agreed\nthat conditions for the onlending will be on the basis of a 50:50 mix of loan and grant,23 and the loan\nwill be for a term of 24 years with a grace period of 2 years and an interest rate of 12 percent per\nannum, in line with current ADB practice. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk, which\nis covered by the interest rate for onlending.\nE.  Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Management\n69. Part A will be implemented under the direct supervision and guidance of the director general\nof the WRS (subsequently NWRA once established).  The director general will be given appropriate\nauthority to implement the Project and will set up and head a core implementation team comprising\nthe senior NWRA staff and long-term consultants to (i) supervise the implementation of the physical\nestablishment of WRS/NWRA, (ii) supervise the provision of funds to partner agencies for the\nimplementation of the database improvement component,  (iii) supervise the implementation of the\npilot studies to prepare water resources management plans, and (iv) supervise the training and\ndemonstration program. In addition, interagency working groups will be set up to oversee and\ncoordinate project activities for each component. To implement the training program, a technical\nteam  will  also  be  appointed  to  review  training  proposals  and  a  senior-level  committee  will  be\nappointed to finalize their approval.  Specific details on the operation of the training program are\nspelled out in Appendix 6.  For database improvement, each Implementing Agency (IA) - (ID, WRB,\nand  NWSDB)  will  designate  a  senior  officer  to  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  their\nrespective subcomponents. Cooperation agreements between WRS/NWRA and the three IAs will\nalso be finalized by 31 May 2001 in advance of key implementation activities.\n70. Part B will be implemented through a project management unit (PMU) to be established in\nNWSDB. A project manager will be appointed prior to loan effectiveness to head this unit, and will be\nprovided with appropriate technical and supporting staff and an operating budget. The design and\nconstruction supervision of the low flow weirs will be undertaken under the guidance of the director\nof the Hydrology Branch of ID. The flow of funds for the low-flow weirs component has been spelled\nout as part of the cooperation agreement between NWSDB and ID.\n                                                \n23  The rationale for giving part of the financing to NWSDB as a grant is the Government\u2019s existing policy to subsidize the\nrural water supply.", "18\n2. Implementation Schedule\n71. The Project will be implemented over five years from December 2000 to December 2005,\nallowing for the full completion of the construction and one year of operation of the barrage, and a\nfive-year operation of the training and demonstrations program. Within this period, it should be\npossible to commence pilot studies on another river basin (Attanagalu Oya) once the first two,\nstarted at the inception of the Project, are successfully under way. An implementation schedule for\nthe Project is presented in Appendix 8.\n3. Procurement\n72. ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for\nProcurement. Equipment and vehicles on a list prepared by WRS/NWRA and the partner agencies\nwill be procured directly by the WRS/NWRA. Equipment for the database improvement component\nwill  be  procured  by  WRS/NWRA,  from  a  list  of  requirements  provided  by  the  IAs  (ID,  WRB,\nNWSDB).  Equipment  packages  costing  $100,000-$500,000  may  be  procured  by  international\nshopping, except that direct purchase with prior approval from the ADB may be permitted for\nspecialized  proprietary  equipment.  Equipment  packages  costing  less  than  $100,000  may  be\nprocured through direct purchase. Indicative procurement packaging is shown in Appendix 9.\n73. Consumables for part A (travel costs, workshop expenses, etc. especially for the pilot water\nbasin studies) will be purchased by NWRA on a reimbursable basis. The contracts for minor amount\nof civil works will be undertaken through local competitive bidding with ADB\u2019s prior approval of the\nprocedures.\n74. Procurement for the training program will vary, depending on the type of training to be\nprovided. Prior ADB approval will be obtained for expenditures. For short-course and academic\ndegree training, reimbursement of expenses will apply. Twinning arrangements with water resources\nagencies will be based on selection within the training proposal from a list of prequalified twinning\nagencies, prepared by the training consultants at the inception of the Project. Resource experts for\non-the-job training not covered by twinning arrangements (Appendix 6) will be recruited following\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  All  training  will  be  carried  out  in  ADB  member\ncountries.\n75. Construction of the barrage in part B will be awarded under a single civil works contract. The\ncontractor will be responsible for construction and the supply of all related equipment and materials.\nThis contract will be procured through international competitive bidding.  Minor equipment needed by\nPMU  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase  if  it  costs  less  than  $100,000  and  by  international\nshopping where the procurement package exceeds $100,000.\n76. Each of the low-flow weirs will be constructed under separate civil works packages. The size\nof  the  packages  will  range  from  about  $200,000  to  $400,000  each,  and  will  be  scattered\ngeographically, with implementation spread over about two years. These packages are unlikely to be\nof interest to international firms. Hence, it is proposed that the civil works for the weirs be procured\nthrough local competitive bidding, using procedures acceptable to ADB. There is a strong local\nconstruction industry in Sri Lanka, hence there will be adequate competition among many local\ncontractors considered capable of undertaking this type of work.", "19\n4. Consulting Services\n77. The  Project  will  require  351  person-months  of  quantified  consulting  services:  111  of\ninternational  and  240  domestic.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the use of\ndomestic consultants. Part A will require 78 person-months of international and 174 of domestic\nexpertise for project coordination and implementation assistance, training, institutional reform, policy\nsupport, finance and administration, instrumentation, data and informatics, hydrogeology and river\nbasin planning. The consultants are to be recruited on an individual basis, given that most positions\ncover a broad and diversified range of disciplines. For part B, consulting services will consist of 99\nperson-months\u201433  international  and  66  domestic\u2014for  engineering  design,  construction\nsupervision,  geotechnical  investigations,  contract  administration,  hydrology,  social  and  public\nparticipation, and the environment. A domestic firm in association with an international firm will\nprovide the consulting services. The consultants\u2019 outline terms of reference are in Appendix 10.\n78. In addition, it is estimated that about 40 person-months of international and about 50 of\ndomestic expertise will be required for on-the-job training purposes, depending on the design and\ncontent of the training proposals to be received during project implementation. They will be recruited\non an individual basis.\n79. ADB  has  approved  the  Government  request  that  consultant  recruitment  procedures\n(including shortlisting, inviting proposals, evaluation, ADB concurrence, and contract negotiations),\nmay be done prior to loan effectiveness. This advance action will allow contracts for consulting\nservices to be signed immediately after the proposed loan becomes effective. The Government has\nbeen informed that this approval will not commit ADB to financing the Project.\n5. Operation and Maintenance\n80. The facilities built under part A as well as the low-flow weirs in part B will be maintained and\nused by the agencies for which they are intended, i.e., the building and equipment for NWRA will be\noperated and maintained by NWRA; the surface water data collection network (including the low-\nflow weirs) will be operated and maintained by the Hydrology Branch of ID; and the equipment and\nmonitoring  wells  for  groundwater  monitoring  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by  WRB.  The\nGovernment has given assurances that the recurrent budget of these agencies will be augmented in\npace with the implementation of the Project to allow for efficient O&M. During the project period, the\nprovision of an adequate O&M budget will be monitored by ADB.\n81. The barrage will be operated and maintained by NWSDB since the structure is designed to\nprotect its water intake facilities at Ambatale. NWSDB will establish a permanent line in the annual\nrecurrent  budget  (estimated  at  about  $56,000)  for  this  expense  and  appropriate  funds  will  be\nallocated annually.\n6. Disbursement Procedures\n82. To ensure the timely release of the loan proceeds and counterpart funds and expedite\nproject  implementation,  the  Government  will  open  and  maintain  imprest  accounts  for  both\nWRS/NWRA  and  NWSDB.  These  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in\naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial amount to be deposited in the\nimprest accounts will be based on the estimated expenditure for the first four months of project\nimplementation,  but  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $0.5  million  for  each.  Payments  to  the\ninternational  contractor  for  the  barrage  civil  works  will  be  by  direct  payment  procedures.  The\nstatement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  all  small  payments  and  contracts  under", "20\n$100,000 equivalent (in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook) except that full detailed\naccounting will be required for expenses for the training program.\n7. Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n83. The director general of WRS/NWRA and the PMU project manager of NWSDB will establish\nand maintain the accounts and records of project progress and expenditures in such a manner as to\nfacilitate the identification of income and expenditures related to the Project. Each will be assisted by\nan adequate number of qualified accounting staff, including one accountant each dedicated solely to\nmonitoring project expenses, reimbursement, and accounts.\n84. WRS/NWRA and NWSDB will maintain separate accounts for the Project and ensure that\naccounts and financial statements are audited annually in accordance with sound accounting and\nauditing  principles  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Audited  accounts  and  financial  statements,\ntogether with the report of the auditor, will be submitted to ADB within 12 months of the close of the\nrelated financial year, as per NWSDB present practice in the Third Water Supply and Sanitation\nSector Project (footnote 11). The audited report should include a separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the\nuse of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures.\n85. Each agency involved in the project will prepare quarterly progress reports. For part A, the\nreports will be collated within WRS/NWRA and submitted to ADB. For part B, the project manager of\nPMU will submit the reports directly to ADB. The reports will detail the achievements to date as\nrelated  to  the  implementation  schedule,  targets,  and  plans  for  the  next  reporting  period,  and\nproblems requiring resolution and the steps being taken to resolve them.\n8. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n86. The impact of a project for institution building and resource conservation is expected to be\nbroad  and  long  term  and  identifying  specific  project  beneficiaries  will  be  difficult.  For  Part  A,\nhowever, the recipients of training can give general assessments of performance outputs including\ntheir effectiveness to carry out their assigned tasks once they return to their regular duties.  For the\ndatabase  improvement  component,  the  quality  and  quantity  of  available  data  will  be  a  useful\nmonitoring indicator. In assessing the benefits of the Kelani Conservation Barrage, the impact can\nbe monitored by measuring salinity and water levels below the barrage while it is in operation (during\nlow flow periods), and comparing those with records at the intake. The quality and quantity of water\nreaching domestic users would be a meaningful measuring tool.\n87. Specific benefit monitoring activities will thus include an annual review and evaluation of the\nimplementation and results of the training program, annual reviews of the data collected through the\ndatabase improvement component, and regular monitoring of the quantity and quality of water being\nsupplied to Greater Colombo through the Ambatale pumping station. The training program review\nand an annual review of the database improvement component will be carried out by the Policy and\nPlanning Division of NWRA, while NWSDB will measure water quality and quantity at Ambatale plant\nand at selected consumer sites.\n9. Periodic Reviews\n88. Regular project implementation reviews will be required, and will be supplemented by a\ncomprehensive midterm review of progress within three years of loan effectiveness. That will enable\nthe Government and ADB to make appropriate adjustments to the project design, if necessary. The\nmidterm  review  will  cover  the  overall  status  of  implementation,  with  particular  emphasis  on\nassessing the effectiveness of the basin plans and the training and demonstration program, and the", "21\nsustainability of benefits. It will also look at how the linkages between NWRA and its partner\nagencies  have  developed,  and,  where  applicable,  the  progress  of  institutional  reforms  and\nstrengthening in the partner agencies. There will be a final evaluation of project performance. The\nneed for and scope of the reviews have been discussed and agreed upon with the Government.\nF. The Executing Agencies\n89. Because of the nature of the Project\u2014it entails both institution and sector-wide capacity\nbuilding (part A) and specific project investments (part B)\u2014there will be two Executing Agencies\n(EAs). The EAs and the IAs that will work with them are described in the following paragraphs.\n1. Institutional Development (Part A)\n90. The EA for part A will eventually be NWRA to be established under the National Water\nResources Act. NWRA is expected to be formally established and functioning not later than 31\nDecember 2001 (Appendix 3, Table A3.1). Until then, the WRS, as the existing precursor of NWRA,\nwill be the EA.\n91. The institutional structure of NWRA is spelled out in the National Water Resources Policy\n(Appendix 2). It is envisaged that NWRA will have a staff of 34 professionals and 17 support\npersonnel. It will be under the direction of a board consisting of seven senior officers with sound\nprofessional qualifications and experience related to water resources management. The chairman of\nthe board will report directly to the head of state. Functional divisions of NWRA will consist of a\npolicy and planning division responsible for policy, information management, and planning; a field\nservices division responsible for water entitlements, and community and institutional services; and a\nlegal and administrative division. The proposed organization chart for NWRA is in Appendix 4.\n92. The WRS currently has 12 staff\u20149 professionals and 3 support staff\u2014and is headed by a\ndirector. In its present form, the WRS has, with the assistance of consultants, prepared the policy\nand institutional reform packages. An important function has been to lead the consultation process\nwith all concerned stakeholders, including other agencies, NGOs, and community groups. In the\nprocess, the staff have gained a sound understanding of the objectives of the proposed NWRA. As\nsuch, the current WRS will be able to adequately handle activities during the lead up to the Project\nand also during the initial stages.24 Prior to loan effectiveness, the WRS will be strengthened with\nthe appointment of an interim board (chairman and three board members), the director general, and\nthree directors (all positions as proposed for NWRA). Subsequently, staff at the other levels will be\nquickly increased at the commencement of the Project so as to respond to the scheduled activities.\nThe current director of the WRS is likely to be appointed to the position of director general. Subject\nto their satisfactory performance, other WRS staff are expected to be absorbed as permanent staff\nof  NWRA  once  NWRA  becomes  a  legal  entity.  A  NWRA  Establishment  Committee  has  been\nestablished to facilitate staff recruitment and budget provision. A time-bound action plan for staffing\nthe  WRS/NWRA  has  been  agreed  upon  with  the  Government  (Appendix  3,  Table  A3.2).  This\nadequately facilitates the project start-up under the WRS and a smooth transfer of responsibilities to\nNWRA.\n93. Regarding the ability of the WRS and NWRA to act as EAs, it may be noted that WRS has\nalready functioned as EA for two major ADB-financed TAs of over $1.0 million each. Current staff\nare therefore familiar with ADB procurement and operational procedures. In addition, it can be safely\nassumed that many NWRA staff will come from existing water resources agencies (e.g., NWSDB,\nMASL, ID, and CEB), which have extensive experience in implementing projects financed by either\n                                                \n24  There is ongoing assistance under TA 2422-SRI and TA 3030-SRI (para. 2)  to aid the WRS with this task.", "22\nADB  or  the  World  Bank.  They  too  will  be  experienced  in  the  operational  aspects  of  the\nimplementation of multilaterally funded projects.\n94. These implementation arrangements contain the inherent risk that, for one reason or another\nand  despite  the  best  intentions  of  the  Government,  NWRA  will  not  be  established  or  its\nestablishment  will  be  inordinately  delayed.  As  a  contingency  against  this  eventuality,  the\nGovernment has agreed that if NWRA is not functioning by 31 December 2001, disbursements\nunder the loan may be suspended. The Government has also agreed that, prior to establishment of\nNWRA, no contracts will be awarded without ADB approval (Appendix 9). In particular, civil works\ncontracts under part B will not be awarded, and expenditure and/or commitments under the training\nand demonstration component in part A will not exceed $100,000. The contracts for consulting\nservices will also provide for their automatic termination by the Government within 90 days after the\nagreed-upon deadline for the establishment and functioning of NWRA (31 December 2001) fails to\nmaterialize (Appendix 8).\n95. Several partner agencies will be involved in part A: ID, MASL, WRB, NWSDB, CEA, CEB,\nprovincial councils and district authorities in selected pilot basins, and others. All are expected to\nplay a role, to varying extents, in implementing the database improvement component, participate in\nthe  pilot  water  resources  planning  studies,  and  participate  in  the  demand-driven  training  and\ndemonstration program. Three of the partner agencies will be IAs, responsible for implementing the\ndatabase improvement component. The ID will be the major IA for the surface water aspects of the\ncomponent, WRB will be the IA for the groundwater aspects of (including groundwater quality) and\nNWSDB will be the IA for the surface water quality aspects. MASL will be a major contributor in\ndeveloping a centralized database.\n2.   Infrastructure for Water Resource Management (Part B)\n96. The EA for part B will be NWSDB, a competent EA as demonstrated in the course of\nimplementation of earlier ADB-financed projects. NWSDB is the national water utility and has about\n8,000 employees. Its headquarters are in Colombo, and it has five regional resource centers and a\nnumber of district offices throughout the country. It has a board of directors with a full-time chairman\nand a general manager. The daily water production of NWSDB is about 800,000 cubic meters (m3),\nserving  320,000  domestic  and  45,000  nondomestic  connections.  Its  annual  development\nexpenditure is around SLRs3 billion ($51 million), and operational expenditures, met from its own\nrevenues,  are  around  SLRs2  billion  ($34  million).  Twenty  percent  of  its  staff  are  involved  in\ndevelopment and 80 percent in operations.\n97. NWSDB will be directly responsible for the design, construction and operation of the Kelani\nConservation Barrage, which falls well within the board\u2019s mandate as an agency supplying water to\nthe urban area of Greater Colombo. Consultants will be engaged to take responsibility for design\nand construction supervision of the barrage. In addition, NWSDB will have overall responsibility for\nthe construction of the low-flow weirs. In some cases, the use of the weirs is directly related to the\noperation of NWSDB infrastructure. For example, the low-flow weir at Glencorse on the Kelani River\nwill be necessary for the effective operation of the barrage. In other cases, the data obtained from\nthe weirs will be used by NWSDB for future operational planning. However, the design, construction\nsupervision, and operation of the weirs for data collection will be the responsibility of the ID as IA.\n3. Financial Management of Executing Agencies\n98. Since NWRA is a new agency, its establishment will be supported through the Project. To\nensure that financial management capacity is established from the start of the Project, provision has\nbeen made for a domestic finance and administration specialist to work for 30 months with the newly", "23\nrecruited NWRA staff to establish financial systems and procedures, including information systems.\nCurrently, the budgeting and accounting requirements of the WRS are being met by the National\nPlanning Department (NPD) in the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP). This arrangement is\nexpected  to  continue  until  NWRA  is  fully  established.  ADB  recently  funded  the  Financial\nManagement Training Project,25 which sought to improve the efficiency of financial management\nsystems in the public sector. The training infrastructure created under that Project will be available\nfor training the NWRA staff.\n99. The need for NWSDB to improve its financial management has also been recognized and is\nbeing supported through the ongoing Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (footnote\n11).  Over  the  past  three  years,  NWSDB  has  recruited  professionally  qualified  accountants  to\nstrengthen  its  financial  management  capacity,  and  proposes  to  train  its  own  partially  qualified\naccountants through the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. It is also proposed that a\nspecial review of NWSDB accounting systems be conducted, by an international accounting firm, in\nconsultation with the auditor general of Sri Lanka, under a small-scale TA.26\n100. Some delays have been noted in the compliance with some loan covenants of the Third\nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Covenants that require adoption of a national water\npolicy and related legislation are being pursued under the Project. The National Water Resources\nPolicy was adopted in March 2000, one year behind schedule. Preparation of legislation is now in\nprogress and will be supported by the Project. Compliance with other covenants requiring the\nintroduction of private sector participation in the operation of the Greater Colombo water supply has\nalso been delayed. The compliance dates have been rescheduled to allow prior establishment of a\nregulatory body. ADB is assisting the Government with this through a study by ADB staff27 to look at\noptions for private sector participation. In addition, TA 3434 (footnote 26) will provide baseline\ninformation by December 2000 for developing the options. This TA will also strengthen NWSDB\u2019s\nfinancial management to ensure timely compilation and auditing of annual accounts.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n101. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken for the Project and a summary\nIEE is in Appendix 11. The IEE concluded that only minor potential impacts can be expected, and\nthat the required mitigation measures are readily available. A full environmental impact assessment\nis not required. The main environmental concern was the potential impact of the construction of the\nbarrage and the low-flow weirs on the aquatic life in the rivers where the structures will be built.\nSince migratory species are only at risk if their passage is blocked during periods of high flows, at\nwhich time the crest of the barrage will be fully lowered and the low-flow weirs will be submerged,\nsignificant impacts are not expected. Other minor impacts will occur during construction, but they will\nbe  minor  and  temporary  disturbances  for  which  mitigation  measures  are  readily  available.\nConstruction methods for the barrage will use best practices to avoid or minimize disturbance.\n102. The low-flow weirs are meant primarily as a water-monitoring tool. They will be of low profile\nand  require  only  minimal  construction  activity.  Since  they  cause  only  small  height  differential,\nsignificant impacts are not expected. An assessment of one potential location concluded that the\nimpacts would not be significant. However, because the precise locations and designs for the weirs\n                                                \n25  Loan 1275-SRI: Financial Management Training Project, for $13,000,000, approved on 29 November 1993.\n26  TA  3434-SRI: Accounting Review of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, for $100,000, approved on\n10 May 2000.\n27  McIntosh, A.

Asian\nDevelopment Bank, Manila.", "24\nwill not be known until project implementation, IEEs will need to be carried out at that time. The\nGovernment has provided assurances that an IEE will be undertaken and approved by ADB prior to\nthe construction of each individual weir, once its site is finalized. Consulting services included under\nthe Project will carry out that task.\n2. Social Concerns\n103. Only very minor negative social impacts are expected from the Project and measures to\nmitigate are available. Some minor river traffic passing the site of the barrage (mainly log and sand\ntransport) will potentially be disrupted by the construction. To mitigate that, a log transport passage\nhas been built into the barrage design, and construction will be phased so that the river is seldom, if\never, fully blocked to river traffic.  An alternative site for the unloading of sand mining barges will be\nidentified upstream of the barrage.\n104. The Project will require minor temporary land acquisition for use during construction of the\nbarrage (approximately 0.5 ha of privately owned land). There is no settlement on the land, thus no\nhouseholds will be relocated. It is estimated that 5-7 households will be affected through loss of\ncoconut and banana trees. Losses can be minimized by careful siting of the construction works.\nCompensation will be paid according to market price as per the Land Law in Sri Lanka and ADB\u2019s\nHandbook on Resettlement. A Short Resettlement Plan has been prepared, which includes the\nproposed compensation for the losses and procedures for compensation. The EA will settle all\ncompensation prior to construction work. An adequate budget has been provided in the Project to\ncover the cost of temporary land acquisition and loss of other assets.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Economic and Financial Analyses\n105. A summary of the financial and economic analyses is presented in this section; further\ndetails,  including  assumptions,  quantification  of  benefits,  and  sensitivity  analysis,  are  in\nAppendix 12.\n1. Economic Justification\n106. The institutional strengthening of water resource management under part A will bring a\nnumber of nonquantifiable benefits arising from the conservation of scarce water resources. The\nassistance  will  support  the  policy  objective  of  safeguarding  investments  in  water  resources\ndevelopment  and  other  sectors  of  the  economy  by  providing  water  rights  and  entitlements.\nDeveloping a comprehensive, river basin-oriented approach through the pilot studies will ensure a\nhealthy environment and sustainable use of both surface water and groundwater resources.\n107. The economic benefits of the Kelani Conservation Barrage arise from (i) cost savings it\nprovides compared to supplying equivalent raw water volumes from alternative sources in the dry\nseason when saline intrusion is probable without the barrage; (ii) cost savings accruing from the\nimproved efficiency of the existing pumping facilities due to higher river levels in the dry season at\nAmbatale; and (iii) reduced raw water extraction losses at Ambatale in the dry season.\n108. The results of the economic evaluation are presented in terms of (i) the average incremental\neconomic cost (AIEC), and (ii) economic internal rate of return (EIRR). The AIEC measures the\nmarginal economic cost of the incremental volume of raw water provided by the barrage, and has\nbeen calculated as a function of the incremental raw water in the dry season. At a discount rate of\n12 percent, the AIEC has been estimated to be SLRs10.5 per m3, which compares favorably with\nNWSDB\u2019s 1998 average unit cost of SLRs14.6 per m3 for every unit billed. Three future demand", "25\nscenarios were considered in the analysis; low, medium, and high.28 The medium-demand scenario\nis considered most likely. Its base case EIRR was 22.1 percent (ranging from 16.0 percent for the\nlow- to 22.1 percent for the high-demand scenarios). Sensitivity analysis found the EIRRs to be\nrobust: in the worst case for the medium-demand scenario, the EIRR dropped to 12.8 percent when\ncosts increased by 10 percent and benefits lagged by two years, and ranged from 14.5 percent to\n19.3 percent in other cases.\n2.  Financial Justification\n109. The financial implications of the proposed investment in the barrage have been assessed in\nterms of the estimated capital costs, financing requirements, and the potential impact on NWSDB\u2019s\nfinancial operations. As the barrage will not be a profit center in its own right, key cost parameters\nthat will have a direct impact on NWSDB\u2019s future financial projections and commitments have been\nassessed. The financial impact on NWSDB\u2019s performance has been measured in terms of the\npercentage increase in (i) the annual O&M costs (0.1 percent); (ii) depreciation charges (2.1 percent\nper annum); and (iii) interest charges (4.7 percent per annum). To incorporate the cost impact of the\ninvestment, it is estimated that NWSDB\u2019s projected water tariff of SLRs22.6 per m3 in 2005 will need\nto be increased by only SLRs0.3 per m3 (1.3 percent), which is not a significant increase.\nB. Environment\n110. In the long term, the Project will have a distinctly positive environmental impact. The main\nlong-term intent of the Project, particularly part A, is to provide the Government with the capacity to\neffectively manage the country's water resources. This means that in planning future use of water\nresources, environmental considerations will be fully taken into consideration. More specifically,\nduring river basin planning all uses and requirements for water will be taken into account and special\nallocations  can  be  made  for  such  purposes  as  fisheries  or  wildlife  and  to  protect  unique\nenvironmental areas such as wetlands. Furthermore, by taking an integrated and holistic approach\nto planning, it will be possible to ensure the siting of potentially polluting industries in areas where\nthey will do the least amount of environmental damage and to identify where specific mitigation\nmeasures are required.\nC. Social Dimensions\n111. The social impact of the project will, in the short term, be either neutral or very minor (para.\n103).  The  long-term  social  impact  will,  however,  be  significant.  Most  issues  in  water  use  are\nultimately social. Conflicts in water use are primarily conflicts between the use of water by one group\nof people and the use of water by another (or even the demand for different uses by the same\ngroup).  The  conflicts  may  be  manifested  in  the  need  for  domestic  water  versus  the  need  for\nirrigation; the need for watershed protection versus the need for upland dwellers to grow food crops\nand make a living; and the need for garbage and sewage disposal versus the need for fresh drinking\nwater. Planning water use thus entails, to a large extent, the resolution of conflicting or competing\nuses of a limited resource among social groups. Having a mechanism to do that (NWRA, river basin\nplanning committees, the Water Resources Tribunal) ensures that, to the extent possible, each\nsocial group will be able, through a consultative process, to obtain maximum access to water in a\nway that is consistent with the overall social good.\n                                                \n28  The low, medium, and high future demand scenarios assume total raw water extraction will increase by 40, 57, and 75\npercent, respectively, by the year 2025 from the 1999 levels. Incremental extraction per year has been projected\naccordingly.", "26\nD.  Impact on Poverty\n112. The existence of a functioning water resources apex group, along with a mechanism to allow\nconsultation in water allocation, will provide the poorer segments of society with the forum needed to\nenunciate their water resource needs and to ensure that, to some extent, these needs are met.  In\nreal terms, both the rural and the urban poor will have a voice in determining their access to a\nresource essential to their physical and economic well-being and advancement.\n113. About one fifth of Sri Lanka\u2019s population is categorized as poor on the basis of an income\nthreshold of about SLRs720 or $10.1 per person per month. The income is still highly skewed, with\nthe bottom 20 percent of the income earners receiving less than 4 percent, while the top 20 percent\nreceive about 55 percent of the total income. While unemployment in the country is relatively high\n(8.5 percent in 1999), underemployment is more closely linked with poverty. The majority of the poor\nare working in low-productivity occupations in agriculture and fisheries, and 80 percent of them are\nto be found in the rural areas. Poverty is prevalent in the three pilot river basins: Menik Ganga,\nDeduru Oya, and Attanagalu Oya. Since water-related problems are limiting the productivity of the\nrural dwellers, the Project is likely to have an indirect poverty reduction impact in providing water of\nadequate quality and a reliable supply, especially for small farmers.\n114. The Kelani Conservation Barrage will improve water supply in the Greater Colombo area\nwhere  problems  of  supply  interruption  and  low  pressure  exist  mostly  in  areas  of  low-income\nhouseholds in the shantytowns and slums. The socioeconomic profiles of the benefited areas show\nthat almost half of the population are beneficiaries of the Government\u2019s Samurdhi Social Safety Net\nprogram, which targets people below the poverty line. Most of the residents rely on communal stand\nposts for water, with 40-200 households sharing one stand post. After the construction of the\nbarrage, NWSDB will be able to extend and enhance the water supply service in these areas.\nCommunal stand posts will provide more reliable supplies, and there will be an option for private\nconnections. Hence, the quality of life will be enhanced for some 330,000 beneficiaries, and almost\nhalf of them are below the poverty line. The barrage will particularly benefit the poorer women in the\ntarget area who walk and carry water from a distance ranging from 60 to 900 meters. In addition, the\nconstruction of the barrage and the low-flow weirs will create temporary employment for more than\n100 persons.\nE. Risks\n115. The greatest potential risk for the Project is the possibility of a long delay in establishing\nNWRA. This has been assessed, and safeguards have been put in place to ensure that NWRA is\nfully established and functioning effectively not later than the end of 2001. A major milestone in the\nprocess was achieved in March 2000 with Cabinet approval of the National Water Resources Policy\nand Institutional Arrangements. This is considered the first of two crucial steps in the process (the\nsecond  being  passage  of  the  legislation  in  Parliament).  That  approval  demonstrates  the\nGovernment\u2019s strong commitment to the reform process and will substantially reduce the risk of\nmajor delays in further processing of the legislation needed to formally establish NWRA. The risk\nhas been further mitigated by providing a phased action plan with distinct milestones and a phased\nbuildup  of  WRS/NWRA  staff  in  line  with  the  project  activities.  There  is  also  the  risk  that  the\nlegislation will not be passed by Parliament. However, this is considered unlikely, since a process\ninitiated in 1993 of developing participation, ownership, and consensus of the reform package\namong all stakeholders has ensured that the related legislation is no longer politically sensitive.\n116. For  implementation  activities,  the  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  few.  Consulting\nservices have been provided in critical areas of project coordination, institutional reform, water\nlegislation, basin planning, data and informatics, and finance and administration. They will support\nthe existing and newly appointed staff of WRS/NWRA to implement project activities on schedule.", "27\nNWSDB has a good record as EA. In the area of financial management, improvements are already\nbeing comprehensively addressed (paras. 98-100).\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n117.

POLICYa\nA. Water Resources Policy Foundation\n1. A number of warning signs point to increasing water resource problems in Sri Lanka.\nCompetition and water shortages will increase as a result of a highly variable rainfall and a\ngrowing  demand  for  water.  The  degradation  of  watersheds  is  resulting  in  sedimentation  of\nreservoirs and more serious floods and droughts.  Water pollution from domestic, agricultural, and\nindustrial sources is contaminating surface water and groundwater and affecting public health.\nGroundwater is being overextracted in some areas, affecting its availability to others and for\nenvironmental values.\n2. Policy objective. The objective of water resources management is to ensure the use of\nwater  resources  in  an  effective,  efficient,  and  equitable  manner,  consistent  with  the  social,\neconomic, and environmental needs of present and future generations. Additional objectives are\nto\n(cid:1)  facilitate national development;\n(cid:1)  conserve scarce water resources and recognize their value;\n(cid:1)  ensure equitable sharing of water resources to meet current and future demands of\nthe population through an efficient allocation system;\n(cid:1)  recognize the national importance of water allocation to the irrigation sector in terms of\nsuch things as the amount of water allocated, number of users, and potential for\nimproved water conservation;\n(cid:1)  ensure the flexibility of water allocation in a way that promotes social harmony and\nindividual decision making;\n(cid:1)  safeguard  investments  in  water  resources  development  and  other  sectors  of  the\neconomy by providing water rights and entitlements;\n(cid:1)  improve standards in the maintenance of the safe quality of sources for various water\nuses; and\n(cid:1)  ensure  a  healthy  environment  and  sustainable  use  of  both  surface  water  and\ngroundwater resources through a comprehensive, river basin-oriented approach.\n3. Scope and policy principles. The National Water Resources Policy applies to all fresh\nand brackish water in Sri Lanka. It does not apply to marine water. All surface water and\ngroundwater are owned by the State and managed by the government in partnership with water\nusers  on  behalf  of  all  Sri  Lankans.  Water  will  be  managed  in  a  sustainable  manner  while\nobserving efficiency, equity, and environmental objectives. Sri Lanka will take an open and\nparticipatory approach to water resources management and will base decisions on strong and\ncoordinated resource information.\nB. Water Rights and Allocation\n4. Until now Sri Lanka has not had a formal or adequate water allocation system. To a\ncertain  extent,  conflicts  have  been  resolved  through  interagency  agreement.  However,  the\nallocation mechanisms have failed to ensure water allocation that recognizes the rights of existing\nusers and flexibility to meet the needs of new users. Under the policy, water is allocated on the\n                                                          \na      This summary is a condensed version of the summary as it appears in the official policy document approved by the\nCabinet in March 2000.", "34\nAppendix 2, page 2\nbasis  of  agreed-upon  priorities,  and  in  accordance  with  principles  of  economic  efficiency.\nEnvironmental and small-scale social users will not suffer at the expense of larger, consumptive\nusers.\n5. Entitlements. The right to use water will be granted through water entitlements. Small-\nscale users and individual water users supplied through group schemes will be exempt from the\nrequirement to hold an entitlement. Entitlements will be granted for a fixed period of time, based\non the specific water use. Water user compliance with the terms of their entitlements will be\nmonitored and enforced.\n6. Environmental and social water requirements. Minimum flows and storage volumes of\nwater will be specified to ensure a supply for environmental, social, and cultural water uses. The\nreservation will be made before water entitlements are issued.\n7. Water allocation priorities. Water will be reserved to protect small-scale water users, for\nother social and cultural purposes, and for environmental values. Water entitlements will be\nissued to existing water users and, to the extent that further water is available, to new applicants.\nDuring periods of drought, the first priority will be domestic use. Other water users will share the\navailable supply in proportion to their normal entitlements.\n8. Transfers. Voluntary transfers of water entitlements will be allowed between entitlements\nholders or from entitlement holders to those seeking to acquire water use rights. Transfers will be\nsubject to approval under approved guidelines so as to protect third parties and environmental\nvalues.  Transfers will normally involve compensation paid by the new entitlement holder.\nC. Demand Management\n9. Transferable water entitlements. Making water entitlements transferable will promote\nwater conservation and improved water allocation.\n10. Water management cost sharing.  Basin  water  resource  management  costs  will  be\nshared with water users in a transparent manner. The bases for cost sharing are the entitlement\nholder\u2019s quantity of water use, ability to pay, and the consumptive or nonconsumptive nature of\nthe holder\u2019s water use. Information on the value of water for different types of use will be reflected\nin the basin plans. The government will pay the current share of water management costs for the\nirrigation sector through a transparent subsidy, in recognition of the low level of returns in this\nsector. As returns for irrigated agriculture grow in the future with improved irrigation system\ncontrol and maintenance and more reliable water delivery, it is expected that the irrigation sector\nwill have a greater ability to share in the cost of water resource management.\n11. Regulatory  control,  water  saving,  and  education.  Water  entitlements  will  be  an\nimportant  tool  in  demand  management  since  unauthorized  water  use  will  be  controlled.\nEntitlements may also contain terms and conditions regarding water conservation measures,\nwhich  entitlement  holders  must  implement.  Water  conservation  agreements  may  also  be\ndeveloped to specify more general water conservation activities or those falling outside the scope\nof  water  entitlements.  Water-measuring  devices  will  be  required  as  a  condition  for  water\nentitlements. Water-saving technology and research will be promoted. Public education and\nawareness programs will be used to develop awareness of the value of water resources and of\nactivities that can be taken to conserve water. Water resource managers will be trained to\nimprove water use efficiency through their own actions and in cooperation with water users.\nTechnical assistance on water conservation will be given to users on request.", "35\nAppendix 2, page 3\nD. Groundwater Management\n12. Groundwater  is  widely  used  for  domestic,  small-scale  irrigation,  industrial,  and  other\npurposes in Sri Lanka. There are many types of shallow and deep groundwater aquifers; each\nhas its own characteristics and management needs. In addition to providing a ready source of\nwater for consumptive purposes, shallow aquifers play an important role in discharging water to\nrivers and other water bodies during low flow periods. They also support wetlands and native\nvegetation.\n13. The  major  groundwater  issues  relate  to  the  fact  that  groundwater  is  essentially  an\nunregulated resource. Ownership and management responsibilities for it are not clearly defined.\nAlthough studies have been conducted and well-drilling data collected, there have been no\nongoing  monitoring  and  coordinated  information  system  for  groundwater.  Intensive  urban,\nindustrial, tourism, and other developments have contributed to over-use and contamination of\nsome aquifers. Subsidy programs to promote the development of shallow \u201cagro-wells\u201d have also\nresulted in heavy use of shallow groundwater in parts of North Central and North Western\nProvinces.\n14. The rate of groundwater replenishment and other distinctive features of aquifers will be\ntaken into account in groundwater planning and management. Its management will take a long-\nterm perspective. Surface water and groundwater, particularly in shallow aquifers, are closely\nrelated resources. They must therefore be managed in an integrated manner. All policies applied\nto surface water will also apply to groundwater management. In areas where there are special,\nurgent groundwater issues, planning and management of groundwater may go ahead without full\nriver basin planning. Small users will be exempt from the requirement to hold entitlements, but\nlocal governments will be encouraged to register small wells and to apply guidelines on well\ndensity in groundwater management areas. Information on groundwater and water conservation\nwill be disseminated to groundwater users.\nE. Information Management\n15. Water  resources  data  and  information  are  needed  for  effective  water  resource\nmanagement.  The  essential  information  includes  policy  development  and  planning,  water\nmanagement operations, project planning, public awareness and education, and the investment\nplanning. However, the data and the current information system are inadequate in terms of\nconsistent data standards, accuracy, and accessibility of data and information.\n16. Water resources data collected by national government agencies are the property of the\nstate. Data and information exchange and sharing will be ensured through a series of agreements\nbetween  data  collection  agencies  (custodian  agencies)  and  the  National  Water  Resources\nAuthority (NWRA). The agreements will specify data collection and management standards, data\nand information access and pricing and compilation of data sets by NWRA. In exchange for data\nfrom  the  custodian  agencies,  NWRA  will  undertake  a  coordinated  and  mutually  beneficial\napproach to strengthening the overall data and information system. Overall priorities will be\nidentified in a cooperative manner, and funds accumulated by NWRA through charges for water\ninformation will be used to strengthen the capacities of the custodian agencies. Cooperating\ncustodian agencies will have free access to data from NWRA. Data and information will be made\navailable to water agencies through data sharing arrangements and to the public through both\nactive awareness and educational programs and in response to requests. Consistent pricing of\nwater data and processed water information will be encouraged.", "36\nAppendix 2, page 4\nF. Institutional Structure for Water Resources Management\n17. A  new  and  permanent  National  Water  Resources  Authority,  a  permanent  Water\nResources Council (WRC), and a Water Resources Tribunal (WRT) will be established at the\nnational  level.  These  bodies  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  water  resource\nmanagement and for a number of specified functions. The functions of NWRA will be to\n(cid:1)  prepare a national water resources policy;\n(cid:1)  undertake long-term national and river basin planning, including coordination of local\ninput;\n(cid:1)  coordinate the collection of water resource data and information management, water\nmonitoring and commissioning of research;\n(cid:1)  allocate water through the issuance of water entitlements;\n(cid:1)  advise the government regarding drought and flood management;\n(cid:1)  formulate a policy on and monitor riverine activities; and\n(cid:1)  conduct public information and awareness campaigns.\n18. Reporting relationship and structure. To make them effective in policy development, in\nwater resource planning and regulation, and in dispute resolution, NWRA, WRC, and WRT will be\nneutral  with  respect  to  sector  interests  and  will  have  a  strong  and  authoritative  position  in\ngovernment. These bodies will be parallel in terms of reporting directly to the chief executive of\nthe government (the President of Sri Lanka). Together, the three form the water sector apex\nbody. As such, and in their areas of responsibility, they will be considered to have a level of\nauthority higher than that of other national water agencies.\n19. NWRA will report to a board, which will consist of seven members selected on the basis of\nclearly specified professional qualifications covering a range of water-related specialities. The\nchief executive of NWRA will be the director general. Its internal divisions are expected to be\n(i) policy  and  planning,  (ii)  operations  (water  allocation,  riverine  control,  information),  and\n(iii) corporate services (administration and finance). NWRA will be responsible for coordinating,\nplanning, regulating and monitoring Sri Lanka\u2019s water resources, but will not be responsible for\nplanning,  operating,  and  maintaining  infrastructure;  sectoral  water  delivery;  or  implementing\ncapital projects.\n20. Delegation and contracting out. NWRA will delegate to, or work in partnership with,\nvarious  national,  provincial,  and  other  government  agencies  in  carrying  out  technical  and\ndecentralized functions. Policy development will be the responsibility of NWRA, but an open and\nconsultative approach will be used. The technical aspects of national and river basin planning will\nbe largely delegated or undertaken in partnership with agencies with parallel responsibilities. Data\nand  information  will  be  managed  in  a  decentralized  system  in  which  NWRA  will  serve  as\ncoordinator. NWRA will establish and coordinate the proposed system of bulk water entitlements,\nwith appropriate responsibilities to the provincial, district, or divisional level and with appropriate\ncapacity building and supervision.  Where NWRA lacks technical capacity or staff, it may also\ncontract out tasks to other government agencies or private or nongovernment groups.\n21. Water Resources Council. The Water Resources Council will advise the Minister of\nwater resource issues and on the resolution of interprovincial and interagency water disputes. It\nwill coordinate activities in water resource management at the national level and will review and\nendorse draft policies and national and river basin plans. The membership of WRC will consist of\nthe following:", "  37\nAppendix 2, page 5\n(cid:1)  seven secretaries of national ministries responsible for subjects such as water supply,\nirrigation, agriculture, and hydropower and (on a rotational basis) the subjects of fisheries,\nlands, plantations, industry, environment, finance and planning, provincial councils, and\nsocial issues such as health, education and poverty reduction;\n(cid:1)  heads of the Irrigation Department, Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL), Ceylon\nElectricity Board, and National Water Supply and Drainage Board;\n(cid:1)  nine  nongovernment  representatives:  two  of  private  water  users,  two  of  farmer\norganizations, two of nongovernment organizations active in water resource management,\ntwo  of  academic  institutions  concerned  with  water  resources  (including  their  social\naspects), and one gender representative.\n22. Water  Resources  Tribunal.  The  Water  Resources  Tribunal  (WRT)  will  be  an\nindependent  appeal  tribunal  that  will  resolve  issues  relating  to  the  administration  of  water\nentitlements by NWRA. WRT will be responsible to the Minister for administrative purposes, but\nwill have statutory independence. Its judgments will be final, aside from appeal to the courts on\nmatters of law. WRT will comprise a legally trained chairman assisted by a panel of technically\nqualified persons. Three or more members of the panel will be summoned on an ad hoc basis by\nthe chairman to hear appeals. WRT will face time limits on rendering decisions and will have\nadministrative procedures designed to ensure its efficiency.\n23. Relationship of NWRA, WRC, and WRT to other national agencies. NWRA, WRC, and\nWRT  will  together  form  the  water  sector  apex  body  responsible  for  coordinating,  planning,\nregulating and monitoring national water resources and resolving disputes in the water sector. In\ntheir areas of responsibility, they will be considered to have a level of authority higher than that of\nother national water agencies. The other agencies will all be subject to the oversight and direction\nof NWRA, WRC, and WRT.\n24. Provincial and river basin water resources administration. River basin and major\naquifer planning will be coordinated and technically supported by NWRA and partner agencies.\nPriority river basins and aquifers will be identified for planning and management on the basis of\nwater  management  issues  and  officially  declared  as  \u201cwater  management  areas\u201d  and\n\u201cgroundwater sensitive areas.\u201d\n25. River basin committees or groundwater committees will be established in declared areas.\nThe committees will be responsible for identifying water management issues and preparing terms\nof  reference  for  plans.  They  will  review  draft  plans  prepared  by  NWRA,  conduct  public\nconsultation with the basin or aquifer area, recommend changes to NWRA, and monitor the\nimplementation of plans. They will also review the implementation of river basin plans annually\nand  will  report  to  WRC.  River  basin  and  groundwater  committees  will  be  composed  of\nrepresentatives of national water resources agencies, provincial and other levels of government,\nand water users.\n26. MASL,  like  other  water  management  agencies,  will  be  subject  to  the  national  water\nresources policy and river basin plans approved by WRC and the government, and to guidance,\ncoordination,  and  dispute  resolution  by  NWRA,  WRC,  and  WRT.  NWRA  will  delegate\nresponsibilities and powers to MASL, or utilize the capabilities of MASL through partnership\narrangements.  Delegation of regulatory responsibilities will be subject to the clear separation of\nregulatory and water use functions within MASL.", "  38\nAppendix 3, page 1\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY\nTable A3.1: Milestones in the Legal Establishment of\nNational Water Resources Authority\nMilestone Process Estimated Estimated Date\nTime Earliest Latest\nRequired\nApproval of Completed and October 1999\nNational Water submitted through the\nResources Policy Ministry of Finance and\nby the Water Planning for Cabinet\nResources consideration\nCouncil (WRC)\nCabinet approval Completed, including March 2000\nof Policy approval to forward the\nPolicy to legal draftsman\nLaw drafted and Policy will be converted 7-8 months October 2000 November 2000\nratified by WRC to legislation, based on\ndraft Water Resources\nAct already prepared.\nProcess will involve\ndrafting by legal\ndraftsman, constitutional\nreview, and translation.\nConsultation on Consultation with 3-4 months January 2001 March 2001\ndraft Law affected ministries and\nother major\nstakeholders\nCabinet approval Cabinet approves draft 1-2 months February 2001 May  2001\nto table law in legislation before being\nParliament tabled in Parliament.\nMinistry comments will\nalready be incorporated.\nLaw tabled in Parliamentary agenda 1 month March 2001 June 2001\nParliament will be considered\n(Parliamentary\nelections, timing of\ndebate on national\nbudget).

Rationale\n1. Integrated  water  resources  management  and  the  sharing  of  water  rights  constitute  a\nrelatively  new  discipline  in  Sri  Lanka  and  require  expertise  and  concepts  not  always  readily\navailable or widespread locally. For the National Water Resources Authority (NWRA) to function\neffectively, it will need expertise and training in water resources planning and management and in\nthe management, duties, and operation of an apex water authority, not just for its personnel, but\nalso for the personnel of partner agencies and the local government departments with which\nNWRA is likely to work and interact.\n2. Some of the training needs in this respect, particularly within NWRA itself, will be readily\nidentifiable and it will be possible to formulate some part of a training program at the outset of loan\nimplementation  or  even  prior  to  commencement  of  the  Project.  However,  determining  and\nprioritizing the training needs of eight partner agencies, plus local government agencies, in a\ndiscipline that is not as yet fully understood in Sri Lanka will be very difficult over a four- to five-year\ntime horizon. It is thus desirable to have a maximum amount of flexibility within the training\nprogram to (i) allow training needs to be prioritized and addressed as and when they are identified,\nand (ii) to give agencies time to identify and formulate their training needs as their responsibilities\nbecome clear during the initial years of operation of NWRA.\n3. A demand-driven training component has been designed. It will allow each agency involved\nin the Project to bid for training funds through a series of training proposals prepared with the\nassistance of training specialists and evaluated on technical merit by a neutral body of experts.\nAppropriate safeguards and monitoring mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that the funds\nare effectively utilized and accounted for. The scope, cost and implementation arrangements for\nsuch a training program are in the following sections.\nB.  Scope and Cost\n4. The training program will focus on building up long-term expertise in the agencies involved\nin the implementation of the National Water Resources Act. It will require expertise in water\nresource  inventory  and  assessment,  water  management  policy,  water  quality,  social  impact\nassessment, social mobilization, interdisciplinary coordination, conflict resolution and negotiation,\ncreation  of  public  awareness,  resources  management  legislation,  environmental  impact\nassessment, the economics of resource management, planning skills, resource monitoring, and the\nmanagement of a water resource authority.\n5. The training program will take the form of a whole range of activities including\n  (i)  short-term international courses at relevant institutes for junior and middle-level\npersonnel  of  NWRA  ,  its  partner  agencies,  and  selected  personnel  from  local\ngovernment agencies;\n(ii) secondment to twinning agencies (primarily water resources agencies overseas,\nwhich are willing to take on and train candidates from Sri Lankan  water resources\nagencies);", "44\nAppendix 6, page 2\n(iii)  academic training overseas and in-country, on-the-job training by international and\ndomestic experts, and especially formulated courses given locally;\n(iv)   support  to  local  academic  institutions  to  orient  their  training  programs  toward\nsustainable, long-term training of water resource managers; and\n(v)   public  awareness  and  community  education  targeted  to  water  users  and\nstakeholders  to  enable  them  to  participate  more  effectively  in  enhanced  water\nmanagement activities.\n6. Some training in areas related to water resource management is already offered in Sri\nLanka. The University of Moratuwa has initiated a postgraduate engineering program in water\nresource management, and several universities offer undergraduate programs in water-related\ndisciplines. However, there are gaps in the current training programs and the major need \u2013\npractical training in the various water management functions \u2013 has not been addressed.  The\nimportant  water  management  functions  have  been  identified  under  the  Western  River  Basin\nProject1 and agency responsibilities and partnerships have been outlined.  However, training needs\nhave not been assessed, nor has a plan for local and international training been developed. The\nWater  Resource  Management  Project  will  address  these  needs  and  implement  the  training\nactivities, while at the same time responding to emerging water resource management and related\ntraining needs.\n7. Training is anticipated to take place in two waves. At the inception of the Project, the\nimmediate and already evident training needs will be inventoried and suitable training proposals\nwill be prepared and funded. The proposals are likely to entail short- and medium-term academic\ntraining in-country and overseas. Then, as NWRA begins to operate and the pilot water resources\nmanagement studies get under way, new and more specific training requirements will be identified.\nThese requirements will be met through new proposals, which are envisaged to entail a greater\ndegree of secondment to twinning agencies and on-the-job training, and purpose-designed training\ncourses to meet specific needs.  This second wave of training will most likely take place in years 3\n- 5 of project implementation.\n8. Consultants will be recruited (i) to assist the participating agencies to identify and quantify\ntheir training needs, identify training opportunities, prepare training proposals; and (ii) to assist in\nmonitoring training effectiveness. There will be one international training specialist for 14 person-\nmonths and two domestic training specialists for a total of 36 person-months.\n9. In addition to training, the program will include a range of demonstrations in water resource\nmanagement. These are intended to provide for small physical works that relate to implementation\nof basin plans in the pilot river basins, demonstrating how they can bring about improvements in\ncertain aspects of water management. Demonstration projects may cover the introduction of flow-\nmeasuring structures at off-takes to demand points such as irrigation schemes; modification to\nexisting structures to improve the efficiency of water use or calibration of flow measurement;\nremoval  of  minor  structures  that  are  causing  constraints,  etc.  An  important  aim  of  these\ndemonstrations  will  be to  develop  the  credibility  of  the  basin  plans  by  showing  stakeholders\nphysical improvements, rather than just a set of recommendations in a report.\n10. The demonstrations are envisaged to be limited to minor physical works valued at not more\nthan about $50,000, and generally much less. They would be identified in the course of the Project,\nand it is not possible to accurately predict their exact nature. An international river basin planner\n                                                     \n1  TA 3030-SRI: Western River Basins Sector Project, for $1.5 million, approved on 11 June 1998.", "45\nAppendix 6, page 3\nwill  assist  to  identify  appropriate  demonstrations,  which  will  then  be  subject  to  vetting  and\nevaluation under the same process as the training proposals.\n11. It has been estimated that a meaningful and effective training and demonstration program\ncan be undertaken at a cost of $4.5 million. This cost estimate is based on an indicative training\nprogram as shown in Table A6 below.\nTable A6: Cost Estimates for an Indicative Training and Demonstration Program\nDescription Cost\n1.

NWRA will control the training and demonstration fund. Each participating agency will\nassess its own needs and prepare proposals with the assistance of the consultants. A technical\ncommittee comprising four senior officers selected on a rotational basis from among the eight\npartner agencies, plus one officer from NWRA, will then evaluate the proposals. The proposals will\nmeet the selection criteria (para. 17) and be presented in a consistent format. Once approved by\nthe technical committee, final approval will be by the NWRA board or another appropriate approval\ncommittee.\n13. To ensure timely implementation of the program, the approval period will be limited to one\nmonth after proposal submission, after which period a written letter will be sent to the applying\nagency to explain why its proposal has not yet been approved or disapproved.", "46\nAppendix 6, page 4\n14. Any agency receiving funds will be required to administer them in a responsible manner.\nThis will involve full financial reporting and accounting at the end of the implementation period as\nwell as the submission of a report upon completion. Noncompliance with the financial monitoring\nand  reporting  requirements  will  be  grounds  for  disapproval  of  future  proposal  submissions.\nCompliance will be monitored periodically by the consultants and reported to the Water Resources\nCouncil and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nD. Twinning Arrangements\n15. It is anticipated that some of the project training activities will be implemented through the\nmodality of a long-term twinning relationship between NWRA and a parallel agency in another\ncountry. The objective of this relationship will be to provide access to very practical, applied\ntraining and advisory services that cannot be located through normal academic or commercial\nconsulting channels. Water resource management involves a number of specialized planning and\nadministrative  responsibilities,  with  accompanying  legal  and  public  administration  aspects  (for\nexample,  implementation  of  a  water  licensing  and  allocation  system).  Therefore,  a  parallel\noperational water management agency, which also has the capability to provide on-the-job training\nand consulting support, should be identified and arrangements developed to access these services\nfor the benefit of NWRA and its partners.\n16. NWRA, with the support of the training consultants, will be responsible for identifying\nsuitable foreign water management agencies and the training and advisory services that can be\nprovided through a twinning relationship. NWRA will also develop an agreement, to be approved\nby the Government and ADB, for the provision of services under the twinning arrangements over\nthe course of the project.\nE. Selection Criteria\n17. In assessing and prioritizing the training proposals, the technical committee will consider\nthe following criteria.\n(i) To limit the training proposals to a manageable number, the minimal proposal size\nwill be $50,000 (this will mean a maximum of about 100 proposals over the project\nperiod.). Pilot demonstrations should normally cost less than $50,000 each since\nthey are not meant for sizable infrastructure work.\n(ii) Government officers who are candidates for training should normally be permanent\nstaff and selected in accordance with Government guidelines, including the age\nlimits set in the guidelines. Other participants (community representatives, etc.) will\nbe eligible provided they are directly associated with the Project.\n(iii) As  much  as  possible,  a  balance  will  be  maintained  in  the  amount  of  funding\nprovided to each participating agency.\n(iv) Preference in training will be given to middle- and junior-level officers.\n(v) The training program must be well-defined, targeting specific task requirements, and\nnot of a general nature, e.g., candidates to be sent for training must be assigned to\ndesignated, legitimate courses, not just to an institution.\n(vi) Study tours must be designed and supervised by a legitimate training, development,\nor water management agency.", "47\nAppendix 6, page 5\n(vii) All proposals must be directly related to water resources management, and the\ntraining should be at a recognized institution.\n(viii) The expertise developed during training should, as much as possible, be of a nature\nthat can be utilized for further project implementation once the training is completed.\n(ix) Candidates for training should have a direct link with the project or with NWRA and\nits work.\n(x) Training proposals should aim to have at least about 25 percent women candidates.\nProposals  related  to  activities  that  will  further  women's  concerns  will  receive\nadditional favorable consideration.\n(xi)  Government staff will be required to remain in the positions for which they are\ntrained for a minimum time after the training, according to arrangements to be\ndecided by the Government.\nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n18. Training  is  a  critical  part  of  the  reform  process  in  the  water  resource  sector  and  its\neffectiveness  should  be  optimized.  As  much  as  possible,  training  should  be  in  skills  and\ninformation directly applicable to water resource management activities and to implementation of\nthe  government\u2019s  water  resource  policy  through  approved  institutional  arrangements.  Loss  of\nbenefits through poor design of training activities or poor utilization of trained personnel should be\navoided.  It  will  therefore  be  necessary  to  design  and  implement  a  training  monitoring  and\nevaluation program as part of the overall training initiative. NWRA and the training consultants\nshould undertake the development of this monitoring and evaluation program jointly. The results of\nthe evaluation should be reported to the Water Resources Council and to ADB. The following\nindicators are recommended, with additional ones to be developed during the early stages of the\nproject:\n(i)  Selection of trainees. Has selection of trainees been based on clear and well-\nfounded criteria? Is the training activity based on an approved response to a training\nneeds assessment?\n(ii)  Selection and design of training activity. Have training opportunities and modalities\nbeen adequately surveyed? Where appropriate, has training been suitably tailored\nto trainee needs?\n(iii)  Incentives/opportunities  provided  for  trainees  to  implement  results.  Was  a  plan\nprepared  before  training  for  utilization  of  the  training  results?  Are  adequate\nincentives and opportunities given to trainees to implement their new skills and\nknowledge? What training results have been implemented?\n(iv)  Evaluation of training benefits by trainees and their agencies. Have trainees and\ntheir  agencies  evaluated  the  training  benefits?  Have  these  evaluations  been\nforwarded as appropriate?", "48\nAppendix 7\nSCHEDULE OF COST ESTIMATES\n($'000)\nComponent/Subcomponent 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Total\nPart A.

Introduction\n1. This SIEE is a summary of the potential environmental impacts associated with the Project,\nalong with descriptions of corresponding mitigation and monitoring measures.\nB. Description of the Project\n2. The Project is designed to improve the management of water resources in Sri Lanka. It will\nbe implemented in two parts. Part A will support the implementation of policy and institutional\nreforms that the Government has recently approved, which include setting up a new apex body, the\nNational Water Resource Authority (NWRA). Capacity will be build in the NWRA to undertake its day\nto day operations and fulfil its mandate of managing the country\u2019s water resources. This will include\nestablishing linkages with other relevant agencies in the water sector. This will be done through\npractical exercises to resolve existing conflicts in three pilot river basins (para 6), thus demonstrating\nprocedures for integrated river basin management. Part B will construct infrastructure to improve\nwater resource management. The major component will be the Kelani Conservation Barrage to be\nlocated in the lower reaches of the Kelani Ganga. It is designed to protect against disruptions to the\nwater supply for Greater Colombo by preventing saline intrusions to the intakes and maintaining\nacceptable levels in the river to avoid pumping operations being interrupted. A smaller component of\npart B will the installation of low-flow weirs at various points along the main rivers to facilitate\naccurate measurement of low flows needed by NWRA for proper management of water allocations,\nas well as water quality parameters.\nC. Description of the Environment\n3. The SIEE places emphasis on the Kelani Ganga, the site of the Project\u2019s major infrastructure\ncomponent. It is the third largest watershed in Sri Lanka and plays an important role with respect to\nthe country\u2019s overall economy, since it drains the most fertile land in the wet zone and intercepts the\nmost populated and economically important part of the country including the capital Colombo. Flows\nin Kelani Ganga vary widely, according to the season. Annual flood discharges are typically in the\nrange of 800-1500 cubic meters (m3) per second. Dry season flows are dominated by hydroelectric\npower releases from two reservoirs located near the headwaters of the river. The 1-in-50 year low-\nflow in the lower reaches is estimated to average less than 10 m3 per second over a 7-day period.\n4. The water supply intake for Greater Colombo is located at Ambatale, 15 km from the mouth\nof the Kelani Ganga. Although tidal amplitudes at the mouth are low (0.8 metres at spring tide),\nunacceptably high salinity has been detected at the intake. The situation becomes most critical\nduring the dry season months (January to March). In 1992, a prolonged drought meant that regular\nreleases from the reservoirs could not be maintained, and salinity levels at the intake reached\nunacceptable levels. A temporary sandbag barrier had to be constructed downstream of the intake\nto relieve the situation. Excessive sand mining has also reduced the normal river levels causing the\nintake pumps for the water supply to operate well below optimum range, with total shut down\nrequired at times. Although water quality at Ambatale is still well within the standards specified for\ndrinking water with conventional treatment, data shows a trend of increasing pollutant levels over the\nlast two decades. These problems will require a comprehensive and long-term solution.\n5. Fishing in the Kelani Ganga is not a major economic activity of the people living adjacent to\nthe river. About 20\u201325 families fish as a full time income-generating activity during the first six\nmonths of the year in the river estuary. No fish species that move up the river for spawning are\nfound in the Kelani Ganga, although the giant fresh water prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii)", "62\nAppendix 11, page 2\nmoves downstream into brackish water for spawning. The spawning season for this species is from\nJune to August (with peak spawning activity within the two first months) with some low intensity\nspawning activity in November and December.\n6. The three pilot river basins that will be targeted under the Project (the Menik Ganga, Deduru\nOya,  and  Attanagalu  Oya)  are  medium-sized  basins.  All  these  rivers  are  the  main  source  of\ndomestic water supply for the basins\u2019 population and support major economic activities such as\nagriculture, industry, wildlife reserves, and tourism. In the Menik Ganga, there is a major religious\nand cultural site that relies on river flows during August each year, a low-flow period in the river,\nwhen large numbers of tourists come to bathe in the river. All these basins are experiencing stress\non  the  available  water  resources  due  to  uncontrolled  and  competing  uses.  Comprehensive\nmanagement plans are required in each of these basins to resolve the issues.\nD. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Kelani Conservation Barrage\n7. Impacts during the construction stage will largely be temporary in nature. These impacts and\nthe related mitigation measures apply to the following:\n(i) Water quality. Downstream water quality may be somewhat affected by additional\npollution directly from the site, such as from excavation. However, the overall load of transportable\nsolids is not likely to increase significantly as a result of the works. Other sources of potential water\nquality problems could arise from washing of vehicles, equipment, and general cleaning of hard\nsurfaces; the use of chemicals, fuels, and other hazardous materials or toxic liquids; and runoff from\nimproperly controlled latrines, pits, and so on.\n8. The implementation of best practices for site management and monitoring is the single most\nimportant form of mitigation of negative impacts during the construction phase, and would address\npotential water quality impacts in particular. The siting and control of supplies of sand, aggregate,\nand other materials will be properly managed. All piles and stores will be located well clear of the\nriver. Wastewater will be treated prior to disposal. Hazardous wastes such as fuels will be stored in\nproper containers and the containers within bunkered enclosures. On completion of the works, the\ncontractor\u2019s  site  will  be  leveled  and  rehabilitated.  To  ensure  that  the  contractor  complies  with\nstandard best practices, payments will be keyed to the proper implementation of these practices in\nthe contract documents.\n(ii) Fisheries and other biological resources. The biological/ecological aspects of the\nproject area are not expected to change in any significant way from the without-project situation\n(iii) Health and safety. No significant impacts due to the presence of the workforce are\nenvisaged. The movement of heavy vehicles during construction may cause some traffic nuisance.\nSimilarly, there will be noise nuisance from the construction site. Worker health and safety could be\naffected if standard practices are not followed. The workforce will be small, and many unskilled\npositions will be filled by local people.\n9. Standard mitigation measures will be employed to minimize or avoid potential impacts. The\ncontractor\u2019s labor force will be required to maintain safe speeds. Noise-generating equipment will be\nfitted with mufflers and other sound insulation devices. Working hours will be set so as to minimize\nor avoid noise disturbance during evenings. The contractor will prepare and implement a health and\nsafety plan.", "63\nAppendix 11, page 3\n(iv) Site access. A new, small road spur will be required on the right bank to allow\nvehicles direct access to the site. This may involve minor compensation requirements (see [v]). In\naddition to the safety requirements earlier noted, road construction will employ best practices to\navoid erosion and drainage problems.\n(v) Resettlement and compensation. Resettlement and compensation requirements\nwill be small. The major construction lay-down area will be within the existing compound of the\nNational Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) on the left bank. A smaller area of less than\none half of a hectare will be required on the right bank, and will involve temporary acquisition of land\nand other assets, including minor losses of coconut, banana, and cassava. Approximately 5-7\nhouseholds will be affected, but no permanent relocation is expected. Procedures for compensation\nhave been identified and described in a separate, brief resettlement plan.\n10. Impacts and mitigation measures during the implementation stage are expected to cover the\nfollowing:\n(i) Water quality. Implementation and operation of the barrage will not pose a problem\nto the intake water quality from the impoundment for low-flows with a return period of 10 years or\nless. However, in extreme low-flow events, there may be a risk to the intake water quality due to\nconcentration of pollutants, and the \u2018first flush\u2019 condition after an extended period of low flow may\ntemporarily pollute the immediate downstream stretches of the river. Low-flow retention by the\nbarrage will mean that downstream of Ambatale, dilution and dispersion of pollutants will be more\ndependent on tidal movement, and the influence of the river flow will be reduced. Longer retention\ntimes in the estuary may permit bio-accumulation of toxins to a somewhat greater extent than may\nexist at present. To prevent and/or mitigate these impacts, water quality will be monitored at the\nbarrage. In addition, a low-flow weir will be constructed upstream to monitor stream flows, which will\nserve as a kind of early warning system of impending water quality problems. If it is determined that\nproblems with the water quality may be emerging, during these extreme cases, there are two\nmanagement options: (a) increased water releases from the upstream reservoirs, or (b) lower the\ninflatable top of the barrage for short periods to flush out high concentrations of pollutants.\n(ii) Fisheries. In considering the overall ecology of the river, no major changes in the\nbenthic populations are expected, except in the immediate vicinity of the barrage. Under normal low-\nflow conditions (with a continuous spill over the crest), evidence considered during IEE preparation\nand follow-up interviews with fisheries experts suggest that fish migration would not be adversely\naffected because migration generally occurs during times when the weir will be submerged. It is not\nlikely that any downstream migration of the giant freshwater prawn will be hindered and so affect the\nspawning activity of this species, as the barrier will be in operation only during the dry period of\nJanuary-March, which is outside the spawning season.\n(iii) Transportation.  The  free  movement  of  sand  barges  and  logging  rafts  will  be\nrestricted to some extent by the barrier when in operation. The design of the inflatable barrier\ninvolves a sluice gate of a width of 10 meters that can be operated to allow river crafts to go\ndownstream when the rubber dam is inflated during the dry period. Adverse impacts may therefore\nbe restricted to additional waiting time that may have to occur during low flows (coinciding with daily\nsupply pumping times), and to possible longer delays during very low flows when lowering of the\nsluice gate may be more restricted. Access to one or more of the existing sand-mining landing sites\nmay be affected, and alternative sites may need to be located.\n(iv) Others. The main solids transport in the river occurs during the wet season with high\nflows. Under these circumstances it is not expected that the downstream river transport will be\naffected. Some deposition may initially occur along the upstream barrage sill, but most solids will be", "64\nAppendix 11, page 4\ntransported with the spill flow. During low flows, an increase in elevation of about 1 meter can be\nexpected in the upstream water level of the river, resulting in slightly raised groundwater levels in the\nriparian areas. This is not expected to cause any significant negative impacts on human activities\nnear the river.\n2. Low-Flow Weirs\n11. The precise locations and designs of the low-flow weirs are not known at this time. However,\nan assessment was made of one possible location above the proposed Kelani barrage. The impacts\nare expected to be similar to, but smaller in scale and magnitude than, those described for the\nKelani barrage. The weirs will be built to measure low flows, and so will be of low profile and minimal\nimpact. Provision has been made in the Project for the recruitment of an environment specialist and\nsociologist/public participation specialist to undertake IEEs for the weirs once their location and\ndesign are known. The IEEs will be submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for review and\napproval prior to the initiation of any construction activities.\n3. Institutional Development\n12. This will involve capacity building assistance to improve the sustainable management of\nwater resources. Therefore, impacts of this component are expected to be positive.\nE. Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n13. NWSDB will be the Executing Agency for the Kelani Conservation Barrage, and the Irrigation\nDepartment will be the Implementing Agency for the low-flow weirs. A resident engineer will control\nand supervise the construction at each site, seeing to it that environmental conditions are complied\nwith.  Necessary  environmental  monitoring  activities  will  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  resident\nengineer\u2019s responsibilities. NWSDB and Irrigation Department units that are currently undertaking\nroutine water quality surveys will carry out environmental monitoring during the operation phase.\n14. An environmental specialist will be tasked with preparing clauses in the tender documents for\nthe civil engineers, reflecting the recommendations made in the IEE and subsequent assessments.\nThese will clearly specify the contractor\u2019s environmental management responsibilities, including\npreparation of an environmental management plan and health and safety plan to be approved by the\nresident  engineer.  Coordination  with  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  will  be  initiated  and\nmaintained.\n15. Major  monitoring  activities  will  cover  (i)  implementation  of  health  and  safety  measures,\n(ii) water quality, and (iii) erosion.\nF. Findings and Recommendations\n16. The most significant potential impacts will be associated with part B of the Project, and\nspecifically with construction and operation of the Kelani barrage. They include potential water\nquality impacts from excavation during river profiling and operation at the work site, and possible\npolluted conditions in the vicinity of the barrage during extreme low flows. These impacts will be\navoided or adequately mitigated by following standard best practices for construction and operation\nof the barrage.\n17. Resettlement will be mostly temporary and compensation requirements small. Approximately\n5-7 households are expected to be affected. No relocation of households is expected. Procedures\nfor compensation have been identified and described.", " 65\nAppendix 11, page 5\n18. Major impacts on the overall ecology of the river are not expected. The barrage is not\nexpected to impede the migration of fish because it will be submerged during migratory events.\n19. The movement of river traffic will be accommodated through the design of the inflatable\nbarrier,  which  has  a  sluice  gate  that  can  be  operated  to  allow  passage  by  river  craft.  Minor\ninconveniences may be experienced during periods of extremely low flow.\n20. Impacts and mitigation measures related to the low-flow weirs are expected to be similar to\nthose identified for the Kelani barrage, but of smaller scope and magnitude. Part B, which involves\ncapacity building activities, is expected to result in positive impacts.\n21. Adequate  provisions  have  been  made  in  the  project  budget  to  cover  all  environmental\nmitigation costs and costs of compensation.\nG. Conclusions\n22. Overall, the Project is expected to be environmentally beneficial, especially as concerns the\ncapacity building component for water resources management and the low-flow weirs, which will\nprovide  for  more  rational  allocation  of  water  and  for  water  quality  monitoring.  No  major\nenvironmental, occupational, health, safety, or socioeconomic impacts are expected to occur. The\nrequired  mitigation  measures  are  well  known  and  available,  and  will  largely  depend  on\nimplementation of standard best practices.\n23. The locations and designs of the low-flow weirs are not yet known. Assessment of one\npossible site indicated that there would be no major impacts. Rather the impacts and mitigation\nmeasures will be similar in nature to, but smaller and of less magnitude than, those for the Kelani\nbarrage.  Provision  has  been  made  under  the  Project  for  environmental  assessment  of  the\nmultipurpose weirs once the locations and designs are known, and for securing approval from ADB\nbefore construction begins.\n24. With the exception of the additional IEE work to be carried out for the low-flow weirs, the IEE\nfor the Project is considered to represent the full environmental impact assessment.", "66\nAppendix 12, page 1\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\nA.  Introduction\n1.  The proposed Project is designed to assist the Government to establish and strengthen\nthe institutions needed for effective water resource management in the country, as well as to\naddress, through the provision of urgently needed infrastructure, some consequences of the\nlack of adequate water resource management in the past. The economic and financial analyses\nwere done for only one component of the Project, the Kelani Conservation Barrage, as this is\nthe  only  component  that  results  in  directly  productive  and  measurable  benefits.  Other\ncomponents  have  the  overall  objective  of  building  capacity  for  integrated  water  resource\nmanagement, and will have longer term impacts by establishing the enabling environment for\nfuture sector investments.\n2.  The  main  aims  of  the  Kelani  Conservation  Barrage  proposed  to  be  constructed  at\nAmbatale on the Kelani River are to\n(i)   improve the discharge and energy efficiency of the existing pumping facilities at the\nAmbatale intake by raising the river level, thereby significantly increasing the quantity\nof water that can be extracted during the dry season;\n(ii)   ensure that saline water due to tidal effects does not enter the water intake at\nAmbatale;\n(iii)   conserve  existing  water  resources  in  the  basin  by  eliminating  the  need  for\nunscheduled releases from an upstream reservoir, a practice currently adopted on\noccasions to drive out saline water and raise water levels to avoid pump shutdowns;\n(iv)   provide improved sediment exclusion and desilting to protect against the buildup of\nsand at the existing Ambatale intake; and\n(v)   satisfy the future demand for potable water in the Greater Colombo area in a cost-\neffective and sustainable manner, with particular regard to the poor and low-income\nhouseholds in central Colombo and northern towns in the area.\n3.  The proposed barrage aims to improve the management of water resources of the\nKelani  River.  Therefore,  the  major  benefits  are  derived  from  restoring  the  capacity  of  the\nAmbatale water supply intake to the original design and providing the opportunity to expand its\ncapacity in the future. The barrage provides a cost-effective solution to satisfy the immediate\nand urgent demand for additional potable water in the Greater Colombo area, and will contribute\nto future demand needs. Keeping this in view, the economic and financial analyses seek to\njustify the investment in terms of its potential impact on the overall present and future operations\nof the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) in augmenting the water supply.\n4.  Within the framework of these objectives, the economic analysis has focused on the\ncomparison between the with- and without-Project cases. Alternatives to augmenting the water\nsupply for the Greater Colombo area using other sources were considered. Groundwater is\nalready  exploited  to  some  extent,  but  is  considered  to  have  limited  potential  for  further\ndevelopment, particularly due to problems with its quality. The most practical alternative, and\nthe one considered in the analysis (para. 8), is extraction of raw water from the Kalu River.\nAnother  alternative  was  provision  of  further  upstream  storage.  However,  investigation  and", "67\nAppendix 12, page 2\nimplementation of this project would be a long-term undertaking. Because the lead time for this\nis too long in view of the current urgency to supply additional water, it was not been considered\nas a realistic alternative.\nB.  Project Costs and Benefits\n1.  Costs\n5.  At January 2000 prices, the costs of constructing the Kelani Conservation Barrage were\nestimated in terms of capital costs, replacement capital costs over the life of the barrage, and\nannual operating and maintenance (O&M) costs. The capital replacement costs relate to the\nperiodic replacement of inflating equipment for the rubber barrier (15 years), miscellaneous\nequipment including gates and screens (20 years), and the rubber barrier itself (30 years).\n6.  Shadow factors of 1.0 for skilled labor, 0.7 for unskilled labor, and 1.1 for electricity were\nused to convert financial values into economic values. Conversion factors were not applied to\ntradable goods. Other financial costs were converted to economic costs using a standard\nconversion factor of 0.94, computed from 10 years data of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.\nEconomic costs were computed from constant 2000 prices.\n2.  Quantified Benefits\n7.  The main benefits attributable to the construction of the Kelani Conservation Barrage\nwere evaluated in terms of cost savings\n(i)   from providing equivalent raw water volumes from an alternative source (the Kalu\nRiver) in the dry season;\n(ii)   accruing from improved efficiency of the existing pumping facilities due to higher river\nlevels at Ambatale in the dry season; and\n(iii)   from lower raw water extraction losses at Ambatale in the dry season.\n8.  In the economic analysis, the value of the additional water extraction offered by Kelani\nConservation Barrage was measured in terms of the costs saved by not having to extract\nequivalent volumes of raw water for the Greater Colombo area from the next most practical\nalternative. As noted, the only reliable alternative source of appropriate size that could be\ntapped within the time frame required is transbasin transfers from the Kalu River, the adjacent\nriver basin to the south. Three potential alternative scenarios (low, medium, and high1) were\nconsidered for future incremental raw water extraction at Ambatale. The results of modeling\nshow that in all three scenarios, the dry season demand deficits begin to rise significantly from\n2005  onward,  and  become  substantial  between  2015  and  2025  without  the  Project.  The\neconomic value of the incremental raw water extracted from the Kelani River with the Project is\nequivalent to the economic cost of conveying that water from the Kalu River to Ambatale for\ntreatment and distribution to Colombo North.  In the medium-demand scenario, the capital\ninvestment required is estimated at $18.4 million, with annual O&M costs rising from about\n$57,000 in 2010 to $76,000 in 2025.\n                                                \n1  In the three scenarios, total raw water extraction is projected to increase by 40, 57, and 75 percent, respectively,\nfrom the 1999 levels by the year 2025.  Incremental extraction per year has been projected accordingly.  The\nmedium-demand scenario is considered the most likely.", " 68\nAppendix 12, page 3\n9.  The construction of the Kelani Conservation Barrage will raise average water levels at\nthe existing Ambatale intakes by an average of one meter in the dry season from January to\nApril  each  year.  This  will  generate  savings  in  energy  costs  ($22,000  per  year  from  2005\nonward). There will also be savings in pump maintenance costs ($15,000 per year) attributable\nto reduced pumping head and less sand entering the intakes.\n10.  Raw water extraction losses were estimated to be 350,000 cubic meters (m3) per year,\nbased on NWSDB\u2019s records (1996-1997)2 of the number of times and duration when the intake\npumps tripped due to low water levels. The losses are projected to increase to 430,000 m3 in\n2001 and 560,000 m3 by 2005. Using the present average water tariff of SLRs13.40 per m3 as a\nreflection of the economic cost, the resulting loss would rise from $66,000 to $81,000 by 2001\nand $106,000 by 2005.\n3.  Nonquantified Benefits\n11.  The economic evaluation is further supported by an assessment of a number of non-\nquantified factors, which have a positive impact on the investment decision. These are\n(i)   social benefits in terms of more cost-effective supplies of potable water to the\ncommunities north of the Kelani River within the Greater Colombo area;\n(ii)   protection of Colombo\u2019s major source of potable water from the possibility of\nfuture  saline  intrusion  in  the  dry  season,  which  could  potentially  disrupt  the\ncapital\u2019s water supplies;\n(iii)   improved water resource management for the Kelani River in terms of more\neffective  water  allocation  between  potable  water  supplies  for  Colombo  and\nhydropower  utilization  in  the  upper  catchment,  by  eliminating  the  need  for\nunscheduled  releases  from  a  hydropower  reservoir  to  push  back  the  saline\nwedge; and\n(iv)   avoidance of the economic disruption and environmental problems that would be\ncaused in the without-Project case by the construction of the raw water main\npipeline from the alternative source, the Kalu River. The potential disruption of\nroad traffic on the suburban roads between the Kalu the Kelani rivers would have\na direct adverse impact on the social, economic, and commercial life of important\nareas of Colombo.\nC.  Economic Analysis\n12.  The results of the economic analysis are presented in terms of (i) average incremental\neconomic cost (AIEC), and (ii) economic internal rate of return (EIRR). The AIEC is a useful\nmeasure in determining the marginal economic cost of the incremental raw water provided by\nthe Kelani Conservation Barrage.  It is also a useful indicator of the additional tariff implications.\nThe AIEC was calculated as a function of the incremental raw water in the dry season.  At a\ndiscount rate of 12 percent and a medium-demand scenario, the AIEC is SLRs10.50 per m3,\nwhich compares favorably with NWSDB\u2019s present average unit costs in 1998 of SLRs14.60 per\nm3 every unit billed.  Even in the worst case low-demand scenario, the AIEC at SLRs12.50 is\nless than the unit costs for every unit billed.\n                                                \n2  No such records were available for 1998-1999. The estimate has been adjusted downward, as many of the\nrecorded observations in 1996 were outside the normal dry season.", " 69\nAppendix 12, page 4\n13.  The results of the EIRR calculations for the base case in each scenario, as well as of the\nsensitivity tests are summarized in Table A12.1.  The base case EIRRs range from 16.0 percent\nto 22.1 percent. The sensitivity tests indicate that the EIRRs are robust, with all rates of return\nremaining above 10 percent, except in one test with the low-demand scenario.\nTable A12.1:  EIRR by Scenario\n(percent)\nItem Low Demand Medium Demand High Demand\nBase Case 16.0 22.1 22.1\nCosts +10% 13.5 19.3 19.3\nBenefits \u201310% 13.3 19.0 19.1\nCosts +10% and 11.1 16.3 16.4\nBenefits \u201310%\nBenefits lagged 2 yr 10.9 14.5 14.5\nCosts +10% and 9.4 12.8 12.9\nBenefits lagged 2 yr\nD.  Financial Analysis\n14.  The cost estimates were made in April 2000 prices. Inflation rates were assumed at 8\npercent for local costs and 2.4 percent for foreign costs, and constant purchasing power parity\nmethod was used. The capital costs for the Kelani Conservation Barrage were estimated to be\n$11.4 million, including physical and price contingencies, over the five-year project period.\nAssuming that the Government will onlend to NWSDB 50 percent of the total cost, and that the\nonlending will be for 24 years with 2 years grace, the interest during construction is estimated to\nbe $1.2 million. The debt repayment profile shows annual repayments rising from $0.6 million in\n2005 to $0.8 million in 2006, before declining slowly during the remaining repayment period.\n1.  NWSDB\u2019s Financial Performance\n15.  A review of NWSDB\u2019s audited financial statements for 1992-1998 indicates that its\noverall financial performance has been more or less consistent with a no profit/no loss position\nto provide an affordable water supply service to customers. Net operating income has ranged\nfrom SLRs80 million to SLRs180 million per year, which implies a decline in real terms, taking\ninto account an average annual inflation of 8 percent. The only year in which a deficit was\nrecorded was in 1996. During the period under review, the annual operating ratio has ranged\nfrom 95 percent to 130 percent, which is above the international norms for the urban water\nsupply sector. The average tariff per unit of water has, however, remained almost static at\nbetween SLRs10 and SLRs13 per m3.\n16.  The main factors contributing to NWSDB\u2019s performance are the following:\n(i)  Both operating revenue and operating expenses nearly tripled over the six-year\nperiod 1992-1998.\n(ii)  Annual depreciation charges more than doubled from SLRs199 million in 1992 to\nSLRs474 million in 1998. A significant part of this increase occurred during the\nlast three years largely due to a revaluation of assets and an increased capital\nexpenditure program.", " 70\nAppendix 12, page 5\n(iii)  Interest charges also tripled, from SLRs101 million in 1992 to SLRs300 million in\n1998. In this context, NWSDB is favored by the fact that about 50 percent of its\ncapital investment program is grant-financed by the Government, even though\nthe other half has been financed at hard onlending terms with an interest rate of\n10 percent.\n17.  NWSDB has a high level of accounts receivable, about 50 percent (equivalent to six\nmonths) of annual revenue, whereas three months revenue is an acceptable target.  It is evident\nthat NWSDB needs to address this situation. The latest projections prepared by the Finance\nDepartment expect average water tariffs to rise by nearly 70 percent in current prices, from\nSLRs13.6 per m3 in 1999 to SLRs17.9 per m3 in 2002 and SLRs22.6 per m3 in 2005. A policy to\nguide future tariff revisions was approved in June 2000. It includes tariff increases of about 25\npercent to become effective on 1 December 2000. Further revision of tariffs will be guided by\nthe covenants under the ongoing Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.3\n18.  Finally, one of NWSDB\u2019s major operational issues is the high level of nonrevenue water\nand unaccounted-for water. According to NWSDB data, countrywide nonrevenue water has\nconsistently been 40-45 percent of recorded annual raw water production, and 55 percent in the\nGreater Colombo area, with an unaccounted-for water factor of about 35 percent. NWSDB is\naddressing this issue with the support of Japanese and Norwegian aid, particularly in the\nGreater Colombo area. With the success of this ongoing campaign, the level of nonrevenue\nwater is expected to decline significantly by 2005.\n2.  Financial Impact of Kelani Conservation Barrage\n19.  As the Kelani Conservation Barrage will not be a profit center in its own right4, an\nassessment was made of the key cost parameters that will have a direct impact on NWSDB\u2019s\nfuture financial projections and commitments.  The main factors are annual costs for (i) O&M,\n(ii) depreciation  charges,  (iii)  interest  charges,  and  (iv) repayment  of  principal  and  the\noutstanding debt.\n20.  The financial impact of the barrage on NWSDB\u2019s performance was measured in terms of\nthe percentage increases in annual O&M, and depreciation and interest charges over the\nprojected values without the barrage. The figures for the year 2005 are summarized in Table\nA12.2.\n                                                \n3  Loan SRI 1575: Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, for $75,000,000, approved on 6 November\n1997.\n4  Since the barrage is not a revenue-generating project in itself, its financial internal rate of return was not\nestimated.  Economic justification was found to be sufficient. The average incremental financial cost of raw water\nwas, however, estimated at SLRs12.2 per m3 in the medium-demand scenario, compared with the current tariff\nof SLRs13.6 per m3.", " 71\nAppendix 12, page 6\nTable A12.2: Impact of Kelani Conservation Barrage\non Selected NWSDB Financial Parameters\nin 2005\nCost Component Percent Increase\nOperation and maintenance 0.1\nDepreciation 2.1\nInterest Charges 4.7\nTotal Costs 1.1\nNWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board.\n21.  Estimates of the annual O&M costs of the Kelani Conservation Barrage were based on\nan assumption of 0.25 percent per annum on the capital costs of civil works and 2.5 percent on\nthe costs of electrical and mechanical equipment. Depreciation charges for the barrage were\ncalculated on a straight-line basis without annual revaluation, and are estimated to be $383,000\nbased on an average weighted depreciation factor of 2.6 percent per year (equivalent to an\naverage asset life of 38 years). Interest charges have been estimated based on the terms\nindicated in para. 14 above.\n22.  In view of the financial parameters highlighted in Table A12.2, it is anticipated that the\nKelani Conservation Barrage will have a marginal impact on future average water tariffs. For\nexample, NWSDB\u2019s projected average water tariff of SLRs22.60 per m3 for 2005 will need to be\nincreased by only SLRs0.30 per m3 to incorporate the cost impact of the barrage."], "metadata": {"Author": "ldm", "CreationDate": "D:20000829141143Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "ModDate": "D:20131112190333+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R173-00RRP.doc"}}
