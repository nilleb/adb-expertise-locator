INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the Philippines requested through its Department of Finance that the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) provide capacity development technical assistance (TA) to \naddress skills shortages in high-growth industries by aligning higher education curricula with \ninternational standards and labor market demand, while building on public and private initiatives. \nThe TA will use knowledge hubs to develop replicable models for (i) strengthening links among \nthe government, industry, and higher education institutions (HEIs) in the information technology \nand  business  process  outsourcing  (IT\u2013BPO)  industry;  (ii)  sharing  and  learning  regional \nknowledge and experiences; and (iii) supporting other high-growth industries.1 During the fact-\nfinding mission  on  26 April\u20134  May  2012, the government  and  ADB agreed  on  TA scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Faced with the challenge of moving the economy into new areas with higher growth and \njob creation, the government is strengthening its education system to meet the labor demands \nof innovative and growing industries. The Philippines needs to improve its competitiveness by \nprioritizing sectors in which the country has competitive advantages and ensuring a reliable \nlabor supply chain. Studies indicate that Philippine membership in the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations; a large, young, and well-educated workforce; and improved access to fast-\ngrowing  markets  situate  the  country  well  to  attract  large  investments  that  can  generate \nsignificant numbers of new high-quality jobs in key sectors such as IT\u2013BPO.3  \n \n3.  IT\u2013BPO is the Philippine sector with the fastest-growing employment, and it ranks high for \ngenerating revenue.4 From 2004 to 2009, employment in IT\u2013BPO grew by 34.5% annually and \nrevenues by 37.9%. Revenues generated by the industry reached $8.9 billion in 2010.5 IT\u2013BPO \nemployed 638,000 workers at the end of 2011, two-thirds in the voice segment. In 2010, the \ncountry surpassed India in terms of voice-related outsourced work to become the global leader in \nthis  segment.  The  industry  is  now  expanding  its  higher-value  and  more  complex  services, \nincluding  software  development,  financial  services,  accounting,  and  medical  services.  The \nindustry is expected to generate revenues of $20 billion\u2013$25 billion and 1.3 million jobs by 2016. \nThe worldwide trend toward IT\u2013BPO is projected to be sustained, and the Philippines has the \nfollowing advantages: (i) a huge educated workforce with strong customer-service orientation, (ii) \n                                                \n1  A knowledge hub is an institution, entity, or group that operates in a knowledge domain or activity and whose \nexcellence is recognized by those who engage with or are supported by it. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 June 2012.  \n3  Other sectors are agribusiness, creative industries, infrastructure, manufacturing, and mining. After electronics and \nremittances from overseas workers, IT\u2013BPO and tourism fill out the top four sources of foreign exchange. See Joint \nForeign Chambers of Commerce in the Philippines. 2010. Arangkada Philippines 2010: A Business Perspective. \nhttp://www.investphilippines.info/arangkada/home.php; See also C. Habito. 2010. An Agenda for High and Inclusive \nGrowth in the Philippines. Manila: Asian Development Bank. \n4  IT\u2013BPO refers to the whole outsourcing industry in the Philippines. It includes IT and engineering services \noutsourcing. IT outsourcing consists of software development, applications development and management, IT \ninfrastructure management, and technical support. Engineering services outsourcing focuses on engineering design \nfor  manufacturing,  industry,  or  construction;  architectural  design;  construction  management;  and  building \nmanagement. BPO refers to customer service (voice and non-voice), finance and accounting, human resources, \naccounting,  transcription,  legal  processes,  health  care  information  management,  other  knowledge  process \noutsourcing,  and  other  services  not  under  IT  or  engineering  services  outsourcing.  Animation  and  game \ndevelopment overlap these classifications and include elements of creative process outsourcing. See the first \nreference in footnote 3. \n5  Government of the Philippines, Commission on Information and Communications Technology. 2010. The Philippine \nDigital Strategy\u2014Transformation 2.0: Digitally Empowered Nation. Manila. \n ", "2   \nnearly half a million university and college graduates every year, (iii) highly reliable and low-cost \ntelecommunications infrastructure, (iv) diverse and inexpensive site locations, (v) strong national \ngovernment support, and (vi) highly competitive operating costs. However, the IT\u2013BPO market is \nvery dynamic, even volatile. In addition, education and training systems in the Philippines are \ninadequately robust to support high economic growth, requiring substantial reform, innovative \nsolutions, and additional resources.6 In the IT\u2013BPO industry, the supply of talent to support \neconomic growth drivers continues to be a quantitative and qualitative challenge. The growing IT\u2013\nBPO industry requires a much-improved education system.  \n \n4.  Despite a steady influx of tertiary graduates, demand for high-quality labor in the IT\u2013\nBPO sector has outpaced supply.7 The country\u2019s educational institutions are not providing a \nsufficient number of suitable graduates to meet labor demand from the rapidly growing IT\u2013BPO \nindustry. Stiff competition among outsourcing suppliers and clients for a limited supply of talent \nhas brought high attrition rates and, consequently, increased spending on recruitment and \ntraining. IT\u2013BPO companies provide education and training to their prospective employees, \nwhich increases overhead costs. In addition, there are not enough midlevel managers or senior \nexecutives in the industry to lead the large pools of young employees. Another challenge facing \nthe IT\u2013BPO sector is weak university\u2013industry linkage. HEI programs are not directly related or \ncomplementary to outsourcing. Many college graduates lack proficiency in the English, math, \nscience, and technology skills that the industry needs. Low IT literacy and poor access to \ncomputers for the larger segment of the population also hinder the development of suitable \ntalent for IT\u2013BPO.  \n \n5.  The  Business  Processing  Association  of  the  Philippines  (BPAP)  and  government \nagencies responsible for education are undertaking initiatives to address the talent supply gap \nin  the  IT\u2013BPO  sector.8 BPAP  has  13  talent-management  programs  at  various  stages  of \ndeployment in collaboration with the government, including the Service Management Program \n(SMP),  which  was  approved  by  the  Commission  on  Higher  Education  (CHED)  for \nimplementation in school year 2012/13. The SMP is a 21-unit minor degree course that can be \ntaken by university or high school students intending to go into IT\u2013BPO and was designed by \nindustry practitioners to provide students with the required skills set. After completing the SMP, \nstudents can proceed with specialized education in service management to augment their major \nfields such as business, IT, engineering, or other topics. The SMP is being piloted in selected \nHEIs beginning in school year 2012/13.  \n \n                                                \n6  A recent study identifies the following challenges to higher education in the Philippines: (i) inefficient and ineffective \npublic spending on higher education; (ii) the proliferation of low-quality HEIs, many of which are state and local \nuniversities and colleges; (iii) inequitably distributed higher education subsidies; and (iv) the lack of efficient \nmechanisms to allow financially constrained families to benefit from high returns from tertiary education. Addressing \nthese challenges will require policy reforms to (i) rationalize the structure of public higher education service delivery; \n(ii) improve the functioning of higher education markets and public good benefits; (iii) improve higher education \nfinance, resource mobilization, and cost effectiveness; (iv) improve equity of access to quality HEIs; and (v) raise \nthe quality of HEIs. See Philippine Institute for Development Studies. 2012. Economic Policy Monitor: Education for \nDevelopment. Makati.  \n7  Colleges and universities in the Philippines are generically called higher education institutions, or HEIs, by the \nCommission on Higher Education, which controls and supervises them, HEIs are generally classified as public or \nprivate. Colleges are tertiary institutions that typically offer one or few specialized courses such as in the sciences \nor liberal arts, or specific professional courses. Universities must operate at least eight degree programs. As of 4 \nAugust  2011,  there  are  2,247  HEIs  in  the  country,  of  which  643  were  public  and  1,604  were  private. \nhttp://www.ched.gov.ph/chedwww/index.php/eng/Information \n8  Founded in 2004, BPAP has more than 300 member firms and plays a pivotal role in sustaining the rapid growth of \nthe IT\u2013BPO industry by working to ensure an enduring supply of high-quality labor, supporting service innovation, \nproviding country visibility, and helping investors set up operations in the Philippines. \n ", "  3 \n6.  BPAP continues to promote and implement its Global Competitiveness Assessment Tool \n(GCAT), which is an industry-developed online test to assess basic competencies identified as \nrequired by employers of entry-level employees. CHED and the information and communication \ntechnology (ICT) office of the Department of Science and Technology are discussing with BPAP \nexpanding GCAT coverage across the country. The fourth major BPAP talent development \nprogram  is  Advanced  English  Pre-employment  Training  (AdEPT),  which  adapted  IT\u2013BPO \nbridging training for deployment in HEIs. BPAP and its partner associations are developing \nmore  faculty-development  programs,  including  teacher  training  and  trainers  training.  BPAP \nlaunched its first program with an HEI in Quezon Province to implement AdEPT and GCAT. \n \n7.  Among BPAP\u2019s other programs under development are its emerging services program \nand its associate program. The emerging services program aims to address the educational and \ntraining  needs  of  specialized  services  such  as  finance  and  accounting,  health  care,  IT, \nengineering services, and creative services. The associate program aims to help high school \ngraduates become employable with 6\u201312 months of training. A service technology management \nprogram  is  being  developed  that  can  be  offered  by  universities  for  either  a  postgraduate \ncertificate or a master\u2019s degree for professionals with experience in other industries who want to \ntake up IT\u2013BPO as a career shift, also equipping potential executives and managers with \nindustry-relevant information, education, and experiences.  \n \n8.  The TA is consistent with the Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016, which identifies \nIT\u2013BPO as among the top-10 priority development sectors with the highest potential in terms of \neconomic growth and job creation. As the local IT\u2013BPO industry is projected to expand its \nmarket  share  in  global  BPO  operations,  the  country\u2019s  education  systems  need  to  be \nstrengthened to ensure that appropriate skills are sustainably developed. The government\u2019s \ncommitment to restructuring pre-university education is a significant enabler that provides a \nunique opportunity  to  substantially  reform  higher  education systems  and  programs.  In this \ncontext, the introduction of innovative and creative higher education programs relevant to the \ncountry\u2019s competitive advantages in sectors such as IT\u2013BPO is timely and complementary. The \nTA fully aligns with the government\u2019s knowledge strategy and program9 and ADB\u2019s knowledge \nmanagement plan.10 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be the improved alignment of higher education with the needs of the \neconomy. The outcome will be a replicable and sustainable system of ICT-enabled knowledge \nhubs for the improved teaching and learning of IT\u2013BPO industry-designed curricula in HEIs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The outputs will be (i) increased access to knowledge resources for IT\u2013BPO industry-\ndesigned  courses,  (ii)  enhanced  higher  education  curricula  and  instruction,  and  (iii) \nstrengthened partnership between industries and academic institutions. \n  \n11.  Access  to  knowledge  resources  increased  for  industry-designed  courses  on \ninformation technology and business process outsourcing.

The TA will (i) \nidentify lessons and best practices regarding the promotion of knowledge hubs, (ii) develop \nmodel and operational systems for knowledge hubs, (iii) develop criteria for locating knowledge \nhubs and selecting beneficiaries, and (iv) enhance capacity to manage and maintain knowledge \nhubs.  \n \n12.  Higher education curriculum and instruction enhanced. The TA will identify and \nimplement measures to align the programs and teaching of participating HEIs with the needs of \nthe IT\u2013BPO industry. It will support and facilitate the (i) further development and integration of \nBPAP\u2019s  talent-development  programs  such  as  those  approved  by  CHED  on  service \nmanagement,  AdEPT,  the  GCAT,  and  service  technology  management,  as  well  as  other \nindustry-designed courses in the teaching curricula of participating HEIs; (ii) accreditation of \nindustry-designed courses by the governing bodies of participating HEIs and/or CHED, as well \nas industry associations like BPAP; (iii) development of online learning modules and study \nguides for the courses; (iv) development of online training programs for teaching the courses; \n(v) training of teachers and teacher trainers; (vi) development of assessment tools to track \nprogress and assess the learning outcomes of students and teachers; and (vii) adoption by \nparticipating HEIs of a standard industry-designed instrument such as the GCAT to test the core \ncompetencies of students. The TA will directly benefit at least 900 teachers and 3,000 tertiary-\nlevel students, of which at least 50% are females. \n \n13.  Partnerships with industries and academic institutions strengthened. The TA will \nsupport twinning arrangements between international and national HEIs to develop knowledge \nresources for the knowledge hubs and improve higher education curricula and student learning. \nStronger industry\u2013university linkage will likewise be pursued, particularly toward adopting cost-\neffective industry models to strengthen higher education programs and address skills shortages. \nParticipating HEIs will manage the knowledge hubs and provide long-term institutional support \nfor their continued operation and maintenance. The TA will support the development of a \nbusiness model that optimizes private sector participation and includes public sector support to \nsustain the propagation and operation of knowledge hubs after TA implementation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $552,500, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in terms of remuneration for counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, utilities, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Department of Finance will be the executing agency. It has demonstrated strong \nownership of the TA and expressed its commitment to lead and coordinate TA implementation. \nThe department will bring a whole-government approach to the TA and mobilize public sector \nsupport  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  initiatives.  A  steering  committee  chaired  by  the \ndepartment and composed of CHED, the National Economic and Development Authority, and \nother government  agencies  will  be  established. The steering committee  will provide quality \nassurance and ensure effective coordination among government agencies, development partners, \nand stakeholders. The TA will be implemented from 16 October 2012 to 15 October 2015 and \nrequire 5 person-months of international consulting services and 56 person-months of national \n ", "  5 \nconsulting  services.  As  the  TA  will  be  designed  to  flexibly  respond  to  the  requests  of \ngovernment and industry, about 2 person-months of international consulting inputs and 12 \nperson-months of national consulting inputs\u2014possibly in the areas of project management, \nstrategy formulation, curriculum and content development, and higher education administration \nand governance\u2014will be determined during TA implementation. Based on their experience and \ntrack record, BPAP, the University of the Philippines (UP) through the UP Open University, and \nthe  Asian  Institute  of Management  (AIM)  will  be engaged  using  single-source  selection  in \naccordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \n16.  As the umbrella association for the IT\u2013BPO industry in the Philippines, combining more \nthan 300 industry and industry-support members, BPAP plays a pivotal role in promoting the \ncompetitive advantages and growth potential of the Philippines in existing and new areas of \noutsourcing. BPAP supports the industry through offshore marketing, education and training, \nand the promotion of legislation and public policy. Since its creation in 2004, BPAP has worked \nclosely with the industry, HEIs, and the Philippine government on a number curriculum-and \ntalent-development projects.  \n \n17.  UP and AIM are leading HEIs in the country, with extensive international and in-country \nexperience  in  educational  administration,  curriculum  design,  knowledge  management,  and \ncapacity  development.  UP  is  the  premier  university  in  the  country  and  pioneer  in  higher \neducation, including the UP Open University\u2019s distance and e-learning programs. It has 14 \ncampuses in the country with more than 50,000 students enrolled in 240 undergraduate and \n402 graduate programs. The UP Open University is the only distance education institution in \nSoutheast Asia that offers most of its courses online. It has a network of 10 learning centers, a \nvirtual learning center, and 19 testing centers in the country and abroad.  UP has robust \ninstitutional linkages with industry players, and one of its campuses is home to several IT\u2013BPO \ncompanies. It has partnered before with ADB in knowledge management initiatives.   \n \n18.  AIM is one of Asia\u2019s leading business and management schools, with an alumni network \nin more than 40 countries, strong professional ties with business, and experience in operating \nand managing knowledge hubs. It hosts the ADB-assisted knowledge hub for poverty reduction \nand the World Bank-supported Global Distance Learning Center. AIM has conducted business \nanalyses  for  key  industries.  Its  key  publications  include  national  and  city  competitiveness \nreports. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  BPAP will be responsible for managing the TA while ensuring closer university\u2013industry \nlinkage and the sustainability of TA benefits. UP will be responsible for designing and deploying \ne-learning  products  for  industry-designed  courses  in  HEIs.  AIM  will  lead  TA  knowledge-\nmanagement  components.  All  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All procured assets will be transferred to HEIs \nafter TA completion. Disbursements under the TA will accord with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof  the  Philippines  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and \nKnowledge  Partnership  Fund  for  Strengthening  Knowledge-Based  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImproved alignment  Philippine education  Institute for Management  Global economic \nof higher education  system scoring at least  Development World  stability \nprograms with the  4.50 on the Institute for  Competitiveness Online   \nneeds of the  Management  Database  Risk \neconomy  Development World     \nCompetitiveness Online    Economic shocks  \nDatabase by 2018, up   \nfrom 4.03 in 2009 \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n        \nA replicable and  IT\u2013BPO industry-designed  Annual reports of the  Government support \nsustainable system  courses adopted in at least  Commission on Higher   \nof  ICT-enabled  3 HEIs by Q3 2015  Education  Cooperation of HEIs \nknowledge hubs       \ndeveloped for the  Adoption of GCAT in  Annual reports of the  Risk \nimproved teaching  selected HEIs by Q3 2015  Business Process   \nand learning of  IT\u2013     Association of the  Teacher attrition \nBPO industry- Philippines \ndesigned curricula \nin HEIs \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n       \n1.
