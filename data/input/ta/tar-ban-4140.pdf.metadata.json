INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) Supporting Good Governance Initiatives was approved in \nJuly 2003.1 The TA comprised two parts. Part A was designed to support governance initiatives \nin the secured financing market in the private sector and part B was designed to support public \nsector anticorruption initiatives. \n \n2.  Following a TA agreement executed between the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof Bangladesh and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 6 November 2003, implementation \nof part A of the TA commenced in January 2004 through four individual consultants. Part A of \nthe TA is being executed by the Finance Division, Ministry of Finance. Implementation of part B \ncommenced in January 2004 through the consulting services of International Business and \nTechnical  Consultants,  Inc.  (IBTCI)  of  the  United  States  of  America,  in  association  with \nUniconsult International Limited of Bangladesh. Part B of the TA is being executed by the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office (PMO). \n \n3.  As approved, the TA was scheduled to commence in October 2003 and to be completed \nin May 2004. However, actual commencement was delayed until January 2004.2 The delayed \nstart of consulting services was due in part to the TA agreement process and in part to the time \ntaken to identify and field appropriate consultants to undertake the challenging governance \nassignments under the TA. The progress of part A has been affected by the need to address \nadditional challenges arising from stakeholder dialogue. These include the need to promote \nconsensus  for  secured  transactions  reform  by  having  the  TA  identify  regionally  relevant \ndevelopments on secured transactions reform in the Asia and Pacific region. Progress under \npart  B  has  been  affected  by  the  need  to  develop  an  Anticorruption  Commission  (ACC) \nImplementation Plan following the enactment of an ACC Act in February 2004 and to prioritize \nand operationalize the ACC Implementation Plan in consultation with the newly appointed ACC \ncommissioners, rather than with the Government, to appropriately recognize the independence \nof the new ACC. Furthermore, to assist the ACC to succeed and avoid unrealistic expectations \nbeing placed on it, it has been important to progress governance reviews as the basis for \ngovernance  audits  and  a  public  expenditure  tracking  survey  (PETS)  methodology  in  line \nministries to prevent corruption. In that regard, there has been a demand to extend governance \nreviews in line ministries where there are significant proposed development interventions. In \naddition, there has been a demand from the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs \n(MOLJP) since March 2004 for a part C to the TA related to identification of operational and \ninfrastructure support needs in implementing the separation of the executive from the judiciary \nfunction; and the establishment of an independent, professional public prosecution service as \nwell as legal education development. Such proposed changes in the TA have received full \nsupport and formal confirmation from the Government. Related to such changes, there is a need \nfor an additional $100,000 in TA grant financing for TA 4140-BAN.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Supporting Good Governance \nInitiatives. Manila (TA No. 4140-BAN, for $950,000, approved on 4 July 2003). An additional $50,000 in TA grant \nfinancing from ADB\u2019s TA funding program was allocated in December 2003. \n2  The TA was extended until February 2005. ", "2  \nII.  BACKGROUND \n \n4.  The TA was designed to assist transparency in the secured financing sector of private \ncredit markets through a combination of legal, registry, and institutional governance reforms \nunder part A related to promoting governance in the private sector, complemented by public \nsector anticorruption initiatives under part B. \n \n5.  The three components of Part A were legal reform, registry reforms, and institutional \ngovernance reforms in the secured financing sector. The TA terms of reference supported \n \n(i)  legal reform through (a) consensus building for a modern legal framework for \nsecured transactions, (b) finalization of a new draft secured transactions law for Bangladesh, \nand (c) harmonization of a modern secured transactions regime with other laws in Bangladesh; \n \n(ii)  registry  reform  through  (a)  development  of  an  overall  architecture  for  a \ntransparent,  electronic  registration  system  based  on  the  foundation  of  a  modern  secured \ntransactions law, and (b) evaluation of a reformed secured transactions registry through a study \ntour; and \n \n(iii)  institutional governance through development of tailored governance indicators \non rules, processes, and practices in core governance competencies (including integrity and \naccountability) for self-regulatory certification of secured financing institutions. \n \n6.  The five components of Part B were support for the establishment of ACC, formulation \nof  a  national  anticorruption  strategy,  institutional  coordination  of  anticorruption  efforts, \nprevention of corruption in line ministries, and training and capacity building on anticorruption. \nThe TA terms of reference supported \n \n(i)  ACC establishment through (a) consensus building on the nature, objectives, \nmandate,  and  structure  of  the  ACC;  and  (b)  associated  drafting  of  an  ACC  law,  rules, \nregulations, and procedures and their dissemination; \n \n(ii)  a  national  strategy  on  anticorruption  through  the  development  of  a  national \nintegrity strategy; \n \n(iii)  institutional  coordination  on  anticorruption  through  a  National  Committee  on \nCorruption Prevention (NCCP) which would, among other things, facilitate a collective cross-\nverification by investigative and regulatory agencies and obtain feedback from civil society and \nstakeholders on the output of the NCCP; \n \n(iv)  prevention of institutional corruption in line ministries through public expenditure \ntracking surveys and governance audits; and \n \n(v)  training and capacity building on anticorruption among other things through (a) \nan initial train-the-trainers training on corruption prevention, (b) evaluation of a modern ACC as \npart of a study visit, and (c) estimation of resources required to build the capacity to prevent \ncorruption. \n \n7.  As originally approved, the total cost of the TA was estimated at $1,187,500 equivalent, \ncomprising $832,000 in foreign exchange cost and $355,500 equivalent in local currency. The ", "  3\nTA\u2019s $950,0003 financed the entire foreign exchange cost and $118,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency  cost.  It  provided  for  29  person-months  of  international  and  31  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services. \n \nIII.  PROPOSED CHANGE IN TA SCOPE AND AMOUNT \n \nA.   Scope \n \n8.  Part A. The scope of part A of the TA has been affected by the course of stakeholder \ndialogue. The TA has undertaken careful and extended stakeholder dialogue to explain the \nnature and purpose of this law reform for improved use of movable property as collateral for \ncredit and to promote a broad\u2013based reform consensus for it. There is a need to further buttress \nsecured transactions reform consensus, given concerns by policymakers on the applicability of \nthis reform to the operating environment in Bangladesh. \n \n9.  To support further secured transaction reform consensus\u2013building steps, two changes to \npart A are proposed. First, it is proposed that Viet Nam, a developing member country in the \nAsia and Pacific region, be selected for the study of a modern registry system4 since Viet Nam\u2019s \noperating environment is more relevant to that of Bangladesh than is that of a developed \ncountry. Second, it is proposed that the implementation arrangements for the TA be broadened \nso as not to overburden the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance in relation to the \ndemands of the ongoing stakeholder dialogue. While the Finance Division will continue to be the \nExecuting  Agency  for  the  TA,  and  to  provide  a  project  director,  working  group  members \nconsisting of experienced stakeholders from financial institutions and Bangladesh Bank will \nprovide a secretariat to the TA, with a nominee on the working group acting as member \nsecretary.  \n \n10.  Part B. The scope of Part B has been affected by the demands on the TA resulting from \nthe pace of establishment of the ACC and the expanded demand on related activity regarding \ngovernance reviews in line ministries.  \n \n11.  To address new demands for ACC and governance review work, three changes under \npart B are proposed.  First, it is proposed that certain priority actions under a draft ACC \nImplementation Plan be operationalized as of January 2005. The ACC Act was enacted in \nFebruary 2004 and was thereafter gazetted. This early accomplishment of legislative milestones \nresulted in PMO requesting TA support for the development of an ACC Implementation Plan \nunder which the operational transition of the ACC could be optimally managed. The draft ACC \nImplementation  Plan5  was  duly  prepared  and  discussed  with  PMO  and  the  TA  steering \ncommittee representatives of the Government, and received their in\u2013principle support. The draft \nACC Implementation Plan was also duly discussed with aid agencies at the Local Consultative \nGroup for Governance in Dhaka and received their endorsement and support. In November \n2004,  three  ACC  commissioners  were  duly  appointed.    With  the  appointment  of  the  \n                                                 \n3  These cost estimates were predicated on the original $950,000 TA financing approved in 2003, of which ADB is \nfinancing $700,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program and is administering $250,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from the Governance Cooperation Fund. Subsequently, an additional $50,000 was \nfinanced from ADB\u2019s TA funding program so that current TA funding is $1,000,000. \n4  Viet Nam was selected since it had already adopted a modern secured transactions law using an ADB TA and is in \nthe process of considering a change from a paper\u2013based to an electronic registry. \n5  The draft Anticorruption Commission (ACC) Implementation Plan was developed with a phase 1 for priority actions \nand phase 2 for subsequent steps. Phase 1 focuses on key areas of operational credibility for the new ACC such \nas the processes and criteria for selecting of ACC staff. \n ", "4  \ncommissioners,  the  existing  Bureau  of  Anticorruption  stands  dissolved  and  the  ACC \nestablishment process is concluded, with a corresponding need to support the initial steps in the \noperational transition of the ACC. However, the selection of ACC commissioners has also \nmeant a need to adequately preserve, protect, and defend the independence of the ACC. \nConsequently, ADB and the Government agreed that any final endorsement of the draft ACC \nImplementation Plan would need to come from the ACC commissioners, and PMO would cease \nto be the Executing Agency (EA) for the ACC portion of part B of the TA. ADB is currently in \ndialogue with the ACC commissioners to obtain endorsement of the ACC Implementation Plan.  \n \n12.  Second, governance reviews in part B that the TA have been proceeding to provide a \nbasis for governance auditing in the selected sectors by the TA during inception, namely the \ntransport sector (roads and highways) and the education sector (secondary education). 6 The \npurpose of governance reviews is to assess governance risks in all aspects of an organization \nrelated to management accountability, transparency process, and system vulnerabilities (such \nas rules, delegated authority, and qualifications of staff) and identify risk indicators (red flags) for \nmaterial leakage or capture to allow better monitoring of high\u2013risk areas for the purpose of \npreventing fraud and corruption. The governance reviews are being carried out at ministry and \nproject levels. The reviews are also accompanied by an associated devising of a methodology \n(outline  PETS)  for  surveying  beneficiaries  through  various  techniques  like  rapid  data \nassessment  and  pilot  questionnaires  so  as  to  add  a  bottom\u2013up  element  to  governance \nreviewing. Governance review and an outline PETS methodology establish a foundation for \nundertaking  governance  audits7  for  ministries and  projects.  Following  consultation  with  the \nGovernment, it is proposed that the scope of governance reviews and outline PETS under part \nB be extended to cover Bangladesh Railways, given that there is a proposed Bangladesh \nRailways Sector Development Project intervention in 2005. \n \n13.  Part C. Finally, discussions with MOJLP confirmed the need and urgency for a part C to \nthe  TA.  The  three  key  objectives  of  the  proposed  part  C  would  be  to  undertake  (i)  an \nassessment  of  particular  operational  needs  related  to  the  newly  formed  Judicial  Service \nCommission (JSC), (ii) an assessment of the institutional and infrastructural needs of the public \nprosecution system, and (iii) an assessment of the current curricular offerings and needed \nchanges thereto at the leading legal education centers in Bangladesh. \n \n14.  In terms of the separation of the executive from the judiciary function, the Government \nhas currently filed a request for further extension of time for such separation.8 The Government \nhas shown its commitment in this area by proclaiming a rule on the establishment of JSC, with \nrules  on  appointment  and  service  structure,  postings  and  transfers,  and  promotions  and \ndiscipline to be proclaimed in due course. JSC members have been chosen, but its operational \nneeds must be identified if an implementation plan for JSC is to be developed. Part C of the TA \nwould therefore focus on examining the operational needs of JSC to enable it to function \neffectively. \n \n                                                 \n6  Sectors were selected taking account of ADB sectoral interventions. In addition, cognizance was taken of full public \nexpenditure tracking surveys (PETS) work being undertaken by other aid agencies like the Department for \nInternational Development (DFID) in the education sector under the Financial Management Reform Program \n(FMRP). \n7   Governance reviews will form the basis for governance audits which will be pursued through follow\u2013on sectoral and \ncore governance interventions in partnership with each other. \n8  This represents the twentieth extension sought by the Government since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the \nMasdar Hossain case mandated a separation of the executive from the judiciary function in December 1999. ", "  5\n15.  The TA would further examine the existing public prosecution system with a view to \nidentify requirements for enhancing the system\u2019s capacity to deliver its services with greater \nefficiency, transparency, accountability, and fairness.\n \n16.  In addition, the TA will examine the curricular and teaching practices at the major legal \neducation centers in Bangladesh with a view to identify areas of legal study that need to be \neither freshly introduced or strengthened to make such educational standards competitive with \nregional and global trends.\n \nB.   Implementation and Duration\n \n17.  Part B Implementation Arrangements.  The ACC portion of part B will be undertaken \ndirectly with the ACC itself, with the Cabinet Secretariat of the Government acting as its liaison \npoint. Part B consultants working on the ACC will be entitled to share the existing project office \naccommodation. PMO will continue to act as EA for all other parts of part B. \n \n18.  Part  C  Implementation  Arrangements.  The  MOLJP  will  act  as  EA  for  part  C  for \nadministrative purposes. MOJLP will assign a senior officer as the focal point for the conduct of \npart  C  of  the  TA.  Part  C  consultants  will  be  entitled  to  share  the  existing  Project  office \naccommodation, but will make their own arrangements for all other administrative support. \n \n19.  TA Time Period. The extended tasks for parts A and B and the addition of part C \nrequire the time period of the TA to be extended to 30 June 2005. \n \nC.  Outputs and Phasing of Outputs of the TA \n \n20.  Part A of the TA has already produced an inception report, an interim report, and a draft \nsecond interim report. By April 2005, part A will produce a final report on a draft secured \ntransactions law and registry architecture, including analytical input from the registry study tour \nin Viet Nam, and governance survey indicators.  \n \n21.  Part B has already produced an inception report, an interim report, and a draft second \ninterim report.  By April 2005, part B will require a final report, which has undertaken priority \nwork under phase 1 of the ACC Implementation Plan and completed governance review work. \n \n22.  Part  C  will  require  a  TA  report  by  April  2005  on  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the \noperational needs and challenges of the JSC system, the transitional needs for establishing an \nimproved public prosecution and legal education center needs.         \n \nD.  Inputs for the TA \n \n23.  To undertake the additional work for part B on the ACC Implementation Plan and further \ngovernance reviews and outline PETS methodology work, an additional 1.5 person\u2013months of \nan international ACC legal expert will be required from supplementary TA financing.  \n \n24.  To support the work for the new part C of the TA, an additional 1.5 person-months of \ninternational judicial independence and legal education experts and an additional 2 person-\nmonths of domestic consultant time for judicial independence and public prosecution experts will \nbe required from supplementary TA financing. \n \n ", "6  \n25.  The  additional  consulting  services  for  parts  B  and  C,  which  is  to  be  financed  by \nsupplementary TA financing of $100,000 from ADB\u2019s TA Special Funds resources, are shown in \nthe Appendix under supplementary financing cost estimates. All such consulting services for \npart  B  will  be  provided  through  the  existing  consulting  firm  of  IBTCI.9  All  such  consulting \nservices for part C will be provided by individual consultants recruited through direct selection in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and PAI 2.06, para. 8. Direct \nselection will be used, given the highly specialized nature of the assignment on which such \nconsultants have performed satisfactorily in the past and/or due to their premier qualifications. \nDetailed terms of reference that will be used for all such recruitment can be obtained on \nrequest. \n \nE.  TA Project Reviews \n \n26.  A further TA review is scheduled for mid February 2005. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n27.  The President recommends that the Board approve on a no\u2013objection basis (i) the \nextension of TA implementation until 30 June 2005; (ii) increasing the total TA budget by \n$100,000; and (iii) allocating such funds as shown in the Appendix and utilizing them for the \nproposed change in scope. \n \n                                                 \n9  This will be undertaken by contract variation.
