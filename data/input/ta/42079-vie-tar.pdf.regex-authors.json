The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting Viet Nam in three strategic priority \nareas: business-led, pro-poor economic growth; social equity; and environment.1 Under the first \npriority, ADB assists the Government of Viet Nam to increase the country\u2019s productivity and \ncompetitiveness by helping to improve the business-enabling environment, develop financial \nand related market institutions, and respond to the rising demand for highly qualified human \nresources. The Government requested ADB and the World Bank to support the development of \nscience and technology universities as centers of excellence in human resource development \nand  research.  ADB\u2019s  2008  Country  Programming  Mission  confirmed  inclusion  of  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Higher Education Sector Development Project \nduring 2008, with an ensuing loan programmed in 2009.2 A fact-finding mission to Viet Nam in \nApril  2008  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome, \noutputs, scope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing plan, and outline terms \nof reference for the consultants.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.    Viet Nam is one of the rapidly growing economies in Asia, recording an average annual \ngrowth in gross domestic product (GDP) of about 7.5% over the last decade and 8.5% in 2007. \nThe country\u2019s success in reducing the general poverty incidence is remarkable. The latest \nhousehold survey data shows that the income poverty incidence fell from 58.1% in 1993 to \n19.5%  in  2004.  The  Government\u2019s  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u201320104 \nenvisions  Viet  Nam  as  \u201can  industrialized  country  by  2020,\u201d  moving  the  country  out  of  its \nlow-income status and increasing average GDP per capita (about $723 in 2006) to $1,100 by \n2010. An initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \n3.    To  progress  beyond  middle-income  country  status  by  2010  and  become  an \nindustrialized country by 2020, however, Viet Nam must accelerate building its knowledge and \ntechnological  capacity  and  greatly  improve  its  business  climate.  The  Government,  having \nrecently  joined  the  World  Trade  Organization,  is  committed  to  promoting  knowledge-led \ndevelopment and fostering a skilled population with strong knowledge and a technological basis \nthat will position the country well for expansion and integration with the global economy. The \nSEDP  recognizes  that  education  and  knowledge  are  fundamental  to  social  and  economic \ndevelopment, and it aims to proactively invest to equip citizens with the knowledge, skills, and \nattitudes needed to compete economically in a rapidly changing society. Building high-quality \nhigher education institutions (HEIs) that are innovative and relevant to market demands is \nessential. HEIs can operate as incubators for the innovation and creative thinking needed for an \neconomically  competitive  society  by  carrying  out  research  and  development  (R&D)  and \ndeveloping human resources for a knowledge-based economy.  \n \n4.    The Government has set overall quantitative and qualitative goals for higher education \ndevelopment in its SEDP. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), which manages and \nregulates the higher education system in the country, has elaborated on these goals in its \nHigher  Education  Reform  Agenda,  2006\u20132020.5 The  reform  agenda  advances  a  forward-\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 May 2008.  \n3  In accordance with the Government\u2019s request, a joint TA Fact-Finding (ADB) and Identification (the World Bank) \nMission was fielded during 2\u201311 April 2008.  \n4  Government of Viet Nam. 2006.

Vietnam Higher Education Reform Agenda, 2006\u20132020. Hanoi.  \n ", "2   \nlooking strategy for developing a highly competitive higher education system with advanced \nresearch and teaching capacity as driving forces for the knowledge-based economy. The main \nobjectives  of  the  strategy  are  to  (i)  dramatically  increase  the  participation  rate  in  HEIs, \n(ii) simultaneously boost quality and efficiency of the higher education system, (iii) strengthen \nresearch capacity in HEIs in order to upgrade the quality of teaching and to provide a research \nbase for the development of industry and enterprises, and (iv) improve governance of the \nhigher education system. MOET faces tremendous challenges, however, in meeting specific \ntargets in the higher education reform agenda, which include (i) developing key HEIs into major \nscientific  centers  for  the  entire  country  by  growing  income  from  science  and  technology \nactivities (services and products) to 15% of the total HEI revenue by 2010, and to 25% by \n2020; (ii) increasing enrollment to 200 students per 10,000 population by 2010, and to 450 \nstudents per 10,000 population by 2020; (iii) raising the proportion of university teaching staff \nwith master\u2019s level degrees to 40% by 2010, and to 60% by 2020; (iv) raising the proportion of \nuniversity teaching staff with doctorate level degrees to 25% by 2010, and to 35% by 2020; \nand (v) reducing the ratio of university students to teaching staff to 20:1 by 2020. \n \n5.    There are now more than 1.3 million Vietnamese enrolled in 230 HEIs. Although the \ngross enrollment rate has risen from a mere 2% in the early 1990s to about 13% in 2005, it is \nstill well below those of other high-performing countries in the region. To improve efficiency, \nHEIs  have  become  more  multidisciplinary  through  the  formation  of  larger  universities. \nNevertheless, the sector is still dominated by smaller HEIs that remain very specialized as a \nlegacy from the influence of the former Soviet Union\u2019s higher education model. Despite the \nGovernment\u2019s goal to improve the quality of higher education, quality assurance measures \nremain in a nascent stage. There is also a relevance issue in that the knowledge and skills of \nhigher education graduates need to be better aligned with labor market demand. At the same \ntime, the country requires measures to prevent or reverse brain drain. In spite of a gradual \nincrease in their autonomy and decision-making authority in some areas, HEIs still have little \nexperience in managing themselves or pursuing institution-specific goals. MOET and the sector \nministries  continue  to  make  most  of  the  management  decisions.  Furthermore,  institutional \nfunding is insufficient and there is heavy reliance on public funds. More private funding needs to \nbe  mobilized  by  promoting  private  and  foreign  universities\u2019  entry  into  the  sector  and \nstrengthening university\u2013industry linkages.   \n \n6.   The  Prime  Minister  places  the  highest  priority  on  developing  world-class  research \nuniversities to drive the country\u2019s knowledge-based economy. MOET aims to have at least one \nVietnamese HEI recognized and ranked as one of the world\u2019s top 200 universities by 2020. \nMOET seeks (i) investment financing to develop four \u201cnew model\u201d research universities as \ncenters of excellence in research and teaching with strong university\u2013industry linkages in the \nnorthern (Ha Noi), central (Da Nang), southern (Ho Chi Minh City), and Mekong River Delta \n(Can Tho) regions; and (ii) technical assistance to design a \u201cnew model\u201d HEI with a new policy \nand regulatory framework to provide enabling conditions for closer university\u2013industry linkages \nand for possible replication once proven successful. As envisaged in the higher education \nreform agenda, these new model research universities are expected to become core scientific \ncenters  for  the  entire  country.  They  will  be  more  research-oriented  and  aligned  with \ninternational  standards  of  quality,  relevance,  and  competitiveness.  They  will  productively \nabsorb  the  many  PhD  graduates  returning  to  Viet  Nam  from  overseas  universities  and \nresearch institutes, play a critical role in research and teaching, and lead to enhanced R&D \ncapacity of the country.  \n \n ", "  3\n7.    While development of the overall policy framework for the higher education system is \nsupported by the World Bank,6 it is necessary to ensure, in collaboration with the World Bank, \nthat the overall policy development process is efficient and relevant to new model research \nuniversities. In addition, a specific policy framework plus new mechanisms and procedures \nneed to be developed in governance, finance, and quality assurance to make the proposed \nfour research universities fully effective, autonomous, and competitive. Policy development will \nrequire improvements in the areas of (i) governance, in terms of choice of university leaders, \nrecruitment, compensation and management of academic and administrative staff, admissions, \nchoice of study programs and degrees, and choice of research topics; (ii) financing, including \ntuition and a student loan scheme, a competitive research grant scheme, and incentives for \ngreater nonpublic funding; and (iii) quality assurance, including additional resources linked to \nhigher  performance  standards,  accountability  through  financial  and  academic  audits,  and \nestablishment of an independent accreditation agency or body. Major investments in modern \nfacilities, advanced research laboratories, and strong library holdings are also required to \ndeliver the necessary improvement in quality, relevance, and competitiveness. \n \n8.  At the tertiary education level, ADB supported establishment of the Royal Melbourne \nInstitute of Technology in Ho Chi Minh City as a private sector operation in 2001,7 and it is \nsupporting teacher training universities and colleges for secondary and professional teachers.8 \nADB has also supported higher education projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  Mongolia,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Thailand  (at  the \npostgraduate level). Major lessons learned include that (i) basic research is more challenging \ndue to the time and type of products and resources required; (ii) the expanding global market for \npostgraduate degree holders, and resulting brain drain, needs to be anticipated; and (iii) the \ncapacities of HEIs need strengthening to promote internal and external efficiency and to be \nresponsive to industry\u2019s needs.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.    The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  two  new  model  research  universities  in  Ha  Noi  and \nDa Nang with high-quality postgraduate programs and R&D capacity in key disciplines. The \noutcome of the TA will be an agreed design for a loan project for developing two universities \nand a related policy and regulatory framework that is suitable for ADB financing.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.   The outputs of the TA will be (i) an assessment of higher education development models \nin various countries and higher education sector constraints and issues; (ii) a design for the \noverall policy framework for research universities within the higher education system and the \npolicy  and  regulatory  framework  specific  to  the  new  model  universities;  (iii)  strategic  road \nmapping to reach international standards of quality, relevance, and competitiveness; (iv) a \ncompleted project outline that addresses key sector constraints and issues and meets the \n                                                 \n6  World Bank. 2007.

The TA will engage a wide range of public and private representatives in a dialogue to \nexplore ways of creating university\u2013industry linkages. The TA will focus on developing model \nresearch universities with initial focus on science and technology disciplines to enhance long-\nterm industrial productivity and economic competitiveness. The TA will help prepare a road map \nfor developing these universities into centers of excellence located strategically in or near \nhigh-technology parks or industrial zones.9 The \u201cHa Noi Science and Technology University\u201d \nand the \u201cViet Nam\u2013German University\u201d in Ho Chi Minh City will be newly established. The \nuniversities in Can Tho and Da Nang will likely be developed from existing universities in these \nlocations. ADB will support the \u201cHa Noi Science and Technology University,\u201d to be located in the \nHoa Lac High Tech Park, and the Da Nang university subproject to be located next to the Dien \nNam Industrial Zone. The World Bank will support the \u201cViet Nam\u2013German University\u201d in Ho Chi \nMinh City and the Can Tho university subproject.    \n \n12.  The TA will conduct a project feasibility study for the two new model universities in Ha \nNoi and Da Nang, including a sector assessment, by examining higher education models in \nother countries and identifying higher education sector constraints and issues. It will create a \nstrategic road map to reach international standards of quality, relevance, and competitiveness. \nThe TA will also develop a proposal for a specific policy and regulatory framework appropriate \nto  all  new  model  research  universities.  In  this  connection,  the  TA  will  provide  support  in \ndetermining,  among  other  things:  (i)  governance  arrangements,  (ii)  level  of  autonomy, \n(iii) accountability requirements and mechanisms, (iv) financing arrangements (including salary \nstructures and incentive mechanisms), (v) quality assurance arrangements, (vi) management \nstaff  and  faculty  recruitment  arrangements,  and  (vii)  student  recruitment  arrangements \n(including  equity  concerns).  Furthermore,  the  TA  will  examine  and  propose  a  project \nmanagement and implementation arrangement. In view of lessons learned, it will include project \nreadiness or bridging assistance to facilitate the project start-up activities (e.g., recruitment of \nconsultants, preparation of bidding documents). \n \n13.  The proposed project will likely have the following outputs (to be designed in close \ncollaboration with MOET, the new model universities, the private sector, and with development \npartners that include in particular the World Bank and bilateral agencies): (i) a policy and \nregulatory  framework  for  implementing  specific  arrangements  for  new  model  universities\u2019 \ngovernance, financing, and quality assurance procedures that are in harmony with the higher \neducation system\u2019s overall policy and regulatory framework; (ii) university establishment and \ndevelopment, including to design and build the facilities, equip the two new model universities, \nestablish management systems, and develop and deliver a training program for leadership, \nmanagement, and teaching and research staff to meet the industry\u2019s needs; and (iii) project \nimplementation management, which will manage the project, coordinate project activities, and \nmonitor performance and results.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000. ADB will finance $1,000,000 equivalent. The TA \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \n                                                 \n9  High-tech park means \u201ca zone which specializes in research, development and application of high technologies \nand which provides a centre for fostering high-tech enterprises, for training human resources in high technologies \nand for manufacturing and trading high-tech products.\u201d Industrial zone means \u201ca zone which specializes in the \nmanufacture of industrial products and the provision of services for industrial manufacture.\u201d National Assembly of \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. 2006.

The remaining $200,000 will be contributed by the Government and will include office \naccommodation, utilities, remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff, local transportation \nfor support staff, and administration support. The Government has been informed that approval \nof  the  TA does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  ensuing  project. The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  Project  Management.  MOET  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  responsible  for \nproviding counterpart support. A project preparation unit will be established in MOET with a \nqualified TA project manager and project staff acceptable to ADB and having skills across the \nrange of issues that will be covered during project preparation. The project preparation unit will \ninclude representatives from each of the four university subproject teams, and manage both \nADB and the World Bank TA teams. Office space will be allocated by MOET and concerned \nuniversity subprojects. Overall guidance for both ADB and the World Bank TA projects will be \nthe responsibility of an interministerial project advisory committee to be chaired by the vice \nminister of MOET in charge of higher education. The committee will comprise representatives \nfrom MOET, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Science and \nTechnology,  the  Office  of  the  Government,  and  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam.  It  will  invite \nrepresentatives of the four university subproject teams to participate in its meetings.  \n \n16.  Consulting Services. A team of 11 international consultants totaling 33 person-months \nand 15 national consultants totaling 64 person-months will provide the following expertise: \n(i) university governance, financing, and quality assurance; (ii) university campus development; \n(iii)  curriculum  development  and  academic  design;  (iv)  facilities  and  laboratory  design; \n(v) economic and financial analysis and management, and project costing; (vi) project planning \nand  management;  (vii)  civil  works  (architect  and  engineer);  (viii)  procurement;  (ix)  gender \nanalysis; (x) resettlement; (xi) environmental assessment; and (xii) monitoring and evaluation. \nADB will select and engage consultants through a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n  1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nViet Nam has been one of the rapidly growing economies in Asia, recording an average annual growth in gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) of about 7.5% over the last decade and 8.5% in 2007. The country\u2019s success in reducing general poverty \nincidence is remarkable. Viet Nam has achieved continuous poverty reduction, with the proportion of households living below \nthe poverty line falling to 19.5% in 2004 compared with 58.1% in 1993 (Household Survey, 2006). The Government has \nprepared its Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010, which is also Viet Nam\u2019s national poverty reduction \nstrategy. The SEDP envisions Viet Nam as \u201can industrialized country by 2020,\u201d moving out of its low-income country status by \nincreasing average GDP per capita from about $732 in 2006 to the rank of middle-income countries (at $1,100) in 2010. \nFurthermore, the Government has set a goal of becoming an industrialized country by 2020 by greatly strengthening its human \nknowledge base and technological capacity.    \n \nThe country strategy and program (CSP) 2007\u20132010 supports the Government\u2019s SEDP, focusing on three priorities for \nassistance: (i) business-led, pro-poor economic growth; (ii) social equity; and (iii) environment. Under the first priority, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will help the Government to improve the business-enabling environment by developing financial and \nrelated market institutions and human resources needed to meet increasing demand for skilled workers and by increasing labor \nproductivity. At the same time, the poverty assessment in the CSP 2007\u20132010 endorsed the contribution of economic growth to \npoverty reduction. In particular, higher education institutions can operate as incubators of innovation and creative thinking \nneeded for an economically competitive society by carrying out research and development (R&D) and by developing human \nresources for a knowledge-based economy. The technical assistance (TA) and proposed project, which will prepare, establish, \nand develop new model research universities that are world-class in their quality and competitiveness, are in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s SEDP and ADB\u2019s CSP 2007\u20132010. The development of a responsive, innovative, and high-quality higher \neducation system is essential to the demands of the market and will pave the way toward an industrialized country by 2020.   \n \nB.  Targeting Classification          \n1.   Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H)  Geographic (TI-G)  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n    2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe TA will prepare an investment project to establish and develop new model research universities in the \u201ctiered\u201d higher \neducation system meeting international standards of quality and competitiveness. These will enhance the country\u2019s capacity for \nR&D and the production of highly qualified graduates (and especially in science and technology disciplines). The proposed \nproject is envisaged to reduce poverty in an indirect manner through creating new model research universities as centers of \nresearch and teaching excellence with strong university\u2013industry linkages. That, in turn, will contribute to business-led, pro-poor \neconomic growth.   \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n    1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \nNot applicable.  \n \n  2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \n \nA national gender and ethnic minority specialist, under the guidance of the project team member in charge of social \ndevelopment and gender aspects, will be engaged to conduct poverty analysis.  \n      \n ", "      Appendix 2  9 \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe proposed project aims at developing new model research universities as centers of research and teaching excellence with \nstrong university\u2013industry linkages. This should create potential for pro-poor growth. In addition, the design of the proposed \nproject will consider such socially inclusive measures as affirmative admission criteria, level of student tuition, and student \nfinancial assistance schemes favoring students from poor households.    \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nThe potential primary beneficiaries will be the upper secondary school graduates and graduates of existing universities\u2014both \nin-country and overseas\u2014who will have access to new model research universities meeting international standards of quality \nand competitiveness. Other primary beneficiaries include new faculty members to be recruited from existing universities in-\ncountry and overseas. The poor and the socially excluded can have access to new model universities through affirmative \nadmission criteria, as well as due to a student tuition scheme and a student financial assistance scheme ensuring that all \nqualified students will be admitted irrespective of their ability to pay tuition and other related costs.      \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nThe potential needs of beneficiaries include the level of autonomy in university governance, flexibility and equity in the financial \nmechanism, and transparency and accountability in the quality assurance system.   \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \nThe Government and university authorities may not be fully aware of the required level of autonomy in university governance, \nflexibility in the financial mechanism, and transparency and accountability in the quality assurance system that would enable \nnew model research universities to reach international standards of quality and competitiveness. The PPTA will assess various \nhigher education development models and draw lessons for developing a specific policy and regulatory framework suitable to \nnew model research universities in terms of governance, financing, and quality assurance, and the proposed project will help \nthe Government and universities to implement the specific policy and regulatory framework.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n  1.   Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nUpper secondary and undergraduate education age cohorts will be the potential initial stakeholders. Education decision \nmakers, planners and managers, and university subproject teams comprising university administrators and faculty members will \nbe involved in the project, both as the executing and implementing agencies and as beneficiaries of the project activities. The \nprivate sector will also be involved in the project through (i) representation on decision-making committees; (ii) involvement in \nprogram definition, curriculum design, and thesis panels; and (iii) hiring teaching staff from enterprises.         \n \n  2.  What type of consultation and participation is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nDuring the PPTA, the following seminars and workshops will be conducted: (i) inception, midterm, and final seminars involving \nall the project stakeholders; (ii) a workshop involving decision makers, planners, managers, and representatives from the \nprivate sector on the specific policy and regulatory framework; and (iii) focused group workshops involving university subproject \nstakeholders in Ha Noi and Da Nang.    \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nA separate consultation and participation plan is not required. ADB has already started stakeholder consultations with the \ncentral and provincial governments, university representatives, the private sector, and other development partners (in particular \nwith  the  World  Bank).  Furthermore,  consultation  and  participation  processes  will  be  mainstreamed  in  relevant  project \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \ncomponents and documents such as the resettlement plan, initial environmental examination, and gender action plan.  \n \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or program? \n \nKey gender issues are: (i) a gender imbalance in educational attainment which exists at the upper secondary and tertiary \nlevels, as fewer girls than boys are enrolled at these levels of the education system except for professional secondary \neducation, and this gap widens drastically between the majority of Kinh boys and ethnic minority girls; and (ii) a gender \nimbalance in teaching staff at the tertiary level, with fewer female teachers than male teachers. It should be noted that in some \nscience and technology fields, however, female students show better academic performance than male students.    \n \n2.  Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision making?     \nYes          No    Please explain.  \n \nThe proposed project aims to (i) introduce admission criteria that will encourage enrollments by female students in general, (ii) \ngive special consideration to student tuition and financial assistance schemes for qualified ethnic minority female students, and \n(iii) put priority on hiring qualified female faculty members.     \n \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality?       \n  Yes          No    Please explain. \n \nThe proposed project aims to establish a nondiscriminatory environment for female students and faculty members.  \n \nIII.
