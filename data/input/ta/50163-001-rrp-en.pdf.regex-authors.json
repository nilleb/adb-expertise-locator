THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nsenior debt facilities of up to $150 million (in Indian rupee equivalent) to Janalakshmi Financial \nServices Private Limited (JFS). JFS will use the proceeds of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfunding to finance microfinance loans, predominately loans to women customers under the joint \nliability group (JLG) model, as well as other small loans to individuals and micro and small \nenterprises. Up to 5% of the ADB facility will be specifically dedicated to loans for building and \nimproving sanitation facilities (e.g., toilets and septic tanks) throughout India.  \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Economy. Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an average annual rate of \n7.8% from FY2005 to FY2015, helping the country reduce poverty from 37.2% in FY2005 to 21.9% \nin FY2012.1 Although India weathered the global financial crisis relatively well, growth slackened \nduring FY2012\u2013FY2014 as a result of tighter monetary policy to counter persistently high inflation, \nlack of consensus on some policy and regulatory issues, and the adverse effects of a decrease \nin global demand.2 Growth rebounded during FY2015, helped by increased political certainty, \nseveral policy actions, lower commodity (oil and non-oil) import prices, improved business and \nconsumer confidence, and reduced external vulnerabilities. GDP growth was 7.3% for FY2015. \nStable policy, lower commodity prices, increasing government spending on infrastructure while \nmaintaining the fiscal deficit and a supportive monetary policy are expected to boost real GDP \ngrowth to 7.4% in FY2016 and 7.8% in FY2017. The Indian economy is expected to grow by 8.0% \nover the next 5 years. However, the sustainability of high growth rates will depend on continuing \nto address supply-side bottlenecks and structural challenges through legislative changes and \npolicy implementation.3    \n \n3.  Financial sector overview. The Indian financial sector is still developing with banks \ndominating the sector. As of December 2015, there were 214 banks, including 147 scheduled \ncommercial banks. As of 31 December 2015, the total deposits of all scheduled commercial banks \nstood at Rs91.3 trillion and total credit stood at Rs69.9 trillion.4 As of the end of FY2015 \n(FYE2015), 11,842 nonbank finance companies (NBFCs) were registered with the Reserve Bank \nof India (RBI), with total assets of Rs14.6 trillion (for NBFCs with assets of Rs1 billion and above).5 \nNotwithstanding the size of the financial sector and the significant strides the government is \nmaking in this sector, including the successful Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana scheme (Prime \nMinister\u2019s People Money Scheme)6, access to credit in India remains a key issue. Gross \nnonperforming assets (NPAs) for the banking sector (according to the RBI\u2019s definition) worsened \nfrom 3.5% in FY2013 to 4.6% in FY2015 and 5.1% as of 30 September 2015. Loans undergoing \nrestructuring also increased during the same period, rising from 5.5% to 6.2%. The capital \nadequacy ratio of the banking sector declined from 14.0% in FY2013 to 12.7% as of 30 September \n2015. The gross NPAs for the NBFC sector increased from 1.5% in FY2013 to 3.4% in FY2015 \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015.

Microfinance sector overview. As of 31 December 2015, the microfinance sector in India \nhas provided microcredit to close to 28.8 million customers through 9,503 branches across the \ncountry,  disbursing  25.1  million  loans  amounting  to  $6.2  billion  (average  loan  size  of \napproximately $261). During FY2012\u2013FY2015, the sector had a compound annual growth rate \n(CAGR) of 44.9% in disbursements and a 40.8% CAGR in the gross loan portfolio. Strong growth \ncontinued over the first 9 months of FY2016, with disbursements rising by 72.2%, while the \naggregate gross loan portfolio growth increased by 75.6% over the previous year.8 CRISIL \nResearch, a ratings agency, expects the aggregate microfinance institution (MFI) loan portfolio to \ngrow by 30.0%\u201334.0% annually over the next 5 years. Problem loans among MFIs decreased \nquite significantly from 2.32% in FY2012 to 0.25% in FY2015 for 30 days past due.9 More recently, \nhowever, portfolio at risk for 30 days (PAR 30) rose slightly to 0.42% as of 31 December 2015 \nagainst 0.38% as of 31 December 2014. CRISIL Research expects the profitability of MFIs to fall \nmarginally in relation to earlier years because of the introduction of caps on lending rates.10 The \nnet profit margin for the sector is expected to fall from 3.6% to 3.3% during FY2014-FY2017.11 In \nSeptember 2015, to promote financial inclusion and access to credit, the RBI awarded in-principle \nsmall finance bank (SFB) licenses to 10 applicants, of which eight were MFIs. The awardees have \n18 months to comply with the various requirements and start banking operations.  \n \n5.  Rationale.  Access  to  finance  in  India  remains  a  key  issue,  with  47.0%  of  people \nunbanked. Access to credit is even more limited, with less than 14.0% of borrowers accessing \ncredit through formal channels.12 Given the continued need to address access to finance and \naccess to credit issues for many customer segments in India, ADB has sought to identify financial \ninstitution partners that have demonstrated the ability to reach underbanked segments on a \nprofitable  and  sustainable  basis.  JFS\u2019s  deep understanding  of  its  customer  segments  and \ncomprehensive  underwriting  systems  have  enabled  it  to  maintain  solid  asset  quality  and \nprofitability while achieving above industry average growth rates. The proposed transaction seeks \nto support JFS\u2019s growth as it transitions into a pan-India (urban and rural) SFB and looks to \ndiversify and increase the tenor of its liabilities, while it builds its deposit franchise, and in doing \nso, support JFS as it furthers its mandate of financial inclusion, in line with Government of India \nprograms. The proposed transaction also seeks to support the development and deployment of \nsanitation loans that complement the government\u2019s sanitation initiatives. More than 53.0% of \nhouseholds in India do not have a household toilet and over 50.0% of the population defecates in \nopen spaces. In addition to the spread of disease and various health issues across the wider \npopulation  that  result  from  mismanagement  of  waste,  women  are  particularly  affected\u2014as \nevidenced by girl school dropout rates and the heightened risk of sexual molestation and violence \n                                                \n7  RBI. 2015.

It introduced these caps in February 2014, replacing the previous overall \ninterest rate cap of 26%. Small finance banks (SFBs) do not need to adhere to these margin caps.   \n11 CRISIL Research. 2014. Tailwinds gather for rural banking rebound. November. Mumbai. \n12 World Bank. 2015.

The level of unbanked people in India has \ndeclined from 65% in 2011 following the launch by the Government of India of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana \nscheme, which aims to open 100 million bank accounts for poor families; as of 6 April 2016, more than 215 million \naccounts have been opened under the scheme. \n \n ", "3 \n \nwhen relieving themselves at night or dawn in unsafe locations.

Founded in 2000 as an offshoot of the Sanhamithra Urban Program, an \nincubated microfinance initiative, JFS is currently India\u2019s largest NBFC-MFI, providing market-\nbased financial services to underserved customers in urban India. With a diversified presence in \n18 states throughout the country, reaching over 3.8 million customers in 331 Jana Centres and \n50 Jana Pragati Centres, JFS had assets under management of over $1.7 billion as of the end of \nMarch 2016.13 JFS is assisted in this effort by Jana Urban Foundation, its (Section 8) nonprofit \nholding  company,  which  undertakes  client-centric  analytical  research activities  that  deepen \nunderstanding of the challenges of financial inclusion. In line with JFS\u2019s long-term strategic focus \nof developing a platform to provide a full range of financial products and services for the urban \npoor,  the  RBI  awarded  JFS  an  in-principle  SFB  license  in  September  2015.  Under  RBI \nregulations, SFBs are allowed to undertake normal banking operations, including deposit taking, \nbut are mandated to focus on smaller inclusive loans, with at least 50.0% of the loan portfolio \nconstituting loans of less than $37,000 and a minimum of 75.0% of the loan portfolio directed \ntoward priority sector lending (against 40.0% for standard banks). JFS is expected to be awarded \nthe final license and commence banking operations in July 2016.   \n \n7.  JFS has two core business units: Retail Financial Services and Enterprise Financial \nServices.14 As part of its transition to an SFB, it will add two additional business lines: Payments-\nPlus and Inclusions-Adjacencies (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Janalakshmi Financial Services Business Lines \nBusiness Line  Description \nRetail Financial Services  Retail financial services include such loan products as micro loans to JLGs (small \nbatch); loans used for education, housing, and home improvement; and loans to \nindividuals that have graduated from the group loan structure to support working \ncapital, and capital investment needs for their businesses (Nano Loan). JFS also \noffers retail fee based products such as micro pensions, reloadable prepaid cards, \nand a goal-based savings plan. \nEnterprise Financial  Enterprise financial services offer loan products to MSMEs for working capital and \nServices  investment needs, such as the purchase of machinery. JFS also offers the Super \nNano Loan to customers that have graduated from the individual Nano Loan cycle.  \nPayment-Plus  This vertical will focus on providing products and fee-based services involving \ndigital payment processes. \nInclusions-Adjacencies   Public finance vertical that will finance sustainable urban infrastructure projects in \n(Other Businesses)  fields viewed as integral to inclusion such as sanitation or waste management \nservices,  affordable housing  development,  and  renewable  energy.  Also  rural \nfinance. \nJFS = Janalakshmi Financial Services, JLG = joint liability group. \nSource: Janalakshmi Financial Services. \n \n8.  Business strategy. Driven by its long-term strategy to develop a scalable platform to \nservice the financial needs of the urban poor by offering the complete value chain of financial \nproducts and services, JFS has formulated successive business plans that focus on this core \n                                                \n13 JFS branches are well distributed across the southern (27%), northern (29%), western (27%), and eastern (17%) \nstates of India. \n14 It is compulsory for all JFS borrowers to obtain life insurance for the period of the loan. All housing loan customers \nare required to participate in a group property insurance plan and all livestock loan customers must obtain livestock \ninsurance. \n \n ", "4 \n \nobjective. The foundations for JFS\u2019s establishment were laid out in its Jana 1.0 Strategic Plan \n(2005\u20132009), as the company initiated operations as a microfinance provider. Initially focusing on \nproviding group microfinance lending under the JLG scheme, central to JFS\u2019s evolution has been \nthe interconnection of three key factors: technology, human capital, and communication.15 JFS\u2019s \nJana 2.0 Strategic Plan (2010\u20132014) focused on expanding the range of its product offerings \nbeyond  JLG-based  microfinance  loans,  as  well  as  scaling  its  operations  by  expanding  its \ngeographical footprint to the national level. Under the Jana 3.0 Strategic Plan (2014\u20132015), JFS \nsought to enhance the capacity of the pillars of its foundation\u2014technology, human capital, and \ncommunication\u2014given the rapid expansion of its operations in terms of both product offerings \nand its distribution network. On all three fronts, JFS has partnered with leading global institutions \n(including Accenture and IBM) to obtain the expertise needed to advance JFS\u2019s mandate and \noperational capacity. With the awarding of its in-principle SFB license, JFS\u2019s Jana 4.0 Strategic \nPlan (2015 to present) refines the core building blocks of its operating model as the company \ntransitions.  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n9.  Ownership. Integrity due diligence has been conducted on JFS in accordance with the \nIntegrity Due Diligence Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations.16The largest single shareholding \nin JFS (20.54%) is held by Jana Urban Foundation, a nonprofit organization, which will change to \nJana Holdings Limited in August 2016. In light of new regulations allowing JFS to become an \nSFB, JFS is now creating a three-tiered structure similar to other SFBs because of limitations on \nforeign ownership. JFS\u2019s founder, Ramesh Ramanathan and his family\u2019s shares are held by Jana \nUrban Foundation. Seven private equity funds hold about 73.63% of JFS\u2019s shares, of which four \nfunds are established by large institutional investors\u2014Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, TPG Capital, \nand Tata Capital.  \n \n10.  The private equity funds holding shares in JFS in Singapore and Mauritius are typical for \nfunds investing in India, since India has a double taxation avoidance agreement with both \nMauritius and Singapore. Both of these jurisdictions are rated as largely compliant with the \ninternational tax  standard  of  exchange  of  information  on request  by the  Global  Forum  on \nTransparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. Citigroup\u2019s funds incorporated in \nMauritius are held through funds established in the Cayman Islands and Jersey. India does not \nhave double taxation agreements with the Cayman Islands and Jersey, but none of the countries \nis listed by the Financial Action Task Force as a strategically deficient jurisdiction. None of the \nultimate beneficial owners of the private equity funds have been identified, as the private equity \nfunds are well established in jurisdictions not identified to be deficient or noncompliant. JFS relies \non the reputation of these funds for the investments. ADB is not in a position to obtain further \ndetails of the funds, to identify these ultimate beneficial owners, or to consider if tax exchange \nagreements are in place for the relevant jurisdiction. ADB\u2019s review of the funds does not give ADB \ncause to believe that it has been established, or is being used for cross-border tax evasion, money \nlaundering, or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the project. Integrity due diligence \nfindings indicated that a politically exposed person is an independent member of the BOD, but \ntheir involvement does not appear to pose any integrity risk. Other information related to the \nprivate equity fund investors and investment bank general partners  was discovered during \nintegrity due diligence, but nothing was outside of the normal course of business and nothing was \nproject related. Due diligence did not find any apparent significant or potentially significant integrity \nissues. \n                                                \n15 A joint liability group  is an informal group of between 10 to 20 members (typically women), coming together for the \npurposes of taking out bank loan either singly or through a group mechanism against a mutual guarantee. \n16 http://www.adb.org/documents/integrity-principles-and-guidelines. \n ", "5 \n \n \n11.  Corporate governance. JFS\u2019s board of directors (BOD) is responsible for the strategic \ndirection, policy setting, and supervision of the company\u2019s performance, as well as ensuring its \ncompliance with laws and regulations. It is composed of professional members and leaders from \nthe banking, finance, and business segments as well as from microfinance investment funds and \nsocial investors. Of the 16 members, five are independent directors, eight are investor directors, \nand the remaining three are executive directors. The BOD is chaired by JFS\u2019s promoter, Ramesh \nRamanathan, a former banker (Citibank), and supported by a system of appointed committees \n(asset-liability  committee,  audit,  risk  and  credit,  borrowing,  nomination  and  remuneration, \ncorporate social responsibility).  \n \n12.  Management. JFS\u2019s 10-member executive management team is responsible for the day-\nto-day management of the company, as well as overseeing the transition of the NBFC MFI into \nan  SFB.  Business  lines\u2014Retail  Financial  Services  and  Enterprise  Financial  Services\u2014are \nheaded by former corporate credit bankers with over 20 years of experience. \n \n13.  Risk management. JFS is governed by a BOD-approved risk management policy that \noversees all aspects of risk including credit, operational, market, liquidity, interest rate, and \ncompliance risks. The BOD Risk Management Committee is updated quarterly on company risks \nby the chief risk officer, who manages the day-to-day functioning of the Risk Management \nDepartment. JFS has developed an integrated risk management approach, with well-defined \ncontrol systems in place. The first level of controls is built through the operations processes, with \na focus on business tracking to ensure quality assurance and successful collection. Monitoring\u2014\nthrough credit risk management, operations and compliance risk management, and fraud risk \nmanagement\u2014is the second level of controls. Loan processing and approval processes are \ncentralized at central processing centers, with a maker\u2013checker concept at every stage. Internal \naudit is viewed as the third level of control, with independent quarterly audits of the branches \nundertaken on five major parameters: client acquisition, disbursements, recovery, systems and \nprocesses, and cash management. JFS\u2019s risk management framework is supported by a digitized, \ndata-driven performance management system based on the balanced scorecard methodology, \nwhich covers both entity performance management and individual performance management.17  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s debt financing up to $150 million (in Indian rupee equivalent) will be provided to \nJFS in one or both of the following modalities described in Table 2: \n \nTable 2: Financing Modalities \nStructure Options  Nonconvertible Debentures  Bilateral Loan  \n (3\u20135 years)  (3\u20135 years) \nOn or Offshore  Onshore domestic debenture\u2014senior  Onshore senior unsecured loan\u2014settled \nunsecured, settled in Indian rupees  in Indian rupees \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14.

ADB\u2019s financing will be senior \nunsecured, with recourse on the JFS balance sheet. ADB is also providing technical assistance \nunder the regional Technical Assistance for Business Development and Implementation Support \nfor Nonsovereign Operations project in an amount of up to $250,000 to support the development \nof sanitation loan prototypes, a crucial need in India. 19,20 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  Use of proceeds. JFS will use the proceeds of the ADB funding to finance microfinance \nloans, predominately loans to women customers under the JLG model, as well as other small \nloans to individuals and micro and small enterprises. In addition, up to 5% of the ADB facility will \nbe dedicated to loans for building and improving sanitation facilities throughout India. Some 50% \nof the funding will target less developed states, as classified in the Raghuram Rajan Panel Report, \n2013.21   \n \n16.  Monitoring and reporting. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will carry out \nproject monitoring. JFS will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular intervals \nand as requested. These will include (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis, \n(ii) audited financial statements on an annual basis, (iii) compliance certificates for financial \ncovenants on a quarterly basis, (iv) reporting on the microfinance and sanitation loan portfolios \non a semiannual basis, and (v) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed by \nADB and the borrower. \n \n17.  Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly and at \nleast  annually.  The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n18.  Supporting  access  to  finance  and  financial  sector  development. The  proposed \ntransaction seeks to support JFS\u2019s growth as it transitions into a pan-India (urban and rural) SFB \nand looks to diversify its liabilities while it builds its deposit franchise. As wholesale bank funding \nwill no longer be available to JFS as an SFB, ADB support will provide stable, longer-term funding \nas JFS transitions. In addition, ADB\u2019s funding will underpin JFS\u2019s mandate to provide a complete \nrange of products and services to address the financial needs of the underserved, which are not \nbeing  met  by  mainstream  financial  institutions,  and  thereby  complement  the  government\u2019s \nobjective to increase financial inclusion.  \n \n19.  Supporting  development  of  the  sanitation  sector.  The  proposed  transaction,  in \ncombination  with  the technical  assistance,  will  help  to  develop  and  deploy  sanitation  loan \nprototypes that can be used by financial institutions throughout India as a complement to the \ngovernment\u2019s sanitation initiatives.  \n \nIV.

The expected impact of the transaction will be that access to finance for the \nunderserved is increased in alignment with the Government of India\u2019s 12th Five Year Plan, 2012\u2013\n2017, which highlights the delivery of banking and other financial services at affordable costs to \ndisadvantaged and low-income groups as a means to promote poverty reduction and inclusive \ngrowth through employment generation.22 In addition, sanitation services in India are improved in \nalignment  with  the  government\u2019s  Swachh  Bharat  Abhiyan  Policy,  which  seeks  to  provide \nsanitation services to the mass population. \n \n21.  Outcomes. The expected outcome of the transaction will be that sustainability of JFS\u2019s \nlending activities for the underserved is demonstrated as it transitions to an SFB. \n \n22.  Outputs. The expected outputs from the transaction will be (i) increased JFS capacity for \nmicrofinance lending as evidenced by (a) active microfinance loan accounts increasing to 24.6 \nmillion by FY2024 (baseline 4.6 million, FY2016); (b) active microfinance loan accounts to women \nincreasing to 24.6 million by FY2024 (baseline 4.6 million, FY2016); and (c) at least 50% of the \nloans made using ADB funding be directed to less developed states; and (ii) increased JFS \noperations in sanitation as evidenced by (a) active sanitation loans reaching 206,000 by FY2024 \n(baseline: not applicable); and (b) share of sanitation loans as a percentage of the total loan \nportfolio increasing to 1% by FY2024 (FY2016 baseline: not applicable). \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n23.  The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support to the financial sector \nby  helping  to  develop  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services.  The \nproposed transaction contributes to financial sector development by supporting the growth of an \nSFB, an important component of the financial sector in India. 23 The Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020 also seeks to promote inclusive growth. Without access to formal financial services, lower \nincome people or underserved segments will be excluded from the growth process and its \nbenefits. According to the India country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign \noperations will continue to support the infrastructure and financial sectors by undertaking selective \nprojects  for  physical  and  social  infrastructure  and  financial  infrastructure.24 The  proposed \ntransaction  will  support  the  development  of  microfinance  in  India,  one  of  the  financial \ninfrastructures identified and a high priority for the government. \n \nV.

The  investments  are classified  as  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment  and \ninvoluntary resettlement, and as category FI (treated as C) for indigenous peoples. The potential \nenvironment and social impacts of the proposed investments and associated risks have been \nassessed, as well as the banks\u2019 commitment to and capacity for environmental and social \nmanagement. The proceeds of ADB\u2019s funding will not be used by JFS or its successor, Jana \nSmall  Finance  Bank,  to  finance  projects  classified  as  having  category  A  impacts  on  the \nenvironment or involuntary settlement, or projects classified as having category A or B impacts \non indigenous peoples.

Its draft know-your-\ncustomer and anti-money laundering policy, which is subject to board approval, mitigates the risks \nof money laundering and terrorist financing.
