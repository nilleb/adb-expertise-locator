Developing a strong and dynamic private sector is vital for long-term economic growth, a \nnecessary precondition for poverty reduction. Private sector development (PSD) is among the \nkey objectives on the development agendas of many developing member countries (DMCs). \nDMCs implementing PSD initiatives carry out policies, programs, and projects in support of \nPSD, often assisted by international financial institutions (IFIs) and aid agencies to attract \nprivate sector investment. The results of these initiatives, however, are mixed. Private investors \ncontinue to perceive several DMCs as high risk, claiming that progress on the PSD agenda in \nterms of creating more conducive enabling conditions and a business environment in which the \nprivate sector can flourish falls below expectations.1 Faced with private sector reluctance to get \ninvolved or expand, DMCs understand the need to expedite the implementation of their PSD \nagendas and are becoming increasingly concerned about increasing the PSD impacts that their \nprojects may achieve.  \n \n2.  In  response  to  this  concern  and  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  DMCs  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  increase  transparency  in  terms  of  PSD  impact  orientation  of \nprojects at the outset, this regional technical assistance (TA) will develop, test, and implement a \nset of tools for facilitating greater focus on PSD on the project level and for assessing PSD \nimpacts of public sector operations and the development impacts of private sector operations in \nDMCs by using ADB projects as examples. Building DMC capacity to use these tools will enable \nthem to better plan for, use, and manage their PSD initiatives and will thus directly link into \nfuture country strategies and programs.2 This is in line with ADB\u2019s PSD strategy3 in which ADB \ncommits  to  institutionalizing  the  PSD/development  impacts  of  projects  to  enhance  their \ndevelopment effectiveness. The concept of this TA was approved by ADB\u2019s regional technical \nassistance  screening  committee  in  April  20034  and  was  endorsed  by  the  PSD  steering \ncommittee as a priority. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  PSD  cuts  across  a  large  number  of  factors,  sectors,  and  actors, and  results  often \nbecome  visible  only  in  the  medium  to  long  term.  To  show  successful  results  requires \ncomprehensive  coordination,  continuing  review  and  analysis,  and  perceptive  monitoring. \nEconomic and social indicators have been established, refined, evaluated, and reconfigured to \napproximate  the  status  of  PSD  in  a  country.  Most  of  these  indicators  are  on  the  macro-\neconomic or sector level and do not lend themselves to an assessment in advance of how \nspecific DMC projects can contribute to specific PSD/development impacts in that country.  \n \n4.  To monitor the contribution of projects in advancing the PSD agenda in DMCs, ADB\u2019s \nPSD strategy requires tracking ADB\u2019s portfolio for progress achieved in enhancing the PSD \nimpacts of public sector operations and development impacts of private sector operations in \nDMCs.5 It lists potential PSD impacts of projects in general terms, but does not provide a \nmethodology for scoring and assessing their impact. In the absence of such scoring and related \nperformance  indicators  and  benchmarks,  it  is  difficult  for  DMCs  and  ADB  to  compare  the \n                                                 \n1  See ADB\u2019s private sector assessments and ADB/WB investment climate studies for details. \n2  In this sense, this RETA is an extension of ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Supporting Country-Driven Private \nSector Development Strategies. Manila (RETA 6082). \n3  ADB. 2000. Private Sector Development Strategy. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 3 June 2003. \n5 From here onwards the PSD impacts of public sector operations and development impacts of private sector  \noperations will be replaced by PSD/development impacts. ", "2  \nPSD/development intensity of projects or to tell whether a project is designed to have high, \nmedium, or low PSD/development impact.6 This TA will develop a set of tools and build the \ncapacity to use them, which will allow DMCs and ADB to make a comparable assessment of \nPSD/development impacts in projects. \n \n5.  The tools to be developed under the TA have to be applicable to different project \nmodalities,  including  programs,  stand-alone  projects  (loans,  equity,  and  guarantees),  and \ntechnical  assistance.  They  must  achieve  a  balance  in  being  user-friendly  and  sufficiently \nstandardized to allow for comparison of operations over time and across DMCs, yet must be \nflexible and comprehensive enough to determine project-specific PSD/development impacts in a \nspecific country setup. In light of externalities and often only long-term effects, demonstrating \ncausality between project and PSD/development impact and establishing a serial correlation \nbetween  them  will  be  a  challenge.  Where  PSD/development  results  cannot  be  quantified, \nqualitative criteria will be required.  \n \n6.  The  tools  to  be  developed  will  be  based  on  existing  work  on  assessing \nPSD/development impacts to date7 and will include a PSD/development checklist to assist  in \nfocusing on PSD/development impact during project preparation, a set of PSD criteria that will \nhelp determine whether a project covers PSD, a PSD/development scorecard that represents \ndesirable PSD/development impacts and establishes the causal link between a project and \nrelated  PSD/development  impacts,  and  PSD/development  performance  indicators  and \nbenchmarks that allow for measuring and analyzing concrete PSD/development impacts in \nadvance as well as later on. The PSD/development scorecard and performance indicators and \nbenchmarks will be both analytical and strategic tools and will direct and align future project \ndevelopment efforts by communicating strategic objectives.  \n \n7.  An  important  factor  for  the  strategic  meaningfulness  of  the  PSD  scorecard  and \nperformance indicators and benchmarks is the identification of desirable PSD/development \nimpacts in a given country. ADB has been carrying out in many of its DMCs private sector \nassessments (PSAs) that provide information on the status of PSD for determining desirable \nPSD impacts. Based on this information and on the sector road maps developed by ADB as \ninputs  for  country  strategy  programs  (CSPs),  impacts  to  be  achieved  and  performance \nbenchmarks can be developed. As a strategic instrument, the PSD/development scorecard will \nassign  a  priority  ranking  to  impacts  and  include  performance  targets  or  benchmarks  as \nindicators. A combination of before and after assessment on this basis can provide DMCs with \nconcrete lessons learned. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to assess PSD/development impacts of projects. The results of \nmeasurement can provide important lessons learned that may be applied in developing future \nprojects. The goal of the TA is to enhance the capacity of DMCs and ADB to identify and \nmeasure the qualitative and quantitative aspects of PSD/development impacts in projects, thus \nmaking them more transparent.  \n                                                 \n6 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is assessing project impact in terms of transition from \ncommand to market economy.  \n7  For  example,  work  by  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  on  transition  impact,  and  by \nInternational Finance Corporation on additionality. ", "    3 \n \n9.  The activities of the TA aim to increase the focus on PSD/development impacts in \nprojects.  TA  outputs  will  include  PSD  criteria,  PSD  checklists,  PSD  scorecards,  and \nperformance  indicators  and  benchmarks.  The  TA  will  build  the  capacity  to  use  the  tools \ndeveloped and lessons learned by disseminating the findings of the study to DMCs and ADB \nstaff. Knowledge gained will be used to improve the design and implementation of ADB projects \nin DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will build on ADB\u2019s PSD strategy and its strategic thrusts, PSAs, sector road \nmaps, and CSPs and will consist of four activity clusters: (i) selection of pilot-test projects, (ii) \nresearch and analysis, (iii) development and testing of outputs, and (iv) capacity building and \ndissemination.  \n \n11.  The implementation of the TA will begin with activity cluster (i), with staff discussions in \nheadquarters, particularly in regional departments and Operations Evaluation Department, on a \nlong list of projects for the pilot test. Sectors to be covered include infrastructure (power and \nenergy, transport, and telecommunications), finance (banking and capital markets), small and \nmedium-size enterprises, trade, agriculture, natural resources, and social sectors (water and \nsanitation, education, health). Selected thematic projects in poverty reduction, economic growth, \ngovernance, human development, regional cooperation, and gender will be included. The pilot \ntest will focus on projects under preparation or in the early stages of implementation. Based on \na detailed review of project documents and background information, the sectors and themes \nmay be narrowed down and the long list reduced to a shortlist, with at least three projects in \neach of the selected sectors and thematic areas. Up to five DMCs, possibly one from each of \nADB\u2019s regions, will participate in the TA. The actual DMCs have not yet been identified but their \nselection will depend on the location of the short-listed projects and DMC interest in adopting \nPSD impact measures. Letters of no objection will be obtained before the initiation of the TA \nthere, once the selection process is finalized during implementation. \n \n12.  In preparing to develop the PSD/development scorecard and performance benchmarks, \nkey activities under activity cluster (ii) will include data collection, research and analysis of \nexisting  PSD/development  benchmarks  and  indicators;  detailed  analysis  of  gaps  in  linking \nPSD/development  impacts  to  projects;  PSD/development  scorecard  and  performance \nbenchmarks  or  indicator  proxies  of  other  IFIs  and  bilateral  funding  agencies;  review  and \nanalysis of PSD/development impacts in ADB\u2019s PSD strategy, PSAs, sector road maps, and \nCSPs; and research and analysis of PSD/development impacts in ADB projects.  \n \n13.  Activity cluster (iii) will include the development of a set of tools will help identify and \nevaluate specific PSD/development impacts in projects. Building on ADB\u2019s PSD strategy, the \ntools will include PSD criteria in ADB that provide an understanding of what is considered PSD \nand determine, before a project or after, whether it includes PSD aspects; PSD/development \nchecklists for project development to assist government officials and project team leaders in \nfocusing  on  PSD/development  impact;  PSD/development  scorecards  for  desired \nPSD/development impacts; and PSD/development performance benchmarks for measuring and \nanalyzing concrete PSD/development impacts in advance as well as later on. TA outputs will \ninclude  guidelines  for  using  the  tools  developed  and  for  setting  targets  or  benchmarking \nPSD/development performance. The TA outputs will be pilot-tested in the short-listed projects. A \ncrucial task under this activity cluster is to establish a broad consensus on the tools among ", "4  \nDMCs and within ADB. Following the refinement and finalization of the TA outputs, they will be \navailable for application to all ADB projects.  \n                                                                                                                                                      \n14.  Activity cluster (iv) consists of building capacity and consensus and dissemination. It \nentails national workshops and an interregional workshop to facilitate dialogue between DMCs \nand ADB staff as well as interregional exchange. DMCs from all regions will be invited to the \nworkshop. The outputs and findings of the TA will be presented in the form of a handbook. In \naddition, a CD ROM will be prepared for training purposes, and web content on the TA for \nADB\u2019s web site will be developed for wider dissemination. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Staff from the Governance and Regional \nCooperation  Division  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  will  be \nresponsible for all TA activities. The PSD committee will serve as the advisory group to the TA \nand will generate the project long list, facilitate the generation of the shortlist, and review and \ncomment on the consultants\u2019 outputs. TA activities will be closely coordinated with regional \ndepartments,  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department,  sector  and  thematic  committees, \nongoing ADB activities, as well as activities of other IFIs and aid agencies. \n \n17.  It is estimated that consulting services of 17 person-months (12 international and 5 \ndomestic)  will  be  required.  ADB  will  engage  individual  consultants  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. The international consultants will comprise two PSD specialists with extensive \nexpertise and experience in public and private sector projects, sequencing PSD, development \nimpacts in private sector operations, impact assessment, sector-wide approaches, creating \nconducive business environments, and managing business processes for measurable results. \nInternational consultants will be required to have extensive PSD and IFI project experience in \nAsia and the Pacific region. The domestic consultants will include one PSD specialist/research \nanalyst per participating DMC to assist the international team and facilitate local workshops. The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The TA is expected to start in April 2004 and to be implemented over 12 months, ending \nin April 2005. Implementation will include local and an interregional workshop for disseminating \nthe  pilot-test  results  and  study  findings,  facilitating  interregional  exchange,  and  providing \ncapacity building on the outputs developed. The consultants will submit an inception report 3 \nweeks after the team leader\u2019s input begins; brief monthly interim progress reports; a draft final \nreport, including the manual on the use of the tools after 5.5 months of team leader\u2019s inputs; a \ndraft report of the proceedings of the interregional workshop 1 week after the workshop; and a \nfinal report by the end of the TA period. \n \nIV.

International Consultants (12 person-months) \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will be implemented over a period of 12 months. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will recruit two international private sector development (PSD) \nspecialists as consultants, with one of them acting as team leader. The consultants will work \nclosely together and provide 12 person-months of consulting services. They will have generally \nsimilar terms of reference, as described in the following paragraphs, with the team leader taking \non the additional tasks of preparing a work program and having accountability of leadership, \nliaison with ADB, and reporting. \n \n2.  The  consultants  should  have  an  advanced  degree  in  economics,  business \nadministration,  law,  or  a  related  discipline;  and  proven  knowledge  and  extensive  work \nexperience in PSD, ideally on project development and on project evaluation, and in public and \nin private sector projects. They should have worked extensively with or within international \nfinancial  institutions  (IFIs).  They  will  be  experts  on  issues  such  as  sequencing  of  PSD; \ndevelopment  impacts  in  private  sector  operations;  PSD  impact  assessment;  sectorwide \napproaches; creating conducive business environments; and managing business processes for \nmeasurable  outputs,  outcomes,  and  impacts.  The  consultants  should  have  extensive \nexperience in Asia and the Pacific region and expertise in different sectors so that they can \ncomplement each other.  \n  \n3.  The consulting tasks will include, but will not be limited, to four general areas. \n1.  Selection of Pilot-Test Projects \n4.  The specific tasks of the consultants include to: \n(i)  Carry out a detailed review of project documents and other available \nbackground information for projects on the long list.  \n \n(ii)  Work  with  sector  and  thematic  committees,  ADB  staff  in  regional \ndepartments, Operations Evaluation Department, and the PSD committee \nin  identifying  selection  criteria  for  short  listing  and  assist  in  selecting \nprojects and developing member countries (DMCs) for the shortlist. \n \n2.  Data Collection, Research and Analysis  \n5.  The consultants\u2019 tasks in this area follow: \n \n(i)  Conduct a desk review of PSD-related policies; strategies; assessments; \nframeworks; plans; sector road maps; country strategy programs/updates; \nand other relevant documents of governments, ADB, other IFIs or aid \nagencies for the participating DMCs; and the sectors and themes covered \nby the project shortlist. Analyze PSD objectives, outputs, outcomes, and \nimpacts.  \n \n(ii)  Based  on  the  analysis  in  (i),  review,  compare,  and  analyze  PSD \nobjectives,  outputs,  outcomes,  and  impacts  of  the  projects  on  the \nshortlist. ", "  Appendix 3  9 \n \n(iii)  Research  and  analyze  existing  PSD  performance  benchmarks  and \nindicators, provide a detailed analysis of the gap in linking PSD impacts of \nprojects  to  them,  and  identify  how  this  analysis  can  be  used  for \ndeveloping the outputs for the TA. \n \n(iv)  Research and analyze approaches and methodologies to identify and \nassess PSD impacts of other IFIs and aid agencies for good practices \nand lessons learned and how these lessons can be used for developing \nthe outputs for this TA. \n \n(v)  Refine  existing  definitions  of  PSD,  development  impact,  outputs, \noutcomes,  and  impacts  for  the  purposes  of  the  TA  and  compile  the \nfindings of the research and analysis. \n \n3.  Development and Pilot-Testing of Outputs  \n6.  Consultants\u2019 tasks included in this area follow: \n \n(i)  Building on the research and analysis above, develop a set of tools that \nallows  identification,  assessment,  and  optimization  of  specific \nPSD/development impacts before and after projects.
