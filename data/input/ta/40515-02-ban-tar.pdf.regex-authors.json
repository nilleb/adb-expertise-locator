INTRODUCTION \n1.   During the 2010 country programming mission, the Government of Bangladesh asked \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nto the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) to further advance its commitment to \ngender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in rural infrastructure initiatives. More specifically, \nthe TA will improve the capacity of the LGED to implement its gender equity action plan by \ndeveloping a more standardized approach to promote women\u2019s participation in and benefit from \nrural infrastructure development. The TA is consistent with the strategic priorities identified in \nthe  country  strategy  and  program,  2006\u20132010.1 ADB  and  the  government  reached  an \nagreement  on  the  project\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services.2 The TA design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  LGED\u2019s mission is to develop and manage rural infrastructure to increase farm and non-\nfarm production, create jobs, improve socioeconomic conditions, promote local governance, and \nact as an agent of change at the local level. Its implementation approach for rural infrastructure \nprojects  underscores  community  participation,  local  governance,  and  creating  community \nemployment and income benefits. This includes innovative elements that aim to foster women\u2019s \nparticipation in both project and local governance activities. Innovations include setting targets \nfor women\u2019s employment in construction, requiring equal pay for women for work of equal value, \nand promoting women-friendly working conditions. Where infrastructure initiatives have included \nupgrading of rural markets, these have included shops for women\u2019s businesses in women\u2019s \nmarket sections and reserved space on market platforms for women traders. There have also \nbeen initiatives to promote more effective participation in local decision making by women \nelected to reserved seats.  \n \n3.  LGED implements a large number of rural infrastructure projects. In June 2010, for \nexample, it had 53 rural infrastructure projects. Most of these projects are financed by the \ngovernment, but some are supported by development partners. LGED\u2019s rural infrastructure and \nwater management projects have been innovative in their approach to addressing governance \nissues  and  to  increasing  the  participation  of  women  in  local  councils  and  community \norganizations. But further improvement in the capacity of local government organizations and \nthe involvement of women in decision making is needed. LGED needs a standardized approach \nto foster women\u2019s participation in and benefit from the rural infrastructure program. It also needs \nto  pilot  additional  measures  for  improving  engagement  of  women  in  development  and \nmanagement of rural infrastructure.  \n \n4.  LGED has incorporated innovative elements into a number of recently completed and \ncurrent infrastructure projects that encourage women\u2019s participation in local governance and \nbenefit from improvements in rural infrastructure. However, there is no consolidated source of \ninformation  on  the  extent  to  which  LGED  rural  infrastructure  projects  are  incorporating \ninnovations that have been successful in previous projects, nor is there a consolidated source of \nguidance for future projects. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program: Bangladesh, 2006\u20132010. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2010.   \n \n ", "2   \n \n5.  To  strengthen  its  role  in fostering  the  participation  of  women  in  rural  infrastructure \ndevelopment, LGED needs to (i) develop an agreed set of elements of women\u2019s participation in \nthe decision making and planning of local governments on rural infrastructure, and (ii) pilot a \nperformance-based approach to women\u2019s participation in local governments.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced women\u2019s participation in local governance and \nthe  local  economy.  The  outcome  will  be  better  knowledge,  tools,  and  gender-related \nperformance criteria used by LGED. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  This TA aims to consolidate and build on the innovations achieved by LGED through its \nrural infrastructure projects. The TA will also explore the potential to apply LGED\u2019s experience \nwith  performance-based  approaches  to  local  government  practices  related  to  women\u2019s \nparticipation at the Union Parishad (local government institution) level.   \n \n8.  The TA will consist of the following two outputs: \n \n9.  Output  1:  Improved  LGED  capacity  to  engage  women  in  rural  infrastructure \ninitiatives. The TA will review innovations that have been undertaken to determine the extent to \nwhich they have been incorporated across rural infrastructure projects and to consider which \napproaches  to  implementation  have  been more  effective. The review  will  identify  a  set of \nminimum elements to be included in rural infrastructure projects (including those financed by the \ngovernment and supported by development partners) to enhance women\u2019s participation and \nbenefit, in order to create a more standardized approach. This component will result in better \ntools and initiatives in the design of LGED\u2019s rural infrastructure projects for a more consistent \napproach to women\u2019s participation and benefit.   \n \n10.  This learning- and capacity-development component provides an opportunity to draw on \nLGED  experience  in  a  more  structured  way.  This  component  will  be  pursued,  in  close \ncollaboration with LGED, to ensure that the focus is realistic and practical and that there is \nownership of the outputs. Three elements of this collaboration that will be particularly important \nare: \n \n(i)  collaboration with a subcommittee of the LGED Gender Forum to gain their guidance \nand support for this component and to promote the practicality and legitimacy of the \noutputs; \n(ii)  liaison with the LGED monitoring unit, which has an important role in tracking LGED \nproject performance, including in relation to gender equity; and  \n(iii)  workshop with LGED rural infrastructure project directors to discuss and refine the \nproposed list of minimum elements on women\u2019s participation and benefit and to \nmake recommendations to the Gender Forum so that it can finalize an agreed set of \nminimum elements. \n \n ", "  3 \n11.  Output  2:  Performance-based  approach  to  improve  women\u2019s  participation  in \nUnion Parishad structures and processes. This component will adapt an approach used in \nLGED urban infrastructure projects supported by ADB that uses a set of agreed performance \nindicators to give access to infrastructure investments. The performance criteria in this case will \nfocus specifically on women\u2019s participation in Union Parishad structures and processes. The \nperformance criteria used in the pilot will be finalized through consultations with participating \nunions to ensure their ownership and commitment. The provisions of the Local Government \n(Union Parishad) Act, 2009 that are relevant to women\u2019s participation will also be considered, so \nthat the pilot can contribute to implementation of this act.  \n \n12.  Twenty Union Parishads will have access to funds for infrastructure development, if they \nmeet  the  performance  standards  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  local  governments.  For  this \npurpose, $1 million has been set aside in the Sustainable Rural Infrastructure Improvement \nProject (SRIIP)3 to which this TA is related. The Union Parishads in the pilot that meet the \nagreed  performance  standards  will  receive  funds  of  up  to  $45,000  each  for  infrastructure \nactivities, such as upgrading village roads, building bridges or culverts, upgrading rural market \nstructures, and installing solar panels to provide lighting for rural markets. The Union Parishads \nwill manage the infrastructure investment with technical support from LGED.  \n13.  Capacity-building support will be provided to participating Union Parishads. The outcome \nof this approach will be tracked and assessed as a pilot for possible follow-up in future LGED \ninfrastructure projects. Results will also be shared with other development partners working with \nlocal governments, in particular the World Bank, in light of the Local Governance Support \nProgram, which is being implemented nationwide and also incorporates performance standards. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $575,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. \nThe Government of Bangladesh will cover the remaining $75,000 equivalent by providing office \nspace, counterpart staff, and communication support. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 4 years, and could start implementation on 1 June \n2011, before the loan consultants are in place. ADB will recruit individual consultants for the TA \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (May 2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.   As  agreed  by  LGED,  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency,  while  LGED  will  be  the \nimplementing agency, with support from the LGED Gender Forum. The LGED Gender Forum \nwill support and guide the implementation of component 1. As the Gender Forum is a large \ngroup, which includes senior management of LGED and project directors from all sections, the \nSRIIP  project  director  and  ADB  will  consult  with  the  LGED  chief  engineer  and  identify  a \nsubcommittee. The subcommittee will consist of a representative of LGED senior management \n(as chair), the SRIIP project director (as coordinator), 3\u20134 other project directors with rural \n                                                \n3 ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for Sustainable Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project. Manila. \n ", "4   \ninfrastructure projects, the LGED implementation monitoring unit, and a representative of ADB \nas an invitee. \n \n17.  ADB will recruit national consultants and administrative staff in consultation with LGED. \nRequired consultants include a team leader (42 person-months, 36 full-time and then 6 months \nintermittent), an analyst for component 1 (full-time for 8 months), a field supervisor (full-time for \n48  months),  four  field  workers  (48  months  each).  An  office  manager-cum-accountant  (48 \nperson-months) and an office support worker (48 person-months) are also required.   \n \n18.  The team leader will manage the consultants and administrative staff and be responsible \nfor the implementation and outputs of both components of the TA. The team leader will report to \nboth ADB and the SRIIP project director on the achievement of milestones and implementation \nprogress. \n \n19.  The areas in which the pilot will be implemented should be reasonably accessible to \nLGED\u2019s subproject offices to facilitate supervision and monitoring. The pilot unions should be \nidentified in clusters to maximize the resources available for capacity-building support. The \nparticipating unions should provide a reasonable basis on which to judge whether the approach \nmerits wider replication, and should therefore include a range of conditions. Unions should have \nequitable access to assistance. The pilot should thus exclude unions that have previously \nreceived  support  through  other  programs  for  capacity  development  related  to  women\u2019s \nparticipation. \n20.  An initial step for each component will be the formulation of an implementation plan. For \ncomponent 1, the implementation plan will be formulated within the first month in consultation \nwith the LGED Gender Forum Sub-Committee. For component 2, the implementation plan will \nbe based on several steps taken in the first phase of the component and be finalized in \nconsultation with the SRIIP project director and ADB before the end of the sixth month. A work \nplan for the first 6 months, showing the steps toward this point, will be prepared in the first \nmonth. \n \n21.  TA progress will be monitored by ADB and the SRIIP project director through consultant \nreports, periodic consultation, and review missions. The administrative reports (progress reports \nand work plans) are to be submitted on the agreed schedule (with technical reports attached). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION   \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Bangladesh to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nSupport to Local Government Engineering Department in Institutionalizing Women\u2019s Benefits \nfrom Rural Infrastructure Initiatives, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Reporting \nIndicators with Baselines  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact       \nEnhanced women\u2019s  Elected women in partner  Feedback from  Assumption \nparticipation in local  Union Parishads are equal  Union Parishad  Results and \ngovernance and the  participants in council  members (W/M)  findings from this \nlocal economy   decisions on infrastructure     TA will be \n  LGED monitoring  incorporated into \nLGED construction  unit  LGED processes \ncontractors consistently pay   \nequal wages to women and  Risk \nmen \nUnstable \nsociopolitical \nenvironment \n \nOutcome       \n Better knowledge,  Use of tools developed by  Feedback from  Assumption \ntools, and gender- LGED in project planning   LGED project  Continued \nrelated performance    directors  commitment of \ncriteria used by LGED  Pilot Union Parishads     LGED senior \nconsistently meet  Project baseline v.  management to \nperformance criteria  final assessment  the LGED \nagainst  Gender Equity \nperformance criteria  Strategy \n \nRisk \nCapacity \nconstraint of \nLGED not \naddressed \n \nOutputs       \n1.
