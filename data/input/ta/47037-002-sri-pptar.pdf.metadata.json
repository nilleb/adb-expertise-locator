Justification \n1  The  Sri  Lanka  government\u2019s  development  framework1  envisions  sustainable \ndevelopment of energy resources, enabling access to and use of energy services by the entire \npopulation, and reliable delivery of such services at a competitive price. To achieve the goal of \nmeeting the growing demand for electricity at sufficiently low cost and acceptable reliability to \nwiden access to growth opportunities and attain sustainability in the long term, the government \nplans to increase supply capacity of the system including through raising share of renewable \nenergy sources (e.g., hydro, wind, etc.), reducing total technical and commercial losses of the \ntransmission and distribution networks, and undertaking energy efficiency and conservation \nmeasures.  To  address  investment  needs  in  support  of  these  plans,  a  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) is needed to prepare a relevant investment program for consideration \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other financiers. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table A4.1.  \n \nTable A4.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \nConducting  project  technical,  April 2014  Inception Report  September 2013 \neconomic,  financial,  Interim Report  December 2013 \ngovernance, resettlement and  Draft Final Report  March 2014 \nenvironmental due diligence   Final Report  April 2014 \n       \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n \n3  The PPTA will also support an implementing agency in ensuring project readiness. In \naddition to a detailed engineering design and preparation of relevant bidding documents for the \nproposed hydropower plant being undertaken by a separate consulting firm,2 PPTA consultants \nwill assist the implementing agency in finalizing detailed design and preparation of procurement \npackaging and bidding documents for transmission and medium voltage sub-projects to be \nfinanced under the first tranche of the investment program as part of advance contracting \nactivities.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n4  The ADB will provide US$700,000 equivalent in grant financing from ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-Others).  The  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  will  provide  its \n                                                \n1 Government of Sri Lanka. 2006. Mahinda Chintana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka.

Consulting Services \n5  A consulting firm will be recruited for the TA project with total positions and person-\nmonths as indicated in Table A4.3. Taking into consideration the complexity of the investment \nprogram, the firm will be recruited using quality and cost based selection methodology with an \n90:10 technical-cost weighting based on simplified technical proposal. The consulting firm will \nconduct technical, economic, financial, and governance due diligence, prepare project cost \nestimates,  procurement  plan  and  implementation  schedule.
