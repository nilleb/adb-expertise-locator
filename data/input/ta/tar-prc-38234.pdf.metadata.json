The  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  reducing \npoverty, cutting the number of people living in absolute poverty1 from roughly 250 million in 1978 \nto an estimated 26.1 million in 2004. However, despite the Government\u2019s expanding efforts, \npersistent challenges remain and new ones have emerged. These include widening economic \ninequity, and a deceleration in poverty reduction.2 In view of experience in other countries, the \nGovernment recognizes the potential of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) as a partner in \nstate-supported  poverty  alleviation  (PA)  efforts.  The  Government  has  requested  technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to tap this potential. \n   \n2.  A concept paper for TA on NGO participation in village-level PA planning was included in \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program update 2005\u20132007 for the PRC. While the analysis and \npolicy recommendations generated by the TA will extend to the national level, Jiangxi Province \nwas  selected  to  host  the  pilot  test.  Jiangxi  has  (i)  strong  support  and  capacity  for  policy \nexperimentation by the Jiangxi Province Poverty Alleviation and Development Office (PADO) \nand other key bureaus; (ii) persistent pockets of poverty, despite provincial economic growth; \nand (iii) scope for links to complementary initiatives.3 Following talks with the State Council \nLeading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development (LGOP), the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF), China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation (CFPA), leading scholars, and international \norganizations, ADB clarified the context and priorities for its support during site visits and \ndiscussions in Jiangxi (8\u201312 November 2004). Agreements on the TA\u2019s goal, objective, scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost  and  financing  arrangements,  and  consultant  terms  of \nreference were finalized during follow-up dialogue. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  State-funded direct PA interventions in the PRC have consisted principally of budgetary \ngrants for local PA projects, and subsidized loans for poor households and communities.5  The \nlatter have involved some variation in models and actors at the periphery of government, namely \nthe Agricultural Bank of China and rural credit cooperatives. However, state-funded PA projects \nrely almost solely on local government planning, administration, implementation, and monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E). Meanwhile, evidence suggests that the efficacy of growing resources \ndevoted to PA projects (and also subsidized lending) is declining.6  This reflects, in part, the \nshifting nature of poverty in the PRC. Better targeted, innovative, and new approaches are \nneeded  to  simultaneously  address  (i)  persistent  absolute  poverty,  which  increasingly  is \nconcentrated in remote communities and hard-to-reach groups, such as the elderly and disabled; \nand (ii) the vulnerability of a much larger low-income population7 living at the brink of poverty.   \n \n4.  In light of this, and building on research and policy dialogue supported by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners, the Government has moved to adopt multidimensional definitions of \npoverty and participatory, village-level PA planning. However, gaps remain in implementation \n                                                 \n1  This figure refers to the official annual per capita income line of CNY627. \n2  Recorded poverty incidence rose marginally between 2002 and 2003, before an apparent drop in 2004. \n3 These include experimentation in streamlining funding from provincial to county governments, and a Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) project on participatory poverty reduction monitoring.   \n4 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 2 September 2004.   \n5   In 2003, the central Government funded nearly CNY12.0 billion in grants to PA projects and more than CNY18.0 \nbillion in subsidized loans. In practice, the latter often are directed to lower-risk productive projects.   \n6  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Policy Study on Poverty Reduction Strategy: \nTrends, Challenges, and Future Directions.  Manila.  The final report calls for greater NGO involvement in PA work.    \n7   In 2002, 58.3 million people were living on per capita income above the austere official poverty line of CNY627, but \nbelow the low-income threshold of CNY869 (roughly equivalent to the international $1 per day standard).   ", "2  \nand efficacy. The Government recognizes that PA efforts also are undercut by institutional \nissues,  such  as  (i)  poor  targeting  of  funds;  (ii)  lack  of  transparency  and,  in  some  cases, \nmisallocation of funds; and (iii) weak capacities and/or incentives to adopt new approaches. \nLGOP sees NGO participation in areas such as project design, management, and/or M&E as \nkey to addressing systemic flaws. However, under current laws,8 only better-resourced NGOs \ncan be engaged; and they are restricted to specific areas, such as limited microcredit. Thus, the \nTA responds to the Government\u2019s need for a breakthrough in project-based PA by designing and \ndemonstrating modalities for NGO-government partnership, and proposing supportive reforms.9 \nIt also builds on and complements ADB TA exploring new models for rural microfinance10 and \nalternative rural livelihoods.11 Finally, the TA\u2019s M&E component will link to related GTZ work in \nJiangxi, and to ADB-World Bank dialogue on assessing poverty in the PRC.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  To promote rural poverty reduction, with NGOs mainstreamed within more effective, \nefficient, and well-targeted PA programs throughout the PRC, the TA\u2019s objective is formulating \nand demonstrating replicable models and mechanisms for NGO participation in government-\nfunded village-level PA efforts. More specifically, the TA will formulate, and build consensus \nbehind, a comprehensive framework for mainstreaming NGOs into national PA efforts. Four \nmajor groups of outputs will contribute to this objective: \n(i)  Context analysis, mechanism design, and framework formulation. Consensus \nwill be reached on a comprehensive framework for NGO-government partnerships \nin reducing poverty, incorporating demonstrated models and mechanisms, and \nconcrete recommendations for institutional and policy reform; \n(ii)  Capacity building for NGO-government partnership. Key capacities will be built \namong local officials for cooperation with NGOs in village PA work; a framework for \ncapacity building of local NGOs will be designed, and a program initiated; and \nguidelines and core materials will be disseminated to support post-TA replication; \n(iii)  Pilot test support and implementation. NGO capacities for participating in PA \nefforts will be built, and a successful pilot test completed, with new mechanisms \nproven viable in 18 pilot and four hybrid model villages by the end of the TA; and \n(iv)  External M&E. Objective and externally credible assessment will be completed on \nthe efficacy and impact of NGO-implemented projects, including quantitative and \nqualitative dimensions, as well as comparisons to government-implemented PA \nprojects in small control and hybrid samples of villages.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  Appendix 2 details the four components outlined in paras. 7\u201313.   \n \n7.  Component  1. A rapid assessment will cover parallel macro-level and local profile \nstudies, identifying key issues (e.g., institutional and capacity-related barriers) that could affect \nthe TA. It will include a broad review of research and relevant initiatives, plus dialogue with \nnational and local government agencies, NGOs, and other domestic and international entities.  \n                                                 \n8  Restrictions include mandatory registration with government sponsorship, and prohibition of the use of budgetary \nPA funds for staffing and overhead costs. \n9  This is consistent with the emphasis on building NGO capacity and strengthening government-NGO cooperation in \nADB. 2003.

The project foresees some NGO involvement in providing microcredit.   \n ", "  3\nThe findings will inform design refinements for the two-phase pilot test, which will be finalized \nafter the technical report review workshop. The pilot test will divide selected poor villages12 into \nthree representative sub-samples to allow comparison of three models for PA projects by  \n(i)  conventional government channels, in four control sample villages;  \n(ii)  NGOs, planning and conducting PA work in 18 pilot villages (six in Phase 1)\u2014\ntentatively, one village per pilot county will be set aside for a sub-pilot, wherein \nability to provide microfinance13 will be a criterion for NGO selection; and \n(iii)  government, with NGOs contracted to support project design and implementation \nby conducting periodic participatory assessments, in four hybrid model villages.    \n \n8.  The technical report also will propose specific mechanisms and procedures for the pilot \ntest, including solicitation and selection of NGO proposals, transparent fund flows, and reporting. \nLater in the TA, this component will focus on the formulation of policy and institutional reforms, \nwith major forums to review interim and final report findings and to build consensus.   \n \n9.  Component 2.  Building on the findings of the local profile study, a detailed assessment \nof capacity gaps in local governments and NGOs (including CFPA) vis-\u00e0-vis the roles foreseen \nfor them under the pilot test will guide the design of multiphase and multimode capacity building \nprograms. Complementary programs will target (i) local officials, giving phased support before \nand during the pilot test; and (ii) local NGOs, with program co-design, initiation, and turnover to \nCFPA (component 3) after training of trainers (TOT). Two international study visits, and applied \nfollow-up activities, tentatively will cover modalities for involving NGOs in local PA efforts; and \nmacro-level policy and institutions.14 Finally, to facilitate post-TA replication of proven elements \nin Jiangxi and other provinces, this component will include curriculum design, and production \nand dissemination of core resource materials to support future capacity building programs. \nMaterials on supporting local NGOs in PA work will be provided to potential apex NGOs, while \nmaterials on coordinating NGO participation in PA efforts will be given to provincial governments. \n \n10.  Component 3.  Following TOT and iterative co-design of core materials in component 2, \nCFPA will provide multistage capacity building and informal support to NGOs under the pilot test. \nCFPA also will administer pilot test processes, supervised by Jiangxi PADO (para. 16).   \n \n11.  Component 4. For implementing policy research embedded in the pilot test design, \nexternal M&E will provide cross-sectional and time-series comparisons of pilot, control, and \nhybrid sample villages. Shared data from a common, expanded baseline study will ensure \nexternal M&E is consistent with, and complements, the verification of inputs and physical outputs \nby local governments and CFPA during the pilot test. Findings of biannual M&E circuits and \ndetailed  case  studies  will  be  reviewed  at  workshops,  including  mid-stage  and  final  pilot \nassessment workshops in Jiangxi. These findings will feed into national policy dialogue under \ncomponent 1. Late in implementation, the TA will support a final capacity building and skill \ntransfer program for PADO, CFPA, and other relevant stakeholders on maintaining a simplified \nM&E  system  to  capture  key  longer-term  impacts  in  pilot  villages.  This  will  include  a  self-\ncontained toolkit of print and multimedia tools, which will be incorporated into core resource \nmaterials disseminated in component 2. The TA also will support the formulation of a framework \nfor M&E appropriate to NGO participation in PA activities, with clear articulation of roles across \nactors, and guidelines to establish a minimalist management information system. The aim of \n                                                 \n12 Subject to adjustments that ADB and LGOP agree upon, by phase 2, the pilot test will cover 26 poor villages in \nthree nationally-designated key working counties for poverty alleviation and development in Jiangxi. \n13 This might include ability to access subsidized loans.   \n14 For the two visits, the TA will fund five officials from LGOP, PADO, CFPA, and Jiangxi bureaus critical to the pilot \ntest; and 3\u20134 central Government decision makers. LGOP and PADO may seek funds to expand participation.  ", "4  \nthese measures is to sustain tracking of the Jiangxi pilot after TA completion, and to ensure \npost-project replication of effective M&E approaches. \n   \n12.  As the TA\u2019s central deliverable, the final report (under component 1) will incorporate TA \nresearch (including international experience), quantitative and qualitative findings from M&E, and \nother lessons learned from the pilot test outcomes and processes (e.g., capacity building).  It \nalso will reflect the workshops and broader policy dialogue, consultation, and consensus building \namong  key  stakeholders  at  the  national  level  and  lower  administrative  levels  in  Jiangxi \nthroughout the TA. The report will document and disseminate to key policymakers proven \nmodalities for partnership with NGOs to enhance targeting, efficacy, and efficiency of public \nresources devoted to PA projects. Its main  annex will be a comprehensive framework for \nstrategy and reform, including concrete recommendations on key aspects, such as \n(i)  a clear articulation of roles of governments and NGOs at various levels, based on \ncomparative advantage; \n(ii)  resource mobilization and viable, sustainable modalities for PA program design, \ncoordination, implementation, and M&E (tracking from input delivery to impact);  \n(iii)  policy, finance, regulatory, and institutional reform to support post-TA replication \nand advance NGO-government partnership more broadly in PA efforts; and \n(iv)  capacity building programs to address priority human resource gaps. \n \n13.  To reinforce government ownership and ensure transparency, studies and information on \nNGO selection, fund flows, and other aspects of the pilot test will be disseminated widely, \nincluding via Internet, workshops involving multiple stakeholders, and informal consultations.     \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $2,100,000 equivalent, comprising $285,000 in foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $1,815,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested that ADB finance $1,000,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost \nand $715,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund \nwill finance the TA through a grant, which ADB will administer. CFPA will finance $100,000 \nequivalent, largely through staff time and allowances, travel (excluding a TA-financed portion), \nand  logistical  and  administration  costs.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $1,000,000, by providing counterpart staff and allowances, office \naccommodation (with basic supplies), venues for training and meetings, administrative support \nand certain local transport, and budgetary PA funds during the pilot test. Detailed cost estimates \nand the financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  April  2005  to  October  2007.  LGOP  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency. Reporting to LGOP, Jiangxi PADO will oversee day-to-day implementation, \nguiding the consultants and CFPA (paras. 16\u201317). Jiangxi PADO also will facilitate analysis, \nlocal policy dialogue, and pilot test implementation, including coordination across bureaus and \nlevels. Through Jiangxi PADO, as appropriate, LGOP will ensure (i) timely provision of agreed \ngovernment counterpart inputs; (ii) administration of a portion of TA funds;15 and (iii) cross-\nagency coordination, including facilitating access to government data, communication channels, \nand other information resources. Later, LGOP will spearhead advocacy and intra-government \nconsultation to promote post-TA replication of successfully piloted elements and broader reform. \n                                                 \n15 This includes procurement of equipment and initial supplies for a project office provided by Jiangxi PADO, certain \nworkshops, and other activities agreed by ADB, and resource persons for workshops and review of key reports.  \n ", "  5\nA central-level Policy Review Group16 will facilitate interagency coordination and review TA \nfindings at key junctures to help ensure accuracy and policy relevance. The group also will \npromote broad support by key agencies for the actualization of final recommendations on policy, \nstrategy, and reforms. Jiangxi PADO will chair the Provincial Coordination Group17 to support \npilot test preparation and implementation, and to facilitate policy dialogue and sharing of lessons.   \n \n16.  LGOP has appointed CFPA to oversee implementation of the pilot test under component \n3. CFPA\u2019s qualifications include a strong track record of PA work in Jiangxi and a relationship \nwith Jiangxi PADO. It also has proven capacity in direct project implementation (ranging from \nmicrofinance to education and health); and capacity building for, and oversight of, local NGOs in \nPA work. CFPA will report to LGOP and act as liaison for ADB, as needed. Under support and \nsupervision from central CFPA, the Jiangxi chapter of CFPA will act as the Implementing Agency \nfor  component  3,  and  will  report  jointly  to  PADO.  It  will  have  principal  responsibility  for \nimplementing a capacity building program for NGOs, co-designed and jointly initiated with the \nconsultant firm (para. 17). The Jiangxi chapter of CFPA also will administer funds for village PA \nprojects under the pilot test, including budgetary PA funds in pilot villages and ADB counterpart \nfunds for NGO overhead costs in pilot and hybrid villages, fully and transparently channeled to \nselected NGOs. PADO will authorize CFPA to coordinate competitive proposal submissions by \neligible NGOs, and other procedures formulated under component 1 that LGOP and ADB agree \nto. After CFPA compiles and reviews them, PADO will select NGOs for ADB\u2019s endorsement on a \nno objection basis, based on summary documents validating the process and selection criteria. \nTo facilitate implementation, ADB will establish an advance payment facility for use by LGOP, \nJiangxi PADO, and Jiangxi CFPA, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Disbursement of \nTechnical Assistance Grants and terms noted in letters establishing the facility.  \n \n17.  In accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development \nBank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants, ADB will recruit individual consultants and two sub-teams of consultants \nthrough a firm. The terms of reference (Appendix 4) outlines tasks and reporting requirements.  \nFive individual consultants\u2014one international (for 2.5 person-months) and four domestic (18 \nperson-months)\u2014will take lead responsibility for component 1, including analysis, policy studies, \nand pilot test design. Using the biodata technical proposal format and quality and cost-based \nselection, ADB will engage a consultant firm to mobilize two sub-teams.18 Component 2 will \nrequire one international consultant (2.5 person-months) and three domestic consultants (14 \nperson-months)  to  provide  capacity  building  for  local  governments.  Consultants  under \ncomponent 2 also will collaborate with (and provide TOT for) CFPA to design and launch \ncapacity building for NGOs, as an input to component 3. One international consultant (1.5 \nperson-months) and three domestic consultants (8 person-months) will conduct external M&E \nand final skill transfer for component 4.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty \nReduction  Cooperation  Fund  for  Nongovernment  Organization-Government  Partnerships  in \nVillage-Level Poverty Alleviation, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n16 Chaired by LGOP, the group tentatively will consist of representatives of MOF (providing the vice chair), Ministry of \nCivil Affairs (MOCA), National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). \n17 This tentatively will include representatives of (i) provincial bureaus under MOF, MOCA, NDRC, and MOA; (ii) \nJiangxi CFPA; and (iii) each pilot county government (four seats, including from PADO and the finance bureau). \n18 Sub-teams will operate independently after the baseline study, and will mobilize local resource persons as needed.

Context Analysis, Mechanism Design, and Framework Formulation \n1.  The group of individual consultants will take principal responsibility for implementing the \ncomponent. The group leader also will mobilize and coordinate additional resource persons as \nneeded to facilitate workshops, review of draft reports, and provide other focused expert inputs.  \nThe principal output will be a consensus on a comprehensive framework for nongovernment \norganization (NGO)-government partnerships in reducing poverty, incorporating demonstrated \nmodels and mechanisms as well as concrete recommendations for institutional and policy reform.   \n \n2.  Activity Area 1.1. As a foundation for design of the pilot test (particularly identifying \nissues  and  potential  obstacles),  the  consultants\u2019  rapid  assessment  report  will  document \nconclusions of the inception workshop (in Jiangxi) and the initial findings of two studies (to be \nfinalized in the interim report):  \n(i)  a macro-level study assessing \n(a)  relevant legislation, regulation, policies, and planning at the national level and \nwithin Jiangxi, with particular focus on implications for the potential role of \nNGOs1; \n(b)  institutional  aspects of government-administered poverty reduction efforts, \nand evaluation of efficacy and efficiency, including intra-agency coordination \nmechanisms, and indicative assessment of the capacities of governments to \nshift to facilitation and oversight of NGO-implemented programs;  \n(c)  status  of  NGO  involvement  in  poverty-related  areas  in  the  PRC,  and \ninstitutional and capacity-related issues;  \n(d)  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  systems,  mechanisms,  and  indicators \n(including  those  developed  by  international  agencies  active  in  this  area) \ncovering \ni.  government-administered programs, capturing investment and/or inputs, \nimplementation, and impacts; and \nii.  similar aspects of NGO-implemented, poverty-related activities; and \n(ii)  a local profile study, conducted in close dialogue with the China Foundation for \nPoverty Alleviation (CFPA), which \n(a)  characterizes poverty in Jiangxi (including underlying causes, manifestations, \nand existing programs to address it), starting with a focused study of the \nthree target counties, and incorporating findings into the selection of pilot, \ncontrol, and hybrid sample villages (main text, para. 10);  \n(b)  provides an inventory of local and external NGOs active in social protection \nand social development  at different levels within Jiangxi, assessing their \noverall status and capacities, and a gap analysis vis-\u00e0-vis competencies \nrequired to implement publicly funded poverty reduction programs;   \n(c)  assesses the preparedness of local governments to cooperate with NGOs in \nlocal poverty alleviation (PA) efforts, and identifies potential obstacles for the \npilot test.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA will focus principally, but not exclusively, on the role of government-recognized NGOs. The term NGO is \nused broadly to include registered NGOs, as well as all other nongovernment actors, such as academic institutions, \nother shiyedanwei (state-sponsored institutions), and private sector entities.   ", "12  Appendix 2 \n3.  The local profile study and follow-up work under component 2 will be critical, given the \nvarying capacity levels of NGOs likely to participate in the pilot test. In addition, cooperation with \nlocal governments has been largely ad hoc, without any funding transfers. \n \n4.  The rapid assessment will guide village selection for the pilot test. Based on interim \nfindings, two pilot townships will be selected within each of the three pilot counties by the end of \nMay 2005. Based on discussion of report findings by mid-June 2005, ADB and LGOP will select \nthe following from among representative poverty villages within each pilot township: \n(i)  one phase 1 pilot village (totaling six); \n(ii)  one control sample and/or hybrid model village (totaling four of each; component 3); \nand \n(iii)  two villages per pilot township (totaling 12) to receive PA funds as pilot villages \nduring phase 2.  \n \n5.  Activity Area 1.2. In view of international models and experience, and their relevance to \nthe local and national context, the consultants\u2019 technical report will provide a detailed draft \ndesign for the pilot test. The report also will be based on dialogue with the State Council Leading \nGroup Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development (LGOP), Jiangxi Poverty Alleviation and \nDevelopment Office (PADO), CFPA, and other key stakeholders.   \n \n6.  The pilot test will have two phases: \n(i)  Phase  1:  By  the end of 2005, Jiangxi  PADO will authorize the  simultaneous \nrelease of PA funds for six phase 1 pilot villages, and for control and hybrid sample \nvillages (four each), to allow clean comparisons across three models. The village \nPA projects will be implemented by  \n(a)  traditional government channels in the four control villages;  \n(b)  NGOs in six pilot villages, with CFPA providing administration of PADO funds \nand oversight; and \n(c)  government,  with  NGOs  contracted  to  carry  out  participatory  needs \nassessment  and  mid-project  consultation,  to  support  project  design  and \nimplementation in four hybrid model villages.    \n(ii)  Phase 2: Initial disbursement under phase 2 is estimated to start in August 2006, \nwhich  will  allow  findings  from  the  first  M&E  midyear  circuit  to  guide  critical \nadjustments  in  pilot  test  operating  mechanisms,  capacity  building,  and  other \napproaches prior to scaling up the pilot. Starting in August 2006, 18 pilot villages \nwill be active in the pilot.  Tentatively, three of these villages (one per pilot county) \nwill be set aside for a sub-pilot, wherein ability to provide microfinance2 will be a \ncriterion for NGO selection. PA projects in pilot, control, and hybrid villages will \ncontinue through September 2007 (near project end).    \n \n7.  Finalized after workshop review, the report will reflect the agreement with CFPA and \ngovernments at various levels on a clear delineation of roles and consistency of functions. It will \ninclude clear systems and mechanisms for  \n(i)  screening (including proposed criteria) and prequalifying candidate NGOs; \n(ii)  preparing proposals (including guidelines for NGO-community consultation), and \ntransparently reviewing applications;  \n(iii)  governing and accounting for flows of budgetary PA funds; \n                                                 \n2 This might include ability to access subsidized loans. In the longer term, NGO access to PA funds is expected to \nlower the barrier posed by collateral requirements. \n ", "  Appendix 2  13 \n(iv)  ensuring  appropriate  local  contribution  and  participation  (from  township \ngovernments to members of the community);  \n(v)  disseminating  information  to,  and  consulting  with,  stakeholders  throughout  the \nprocess; and  \n(vi)  internal tracking to account for resource inputs and physical outputs, including \n(a)  reporting requirements for selected NGOs and other actors, and \n(b)  verification roles for local governments and CFPA in verifying resource inputs \nand physical outputs.   \n \n8.  Consistent  with  the  pilot  test  research  design,  the  designs  for  internal  tracking  will \nemphasize consistency and complementarity. The external M&E consultant will collect more \nqualitative evidence. Internal tracking and external M&E collectively will aim to \n(i)  ensure effective fund use and realization of PA objectives during the pilot test, and \n(ii)  generate policy-relevant and externally credible evidence as the basis for the final \nreport (see para. 12 of main text).   \n \n9.  Activity  Area  1.3.  Building  on  preliminary  analysis  conducted  during  the  rapid \nassessment, the final findings of the macro-level and local profile studies will be incorporated \ninto the consultants\u2019 interim report on policy and institutional reforms. This interim report will be \nfinalized following review at the National Interim Forum on NGO-Government Partnerships in \nVillage-Level Poverty Alleviation.  The Forum will be chaired by LGOP and will comprise the key \npoint of the midterm review (MTR). \n \n10.  Activity Area 1.4. The LGOP-chaired International Forum on Strategies and Policy for \nNGO-Government Partnerships in Poverty Alleviation will review and reach agreement on the \nTA\u2019s report. To finalize the report, the TA will draw on research and international experience \n(especially on models and supportive reform), as well as lessons learned from the pilot test, \nincluding outcomes and processes. It also will incorporate the workshops and broader policy \ndialogue, consultation, and consensus building among key stakeholders at the national level and \nlower administrative levels within Jiangxi throughout the TA. The report will document and \ndisseminate to key policymakers proven models and mechanisms to enhance the targeting, \nefficacy, and efficiency of public resources for poverty reduction through NGO participation in \nvillage-level  poverty  reduction  planning  and  implementation.  A  major  annex  will  provide  a \ncomprehensive framework for strategy and reform, including concrete recommendations on key \naspects surrounding NGO participation in poverty reduction, such as \n(i)  a clear articulation of roles between governments and NGOs at various levels, \nbased on comparative advantage; \n(ii)  resource mobilization and viable, sustainable models and mechanisms for project \nand/or  program  design,  coordination,  implementation,  and  M&E,  including \nidentifying roles and key elements of comprehensive M&E approaches to capture \nthe performance of public funds allocated to PA (tracking from input delivery to \nultimate impact) under government- and NGO-implemented programs;  \n(iii)  policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms to support replication of successfully \npiloted approaches and, more broadly, to improve NGO-government partnerships \nin poverty reduction; and \n(iv)  capacity  building  programs  to  address  identified  priorities  related  to  human \nresource gaps. \n \nB.    Capacity Building for NGO-Government Partnership \n \n11.  Sub-team  1  of  the  firm-based  consultant  team  will  take  principal  responsibility  for \nimplementing the component. The team will mobilize  and coordinate local resource persons, as ", "14  Appendix 2 \nneeded, for training sessions. The principal outputs will be (i) development of key capacities \namong local governments for effective cooperation with NGOs in village PA work, (ii) design of a \nframework  for  capacity  building  for  local  NGOs  (and  initiation  of  the  program),  and  (iii) \ndissemination of guidelines and core resource materials to support post-TA replication of NGO \nand government capacity building. \n \n12.  Activity Area 2.1. Building on parts (b-c) of the local profile study, the firm will complete \nan in-depth assessment of capacities and gaps3 among \n(i)  provincial and local governments in target areas;  \n(ii)  NGOs active in relevant areas at different levels within Jiangxi; and \n(iii)  CFPA. \n \n13.  Activity Area 2.2. In close dialogue with CFPA, the sub-team will formulate a framework \nfor and jointly initiate with CFPA a capacity building program for NGOs, covering a spectrum of \ncompetencies needed for various stages and tasks under the pilot test: \n(i)  Design and agreement with CFPA on a framework for NGO capacity building and \ntraining of trainers (TOT) program for CFPA, which (following joint post-selection \ntraining) will take principal responsibility for capacity building and support to NGOs \nunder component 3; \n(ii)  Based on this framework, full development of the TOT program for review by \nLGOP, CFPA, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Draft TOT materials will \nact as the seed for a set of flexible core materials used in capacity building for \nNGOs; \n(iii)  Provision  of  TOT  to  CFPA,  with  outputs  including  a  work  plan  for  joint \nimplementation of the post-selection training for NGOs; and expanded materials;  \n(iv)  Co-implementation  (funded  under  the  consultancy  contract)  with  CFPA  of  this \ntraining  for  phase  1  NGOs  before  village  project  inception,  focusing  on  core \ncapacities for early-phase work (e.g., participatory needs assessment to sharpen \nproposed PA project design) and procedural requirements (e.g., accounting and \nreporting, transparency mechanisms, etc.);  \n(v)  Based on cooperation with CFPA during the post-selection training, refinement and \nextension  of  draft  materials  into  a  core  set  of  flexible  resource  materials  (in \nChinese);  and  guidelines  for  CFPA  implementation  of  subsequent  stages  of \ncapacity building under component 3. \n(vi)  Based on early M&E findings from component 4, joint review with CFPA of NGO \nefficacy and program adjustment, follow-up TOT, and core materials refinement. \n  \n14.  Activity Area 2.3. The sub-team\u2019s main focus will be designing and implementing a \nmultistage capacity building program for key government agencies at provincial, county, and \ntownship  levels.  The  program  will  focus  on  enabling  their  shift  from  PA  implementers  to \nfacilitators, with oversight of NGO-implemented efforts in selected target areas.4 Village leaders \nalso might be included, as deemed appropriate. For each phase, this will consist of \n(i)  organizing an orientation session (chaired by PADO) on the pilot test for relevant \ngovernment agencies; \n(ii)  pre-pilot  training  for  frontline  government  officials,  with  urgent  training  on \ncooperation with NGOs given priority; and \n                                                 \n3  This will identify and prioritize obstacles, principally gaps in existing capacities vis-\u00e0-vis competencies required by \neach actor to carry out roles foreseen under the draft design for the pilot test. \n4   Sub-programs will address different models adopted in pilot villages in different localities. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  15 \n(iii)  periodic capacity building for local governments, according to a program design \nand work plan to be agreed with PADO and ADB shortly after completion of the \nbaseline study (component 4).  \n \n15.  Activity Area 2.4. The consultants will propose to ADB and LGOP a program of two \nfocused international study visits (estimated 8\u201310 days each), tentatively covering \n(i)  local models for NGO involvement\u2014the TA will support visits by five persons (from \nLGOP, PADO, CFPA, and relevant Jiangxi bureaus) to a developing or middle-\nincome  Asian  country  with  innovative  models  and  mechanisms  for  NGO-\ngovernment cooperation in local PA efforts.  The program will feed into early \nimplementation of the pilot test; and \n(ii)  macro policy and institutions\u2014the TA will support visits by three to four key central \nGovernment  decision-makers  to  one  developing  and  one  relatively  developed \ncountry  with  established  regulations,  policies,  and  institutional  mechanisms  to \nsupport NGO involvement in addressing poverty and related social issues, to build \non and sharpen policy and institutional reform dialogue initiated by the interim \nreport and progress during the first half of the TA. \n \nGroup sizes may be expended slightly, pending LGOP and PADO recruitment of non-TA funding, \nbut should not exceed 15.  \n \n16.  Activity Area 2.5. The TA will support ready replication of successfully piloted elements \nthroughout Jiangxi and to other provinces after project completion, as well as curriculum design \nand the production and dissemination of core resource materials as the basis for future capacity \nbuilding programs for  \n(i)  leading  national  and  provincial-level  NGOs  on  core  capacity  building  for  local \nNGOs on participation in village-level PA; and \n(ii)  provincial  governments  on  coordinating  NGO  participation  in  PA,  including \nbudgeting, planning and guidance, supervision, and M&E for quality control, etc. \n \n17.  The consultant firm will work closely with CFPA in design, incorporating lessons learned \nfrom the project and international experience.  \n \nC.  Pilot Project Support and Implementation    \n18.  The  Jiangxi chapter of CFPA,  with oversight  from  Jiangxi PADO and support  from \nnational CFPA, will take principal responsibility for implementing the component. The TA will \nfund agreed non-staff expenditures directly related to implementation of this component. CFPA \nalso will cooperate actively with governments and the consultants, especially as indicated under \ncomponent 2. The principal output will be NGO capacities for participation in PA efforts built, and \na successful completed pilot test, with new mechanisms proven viable in 18 pilot and four hybrid \nmodel villages by the end of the project.   \n \n19.  Activity Area 3.1. Building on foundations built under component 2, the TA will provide \nmultistage capacity building and informal support to NGOs, including \n(i)  pre-selection orientation5 for potential NGO applicants for village-level PA projects, \nincluding overview of procedures and requirements under the pilot test;   \n                                                 \n5 Pending further review, this will be a mandatory certification course, though waivers might be allowed for firmly \nestablished NGOs able to demonstrate compliance with specified criteria ", "16  Appendix 2 \n(ii)  cooperation with consultant sub-team 1 in designing a framework for a systematic, \nmultimode capacity building program (activity area 2.2); and \n(iii)  capacity building initiatives and ongoing support for NGOs, conducted by CFPA \nfollowing completion of the initial TOT program and co-implementation with sub-\nteam 1 of the post-selection training seminar for NGOs (component 2). Based on \nthe agreed framework, these capacity building activities tentatively will consist of     \n(a)  first-round  mid-implementation  training  for  NGOs  involved  in  phase  1, \nfocused on implementation capacities \n(b)  at least one follow-up round during 2006 for NGOs active in phase 1, tailor fit \nbased  on  priority  needs  identified  at  the  MTR  and  Pilot  Mid-Stage \nAssessment; and \n(c)  repetition of each of the above for phase 2 NGOs. \n \nThe  program  might  be  adjusted  by  agreement  between  PADO  and  ADB  at  the  MTR, \nincorporating NGO feedback and broader efficacy assessment under component 4.  \n \n20.  Activity  Area  3.2.  CFPA  will  also  administer  the  pilot  test  on  NGO-government \npartnerships, spanning a range of agreed partnership models. Tasks will include \n(i)  coordinating solicitation of NGO proposals for village-level projects and subsequent \nstages  of  the  competition  process,  to  facilitate  final  selection  by  PADO  and \nendorsement by ADB, in accordance with mechanisms agreed with LGOP and \nADB (component 1); \n(ii)  CFPA\u2019s administering PADO funds earmarked for PA work under the pilot test, \ntaking responsibility for channeling budgetary PA funds to selected NGOs and \ncompiling accounts to comply with government requirements; CFPA also will assist \nPADO in disseminating summary information on fund flows on the Internet, each \nquarter or more frequently, to ensure transparency; and \n(iii)  reviewing progress and issues by a range of stakeholders at the PADO-chaired \nInterim Workshop on NGO-Government Partnerships in Village-Level PA, which \nwill initiate the MTR. \n \n21.  CFPA will provide ADB biannually (or more frequently as needed) progress reports and \nactivity proposals outlining expenses eligible for TA funding: (i) final printing and/or reproduction \nand dissemination of support materials to NGOs; (ii) workshops, including lodging and travel \nallowances for local government participants; and (iii) air transportation and accommodation for \nnational CFPA facilitators and non-CFPA resource persons (adding basic honoraria) to take part \nin seminars, in-field consultations, and other activities. These will be subject to prior ADB \nagreement, with APF replenishment subject to standard ADB liquidation procedures.   \n \n22.  Jiangxi PADO will provide one project office for use by CFPA and consultant missions \nunder  other  components.  Except  in  special  cases,  Jiangxi  PADO  will  secure  venues  for \nworkshops, training sessions, etc. at various levels. It also will liaise with local governments to \nensure cooperation and encourage communities\u2019 full participation. The TA will provide for the \nproject office a basic package of information and communication technology to support pilot \nadministration and oversight, with equipment transferred to LGOP ownership at project end.  \n \nD.  External M&E \n \n23.  Functioning independently after the baseline study to ensure objectivity, sub-team 2 \nunder the consultant firm will take principal responsibility for implementing the component. The \nteam also will mobilize, provide skill-augmentation training for, and supervise a local survey \n ", "  Appendix 2  17 \ncorps to support periodic data collection. The principal output will be an objective and externally \ncredible  assessment  of  the  efficacy  and  impact  of  NGO-implemented  projects,  including \nquantitative  and  qualitative  dimensions.  The  assessment  also  will  compare  the  NGO-\nimplemented projects with government-implemented PA projects in small control and hybrid \nsamples of villages.   \n \n24.  Activity Area 4.1. To actualize the research approach outlined in the TA paper, the sub-\nteam will develop and implement an external M&E system for the pilot test, yielding evidence \nfrom cross-sectional and time-series comparisons of representative pilot, control, and hybrid \nsample villages, as well as detailed case study investigations. This will complement verification \nof inputs and physical outputs by local governments and CFPA. The sub-team will   \n(i)  review and hold consultations on project-based M&E approaches developed by \nother national and externally supported projects (e.g., GTZ) to draw on existing \nbest practice;  \n(ii)  propose to ADB and LGOP a detailed plan for M&E under the pilot, capable of \ncapturing  qualitative  evidence  (including  through  detailed  case  studies)  and \nquantitative evidence (through creation of a panel data set). Emphasis will be on \nparsimony\u2014focusing on basic proxies and indicators for which accurate data can \nrealistically be obtained, but which are highly informative regarding processes and \nthe efficacy of NGO-implemented PA work; \n(iii)  draft a design for a common baseline study to provide pre-pilot information on pilot, \ncontrol,  and  hybrid  sample  villages,  incorporating  key  baseline  information \nrequested by PADO and CFPA to ensure external M&E is consistent with internal \ntracking of resource inputs and physical outputs;  \n(iv)  implement the common baseline study and an agreed program of periodic M&E of \nproject processes and outcomes; and \n(v)  present and review of findings of the preliminary report at the multi-stakeholder \ninterim workshop (component 3); and of the interim and draft final process and \nimpact  evaluation  reports  at  the  Jiangxi  mid-stage  and  final  pilot  assessment \nworkshops. The consultants will organize the latter, which PADO will chair, and it \nwill  feed  into  the  mid-TA  national  workshop  and  final  international  forum, \nrespectively.   \n \n25.  Activity Area 4.2. To sustain tracking of the Jiangxi pilot after TA completion, and to \nensure post-project replicability and retention of best practices learned in M&E under the TA, the \nsub-team (in close dialogue with PADO, CFPA, GTZ, etc.) will \n(i)  provide  a  final  capacity  building  program  for  PADO,  CFPA,  and  broader \nstakeholders  (as  appropriate)  to  ensure  skill  transfer  and  replicability  of  key \nelements of the TA\u2019s M&E strategy, aimed at a sustainable (if simplified) system to \ncapture longer-term measures of impact in pilot villages. This should include face-\nto-face  sessions  and  development  of  a  self-contained  toolkit  of  print  and \nmultimedia tools, to be incorporated into the resource materials in component 2; \nand \n(ii)  recommend  a  comprehensive  framework  for  M&E  under  expanded  NGO \ninvolvement in PA activities, with clear articulation of roles across actors, and \nguidelines for a minimalist and appropriate management information system. \n \n26.  Activity Area 4.3. The sub-team will draft a process and impact evaluation report for \nreview by LGOP, PADO, CFPA, and ADB. This will be finalized after review at the pilot final \nassessment workshop, presented at the international forum, and broadly disseminated. The \nreport will identify  ", "18  Appendix 2 \n(i)  key  processes  associated  with  the  pilot-test  (e.g.,  capacity  building,  NGO-led \nconsultation with communities, equity in beneficiary participation and impacts, NGO \ncooperation with village committees and local governments, stakeholder attitudes, \netc.); \n(ii)  successes in reducing poverty, increasing incomes, empowering communities, and \nother outcomes; and \n(iii)  challenges, shortfalls (e.g., capacity gaps), and issues affecting sustainability and \nreplicability, as well as viable recommendations for actions by governments and \n(secondarily) international agencies and other external actors to address these.   \n \n27.  The report will provide comparative evidence in these dimensions across pilot, control, \nand hybrid villages, as a basis for comparing the efficacy of NGO-implemented projects with \nconventional PA work.
