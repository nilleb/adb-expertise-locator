During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country programming mission in December \n2012, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested ADB assistance for \nthe development of railway container transport. A fact-finding mission visited the PRC in August \n2013 and reached agreement with the government on the technical assistance (TA) impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  With  ongoing  industrialization  and  urbanization,  the  PRC\u2019s  logistics  industry  has \nexperienced  rapid  growth.  The  total  value  added  of  logistics  services  increased  from \nCNY1.88 trillion in 2005 to CNY3.50 trillion in 2012. The National Development and Reform \nCommission predicts this will reach CNY4.97 trillion by 2015.2  \n \n3.  Increasing the use of railway transport could improve the efficiency of logistics and \nreduce costs. The railway network has been growing at 3.15% annually from 71,900 kilometers \n(km) in 2002 to 98,000 km in 2012. The operating length of double-track railways reached \n44,000 km from 23,900 km, accounting for 44.9% of the network. Electrified railways increased \nto 51,000 km from 18,100 km, representing 52.0% of the total. The new high-speed passenger \nrailway network introduced in 2008 reached a total length of 9,356 km in 2012. As passenger \ntransport services increasingly shift to the dedicated high-speed passenger network, previous \ncapacity  bottlenecks  on  dual-use  rail  lines  are  being  reduced  and  opportunities  arise  for \nexpanding higher value added railway freight services, including rail container services. \n \n4.  While rail freight has grown rapidly, the role of container services remains small and \nunderdeveloped  due  to  poor  connectivity  with  other  modes  and  insufficient  business \ncollaborations with potential service chain partners in the inland waterway, marine, aviation and \nroad transport sectors. From 2004 to 2012, average annual freight traffic increased by 6.4%, \nfrom 1,551.55 billion ton-km to 2,889.10 billion ton-km. In 2012, rail container traffic reached \n4.71 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) from 3.11 million TEU in 2004. In 2005 and 2011, \nthe modal shares for container traffic in TEU were 58.21% and 57.65% by roads, 37.25% and \n37.99% by water, and 4.54% and 4.36% by rail. Rail container traffic represented only 2.38% of \ntotal railway freight traffic by weight, compared with 37% in the United States and 20% in the \nEuropean Union. \n \n5.  Shifting container transport to railways from other modes, especially from road transport, \nwould  alleviate  traffic  congestion  on  roads;  reduce  fuel  consumption;  and  contribute  to \nmitigating adverse environmental and climate change effects, and improving citizen\u2019s health by \nreducing air pollution from vehicle emissions. The China Railway Corporation (CRC) recognizes \nthis opportunity and has been making efforts to upgrade its outdated container infrastructure \nand equipment.3 By 2012, 18 new railway container transport terminals had been constructed, \nand 5 of the 33 existing container-handling stations upgraded. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 August 2013. \n2  National Development and Reform Commission. 2011. The Significant Achievement of Developing Logistics \nIndustry During 11th Five Year Plan (2006\u20132010). http://www.sdpc.gov.cn/jjyx/xdwl/t20110119_391455.htm \n3  The railway reform introduced in March 2013 transferred railway operations responsibilities of the former Ministry of \nRailways to CRC. \n ", "2  \n6.  In a broader context, expansion of CRC\u2019s intermodal container transportation services, \nparticularly in the underdeveloped landlocked provinces in the central and western regions, will \nsupport the PRC\u2019s western development strategy to narrow the gap between the coastal region \nand the central and western regions. It is also essential for lowering the PRC\u2019s overall logistics \ncost to gross domestic product ratio. This ratio is currently more than 18%, which is twice that of \nthe European Union and the United States. The PRC\u2019s high ratio is a challenge for its global \ncompetitiveness and hampers the speed of economic development in the western PRC. \n \n7.  A key issue for rail container transport development is how to improve CRC\u2019s container \nmarketing  capacity.  CRC  needs  to  develop  modern  marketing  methods,  learning  from \nintermodal marketing experience of railways in the European Union and the United States. This \nincludes (i) applying strategy management and marketing management tools to analyze cargo \nshippers and competitors, and determining the proper position for CRC\u2019s rail container services \nin the market; (ii) creating the necessary services and products to attract customers in targeted \nmarket segments; (iii) selecting the most effective channels for marketing container transport \nservices to various shipper groups; and (iv) determining the optimal compensation scheme for \nCRC service chain partners.4 \n \n8.  In developed countries, multimodal transportation has proved to be a good approach to \noffer competitive container services and maximize efficiency. A rail-based intermodal container \nsystem (RICS) integrates other modes where they offer advantages on the route between origin \nand destination, and provides door-to-door services rather than merely station-to-station. In \naddition, containerization provides an opportunity to increase the value of transport services by \nincluding  supplemental  services,  such  as  door-to-door  transport,  packaging,  as  well  as \ntransloading.  Railway  container  transport  development  can  play  a  key  role  in  an  efficient \nmultimodal transport system due to its efficiency for long-distance transport. However, the \nPRC\u2019s railway container transport services lack cooperation with potential business partners in \nthe inland waterway, marine, aviation, and road transport sectors. This reduces rail container \ntransport\u2019s competitiveness and prevents CRC from capturing a larger share of the freight \ntransport  market  despite  the  potential  advantages  of  offering  low-cost,  safe,  all-weather \ntransportation across a large network. \n \n9.  CRC needs to set up a properly designed system to provide high-quality container \nservices at a competitive cost. This would include selecting the optimal location for multimodal \ncontainer  transport  hubs;  adopting  suitable  designs  and  layouts  for  container  handling; \ndeveloping  seamless  interfaces  with  other  transport  networks  (e.g.,  highway,  sea,  river, \npipeline); and establishing information technology platforms to share information with service \nchain partners (e.g., drayage carriers) and customers. \n \n10.  Appropriate institutional arrangements will be critical for the efficient management and \noperation of the RICS. Whereas international experience indicates that a RICS is most effective \nwhen  operated  on  a  competitive  environment,  CRC\u2019s  current  railway  container  transport \nmanagement system is planning oriented and inward looking, with monopolistic characteristics. \nChina Railway Container Company, owned by CRC, has been working as a booking agency \nunder CRC, rather than as an independent operating company. Railway administration bureaus \nmanage the container-handling stations and provide container transportation services to clients. \nCRC  receives  revenue  from  container  transportation;  then  distributes  it  to  various  railway \nadministration bureaus and China Railway Container Company. Such revenue distribution is \n                                                 \n4  For example, this may include use of door-to-door revenue sharing instead of markups over CRC\u2019s rates, which \ncould help CRC reap a higher percentage of the value created. \n ", "  3  \noften based on the financial need of each business unit and not based on profit contribution. \nThis arrangement entails unnecessary coordination costs and leads to low operating efficiency. \nCRC realizes that it urgently needs to restructure its container operation system to support \nservice  quality  improvements  and  become  more  market  oriented,  user  friendly,  and \noperationally efficient. \n \n11.  The RICS is a new concept for CRC and will require intensive capacity development. \nCRC, through the government, is seeking ADB assistance to develop its approach to railway \ncontainer transport development and strengthen its associated capacity. The TA is in line with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 20205 and Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan,6 which identify \nrailway  container  transport  and  logistics  development  as  a  strategic  priority  and  a  core \noperational subsector to achieve sustainability, energy efficiency, and emissions reduction. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be a sustainable, efficient, and environment-friendly RICS that supports \ndomestic and regional trade and logistics efficiency in the PRC. The achievement of this impact \nwill  be  demonstrated  by  rapidly  increasing  domestic  and  cross-border  railway  container \ntransport traffic and reduced logistics cost. The outcome will be a RICS development strategy \nand railway container transport market development program adopted by CRC. \n \n13.  The TA outputs will comprise (i) a report and recommendations for a RICS development \nstrategy,  (ii)  a  railway  container  transport  market  development  study,  and  (iii)  a  plan  for \noperations and institutional development for market-oriented and efficient operations. \n \n14.  A policy brief for senior government and CRC leaders will be released with the final \nreport.  It  will  summarize  the  TA  findings  on  international  best  practices;  lessons  from  the \nexperience of development of rail container services in other countries; and the recommended \nRICS development strategy for the PRC, supported by implementable market development and \norganization development plans that can be launched within a year. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The key activities to attain the TA outputs include the following: \n \n(i)  Conduct a comprehensive market analysis to understand the dynamics of the \nPRC\u2019s container transport market, including (a) the current size of the market and \nthe achievable size in 3\u20135 years with improvement in CRC service and handling \ncapacity; (b) the strengths and weaknesses of competing modes (e.g., highway, \ninland waterway, coastal); (c) CRC\u2019s strategy to increase market penetration for \nthat segment of the market and to strengthen its strategy with partners in serving \nthe containerized transport market; and (d) the reasons why CRC has not been \nsuccessful  in  expanding  its  container  traffic  and  what  can  be  learned  from \ninternational experience. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "4  \n(ii)  Study international best practices and lessons applicable for railway container \ntransport  development;  identify  gaps  between  CRC  and  major  container \ncompanies in developed countries; and draw upon the results of the analysis and \ndevelop recommendations, including for CRC\u2019s container development strategy. \n(iii)  Recommend steps that can be adopted by CRC management to (a) transform its \noperating culture and develop a productive, effective organization; (b) increase \nservice quality and operating efficiency; (c) penetrate and grow the targeted \nmarket segments; (d) manage the revenue streams for long-term profitability; and \n(e) work with marketing and operations partners to deliver a high-quality, door-to-\ndoor service at competitive cost. \n \n16.  The TA will include two international study tours and two domestic training events on \nRICS planning, management, operations and marketing. The international study tours will be \nused  to  benchmark  international  best  practices,  initiate  discussions  with  potential  strategic \npartners  and  obtain  training  in  modern  logistics  management  from  recognized  academic \ninstitutions. Two workshops will be conducted at the inception and interim report stages to \ndiscuss the objectives, solicit inputs, share knowledge, and review TA accomplishments. A \nseminar will be arranged at the final report stage to disseminate the international best practices \nand  TA  findings.  The  TA  will  be  undertaken  in  close  consultation  with  relevant  CRC \ndepartments,  the  government,  user  groups,  potential  partners,  private  sector  stakeholders, \ninternational development partners, and other relevant agencies. It will take into consideration \nprevious  studies carried  out  by  the  government,  ADB,  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-\noperation  and  Development,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  agencies.  CRC  will  provide  the \nconsultants with relevant data, materials, recent studies, and reports required for the TA; assist \nin arranging workshops and the seminar; and liaise with government, relevant agencies, and \nstakeholders. The TA will involve research, fieldwork, training, stakeholder consultations, and \nknowledge transfer. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $570,000, of which $450,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart professional and support staff; office space with furniture; utilities (including \nhigh-speed  internet  and  telecommunication  access);  materials,  maps,  available  data,  and \ndocuments required by the TA; local transportation to field study sites; cost of interpreters; and \nother support. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  As  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  CRC  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  and \nmonitoring  TA  activities.  A  leading  group  comprising  representatives  of  the  State  Railway \nAdministration  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport,  ocean  shipping  companies,  and  relevant  CRC \ndepartments  will  be  established  to  meet  regularly,  oversee  implementation,  and  provide \nguidance to the consultants. Additional leading group meetings will be held when specific issues \nneed to be discussed. A project coordinator will be assigned to supervise and coordinate day-to-\nday TA activities; monitor progress; resolve problems; arrange meetings; and liaise with relevant \nCRC departments and other concerned entities including the National Development and Reform \nCommission,  private  logistics  operators,  and  transport  providers.  Consultations  with \nstakeholders, particularly those from the private sector such as major shippers and receivers, \ntransport intermediaries, logistics operators, and potential partners from other modes will be \nheld monthly to strengthen the involvement of stakeholders during TA implementation. \n ", "  5  \n19.  The TA will require about 20 person-months of national and about 9 person-months of \ninternational consulting services. ADB will engage a team of national consultants through a \nconsulting firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality and cost \nweighting of 90:10. A simplified technical proposal will be required in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  90:10 \nweighting is appropriate because (i) the TA is an advanced assignment requiring a high degree \nof expertise in RICS development; and (ii) the TA is likely to have a significant impact on the \nfuture development of sustainable railway and integrated transport systems in the PRC. ADB \nwill engage individual international consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  Individual  consultants  are  needed,  as  the  TA  covers  specializations  such  as \nrailways, containerization, and logistics that are unlikely to be available within a single firm. The \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Any procurement under the TA \nwill be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented from 15 May 2014 to 31 December 2015. The consultants \nwill submit regular working papers, inception report, interim report, draft final report and final \nreport to CRC and ADB. All reports are to be submitted in English. Details of the requirements \nfor working papers and reports are in the Appendix 3. \n \n22.  The consultants will hold regular coordination meetings with CRC and stakeholders to \ndiscuss  and  address issues  they  face.  Workshops  will  be  held  periodically  to present  the \nfindings and recommendations of the working papers, and report and solicit feedback from key \nstakeholders.  Major  project  activities  will  be  regularly  monitored  by  and  reported  to  ADB \nadministration missions and CRC. Consultants\u2019 reports will be presented at workshops and \nseminars organized to validate and disseminate their findings. The reports and performance of \nconsultants will be monitored and evaluated by CRC, ADB staff, and peer reviewers at critical \nstages. The reports will be posted on the ADB website in a timely manner. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Railway  Container  Transport \nDevelopment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and  \nand Indicators with  Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nA sustainable,  Railway container traffic  Government and  Government, CRC, and \nefficient, and  volume increases to  CRC statistics  stakeholder interest and \nenvironment friendly  8.48 million twenty foot    continuous implementation \nrail-based intermodal  equivalent unit (TEU) in  of recommended \ncontainer system that  2020 from 4.71 million  improvement methods are \nsupports domestic  TEU in 2012.  sustained even after TA \nand regional trade    completion. \nand logistics efficiency  CRC and the government \nInternational railway \nin the PRC  completely implement the \ncontainer traffic volume \n  strategy for sustainable \nincreases to 2.11 million \nrailway container transport \nTEU in 2020 from 1.23 \ndevelopment. \nmillion TEU in 2012. \nLogistics cost to gross \ndomestic product ratio \ndecreases to 14% by 2020 \nfrom 18.1% in 2012. \n \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nRICS development  RICS development  ADB TA completion  CRC willingly incorporates \nstrategy and market  strategy and market  report   international best practice \ndevelopment program  development program  CRC plans, reports,  into railway container \nadopted by CRC  accepted by CRC by 2016  guidelines, and  transport development. \n  regulations on   \nrailway container  Risk \ntransport  Cooperation and \ndevelopment  coordination between \ndifferent modes of \ncontainer transport is poor \nor lacking. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
