I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $75,000,000 to GMR Megawide Cebu Airport Corporation (GMCAC) for the Mactan \nCebu International Passenger Terminal Project in the Philippines.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  The  Philippines  is  an  archipelago  of  more  than  7,100  islands  spread  over  almost \n300,000 square kilometers. The archipelagic topography increases the nation\u2019s difficulties in \ndisseminating the benefits of robust economic growth to the country\u2019s population and improving \nliving standards of the country\u2019s poor, many of whom are scattered in remote islands including \nthose in the central and southern regions.2 Development of an efficient transport network is \ncritical to achieve seamless movement of people and goods across the country and beyond; \nand to extend the benefits of economic and social growth to more of the population.3 \n \n3.  With respect to transport infrastructure, the Global Competitiveness Report, 2013\u20132014 \nranked the Philippines 113th for airports and 116th for seaport facilities out of 148 countries.4 \nThis underscores the extent to which the country has lagged in the development of critical \ninfrastructure, which is a key bottleneck to sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the \ncountry.  A  World  Bank  study  reported  that  the  Philippines\u2019  investments  in  infrastructure \nrepresented an average of only 2.1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980\u20132009, which \nwas  far  below  the  World  Bank\u2019s  benchmark  of  5%  of  GDP.  As  a  result,  the  country\u2019s \ninfrastructure is in a dire state\u2014deterring investments in other key sectors such as industry and \nagribusiness. \n \n4.  Public resources to support infrastructure development are limited in the Philippines. The \nGovernment of the Philippines has promoted public\u2013private partnership (PPP) for infrastructure \ndevelopment  to  address  the  constraints.  In  support  of  government  initiatives,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  approved  technical  assistance  (TA)  in  20115 to  improve  the \ngovernment\u2019s PPP design and capacity, and to finance the bid preparation and implementation \nof PPP projects, including the project, being administered by the Philippine PPP Center.6 The \nproject would be the first large scale PPP project awarded by government under its PPP \nagenda. \n                                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 The country has seen robust economic growth despite the global financial crisis and recession. The government \nreported gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.2% in 2013 and 6.7% in 2012. \n3  The Philippines\u2019 challenges remain, for example, as in the poverty incidence at 19.7% in 2012, according to the \nNational Statistics Coordination Board. Unemployment is another example, at an estimated 12.1 million or about \n27.5% of the population of adults in the labor force during the last quarter of 2013 as reported by Social Weather \nStations in February 2014. \n4  World Economic Forum. 2013. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2013\u20132014. Geneva. \nhttp://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2013-14.pdf. \n5  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Strengthening Public\u2013Private Partnerships. \nManila (February). \n6  Since the Philippines PPP program was launched in 2010, eight projects, (including this project) have been \nsuccessfully awarded to the private sector concessionaire through a competitive and transparent bidding process \nas of 15 September 2014. Another six projects are going through the tender processes. The government hopes to \naward 15 PPP projects before the end of the term of the current administration in June 2016. ", "2 \n \n5.  The Mactan Cebu International Airport (MCIA) is located in the province of Cebu, Central \nVisayas region. The region, which is composed of four island provinces with a population of 6.8 \nmillion  in  2010,  is  a  major  regional  economy  accounting  for  6.2%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross \ndomestic product. It is among the three fastest growing regions with annual average growth of \n7.9% in 2010\u201320117. Cebu, which is the region\u2019s center, is one of the most developed provinces \nin the country and the second most populated province with a population of about 4.2 million in \n2010. The economy of Cebu is the largest after Metro Manila. The major economic driver of \ngrowth for Cebu is tourism, industries and business process outsourcing. The island of Cebu is \nthe most accessible place in the country with more domestic air and sea linkages than any other \ncity in the Philippines, which is an ideal location for trade and industry. The province is also a \npopular vacation destination of both international and domestic tourists.   \n \n6.  The MCIA is the international gateway to Visayas. There are no other airports in the \nregion that is designed to handle high volume of international traffic. Opened for commercial \noperations in the 1960s, MCIA is designed to serve 4.5 million passengers per annum (mppa). \nThe government\u2019s liberalization of the airline industry and increased focus on tourism and \nindustrial and commercial development have resulted in an increasing number of flights and \npassengers using the country\u2019s airports, including the MCIA.8 The airport has experienced \nimpressive passenger growth over the past decade and in 2012, MCIA served more than 6.7 \nmillion passengers. This has strained airport infrastructure, affected service and passenger \nconvenience, and exposed the airport\u2019s lack of capacity to handle more passengers, especially \nduring peak hours. Without the proposed expansion at MCIA, the infrastructure constraint could \nlimit further growth  in  the tourism  and  other key  sectors,  which  are essential  in  providing \nemployment opportunities for sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the region.    \n \n7.  The  Department  of  Transportation  and  Communication  (DOTC)  and  Mactan  Cebu \nInternational  Airport  Authority  (MCIAA)  launched  an  invitation  to  bid  for  the  project  on \n21 December  2012.  Seven  groups  responded  to  the  invitation  and  submitted  bids  on \n28 November 2013 for a concession right to the project.9 The consortium of GMR Infrastructure \nLtd (GIL) and Megawide Construction Corporation (MCC) submitted the highest bid by offering a \npremium of P14.4 billion for the rights to the project. The notice of award was issued to the GIL\u2013\nMCC consortium by DOTC on 4 April 2014. The government and the GIL-MCC consortium \nsigned  the  Mactan  Cebu  airport  concession  agreement  on  22  April  2014.  ADB  was  in \ndiscussions with the consortium, before the bid, for its potential financial assistance to the \nproject.  The  project  fully  meets  ADB\u2019s  strategic,  country,  and  sector  approaches  for \ninfrastructure development and poverty reduction. \n \n2.  Project Design \n8.  The  project  involves  (i)  construction  of  a  new  passenger  terminal  with  a  designed \ncapacity of 8 mppa, (ii) renovation of the existing passenger terminal with a designed capacity of \n4.5 mppa,10 (iii) construction of an apron for the new passenger terminal, (iv) development and \nconstruction of commercial facilities, and (v) the operation and management of both passenger \n                                                                 \n7   Regional Development Council. Central Visayas Region. www.rdc7.net.ph \n8  The government has increased focus on building the country\u2019s tourism industry to boost air traffic to the country, \nwith the aim of attracting 10 million visitors per year by the end of 2017, up from almost 4.7 million visitors in 2013. \n9 The seven groups are (i) AAA Airports Partners (Ayala, Aboitiz, ADBC & HAS consortium); (ii) Filinvest and Changi \nAirport consortium; (iii) First Philippine Airports (Lopez and Infratil Asia consortium); (iv) GMR Infrastructure and \nMegawide consortium; (v) MPIC, JG Summit, and Aeroports de Lyon Consortium; (vi) Premier Airport Group \n(Zurich Airport, Citadel, and SM Group); and (vii) SMC and Incheon Airport Group. \n10 The renovation would be undertaken after construction of the new passenger terminal is completed. ", "3 \nterminals and commercial facilities over a 25-year concession period starting from the handover \ndate.  During  the  term  of  the  concession,  GMCAC  may  undertake  capital  expenditures  to \naugment  capacity  to  ensure  compliance  with  performance  standards  specified  under  the \nconcession agreement. \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n9.  GMCAC  is  a  special  purpose  vehicle  established  to  implement  the  project.  The \nsponsors, GIL and MCC, will contribute 40% (GIL) and 60% (MCC) of the equity.11 \n \n10.  GIL is a holding company based in India. It has a portfolio of investments in several \ninfrastructure  projects  in  four  segments:  airports,  energy,  road,  and  sports  and  urban \ninfrastructure. In the airports sector, GIL is considered the fourth largest private airport operator \nin the world, having invested about $4 billion in three airports.12 For the year ending March \n2013, the GIL airports handled close to 80 million passengers combined. GIL airports include \n(i) India\u2019s busiest airport, the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi; (ii) Rajiv Gadhi \nInternational Airport in Hyderabad; and (iii) Istanbul Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport in \nTurkey.13 Under the leadership of GIL, these airports received several accolades.14 \n \n11.  MCC is engaged in the general construction business in the Philippines. It is a publicly \nlisted company. MCC is recognized as a leader in the construction industry for the use of \nmodern technology. In addition to winning the project in partnership with GIL, MCC has won \nthree PPP projects\u2014the building of classrooms (Phase 1 and 2) and the modernization of the \nPhilippine Orthopedic Center, which it is implementing. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n1.  Impacts \n12.  The  project  will  contribute  to  (i)  improved  international  and  domestic  air  transport \nservices in the Philippines, and (ii) greater private sector investment in airport PPPs in the \nPhilippines. The government plans to establish a sustainable transport system in the Philippines \nthat would not only improve the mobility of the country\u2019s population but would also significantly \nincrease the development of the various provinces in the country. The project will demonstrate \nthe commitment of the government to provide critical infrastructure, the lack of which has \nimpeded economic growth and capital investments. Successful financing and implementation of \nthe project will encourage further investments in similar projects under a PPP arrangement. \n \n2.  Outcome \n13.  The outcome will be efficient and high-quality operations at the MCIA that meet required \nstandards. The outcome will be measured, among others, by increased international passenger \ntraffic  to  Cebu;  increased  air  traffic  movements;  achievement  of  at  least  International  Air \nTransport Association C service standards; and increased government revenues in the form of \n                                                                 \n11 The Philippines\u2019 constitution restricts foreign ownership of public utilities such as airports to 40% of equity. \n12 The three larger private airport operators are (i) Ferrovial S.A., (Spain), (ii) TAV (Turkey), and (iii) PSP Investments \n(Canada). \n13 GIL sold its equity stake in the Istanbul airport in December 2013. \n14 New Delhi airport was recognized as the second best airport in the 25\u201350 mppa category in 2012 by the Airports \nCouncil International; and the world\u2019s most improved airport in 2012 by SKYTRAX. Hyderabad Airport was \nrecognized in 2010, 2011, and 2012 as the second best airport in the world in the 5\u201315 mppa category in Airport \nService Quality; and India\u2019s third best airport in 2012 by SKYTRAX. Istanbul airport was cited the best airport in the \nWorld Low Cost Airline Awards in 2010. \n ", "4 \npremium payment for the concession and taxes from the project. The growth in passengers will \ngenerate direct and indirect employment opportunities in the province of Cebu. \n \n3.  Output \n14.  The project\u2019s output will be improved airport facilities at the MCIA, which will be reflected \nin (i) a new passenger terminal completed and another passenger terminal renovated and \noperational by 2019, (ii) passenger capacity increased from 4.5 million in 2014 to 12.5 million by \n2019, and (iii) about 400 workers employed for construction work.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n15.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which aims to \nachieve inclusive economic growth in its developing member countries through the provision of \ninfrastructure  that  would  connect  the  poor  to  markets  and  increase  their  access  to  basic \nproductive assets.15 Strategy 2020 promotes PPP arrangements in the transport sector and \nencourages ADB support for PPP projects through direct financing. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132016 aims to help the country achieve high, \ninclusive, and sustainable growth.16 The strategy supports infrastructure development, which \nincludes improvement of the country\u2019s port operations through PPP arrangements. \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative  emphasizes  private  sector  participation  in \ntransport as an integral part of mainstreaming sustainable transport in its developing member \ncountries.17 \n \nD.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n19.  The proposed ADB assistance is a direct loan of up to $75 million. The loan will be \ndenominated  in  US  dollars.  The  financing  agreements  will  contain  standard  provisions  for \ntransactions of this nature. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n20.  ADB\u2019s support for the project is justified based on the following: \n(i)  The successful implementation of the first large infrastructure project awarded \nunder  the  government\u2019s  PPP  program  would  attract  interest  in  long-term \ninvestments in the country. ADB\u2019s involvement will help ensure the government\u2019s \nlong-term  support  for  the  project,  which  would  give  comfort  to  international \ninvestors and lenders. \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s investment in the project will help ensure that GMCAC will adopt best \npractices in airport terminal operations including ADB\u2019s safeguard standards, \nwhich could be replicated. \n(iii)  The proposed long-tenor debt from ADB plays a crucial role in ensuring the \neconomic and financial viability of the project. ADB will also contribute prudent \nstructuring of the financing package in line with regional models. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n21.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \n ", "6 \nindigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. The institutional capacity and \ncommitment of GMCAC to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed \nadequate.  \n \n22.  The social compliance audit included in the IEE confirmed that no land acquisition or \nresettlement issues, relevant to the existing facilities that will be rehabilitated, are pending. New \nfacilities will be constructed on a portion of state-owned land inside Mactan\u2013Benito Ebuen Air \nBase. Except for military buildings and facilities, no other informal structures or encroachments \nare inside the security controlled air base. The road network to be improved will be undertaken \non existing rights-of-way requiring no additional land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. \nCebu and Mactan are highly urbanized areas and no indigenous peoples, ethnic groups, or \ntribal groups in the project area fall under the category of indigenous peoples described in \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n23.  Other social dimensions. The project is categorized as having some gender elements. \nGMCAC is considering the project design features that cater to the needs of women and the \ndisabled. GMCAC is required to ensure that the design and features of the airport will follow the \nprovisions of the Philippine Accessibility Law (Batas Pambansa Bilang 344), 1982. GMCAC will \nalso  organize  orientation  and  training  programs  on  specialized  topics  such  as  HIV/AIDS \nawareness and trafficking of women. MCIAA personnel, whose functions are directly involved in \nthe terminal operations, were offered a transfer to GMCAC. Consultations have been carried out \nindicating no diminution of salary and benefits. GMCAC will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy and report regularly to ADB on their compliance (including contractors) with national \nlabor laws, and adherence to internationally recognized core labor standards.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n24.  The  sponsors  and  GMCAC  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best \ninternational practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of \nterrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n25.  The proposed direct loan is within the medium-term country, industry, group and single \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments.  \n \nD.  Assurances \n26.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of the Philippines will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the \nproposed assistance to GMCAC.
