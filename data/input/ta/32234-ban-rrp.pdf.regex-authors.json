The  initial  environmental  examination  and \nAssessment  environmental assessment review framework are summarized in a \nsupplementary appendix \n   \nSector Program  The Railway Sector Investment Program which is based on the \nDescription  Government\u2019s Sector Roadmap and Investment Plan for 2007\u2014\n2013  will  improve  the  performance  of  the  railway  sector  by \nimplementing (i) a reform project of sector policy, organizational, \nand capacity building reforms to make Bangladesh Railway (BR) \nmore  commercially  focused,  and  improve  governance  and \naccountability; and (ii) an investment project of infrastructure and \nrolling  stock  capacity  improvement  investments  to  overcome \ncapacity bottlenecks in sectors where such investments are both \neconomically and financially viable, e.g., the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \nand the Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridors where it can support \nmajor direct investment. The reform and the investment projects \nare  integrated  as  approval  of  investment  subprojects  will  be \ndependent on the implementation of specific reform actions.  \n   \nRationale  Efficient  transport  is  essential  to  achieve  higher  levels  of \neconomic  growth  needed  for  sustainable  poverty  reduction  in \nBangladesh. BR has been losing market share and consequently \nmaking financial losses thus relying on Government budgetary \nsupport. This financial support has not been enough to allow for \nadditional  investment  needed  in  critical  corridors  such  as  the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong  and  Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna  corridors  to \novercome  capacity  constraints  leading  to  poor  operational \nperformance of the railways. This in turn causes it to lose market \nshare thus worsening its financial performance. Greater use of \nrailways will ease the pressure on land since Bangladesh has a \nvery high population density and land is scare. It will also ease the \npressure on the road network, which is congested in key corridors \nand thus benefit transport as a whole. This will require capital \ninvestments and reforms to ensure that the investments lead to a \nsustainable  improvement  in  BR\u2019s  operational  and  financial \nperformance.  \n   \n ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Investment  Program  will  promote  sustainable  national \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  Bangladesh.  It  will \nachieve this by improving rail transport efficiency and capacity, \nthus  lowering  operating  costs  for  users  and  increasing  the \ncompetitiveness  of  Bangladesh  for  investment.  Foreign  direct \ninvestment totaling $5 billion by 2012 is currently expected. These \ninvestments are expected to increase Bangladesh\u2019s GDP by 2.9% \nor $60 billion over 30 years. A prerequisite of these investments is \nthat the BR is reformed and capacity constraints alleviated as \nproposed under the Investment Program.  \n   \nProgram Investment Plan   The Government\u2019s Railway Sector Roadmap and Investment Plan \nrequires  a  total  investment  of  $924.5  million  of  which  the \nInvestment Program to be implemented in five loans is estimated \nat $537.5 million, including taxes and duties of $43 million.  \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nFacility  extend  financing  of  $430  million  over  5  years  through  a \n  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF).  This  financing  represents \n46.5% of the total financing envisaged under the Government\u2019s \nInvestment Program and covers investment, reform, and capacity \nbuilding interventions. The MFF has a maximum utilization period \nof 7 years. Individual periodic financing requests (PFR) will be \nconverted into individual or separate loans. The Government has \nentered into a framework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB. \nThe FFA satisfies the requirements set forth in Pilot Financing \nInstruments and Modalities. Pursuant to the FFA, the Government \nhas submitted to ADB a PFR for $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) and $30 million from Asian Development \nFund (ADF) resources. The PFR for these two loans is presented \nto the Board, together with the FFA. Prior to acceptance of a PFR, \nADB will ensure that the Government and BR comply in full with \nthe terms and conditions of the FFA. ADB teams will conduct due \ndiligence  on  these  to  ensure  that  they  are  being  satisfactorily \nadhered to. The minimum loan size will be $30 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan   \n \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nADB Ordinary Capital Resources  400.00    43.27 \nAsian Development Fund  30.00    3.24 \nGovernment  107.50    11.63 \n     Total Investment Program   537.50    58.14 \nGovernment and Other Agencies  387.00    41.86 \n  Total    924.50    100.00 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n ", "  iii\n  An  MFF  of  $430,000,000  comprising  $400  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources and $30 million equivalent from the \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources  of  ADB  will  be \nprovided. Final terms and conditions will be determined in the \ncontext of each loan, and be based on prevailing policies within \nADB. OCR financing will be subject to interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The Government has the option to choose \nbetween  eligible  currencies  and  the  interest  rate  regime  most \nsuitable for each loan. ADB also provides flexibility in terms of \nrepayment and interest rate swaps during the financing period. \nRepayment schedules can be structured for each loan, in essence \nto match the needs of each batch of subprojects with their cost \nrecovery and sustainability profile. Financing from ADF resources \nequivalent to $30,000,000 will have an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as may be set forth in the appropriate \nloan agreement.  \n \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of Bangladesh will make all loans from this MFF \nTerms  available to BR under the respective loan agreements. Once BR \nis  transformed  into  a  government-owned  corporate  entity,  a \nproject agreement with BR will be required.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  1  December  2011  (Closing  date  for  submission  of  periodic \nfinancing requests) \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 for the Reform Project \nCompletion Date  31 December 2013 for the Investment Project \n   \nExecuting Agency   Bangladesh Railway \n   \nImplementation  BR  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Program.

An \ninterministerial committee co-chaired by the Secretary, MOC and \nthe Secretary, Finance Division, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and  \nconsisting  of  representatives  from  the  Economic  Relations \nDivision, MOF, the Ministry of Establishment, the Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice, BR, and other agencies as determined by the Borrower, \nhas  been  established  to  oversee,  monitor  and  provide  the \nnecessary policy guidance to both Project Directors. The Director \nGeneral,  BR  will  report  to  the  interministerial  committee  on  a \nregular basis.  ", "iv   \n   \nProcurement   All  contracts  will  use  international  competitive  bidding. \nProcurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines.  \n \nInternational and national consultants will be required to support \nthe reform and investment projects of the Investment Program \nThe consultants financed under the MFF loans will be engaged \nusing  ADB's  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The \nGovernment has asked ADB to select the consultants.  \n   \nInvestment Program  Implementation of the Investment Program will improve the overall \nBenefits and  efficiency of BR and transportation in the country, contributing to \nBeneficiaries  economic growth, employment creation, and income growth. It will \nalso  allow  the  release  of  Government  funds  from  budgetary \nsupport of the railways to other poverty reduction uses. These \nbenefits  will  be  widely  disseminated  across  the  country.  The \nprimary  quantifiable  economic  benefits  comprise  (i)  railway \noperating cost savings arising from faster travel times for both \ngoods and passenger services; (ii) savings in operating costs for \nfreight and passenger traffic arising from traffic diverted from road \nto rail made possible with the increase in rail capacity; (iii) savings \nin working capital loss for freight traffic arising from time savings, \nincluding elimination of waiting times to get slots on railways for \ngoods being transported; (vi) time savings for passengers arising \nfrom faster train travel times; (vii) facilitation of investment that \notherwise  would  not  take  place  because  an  efficient  railway \nsystem  is  a  prerequisite  for  such  investment;  and  (viii) \nemployment opportunities to poor people during construction. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The most significant risk for the Investment Program is that the \nreform measures will not be implemented in full and therefore \nimprovements in sector performance will be less than expected. \nThe  assumptions  are  that  other  factors  affecting  investment, \nexport growth, and economic development are in place; and the \npolitical and security situation remains stable so that investors are \nnot deterred by political risk factors. Economic growth is assumed \nto remain strong to ensure strong demand for rail services.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Advisory technical assistance of $2,000,000 will be provided for \nInstitutional Support for Railway Reforms. The proposed TA will \ncover fielding of international and national consultants to provide \n(i) advisory support to BR for reform implementation, (ii) improve \nrailway operation and maintenance practices; and (iii) carry out \nprocurement and performance audit. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program and is attached to the \nADF loan.  \n ", "  v\n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Railway \nSector Investment Program, and (ii) proposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Support \nfor Railway Reforms. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Introduction \n2.  During  the  past  decade  Bangladesh  achieved  an  annual  average  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth rate of 5%. However, to achieve poverty reduction targets and related \nmillennium development goals, a sustained annual GDP growth rate of from 7%\u20138% is needed.1 \nAs transport plays a crucial role in facilitating economic development, a safe, efficient, and \neconomical  transport  system  will  support  economic  growth  and  thus  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction. Between 1971 and 2005, annual transport demand by all mechanized modes in \nBangladesh increased by about 6% for passenger traffic and about 5% for freight. The share of \nrail transport steadily declined from 30% in 1974 to 13% in 2005 for passenger traffic and from \n28% to 7% for freight. The shift in modal split toward roads resulted from steady investments \nand improvements in road transport coupled with a decline in the quality and efficiency of rail \nservices. Greater use of railways will ease pressure on land; Bangladesh\u2019s very high population \ndensity means that land is scarce. It will also ease pressure on the road network, which is \ncongested in key corridors, and thus benefit transport as a whole. The Government, in its \nNational  Strategy  for  Accelerated Poverty  Reduction,  identifies  development  of  the  railway \nsector as important for poverty reduction because railways play a key role in accelerating \neconomic growth by reducing transport costs and improving the country\u2019s competitiveness for \nforeign and domestic direct investment.  \n \n3.  Bangladesh  Railway  (BR),  a  department  under  the  Ministry  of  Communications, \ncomprises  a  rail  network  of  2,855  route-kilometers  (km)  and  34,168  regular  employees. \nSupplementary Appendix A provides BR\u2019s organization chart. The network is divided into two \nzones: east and west, separated by the Jamuna River. The rail network includes 660 km of \nbroad gauge track within the West Zone, i.e., 1.676 meter width track. In addition the West Zone \nhas 553 km of meter gauge i.e., 1.0 meter width track. The East Zone has 1,277 km of meter \ngauge track,, and 365 km of dual gauge track (catering for both broad and meter gauge trains). \nJamuna Multipurpose Bridge, which has a dual gauge rail link, provides the only east\u2013west rail \nlink. Appendix 2 provides a sector analysis of the railway sector.  \n \n2.  Traffic \n4.  BR operates a mix of passenger and freight services. Passenger services dominate, \naccounting for over 83% of all traffic units2 in fiscal year (FY) 2005. Passenger traffic rose \nsteadily until 1983 when it reached a peak of 106 million passengers, then declined to about 40 \nmillion  passengers  in  FY2005.  Passenger-km  traveled  also  declined,  although  to  a  lesser \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2005. Country Strategy and Program 2006\u20132010: Bangladesh. Manila. \n2  Traffic units are the sum of passenger-kilometers and ton-kilometers.  \n ", "2   \nextent, reflecting an increase in journey length from 60 km in FY1983 to 100 km in FY2005. In \nFY2005, the traffic in terms of passenger-km was 4.16 billion. Passenger operations are divided \ninto three types of services: intercity trains, mail/express trains, and local passenger trains. \nDuring FY2005, about 40% of passengers traveled on intercity trains, 37% on mail/express \ntrains, and the remaining 23% on local passenger trains. Taken as a whole, BR\u2019s passenger \nservices are unprofitable, with intercity trains being a notable exception. Revenue from intercity \ntrains accounts for 73% of total passenger earnings. \n \n5.  The  importance  of  freight  operations  for  BR  is  highlighted  by  the  fact  that,  while \naccounting for less than 17% of total traffic units, their contribution to gross revenues in FY2005 \nwas nearly 34%. Freight traffic of 3.2 million tons in FY1983 decreased to 2.6 million tons in \nFY1996, but then increased during FY2005 to 3.2 million tons corresponding to 819 million ton-\nkm. BR\u2019s core business in freight revolves around five commodities: food grains, containers, \npetroleum products, fertilizer, and stones; together they make up about 72% of total freight \ntraffic.  Container  traffic  between  Dhaka  and  Chittagong  represents  an  important  growth \npotential. \n \n3.  Operational Performance \n \n6.  In  view  of  the  high  investment  cost  of  railway  infrastructure,  the  intensity  of  track \nutilization is an important dimension of productivity. Locomotive, coach, and wagon productivity \nare indicators of efficiency of utilization of a railway\u2019s assets, while staff productivity measures \nthe  efficiency  of  staff  utilization.  BR\u2019s  track  utilization;  locomotive,  coach,  and  wagon \nproductivity, as well as staff productivity figures are lower than that of other developing countries \nin the South and Southeast Asian regions.  \n \n7.  BR\u2019s loss of traffic partly explains the low productivity and operational performance \nstatistics;  if  traffic  was  at  the  levels  of  the  1970s  and  1980s,  then  the  productivity  and \noperational performance statistics would look better. However, the statistics also reflect the \nreality that BR\u2019s staffing was allowed to grow too large and BR has not been using its assets \nefficiently.  Labor  costs,  which  consumed  59.6%  of  operating  expenses  in  FY1992,  were \ngradually reduced to 41.5% in FY2005. This is the result of the voluntary staff separation \nprogram implemented with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance.3 One of BR\u2019s most \nserious operational problems is lack of capacity on its busiest routes, in particular the Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong and the Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridors. Many sections on these corridors have \nalready reached their maximum desirable line capacity. This results in low average speeds, low \nrolling stock turnaround times, and longer waiting times for cargo to find slots on wagons. \nContainers from Chittagong bound for Dhaka need to wait about 5\u20137 days to find a slot on \ncontainer trains. \n \n8.  Accidents, especially derailments, are another operational problem. In FY2005, the BR \nnetwork including main lines, branch lines, and yards, had a total of 566 derailments, i.e., an \nincrease  of  3%  compared  with  FY2004.  Although  these  derailments  did  not  result  in  any \nfatalities or injuries, they did cause delays in train operations and availability, and point to the \nneed for BR to improve operation and maintenance practices. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1994.

Manila. \n ", "  3\n  4.  Tariffs \n \n9.  Since BR has been tasked to meet social as well as economic objectives, social and \npolitical factors have often outweighed commercial considerations in the process of tariff setting. \nAs  a  result,  passenger  services  have  been  underpriced  and  cross-subsidized  by  freight \nservices.  Compared  with  other  countries,  the  ratio  of  BR\u2019s  average  passenger  fare  per \npassenger-km to average freight tariff per ton-km is very low. The ratio for Bangladesh is 0.26 \ncompared with 1.2 for the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2.2 for Japan, and 0.7 for Thailand. \nPassenger  services  account  for  83%  of  BR\u2019s  services,  but  contribute  only  58%  of  gross \nrevenues.  \n \n  5.  Outsourcing \n \n10.  Although no major privatization initiative has materialized, BR has introduced some \nprivate sector participation into segments of its activities with a view to augmenting its financial \nperformance and ensuring some customer orientation. The private sector has been active in the \nfollowing areas through outsourcing: \n \n(i)  commercial activities of passenger trains, \n(ii)  onboard services on intercity trains, \n(iii)  computerized ticketing and reservation systems, \n(iv)  operation of fiber optic telecommunications network, \n(v)  rehabilitation of passenger coaches, \n(vi)  cleaning of engines and passenger coaches, \n(vii)  conversion of non-air-conditioned coaches to air-conditioned, and \n(viii)  rehabilitation and maintenance of selected tracks. \n \n11.  To date, the private sector is carrying out ticketing on 76 mail/local passenger trains \nthrough outsourcing. This arrangement has provided BR with additional annual revenue of \nTk132 million from these 76 trains compared with when it ran the services itself. BR also obtains \nTk860 million a year from the leasing of its fiber optic cable network to the private sector. \n \n6.  Financial Performance \n12.  Like many other railways, BR is a loss-making entity. In FY2005, BR\u2019s revenue was \nTk4,456 million and operational costs Tk6,590 million, resulting in a loss of Tk2,134 million. The \nworking ratio, i.e., operating expenses divided by total revenues, is 1.36; and the operating ratio, \ni.e.,  operating  expenses  divided  by  operating  revenues,  is  1.46  excluding  provision  of \ndepreciation and public service obligation payments and welfare grants. Operating revenues are \nnot sufficient to cover operating expenses. The financial performance steadily declined since \nFY2000 as a result of stagnant passenger tariffs and freight volume. To make up for the losses, \nthe  Government  has  been  subsidizing  BR  through  deficit  financing.  The  staff  separation \nprogram in 1997\u20131998 only temporarily arrested the decline in financial performance. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n  1.  Challenges \n \n13.  BR has reached a critical juncture in its performance and is close to a cycle of decline \nexperienced by many other countries\u2019 railway services, i.e., lower revenue leading to a lack of \nmaintenance  and  investments,  causing  poor  services  and  contributing  further  to  reduced \n ", "4   \nrevenue.  While  railways  worldwide  face  increasing  competition  from  road,  air,  and  water \ntransport,  BR  faces  additional  challenges  in  overcoming  its  lack  of  commercial  focus:  low \nefficiency, poor service quality, political interference, aging fleet, and congested network on \nmajor corridors such as the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong and Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridors. The \nweaknesses in the railway sector are manifested in declining market share, adverse operating \nindicators, and reduced revenue generation. Their underlying causes are to be found in the \npolicy, institutional, and organizational arrangements for the railways, which are based on the \nidea of running railways as a social and economic arm of the Government rather than as a \nbusiness. Supplementary Appendix B provides a cause-effect tree analysis.  \n \n14.  The future performance of BR will depend on how effectively it can adapt its services to \nits changing market position. The fundamental challenges for BR are therefore to establish a \ncommercial orientation with a view to (i) arresting the decline in its share of the main market \nsegments; (ii) improving the profitability of its operations; and (iii) generating sufficient income to \nfinance necessary investments in selective capacity expansion, asset replacement, operational \nimprovements, and safety. This will require that BR (i) operate railway services using good \nbusiness principles, (ii) concentrate on core businesses, and (iii) prioritize new investments \nbased on financial and economic returns that will improve performance and capacity in major \npotential markets. These include the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong and Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridors, \nwhich cater to Bangladesh imports and exports and can support potential major investments.  \n \n2.  External Assistance \n \n15.  ADB has been the lead agency in the railway sector providing assistance to improve the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong4 and  Khulna\u2013Parbatipur  lines5 and  for  the  Jamuna  Bridge  Railway  Link \nProject.6 In addition, ADB approved a program loan for the railway sector designed to support \nthe Government\u2019s macroeconomic stabilization program (footnote 3). Other agencies previously \nactive in the railway sector are the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC); and \nbilateral agencies from Canada, France, Germany, Norway, Saudi Arabia, and Spain. Appendix \n3 provides a summary of past external assistance to BR. None of the agencies mentioned \ncurrently has an active assistance program. However, Japan Bank for International Cooperation \n(JBIC) allowed using $25 million from its Bangladesh debt repayment forgiveness program for \nsmall-scale railway infrastructure improvements. The World Bank and JBIC are considering \nproviding assistance to the railway sector.  \n \n  3.  Lessons Learned \n \n16.  The program performance audit report for the Railway Recovery Program (footnote 3)7 \nfound that program loan as a lending modality was inadequate to achieve and sustain the \nprogram\u2019s objective of BR breaking even against working expenses. BR faces many inherent \nphysical constraints relating to inadequate infrastructure and aging rolling stock that cannot be \naddressed purely by the policy and institutional reforms pursued. Without alleviating the physical \nconstraints,the  program\u2019s  objectives  could  not  be  sustained  even  if  they  were  temporarily \nachieved and all the reforms were to be implemented. The audit report recommends that a \nsector development program8 rather than a program loan would be more effective in providing \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1974.

The current Investment \nProgram  design  follows  this  holistic  approach  using  an  MFF  modality.  Of  the  Investment \nProgram\u2019s two projects, the Reform Project addresses sector policy, organizational reform, and \ncapacity constraints; and the Investment Project will assist in overcoming infrastructure and \nrolling  stock  constraints.  The  attached  TA  will  provide  institutional  support  for  the  Reform \nProject. This holistic approach will enable the proposed intervention to achieve both policy \nreforms  and  infrastructure  improvements  needed  for  sustainable  improvement  of  BR\u2019s \noperational and financial performance.  \n \n17.  The program performance audit report pointed out that the 1994 program demonstrates, \nin  an  adverse  fashion,  that  policy-based  lending  cannot  be  successful  without  sustained \ncommitment to reforms by the Government and concerned institutions. The report found that \nalthough  commitment  was  present  at  the  beginning,  it  wavered  or  was  not  passed  on  to \nsuccessive governments or BR management teams. The same lack of commitment was seen in \nthe 1997 Jamuna Bridge Railway Link Project. Although the infrastructure works in this project \nwere implemented satisfactorily, the key reform covenants, e.g., becoming more commercially \noriented and corporatizing BR were not implemented. The current Investment Program design \ntherefore links investment loan approvals to implementation reform milestones to create the \nproper incentives to for the Government and BR to sustain commitment to implement reform. \nThe reform itself has been carefully designed on a sequential building block basis so that \nimplementation of the reform is more manageable to increase its chances of success, while at \nthe  same  time  creating  an  irreversible  reform  process.  A  detailed  analysis  of  the  lessons \nlearned and how the design for the current Investment Program incorporates these lessons \nlearned is shown in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n   4.  Opportunities \n \n18.  On the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor, demand for rail container and petroleum transport \nservices is significant. Containers make up the most profitable freight segment, accounting for \n22% of BR\u2019s freight revenue. The service is convenient, cheaper than by road, and popular. \nChittagong Port receives about 600,000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) containers annually \nand the volume growth is about 15% per annum. About 75% of these are for the Dhaka area, \ni.e., about 450,000 TEU. BR is currently able to capture only a fraction of this traffic (about \n43,100 TEU or about 10%). The balance is taken to Dhaka by road, although laden containers \ncannot be taken by road between the two cities; containers are first unloaded at Chittagong \nPort. This is not only wasteful in terms of resources as each container is loaded onto 3\u20134 lorries, \nbut  also  defeats  the  economic  benefits  of  containerization.  BR\u2019s  low  market  share  of  this \nprofitable market segment mainly results from it not being able to offer more container trains \ndue to infrastructure, rolling stock capacity, and management constraints. Currently containers \nhave to wait 5\u20137 days to secure a place on BR trains. Opportunities for rail freight traffic in the \nDhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridor could materialize if planned foreign private sector investment \ntotaling $5 billion for a steel mill at Ishurdi and a coal mine at Pulbari is implemented.9 If these \nproposals materialize, rail freight traffic is projected to increase by 10 million tons by 2010 and \n15 million tons by 2015. It will also enhance regional cooperation and increase trade between \nBangladesh and India. Private sector parties involved in these proposals have informed the \nGovernment  that  reform  of  rail  organization  as  well  as  infrastructure  improvements  are \nprerequisites for the proposed projects to be implemented.  \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department is involved in talks to take an equity share in some of these projects.  \n ", "6   \n19.  Intercity trains have emerged as the most popular and only profitable component of BR \npassenger services; they carry about 40% of passengers while contributing about 73% of \npassenger revenue. Nonrevenue (ticketless) travel is not possible on intercity trains, which only \nhave  reserved  seat  accommodation.  BR  runs  four  intercity  trains  between  Dhaka  and \nChittagong daily. They run full and demand growth is pronounced. Their speeds, journey time, \nand fares are competitive with road service. The trains complete the 321 km journey in 6\u20137 \nhours at a cost of Tk130, compared with 5 hours by road (the road distance is shorter\u2014270 km) \nat Tk150 per passenger. However, due to lack of line capacity and low throughput on the \ncorridor, more intercity trains cannot be introduced to satisfy the latent demand. Increased \nrailway modal share for freight and passengers in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor will also \nbenefit the corridor transport network by relieving congestion in the road network. Thus road \nusers will also benefit from faster travel times, lower operating costs, and reduced negative \nexternalities such as incremental pollution from traveling in congested traffic.  \n \n  5.  ADB Strategy \n \n20.  Improving the efficiency of the railway sector to address transport bottlenecks is one of \nthe main elements of ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Bangladesh for 2006\u20132010 \n(footnote 1). Improved transport infrastructure and services are essential to improve the overall \ninvestment  climate,  and  thus,  achieve  the  higher  levels  of  economic  growth  needed  for \nsustainable development and poverty reduction. More efficient railway services will facilitate \neconomic growth. This will raise incomes and create employment, thereby helping to reduce \npoverty.  Improved  financial  performance  by  BR  will  reduce  the  need  to  finance  railway \ninvestments and operating expenditure from budgetary sources, thereby, freeing up resources \nto be used for other priority sectors. The country strategy and program also points out that \nbecause Bangladesh has a very high population density and tremendous land scarcity, the \nrailway system needs to play a much more prominent role in the transport system. This is \nespecially true in areas where rail can operate at lower costs and with less environmental \ndamage. ADB\u2019s sector strategy aims to bring about overall improvements in the railway sector \nby (i) supporting policy, organizational, and legal reforms to restructure BR to a market-oriented \nbusiness organization with improved financial governance, human resource, and operational \nsystems; and eventually to be transformed into a new government-owned corporate entity; and \n(ii) financing economically and financially viable investments in strategic rail corridors of the \ncountry.  \n \n6.  Sector Road Map \n \n21.  ADB has engaged in intensive policy dialogue with the Government to improve railway \nsector performance. As a result of this policy dialogue the Government has agreed with ADB on \na sector road map. The road map outlines sector (i) objectives, (ii) policies, (iii) reforms, and (iv) \ninvestments. The objective is to increase the freight carried by rail along the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \nand Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridors by 115% each,, as well as increase the modal share of \nrail containers from 12% to 26%. The policies outlined in the road map are to (i) improve the \ninstitutional capability of BR, (ii) enhance the operational capacity of BR, (iii) obtain a greater \nshare of the freight market, (iv) improve financial efficiency, (vi) ensure efficient provision and \nmanagement of railway infrastructure, (vii) reduce involvement in nonrail activities, (vii) improve \nrailway safety, and (viii) encourage greater private sector participation in railways. The railway \nreform and institutional strengthening program formulated in the sector road map in line with the \npolicies are to (i) restructure BR by line of business (LOB), (ii) improve financial governance, (iii) \nimprove human resource governance, (iv) transform BR into a government-owned corporate \nentity,  and  (v)  improve  BR  operation  and  maintenance.  The  reform  and  institutional \n ", "  7\nstrengthening actions will be complemented by the investment program outlined in the sector \nroad map. These include (i) double-tracking in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor, (ii) improving \nsignaling along the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong and Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridors, (iii) rehabilitating \nyards and extending loop lines, and (iv) procuring rolling stock. Improving the operational and \nfinancial efficiency of BR will enable a reduction in budget support to BR. The details of the \nsector road map are given in Appendix 4.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n22.  The  Railway  Sector  Investment  Program  is  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  Sector \nRoadmap and Investment Plan for 2007-2013 The Investment Program will promote sustainable \nnational economic growth and poverty reduction in Bangladesh. It will achieve this by improving \nrail transport efficiency and capacity, thus lowering operating costs for users and increasing the \ncompetitiveness of Bangladesh for investment. Foreign direct investment totaling $5 billion by \n2012 is currently expected. These investments are expected to increase Bangladesh\u2019s GDP by \n2.9% or $60 billion over 30 years. A prerequisite of these investments is that BR is reformed \nand capacity constraints alleviated as proposed under this Investment Program.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n23.  The  Investment  Program  will  ensure  that  BR  becomes  a  commercially  focused  rail \nservice provider, and that rail infrastructure and rolling stock constraints are alleviated. It will \nhave two mutually reinforcing components, i.e., the Reform Project and the Investment Project. \nThe proposed reforms will help ensure that the proposed investment to increase capacity will \nlead to a sustainable improvement in BR\u2019s operational and financial performance. \n \n24.  Investment Project. This will finance priority investments, i.e., those that strengthen \nBR\u2019s  core  business  activities  and  that  form  part  of  BR\u2019s  main  route  network.  Investment \nsubprojects will concentrate on enhancing capacity to overcome constraints to increasing rail \nservices in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong and Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridors where demand for \nintercity train passenger and freight (principally transportation of containers, iron and steel, coal, \nand petroleum products) services is high. The investments will be part of the Government\u2019s \nrailway sector Investment Plan to be implemented over 7 years ending in FY2013. The total \nestimated cost of the Investment Plan is $887 million, of which $500 million will be financed by \nthe Investment Project. The Investment Project will finance improvement of signal systems and \nloop lines, rehabilitation of bridges, and procurement of rolling stock. This will be carried out \nusing four loans. Details of the Government\u2019s investment plan are in Supplementary Appendix \nD. \n \n25.  Reform Project. The Reform Project covers 2007\u20132010 and is part of the Government\u2019s \nSector  Roadmap.  The  reforms  and  actions  will  make  BR  more  market-oriented  through \nreorganization  by  LOB,  with  better  financial  governance  and  human  resource  governance \nsystems; transform it into a government-owned corporate entity; and improve rail safety. The \ntotal estimated cost for the Reform Project implementation is $37.5 million.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "8   \n  1.  Investment Project \n \n    a.  First Loan from Ordinary Capital Resources \n \n26.  One sample subproject was prepared for Board consideration. This is the doubling of \nTongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar down line (64 km) where the current utilization far exceeds capacity and \ntrain delays are common. This sample subproject was chosen as this section of the network has \nthe highest concentration of traffic and the most serious environmental and resettlement issues. \nThe  detailed  description  and  cost  estimates  of  the  sample  subproject  are  in  Appendix  5. \nPreparation  and  approval  of  additional  subprojects  will  be  undertaken  during  subproject \nimplementation in accordance with the criteria and approval procedures given in Appendix 6. \nThe first loan for $100 million in January 2007 will finance (i) consulting services for detailed \ndesign and construction supervision of the sample subproject, (ii) consulting services for other \nsubproject  preparation,  (iii)  consulting  services  for  detailed  design  of  other  approved \nsubprojects, (iv) consulting services for the rerating study of the Jamuna Bridge, (v) construction \nof the Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar double track, and (vi) procurement of rolling stock.  \n \n    b.  Second Loan from Ordinary Capital Resources \n \n27.  The second loan for $150 million in January 2008 will be contingent on agreed reform \nactions being implemented. It will finance (i) construction of other subprojects in the Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong corridor and Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridor studied under the first loan and that \nsatisfy the agreed subproject selection criteria in Appendix 6, and (ii) construction supervision \nconsulting services for the approved subprojects.  \n \n    c.  Third and Fourth Loans from Ordinary Capital Resources \n \n28.  The third loan for $100 million in January 2009 and fourth loan for $50 million in January \n2011 will be contingent on agreed reform actions being implemented. They will finance (i) \nconstruction of subprojects on other sections of the BR main line network from the Investment \nPlan that satisfy the agreed subproject selection criteria in Appendix 6, and (ii) construction \nsupervision consulting services for the approved subprojects.  \n \n  2.  Reform Project Using an Asian Development Fund Loan \n \n29.  The Reform Project will undertake implementation of sector reform and institutional \nstrengthening  actions  agreed  with  the  Government  and  BR  as  detailed  in  Appendix  7.  It \nencompasses (i) restructuring BR into an LOB structure; (ii) preparing an asset register for BR; \n(iii)  improving  financial  governance,  management,  and  accounting  systems;  (iv)  improving \nhuman resource governance and utilization; and (v) transforming BR into a government-owned \ncorporate entity, while enhancing the rail safety regulatory framework. The sector reform matrix \ngiving the detailed time-bound policy actions and reform measures to be undertaken by the \nGovernment and their linkages to loan approvals is summarized in Appendix 7. The detailed \nroad map to achieve these reforms is given in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n30.  The loan for the Reform Project is from Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources and \nwill finance (i) consulting services to implement the reform actions identified in para. 29; (ii) \nprocurement  of  computer  hardware  and  software  needed  to  implement  the  financial \nmanagement, accounting, and human resource management systems for enhancing financial \nand human resource governance; (iii) equipment to improve rail safety; and (iv) consulting \nservices for performance and procurement audits. Cost estimates for items to be financed from \n ", "  9\nthe  ADF  loan  are  provided  in  Appendix  8.  As  these  items  are  all  nonrevenue  generating \nexpenditures but are important for reform implementation and safety improvement, the use of \nADF resources to finance these items is considered justified.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n  1.  Linkage of Loan Approvals to Reform Achievement \n \n31.  The Investment Program is designed as a strategic integration of sector policy reforms, \ninstitutional development,  and  investment.  Investment  Program  loan  approvals  for  capacity \nimprovement  will  be  directly  linked  to  the  achievement  of  specific  reform  actions.  The \nGovernment has already undertaken the preparatory actions agreed with ADB as being needed \nto ensure that reform and investment implementation can start as soon as possible using the \nADF loan for $30 million and the first ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan for $100 million. \nApproval  of  the  second  OCR  loan  for  $150  million  will  be  dependent  on  the  successful \nachievement  of  seven  policy  and  institutional  reform  actions  including  completion  of  the \nreorganization of BR by LOB. Approval of the third OCR loan for $100 million, will be dependent \non  BR  successfully  implementing  11  policy  and  institutional  reform  actions.  These  include \nadoption  of  approved  financial  management  and  accounting  systems  to  improve  financial \ngovernance  and  a  human  resource  management  system  to  improve  human  resource \ngovernance. Approval of the fourth loan for $50 million will be dependent on the achievement of \n12 policy and institutional reform actions including transforming BR into a government-owned \ncorporate entity and establishing a rail safety regulatory body. A project agreement with the \ngovernment-owned BR corporate entity will be needed at that time.  \n \n  2.  Improving Sector and Corporate Governance \n \n32.  The design of the Reform Project incorporates measures to improve governance at three \nlevels, i.e., sector, corporate, and project. The reform elements are specifically designed to \nimprove sector and corporate governance of the railway sector. The introduction of modern \nfinancial management and accounting systems is to ensure that financial governance within BR \nis improved. The new system, which will be computer-based, will incorporate computerized \naudit trails to ensure that internal and external auditing and tracking will be up to internationally \naccepted standards. Audit trails will also improve transparency in tracking cash and financial \napprovals and decision-making from the station up to the corporate headquarters. The financial \nstatements produced using the new system will be based on internationally accepted practices \nfor the railway sector, and provide transparency and rationality to sector decision-making on \nfinancial issues such as tariff-setting and calculation of public service obligation payments. \nCorporate  governance  will  also  be  improved  with  the  introduction  of  human  resource \nmanagement  systems  under  the  reform  program.  Key  performance  indicators  will  be \nestablished for top management who will be held accountable for achieving the planned results. \nA more detailed analysis of how the Reform Project is designed to improve governance and its \nrelationship to other ADB initiatives being implemented to improve national governance as well \nas anticorruption measures at the project level is shown in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n  3.  Use of a Common Reform Program by Other Development Partners \n \n33.  The reform program outlined in Reform Project will also be used by the World Bank and \nJBIC. Hence it will form the basis for not just ADB intervention in the railway sector but also \nthose of the World Bank and JBIC in financing priority investments from the Government\u2019s \nInvestment Plan.  \n ", "10  \nD.

The Government has requested financing for up to an equivalent of $430,000,000, i.e., \nup to $400,000,000 from ADB\u2019s OCR and up to $30,000,000 equivalent from the ADF to help \nfinance the Investment Program. The financing will be provided under an MFF in accordance \nwith ADB policy.10 The MFF will extend five loans to finance a range of subprojects and reform \naction implementation under the Investment Program subject to submission of a related periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) by the Government and execution of the related loan agreements. The \nGovernment has entered into a framework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB. The FFA \nsatisfies the requirements set forth in Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities, Appendix 4 \n(footnote 11). The Government is required to comply with the FFA requirements. Pursuant to \nthe FFA, the Government has submitted to ADB the first PFR for two loans of (i) $30 million \nequivalent  from  ADF  resources  and  (ii)  $100  million  from  OCR  resources.  This  PFR  is \npresented to the Board with the FFA. The minimum amount of a loan request will be $30 million. \nAll of the provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations and Special Funds resources \napplicable to ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loans and ADF loans respectively will apply to each loan as \nappropriate, subject to modifications, if any, that may be included under any loan agreement. \nFor LIBOR-based loans, the Government has the option to choose between eligible currencies \nand the interest rate regime for each loan. The specific terms of each LIBOR-based loan will be \nbased on the related PFR with the interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2005.

The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The loan financed from ADF \nresources will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum during the amortization period; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as may be agreed upon. A project agreement will be entered \ninto with BR once it is transformed into a government-owned corporate entity. The MFF amount \nincludes $92.77 million for contingencies.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Investment Program Management \n36  BR will be the Executing Agency for the Program. Two implementation units have been \nestablished: (i) the Reform Implementation Unit (RIU) headed by a senior BR officer at the \nAdditional Director General level, who is the Reform Project Director and staffed by suitably \nqualified officers from the BR and Ministry of Communications (MOC), and (ii) the Project \nImplementation Unit (PIU) headed by a General Manager from BR who is Project Director for \nthe Investment Project. An interministerial committee co-chaired by the Secretary, MOC and the \nSecretary, Finance Division, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and  consisting of representatives from \nthe Economic Relations Division, MOF, the Ministry of Establishment, the Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice,  BR,  and  other  agencies  as  determined  by  the  Borrower,  has  been  established  to \noversee, monitor and provide the necessary policy guidance to both Project Directors. The \nDirector General, BR will report to the interministerial committee on a regular basis. BR has \nappointed  both  project  directors.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  shown  in \nSupplementary Appendix G.

The Program will be implemented over 84 months, including preconstruction activities. \nThe  scheduled  completion  date  for  the  Reform  Project  is  December  2010  and  for  the \nInvestment  Project  December  2013.  This  takes  into  account  advance  action  for  recruiting \ndetailed  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants  for  the  sample  and  nonsample \nsubprojects. The last date for PFR submission is 1 December 2011 and the last date for \ndisbursement is 31 December 2013. The proposed implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement  \n38.  The project directors will be responsible for all procurement activities. All contracts will \nuse international competitive bidding and be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines. For the sample subproject, two contracts (tracks and signaling) of civil works, supply \nand installation of equipment will be procured through the international competitive bidding \nprocedure. For the Reform Project, relevant computer hardware and software will be procured. \nIndicative contract packages for the Reform Project and sample subproject, including consulting \nservices, are shown in the respective procurement plans in Appendix 11. Contract packages for \nadditional nonsample subprojects will be decided during project implementation, based on the \napproach used for the sample subproject.  \n \n39.  International and national consulting services will assist BR to implement the reform and \ninvestment projects. The consultants financed under the loan will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. One consultancy contract financed under the \nloan will be necessary to help implement the Reform Project, i.e., (i) implementation of the BR \nrestructuring by LOB, (ii) preparation of a BR asset register, (iii) implementation of a financial \nand accounting system, (iv) BR human resources planning, and (iv) corporatization advisory \nservices.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  these  consulting  services  are  attached  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. Another consultancy contract will be required for (i) subproject \npreparation  and  appraisal,  (ii)  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision  of  the  sample \nsubproject, (iii) the rerating study of the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge to recommend measures \nto  increase  the  rail  loading  capacity  of  the  bridge,  and  (iv)  detailed  design  of  approved \nnonsample subprojects. Outline terms of reference for these consulting services under the \nsample  subproject  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I,  and  for  construction  supervision  for \nnonsample subprojects in Supplementary Appendix J. All consultants financed under the loan \nwill be selected and engaged using ADB's quality- and cost-based selection procedures for \nrecruiting firms under the full technical proposal. The Government asked ADB to carry out the \nselection of consultants as BR does not have the experience to evaluate consultants needed for \nsuch  a  complex  program  with  a  strong  reform  component  interlinked  with  the  investment \ncomponent. Once selected by ADB, the Government will negotiate with the selected consultants \nto finalize the consulting contracts and will retain the responsibility to supervise the consultants.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nRehabilitation Project (Summary Procedure).

Manila (Loan \n1561-BAN[SF]). \n ", " 13\n4.  Anticorruption Policy \n40.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy13 was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nBR. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  bidding \ndocuments. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program will \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nBR and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the \nProgram.  At  the  project  level,  several  measures  to  strengthen  governance  have  been \nincorporated, i.e., strong project supervision with adequate provision of consulting input, and \nperformance  and  financial  auditing  will  be  carried  out  during  project  implementation  by \ninternational private sector auditors. The auditors will also conduct random or spot audits for \nprocurement and contract implementation activities under the contracts. The terms of reference \nfor the performance and financial audit are given in Supplementary Appendix K. A more detailed \nanalysis  of  the  anticorruption  measures  at  the  project  level  is  provided  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F.  \n \n5  Disbursement Arrangements \n41.  For consulting services; procurement of equipment; and contracts of civil works, supply, \nand  installation,  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  using  direct  payment  and  reimbursement \nprocedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB. BR will open and maintain an \nimprest account for each loan with Bangladesh Bank. The amount in each imprest account will \nnot exceed 6 months payment or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. All expenditures \nin local currency not exceeding $100,000 equivalent per payment will be disbursed using the \nstatement of expenditure modality. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n42.  BR will submit detailed quarterly progress reports. BR will maintain separate records and \naccounts adequate to identify the goods and services financed from loan proceeds, financing \nresources received, expenditures incurred for the Program, and local funds. The accounts will \nbe set up in accordance with sound accounting principles. Consolidated project accounts and \nrelated financial statements will be audited annually by recognized auditors acceptable to ADB. \nThe auditors will be required to provide an opinion on BR\u2019s compliance with the Program\u2019s \nfinancial covenants. The audited reports and related financial statements will be submitted to \nADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The Financial \nAdvisor and Chief Accounts Officer in BR will coordinate all accounts and ensure compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s audit and accounting requirements, which will be followed up in regular reviews by \nADB. The program completion report should be prepared within 3 months after the physical \ncompletion of the Program  \n \n7.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n43.  The Government will ensure that within 6 months of the effective date of the first OCR \nloan, BR (i) develops a systematic project performance monitoring system, indicators, and \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. \n ", "14  \nanalysis for use throughout the life of the Program; and (ii) develops and conducts a quick and \neasy rapid sample survey to establish a baseline for subsequent performance monitoring. The \nmonitoring should be gender-disaggregated, where appropriate. Thereafter, evaluation surveys \nwill be conducted annually. The scope of the survey, quantity and quality of data, and frequency \nfor collection will be guided primarily by the project management\u2019s need for progressive rapid \nfeedback on implementation status, as well as early warning of impending situations that might \njeopardize attainment of the development objectives. The Government and BR will agree upon \nthe key indicators and assumptions that determine the required data for rapid assessment. \nSome key socioeconomic indicators are given in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n8.  Program Review \n44.  In addition to regular reviews including a midterm review for each loan by ADB staff, a \ndetailed midterm review of the Investment Program will identify any problems or weaknesses in \nimplementation arrangements, and agree on any changes needed to achieve the Program\u2019s \nobjectives. This midterm review will be conducted during the third year of implementation. \nTerms of reference for this review will be included in the facility administration memorandum to \nbe prepared by ADB\u2019s inception mission for the Investment Program. An information paper will \nbe presented annually to the Board on the progress of the Investment Program. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n45.  Advisory TA for $2,000,000 to will be provided for Institutional Support for Railway \nReforms. The TA will have three components. The first will be used to engage two advisers: one \ninternational for 12 person-months and one national for 17. Because the reform program is \ncomprehensive and will fundamentally transform how BR will be organized and operate in the \nfuture, BR management identified the need for expert advice to help BR evaluate the reform \nconsultants\u2019  proposals  and  recommendations.  The  advisers  will  also  provide  continuity  in \noverseeing Reform Project implementation should there be any change in BR top management \nbased on the Government\u2019s administrative norms and requirements.  \n \n46.  The second TA component will be to improve the operational efficiency of BR to make \noptimum use of the reform and investment components. This will enable BR to be more capable \nto  run  high-speed  train  operations  once  the  investment  projects  are  ready  for  use.  This \ncomponent will help BR improve its maintenance standards and practices for infrastructure, \nrolling stock, signaling, and telecommunications, as well as enhance rail safety. BR training \ncurriculum  and  manuals  will  be  modernized  as  part  of  this  component.  This  will  provide \nknowledge transfer, and more importantly institutionalize and internalize this knowledge transfer \nfor the future benefit of the railway sector in Bangladesh. The third component will be to conduct \nperformance  and  procurement  audits  to  assess  sector  and  procurement  governance, \nperformance and performance results. The TA will cover fielding of international and national \nconsultants to provide support for these three components. This TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. All consultants financed under the TA will be selected \nand engaged using ADB's quality- and cost-based selection procedures for recruiting firms \nunder the simplified technical proposal and biodata technical proposal as appropriate and ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for recruiting individual consultants. The outline terms of reference for this TA are in \nSupplementary Appendix K.  \n \n ", " 15\nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n47.  The Reform Project will enable BR to restructure itself into an LOB organizational structure \nwith distinct cost and profit centers, and improved financial governance and human resource \ngovernance. It will enable BR to have accurate asset registers, and modern financial accounting \nand management systems. This will enable BR to have greater commercial focus concentrating \non distinct markets as opposed to the current government departmental focus prevalent in BR. \nTransparency  and accurate information  will be provided for policy  and operational decision-\nmaking and service planning. Breaking away from a bureaucratic structure into a corporate \nstructure will introduce greater accountability to BR managers. With a greater commercial focus, \nBR losses could be reduced if not reversed and thus the burden on the Government to finance \nthese losses lessened. Improving BR\u2019s efficiency will also help to attract greater foreign direct \ninvestment into the country as an efficient transportation system is one of the factors that investors \nconsider. Rail reform is a prerequisite of potential investors in coal and steel projects (para. 20). \nHence the Reform Project will directly help Bangladesh to secure these two mega investment \nprojects. Furthermore as the ADB Private Sector Operations Department is considering being an \ninvestor in the steel project, restructuring BR by LOB is also directly creating business synergies \nand opportunities between ADB\u2019s public sector and its private sector operations. The Investment \nProject will finance infrastructure and rolling stock to alleviate capacity constraints. This will enable \nBR to carry more freight and passenger traffic while reducing the costs of transport for users, thus \ncontributing to economic growth and additional earnings for BR. This will in turn reduce the \nGovernment\u2019s subsidies provided to BR thus enabling the Government to devote more resources \nto other priority sectors. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n1.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n48.  The economic internal rate of return was calculated by comparing the with- and without-\nsubproject scenarios in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong rail corridor. The existing available rail corridor \nhas reached capacity and will be unable to carry additional goods and passenger traffic without \nthe subproject. With the subproject, the capacity of the rail corridor will be increased to be able \nto carry more goods and passenger traffic. \n \n49.  The subproject\u2019s economic costs include the resource costs for construction, rolling \nstock acquisition costs, operation and maintenance costs, and social costs arising from land \nacquisition and  resettlement  compensation.  The  main  economic  benefits  generated  by  the \nsubproject were quantified in terms of (i) railway operating cost savings arising from faster travel \ntimes for both goods and passenger services; (ii) savings in operating costs for both freight and \npassenger traffic arising from traffic diverted from road to rail made possible with the increase in \nrail capacity; (iii) savings in working capital loss for freight traffic arising from time savings, \nincluding elimination of waiting times to get slots on railways for the goods being transported; \nand (vi) time savings for passengers arising from faster train travel times. Other benefits such as \nsavings in avoided road maintenance costs arising from the reduction in laden trucks using the \nroad because the goods are being transported by railways; have not been considered in the \neconomic evaluation, thus making this analysis conservative. The economic internal rate of \nreturn is estimated to be 16%, indicating that the subproject is economically viable. Sensitivity \nand  risk  analysis  indicates  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  robust  under  most \n ", "16  \nconditions. The summary of the economic and financial analysis is given in Appendix 12 and the \nfull details in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n \n2.  Financial Internal Rate of Return  \n \n50.  The financial evaluation was completed for the subprojects required to complete double-\ntracking of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong rail corridor. The financial evaluation was undertaken in real \nterms using constant 2005 prices. The subproject cost estimates and financial projections in \nnominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and \ndomestic inflation and currency fluctuation. Incremental benefits and costs were derived by \nevaluating  the  financial  position  of  BR  under  with-  and  without-subproject  scenarios.  The \nfinancial internal rate of return, computed on an after-tax basis, is 14%. This compares favorably \nwith the average weighted average cost of capital of 5%, also computed on an after-tax basis. \nThe  subprojects  are  considered  both  financial  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  and  risk \nanalyses indicate that the financial internal rate of return is robust under most conditions. The \ndetailed financial evaluation is provided in Appendix 12, with further information provided in \nSupplementary Appendix L. The financial projections for BR are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \nC.  Social Impact \n  1.  Poverty and Social Dimensions \n \n51.  The Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor connects the two largest cities in Bangladesh: Dhaka, \nthe  capital  (district  population  8.6  million);  Chittagong,  Bangladesh\u2019s  main  port  (district \npopulation 6.6 million); and the other areas in between. Comilla (district population 5.0 million) is \nthe largest of the cities within the corridor. The total population in the corridor (broadly defined) \nis 38 million. The corridor has a land area that comprises only 16% of the area of Bangladesh, \nbut contains 30% of the population and accounts for 40% of the country\u2019s GDP. Expansion of \nrail capacity in the corridor would lead to increased freight and passenger services both for \npeople in this region as well as to other regions of the country thereby creating opportunities for \neconomic and social development that would lead to poverty reduction. As this subproject will \nprovide an efficient transport linkage from the port of Chittagong not only to Dhaka but also to \nthe rest of the rail network, the Project will facilitate growth of local markets and industries \nthereby creating more employment opportunities, with substantial opportunities being passed on \nto unskilled workers of the area.  \n52.  The  benefit  of  the  improved  rail  transportation  facilities  will  be  enjoyed  by \nconsigners/consignees  since  rail  freight  tariffs  are  lower  than  truck  charges  thereby  also \nreducing the cost of goods. With faster and more reliable services of passenger and intercity \ntrains, travelers will increase trip frequency for both business and other purposes, and this will \nincrease  labor  mobility.  The  subproject  will  also  reduce  poverty  by  providing  employment \nopportunities for local residents, especially the poor, during construction and operation. It will \nprovide increased business opportunities to the suppliers of goods and services to the railways \nand thus generate more employment opportunities. The improvement of the rail network will \nenable  the  people,  especially  the  poor  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  to  have  greater \naccessibility to other infrastructure services, for example schools, universities, and hospitals, as \nthe travel time will be decreased enabling them to reach such facilities more efficiently and on \ntime. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 13.  \n \n \n \n ", " 17\n  2.  Resettlement  \n \n53.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  for  the  sample  subproject  will  be \nsignificant. Most of the proposed improvement and construction work will be carried out within \navailable BR land. However, an estimated 16 hectares of land will have to be acquired for the \nconstruction of railway embankments and bridge approaches. A full census and a sample \nsocioeconomic survey conducted in June 2004 identified about 680 residential, commercial, \ncommunity structures within 18\u201322 meters right-of-way that will be affected by the subproject. \nAmong  the  affected  households,  228  will  lose  residential  structures  and  432  commercial \nstructures. In terms of ownership status of the households, 23 are encroachers, 23 occupiers, \n196 owners, 180 squatters, and 258 tenants.14 Overall the subproject will affect 3,619 people \nand an estimated 835 people in 150 households are likely to be affected by acquisition of \nagricultural land. Nearly 426 agricultural and 207 commercial licensees will also lose access to \nrailway-owned agricultural and commercial land. No indigenous people will be affected by the \nsubproject. The estimated cost of land acquisition and resettlement is approximately $3.34 \nmillion equivalent. The summary resettlement plan (Appendix 14) has been translated into \nBangla, disclosed to those affected, and will be posted in the BR and ADB websites. The \nsample subproject resettlement plan will be updated on completion of detailed design and be \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval. In compliance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s policy \non involuntary resettlement,15 a resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix N) will be \napplicable for the nonsample subprojects. Resettlement plans for these subprojects will be \nprepared based on detailed design and approved by BR, and submitted to ADB for approval.  \n \nD.  Environmental Impact \n54.  Transport, especially vehicle emission, is the highest contributor to Bangladesh\u2019s air \npollution problems. Improving the railway network will contribute significantly to reducing air \npollution associated with vehicle emission especially in Chittagong, Dhaka and Khulna. The \nother expected potential environmental impacts are related to improving access, which will lead \nto increasing uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources. However, the gradual improvement \nin enforcing the Environmental Conservation Act, 1995 is expected to minimize the potential \nuncontrolled  exploitation  of  natural  resources  and  the  environment.  Nonetheless, \nimplementation of the Investment Program has environmental consequences due to its physical \nintervention such as construction of railway networks.  \n \n55.  In this context, the Investment Project is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d project in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  2002.  The  initial  environmental  examination  of  the  sample \nsubproject systematically illustrates the potential environmental impacts, proposed mitigation \nmeasures, and how to implement the mitigation measures. The assessment of impacts at the \nsubproject level will become an integral part of managing the Investment Project. The initial \nenvironmental  examination  for  the  Tongi\u2013Bhairab  Bazar  (64  km)  section  (as  a  sample \nsubproject) shows that the environmental impacts associated with construction of additional \ntracks and formation of additional embankment, including bridge construction, are temporary \nand will occur only during construction. These impacts require mitigation measures that are \nmanageable  and  mostly  can  be  incorporated  into  construction  works. 16  Therefore,  the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan, which clearly describes the required mitigation \nmeasures,  will  be  incorporated  in  the  bidding  document  to  ensure  that  the  contractors \n                                                 \n14  Encroachers are landowners adjacent to BR land who have encroached into BR land. Squatters are those who \noccupy BR land without authorization and do not own any land adjacent to BR land.  \n15  ADB. 1995. Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n16 For example, establishment of slope stabilization, and culverts.  \n ", "18  \nimplement the mitigation measures properly. The plan provides overall guidance to address \nenvironmental impacts related to the sample  subproject. For the follow-up subprojects, an \nenvironmental assessment review framework was prepared to guide the impacts assessment \nprocedure.  The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental  assessment \nreview framework for additional subprojects are attached as Supplementary Appendix O.  \n \nE.  Risks \n56.  The  most  significant  risk  for  the  Program  is  that  the  reform  measures  will  not  be \nimplemented in full and therefore that improvements in sector performance will be less than \nexpected. This risk has been mitigated by linking reform and investment, whereby the key steps \nin the reform process are conditions for approvals of subsequent batches of subprojects, thus \ngiving an incentive to BR to implement the reforms. The sequencing of the reforms has been \ncarefully designed so that they are implemented in incremental irreversible steps to discourage \nany backsliding. Instead of transforming BR into a government-owned corporate entity in one \nsingle step, the internal reorganization is implemented first, together with putting into place the \nappropriate financial and human resource governance systems. Once visible success in the \nform of greater financial and operational performance is achieved in these initial steps, the \nreform  process  will  gain  added  credibility,  which  will  discourage  backsliding,  and  thus  the \ntransformation of BR into a government-owned corporate entity can be achieved more easily.  \n \n57.  Linking investment subproject approvals to achievement of reform actions carries the \nrisk  that  investment  subprojects  will  be  delayed  because  the  relevant  reform  actions  are \nimplemented late. This risk has been mitigated by preparing a realistic reform road map that \ngives a buffer period between when a particular reform action will be fully implemented and a \ndeadline when that reform action is due to enable submission of a PFR for an investment \ncomponent loan.  \n \n58.  On the investment side, the main risk for the Program is that implementation will be \ndelayed, especially initially as the PIU gets accustomed to its working arrangements. This risk is \nconsidered slight as the project completion report for the Jamuna Bridge Railway Link Project \nshowed that BR has good project management and implementation capacity. This risk has been \nfurther  mitigated  with  the  Government  asking  ADB  to  carry  out  the  selection  for  both  the \nconsulting contracts to prepare the civil works contracts and the reform implementation to be \nfinanced under the Program so that no bureaucratic delays occur in this initial period before the \nPIU is functioning at optimum efficiency. The Government has also agreed that FIDIC conditions \nwill be used so that the construction supervision consultant as \u201cEngineer\u201d in the contract will \nhave sufficient authority to direct the contractors. On the whole, the integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs, given the likelihood of risks occurring.  \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n59.  The Government, MOC, and BR are committed to the reforms set forth in the sector road \nmap. Assurances relating to implementation of the Reform Project are in the FFA. In addition to \nthe standard assurances, highlights of the Reform Project and anticorruption assurances agreed \nto by the Government and Bangladesh Railway include \n \n ", " 19\n(i)  Within  12  months  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  first  loan:  complete  the \nreorganization of BR by line of business (LOB); develop an agreed 5-year business plan \nfor  each  LOB  and  BR;  develop  key  performance  indicators  (KPI);  develop  an \narchitecture/model for a new accounting and financial management system; identify \npersonnel requirements and positions for experts that need to be filled by recruitment \nfrom outside BR if such skills are not available within BR.  \n \n(ii)  Within 24 months of the effectiveness of the first loan: complete BR\u2019s asset \nregistry; develop an outsourcing/divestiture plan for non-core services; produce financial \nmanagement and accounting statements; implement a mechanism for public service \nobligation (PSO) subsidies; implement a new internal pricing structure; redefine job \ndescriptions, and career advancement processes; of the different staff grades; recruit \nexperts with needed skills from outside BR as and where necessary; formulate improved \nstandards  for  maintenance  of  permanent  way,  rolling  stock  and  signaling  systems; \nimprove operating practices to reduce journey times in Dhaka-Chittagong corridor; and \nupdate all relevant BR operations and maintenance manuals. \n \n  (iii)  Within  48  months  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  first  loan:  complete  the \ndivestiture/outsourcing  of  all  non-core  services;  implement  a  new  tariff  structure; \nformulate a new market-based financial remuneration structure for all BR employees and \nperformance-based  incentive  structure  and  accountability  measures  for  key  BR \nmanagement personnel; prepare options based on principle that staff will be no worse \noff for BR personnel to transfer to government owned corporate entity; approve social \nsafety net for BR staff, if any, who, when BR is transformed into a government owned \ncorporate entity become redundant; approve the form and legal status of transforming \nBR into a government-owned corporate entity including the division and transfer of \nassets and liabilities; approve technical and safety regulatory framework for rail sector; \nenact and promulgate legislation required for the transformation of BR into a government \nowned corporate entity; formally establish BR as a government owned corporate entity \nwith its own assets and liabilities and establish the safety and technical regulatory body \nfor the rail sector within 48 months of effectiveness of the first loan. \n \n60.  Land  and  Resettlement.  BR will ensure that land acquisition and resettlement are \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples. The sample subproject resettlement plan will be updated on completion of \ndetailed design and will be submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to award of civil \nworks contract. In case of any discrepancies between the Government\u2019s laws, regulations, \nand/or procedures and ADB\u2019s requirements, ADB\u2019s Policy will apply.  \n \n61.  Environment. BR will ensure that the Investment Program, each subproject, and all \nproject facilities are developed, conducted, implemented, and maintained in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s Environmental Conservation Act 1995, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). In \ncase of any discrepancies between the Government\u2019s laws, regulations, and/or procedures, and \nADB\u2019s requirements, ADB\u2019s policy will apply. In addition, BR will ensure that the environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan will be strictly implemented. BR and ADB will review the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan for each loan prior to processing the follow-up \nloans.  \n \n62.  Social  Development  and  Gender  Issues.  BR  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works \ncontractors comply with all applicable labor laws, use their best efforts to employ women and \nlocal people living in the vicinity of the subprojects and disseminate information at worksites on \n ", "20  \nthe risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for those employed during construction. \nBR will require contractors not to differentiate between men and women\u2019s wages and benefits \nfor work of equal value. Contracts for all subprojects will include specific clauses on these \nundertakings, and compliance will be strictly monitored by BR during project implementation. \n \n63.  PFR and Subproject Approval Process and Selection. All subprojects will comply \nwith  ADB  policies,  procedures,  and  relevant  guidelines,  and  satisfy  ADB  procedures  for \nsubproject preparation. Approval of the second and subsequent PFR is contingent on the reform \nactions specified for each PFR being fulfilled and the specified subproject selection criteria \nbeing fulfilled.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n64.

Introduction \n \n1.  Privately owned regional railways were built in what is now Bangladesh during colonial \ntimes to support commerce and passenger movements.1 These were gradually taken over by \nthe Government, with the nationalization process being completed by 1942. After independence \nin 1947, control of railways falling within the boundaries of what is now Bangladesh was with the \ncentral government of Pakistan. A Railway Board was formed in 1962 and management of the \nrailways  was  placed  under  the  then  East  Pakistan  provincial  government.  With  the \nindependence of Bangladesh, the railways were renamed Bangladesh Railway (BR).  \n \n2.  BR, a department under the Ministry of Communications, has a network of 2,855 route-\nkilometers (km) and 34,168 regular employees. It is headed by a Director General who is \nassisted by five Additional Director Generals, one Rector of the Training Academy, one Chief \nPlanning Officer, and seven Joint Director Generals. The network is divided into two zones: the \neast and west, separated by the Jamuna River. Each zone is headed by a General Manager \nwho is responsible to the director general. Each zone is in turn divided into two geographic \ndivisions,  which  form  the  basic  unit  of  operation.  The  BR  Director  General  reports  to  the \nSecretary of the Ministry of Communications and thereafter to the Minister of Communications. \nThe nine-member Bangladesh Railway Authority headed by the Minister of Communications \nprovides policy guidance. Supplementary Appendix A provides BR\u2019s organization chart. \n \n3.  The rail network comprises two gauges, including 660 km of broad gauge, i.e., 1.676 \nmeter width track, in the West Zone. In addition, the West Zone has 553 km of meter gauge, \ni.e., 1.0 meter width track, and the East Zone has 1,277 km of meter gauge track. At present, \nthe meter gauge networks of the two zones are linked by railway ferry crossing over the Jamuna \nRiver between Bhahadurabad and Fulchari (Balashi) Ghat at the upper section. In addition the \nnetwork has 365 km of dual gauge track (catering for both broad and meter gauge trains). The \nJamuna Multipurpose Bridge, which has a dual gauge railway link, provides the only east\u2013west \nrail link. However, its utility to BR is limited by the significant load restrictions placed on broad \ngauge trains crossing the bridge. BR has a total of 454 stations, 243 in the east and 211 in west \nzones. It has 277 locomotives, 1,407 passenger and other coaches, and 10,631 wagons. \n \nB.  Sector Performance \n \n  1.  Traffic \n \n4.  BR operates a mix of passenger and freight services. Railway freight is measured in ton-\nkm and passenger traffic in passenger-km. Overall, rail traffic is measured in converted ton-km. \nOver the last three decades, BR\u2019s share of the transport market has fallen due to increasing \ncompetition from road transport. In fiscal year (FY) 1974, BR had 28% market share of freight \ntraffic and 30% share of the passenger market. By FY2005, this had fallen to 7% for freight and \n13% for passenger traffic.  \n \n5.  Passenger  services  are  dominant,  accounting  for  over  83%  of  all  train  services. \nPassenger traffic rose steadily until FY1983 when it reached a peak of 106 million passengers; \nby FY 2005, it had declining to about 40 million passengers. Passenger-km also declined, \n                                                 \n1  The first railway line constructed in Bangladesh was the 53.11 km line between Darsana and Jagati in Kushtia \ndistrict by the Eastern Bengal Railway.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nalthough to a lesser extent, reflecting an increase in journey length from 60 km in 1983 to 100 \nkm in FY2005. Passenger operations are divided into three types of services\u2014intercity trains, \nmail/express trains, and local passenger trains. Intercity train services were introduced in 1985. \nDuring FY2005, about 40% of all passengers traveled on intercity trains, 37% on mail/express \ntrains, and the remaining 23% on local passenger trains. Taken as a whole, BR\u2019s passenger \nservices are unprofitable, with intercity trains being a notable exception. Revenue from intercity \ntrains accounts for 73% of total passenger earnings.  \n \n6.  BR  faces  tough  competition  with  other  transport  modes  for  high  value  cargo.  The \nimportance of freight operations on BR is highlighted by the fact that while accounting for  \nslightly less than 17% of total traffic units, their contribution to gross revenues in FY2005 was \nnearly 34%. Freight traffic was 3.2 million tons in FY1983, fell to 2.6 million tons in FY1995, but \nhas picked up thereafter, and during FY2005 was 3.2 million tons. BR\u2019s core business in freight \nrevolves around five commodities: food grains, containers, petroleum products, fertilizer, and \nstones, which together make up about 72% of total freight traffic. Container services were \nintroduced in 1991 and container traffic between Dhaka and Chittagong represent an important \ngrowth potential.

Operational Performance \n \n7.  The efficiency of a railway is measured by the productivity of its track, rolling stock, and \npersonnel.

Best Practices for Private Sector Investment in Railways.  \n \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \n8.  BR\u2019s track utilization and productivity data do not compare favorably with those of the \nother railways (Table A2.2). BR has several acute physical, infrastructure, operational, and \ninstitutional inefficiencies. The physical environment, with rivers subject to periodic flooding and \nrunning from north to south, poses considerable challenges to land transport, particularly for \neast\u2013west movement. The haul lengths available in many of the origin-destination pairs in the \nabsence of sufficient bridging are not competitive with the road system. The Jamuna River \nvirtually splits the country and the BR system. While the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge provides \nthe only east\u2013west link, its utility to BR is limited by significant load restrictions placed on broad \ngauge trains across the bridge. The situation has been exacerbated by the severe shortage of \ncapacity on some critical sections of the network, especially the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor, \narising from lack of investment. Table A2.3 shows capacities and operating results of some \ncritical sections of the BR network.  \n \nTable A2.3: Current Capacity of Critical Sections of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \nCorridor (number of trains both ways) \n \nSection  Gauge  Inter  Mail/  Local  Freight  Total  Capacity  Utilization  Traffic\nand  city  Express  (%)  Growth \nDistance  (%) \n(km) \nDhaka Tongi  MG-23  18  18  4  6  46  88  52  3.4 \n \nTongi  MG-64  18  18  12  10  58  50  116  3.4 \nBhairabbazar \nAkhaura-  MG-71  14  10  4  10  38  36  105  6.6 \nLaksam \nLaksam  MG-61  14  10  4  10  38  36  105  6.6 \nChinkiastana \nkm = kilometers, MG = meter gauge.  \nSource: Bangladesh Railway estimates. \n \n9.  The capacity constraints are also seen in the low and decreasing average train speeds. \nThe average speed of a goods train on broad gauge in FY1970 was 17.2 kilometers per hour \n(kph). This decreased to 11.1 kph in FY2005. In the case of goods trains on meter gauge, the \nspeed  was  13.6  kph  in  FY1970  and  12.2  kph  in  FY2005.  Another  major  source  of  BR \noperational constraints is poor maintenance practices. The BR locomotive fleet is historically \nunderutilized as a consequence of BR adopting a very conservative operational policy and \nsending  locomotives  to  the  shed  after  each  trip.  BR  maintains  its  track  manually.  The \nBangladesh Railway Way and Works Manual, compiled in 1958, provides for only manual \nmaintenance on old type tracks. This method of maintenance requires changes in view of \nmodern track structure that permits higher speeds and the need for tight track maintenance \ntolerances that higher speeds demand. BR has a large number of wagons fitted with roller \nbearings, which are scattered in the system. When mixed with ordinary wagons their usefulness \nis restricted. Theft of railway rolling stock parts, e.g., brake systems, complicates an already \nunsustainable rolling stock utilization system.  \n \n10.  A further operational problem is the number of accidents, especially derailments, on BR. \nFrom January to April 2005, the system had a total of 310 derailments, including main lines, \nbranch lines, and yards. This compares with a total of 220 derailments for the same period in \n2004, i.e., an increase of 3% in 2005 compared with 2004. Although these derailments did not \nresult in fatalities or injuries, they do cause delays in train operations and availability, and point \nto the need to improve BR\u2019s operation and maintenance practices. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n  3.  Tariffs \n \n11.  Since BR has been tasked to meet social as well as economic objectives, social and \npolitical factors have often outweighed commercial considerations in the process of tariff setting. \nAs  a  result,  passenger  services  have  been  underpriced  and  cross-subsidized  by  freight \nservices. As the national carrier, BR has the obligation to carry essential commodities like food \ngrains, fertilizer, jute, cement, coal, iron and steel, stone and boulders, petroleum products, salt, \nand sugar to remote areas at a cheaper rate. Compared with other countries, the ratio of BR\u2019s \naverage passenger fare per passenger-km to average freight tariff per ton-km is very low. The \nratio for Bangladesh is 0.5 compared with 1.2 for the People\u2019s Republic of China, 22.0 for \nJapan,  and  0.7  for  Thailand.  Passenger  services  account  for  83%  of  BR\u2019s  services  but \ncontribute only 58% of gross revenues.  \n \nC.  Challenges \n \n12.  Institutionally, BR\u2019s main problem is linked to its civil service department status, which \nhas limited its managerial and operational autonomy considerably while exacerbating its lack of \ncommercial and marketing orientation. It is therefore not in a position to take rapid business \ndecisions to focus on market segments where rail has a comparative advantage over other \nmodes. Decisions such as tariffs to be charged, staff deployment, abandonment of unprofitable \npassenger lines, and all major investment decisions have to be referred to the Government \nunder normal service rules and practices. The delays inherent in such a process have often \nmeant loss of business opportunities. \n \n13.  BR has reached a critical juncture in its performance and is close to a cycle of decline \nexperienced by many other countries\u2019 railway services, i.e., lower revenue leading to a lack of \nmaintenance and investment, resulting in poor services and contributing to reduced revenue. \nWhile railways worldwide face increasing competition from road, air, and water transport, BR \nfaces additional challenges in overcoming its lack of commercial focus, low efficiency, poor \nservice quality, political interference, aging fleet, and congested network on major corridors \nsuch as Dhaka\u2013Chittagong. The weaknesses in the railway sector are manifested in declining \nmarket share, adverse operating indicators, and reduced revenue generation. Their underlying \ncauses are to be found in the policy, institutional, and organizational arrangements for the \nrailways, which are based on the idea of running railways as a social and economic arm of the \nGovernment rather than as a business. A cause-effect tree analysis is shown in Supplementary \nAppendix B. However railways have the potential to be an efficient form of transport for certain \ncritical market segments. A balanced transport system whereby railways can achieve their \npotential in market segments where they are economically and financially competitive will help \nin the economic growth of the country and ensure that the investment already made in the \nsystem can be utilized efficiently.  \n \n14.  The future performance of BR will depend on how effectively it can adapt its services to \nits changing market position. The fundamental challenges for BR are therefore to establish a \ncommercial orientation with a view to (i) arresting the decline in its share of the main market \nsegments; (ii) improving the profitability of its operations; and (iii) generating sufficient income to \nfinance necessary investments in selective capacity expansion, asset replacement, operational \nimprovements, and safety. This will involve BR (i) operating railway services along business \nlines; (ii) concentrating on core businesses; and (iii) prioritizing investments based on financial \nand economic returns with a view to improving operational performance and capacity in major \npotential markets, e.g., Dhaka\u2013Chittagong. Another potentially profitable route for BR is the \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nDhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridor, which could attract traffic of 10 million tons by 2010 and 15 \nmillion tons if planned foreign direct investment in coal mines and steel plants materializes.\n ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE RAILWAY SUBSECTOR \n1974\u20132006 \n \nSource  Project  Amount  Year of \n($ million  Approval \nequivalent) \nADB  Railway Project  23   1974\n  Second Railway Project  46   1984\n  Flood Damage Restoration (railway component)  18  1988\n  Second Flood Damage Restoration   32  1989\n       (railway component)   \n  Railway Recovery Program  80  1994\n  Jamuna Bridge Railway Link Project  110  1997\n  Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation (railway  20  2005\n  component)   \n     \n     \nCanada  Various assistance  29  1971\u20131977\n  Rail I  44  1984\n  Rail II  73  1987\n     \n     \nFrance  Supply of three relief cranes  6.4  1991\n  Track equipment  1.4  1995\n  Jamuna Bridge Railway Link Project  8.0  1997\n     \n     \nGermany  Supply of locomotives    1995\n  Repair of passenger coaches   \n     \n     \nNorway  Supply of telecommunications equipment  28.4  1985\n     \n     \nOPEC  Jamuna Bridge Railway Link Project  15.0  1997\n     \n     \nSaudi  Construction of railway workshop at Saidpur    1991\nArabia     \n     \n     \nSpain  Jamuna Bridge Railway Link Project  11.4  1997\nADB = Asian Development Bank, OPEC = Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \nSource: Bangladesh Railway. \n \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \n \nROADMAP AND INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Sector Objectives \n \n1.  The Government, in its National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (NSARP), \nidentified development of the railway sector as important for poverty reduction because railways \nplay  a  key  role  in  accelerating  economic  growth  through  reduction  of  transport  costs  and \nimproving  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  for  foreign  and  domestic  direct  investment.

To  this  end  the \nGovernment has adopted the following policies for the railway sector that will be the guiding \nprinciples for both reform and investment requirements.  \n \n1.  Improvement of Institutional Capability of Bangladesh Railway \n \n3.  The priorities for modernizing the organization and structure of Bangladesh Railway are: \n \n(i)  convert BR to an entity with a greater commercial focus; \n(ii)  gradually separate BR\u2019s infrastructure from its operations and pave the way for \nincreased private sector involvement through leasing or concessions; and \n(iii)  introduction of improved accounting systems. \n \n4.  BR  will  be  transformed  into  a  government  owned  corporate  entity  with  a  greater \nautonomy enabling it to function independently on a commercial basis and allow private sector \nparticipation in the conduct of its business as well as to invest in the railway sector. There will \nbe transparency in public service obligations (PSO) compensation. Greater autonomy will be \ngiven to BR including stronger links with the private sector for services, staffing, tariff setting and \nnew developments. All assets and liabilities of BR will be assumed by the new government \n ", "  Appendix 4  31 \nowned  corporate  entity.  Making  the  railway  more  responsive  to  market  needs  through \norganizational reform, incorporating structural changes and sound business practices, has been \nidentified in the NSARP as an important factor in the country\u2019s poverty reduction efforts.  \n \n2.  Enhance the Operational Capacity of BR \n \n5.  BR will publish service plans to make the best use of the new Jamuna Bridge linking the \neast and west regions of the country. BR will acquire new rolling stock to make best use of the \nopportunities created  as a result of construction of the Jamuna Bridge. Operations on the rural \nbranch and low revenue passenger services, such as local and mail trains, will be reviewed.  \nWhere these are little used, BR will prepare techniques for attracting more passengers and \nenhancing    revenues.  Closure  of  the  services  which  are  unable  to  meet  their  expenses, \nalternative modes of operation, subsidy payments, and closure of loss incurring services will be \nconsidered.  In cases of social need and economic benefit the government will consider subsidy \npayments, i.e., PSO, to BR to maintain operations. This is in line with the NSARP objective of \nestablishing a more poor-friendly railway communication system in the country without at the \nsame time burdening the BR. Improvement in the operational performance of the railway \nsector has been identified as being necessary to achieve the NSARP objectives so that \nthere  is  a  balanced  development  of  all  transport  modes,  considering  that  further  road \ndevelopment is problematic in light of the  scarcity of land in the country.  \n \n3.  Obtain a Greater Share of the Freight Market \n \n6.  The Government will review BR tariffs regarding freight traffic, so that tariffs can be \nnegotiated to maximize market share. BR will also be asked to examine the possibility of \noperating inter-city freight services to fixed timetables, and to establish a joint working team with \nBangladesh Road Transport Corporation and private sector partners with a view to offering \nintegrated (multi-modal) rail/road services for freight. Accordingly, BR will look at increasing the \nnumber of container terminals. New terminals in cities outside Dhaka, as well as at Tongi, will \nbe studied. International links will be encouraged where they are in the greater interest of \nBangladesh to attract rail freight traffic. The NSARP identifies linking BR with the railways of \nneighboring countries through strategic partnership to have a high potential for encouraging \nBangladesh\u2019s economic growth, and poverty reduction while at the same time enhancing the \ncommercial viability of the railway sector. \n \n4.  Improve Financial Efficiency \n \n7.  The Government will not generally regulate passenger and freight fares. But in cases \nwhere BR is not allowed to increase the fare, the Government will pay a subsidy to make up the \nloss to BR. Investments will be made in work programs which will help improve efficiency and \nincrease profit. In order to attract a subsidy, BR must detail costs and revenues from individual \nlines and services.  The Government will seek to reach agreements with BR regarding the \nappropriate quality and service level for each line.  The Government will then be in a position to \nmake judgments concerning subsidy, against its own social and economic objectives. Subsidies \nwill be reviewed annually against these objectives, and the Government will introduce targets \nand accountability mechanisms to improve services and reduce future subsidy payments.  The \nprivate sector will be invited to compete to operate subsidized services. \n \n \n \n \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \n5.  Efficient Provision and Management of Railway Infrastructure \n \n8.  BR will prepare a plan for upgrading on a route basis, stressing the financial benefits of \nproposals. An investigation into reliability of the older signaling systems, including replacing the \nold signaling system where necessary, will be included in the plan. In terms of operations, BR \nwill introduce better systems for planning and using rolling stock.  The priority call on better \nquality stock should be in the profitable inter-city and freight sectors. The Government will \nencourage investment in additional and extended international rail infrastructure where there are \nclear economic benefits to Bangladesh. BR will introduce a program for fitting vacuum-braking \nto freight wagons, so that they can be used more efficiently, and a scrapping policy for unused \nlocomotives, coaches and wagons will be developed. Development of the railway sector has \nbeen identified in the NSARP as being necessary to encourage an environmentally-friendly \ntransport mode.  \n \n9.  The Government will play its part in promoting the role of the railway in the transport \nsystem  of  Bangladesh.  For  mass  public  transport  services  for  Dhaka,  the  possibility  of \nimplementing new rail commuter services  between Tongi and Narayanganj, via Dhaka (and \nother such mass public services) will be assessed by a detailed study. Further mass transit \nproposals for Dhaka can be considered once the financial position of BR is more robust.  \n \n6.  Reduce Involvement in Nonrail Activities \n \n10.  The Government will explore with BR the most efficient uses of BR\u2019s land assets (for \nexample, in joint ventures with the private sector) and invest the income to provide efficiency \nimprovements. The Government will seek to place hospitals and schools, currently owned and \noperated by BR, under the appropriate ministries.  BR should continue to maintain limited \nmedical facilities which have a railway specialty. \n \n7.  Improvement of Railway Safety \n \n11.  The Government Inspector of Bangladesh Railway (GIBR) office will be given greater \npowers in respect of safety on the railways.  In particular, it will be asked to investigate and \nrecommend operational plans to improve safety, and to halt practices which cause unsafe \noperations.  The Government will fund safety improvements in the railway. This will help BR \nachieve  safety  standards  and  records  on  par  with  international    safety  standards.    The \nGovernment will ensure that in the future all authorized crossings on national and regional roads \nare staffed, and that all staffed crossings have a means of communication to the nearest \nstations on each side. Automatic warning signals will also be installed on main roads when the \ntrain frequency rises above threshold levels. The Government will initiate a program of flyover \nconstruction at the busiest level crossings, with priority on economic merit.  New national roads \nwill in future be grade-separated from railways. The Government will campaign to educate the \npublic on the dangers of crossing railways, and to obey crossing gates. The Government will \nconsider a program for more efficient crossing operations in the light of more intensive train \noperations in greater Dhaka.  This will include consideration of flyovers. New roads which cross \nrailway tracks will be required to contain funding proposals for adequate and safe crossing \nfacilities in line with the above.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  33 \n8.  Encourage Greater Private Sector Participation in the Provision of Services \n \n12.  Enhancement of services for passengers and freight and for promoting growth in the use \nof the network, serving the community, benefiting the environment and getting good value for \ntaxpayer\u2019s money, with private sector participation will be encouraged. The Government will \nwelcome participation of the private sector in achieving these aims. The private sector will be \nencouraged to take a part in (i) ticketing, ticket allocation and seat reservations (ii) operation of \nall types of passenger services (iii) supply of rolling stock (iv) freight operations (v) rolling stock \nmaintenance and (vi) track maintenance. Outsourcing such activities to the private sector has \nbeen identified in the NSARP as being important to reduce public sector expenditure on the \nrailways.  \n \nC.  Reform Project of Investment Program \n \n13.  The Reform Project of the Investment Program aims to improve the performance of the \nrailway sector by implementing a program of organizational and policy reforms The Reform \nProject is in line with the sector policies outlined above and will cover the period 2007-2011. The \ndetails of the Reform Project are outlined in the paragraphs below and summarized in Table \nA4.2 below.  \n \n14.

Details of Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar Track Doubling and Signal Improvements \n \n1.  The Dhaka\u2013Chittagong track includes 196 kilometers (km) that are not doubled-tracked. \nThe sample subproject is the double tracking of Tongi-Bhairab Bazar down line (64 km) where \nthe current utilization far exceeds capacity and train delays are common. Keeping in view the \nneed to cater for possible future change over to meter gauge heavy haul or broad gauge, the \nconstructions standard recommended is for broad gauge main line. Provision for improvement \nto signaling systems and loop lines is included. \n \n2.  The Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar section has high embankments of over 3.66 meters in places, \nand 11 large bridges (including Bridge No 79- Sitalakhya 1x76.2 meters +4x30.5 meters+8x18.3 \nmeters) on deep foundations. The rivers are navigable and considerable planning skills are \nneeded  to  build  the  foundation  and  erect  the  superstructure,  including  consideration  of \ntemporary islanding. The major bridges will be located at least 30.5 meters away from the \nexisting bridges. \n \n3.  The sample subproject will help strengthen the core business activities of Bangladesh \nRailway (BR) by enhancing capacity to overcome constraints to increasing rail services in the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  where  demand  for  intercity  passenger  and  freight  (principally \ncontainer and petroleum products) services is high. \n \n4.  The maximum train speed in the design is same as the existing maximum train speed of \n72 km/hour on meter gauge and 80 km/hour on broad gauge. BR\u2019s existing meter gauge rolling \nstock is operable at a maximum speed of 72 km/hr. The current BR standards for construction \nand operation are recommended with the proviso that within 5 years of opening of the double-\ntracked  line,  BR  should  decide  upon  rational  construction,  maintenance,  and  operational \nguidelines  for  high-speed  operation.  Field  trials  as  necessary  should  be  conducted  in  a \nmethodical manner. The design standards for the sample subproject are outlined here: \n \n(i)  Embankment. The new meter gauge embankment will be built to take future \nbroad gauge loading. The embankment construction will rely on a 20% mix of \nborrow pit soil and 80% from outside BR land. Embankments up to a height of \n1.83 meters will have a 0.61 meter sand cushion and those above, 2 layers of \n0.61 meters  sand cushion. \n(ii)  Track. 40 A (kilograms/meter) new rails will be used for all running lines; similar \nsecond-hand rails will be used for the sidings and yards. Rail welding will be \napplied for converting the 14 meter shipping length of rails to 3-rail or 5-rail \npanels within stations yards and on major bridges; and the balance joints will be \ncontinuously welded. Ballast cushion will be 22 centimeters (cm) crushed stone \nover 42 cm subballast for meter gauge and 30 cm crushed stone over 42 cm sub \nballast for broad gauge. Sleepers will be prestressed concrete with clip type \nelastic  fastenings  similar  to  Pandorol  clips.  Wooden  (durable  or  treated \nnondurable) sleepers provided with bearing plates and elastic fastenings will be \nused on girder bridges. \n(iii)  Bridges. Minor bridges will be prestressed concrete for spans up to 6.1 meters \nreinforced concrete slabs for smaller spans and reinforced concrete pipes for \nculverts. For all other spans (major bridges), steel girders will be used with \nstringers placed for meter gauge rail. broad gauge maximum loading standards \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \nwill be used for girder design and fabrication, substructure, and foundation. BR's \nstandard designs of steel girders will be followed. \n(iv)  Signaling  and  Telecommunications.  The  existing  relay-based  signaling \nsystems in the section, which are operated by the stationmasters from stand-\nalone an operating control panel at each station, will be replaced by a modern \ncomputer-based system with provision for remote control of station signaling as \nwell  as  level  crossing  protection  system.  Optical  fiber  will  be  installed  for \ntransmission of voice and safety critical data for interstation block control and \nlevel crossing protection. \n \nB.  Cost Estimates \n \n5.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  selection  of  subprojects  by  Bangladesh  Railway  (BR)  will  be  subject  to  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approval. The criteria for selection of subprojects and the approval \nprocess follows. \n \nB.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n \n2.  Periodic Financing Request (PRF). Subprojects will be submitted in four PFRs. The \nfirst  will  contain  subprojects,  procurement,  and  consulting  services  with  maximum  ADB \nfinancing of $100 million, the second batch with maximum ADB financing of $150 million in \naddition to any unutilized/unrequested amount remaining from the 1st PFR, the third PFR with \nmaximum ADB financing of $100 million in addition to any unutilized/unrequested amount from \nthe 1st and 2nd PFR, and the last PFR with maximum ADB financing of $50 million in addition \nto any unutilized/unrequested amount from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd PFR. Each PFR will be \nsubmitted for ADB approval only after the corresponding reform actions that form a prerequisite \nfor the approval of a particular batch as stated in Appendix 7 have been met.  \n \n3.  Railway Investment Plan. The subproject will be part of the railway investment plan \nthat supports the core business of BR as identified in the medium-term reform program and in \nthe case of infrastructure projects forms part of BR\u2019s main infrastructure network.  \n \n4.  Technical Feasibility. The subproject will be technically feasible and a detailed report \nprepared. \n \n5.  Economic  and  Financial  Feasibility.  Economic  analysis  of  subprojects  will  be \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and the \nestimated economic internal rate of return will be at least 12%. Financial analysis will be \nconducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management \nof Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank to obtain the financial internal \nrate of return; it should exceed the weighted average cost of capital.  \n \n6.  Social  Assessment  and  Analysis.  The  subproject  will  be  socially  sound  and  will \nminimize the need for land acquisition and include measures to mitigate any social impacts. An \ninitial social assessment for the subproject will have been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nrelevant guidelines.  \n \n7.  Resettlement.  The  subproject  will  minimize  any  involuntary  resettlement1 or  land \nacquisition, or will have minimal impact on any people affected by land acquisition or their \nlivelihood.  The  subproject  design  will  explore  all  options  to  avoid  and/or  minimize  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  If  a  subproject  involves  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement, a full resettlement plan2 (or short resettlement plan)3 acceptable to ADB will have \n                                                 \n1  Involuntary resettlement addresses social and economic impacts that are permanent or temporary and are (i) \ncaused by acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) by change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed \non land as a result of an ADB operation. An affected person is one who experiences such impacts. \n2  Resettlement is significant when 200 or more people experience major impacts. Major impacts are defined as \ninvolving people being physically displaced from housing and/or having 10% or more of their productive, income \ngenerating assets lost.  \n3  Involuntary resettlement impacts that are not deemed significant require a short resettlement plan.  \n ", "42  Appendix 6 \nbeen prepared in accordance with the resettlement framework agreed between the Government \nand ADB and in accordance ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.4 \n \n8.  Indigenous Peoples. If any indigenous people, such as tribes or settlers, as per ADB\u2019s \ndefinition, are likely to be affected significantly by a subproject, an indigenous peoples\u2019 plan \nshould be prepared in accordance with ADB's policy on indigenous peoples.5 \n \n9.  Environmental Considerations. Each proposed subproject will have been screened for \nits environmental impacts in compliance with the requirements of the Government and ADB6 \nand  will  not  cause  any  major  adverse  impact  on  the  environment  in  accordance  with  the \nEnvironmental Assessment Review Framework. ADB will have received and reviewed the initial \nenvironmental examination, if any, prepared for a proposed subproject. All necessary approvals \nand  clearances  will  have  been  obtained  for  the  subproject  from  all  relevant  government \nagencies.  The  requirements,  procedures  for  environmental  assessment,  together  with  the \nsample  terms  of  reference  of  the  environmental  specialist  for  this  purpose  is  included  in \nsupplementary appendixes I and J.  \n \n10.  Counterpart  Funding.  BR  will  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart  funding  will  be \nallocated to implement the subproject on a timely and efficient manner, in accordance with the \noverall implementation schedule. \n \n11.  Government Approvals. For each subproject, all necessary Government approvals will \nhave been obtained.  \n \nC.  Approval Process for Subprojects  \n \n12.  All subprojects will be required to comply with ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines, and satisfy \nADB\u2019s procedures for subproject preparation with respect to technical, operational, economic, \nsocial, indigenous people, resettlement, and other requirements. BR will ensure that sufficient \ncounterpart funding will be available. The aforementioned requirements were applied for the \nsample  subproject  during  project  preparation  and  were  found  to  be  technically  feasible, \neconomically viable, socially responsible, and environmentally sound. For additional noncore \nsubprojects, the requirements must be met during subproject implementation. \n \n13.  During  the  early  stages  of  Investment  Project  implementation,  the  project \nimplementation unit will prepare an appraisal report for one or more subprojects covering all the \nstipulated ADB requirements with assistance of the detailed design and construction supervision \nconsultant. The report will be sent to ADB for review and approval. Upon ADB\u2019s approval, the \nproject implementation unit will proceed with further subproject preparation, procurement, and \nsubproject implementation. Subproject designs will explore all options to avoid and/or minimize \nland acquisition and resettlement.  \n \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1995.

\n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Dhaka\u2013Chittagong rail corridor has a total length of 321 kilometers (km), with 121 \nkm doubled-tracked. Double tracking the Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar section is the sample subproject \nof the Investment Project of the Railway Sector Investment Program. Double tracking the other \nsections will be financed by other sources or as another subproject. Hence, all single-track \nsections will be double-tracked within the Project\u2019s time frame. Because of the impact of the \ncorridor network, economic and financial analyses must be carried out for double-tracking all of \nthe 200 km of single-tracked sections.  \n \nB.  Traffic Forecasts \n \n2.  Bangladesh Railway (BR) data shows that for fiscal year (FY) 2005, the passenger \nvolume in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor was 1,422 million passenger-km for intercity services; \nthis is growing at 6.1% per annum. For FY2005, the freight volume in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \ncorridor was 144 million ton-km for container services and 108 million ton-km for other cargo. \nBR statistics show that container volume grew at 8% per annum and other cargo by 5%. All the \nexisting lines in the subproject corridors have already reached their capacity; after 2008, no \nadditional freight traffic growth is expected to be possible. When the subproject is open for \nservice in 2009, rail capacity will double, and boost the annual growth rate substantially, i.e., \n25% for containers, 17% for other freight, and 10% for intercity train passengers before the \ngrowth rate gradually returns to the current rates. \n \nC.  Costs \n \n3.  The  financial  costs  of  double-tracking  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  line  consist  of  all \nincremental capital expenditures, but exclude price contingency and interest and other charges \nduring construction. The incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the subproject \nfacilities were estimated on the basis of O&M cost parameters developed by BR from its \naccumulated cost data. The economic costs include the resource costs for construction, rolling \nstock  acquisition  costs,  O&M  costs,  and  social  costs  arising  from  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement compensation. Economic costs exclude price contingencies, taxes, duties, and \ninterest during construction. A standard conversion factor of 0.80 was applied to financial costs \nof nontraded inputs to calculate economic prices. \n \nD.  Benefits and Revenues \n \n4.  The main economic benefits generated by the subproject were quantified in terms of (i) \nrailway  operating  cost  savings  arising  from  faster  travel  times  for  goods  and  passenger \nservices, (ii) savings in operating costs for freight and passenger traffic arising from traffic \ndiverted from road to rail made possible with the increase in rail capacity, (iii) savings in working \ncapital loss for freight traffic arising from time savings including elimination of waiting times to \nget slots on railways for the goods being transported, and (iv) time savings for passengers \narising  from  faster  train  travel  times.  Other  benefits,  such  as  savings  in  avoided  road \nmaintenance costs arising from the reduction in laden trucks using the road because the goods \nare being transported by railways, are not considered in the economic evaluation, thus making \nthis analysis conservative. \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  55 \n5.  In  the  financial  evaluation,  incremental  revenue  is  based  on  passenger  and  freight \nrevenue with and without the subproject. The tariff used to calculate the financial internal rate of \nreturn  (FIRR)  is  Tk2.80/ton-km  for  container  freight,  Tk1.91/ton-km  for  other  freight,  and \nTk0.5631/passenger-km for intercity train passengers. The tariff structure is not assumed to \nchange for either freight or passengers. Thus, the financial evaluation is conservative. \n \nE.  Economic and Financial Internal Rates of Return \n \n6.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and FIRR were calculated for the base case \nand for five sensitivity test cases, i.e., (i) construction costs increase by 10%; (ii) benefits or \ngross earnings are reduced by 10%; (iii) O&M costs increase by 10%; (iv) the construction \nperiod lengthens by 1 year; and (v) the construction period lengthens by 1 year and O&M costs \nincrease by 10%. Table A12 summarizes the EIRR and FIRR values.  \n \nTable A12: Economic and Financial Internal Rates of Return Values for Base Case and \nSensitivity Analysis Cases \n \n \nEconomic Internal  Financial Internal Rate \nScenario \nRate of Return  of Return \n \nA.

The EIRR for the base case is 16%, but above the threshold value of 12% for all the \nsensitivity cases. Hence, this subproject is economically viable. The FIRR for the base case is \n14%. The weighted average cost of capital is 5% and so this subproject is financially viable. All \nthe sensitivity analysis cases also showed that the FIRR is above the threshold weighted \naverage cost of capital.  \n \n8.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nThe Government gives high priority to improving the railway sector and proposes to finance priority investments to \novercome capacity bottlenecks, and implement organizational and policy reforms to improve the railway\u2019s operational \nand financial performance. This is to increase the sector\u2019s contribution to national economic growth. The absence of \nadequate railway infrastructure exacerbated by severe shortage of capacity on some critical sections, which include \nthe major economic and population corridors, has been considered an impediment to development, particularly for the \ntransport of goods, freight, and passenger traffic between regions. Infrastructure development encourages other \ndevelopment initiatives, which together considerably stimulate economic growth. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                          Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe Investment Project of the Railway Sector Investment Program t will concentrate on enhancing capacity to \novercome  constraints  to  increasing  rail  services  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  where  demand  for  intercity \npassenger and freight services is high. This involves improving and double-tracking of 196 kilometers (km) of the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong rail corridor. The core subproject covers a distance of approximately 64 km from Tongi\u2013to Bhairab \nBazar, which covers a total of three districts: Gazipur, Narsindhi, and Kishoreganj. \n \nIn Bangladesh, the incidence of povertya is high at 44.9% in rural areas compared with 43.3% for the urban \npopulation. The pace of rural poverty reduction was slow in the 1980s, but increased in the 1990s. The reverse is true \nfor urban areas. Progress in poverty reduction over the 1990s has been unequal across regions, with considerable \ndistrict variation in poverty, as suggested by the district agricultural wage data and various indicators of social \ndeprivations such as illiteracy and child mortality. In 1999, the national monthly per household income was Tk4,812 \nwith much lower levels of income for poor households (Tk3,006), especially for the rural poor. Government records \nreveal that nearly 31% of the population in the country are engaged as wage laborers in agricultural, nonagricultural, \nand industrial activities; of these, 46% are poor households with the majority living in rural areas. Regional variation in \npoverty is also influenced by the incidence of natural hazards and tends to be higher in disaster-prone areas. The level \nof poverty is typically higher for the landless, especially those who have agricultural wage labor as their principal \noccupation, and for those engaged in marginal occupations and skills. The national headcount measure for poverty is \nhighest among households with agricultural and nonagricultural daily wages as their main source of income, which is \nagain more predominant among rural households. Significant gender disparity also exists in income poverty. The \nincidence of poverty is generally higher for households headed, managed, and supported by women, with female \nworkers earning considerably less than males. The lower average consumption for females is also evident from the \npersistent gender inequality in severe malnutrition, mortality, and morbidity. \n \nThe Dhaka\u2013Chittagong rail corridor is one of the most important economic and population corridors, with the majority \nof fertilizer, natural gas, electric power, and garment industries located in this region. Overall, expansion of rail \ncapacity would lead to increased freight and passenger services to other regions of the country, thereby creating \nopportunities for economic and social development that would lead to poverty reduction. As this corridor provides the \ntransport linkage from the port of Chittagong not only to Dhaka but also to the rest of the rail network, the sample \nsubproject will facilitate growth of local markets and industries thereby creating more employment opportunities, with \nsubstantial opportunities being passed on to unskilled workers of the area. Thus the sample subproject will connect \nlocal communities, especially the poor and excluded, to increased employment and market opportunities.  \n \nFreight charges by railways will be cheaper than transportation by roads. The benefit of the improved transportation \nfacilities by rail will be passed on to the individual shipper, trader, and entrepreneur in the form of lower freight rates. \nThe decrease in the cost of movement of freight will also reduce the cost of the product. The sample subproject will \nlead to faster traveling times and rapid delivery and pickup of cargo. Similarly, the travel time for goods movements \nbetween West Bengal will be shortened and from Chittagong Port to other regions will be reduced to a day instead of \n3\u20134 days.  \n ", "  Appendix 13  57 \n \nFaster passenger trips will be another major benefit to the people. With faster and more reliable services, travelers will \nincrease trip frequency for both business and other purposes. The intercity running costs will reduce as trains will \noperate on faster schedules. More frequent rail transport services will increase labor mobility. The sample subproject \nwill also reduce poverty by providing employment opportunities during construction and operation to the local people, \nespecially the poor. It will provide increased business opportunities to the suppliers of goods and services to the \nrailways and thus generate more employment opportunities. The improvement of the rail network will enable the \npeople, especially the poor in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor, to have greater accessibility to other infrastructure \nservices, for example, schools, universities, and hospitals, as the trip time will be decreased and they will be able to \nreach these facilities more efficiently. Serious road accidents should be reduced somewhat as trucks and buses \nconstitute about 48% of the vehicles responsible for over 80% of accidental deaths. Air pollution should be reduced as \na consequence of rail gaining a larger share relative to highway as a consequence of traffic diversions. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nConsultations and meetings were conducted with various project communities during the course of the social analysis \nto ascertain their response to the improvement of the rail network. Assessment was made on their needs, demands, \nestimates of losses that they would suffer, and steps to mitigate such losses. Apart from the public meetings, focus \ngroup discussions were organized during the course of the social appraisal. These discussions were held with men, \nwomen, farmers, traders, entrepreneurs, nongovernment organizations, and Bangladesh Railway officials to ensure a \ncomprehensive perspective on the Project as well as its impacts. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nConsultation with both men and women was ensured during the course of the social analysis to assess the impact of \nthe Project on them. Currently the major portions of the existing route is single line and the frequency of train service is \nirregular creating problems for men and women in reaching the work place and accessing other social services on \ntime. Due to less frequent train service, platforms, waiting area, and train compartments get overcrowded, especially \nduring peak office hours when everyone wants to avail the same train service, posing more difficulty for women. The \nProject will lead to an increase in the frequency of the train service, and capacity of the platforms and waiting area will \nbe expanded, thus benefiting both men and women and offer special benefits to women by providing faster and more \nfrequent access to place of work and different social services like schools, health care facilities, markets, and \nincreased employment opportunities. The Project will also provide employment opportunities to both and women \nduring the construction phase and provisions will be included in contractors\u2019 bidding document to ensure that \ncontractors do not differentiate between men and women\u2019s wages and benefits for work of equal value. Contracts for \nall subprojects will include specific clauses on these undertakings, and compliance will be strictly monitored by \nBangladesh Railway during project implementation. Furthermore as the Project aims to improve the country\u2019s \ncompetitiveness in the manufacturing sector (principally the garment industry) by reducing the cost of transportation, \nand the vast majority of workers in the garment industry are women, this Project will facilitate the enhancement of \nsustained employment opportunities for women in the garment and other industries. \n. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Investment  Project  Background.  The  Investment  Project  of  the  Railway  Sector \nInvestment  Program  involves  improving  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  rail  corridor  from  single  to \ndouble track. The total project length or 321 kilometers (km) can be divided into seven sections; \nof these three already have a double track. A project preparatory technical assistance study \ninitiated  in  2003,  i.e.,  Regional  Rail  Traffic  Enhancement  Project,  made  various \nrecommendations  including  doubling  the  Dacca\u2013Tongi-Chittagong  railway  track  and \nBangladesh Railway (BR) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance for this. The \nimmediate and long-term objectives of the Investment Project are to (i) reduce travel time, (ii) \nincrease  the  volume  of  cargo  and  passenger  movement,  (iii)  ensure  uninterrupted \ncargo/passenger movement, and (iv) increase economic activities of the people in the region. \nAs a Multitranche Financing Facility Investment Project, the sections are classified as (i) sample \nsubproject to be appraised by ADB or (ii) nonsample subprojects to be prepared, screened, and \nappraised by BR prior to submission to ADB for approval under the sector lending approach. \nThe section Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar (64 km) has been selected as the sample subproject for loan \nprocessing. Although most of the improvement will be carried out within existing BR land, the \nsubproject will affect 832 households and other establishments (4,389 people will be affected) in \n6 thanas of Gazipur, Narshingdi, and Kishoreganj districts. In addition, an estimated 1,222 \npeople in 225 households are likely to be affected due to acquisition of agricultural land. Apart \nfrom these, some 170 agricultural leaseholders and 100 commercial leaseholders will lose \naccess to land (licensed from BR) and suffer losses in their livelihood. \n \n2.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The subproject will need additional \nland on the left of the existing railway embankments from Tongi to Bhairab Bazar. The small \nbridges will be built/strengthened for accommodation of the second track. However, the larger \nbridges (more than 12.2 meters) will need a second structure with 1 km approach at each end.  \n \nTable A14.1: Acquisition of Assets for the Subproject \n \n  Acquisition  Acquisition of  Acquisition of \n  of Land  Structure (sm)   Trees (number) \nDistricts  (ha) \nGazipur  4  5,113  3,060 \nNarshingdi  12  26,319  2,560 \nKishoreganj  0  121  0 \nTotal  16  31,553  5,620 \n          ha = hectare, sm = square meter. \n          Source: Socioeconomic survey, June 2004.  \n \n3.  The subproject will require an estimated 16.00 hectares (ha) of additional land; 4 ha in \nGazipur and 12 ha in Norshingdi districts (Table A14.1). The estimate is based on the technical \ndesign for 18.2 to 21.4 meters right-of-way from the central line of the existing railway track. The \nadverse impacts due to vacating the right-of-way land over a length of 64 km will displace 832 \nhouseholds and establishments. The displacement will cause dismantling of 31,553 square \nmeters (sm) of structures of different categories and felling 5,620 trees of various species and \nsizes. As the Executing Agency of the project, BR will implement the land acquisition and \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \nresettlement plan for replacement of lost assets by those affected and restitution of their pre-\nproject socioeconomic condition.  \n4.  Socioeconomic  Information  of  People  Affected.  A  full  census  and  a  sample \nsocioeconomic survey were conducted in June 2004 to identify those affected, the impact \ncategories, losses, and their socioeconomic condition. The date of conducting the survey will be \nconsidered  as  the  cut-off  date  for  payment  of  resettlement  benefits.  Video  filming  of  all \nstructures on the right-of-way was prepared to control fraudulent claims. However, the database \nwill be updated for concrete information as per final design. About 4,389 people will be affected \ndue to displacement of 237 households and 570 small business enterprises (Table 14.2). In \naddition, 25 community structures (including a toilet) will be displaced. Apart from this, 225 \nhouseholds would lose narrow strips of agricultural land and some of the persons will lose \naccess to agricultural and commercial plots licensed from BR (para 3, section 1). Average \nhousehold size is 5.44 and male-female ratio is 100:88. The households/shops include 211 \nowners,  62  occupants,  217  squatters,  25  encroachers  and  317  tenants.  Women  head  21 \nhouseholds. The project will not affect any indigenous people or ethnic minorities.  \n \nTable A14.2: Project Impacts and Displacements \n \nTenancy to  Total People \nHHs  SBEs  CRPs  Total  % \nLand  Affected \nEncroacher  14  9 2 25 126  2.87\nOccupier  13  48 1 62 269  6.13\nOwner  134  61 16 211 1,138  25.93\nSquatter  38  174 5 217 1,105  25.17\nTenant  38  278 1 317 1,751  39.90\n  Total  237  570 25 832 4,389  100\nHHs = households, SBEs = small business enterprises, CRPs  = community resources properties. \nSource: Socioeconomic Survey, June 2004 \n5.  Very few people living on the right-of-way are involved in agro-farming (5.4%) as a \nsource of income. Small business is the primary occupation of 47.44% of the income earners, \nwhile 17% are involved in services and 10% in petty trading. About 6% of the income earners \nare female, most are service providers (34%). About 15.37% of the households and shop-\nowners on the right-of-way earn up to Tk2,550 per month, which is below the extreme poverty \nline.1 Sixteen percent (16.73%) have income between Tk2,550 and Tk3,600,2 still below the \npoverty line. Twenty-one percent earn a moderate income between Tk3,600 and Tk5,000. The \nremaining 47% earn higher incomes above Tk5,000. This means that 32.10% of the affected \nhouseholds are poor.     \n6.  Legal Framework for Land Acquisition. At the design stage, the subproject will take \nall measures to reduce the amount of land acquisition and population displacement to the \nminimum, taking into account the need for the subproject. The Acquisition and Requisition of \nImmovable Property Ordinance (1982) will be applied, including the subsequent amendments \nfrom 1993\u20131995. The ordinance requires that compensation be paid for (i) land and assets \npermanently acquired (including standing crops, trees, houses), and (ii) any other damages \ncaused by such acquisition. The deputy commissioner, through a committee, determines the \nmarket  price  of  assets  based  on  the  approved  procedure  and  pays  an  additional  50% \n                                                 \n1  Extreme poverty line is calculated at Tk510 per person per month. \n2  The official poverty line is calculated for 2,122 kilocalorie intake per person per day, which is ensured by a per \ncapita monthly income of Tk720. \n ", "  Appendix 14  61 \n     \ncompensation on the assessed value. The 1994 amendment made provisions for payment of \ncrop  compensation  to  tenant  cultivators.  The  ordinance,  however,  does  not  cover  people \naffected  by  a  project  who  do  not  have  titles  or  ownership  records  such  as  informal \nsettlers/squatters.  \n7.  Objectives of the Resettlement Plan. This summary resettlement plan (RP) addresses \nboth resettlement and rehabilitation issues within the legal framework of the Government and \nADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement. The RP will cover those displaced by the subproject \nand provide income restoration assistance to the poor and informal settlers3 on the railway \nembankment. Thus, the RP approach incorporates (i) land acquisition and resettlement issues, \n(ii) impact mitigation with special attention to women and vulnerable groups, and (iii) income \ngenerating  activities  as  a  development  program.  The  main  principles  of  the  RP  are  to  (i) \nminimize negative impacts in consultation with the design engineers and BR; (ii) closely consult \nthose affected on RP policy, and poverty and rehabilitation issues; (iii) carry out resettlement \nand social development activities to improve or at least restore the pre-project standards of \nliving of those affected;4 and (iv) provide compensation for affected property at market price \nprior to relocation.  \n8.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy. The 1982 Ordinance is the only law that \nprovides clearly defined compensation for land acquisition for development projects. In the \nabsence of a national resettlement policy, ADB policy on involuntary resettlement5 was followed \nin preparing the RP. Compensation for lost assets (land, tree, structure, and other physical \nestablishments) will be accorded to the owners through the deputy commissioners as per \nmarket  value  assessed  through  legal  procedure  (Table  A14.3).  An  entitlement  matrix  was \ndeveloped that describes the unit of entitlements for compensating for lost assets, various \nresettlement  assistance,  and  benefits.  Any  positive  differential  for  acquired  assets  for \nreplacement market value as assessed by the property valuation advisory team (PVAT) through \nan independent agency and other resettlement benefits as per ADB policy will be provided. \nHouseholds headed by women and other vulnerable households will be eligible for further cash \nassistance for relocation. \n \nTable A14.3: Entitlement Matrix \nType of Loss  Application  Definition of  Entitlement  Expected Results \nPeople Affected \n1.

Disclosure  of  Resettlement  Plan  and  Stakeholders'  Participation.  Public \nconsultation  meetings  were  held  at  various  locations  involving  those  affected,  business \ncommunity, and community leaders. The project concept and land acquisition requirements as \nper design were presented to them. They were consulted on their options and restrictions due to \nimproved  railway  and  impact  on  trade  and  transportation  of  agricultural  and  industrial \ncommodities.  Public  consultation  was  carried  out  at  various  places  on  the  65  km  railway \nembankment during the survey. Those affected had the opportunity to express their choices on \nrelocation and resettlement in the consultation meetings. Finally, participation of project-affected \npeople is also ensured through their involvement in the grievances redress committees (GRCs). \nThe  resettlement  unit  within  the  project  implementation  unit,  BR  field  offices,  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  establish  and  continuously  maintain  an  ongoing \ninteraction  with  those  affected  and  communities  to  identify  problems  and  undertake \nremedial/correctional actions. BR has notified those affected of the RP. A summary of the RP \nwas prepared specifically for this purpose and translated into simple Bangla, and presented in \nthe form of a brochure, to enable local communities to read it by themselves and be aware of \n ", "  Appendix 14  63 \n     \nthe subproject's benefits and provisions available herein for various types people affected, as \ngiven in the entitlement matrix. In addition, the RP will be disclosed through the official websites \nof BR and ADB.  \n10.  Relocation of Housing and Settlement. The subproject is taking land along a long \nnarrow strip. It will not be desirable to provide an organized relocation site because this will \ncause  more  social  disruption.  The  subproject  will  encourage  \u201cself-relocation\u201d  by  affected \nhouseholds selecting replacement homestead land in the vicinity of their relatives. The objective \nis to minimize social disruption in the resettlement process and allow people to remain together \nwithin  kin  groups  for  mutual  support.  The  affected  households  and  shops  are  very  much \ninterested in remaining close to the present location for their client base, income and livelihood \nopportunity associated with the railway stations, and market places developed near the railway \nline. The subproject will provide support to the host area in the form of additional civic amenities \n(for  example,  provision  for  tube-wells  for  drinking  water,  schools,  and  access  roads,  if \nnecessary) for community uses. This will encourage villagers to accept more of those affected in \ntheir vicinities.  \n11.  Income  Restoration  Strategy.  The  vulnerable  people  affected,  including  those \nexperiencing  indirect  or  secondary  impacts,  will  be  eligible  for  assistance  due  to  loss  of \nemployment/wages because of dislocation. There is the risk that the cash compensation to the \nhead of the household may not meet the women's and children's subsistence. Therefore, the \neligible members of affected families should receive training and credit support for income \ngenerating activities for sustainable income restoration. The poor and the vulnerable will be \ncovered under income generating activities through HRD and OSD training and subsequent \ncredit support. The RP will have provisions to provide assistance to affected CBEs to restore \nand  regain  their  businesses.  All  CBEs,  irrespective  of  titled/nontitled  owners  of  business \npremises, will receive a cash grant for loss of access to business premise, plus shifting or \nmoving allowance, and one-time cash grant for loss of income. This assistance is intended to \nsupplement CBEs duration transitional period to reestablish businesses in new locations. \n12.   Institutional Framework. BR will implement the RP by setting up a resettlement unit \nwithin the project implementation unit, which will be established for the Investment Project. The \nresettlement unit, under the overall responsibility of the project director, will implement the RP. \nThe resettlement unit will have one deputy director at headquarters and one deputy director in \nthe field who will implement the plan. The resettlement unit staff will be trained after deployment. \nThe project director will confirm the land acquisition with assistance of district administrations \nand deputy directors (Resettlement). Upon clearance of the land acquisition proposal by the \ndeputy commissioner or Ministry of Land, a PVAT will be formed through Government gazette to \nrecommend  replacement  market  price  of  land  and  other  properties.  PVAT  will  have \nrepresentatives from BR in the chair, representative from the implementing NGO as the member \nsecretary, and representative from the deputy commissioners. An implementing NGO will be \ncontracted to assist the resettlement unit in implementing the resettlement tasks. The NGO will \ncollect,  collate,  computerize,  and  process  data  for  identification  of  eligible  people  for \nresettlement benefits and assess their entitlements as per RP policy. The resettlement unit will \neffect the payments after necessary scrutiny.  \n \n13.  GRCs  will  be  established  with  representation  from  BR,  those  affected, \nwomen/vulnerable groups, local government, and NGOs. Those affected can call upon the \nsupport of NGOs to assist them in presenting their grievances or queries to the GRC. The \ndeputy director, resettlement, field, will chair the GRC. Other than disputes relating to ownership \nright under the court of law, the GRC will review grievances involving all resettlement benefits, \nrelocation, and other assistance. Grievances will be redressed within a month from the date of \n ", "64  Appendix 14 \nlodging the complaints. To ensure people\u2019s participation, the NGO will form a resettlement \nadvisory  committee  comprising  local  leaders,  both  men  and  women,  such  as  people's \nrepresentatives, teachers, imams, knowledgeable persons, headmen, etc. The committee will \nadvise on the best ways to implement the RP smoothly and efficiently. The GRCs, resettlement \nadvisory committees, as well as the JVT and PVAT formed and activated during the land \nacquisition process will allow those affected sufficient time to lodge complaints and safeguard \ntheir recognized interests.  \n14.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Budget and Financing. The land acquisition and \nresettlement  budget  includes  all  costs  for  acquisition  of  assets  and  costs  associated  with \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  The  management  and  implementation  of  RP  activities  include \nadditional studies for needs assessment, capacity building, hiring NGO for implementation, \ntransport, monitoring and evaluation, etc. The total estimated cost is Tk216.09 million ($3.712 \nmillion) and will be financed by the Government. At this stage, the costs can be considered as \nestimates and will be revised after updating the RP database during implementation.  \n \nTable A14.4: Land Acquisition and Resettlement Budget \n \nCost Items  $ million  Tk million \nLand Acquisition  2.597  151.96 \nResettlement  0.672  39.29 \nRehabilitation  0.259  15.20 \nAdministration and Management  0.184  10.75 \n  Total  3.712  216.09 \n \n15.  RP Implementation Schedule. The RP will be implemented from April 2007 over 3 \nyears. BR will initiate some advance actions such as the establishment of the resettlement unit; \nidentification of resettlement staff in the field offices; formation of PVAT and GRCs; and hiring of \nan NGO for resettlement implementation following loan negotiations. The overall schedule of RP \nimplementation is based on the principle that people affected by land acquisition are paid their \nlegal compensation and due resettlement benefits prior to relocation. House transfer will be \nassisted  prior  to  or  during  relocation  of  the  households  from  the  right-of-way.  The  RP \nimplementation schedule may be revised as per field situation in consultation with BR and \nconcurrence from ADB.  \n16.  Monitoring and Evaluation. Land acquisition and resettlement implementation will be \nsupervised  and  monitored  by  the  project  director  in  coordination  with  the  deputy  director-\nresettlement,  BR  field  staff,  construction  supervision  consultant,  and  the  resettlement-\nimplementing  NGO.  The  monitoring  will  be  done  both  internally  and  externally  to  provide \nfeedback  to  BR  and  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  RP  implementation  process.  A \ncomputerized  management  information  system  will  be  in  operation  for  monitoring  RP \nimplementation.  The  internal  monitoring  by  BR  will  deal  with  all  aspects  of  relocation, \nresettlement,  and  rehabilitation  of  the  households.  The  field  deputy  director-resettlement, \nassisted  by  the  RP  implementing  NGO  will  conduct  field  monitoring  and  assess  the  daily \noperation of resettlement activities.  \n \n17.  The resettlement specialist of the construction supervision consultant will supervise, \nmonitor, and assist RP implementation. The supervision and monitoring work will involve review \nof resettlement implementation, verification of the results of internal monitoring in the field, and \nconsultation with those affected, officials, and community leaders for preparing review reports. \n ", "  Appendix 14  65 \n     \nMonthly progress reports will be prepared and submitted to the project director by the NGO. \nDuring the implementation, the project director will periodically send status reports to ADB on \nRP  implementation  and  a  final  report  once  the  resettlement  is  completed.  An  external \nmonitoring and evaluation agency with sufficient skills and capacity in monitoring resettlement \nimplementation will be assigned within 3 months of loan approval. The agency will provide a \nbiannual review and report both to ADB and BR. BR will report to ADB on land acquisition, \nresettlement, and income generation program in the quarterly reports, including identification of \nsignification issues. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20061019103854+08'00'", "Author": "GTB", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20061019103854+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RRP-MFF-19 Oct 2006 for Posting.doc"}, "author_page": " \n \n \n \n \nVice President  L.
