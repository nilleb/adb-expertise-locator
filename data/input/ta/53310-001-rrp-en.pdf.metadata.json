THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $70,000,000 (or its yuan equivalent) to Citic Financial Leasing Co. Ltd. (CFL) for the Solar \nEnergy Finance Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing long-tenor financing to \nCFL for lease finance to solar power plants (SPPs) for solar energy generation in the PRC. ADB \nfinancing will meet CFL\u2019s requirements for long-term funding, which is in short supply in the PRC, \nand will enable CFL to provide long-tenor lease finance to SPPs. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Solar power overview. The PRC has been the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemitter since 2007.1 It produced 9.22 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 2017, equivalent to 28% of \nglobal  carbon  dioxide  emissions.2 In  September  2016,  the  PRC  officially  joined  the  Paris \nAgreement after completing the domestic legislative process, signifying its commitment to fight \nglobal warming and reduce GHGs under a measurable target. The government has boosted \nsupport for investment in renewable energy, mainly in solar and wind power projects. Key support \nmeasures include (i) the legal framework for a 20-year feed-in tariff (FIT), which is not subject to \nretrospective application of price changes; (ii) a centrally planned, newly installed capacity \nprogram governed by the National Energy Association; and (iii) a government fund that subsidizes \nthe grid company to take on part of the FIT obligation for the electricity generation companies. \n \n4.  Electricity generated from solar photovoltaic assets has grown rapidly from 29 terawatt-\nhours in 2014 to 131 terawatt-hours in 2017.3 As of year-end (YE) 2018, the PRC\u2019s solar power \ngeneration capacity reached 174 gigawatts (GW), a 34% increase from 2017, and accounted for \n24% of the 728 GW installed renewable energy capacity. As the cost of solar photovoltaic energy \nhas decreased significantly because of increased economies of scale and enhanced technology, \nthe government will remove renewable energy generation subsidies in 2020. However, this policy \nchange will not have an impact on existing solar power assets in operation, which will continue to \nbenefit from the FIT scheme at the start of plant operation. Subsidy removal will also have limited \nimpact on new solar photovoltaic projects, as such assets will be designed to reach an acceptable \nrate of return without relying on subsidies. In 2019, the government approved the first grid-parity \nsolar photovoltaic project list, with nearly 15 GW capacity. Significant investment must continue \nto be made in renewable energy projects to meet the government\u2019s commitment to fight climate \nchange and pursue environmentally sustainable development. It is expected that 20\u201350 GW of \nsolar photovoltaic energy generation capacity will be installed each year from 2019 to 2050. \nCoupled with the retirement and replacement of solar modules, large continuous investment in \nnew solar power generation assets will be required, creating vast financing needs. \n \n5.  Leasing industry overview. Leasing provides a good solution for long-term solar power \nequipment financing as banks usually do not recognize movable assets, such as equipment, as \ncollateral. The PRC\u2019s leasing industry has been growing rapidly, targeting a financing gap that \n \n1  International  Energy  Agency.  Key  World  Energy  Statistics  2019.  https://www.iea.org/statistics/  (accessed \n7 November 2019). \n2  BP P.L.C. 2019. BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019. London. \n3  International Energy Agency. Online Data and Statistics database. \nhttps://www.iea.org/statistics/?country=CHN&isISO=true (accessed 7 November 2019). \n ", "2 \ntraditional bank financing does not address. New leasing sales in the PRC expanded from \n$21.88 billion in 2008 to $265.68 billion in 2017, representing a compound annual growth rate of \n31.97%.4 Despite rapid growth, the PRC\u2019s financial leasing industry needs further development. \nThe PRC\u2019s lease penetration rate, measured as a percentage of lease finance to total gross \ndomestic product, was 2.21% in 2017, ranking it 12th out of 50 countries and indicating ample \nroom for growth. With total outstanding lease receivables of CNY6.55 trillion in 2018, leasing is \nalso much smaller than banking, which had total outstanding loans of CNY108.56 trillion in 2018 \n(footnote 4). \n \n6.  Rationale. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations have supported leasing in the PRC\u2014targeting \na diverse range of development subsectors\u2014given its underdevelopment and need for long-tenor \nfinancing. ADB has provided $475.00 million in debt to four PRC financial leasing companies \n(FLCs) for clean bus leasing since 2013.5 It has also provided $75.00 million for health care \nleasing and $60.00 million for small and medium-sized enterprise lease finance.6 In 2018, ADB \napproved a $150.00 million loan to an FLC to support health care finance in underdeveloped \nprovinces in the PRC.7 In 2019, ADB approved a $60 million loan to an FLC to support industrial \nand municipal wastewater treatment.8 This project builds on ADB\u2019s earlier experience in the \nPRC\u2019s leasing industry, using lease finance to support a new sector. Leasing is an attractive and \neffective financing modality for solar equipment as its long-term amortizing repayment profile \nbetter matches the lessee\u2019s operating cash flows. ADB identified CFL as a good partner to support \nsolar power financing given CFL\u2019s focus on solar energy and experience in financing SPPs. CFL \nhas strong shareholders, sound corporate governance, an experienced management team, \nadvanced risk management systems, and good financial performance. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  CFL was established in March 2015 as the only wholly owned subsidiary of the China Citic \nBank (CNCB) and is regulated by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission \n(CBIRC). By 30 June 2019, CFL had total assets of CNY49.70 billion, with outstanding gross \nlease receivables of CNY49.01 billion. Its registered capital is CNY4.00 billion. As a relatively \nyoung leasing company, CFL has had a specialization strategy since its establishment. Its \nbusiness focus is on green leasing, covering clean energy, energy savings, environmental \nprotection, and modern transportation. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n8.  CFL receives good support from CNCB in terms of management systems, brand value, \nliquidity  support,  and  business  development.  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED. \nSenior management is mainly from the parent bank and has extensive credit expertise. According \n \n4  White Clarke Group. 2019. Global Leasing Report 2019.

Ownership, Management, and Governance  \n \n9.  Ownership. CNCB, a national joint-stock commercial bank in the PRC, was set up in 1987 \nand has been listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since \n2007. As of 30 June 2019, CNCB had total assets of CNY6,398.80 billion. It is rated BBB+ by \nStandard & Poor\u2019s, Baa2 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and BBB by Fitch Ratings. As of \nJune 2019, CNCB\u2019s three largest shareholders were Citic Corporation Limited with a 65.37% \nshare, China Tobacco Corporation with 4.39%, and China Security Finance Corporation Limited \nwith 2.28%. Citic Corporation Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Citic Limited, which is \n58.13% owned by CITIC Group Corporation Ltd., which is in turn 100.00% owned by the PRC \nState Council. China Tobacco and China Security Finance are also 100.00% owned by the PRC \nState Council.10 Therefore, the Government of the PRC is CNCB\u2019s largest ultimate shareholder, \nholding about 45% of total shares. Integrity due diligence was conducted.11 No significant or \npotentially  significant  risks  were  identified.  Although  CFL\u2019s  beneficial  owners  could  not  be \nidentified, the potential risk is mitigated by the fact that CNCB\u2019s relevant shares are held by public \nand institutional investors, and no shareholder other than the government holds more than a 5% \nindirect stake in CFL. ADB\u2019s review of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that it is \nbeing used for money laundering or terrorism financing. Tax integrity due diligence was not \nrequired because the transaction does not involve intermediate jurisdictions or material related \nparty transactions.12 \n \n10.  Management. CFL is led by an experienced management team comprising the chief \nexecutive officer (CEO) and four vice-presidents, four of whom held senior positions at CNCB \nbefore joining CFL. CEO Yu Ziyan has a master\u2019s degree and is a senior chartered economist \nwith more than 30 years of experience working in economics and finance. He was the deputy \ngeneral manager and chief risk officer at CNCB\u2019s Suzhou branch, deputy general manager of \nCNCB\u2019s Kunshan branch, general manager of the credit department of the Shanghai Pudong \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  Suzhou  branch,  and  deputy  general  manager  of  the  Bank  of \nCommunications\u2019 Suzhou branch.13 \n \n11.  Governance structure. CFL has a well-defined corporate governance structure. The \nboard of directors handles CFL\u2019s overall strategy, major decisions, key business objectives, and \nsenior management appointments. The board has six members, all appointed by the parent bank. \nThe composition of the board is typical for companies with only one shareholder. The chair, \nYang Yu,  has  a  doctorate  in  business  administration  and  is  a  senior  chartered  economist \naccredited  in  the  PRC.  He  has  36  years  of  experience  working  in  finance.  Yang  serves \nconcurrently as CNCB deputy general manager. Before joining CNCB, he held senior positions \n \n9  CBIRC. 2014.

The CEO also serves as executive \ndirector. There are three committees under the board: the risk management committee, the \nnomination and remuneration committee, and the audit and related party transaction committee. \nCFL also has a board supervisor, Jin Wei, who supervises the performance of the directors and \nsenior management. She worked almost 30 years at CNCB and has been CFL supervisor since \nthe company\u2019s establishment. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n12.  ADB will provide a senior secured loan to CFL of up to $70 million (or its yuan equivalent) \nwith a tenor of up to 5 years. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  Use of proceeds. CFL will use the proceeds of the ADB loan to finance the development \nand operation of SPPs for solar energy generation in the PRC. At least four SPPs will be financed, \nwith each subproject receiving no more than $17.50 million of the ADB loan proceeds. \n \n14.  Legal documentation. The loan to CFL will be governed by a facility agreement, which \nwill be based on ADB\u2019s customary terms and conditions for a loan of this nature and amount. \n \n15.  Reporting arrangements. ADB will carry out project monitoring over the life of the project. \nCFL will provide ADB with financial and other reports at predetermined regular intervals and as \nrequested, including (i) semiannual unaudited financial statements, (ii) annual audited financial \nstatements,  (iii) compliance  certificates  for financial  covenants,  (iv)  periodic  reports  on  the \nunderlying leases financed through the proposed loan, (v) annual reports on the implementation \nstatus of the environmental and social management system (ESMS), and (vi) annual reporting on \nselected development indicators agreed by ADB and the borrower. \n \n16.  Evaluation. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will prepare monitoring reports \nand submit them to ADB\u2019s Office of Risk Management regularly and at least annually. The first \nreport will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n17.  Providing critically needed long-term finance. The PRC\u2019s leasing industry is still in the \nearly stages of development. Most funding is available to companies at 1-year tenor. As noted in \npara. 15, CFL has a significant maturity mismatch between its assets and liabilities. Long-tenor \nfunding of 5 years from ADB will help support CFL\u2019s long-tenor financing for SPPs, with typical \nlease terms of 5\u201310 years, thereby contributing to the improvement of CFL\u2019s asset\u2013liability profile. \nThis, in turn, will increase CFL\u2019s capacity to expand operations and address its funding gap. \n \n18.  Enhancing Citic Financial Leasing Co. Ltd.\u2019s environmental and social safeguard \ncapacity and supporting gender equity. ADB will be the first international financial institution to \nprovide financing to CFL. As a disbursement condition, CFL must establish an ESMS that meets \nthe requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB will continue to work with \n ", "5 \nCFL throughout the ADB investment period to enhance CFL\u2019s safeguard capacity, support its \nadherence to high safeguard standards, and promote gender-inclusive measures in operations. \nCFL will appoint a gender champion to empower and help create opportunities for CFL\u2019s female \nstaff, including mentorship and leadership training. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n19.  Impacts. The project is expected to have the following development impacts: \n(i)  Renewable energy generation capacity increased. By financing SPPs, the \nproject  will  help  increase  solar  power  capacity,  thus  supporting  the  PRC\u2019s \ncommitment in its intended nationally determined contribution under the Paris \nAgreement to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and to increase non-fossil fuel \nenergy to 20% of its energy mix. \n(ii)  Financial leasing industry developed. Despite rapid growth since 2008, the \nPRC\u2019s financial leasing industry is still underdeveloped, with a  lower leasing \npenetration rate than other developed markets. Access to finance remains a \nchallenge for most leasing companies, particularly for long-tenor loans, and the \nproject will help alleviate this funding bottleneck. \n \n20.  Outcome. The outcome will be development of solar energy projects. XX megawatts of \nsolar energy generation capacity will be installed, which is expected to generate about XX \nmegawatt-hours of electricity per year and lead to a GHG emissions reduction of about XX tons \nof carbon dioxide per year over the 5-year life of the ADB loan. \n \n21.  Outputs. The outputs will be the following: \n(i)  Citic Financial Leasing Co. Ltd.\u2019s solar energy lease operations expanded. \nCFL will provide an additional $70 million in lease finance to at least four SPPs. \n(ii)  Citic Financial Leasing Co. Ltd.\u2019s gender inclusiveness improved. The project \nwill strengthen CFL\u2019s gender inclusiveness in operations by providing mentorship \nand leadership training programs to female staff and internship programs to female \nstudents. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n22.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports \nStrategy 2030\u2019s operational priority of tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability.14 Under Strategy 2030, ADB will increase \nits emphasis on assisting developing member countries in improving environmental management, \nincluding efforts to foster green economic growth. ADB will scale up support for climate change \nmitigation by prioritizing investments for low GHG emission energy and provide $80 billion of \ncumulative  climate  finance  from  ADB\u2019s  own  resources  from  2019  to  2030.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC as it will support the \n \n14 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n ", "6 \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda to manage climate change and the environment, and to finance \nprivate sector-led initiatives to support climate change mitigation and adaptation.15 \n \n23.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which states that support for renewable energy projects will be \nprioritized and broadened, and private sector participation will be encouraged.16 Supporting \nfinance sector development is a key focus of development assistance for ADB, and the project \naligns with ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan.17 Client selection and project design reflect \nADB\u2019s experience in the PRC leasing industry by selecting financial intermediaries that have \nproven expertise in the targeted sector, and augmenting the design by leveraging the expertise \nof sector specialists and gender specialists in the early stages of structuring transactions. Lastly, \nthe project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, \n2013\u20132020.18 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n24.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement as category FI for the environment and involuntary resettlement, and category FI \ntreated as C for indigenous peoples.19 \n \n25.  Category FI. ADB has assessed the investment\u2019s potential environmental and social \n(E&S) impacts; its risks associated with CFL\u2019s existing and likely future portfolio; and its policies, \nprocedures,  commitment,  and  capacity  for  E&S  management.  During  due  diligence,  ADB \ndetermined that CFL\u2019s financial leasing for the development and operation of SPPs in the PRC is \nconsidered low to moderate risk and is expected to have limited and localized E&S impacts. \nPotential environmental impacts mainly involve temporary environmental, health, and safety \nimpacts during project construction; environmental, health, and safety impacts associated with \nsolar panel cleaning wastewater effluent discharge; power safety; fire prevention; disposal of \nwaste solar panels; and occupational health and safety exposures. These are considered less \nadverse and site-specific, few or none are irreversible, and the few impacts can be readily \naddressed by mitigation measures. As the proposed project is for equipment leasing, the climate \nchange impact risk is expected to be low. Solar energy generation can support climate change \nmitigation by reducing GHG emissions from fossil fuel. CFL\u2019s financial leasing to SPPs is not \nexpected to involve significant involuntary resettlement impacts as solar farms are primarily sited \non leased lands, and procuring small parcels of land will only be needed for substations and/or \noffice control rooms that will require permanent construction. CFL ensures that solar project lands \nare procured and/or leased and compensated following applicable laws on a willing buyer or \nlessee\u2013willing seller or lessor basis, and the processes are already completed by the government \nand relevant village committee before CFL\u2019s financing. CFL\u2019s portfolio includes lease financing of \nsolar power projects in areas with the presence of ethnic minority groups; SPPs in these areas \nare normally built on leased wastelands and are unlikely to entail impacts relating to physical or \neconomic displacements and/or indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities. \n \n15 ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n19 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "7 \n \n26.  CFL will adopt an ESMS satisfactory to ADB before the first disbursement. The ESMS will \ninclude an E&S policy, procedures for investment screening against ADB\u2019s prohibited investment \nactivities list; project E&S risks and impacts review and categorization; procedures for screening \nfunding for projects in environmentally and socially sensitive areas or critical habitats; an audit of \nthe land acquisition history, including impacts on vulnerable and non-titled land users; due \ndiligence on occupational health and safety issues; investment documentation; project E&S \nmanagement, monitoring, and reporting; E&S organization and capacity building; stakeholder \nengagement; meaningful consultation; and grievance redress mechanisms. CFL will exclude from \nADB financing solar power projects with significant impacts on the environment and involuntary \nresettlement and any adverse impacts on indigenous peoples. It will ensure that investments \nusing ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations and comply with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. CFL will appoint a designated E&S staff member to lead ESMS \nimplementation. \n \n27.  Labor and social protection.
