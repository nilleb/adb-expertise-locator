THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Government of Georgia (government) has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for a $50 million regular loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to support the proposed \nWater Supply and Sanitation Service Improvement Project. The project is aligned with the \ngovernment strategies1 and the priorities of the ADB Country Partnership Strategy 2014\u20132018 for \nGeorgia.2 The project and this transaction technical assistance (TA) are listed in the Country \nOperations Business Plan 2019\u20132021,3 and consistent with the Water Operational Plan 2011\u2013\n2020.4  \n \n2.  The project complements the ongoing Urban Services Improvement Investment Program \n(USIIP).5 The  project  aims  to  minimize  the  operational  inefficiencies  and  maximize  asset \nutilization of the United Water Supply Company of Georgia (UWSCG) in the selected areas of \nGeorgia. The project will assist UWSCG modernize its equipment and management information \nsystems, restructure the organization, develop capacity and improve commercial orientation. \nComplementary institutional reforms will be supported to ensure greater accountability for quality \nservice delivery including developing a water sector policy. \n \n3.  The envisaged project outputs are (i) facilitated high-level technology (HLT) solutions, and \n(ii) strengthened organization and institutions. These solutions will result in the following outcome: \nefficient, reliable and sustainable WSS service delivered in selected UWSCG service areas where \nthe government has invested significant infrastructure.6 The project will be aligned with the \nfollowing impact: health of residents of selected areas of Georgia improved.7   \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) will help the government prepare the \nproject. TA support is required to identify and facilitate HLT adoption, restructure UWSCG and \nbuild  organizational  and  institutional  capacity,  and  explore  public-private  partnership  (PPP) \nopportunities. TA will further identify and prepare capital investments that require urgent and \nimmediate works and are of high priority for operation and maintenance (O&M) and other \nessential works.  \n \n5.  TA will assist the government to (i) define the project scope, design and costs; (ii) assess \ninstitutional, organizational and capacity development needs; (iii) conduct due diligence for the \n                                                 \n1 The Government of Georgia. 2016.

TA will develop training needs of staff to accomplish their \nduties and identify recommended scope for future skills development and training \nprograms for the management, technical and operational staff. TA will consider cost-\neffective and gender-balanced options for sustainable learning and development to \nbuild up a steady stream of technical and skilled workforce in the sector and in \nUWSCG.  \n \n(iii)  PPP pilot in selected project areas. Private sector expertise will be solicited to more \neffectively acquire skills on-the-job, and deploy change management, processes and \npractices. TA will produce a comprehensive feasibility study to enable the government \nto determine PPP related project costs, affordability limits, risks and costs, and best \nvalue for money.

Among others, TA will facilitate \nclose coordination with concerned ministries/agencies to build consensus on PPP arrangement \nto preempt delays in PPP contract negotiations and procurement. Strong public relations and \ncommunication  channel  will  be  established  with  UWSCG,  selected  project  areas,  and  key \nstakeholders for timely TA implementation and effective coordination and delivery of activities. \nFor enhanced communications, TA will (i) prepare stakeholder communication matrix and strategy, \n ", "4 \nand (ii) conduct public awareness, consultation, and communication programs for behavioral \nchange on metering, water conservation and sanitation. \n \nC.
