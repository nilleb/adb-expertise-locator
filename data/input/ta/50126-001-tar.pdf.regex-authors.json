INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Bangladesh asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ncapacity development technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the institutional capacity of the \nAnti-Corruption Commission (ACC) of Bangladesh. Accordingly, the TA was included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Bangladesh.1 \n \n2.  ADB fielded a fact-finding mission on 16\u201318 October 2016 and consulted ACC as the \nexecuting agency, relevant government agencies, and development partners.2 The government \nconfirmed  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  financing  (including  counterpart \ncontributions), procurement, terms of reference for consultants, and the design and monitoring \nframework of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Corruption is a serious challenge hampering the inclusive and sustained development of \nBangladesh. Transparency International\u2019s latest published Corruption Perception Index (2015) \nranked Bangladesh 139th among 164 countries, with a score of 25 on a scale of 0\u2013100 (0 \nrepresenting the most corrupt and 100 representing the least corrupt). \n \n4.  To fight corruption effectively, the government enacted the Anti-Corruption Commission \nAct, 2004 and constituted the ACC. However, the ACC still lags in the inquiry, investigation, and \nprosecution of cases, which currently take more than 36 months to complete, according to ACC \nestimates.  The  proposed  TA  aims  to  improve  the  monitoring  of  the  ACC\u2019s  inquiry  and \ninvestigation capacity through the use of information and communication technology, which will \nenable cases to be completed more quickly. \n \n5.  For the ACC to become effective and gain public confidence, proper investigation and \nprosecution, and the timely disposal of cases leading to conviction are critical. More than 6,235 \ninquiries and investigations are pending, and around 4,000 cases are under trial in special \njudges\u2019 courts and higher courts. The ACC has around 300 inquiry officers and investigation \nofficers and more than 120 public prosecutors; however, the ACC lacks an automated system to \nmonitor and evaluate their activities, which delays the disposal of the cases. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2016\u20132018. Manila. In the country operations \nbusiness plan, the TA was named Strengthening Public Sector Institutions. However, as the scope of the proposed \nTA became more focused, the name was changed to Enhancing the Institutional Capacity of the Anti-Corruption \nCommission. \n2  The  ACC  is  a  statutory  and  independent  government  organization  established  under  the  Anti-Corruption \nCommission Act, 2004. The ACC is the designated government authority to fight and prevent corrupt practices in \nthe country. Its functions can be broadly divided into enforcement and prevention. The inquiry and investigation of \nallegations of corruption and the prosecution of the cases fall under enforcement; meanwhile, the ACC carries out \nawareness campaigns at various levels to promote the values of honesty and integrity, which falls under prevention. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 September 2016. \n ", "2 \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The  impact  will  be  the  improved  efficiency  of  the  ACC  in  combating  corruption,  in \nalignment with the government\u2019s 7th Five Year Plan.4 The outcome will be the ACC\u2019s enhanced \ncapacity to monitor investigation and prosecution. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The outcome of the TA will be achieved through four outputs. The key activities under \neach output are discussed below. \n \n8.  Output 1: Investigation and Prosecution Management System software developed. \nThe TA will study and analyze the ACC\u2019s current business processes to identify practical \nimprovements relating to the ACC\u2019s processes for inquiry, investigation, and prosecution. This \nwill be done by consulting relevant stakeholders. Based on these findings, the team will develop \nand operationalize Investigation and Prosecution Management System (IPMS) software for the \nACC with various modules, including (i) monitoring the activities of the inquiry and investigation \nofficers and prosecutors; (ii) managing the public prosecutors\u2019 bills and claims; (iii) digitizing and \narchiving documentary evidence relating to cases at the ACC headquarters; and (iv) creating a \ndatabase of the corruption-prevention committees, the integrity units, and the public hearings \nconducted by the ACC. \n \n9.  Output 2: Operations manual on the Investigation and Prosecution Management \nSystem approved. The operations manual on the IPMS will be finalized through a consultative \nprocess and submitted for the ACC\u2019s approval. \n \n10.  Output  3: Report  on  proposed  improvements  to  current  corruption-prevention \nactivities  completed.  A  report  will  be  prepared  in  consultation  with  various  stakeholders \nstudying the effectiveness of the ACC\u2019s current corruption-prevention activities and containing \npractical recommendations for improving ACC initiatives. \n \n11.  Output 4: Capacity development activities for the Anti-Corruption Commission \nconducted. The TA will coordinate with the relevant developing member country agency and \nprovide the necessary logistics support to facilitate at least one study tour within regional ADB \nmember countries for at least 10 participants. The purpose of the study tour is to gain practical \nexperience and share best practices in digital case management with respect to the monitoring \nsystem. In addition, at least 200 ACC staff will be trained on the IPMS, and dissemination \nworkshops and seminars regarding the scope and progress of the TA will be arranged for \nrelevant stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF- V). \n \n                                                 \n4  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015. 7th Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020: Accelerating \nGrowth, Empowering Citizens. Dhaka. \n ", "3 \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of project staff, office space, \noffice supplies, transport, communication, and other in-kind contributions. Disbursements under \nthe TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The  ACC  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  TA  and  will  establish  a  project \nmanagement unit and provide furnished office space for the project management unit and \nconsultants.  The  consultants  will  report  to  the  senior  public  management  officer  of  the \nBangladesh Resident Mission, but will still work in close coordination with the ACC. The ACC \nwill provide counterpart staff to ensure close coordination and smooth contract implementation. \nThe TA will be implemented over a 30-month period from January 2017 to June 2019. \n \n15.  A  project  steering  committee  will  also  be  formed  to  oversee  and  monitor  the \nimplementation  of  the  TA.  The  committee  will  meet  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  TA  will  be \nmonitored and evaluated through review missions, quarterly progress reports, and consultant\u2019s \nreports. Lessons learned and good practices derived from the TA will be disseminated through \nworkshops, training programs, and day-to-day interactions with the consultants. \n \n16.  A consulting firm will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time) using quality- and cost-based selection (80:20) with full \ntechnical  proposal.  The  assignment  will  involve  40  person-months  of  services  by  national \nconsultants. The consultant team will include (i) a team leader (12 person-months, intermittent); \n(ii)  a  legal  expert  (8  person-months,  intermittent);  (iii)  an  information  technology  expert  (8 \nperson-months, intermittent); (iv) a procurement expert (6 person-months, intermittent); and (v) \na  training  expert  (6  person-months,  intermittent).  The  consultants  will  be  responsible  for \nprocuring  the  software  and  hardware  and  developing  the  web-based  IPMS  software  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), with \nprior approval from ADB. \n \n17.  After TA completion, the hardware, software, and all other equipment will be turned over \nto the ACC, which will maintain the hardware and software with its own personnel and budget. \nTherefore, the ACC must ensure that it can provide adequate staff and funding to operate the \nsystem. At the same time, the ACC must commit to using the IPMS after project completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for Enhancing the Institutional Capacity of the Anti-Corruption \nCommission, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "4  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned With \nEfficiency of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in combating corruption improved (7th Five \nYear Plan)a  \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nwith Targets and  Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nThe ACC\u2019s  By 2019, IPMS used in  Consultant\u2019s report  Government support \ninvestigation and  the ACC headquarters  for combating \nprosecution  and seven divisional  corruption not \nmonitoring capacity  offices (2016 baseline:  sustained overtime \nenhanced  Not applicable) \nOutputs       \n1.
