INTRODUCTION \n1.  With vast low-lying deltas, Bangladesh is a country greatly at risk from climate change. \nThe  coastal  towns  in  Bangladesh  are  especially  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  country  operations  business  plan  for  Bangladesh,  2011\u201320131 \nidentifies the Coastal Towns Infrastructure Improvement Project. The timely implementation of \ncapacity development technical assistance (TA) for assessing the impacts of climate change \nand identifying adaptation options is deemed essential in maximizing the development impacts \nof  the  planned  project  in  the  coastal  towns.  This  view  has  been  fully  endorsed  by  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh.  \n \n2.  An ADB fact-finding mission was conducted from 23 to 31 January 2011. This report is \nbased on the understandings reached with the government during the mission regarding the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \noutline terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Bangladesh is made vulnerable to climate change by its geography, poverty, inadequate \ninfrastructure, limited social development, lack of institutional capacity, and high dependency on \nnatural resources. Though Bangladesh has made steady progress in social and economic \ndevelopment  and  poverty  alleviation,  the  country  as  a  whole,  and  in  particular  its  poorer \ncommunities, could suffer early and badly from climate change, negating past achievements. \nTherefore, strengthening resilience to climate change in coastal towns is a high priority on the \ndevelopment and poverty reduction agenda in Bangladesh. \n \n4.  In response to this vulnerability, the Government of Bangladesh prepared in November \n2005 the National Adaptation Program of Action, which determined that the most damaging \neffects of climate change are flooding, salinity intrusion, and drought, and that challenges \ninduced  by  climate  change  include  scarcity  of  freshwater;  drainage  congestion;  riverbank \nerosion; and wider salinity in surface water, groundwater, and soil. Most of the issues are \nrelated to urban water supply, drainage, and sanitation. Thorough analysis identified as future \nadaptation strategies to include (i) capacity building for integrating climate change in planning \nand designing infrastructure; and (ii) enhancing the resilience of urban infrastructure. However, \nthese  strategies  have  not  been  adequately  translated  into  concrete  actions  because  of \nconstraints on human resources and the lack of technical, institutional, and financial capacity. \nThe government adopted in September 2008 the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and \nAction Plan (BCCSAP), which is the basis of the country's efforts to combat climate change until \n2018. The BCCSAP addresses both mitigation and adaptation, with the emphasis on the latter, \nand identifies 37 priority programs under six pillars. Pillars for adaptation are comprehensive \ndisaster  management,  infrastructure,  research  and  knowledge  management,  and  capacity \nbuilding. \n \n5.  The impacts of climate change will be particularly severe in remote coastal towns. Firstly, \nthe major challenge in urban areas is the provision of safe water. The worsening incidence of \ndrought is affecting surface water and hand and shallow tube wells, and the situation may \nfurther deteriorate. In the coastal zones, salt water intrusion caused by sea level rise may affect \nthe availability of fresh surface water and groundwater. Consideration should be given to such \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2011\u20132013. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 September 2011. \n ", "2 \nmeasures as conserving and treating water, rainwater harvesting, and monitoring water quality \nand quantity. Secondly, drainage is already a serious problem, as sewers frequently back up in \nthe wet monsoon, especially following intense rainfall. In addition, sea level rise may delay \ndischarge from the drainage system in low-lying areas. Moreover, flooding contaminated by \nwastewater can cause serious health risks. Coastal towns are increasingly vulnerable, and \ndrainage capacity needs to be improved to prevent waterlogging. Implementing water and \nsanitation programs and improving urban drainage in urban areas vulnerable to climate change \nare among priority actions under the BCCSAP. \n \n6.  Coastal towns are in remote areas, where the consequences of climate change are \nexpected to be particularly severe. In 2010, coastal towns had a population of 7 million. Water \nsupply to coastal towns is mainly from groundwater sources drawn from deep and shallow tube \nwells. To cope with current insufficient supply and increasing demand, local government bodies \nplan to build or expand water supply facilities. Especially in coastal areas, all planning and \ndesigns for water supply facilities should include strengthened resilience to climate change.    \n \n7.  Water salinity has increased in and near coastal towns in recent years, recording in 2010 \nthe highest level since 1980. Sea level rise and prolonged dry weather are expected to further \ndrive up salinity in coastal towns. Therefore, future investments in water supply, such as in \nconstructing water-intake and -treatment plants, need to incorporate into their design responses \nto climate change risks. As groundwater is currently the major source of water in the area, \nassessing groundwater resources needs to be done and include investigating the possibility of \nsalinity intrusion in the aquifer.   \n \n8.  Coastal  towns  currently  suffer recurring  and  worsening  waterlogging problems. The \nsituation  can  be  further  exacerbated  by  increased  rainfall  and  sea  level  rise.  Careful \nassessments need to be undertaken on the extent of the impacts, on the bases of which \nappropriate response mechanisms need to be developed.  \n \n9.  The Government of Bangladesh prepared its Strategic Program for Climate Resilience \nwith assistance from ADB, the World Bank, and the International Finance Corporation. The \nprogram was approved by the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) steering committee. \nThis involves $21 million in PPCR grant finance, $50 million in concessionary loans, and $215 \nmillion in ADB loans from the Asian Development Fund. The Coastal Towns Infrastructure \nImprovement Project has been selected as a component of the PPCR. Similarly ADB\u2019s country \noperations  business  plan  for  Bangladesh,  2011\u20132013  also  identifies  the  Coastal  Towns \nInfrastructure Improvement Project, for implementation in 2013. Considering that increased saline \nintrusion in coastal areas has already been reported in the National Adaptation Program of \nAction, and that rainfall intensity will likely increase, future investment projects on urban water \nsupply, drainage, and sanitation need to be climate-proofed. Therefore, the TA will assess the \nimpacts  of  climate  change  on  urban  water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage  systems,  water \navailability, and salinity. The TA will recommend practical and effective options for the location \nof water-intake works, the appropriate design of drainage systems, urban wastewater discharge, \nand the location of sanitation infrastructure. Structural and other options will be identified in the \nTA and prioritized in a participatory manner. The output of the TA will be reflected in the design \nof this future project and other government interventions.    \n \n ", "3   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The main outcome of the capacity development TA will be strengthened capacity in the \nGovernment of Bangladesh to develop climate-resilient urban water, drainage, and sanitation \nprojects in coastal towns. Its result will be guidance for project preparatory TA for the Coastal \nTowns Infrastructure Improvement Project. The impact of the TA will be improved design of \nurban infrastructure projects in coastal towns.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will be implemented in three stages. The first stage will (i) collect existing data \non hydrometeorology, water salinity, and the outputs of various modeling results and analyses \nin selected coastal towns and surroundings; (ii) structure and improve planning in water supply, \nsanitation,  and  drainage;  and  (iii)  collect  socioeconomic  data  such  as  population  density, \npopulation trends, and damage caused by past extreme weather events, as well as data related \nto physical characteristics such as topography, land use, and land subsidence. The second \nstage  will  assess  plausible  climate  scenarios  for  2030  and  2050,  specifically  (i)  reviewing \nexisting structures and future improvement plans for water supply, sanitation, and drainage; (ii) \nreviewing land-use plans and current local practices for coping with climate variability and \nextreme  weather  events,  such  as  early  warning  systems  and  evacuation  plans;  and  (iii) \nconducting hydrological simulation and assessment of flooding, water salinity, and other impacts \non water supply, sanitation, and drainage using mathematical modeling. Assessment results will \nbe presented in a map using geographic information systems. Finally, the TA team will  (i) \nidentify adaptation options, both structural and nonstructural, focusing on urban water supply, \nsanitation, and drainage; (ii) make a preliminary assessment of the feasibility of each option, \nwith due consideration to effectiveness, urgency, associated benefits and costs, and social \nacceptability, as well as identify the agencies responsible for implementation; (iii) prioritize \npreferred options through a participatory approach; and (iv) integrate priority actions into the \ndesigns of future ADB-assisted coastal towns infrastructure improvement projects and other \ngovernment projects and policy actions. \n \n12.   The  TA  will  strengthen  capacity  and  raise  awareness  regarding  climate  change. \nWorkshops and training programs will be carried out mainly for officials of central and local \ngovernment departments and other agencies. Other key stakeholders, such as universities, \nresearch institutes, nongovernment organizations, and the private sector, will be invited to the \nworkshops,  where  the  objectives,  progress,  and  outputs  of  the  TA  will  be  shared  and \ndiscussions  will  prioritize  various  adaptation  options.  Recommendations  based  on  TA \nexperience will be provided for further capacity-building and public-awareness programs, as well \nas for scaling up and replicating interventions in other areas.  \n \n13.  A major risk of the TA arises from (i) the uncertainty of assumptions about greenhouse \ngas emissions trajectories, particularly after mid-century; (ii) differences in results emerging \nfrom the various global climate models; and (iii) the models\u2019 limited ability to simulate all \nimportant climatic processes and sensitivity to initial conditions, among other factors. Even if \nvery high-resolution, local-scaled climate projections were available for the project area, the \nuncertainty problem would remain. There are risks in many respects: \n \n(i)  The quality and quantity of data used for mathematical modeling is a risk, so TA \nconsultants will collect primary data as necessary for model development and \n ", "4 \ncalibration. The most up-to-date data will be utilized, and the appropriateness of \nthe identified scenarios will be ensured by experienced international experts. The \ndegree of uncertainty will be addressed in evaluating various adaptation options \nand  considered  in  prioritization,  which  include  robustness  and  \"no  regrets\" \napproaches that perform well under different scenarios.  \n(ii)  Another risk is a potential delay in prioritizing options, as selection involves value \njudgments and divergent views are expected among stakeholders. To mitigate \nthis risk, the TA will be undertaken in a consultative and participatory manner \nfrom the beginning to foster common understanding and raise awareness, and it \nwill present options in an easily understandable manner to facilitate prioritization. \nThe TA will closely coordinate with other planned project preparatory work to \navoid duplication and ensure that prioritized options are taken up by future ADB-\nfunded  projects  and  other  interventions,  under  the  close  supervision  of  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, other departments of the government, and \nADB.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The Government has requested ADB to finance $700,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \nThe Government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space \nand supplies and workshop venues. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) will be the executing agency, \nand  the  selected  coastal  towns  will  be  the  implementing  agencies. The  LGED  will  assign \ncounterpart staff and ensure the provision of office space, furniture, equipment, and workshop \nvenues by itself and/or with the selected coastal towns. The coastal towns will appoint TA \ncoordinators and technical and counterpart staff to support TA consultants. Centrally, a steering \ncommittee will be headed by the secretary of Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local \nGovernment,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives  and  comprise  senior  officials  from  the \nDepartment  of  Environment,  Economic  Relations  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance, \nBangladesh Water Development Board, LGED, Department of Public Health Engineering, and \nlocal corporations of the selected coastal towns. Having the LGED as the executing agency is \nappropriate  mainly  because  (i)  the  TA\u2019s  geographical  boundary  will  not  be  limited  to  the \njurisdiction of one coastal town, requiring coordination with and support from other towns, and, \n(ii) while the TA is focused on the selected coastal towns, the methodology used and knowledge \nproducts developed, including adaptation options, are expected to be replicated in other areas \nof the country. A working committee will be established, chaired by the chief engineer of the \nLGED and with members from LGED local offices, the selected coastal towns, the Department \nof  Public  Health  Engineering,  and  the  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board.  Resource \npersons and others may participate in the working committee as appropriate.  \n \n16.  The  first  working  committee  meeting  will  be  held  no  later  than  2  weeks  after  the \ncommencement of TA, and the working committee will meet at least once a month to ensure \nsmooth coordination during TA implementation. The steering committee will meet when reports \nhave been submitted by the TA consultants to discuss the progress of TA and provide guidance \nto the TA. As the TA is closely aligned with the BCCSAP, the steering committee is expected to \nserve  as  an  important  vehicle  for  widely  disseminating  TA  progress  and  outputs  among \nstakeholders.     \n ", "5   \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 10 months, from January to October 2012. Consulting \nservices totaling 46 person-months will be required (9 person-months international and 37 \nperson-months national). International expertise will be obtained in climate change adaptation \nand  scenario  assessment,  mathematical  modeling,  and  water  sector  planning.  National \nconsultants will have expertise in geographic information systems; hydraulic, salinity, and urban \ndrainage  modeling;  water  sector  engineering;  hydrogeology;  social  development  and \nparticipation;  urban  planning;  public  health;  and  economic  and  financial  management. \nInternational  consultants  will  supervise  and  coordinate  the  work  of  national  consultants.  In \naddition to consulting services, resource persons may be invited to speak at workshops to \nprovide  the  latest knowledge  on  climate  change  modeling  and  adaptation  planning to key \nstakeholders and the consultants. \n \n18.  The  consultants  and  resource  persons  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will engage \nconsulting  services for the TA  in  one  package. The  international  consultants  and  national \nconsultants will be recruited through a firm, using quality- and cost-based selection, with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20, and using simplified technical proposals. The resource persons will \nbe recruited by single-source selection. Outline terms of reference for consultants and resource \npersons are in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  The team of consultants will submit four major reports: (i) an inception report within 5 \nweeks after TA commencement, (ii) an interim report within 24 weeks, (iii) a draft final report \nwithin 40 weeks, and (iv) a final report 3 weeks after the final workshops organized in Dhaka \nand the selected coastal towns and the receipt of comments from the government and ADB on \nthe draft final report.     \n \n20.  Some equipment, such as computers and printers, will be procured under the TA using \nthe shopping method in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). All equipment purchased under the TA will be handed over to the executing and \nimplementing agencies after TA completion.     \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to the Government \nof Bangladesh, to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, for \nStrengthening the Resilience of the Urban Water Supply, Drainage, and Sanitation to Climate \nChange in Coastal Towns, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n    Data Sources and   \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting   \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved design of urban  Projects submitted for  ADB\u2019s country  Project programmed for \ninfrastructure projects in  PPCR  and ADB funding in  operations business  ADB investment by end of \ncoastal towns   2013   plan   TA implementation \n \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nStrengthened capacity in  Prioritized adaptation  Annual report of LGED   Low turnover of trained \nthe Government of  options taken up by  government staff \nBangladesh to develop  planned investment   \nclimate-resilient urban  projects in coastal towns in  Risks \nwater, drainage, and  2013  Climate change impacts \nsanitation projects in coastal    more severe than expected \ntowns     Government not prioritizing \n    adaptation options in its \ninvestment plans  \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
