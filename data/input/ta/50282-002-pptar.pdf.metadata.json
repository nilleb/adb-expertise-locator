A regional diagnostics assessment of vaccine coverage will be required across Pacific \nDMCs to determine which DMCs would benefit from ADB assistance under the project. The \nGovernments of participating DMCs (as this stage proposed to be Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and \nVanuatu)  will  require  context  specific  support  for  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(PPTA) to prepare the introduction of a new technology and health system intervention.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The main outcomes of the PPTA are to produce a regional diagnostic assessment of \nvaccination  coverage  and  to  prepare  the  project  suitable  for  ADB  financing.  The  regional \ndiagnostic will include a mapping of key stakeholders supporting immunization programs and \nthe additional value of long term ADB investment. The PPTA will also assess the direct and \nindirect economic and health impact of supporting national immunization through a cost benefit \nassessment  of  new  vaccine  introduction,  feasibility  of  bulk  vaccine  purchasing  and  health \nsystem readiness in terms of capacity and institutional arrangements of the MoH in participating \nDMCs.  The  PPTA  will  include  necessary  due  diligence  on  technical,  financial,  economic, \nsafeguards, governance, climate change, poverty and gender issues of the project. \n \n3.

The expert will also prepare, in coordination \nwith other specialists, cost estimates of the proposed project (with detailed cost tables for all \ncomponents  and  activities)  and  a  financing  plan,  taking  into  consideration  cofinancing \nopportunities with development partners and recommend strategies to ensure sustainability and \naccountability of the proposed project. The epidemiologist will prepare an individual profile of \neach  DMC  incorporating  infrastructure  and  capacity  requirements,  approximate  costs  and \nfinancial sustainability of new vaccinations and HPV screening. The consultant will coordinate \nthese works with the health economist and ensure recommendations ensuing will be integrated \ninto the detailed implementation plan.  \n \n7.  Health economist (international, 5 person-months). The consultant will have a post \ngraduate degree in health economics with at least 8 years\u2019 experience in the health sector. The \nhealth economist will undertake a technical assessment and overview of the feasibility and \nrequirements for a successful regional HPV, PCV and RV vaccine procurement and supply \nfocusing on output areas proposed:  \n(i)  assess the economic and financial rationale for potential new vaccine introduction \nproject;  ", "Appendix 3  13 \n \n(ii)  conduct a detailed economic (benefit-cost) analysis of the impacts and outputs of \nthe  potential  project  conducted  from  both  the  government  and  the  societal \nperspective. Both direct and indirect cost components should be considered which \nincludes; vaccine costs, cost of devices (syringes and safety boxes) and equipment \nsuch as expanding the cold chain to store the vaccines, additional program costs, \ncaregiver costs, etc. Other costs such as the loss of productivity from rotavirus, \npneumococcal or cervical cancer disease burden should be looked into, as well as \nthe stress put on the hospital and health system by diarrhea, pneumonia and \ncervical cancer. Benefits should include direct health benefits to the clients and \ncommunity, and also potential benefits to be gained from herd immunity. Other \nbenefits to be included are potential cost savings to the system down the line due \nto these preventative measures and health worker time preserved by preventing \ndisease  transmission,  hospitalization  and,  or  outbreaks.  To  ascertain  the \nrobustness of the analysis, a sensitivity analysis should be conducted with relative \nlevels of uncertainties covered and point estimates given. Also values should be \nadjusted  based  on  amortization  and  discounting  factors.  The  analysis  can  be \nconducted following the ADB\u2019s 10 key areas of Economic Analysis. \n(iii)    Conduct  a  financial  sustainability  analysis  to  determine  the  level  of  available \nresources  for  the  government  to  manage  any  recurrent  costs  of  the  project \ninvestment.
