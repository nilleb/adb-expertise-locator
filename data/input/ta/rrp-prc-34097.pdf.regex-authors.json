An environmental impact assessment was undertaken, and the \nAssessment  summary was circulated to the Board on 29 May 2002. \n   \nProject  The Project is located in Shanxi, a relatively poor midwestern province of the \nDescription  PRC with a per capita gross domestic product (2000) at 61% of the national \naverage. The Project will (i) construct a new expressway and a bridge over \nthe Yellow River (Huang He); (ii) improve local roads servicing poor counties \nand townships; and (iii) provide consulting services and training to enhance \nconstruction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions  control,  and  project \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  project  expressway  supports  the  PRC's \nWestern Region Development Strategy, which aims to promote economic \ngrowth, reduce development disparities between the western and coastal \nregions, and improve natural resources management. \n   \nRationale  The Project supports the national trunk highway system, one of the important \npriorities of the PRC Government. It is a system of interprovincial expressways \nand high-class highways of about 35,000 kilometers (km), to be constructed \nover a 20-year period up to 2010. The PRC road network is underdeveloped in \nboth quality and extent with less than 3% classified as expressways or Class I \nhighways, and about 14% as Class II highways. Large parts of the country, \nparticularly  poor  inland  areas  such  as  Shanxi  Province,  do  not  have \ndeveloped roads, restricting access to markets and social services.  Thus, \nroad development is a key component in the Government\u2019s strategy to provide \nneeded infrastructure to facilitate economic growth and reduce poverty through \nimproved access to markets and services.  \n   \nThe  proposed  expressway  will  (i) serve  part  of  the  vital  Taiyuan-Xi'an \nCorridor (Inner Mongolia to Yunnan Province, 3,610 km) of the national trunk \nhighway system, passing through several cities in different provinces; (ii) \nreduce congestion on national highway G108; (iii) serve as an important link \nto  other  neighboring  provinces  by  acting  as  a  catalyst  in  promoting \ninterprovincial  trade  and  fostering  new  economic  activities  through  the \nconstruction of the Yellow River Bridge; (iv) improve the rural poor\u2019s access \nto effective means of transport for meeting livelihood needs by enhancing \nmobility and linking poor areas to growth centers providing market access, \nemployment opportunities, and better social services by expanding local \nroads; (v) improve efficiency of both road passenger and freight operations \nand  reduce  transport  costs,  congestion,  noise,  accidents,  and  vehicle \nemissions;  (vi)  promote  private  sector  investments  from  domestic  and \ninternational sources by improving road accessibility; and (vii) boost further \ninvestments in Shanxi, which will create demand for goods and services \nprovided by the people in remote areas. \n ", "iv   \n  Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy dialogue  with the Government  has \nconsistently been a feature of road projects in  the PRC, in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s road subsector policy reform. ADB dialogue has centered on: \nimpacts on the poor, road design standards and construction quality, road \nsafety, vehicle emissions, road pricing, corporatization, commercialization, \nfinance, and resource mobilization.  Policy dialogue is integrated in ADB\u2019s \ntechnical assistance and loan activities in the PRC. \n   \nObjectives and  The main objectives of the Project are (i) to promote economic development \nScope  in the project area; and (ii) to reduce poverty in Shanxi Province, particularly \nthrough sustaining economic growth benefits in poor counties and townships \nby improving accessibility to markets in rural areas. The Project comprises \nthe following components:  (i) expressway and bridges\u2014construction of  a \n65 km  four-lane  access-controlled  toll  expressway  from  Houma  to \nYumenkou,  Shanxi;  Yellow  River  Bridge  (4.5 km)  and  toll  station;  four \ninterchanges;  11  large  bridges;  and  one  service  area;  (ii)  local  roads\u2014\nimprovement of about 70 km of local roads, which includes rebuilding 5 km of \nlocal link roads in Xinjiang county and 15 km of local roads in Jishan to meet \nClass II highway standards; upgrading 20 km of village roads in Xinjiang \ncounty  and  30 km  of  local  county  roads  in  Hejin  to  Class  III highway \nstandards;  and  reconstructing  two  bridges  across  the  Fenhe and Fenxi \nrivers, Jishan county; about $2 million of the ADB loan will be provided for \nthe  local  roads  component;  (iii)  equipment  for  road  maintenance,  toll \ncollection, surveillance and communications, load testing, road safety, and \noffice  administration;  (iv)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (v) \nconsulting services for construction supervision, monitoring and evaluation, \nroad  safety  audits,  and  in-country  and  international  training  for  capacity \nbuilding. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies and \ninterest during construction, is estimated at $326.8 million (CNY2,705 million \nequivalent),  of  which  about  $155.9 million  (47.7%)  will  be  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $170.9 million  equivalent  (52.3%)  will  be  the  local \ncurrency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan   \n  ($ million) \n    Foreign  Local  Total \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n         \n  Asian Development Bank  124.0  0  124.0 \n  Ministry of Communications Grant  0.0  56.8  56.8 \n  Shanxi Provincial Government Funds  31.9  65.8  97.7 \n  China Minsheng Bank Loan  0.0  48.3  48.3 \n         \n    Total  155.9  170.9  326.8 \n    %  47.7  52.3  100.0 \n ", "  v\n \nLoan Amount  A loan of $124 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be provided \nand Terms  under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. \nThe loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 4 years, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements. \n   \nAllocation and  The ADB loan proceeds will be relent by the Borrower to Shanxi Province. \nRelending  Shanxi Province will onlend a portion of the loan proceeds in an amount of \nTerms  $122  million  to  the  Shanxi  Hou-yu  Expressway  Construction  Company \nLimited (SHEC) on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \nSHEC will bear the interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks for the \namount of the loan proceeds onlent thereto. Shanxi Province will keep the \nbalance of $2 million to be used for the local roads component and it will bear \nthe interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks for this amount. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 31 July 2007 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated  31 January 2007 \nProject \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting  Shanxi Communications Department (SCD) \nAgency \n   \nImplementation  SCD established SHEC for project expressway construction, operation, and \nArrangements  maintenance in October 2001. SHEC will be the project implementation \nagency to coordinate and monitor all project expressway activities. The local \nroad program will be implemented by the county communications bureaus, \nunder the supervision of SCD. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in \naccordance  with  the  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  International \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) will be the basis for awarding: (i) ADB-financed civil \nworks contracts in respect of the project expressway estimated to cost the \nequivalent of $5,000,000 or more; (ii) each civil works contract for local roads \ncomponent of the Project to be financed by the Loan estimated to cost the \nequivalent of $2,500,000 or more; and (ii) supply contracts estimated to cost \nmore than $500,000. Local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures will be \nused for: (i) each civil works contract for the project expressway estimated to \ncost the equivalent of less than $5,000,000; (ii) each civil works contract for \nlocal roads component of the Project to be financed by the Loan estimated to \ncost the equivalent of less than $2,500,000; (iii), and civil works contracts to \nbe  financed  by  the  Government.  LCB  procedures  or  government \nprocurement procedures may be used for building and ancillary facilities \nfinanced by the Government. Supply contracts estimated to cost $100,000 or \nless each may be under direct procurement. Civil works for local roads which \nare scattered in various locations may be carried out by SCD on a force \naccount  basis.  The  Government  requested  ADB's  approval  for  advance \naction for procurement and approval was granted in June 2002. Advance ", "vi   \naction for procurement and approval was granted in June 2002. Advance \nprocurement action covers prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid \nevaluation for civil works contract packages, excluding signing of contracts.  \n   \nConsulting  SHEC will establish five resident supervision offices, staffed with domestic \nServices  consulting firms selected by SHEC, to directly supervise construction work in \nthe field. Overall supervision will be under the responsibility of the Chief \nSupervision Engineer Office, to which international consultants will be fully \nintegrated.  A  chief  supervision  engineer  (CSE)  and  two  deputy  chief \nsupervision engineers will head the Chief Supervision Engineer Office. One \ndeputy chief supervision engineer will be the team leader of the international \nconsultants and will assist the CSE in project and contract management \nactivities, and certify contractors\u2019 progress payment certificates and contract \nvariations prior to their approval by the CSE. International consultants will \nprovide  services  in  construction  supervision,  environmental  monitoring, \nresettlement monitoring and evaluation, poverty reduction monitoring, safety \naudit of the project design, project performance management systems, road \nsafety  and  vehicle  emissions  monitoring,  training,  and  monitoring \nsocioeconomic performance indicators on poverty townships and villages. \n \nA  total  of  about  38  person-months  of  consultants  from  an  international \nconsulting company will be required for international consulting services. \nInternational consultants will be financed under the loan, and recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. In addition, the \nProject will require 2,300 person-months of domestic consultants. Domestic \nconsultants will be financed by SHEC and recruited in accordance with \ngovernment procedures satisfactory to ADB. \n   \nProject Benefits  The Project will foster new economic activities and reduce poverty. The \nand  benefits from the Project include stimulating economic growth, promoting \nBeneficiaries  investments,  increasing  access  to  markets  and  information,  creating  job \nopportunities, and increasing incomes of the project area\u2019s population. The \neconomic benefits arising from the Project include: vehicle operating cost \nand  time  savings,  benefits  from  generated  traffic,  savings  from  avoided \naccidents, savings to freight in transit, and avoided vehicle emissions. The \neconomic internal rate of return is estimated at 16.2%. The financial internal \nrate of return is 7.6%, which is higher than the real weighted average cost of \ncapital of 3.7%.  \n \nBenefits  to  the  poor  will  largely  be  in  terms  of  increased  economic \nopportunities from the expressway, and social gains from the local road \ncomponent and the implementation of a social development action plan. It is \nestimated that the Project will directly benefit 48,400 persons (4.8% of the \nproject area\u2019s population) below the poverty line of CNY1,000 and CNY3,000 \nannual per capita income for rural and urban areas, respectively. Residents \nin the project area,  and farmers and rural households served by the local \nroads, as well as the urban poor are identified as the groups most likely to \nreceive both direct income and non-income (access) benefits. An estimated \n5,200 and 19,480 person-years of unskilled and skilled labor, respectively, \nwill be generated from project construction, and 395 permanent positions for \noperations.  Through  improved  accessibility,  an  increase  in  incremental \nincome is expected for those whose access to rural roads will be improved. \nThough there has been much agricultural development in recent years, land ", "  vii \nThough there has been much agricultural development in recent years, land \nand water resources are almost fully utilized. Thus, agriculture alone cannot \nprovide income levels above the poverty line. For the past 5 years, the region \nhas had  success in  reducing poverty, due largely to increased economic \nactivities. The project expressway will be a major catalyst  in keeping the \nregion  competitive  (in  terms  of  production  and  transport  costs),  thereby \nensuring longer-term employment opportunities and preventing people from \nfalling back into  poverty. ADB approved  a resettlement plan prepared by \nSHEC in May 2002. \n   \nRisks and  The Project has been formulated to reduce potential technical and economic \nAssumptions  risks.  \n \nThe main technical risks, which could result in implementation delays are \nassociated with the construction of the Yellow River Bridge and 11 other \nlarge bridges. To mitigate these risks, consultants have thoroughly reviewed \nthe  proposed  construction  methods.  During  construction, monitoring and \ncontract management information systems will be set up and implemented \nwith the assistance  of the consultants for timely identification of technical \nproblems  and  implementation  of  corrective  measures.  SCD  has  proven \nexperience and is satisfactorily implementing similar projects, including the \nShanxi Road Development Project for which a $250 million ADB loan was \napproved in September 1999.  \n \nThere are no major environmental and resettlement risks and adequate \nmitigation and monitoring mechanisms have been built into the Project. The \nproposed Yellow River Bridge is 2.5 km from the northern border of the \noriginal Hejin Gray Crane Wintering Ground Nature Reserve and 4 km from \nthe reserve\u2019s core zone boundary. These distances are adequate to ensure \nthat there  will  be  no  disturbance to wintering cranes  from the proposed \nbridge  construction  and  operation.  Protective  measures  for  gray  crane \nhabitats  and  a  comprehensive  soil  erosion  control  plan  were  developed \nunder the guidance of the State Environmental Protection Administration, \nMinistry of Water Resources, Shanxi Environmental Protection Bureau, and \nShanxi Forestry Department. Additional equipment will be procured, and \ntraining and capacity building will be undertaken to ensure the sustainability \nof the ecosystems. These costs are included in the project cost. The State \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has approved the environmental impact \nassessment and soil erosion control plan for the Project. \n \nWhile a financial risk is associated with construction and operation of the \nexpressway, its extent will depend upon the actual construction costs. To \nmitigate this risk, SHEC is consciously oriented to building up a commercial \nbusiness  environment  for  expressway  operations,  and  the  project \nexpressway will receive substantial equity injections from the central and \nprovincial governments. As the Project will generate revenue in domestic \ncurrency, there is a risk related to exchange rate changes. Sensitivity tests \nindicate that an adverse exchange rate change will have only a limited effect \non the financial internal rate of return. \n ", " ", " ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shanxi Road Development II Project. The \nproject framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The Government continues to have a multipronged approach to development. Road \ndevelopment is a key component in the development strategy to improve access to markets and \nservices. The government policies for road development are based on the following principles: \n(i) constructing expressways to expand the national trunk highway system (NTHS) to link all \ncities with a population of more than 500,000; (ii) developing secondary roads, particularly those \nthat  will  help  reduce  poverty  and  promote  rural  markets;  (iii) promoting  trade,  economic \nactivities, commerce, and other sociocultural links among various provinces; and (iv) building \nroads  that  will  support  regional  cooperation  with  neighboring  countries  in  the  southwest, \nnortheast, and northwest. In the PRC, the heart of the road network is the NTHS, a system of \ninterprovincial expressways and high-class highways of about 35,000 kilometers (km), to be \nconstructed over a 20-year period up to 2010 (Map 1). As part of a multipronged approach to \nroad sector development, the Government\u2019s strategy also includes the development of local \nroads. These are consistent with the Western Region Development Strategy, which is a key \ntheme of the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005). This Strategy aims to promote economic growth, \nreduce disparities between the western1 and coastal regions, and improve environmental and \nnatural resources management. The road sector forms an important part of this Strategy as it \nprovides a vital link between the western and coastal regions. The Project will support the \nGovernment's NTHS and the Strategy, as part of an important artery of the Taiyuan-Xi'an \ncorridor. Detailed analyses of the road subsector and ongoing policy reforms in the subsector \nare given in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) operational strategy2 in the PRC\u2019s road subsector \nsupports (i) construction of roads that connect major growth centers and promote linkages with \nhinterland economies; (ii) integration of the network so that the NTHS is supported by a system \nof local roads, particularly those that provide access to poor areas; (iii) promotion of road safety; \n(iv) institutional  strengthening  to  increase  the  commercial  orientation  and  efficiency  of \nexpressway organizations; (v) improvement of highway planning and evaluation techniques; \n(vi) adoption of appropriate pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport capacity; \nand  (vii) use  of  alternative  methods  of  investment  financing,  including  private  sector \nparticipation. The strategy reflects an integrated approach for the development of the road \nsector by considering not only expressway and highway systems, but also local roads servicing \npoorer segments of the population.  \n \n4.   External assistance to the road subsector has come mainly from ADB, Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC),  and  the  World  Bank.  Since  1985,  the  World  Bank  has \nprovided about $5.3 billion to finance 22 highway projects and six urban transport projects. JBIC \nhas provided about $990 million equivalent for six bridge projects and five highway projects in \nthe NTHS. Since 1991, ADB has provided 21 loans totaling nearly $3.9 billion to finance \n3,115 km of highway development, together with the associated 5,042 km local road network, \n                                                 \n1  Consisting of 12 provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities: Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Xizang, \nSichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, and one prefecture in Jilin, Hubei, and \nHunan provinces. \n2  ADB. 2002. People's Republic of China: Country Strategy and Program Update (2003-2005). ", "2  \n \nand two loans totaling $155 million for bridges in Shanghai. ADB has also provided the road \nsubsector with 24 project preparatory technical assistance (TA) grants totaling $11.1 million and \n20 advisory TA grants totaling $12.0 million. The advisory TAs have supported the development \nof road infrastructure by addressing policy and institutional issues, including highway planning, \nroad  safety,  human  resources  development,  transport  pricing,  commercialization  and \ncorporatization,  and  mobilization  of  nongovernment  financial  resources.  Problems  and \nconstraints analysis is given in Appendix 2. ADB's future program for 2003\u20132005 includes seven \nprojects for which ADB aims to provide $1.8 billion in financing. The proposed expressway will \nconstruct an important link crossing over the Yellow River (Huang He) to the ongoing Shaanxi \nRoads Development Project.3 The Shaanxi Roads Development loan was signed on 10 June \n2002 and the procurement process is ongoing. A summary of external assistance to the sector \nis given in Appendix 3. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s experience in the PRC road subsector has shown that the PRC technical staff \nhave adequate capabilities for design and construction supervision, and local contractors have \nproven competence in construction and maintenance. However, the PRC needs to acquire \nexpertise in modern construction methods for long tunnels, large bridges, and flexible pavement \ndesign; modern operation methods for toll collections; and managerial skills of roads and related \ninstitutions, environmental protection, and commercial business practices. The use of ADB loan \nand TA funds to upgrade the capabilities of executing agencies (EAs) in previous projects has \ncontributed  to  improved  project  quality.  However,  to  meet  implementation  schedules,  the \nbidding process and construction quality have sometimes been compromised. Insufficient time \nallowed for soil settlement may have adversely affected pavement quality. ADB has taken these \nmatters up as part of the policy dialogue. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n6.  The  PRC  road  network  is  underdeveloped  in  both  quality  and  extent.  Despite \nconsiderable investments in recent years, expressways and Class I highways still account for \nless than 3% of the total road network, and Class II highways for about 14%.4 The remaining \n83% are medium- to low-grade paved roads and gravel roads. Large parts of the country, \nparticularly the poor inland areas, including those in Shanxi Province, do not have access to \nmarkets and adequate social infrastructure. These observations were confirmed during public \nconsultations that were carried out during project preparation. A chronology is given in Appendix \n4 and more details are given in Supplementary Appendix B. Due to the rapid growth of the PRC \neconomy since 1978, the demand for transport services has increased many fold. Furthermore, \nthe number of privately owned motor vehicles in the PRC increased more than 20 times during \n1985\u20132000, from 0.3 to 6.3 million vehicles. However, the country\u2019s transport capacity is still \nvery limited. Thus, serious constraints remain, especially in the road subsector. As a major \nelement in the integrated approach to road development, local roads have been included in the \nproject scope. This also makes ADB\u2019s intervention in the road subsector more effective in terms \nof poverty reduction (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n7.  The PRC's road investment needs from 1996 to 2010 are estimated at $504 billion. \nAvailable revenues are estimated at $302 billion from road user charges, and $29 billion from \ntoll collections, leaving a financing gap of $173 billion or about $12 billion per year. Consistent \nwith ADB's policy dialogue, the Government is creating a framework to attract private sector \nfinance for road construction. While the private sector is willing to participate under concession \nagreements, or in refinancing, leasing, and securitization, it has been difficult to finance build-\noperate-transfer (BOT) type projects, which entail the private sector taking the initial risks of \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n4  The Shanxi highway transportation infrastructure is also underdeveloped. Its expressway length accounts for about \n0.9% of its total road network. ", "  3\n \nconstruction and traffic demand. Private sector financing is most likely to be available to finance \nabout 5% of the high-grade and provincial road networks. More details about nongovernment \nfinancing and road sector revenues are given in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n8.  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy and the Government\u2019s \npolicies and strategies. It reflects an integrated approach to road transport sector development \nas a component of overall economic development. It will connect economic growth centers in \nShanxi, through the expressway and bridges component, and support the development of local \nroads that will provide the local poor with access to economic centers. The Project will serve as \na vital part of the Taiyuan-Xi'an corridor of the NTHS. It connects to the 176 km Qixian-Linfen \nExpressway under Loan 1701-PRC: Shanxi Road Development Project through the 40 km \nLinfen-Houma Expressway (financed by the local government), which is expected to open to \ntraffic in December 2002. The Project also links to the 176 km Yumenkou-Yanliang Expressway \nunder Loan 1838-PRC: Shaanxi Roads Development Project. Therefore, once the proposed 65 \nkm Houma-Yumenkou Expressway, including the Yellow River Bridge under the Project, is built, \nabout 457 km of the Taiyuan-Xi'an corridor, from Qixian in Shanxi to Yanliang in Shaanxi, will be \ncompleted (Map 2).  \n \n9.  As a result of recent rapid economic growth, between 1990 and 2000 road passenger \ntraffic in Shanxi increased from 5.9 billion to 13.6 billion passenger-km. This corresponds to an \naverage annual growth rate of 8.7%. Road freight traffic in Shanxi Province increased from \n11.5 billion to 27.0 billion ton-km, or an average annual growth rate of 8.9% over the same \nperiod. In contrast, the national growth rates were 9.7% and 5.9%, respectively, over the same \nperiod. Keeping abreast with the 20-fold national increase, privately owned motor vehicles in \nShanxi totaled about 235,078 in 2000.  Increased demand for transport services has not been \nmatched by expansion in the road subsector. Two railroads are currently operating in the project \narea: the South Tong-Pu Railway and the Huo-Xi Railroad. The Hou-Xi Railroad, running from \nHouma to Xi'an in Shaanxi Province, is parallel to the project expressway. These do not, \nthough, meet the expanding transport requirements. The Hou-Xi Railroad carried 2.2 million \npassengers and 8.2 million tons of freight in 1996. \n \n10.  Despite the rapid increase in the total number of vehicles, Shanxi has only about 1.7 \nvehicles (trucks, cars, or buses) for 100 persons. Modernization of the vehicle fleet is needed to \nimprove vehicle safety and reduce fuel consumption and vehicle emissions. In Shanxi, road \nmaintenance fees and domestic borrowing are major financing sources for the budget. An \nincreasing proportion of provincial road budgets is being used to meet the national priority for \nexpressway and highway construction.  Given the PRC's rapid economic growth and vehicle \nownership, both the public and private vehicle fleets are expected to continue to grow rapidly in \nthe coming years. In Shanxi, annual traffic volume growth in 2000\u20132001 was about 9.4%, with a \nrising trend. This will result in substantial increases in the volume of road traffic and mounting \ncongestion.  \n \n11.  ADB has been actively involved in policy dialogue on the PRC road subsector since \n1991. Recently, the principal issues addressed include the poverty reduction impact of road \nprojects, highway design standards and construction quality, road safety, vehicle emissions, \npricing  policies,  commercialization  and  corporatization,  and  nongovernment  financing \nresources. The current status and achievements to date are summarized in the Road Subsector \nPolicy Reform Plan. The Plan and a summary of the road sector analysis are given in Appendix \n5. \n \n12.  ADB evaluation shows high levels of performance for ongoing transport projects and \nTAs in the PRC. The maintenance of roads completed under ADB-financed projects has not \nbeen a problem in the country. An effective budgetary allocation system is in place, and strong \ninstitutional capacity to maintain the expressway system has been developed. Recent TAs have ", "4  \n \nbeen instrumental in focusing the Government's attention on the need to expand its sources of \nfinance for highway development, as well as on the institutional, policy, and regulatory issues \nthat need to be addressed to facilitate the use of a broader set of modalities for domestic and \nforeign resource mobilization. An ADB-financed study helped the Government identify road \nprojects and capacity-building activities in the southwest region for implementation during the \n10th Five-Year Plan period. This shift in policy direction is in line with ADB's strategic objective of \nreducing poverty in inland provinces.  \n \n13.  By maintaining dialogue integral to TA and loan activities, ADB has ensured that its \noperations are consistent with the Government's road subsector policy reform. Hence the \nProject adds dimension to the traditional road project concept. Through an integrated approach, \nit brings the usual benefits associated with a road project. It will improve the efficiency of both \nroad passenger and freight operations through reducing  transport costs, traffic congestion, \ntraffic noise, traffic accidents, and vehicle emissions, and through increasing service frequency. \nThrough the local roads component, it will also improve access of the poor to effective means of \ntransport  for  meeting  their  livelihood  needs  through  enhancing  the  mobility  of  poor  rural \nhouseholds, thereby increasing market opportunities and social services (such as access of the \nsick and injured to health facilities). It will also boost investments, since lack of roads and poor \naccessibility are among the most frequently cited impediments faced by international and \ndomestic sources to invest in poor interior provinces.5  \n \n14.  An integrated approach extends these benefits and brings the Project into the larger \ndevelopment needs of the province and the region. The Project goes beyond the project area by \nproviding a vital link to the rest of the country through both its expressway and local roads \ncomponents. It will facilitate interprovincial trade, improve transport services in urban areas, and \nconnect poorer rural areas to vital growth corridors. It will connect people from two provinces, \nthrough the Yellow River Bridge component, resulting in the revival of social and cultural links \nwhile promoting economic development. The Project also brings technology, evident in the \nYellow River Bridge being the largest ADB-financed bridge in the PRC using state-of-the-art \nconstruction skills and technologies, thereby raising standards in road projects. In view of the \nneed for institutional strengthening, the Project will endorse capacity building in construction \nsupervision,  project  quality  control,  road  safety  measures,  and  performance  monitoring \nactivities. The Project integrates road and transport development into the broader context of \neconomic and human development, by increasing access and connectivity between areas, \npeoples, and ideas.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n15.  Shanxi Province is a relatively poor interior province located in the midwestern part of  \nthe PRC. Shanxi had around 1.7 million rural poor by the end of 2000, based on an annual \nincome of CNY1,000 per person. This accounts for about 7.5% of the rural population of Shanxi \nprovince of 22.7 million.6 In 2000, the average gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in \nShanxi  was  CNY4,285,  or  about  61%  of  the  national  average  (CNY7,079).  Since  1980, \neconomic growth in Shanxi has, at an average of 9.2% per annum, been slightly lower than the \nnational  average  of  10.1%  per  annum.  The  Project  will  reduce  transport  costs,  promote \neconomic development, and reduce poverty through improved rural activities and employment \ngeneration in the project area. As a result of the ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, the scope of the Project \nhas been expanded to strengthen its development impact through a local roads component to \nimprove the access of poor communities in the project area. The Project involves building an \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002. Private Sector Assessment in the PRC (draft). Manila.  \n6  The total population of Shanxi province is estimated at 32.5 million in 2000. ", "  5\n \nintegrated road system in Shanxi (Map 2), which will benefit about 1 million people in the project \narea in addition to the traffic users. As a single source, the main economic activity in the project \narea  is  agriculture.  Production  of  construction  materials,  small-scale  industries,  coking, \nmetallurgical industries, and commerce also contribute to economic output in the project area. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n16.  The scope of the Project includes: \n \n(i)  Expressway  and  Bridge  Component.  Construction  of  a  65 km  four-lane \naccess-controlled toll expressway from Houma to Yumenkou in Shanxi including \nconstruction of a 4,566-meter (m) long Yellow River Bridge and construction of \nfour interchanges with four toll stations, a toll station on the Yellow River Bridge, \n11 large bridges, and one service area. \n \n(ii)  Local Roads Component. Improvement of 70 km of local roads, which includes \nrebuilding 5 km of local link roads in Xinjiang county and 15 km of local roads in \nJishan to meet Class II highway standards, upgrading 20 km of village roads in \nXinjiang county and 30 km of local county roads in Hejin to Class III highway \nstandards, and reconstructing two bridges (300 m and 350 m) across the Fenhe \nand Fenxi rivers, Jishan county (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \n(iii)  Equipment Component. Procurement of equipment for road maintenance, toll \ncollection, surveillance and communications, load testing, ecological monitoring, \nsoil erosion control, and office administration. \n \n(iv)  Land Component. Land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n(v)  Consulting  Services  Component.  Construction  supervision,  environmental \nmonitoring,  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation,  poverty  reduction  impact \nmonitoring,  safety  audit,  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS) \nincluding socioeconomic performance indicators, vehicle emissions monitoring, \nand in-country and international training for capacity building. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Asian Development Bank Loan to the Local Roads Component \n \n17.  To  ensure  an  integrated  approach  to  road  development,  the  Project  includes  the \nimprovement of about 70 km of local roads. The total cost of the local roads component is \nestimated  at  approximately  $13.2 million  (CNY109.9 million  equivalent),  of  which  about \n$2.5 million (19%) will be the foreign exchange cost and $10.7 million equivalent (81%) is the \nlocal currency cost. For the local roads component, about $2 million will be provided under the \nADB loan. \n \n2.  Monitoring of Socioeconomic Impact \n \n18.  To enhance the poverty reduction impact of the Project, it was agreed by SPG that (i) all \nroads financed under the Project, i.e., the expressway and the local roads, would utilize wage \nlabor, with wages being set at market rates for unskilled labor; and (ii) construction companies \ninvolved in civil works for the Project would commit to hiring the highest possible share of the \nlabor  force  from  poor  villages.  Labor  teams  would  be  identified  by  the  Shanxi  Hou-yu \nExpressway Construction Company Limited (SHEC) and local contractors by way of agreement \nto ensure the maximum employment of unskilled poor workers in the project area, under the ", "6  \n \nsupervision of an external monitoring agency. Socioeconomic effects and poverty reduction \nimpacts  of  the  Project  will  be  monitored  during  and  after  implementation.  Shanxi \nCommunications  Department  (SCD)/SHEC  will  engage  4  person-months  of  international \nmonitoring specialist (2 for the expressway and 2 for the local roads component) and a domestic \nfirm or academic institution for a total of 10 person-months to monitor project impacts and \nassess the changes in socioeconomic conditions in poor areas and counties. Socioeconomic \ndata will be collected and analyzed according to the indicators suggested in the PPMS. The \nimpact  of  the  Project  on  poverty  reduction  will  be  evaluated  during  and  after  project \nimplementation. Socioeconomic data will be collected and analyzed according to the indicators \nsuggested in the PPMS. \n \n3.  Corporatization and Corporate Governance  \n \n19.  Corporatization in the road sector is an important part of ADB's policy dialogue with the \nGovernment  to  encourage  the  separation  of  construction  and  operations  from  provincial \ngovernment functions. It is also the Government\u2019s policy to corporatize expressway operations \nand,  in  line  with  this  policy,  SHEC  was  established  in  October  2001  for  the  purpose  of \nconstruction, maintenance, and operations of the project expressway. SHEC is a limited liability \ncompany governed by PRC company law. As a government-owned company, it has a board of \ndirectors  comprising  a  chairperson  and  four  other  members  to  decide  on  corporate  and \nmanagement  matters.  A  general  manager  and  several  vice  general  managers  will  be \nresponsible  for  its  daily  operation  in  accordance  with  its  charter.  Corporatization  is  being \nimplemented successfully under the first Shanxi Road Development Project.7 Shanxi Province \nand SHEC will also sign a project expressway construction, operation and maintenance (O&M), \nand  management  concession  framework  agreement  to  (i) establish  a  formal  relationship \nbetween SCD and the expressway company; (ii) ensure autonomy of operation; (iii) encourage \nestablishment  of  road  facility  performance  indicators;  and  (iv) facilitate  future  refinancing, \nprivatization, and securitization of the project expressway (Supplementary Appendix F). The \nproject  expressway  operation,  revenue  collection,  and  debt  service  obligations  will  be \ntransferred  to  SHEC  in  accordance  with  the  concession  agreement  and  the  onlending \nagreement. By 31 December 2004 a corporate development plan will be formulated by SHEC, \nand submitted to ADB, to achieve the objectives of (i) operating SHEC on commercial basis, \n(ii) improving its efficiency, and (iii) ensuring its operation in compliance with its charter and \ncompany law (Supplementary Appendix G). \n \n4.  Construction Supervision \n \n20.  For better construction supervision, a chief supervision engineer office (CSEO) will be \nestablished in SHEC. The chief supervision engineer (CSE) will be supported by two deputy \nchief supervision engineers (DCSEs). One DCSE will be the team leader of the international \nconsultants and will assist the CSE in project and contract management activities, and certify \ncontractor progress payments and contract variations prior to their approval by the CSE. This \narrangement was started in the ongoing Shanxi Road Development Project successfully. The \ninternational consultants will supervise construction during the winter to ensure implementation \nof the protection measures and action plans for protection of the wintering gray cranes near the \nYellow River Bridge area.  \n \n5.  Yellow River Bridge \n \n21.  The geological conditions of the riverbed of the Yellow River require special treatment on \nthe design of bridge foundations. For the bridge itself, four types of bridges were considered. \nAfter careful evaluation of the alternatives during the feasibility study and design stage, a \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 1999.

This will allow SCD to use state-of-the-art \ntechnologies and skills for bridge construction. The estimated construction period of the bridge \nis about 42 months, costing approximately CNY731 million or $88.3 million equivalent. \n \n6.  Resettlement Plan \n \n22.  Consistent  with  the  1998  Land  Administration  Law,8  which  requires  disclosure  of \ninformation and consultation with affected persons, a resettlement information booklet, together \nwith  provincial  compensation  rates,  was  distributed  to  affected  villages  and  persons  and \npublicized in the local media on 25 April 2002. The resettlement information booklet contains \nsections on resettlement impacts, the resettlement policy, compensation rates and policies, \norganizational  arrangements,  consultation  and  participation,  and  grievance  procedures. \nFeedback from affected persons was received and reviewed by SCD and ADB to ensure that \nany further concerns should be addressed. Based on these, a resettlement plan was submitted \nto ADB on 10 May 2002. ADB approved the resettlement plan and it was provided to county \noffices in August 2002. A detailed measurement survey will be undertaken after approval of the \npreliminary  design  report,  and  38  affected  villages  will  participate  in  the  preparation  of \nrehabilitation  plans  for  land  readjustments  and  income  restoration.  Additional  information \nincluding village rehabilitation plans will be approved by the county resettlement offices and \nforwarded  to  ADB  for  its  concurrence.  Land  acquisition  will  start  only  after  that.  Local \ngovernment will be responsible for implementing the resettlement plan, including measures for \nlivelihood and income rehabilitation of all affected people. A summary resettlement plan has \nbeen prepared and is given in Appendix 6, and details are given in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n23.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  approximately  $326.8 million \n(CNY2,705 million equivalent) including about $13.2 million of the local roads component, of \nwhich about $155.9 million (47.7%) is the foreign exchange cost and $170.9 million equivalent \n(52.3%) is the local currency cost. The total cost also includes taxes, price escalation, physical \ncontingencies, and interest and other charges during construction.

Technical Assistance to PRC for Capacity Building for Natural Resources Legislation. Manila. ", "8  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n24.  SCD had initially requested ADB to provide a loan of $150 million, but this amount was \nlowered  to  $124 million  during  project  processing,  in  line  with  more  detailed  project  cost \nestimates. The loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year term \nincluding a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of \n1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \nThe ADB loan proceeds will be re-lent by the Borrower to Shanxi Province, a portion of which in \nan amount of $122 million will be onlent to SHEC on the same terms and conditions as those of \nthe ADB  loan. SHEC will bear the interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks for the \namount of the loan proceeds onlent thereto. Shanxi province will retain the balance of $2 million \nof loan proceeds for development of local roads. The Government, through the Ministry of \nCommunications (MOC), SCD, and a domestic bank (China Minsheng Bank [CMB]) will finance \nthe remaining project cost. The CMB loan will be $48.3 million (CNY400 million) and will be \npayable over 15 years, including a grace period of 4 years, at a variable lending rate, currently \nabout 6.2% per annum. A financing plan is shown in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local    % of \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total  Total \nADB loan  124.0  0.0  124.0  37.9 \nMOC   0.0  56.8  56.8  17.4 \nShanxi Government Funds  31.9  65.8  97.7  29.9 \nCMB loan  0.0  48.3  48.3  14.8 \nTotal  155.9  170.9  326.8  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MOC = Ministry of Communications, CMB = China Minsheng Bank. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n25.  SCD  will  be  the  EA  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the  Project.  SCD \nestablished SHEC for project expressway construction and O&M in October 2001. SHEC will be \nthe project implementation agency to coordinate and monitor all project expressway activities. \nSHEC is headed by a chairperson and has five departments. SHEC's general manager will be \nthe project director responsible for overall management of the project expressway component. \nThe local roads component will be implemented by the county communications bureaus, under \nthe supervision of SCD. Organization charts of SCD and SHEC are given in Supplementary \nAppendix I. To facilitate land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental protection measures, \nand  to  ensure  that  local  concerns  are  adequately  addressed,  project  implementation \ncommittees of local officials will be established in the Henjin, Jishan, and Xinjiang counties. In \naddition,  under  the  CSE,  five  resident  offices  will  be  established  in  the  field.  Project \nadministration  issues  were  discussed  during  the  appraisal  mission  and  a  draft  project \nadministration memorandum was given to SCD and SHEC (Supplementary Appendix J). \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n26.  Preconstruction activities of ADB-financed works, such as detailed design, preparation of \nbidding documents, prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid evaluation of contracts \nbegan in May 2002 and will be completed by May 2003. Overall project construction, including \nthe Yellow River Bridge, is scheduled to start in August 2003 and take about 42 months, the ", "  9\n \nanticipated completion date being January 2007. Implementation of the local roads component \nwill  be  concurrent  with  expressway  construction.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is \nattached in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n27.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nthe ADB Guidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding (ICB) will be the basis for \nawarding: (i) ADB-financed civil works contracts in respect of the project expressway estimated \nto cost the equivalent of $5,000,000 or more; (ii) each civil works contract for local roads \ncomponent of the Project to be financed by the Loan estimated to cost the equivalent of \n$2,500,000 or more; and (ii) supply contracts estimated to cost more than $500,000. Local \ncompetitive bidding (LCB) procedures will be used for: (i) each civil works contract for the \nproject expressway estimated to cost the equivalent of less than $5,000,000; (ii) each civil works \ncontract for local roads component of the Project to be financed by the Loan estimated to cost \nthe equivalent of less than $2,500,000; (iii), and civil works contracts to be financed by the \nGovernment. LCB procedures or government procurement procedures may be used for building \nand ancillary facilities financed by the Government. Supply contracts estimated to cost $100,000 \nor less each may be under direct procurement. Civil works for local roads which are scattered in \nvarious  locations  may  be  carried  out  by  SCD  on  a  force  account  basis.  Prequalification, \ntendering,  and  bid  evaluation  for  the  procurement  under  ICB  and  international  shopping \nprocedures  will  be  carried  out  with  the  assistance  of  a  qualified  tendering  company. \nProcurement for ADB financing will include 13 packages of civil works to be implemented under \nICB  procedures,  and  six  packages  of  equipment  under  ICB/international  shopping/direct \nprocurement  procedures.  Prequalified  contractors  with  adequate  technical  and  financial \ncapacities will be allowed to bid for several packages and, if successful, may be awarded more \nthan one contract based on a least-cost combination of contracts. The detailed list of contract \npackages is in Appendix 8. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n28.  It is estimated that a total of about 38 person-months of international consultants will be \nrequired,  of  which  29  person-months  are  for  project  management  and  supervision  of  the \nexpressway; 4 person-months for social and poverty reduction impact monitoring and evaluation \n(2 each for the expressway and local roads component); 2 person-months for road safety; and 1 \nperson-month each for protected area management and environmental compliance monitoring, \nvehicle emissions control, and training engineering staff engaged in the local roads component. \nThe previously stated 29 person-months of international consultants will be used for project \nadministration and implementation supervision. The quality and cost-based selection method \nwill be used to engage an international consulting firm. Overall project supervision will be the \nresponsibility of the CSEO, with which the international consultants will be fully integrated. One \nDCSE will be the team leader of the international consultants and will assist the CSE in project \nand contract management activities, and certify contractor progress payments and contract \nvariations prior to their approval by the CSE. The DCSE will supervise construction during the \nwinter to ensure implementation of the protection measures for wintering gray cranes near the \nYellow River Bridge area. Other international experts will provide short-term assistance to the \nCSEO in the areas of road safety, and project monitoring and evaluation for a PPMS, including \nsocioeconomic performance indicators. International consultants will be financed under the loan, \nand recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Internationally \nrecruited consultants will be required to closely work with domestic consultants. \n \n29.  It is estimated that about 2,300 person-months of domestic consultants will be required \nfor  the  Project.  The  domestic  consulting  firm  will  be  financed  by  SHEC  and  recruited  in \naccordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. About five resident supervision ", "10  \n \nengineer offices (RSEOs) will carry out direct supervision of construction works. Each RSEO will \nsupervise one or two of the major civil work contract packages. SHEC will select about five \nseparate domestic consulting companies to staff the five RSEOs. In addition to construction \nsupervision, domestic consultants will assist SHEC in environmental monitoring, resettlement \nmonitoring, project performance monitoring and evaluation, and SHEC's activities in road safety \nand vehicle emissions control action plan preparation. Outline terms of reference (TOR) for \nconsulting services are in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n30.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with the ADB \nLoan Disbursement Handbook.9 Since most of payments will be made for large contracts well \nabove $100,000, direct payment, reimbursements, and commitment procedures will be used to \nwithdraw the loan funds. If government funds are first used for eligible expenditures, ADB's \nreimbursement procedure will be used. Statements of expenditure will be used for all payments \nunder $100,000 to expedite fund flows. \n \n6.  Advance Procurement Action \n \n31.  The  Government  has  requested,  and  ADB  approved  in  June  2002,  advance \nprocurement action for civil works.10 This covers prequalification of contractors, tendering, and \nbid evaluation for civil works contract packages, but does not include signing of contracts. The \nadvance actions are being undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nand Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government, SCD, and SHEC have been \nadvised that approval of the advance actions does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n32.  SHEC will maintain separate accounts for the Project and related financial statements, \nsuch as statements of source and application of funds, implementation of the Loan Agreement, \nincome  statements,  and  balance  sheet.11  The  income  statements  will  be  started  on \ncommencement of toll operations. SHEC will prepare one set  of financial statements for the \nProject and have them audited annually. The audit will be in accordance with appropriate \nauditing standards consistently applied, by independent external auditors whose qualifications, \nexperience, and TOR are acceptable to ADB. SHEC will submit to ADB within 9 months of the \nend of each related fiscal year, certified copies of audited project accounts and financial \nstatements and an auditor\u2019s report for the Project, all in the English language.  \n \n33.  During the midterm review in 2004 or some other date agreed by SHEC and ADB, \nfinancial projections of SHEC for the next 5 years will be submitted to ADB for its review and \nsuch projections will be updated annually thereafter. Financial performance and projections are \ngiven in Appendix 9. The Government has agreed that, as in previous ADB-financed projects, \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  made  for  reporting  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation. In this regard, SCD/SHEC will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports, in \nsuch  form  and  detail  as  ADB  may  request,  and  brief  monthly  updates.  To  facilitate \npostevaluation of the Project, SHEC will also furnish to ADB, within 3 months of project \ncompletion, a project completion report providing details regarding physical implementation, \nproject costs, recruitment and performance of consultants, procurement of goods and civil \nworks,  performance  of  suppliers  and  contractors,  resettlement  compliance,  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts,  project  financial  and  economic  performance,  and other details as \nrequested by ADB. In addition, SHEC will provide to ADB reports on contract management \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n10 The Project was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in April 2002. \n11  SCD will also maintain separate accounts to the extent related to the Project. ", "  11\n \nprocedures (including approval of variation orders and progress payment certificates), traffic \nforecasts, proposed toll increases, benefit monitoring, and other activities within the required \ntime as stipulated in the Loan and Project Agreements. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n34.  ADB has agreed to a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the performance of \nthe Project in relation to its goals and objectives has been concurred with SCD/SHEC. Prior to \nproject implementation, SHEC will establish the necessary baseline values for impact indicators. \nThese  values  will  be  updated  during  project  implementation.  Specific  indicators  will  be \nmeasured, with the necessary frequency, during project construction. Comments and findings \nregarding project impact will be incorporated in every second ADB quarterly report. Indicators \nfor project evaluation will be measured at project completion and annually for 3 years after \ncompletion.  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  To  facilitate \nassessment of the socioeconomic impact of the Project, TOR for services of an international \nconsultant and local institute/consultants to monitor and evaluate all relevant project impacts \nhave been included in the scope of consulting services to be provided under the Project. \nSocioeconomic effects and poverty reduction impacts of the Project will be demonstrated during \nand after implementation as shown in the PPMS given in Appendix 10 and reported to ADB. \nThe proposed indicators for monitoring economic, poverty, and socioeconomic impacts of the \nProject will be as per the following 10 criteria: (i) major economic indicators, (ii) major poverty \nindicators, (iii) access to infrastructure, (iv) access to health and education, (v) crop production, \n(vi) per capita cash income, (vii) nonfarm economic activities, (viii) living expenses, (ix) housing \nconditions, and (x) major productive assets. Monitoring and evaluation of resettlement will be \nconducted independently by a qualified external organization and SHEC has agreed to provide \nthe external monitor with all grievance redress records for verification. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n35.  ADB and SCD/SHEC will carry out a midterm review of the Project after a year of project \nconstruction commencement or at another time agreed by ADB and SCD/SHEC. It will focus on \nall aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing \nviability. The review will (i) examine the progress in implementing subsector reforms, policy \ndevelopment, progress in resettlement and rehabilitation, and compliance with assurances in \nthe  Loan  Agreement;  and  (ii) consider  complementary  activities  to  enhance  the  poverty \nreduction impact during operation.  \n \n  10.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n36.  During  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  central, \nprovincial, and local government officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and \ncorruption that was added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. ADB\u2019s program for the PRC includes assistance that will improve governance and \nprovide incentives to reduce the incidence of corruption in the longer term. SCD has taken the \nfollowing  initiatives  to  prevent  corruption:  (i) officials from the provincial discipline unit and \nsupervision department will attend activities such as bidding, construction, and operations; \n(ii) establishment of a supervisory committee to prevent interference in the due processes; \n(iii) establishment of a two-contract system, such as the winner of a civil works contract must \nalso sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; (iv) regular meetings between SCD and \nthe  provincial  prosecutor\u2019s  office  to  share  information  and  discuss  corrupt  practices;  and \n(v) midyear and end-of-year inspections of contractors to ensure that procedures related to fund \nwithdrawals and settlements are followed. \n ", "12  \n \n  11.  Capacity Building and Human Resources Development \n \n37.  To cope with its increased expressway construction and management activities, SHEC \nneeds to develop a corporate strategy and outline its managerial, staffing, and investment \nrequirements. A human resources development plan will be drawn up with the help of the \ninternational and domestic consultants. One element of the plan will be an international training \nprogram financed under the loan. It will cover expressway operations, commercial development \nof  expressways  and  business  planning,  expressway  maintenance,  road  safety,  vehicle \nemissions, project management, highway development planning, monitoring and evaluation, \nenvironmental management, bridge and tunnel design, traffic engineering, toll management, \nand pavement design. SHEC staff will undertake about 45 person-months of international \ntraining. With the assistance of the consultants, SHEC will prepare, for ADB\u2019s concurrence, a \nprogram of training activities, their location, and a list of candidates. Findings from the training \nwill be disseminated in Shanxi Province through an appropriate institute. \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Financial Benefits \n \n1.  Traffic Forecast \n \n38.  Average annual growth for road passenger traffic and road freight traffic in Shanxi \nProvince was 8.7% and 8.9%, respectively, in the 1990\u20132000 period. The national growth rates \nwere 9.7% and 5.9%, respectively, over the same period (Appendix 11). There are both \nrailroads and highways in the project area, but no waterway or civil aviation transport services. \nThere are three national highways and 16 provincial highways, as well as a number of county \nand village roads in the project area. National highway G108 is the only existing road linking \nHouma and Yumenkou in the project area and runs parallel to the proposed expressway. In \n1998, the traffic volume on G108 amounted to 11,050 vehicles per day, exceeding the design \ncapacity of 10,000 vehicles per day. The road is overloaded, with a congestion index of 1.39. \nWithout the Project, traffic volumes on G108 would reach about 14,047 vehicles per day in \n2007. A conservative annual 2.7% growth rate was used to estimate the traffic volume from \n1999 to 2007, instead of the 8.7% provincial annual average growth rate  for last 10 years \n(Supplementary Appendix L). \n \n2.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n39.  Through an origins and destinations (O-D) survey,12 future traffic volumes for the next 20 \nyears were projected based on four factors: (i) traffic trends due to economic development and \nthe Yellow River Bridge construction, (ii) diverted traffic from the existing national highway \nG108, (iii) a shift from the railroads, and (iv) induced traffic created by better transportation \nconditions. Projected average traffic volumes between Houma and Yumenkou and crossing the \nYellow River from  2007  to  2026,  were  estimated  by  the  Design  Institute  (Appendix  12). \nConservatively, annual volume growth rates of 6.3% per annum for 2007\u20132015 and 4.1% for \n2016\u20132026 were assumed. \n \n40.  The financial performance of the project expressway was projected taking into account \nthe anticipated traffic, the expected operating costs, and the proposed toll rates.13 Based on \nfinancial projections, the working ratio is expected to be below 12% over the project life. The \n                                                 \n12 Conducted in 1998 at 16 locations in the project area. \n13 The opening toll rates per vehicle-kilometer are: CNY0.3 for cars, CNY0.6 for buses, CNY1.0 for trailer trucks, and \nCNY 1.2 for container trucks. These rates will be reviewed every 5 years and adjusted as necessary. The Yellow \nRiver Bridge opening toll rates are: CNY5.0 for cars, and CNY21.0 for large trucks.  ", "  13\n \ndebt service coverage ratio of more than 1.2 is achievable from the first year of full operation. \nThe debt-to-equity ratio will be below 65:35 over the entire project life. SHEC is expected to be \nfinancially autonomous. Projections based on currently  available information and investment \nplans show that the expressway portfolios will be financially sound. The financial internal rate of \nreturn  (FIRR)  for  the  project  expressway  is  estimated  at  7.6%  (Appendix  13),  which  is \nacceptable as it exceeds the estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 3.7% \n(Supplementary Appendix M). Sensitivity analysis shows that the Project will be able to meet all \nits financial obligations, and that the FIRR will stay above the estimated weighted average cost \nof capital under various adverse scenarios; 6.0%, a 20% increase in the project cost; 5.6%, a \n20% decrease in the toll revenue; 7.5%, a 30% increase in O&M costs; and 7.0%, a one-year \nimplementation delay. A devaluation of the yuan by 30% would reduce the FIRR to 6.4%.  \n \nB.  Economic Benefits  \n \n41.   An economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated based on a comparison of the \nwith-  and  without-project  situations.  The  economic  costs  of  the  project  roads  include  the \nresource costs for construction, operation and maintenance (O&M), resettlement, and the value \nof agricultural production from land lost permanently. Allowance has been made for the costs of \nequipment replacement, road maintenance, and minor improvements to the network without the \nProject. The economic benefits generated by the project roads include (i) vehicle operating cost \n(VOC) and time savings for those who remain on their original routes, (ii) VOC and time savings \nfor those who choose to pay the toll and divert to the new road, (iii) VOC savings on the \nimproved local road network, (iv) benefits from generated traffic, (v) savings from the reduction \nof direct and indirect costs of accidents, (vi) working capital savings to freight in transit, and \n(vii) resource cost savings arising from diversions from rail to road. Environmental benefits will \ncome from avoided vehicular emissions as a result of the reduced level of congestion on \nnational highway G108. However, these benefits were not included in the analysis due to \ndifficulties in quantification. Economic costs and benefits have been valued in 2002 economic \nprices.  Results  are  summarized  in  Appendix  14  and  details  are  given  in  Supplementary \nAppendix N. \n \n42.   The EIRR for the Project is 16.2%, indicating that the Project is economically viable. The \nEIRRs of the expressway and the local roads component are 16.0% and 21.6%, respectively. \nResults  of  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  Project's  economic  viability. \nChanges in the key variables, such as a 20% reduction in VOC savings and growth rate of \nnormal traffic and a 20% increase in costs, do not significantly impact the economic viability. \nThe capital cost would have to increase by about 48% over the base estimate for the EIRR to \nfall below 12%. The benefit level would have to decrease by more than 32% to achieve the \nsame effect. Given previous experience in the PRC, variations of such magnitude are unlikely. \n \nC.  Social and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n \n  1.   Project Beneficiaries \n \n43.  The social and poverty reduction impacts of the Project are summarized in Appendix 15. \nThe social analysis indicates that the largest beneficiary group of the Project will be road \nusers\u2014drivers,  passengers,  freight  and  bus  operators,  local  factories,  and  long-distance \ntraders. Many farmers, particularly those located in the local roads component area, will also \nbenefit from the Project. Those located near the expressway interchanges will also be in a \nposition to increase agricultural and other incomes through improved access to markets, more \ncompetitive prices for their products, and cheaper transport costs. Local people served by the \nProject will experience improved access to education, health facilities, other social services \nsuch as increased cultural activities, and interaction with the rest of the world. SCD/SHEC will \nengage an international monitoring specialist through a firm as well as domestic consultants to ", "14  \n \nmonitor project effects and to assess changes in socioeconomic conditions in poor areas. \nSocioeconomic data will be collected and analyzed according to the indicators suggested in the \nPPMS. \n \n2.  Impact on Women and Minorities \n \n44.  Women participate fully in the rural economy and frequently engage in rural enterprises \nand small trade. Although women are underrepresented as drivers, long-distance traders, and in \nthe management of enterprises, the impacts on farmers and enterprise workers apply equally to \nwomen. The local roads component will assist women in expanding production of vegetables, \nfruits, animal husbandry, and small-scale retail activities, as well as in improving agriculture in \ngeneral. Although women\u2019s role in construction works is estimated to account for only 15% of \nthe overall labor employment, women will be given equal opportunities and pay for construction \nand operational jobs in accordance with the ADB  Policy on Gender and Development and \nADB\u2019s  Gender  Action  Plan  2000\u20132003.  The  Project  will  also  include  specific  action  for \n(i) construction camp and itinerant worker health issues, (ii) women\u2019s representation in public \nconsultations,  and  (iii) project  performance  monitoring  systems  using  gender-differentiated \nsocioeconomic data. The only minority population living in the project area consists of Hui \nnationals (less than 0.2% of the total population). They ilve mostly in the urban areas of \nYuncheng  Prefecture.  No  adverse  impacts  from  the  construction  of  the  expressway  are \nforeseen. Instead, they will benefit equally from the new expressway. \n \n3.  Poverty Reduction Impacts \n \n45.  The impact of transport infrastructure investments on poverty reduction is demonstrated \nby recent studies using an econometric model that examined the effectiveness of government \nexpenditure in various sectors in contributing to growth and poverty reduction in the PRC and \nIndonesia.14 The studies concluded that, compared to other sectors, such as irrigation, soil and \nwater, power, education, and health, government expenditure on roads has the largest impact \non  poverty  reduction,  productivity,  and  growth.  Infrastructure  is  a  precondition  for  poverty \nreduction. The research report on the PRC also suggests that, similar to education, the large \nimpact of rural infrastructure on poverty comes mainly from improved employment opportunities \n(in addition to the impact on agricultural growth). Labor is the major resource of the poor. To be \nable to capitalize on their major asset, the poor need to have access to jobs and to be able to \ntransport the goods that they produce to markets. Roads for poor rural areas lower transport \ncosts, reduce the cost of inputs, improve access to services and jobs, and therefore improve \nfarming practices; they also provide better access to health and education.  \n  \n46.  Of  Shanxi  province\u2019s  85  counties,  35  are  classified  as  poverty  counties.  Poverty \nincidence in rural Shanxi was reported at 7.5% and a draft ADB report (2001) quotes urban \npoverty in Shanxi at 7.2% using income distribution data. Poverty reduction considerations have \nbeen an integral part of project design. The Project includes measures to extend socioeconomic \nbenefits to the poor, in particular the local road program. The data show that approximately \n48,40015 poor people will directly benefit from the Project, accounting for 4.8% of the total \npopulation (1 million) in the project area. The poverty incidence in the project area is relatively \nlow. In the PRC, about 12% of the population live below CNY1,000 annual per capita income. \nHowever, a high percentage of people have an average income just above the poverty line and \nare vulnerable. Based on an income distribution analysis, it was observed that about additional \n                                                 \n14 S. Fan, L. Zhang, and X. Zhang. 2000.

Washington, DC. \n15 i.e., those with CNY1,000 of rural and CNY3,000 of urban per capita annual incomes.  ", "  15\n \n6% (59,225) of the total population of the project area are earning annual incomes of between \nCNY1,001 to CNY1,300 in rural areas and CNY3,001 to CNY3,300 in urban areas. The poverty \nimpact assessment shows that villages that now have poor road access in the project area will \nhave  higher  incomes  resulting  from  improved  road  accessibility  because  of  increased \nagricultural production and other economic activities. \n \n47.  To enhance the poverty reduction impact of the Project, SPG agreed that (i) all roads \nfinanced under the Project, i.e., the expressway and the local roads, would utilize wage labor, \nwages being set at market rates that currently correspond to approximately CNY20 per day for \nunskilled labor; and (ii) construction companies involved in civil works for the expressway and \nbridges component, and the local roads component will commit to hiring the highest possible \nshare of the labor force from poor villages. The construction of the expressway/the bridge and \nthe upgrading of the local road will require about 4,680 person-years and 520 person-years of \nunskilled laborers, respectively. If 50% of unskilled jobs are given to the poor beneficiaries in the \nproject area who are below the provincial poverty line, total additional incomes of poor laborers \nto  be  generated  through  the  Project  are  estimated  at  about  CNY17 million  for  the \nexpressway/bridge construction and CNY2 million for the local roads component. In addition, \nduring the operational phase, up to 100 poor workers will be employed for simple maintenance \nworks; their living conditions will improve. The wages from employment during construction and \noperation of the Project will increase family incomes, raise living standards, and  thus reduce \npoverty. The impact of the Project on poverty reduction will be evaluated during and after project \nimplementation.  \n \n4.  Resettlement Impacts  \n \n48.  The resettlement plan was prepared in December 2001 based on the feasibility study \nand ADB approved it in May 2002. The resettlement plan includes the outcomes of the impact \nsurvey and the socioeconomic survey that were jointly conducted by the Second Highway \nDesign and Research Institute under MOC, SCD, and the Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences \nas well as city and county government officials. The socioeconomic survey sampled seven \nvillages and 175 households in the three counties in the project area. These represent 14% of \naffected villages and 18% of affected households. Findings from the impact survey estimate that \nthe Project will acquire about 411 hectares (ha) of land and temporarily affect 127 ha. A total of \n850 households (3,568 people) will lose land permanently; this impact will be mitigated by \nredistribution of land in the affected villages and income rehabilitation measures. About 54 \nhouseholds will have their houses affected; of them, 20 households will need to be relocated. \nAbout  4,000  square  meters  of  structures,  including  houses,  will  be  demolished  and  one \nenterprise  in  Xinjiang  County  will  lose  its  structure.  Measures  have  been  proposed  to \nrehabilitate the economy and the living standards of affected persons. For route selection, \ncriteria  to  minimize  resettlement  impacts  were  established,  including  avoidance  of  highly \npopulated areas, irrigation facilities, townships with low per capita farmland, and historic sites. \nCompensation rates for affected houses, farmland, and other assets were based on the Shanxi \nRegulations for Land Administration (2001). The resettlement budget was established at about \n$31.2 million equivalent. SCD/SHEC agreed that it would fund the resettlement costs according \nto the standards set out in the resettlement plan. \n \n49.  Internal monitoring will be conducted by SHEC and resettlement offices of Yuncheng \ncity, county, and township governments. SHEC will be responsible for submitting quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB. A regular monitoring and reporting system will be established to \nensure that key resettlement activities are implemented on time and adequately. SHEC will \nengage an external agency acceptable to ADB for monitoring resettlement plan activities. The \nexternal  monitor  will  conduct  baseline  surveys,  investigate  resettlement  implementation \nprogress and prepare monitoring and evaluation reports for submission to SHEC and ADB. \nThese reports will be submitted every 6 months during resettlement plan implementation. After ", "16  \n \nthe completion of resettlement, two annual investigations will be carried out by the external \nmonitor to assess whether rehabilitation measures have fully restored incomes and livelihoods \nof all affected people. The reports of these annual investigations will be prepared by the external \nmonitor and submitted to SHEC and ADB. \n \n5.  Participatory Activities \n \n50.  During  the  preparation  of  the  Project,  SHEC  undertook  several  opinion  surveys, \nsocioeconomic surveys, and public meetings which raised the level of awareness, gained local \nsupport, and enabled stakeholders to voice opinions and suggestions for project design and \nimplementation. A chronology of public consultations held are summarized in Appendix 4 with \ndetails found in Supplementary Appendix B. These participatory activities form the basis of a \nsocial  development  action  plan  (Appendix  15)  which  shows  measures  SHEC  agrees  to \nundertake to ensure negative impacts are avoided or mitigated, and the Project benefits are \nenhanced, especially for target groups. The participatory approach was initiated during project \ndesign  and  is  an  ongoing  activity  which  will  be  continued  during  project implementation. \nVulnerable  segments  of  the  population  have  been  carefully  considered  in  conducting \nparticipatory activities. For example, for the selection of unskilled labor in the project area, \nSHEC will identify appropriate team leaders in poor villages in the project area and provide \ntraining. The team leaders will then select a labor team from poor households in their village. \nThe village committees and  SHEC will coordinate the signing of the contracts between the \ncontractors and the team leaders from poor villages. Gender issues were also given due \nattention. Despite the equal opportunities law of PRC, the women are under-represented as \ndrivers, vehicle operators, long-distance traders, the public sector and the management of \nenterprises.  SHEC  has  set targets whereby  50%  of  the  service  related  and  20-25% of \nmanagement related employment of the Project to be given to women. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n \n  1.  Natural Resources and Project Impacts \n \n51.  The Project is classified as environmental category A by ADB. The environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) was prepared by the Research Institute of Highways, MOC in August 2001. \nThe EIA was approved by the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) on 8 \nMarch 2002. A summary EIA was circulated  to the ADB Board on 29 May 2002. The EIA \nassesses the environmental impacts of the selected alignment and prescribes environmental \nprotection and mitigation measures, with an estimated cost of about CNY21.7 million equivalent. \nA comprehensive soil erosion control plan was approved by the Ministry of Water Resources on \n8 February 2002. The proposed Yellow River Bridge is located 2.5 km upstream of the northern \nborder and 4 km from the core zone border of the provincial reserve for wintering gray cranes. \nTo protect the cranes from any possible adverse impacts, an action plan was prepared by the \nResearch  Institute  of  Highways.  The  action  plan  includes  necessary  engineering  control \nmeasures, monitoring, training, measures for environmental enforcement, and an enrichment \nprogram  to  reduce  disturbance  of  crane  feeding  areas.  The  action  plan  also  includes \nestablishment  of  an  environmental  management  unit  in  SHEC,  jointly  with  staff  from  the \nYuncheng Environmental Protection Bureau (YEPB) and environment consultants.  \n \n2.  Vehicle Emissions \n \n52.  Air quality in most PRC cities, and in many rural areas, is poor. The major cause is the \nburning of coal in power plants, boilers, district heating systems, factories, and burning of \nagricultural  wastes.  However,  pollution  from  vehicles  is  increasing  rapidly  and  has  drawn \nattention to particular pollutants. More details on road safety and vehicle emissions are given in \nAppendix 16. In some cities, vehicles already account for 80% of total carbon monoxide ", "  17\n \nemission levels, 50% of nitrogen oxides, and a substantial proportion of lead. The Government \nhas recognized this problem and the amendments to the Air Pollution Law in 2000 added a \nchapter on motor vehicle pollution. An ADB TA for market-based instruments included a case \nstudy in Beijing that explored use of vehicle taxes, fuel taxes, emission charges, congestion \ncharges, and tradable area licenses, to help reduce vehicle emissions. Under a regional TA \nADB is assisting DMC governments including PRC16 in developing and implementing policies to \nreduce vehicle emissions on a regional basis. These activities including improving fuel quality, \nfinding alternative fuels, regulations on two- and three-wheeled motorized vehicles, vehicle \ntesting, inspection, and transport planning.  More details about these programs are given in \nSupplementary Appendix O. \n \n53.  Assistance will be provided by SCD and SHEC to YEPB to cooperatively develop a \nprovincial vehicle emissions control plan according to the national action plan on strengthening \nvehicle inspection and maintenance, prior to expressway operations. The work related to road \nsafety and vehicle emissions control has been a policy dialogue issue under several previous \nTAs. In 1999, advisory TAs were provided for the improvement of air quality in Shanxi and the \nimprovement of traffic safety in the PRC.17 While ADB will continue its dialogue with the \nGovernment to facilitate the implementation of the national action plans to be proposed under \nthe TAs, ADB and SPG agreed to (i) develop a coordination framework between SHEC and all \nother related agencies in Shanxi (i.e., Shanxi Public Security Department, YEPB, and SCD) to \npromote successful road safety and vehicle emissions control strategies, and (ii) implement a \nvehicle emission control action plan with targets. Under the Project, international specialists \nadequately supported by domestic consultants will also be engaged in this area to assist SHEC \nand other agencies. \n \nE.  Project Risks \n \n54.   The Project has been formulated to reduce potential technical and economic risks. The \nmain technical risks, which could result in implementation delays and changes in the cost \nestimates, are associated with the construction of the Yellow River Bridge and 11 large bridges. \nTo mitigate these risks, consultants have reviewed the proposed construction methods. The \nprequalification of contractors will focus on their financial and technical capability in handling \nsimilar works. During the construction period, monitoring and contract management information \nsystems will be set up and implemented with the assistance of the international consultants for \ntimely identification of technical problems and implementation of corrective measures. There are \nno  major  resettlement  risks;  adequate  mitigation  plans,  and  implementation  capacity  and \nmonitoring mechanisms will be put in place for resettlement. \n \n55.   Economic performance of the project implementation agency would have to deteriorate \nsubstantially for the Project to cease being economically viable. Sensitivity analysis indicates \nthat the economic benefits of the Project are stable. While a financial risk is associated with \nconstruction and operation of the expressway, its extent will depend on the actual construction \ncosts. To mitigate this financial risk, SHEC is consciously oriented to building up a commercial \nbusiness environment for expressway operations, and the project expressway will also receive \nsubstantial equity injections from the central and provincial governments. As the Project will \ngenerate revenue in domestic currency, there is a risk related to exchange rate variations. \nHowever, sensitivity tests indicate that an adverse exchange rate change will have only a limited \neffect on the FIRR. \n \n56. The main environmental risks are associated with possible (i) adverse impacts on the \nYuncheng Wetland Nature Reserve and (ii) soil erosion. Any possible adverse impacts on the \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2000. Regional TA on Action Plans for Reducing Vehicle Emissions. Manila \n17 ADB. 1999.

Road construction will intensify the effects \nof soil erosion due to vegetation removal, soil disturbance, and exposure of bare soil surface. \nAn action plan including protective measures for gray crane habitats and a comprehensive soil \nerosion control plan were developed under the guidance of the Shanxi Forestry Department and \nShanxi Nature Reserve Administrative Station. The related expenses are included in the project \ncost. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n57.

Traffic Demand \n \n1.  Implementation of the economic reform policies since 1978 has resulted in rapid growth \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) economy, and a corresponding increase in the demand \nfor transport services.1 Despite the Government's efforts to increase the country's transport \ncapacity, serious constraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road subsector. By the \nend of 2000, the PRC transport system comprised about 68,000 kilometers (km) of railways, \n1.4 million km of highways, 119,300 km of inland waterways, and 1.5 million km of civil aviation \nroutes. However, the density of the PRC transport network ranks among the lowest in the region \nrelative to population or land area.2  \n \n2.  The privately owned fleet of motor vehicles in the PRC increased more than 20 times \nduring 1985\u20132000, from 0.3 million vehicles to 6.3 million. In 2000, the PRC vehicle fleet totaled \n15.5 million trucks, cars, and buses, and 46.5 million other motorized vehicles (special vehicles, \ntractors, and motorcycles). The total number of trucks, cars, and buses increased by about \n1.3 million in 2000, with the share for trucks dropping to 45.0%, down from 66.8% in 1990. \nDespite the rapid increase in total vehicles, the PRC has only about 1.3 vehicles (trucks, cars or \nbuses) for 100 persons, which is low relative to other countries in the Asia and Pacific region. \nUntil the early 1980s, there were no modern vehicles imported or joint ventures formed to \nintroduce  modern  technology.  There  are  plans  to  invest  up  to  $7  billion  in  automotive \nmanufacturing in the PRC between 2000 and 2005. The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade \nOrganization should increase investment in automobile production. The modernization of the \nvehicle fleet will improve vehicle safety and reduce fuel consumption and vehicle emissions.  \n \n3.  Road freight traffic in Shanxi Province increased from 11.5 billion ton-km to 27.0 billion \nton-km between 1990 and 2000. Road passenger traffic increased during the same period from \n5.9 billion passenger-km to 13.6 billion passenger-km, corresponding to an average annual \ngrowth rate of 8.9% and 8.7%, respectively, compared with the national growth rates of 5.9% \nand 9.7%. In Shanxi, privately owned motor vehicles in 2000 totaled about 235,078. Given the \nPRC's rapid economic growth and vehicle ownership, both the public and private vehicle fleets \nare expected to continue to grow rapidly in the coming years. This will result in substantial \nincreases in the volume of road traffic and mounting congestion. The high share of slow-moving \ntraffic,  mainly  tractors,  bicycles,  and  nonmotorized  agricultural  vehicles,  aggravates  road \ncongestion, and is a major cause of traffic accidents. In 2000, Shanxi had about 555,000 trucks \nand passenger vehicles, equal to 3.6% of the national fleet. This translates into 1.71 vehicles \nper 100 persons in Shanxi, slightly above the national average.  \n \nB.  Road Transport Institutions and Administration.  \n \n4.  Several  institutions  are  involved  in  the  road  transport  industry.  The  provincial \ncommunications  departments  (PCDs)  are  responsible  for  regulating  the  industry  through \nlicensing drivers, vehicles, and intercity bus services. Through tariff reform in trucking, there has \nbeen an increase in private operations resulting in improved transport efficiency and quality of \n                                                 \n1  Between 1990 and 2000, domestic passenger transport in all modes grew by 8.0% per annum in passenger-km. \nFreight transport in all modes grew at 5.2% per year in ton-km. Road traffic grew at 9.7% per annum for passenger \ntraffic and 5.9% per annum for freight. In 2000, road traffic accounted for 54.2% of total passenger-km, followed by \nrailways with 36.8%, civil aviation with 8.2%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.8%. \n2  In terms of density per square kilometer (km2) of land area, the PRC's transport network in 2000 is one sixth of \nIndia's network and one fifth of that of the Republic of Korea.

This process has been supported through an Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA).3 Road administration is decentralized. ADB \nhas supported human resources development in sector institutions under loans and TAs. \n \nC.  Road Subsector Revenues and Expenditures \n \n5.  Dedicated user charges, government grants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and \nforeign loans and investments are used to finance expenditures in highway infrastructure in the \nPRC. Dedicated user charges, the road maintenance fee and the vehicle maintenance fee, have \nprovided much of the financing for the road sector. In Shanxi, road maintenance fees and \ndomestic borrowings are major financing sources for its budget. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan \n(9FYP, 1996\u20132000), the road maintenance fee, levied on the revenue of freight and passenger \ntransport companies and on the load capacity of private vehicles, provided about 26% of the \ntotal financing requirements of road investments, and the domestic borrowings provided about \n30%. The provincial road budgets during 9FYP increased from CNY5,615 million in 1996 to \nCNY6,276 million in 2000. However, an increasing proportion of provincial road budgets is being \nused to meet the national priority for expressway and highway construction. In addition, the \nproportion of funding for road maintenance has decreased from 10% in 1996 to 8% in 2000. The \nProject, however, includes not only the construction of new expressway but also the upgrading \nof local roads, so that it will help ensure balanced expenditures among different types of roads. \nRevenues and expenditures in the road subsector in Shanxi Province are in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n  \nD.  Lessons Learned  \n \n6.  In 1998,  ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department (OED) completed its first country \nassistance program evaluation. The evaluation concluded that ADB\u2019s monitoring mechanisms \nshowed high levels of performance for ongoing transport projects and TAs. Also in 1998, OED \ncarried out a special study on the operation and maintenance of road facilities and their impact \non project sustainability.4 The study concluded that maintenance of roads completed under \nADB-financed projects has not been a serious problem in the PRC. An effective budgetary \nallocation system is in place, and strong institutional capacity to maintain the expressway \nsystem has been developed. \n \n7.  ADB's TA program in the road subsector has been generally successful. Some of the \nmore recent TAs have been instrumental in focusing the Government's attention on the need to \nexpand its sources of finance for highway development; and on the institutional, policy, and \nregulatory issues that need to be addressed to facilitate the use of a broader set of modalities \nfor domestic and foreign resource mobilization. Specific improvements have been effected as a \nresult,  and  are  now  being  disseminated  widely  to  all  provinces.  In  January  2001,  OED \ncompleted a performance audit report on traffic safety TAs. The two road safety TAs involving \nthe PRC were rated as highly satisfactory. \n \n8.   An ADB-financed study for the five administrative areas in the southwest region showed \nthat lack of high-class roads limited the provision of transport services in and out of the region, \nbetween and within the administrative areas, and increased the cost of transport.

This shift in focus of ADB operations is in \nline with ADB\u2019s strategic objective of reducing poverty in inland provinces. The Government \nrecently reaffirmed its policy of increasing road subsector funding to implement the  national \ntrunk highway system as a principal means of promoting and sustaining economic growth. It \nintends  to  continue  seeking  the  assistance  of  multilateral  development  banks  for  the \nconstruction of the national trunk highway system and the western region corridors, especially \nthe sections generating revenue that can be used for debt servicing. \n \nE.  Road Subsector Policy Reform Plan \n \n9.  ADB has been actively involved in policy dialogue on the PRC road subsector since \n1991. The principal issues addressed include the poverty reduction impact of road projects, \nhighway design standards and construction quality, road safety, vehicle emissions, pricing \npolicies, commercialization and corporatization, and nongovernment financial resources. The \nstatus and achievements to date were discussed and summarized in the Road Subsector Policy \nReform Plan (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \nTable A5: Road Subsector Policy Reform Plan  \n \n  Initiative    Current Status    Actions    Target Date \n 1.

The project expressway and local roads will affect 11 townships and 52 administrative \nvillages in three counties: Xinjiang, Jishan, and Hejin. The Project is estimated to permanently \noccupy about 411 hectares as confirmed by the impact survey. The permanent land acquisition \nis equivalent to the loss of farmland of 3,568 people (850 households). Most of the households \nwill regain similar farmland through land redistribution. About 5,200 sqm of structures, including \n54 houses, will be affected, necessitating relocation of 20 households. One enterprise will also \nlose its structure. \n \n2.  Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were minimized through the following actions: \n(i) aligning the expressway away from areas with high population densities and by avoiding \nhistoric relics; (ii) occupying wasteland, waste hills for alignment, where possible; (iii) avoiding \nvillages  with  lower  per  capita  farmland;  (iv) reducing  the  amount  of  land  acquisition  for \ninterchanges to the extent possible; and (v) protecting water conservancy and irrigation facilities \nas far as possible. Consultations were held with local officials to minimize resettlement effects \nduring the setting of the alignment during the feasibility study and detailed study. \n \n3.  The Second Highway Design and Research Institute (SHDRI) under the Ministry of \nCommunications  conducted  initial  socioeconomic  surveys  and  interviews  with  local \ngovernments and villagers in the project area from February 1998 to June 1999. In November\u2013\nDecember 2001, a resettlement expert group composed of staff from a local community and the \nSHDRI, as well as city and county government officials, conducted detailed land acquisition, \ncensus and socioeconomic surveys in the project influence area in conjunction with the Shanxi \nCommunications Department (SCD). \n \n4.  For people unavoidably affected by the Project, the resettlement objective is to ensure \nattainment of equal or better livelihoods and living standards in line with the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) Land Administration Law (1998) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy \non  involuntary  resettlement  (1995).  The  law  is  supplemented  by  the  Methods  for  Land \nManagement and Execution in Shanxi Province (2000). The Executing Agency will ensure that \nany people losing land, housing or other assets and means of production will be assisted in \nrestoring  their  incomes  and  living  standards  to  at  least  the  levels  without  the  Project\u2019s \nintervention. Assets will either be replaced or their owners compensated at replacement cost. \nThe total resettlement budget is about $31.2 million equivalent (CNY258.2 million). \n \n5.  Land compensation payments are calculated at eight times the annual average output \nvalue (AAOV) of the land over the past 3 years. A resettlement subsidy is calculated at five \ntimes AAOV over the past 3 years. Payment is made to the village commission. Young crops \nthat cannot be harvested before land acquisition are compensated at average purchasing price \nper season of the crop compensation rate. Temporarily acquired land is paid the AAOV for each \nyear of occupation. Topsoil is stored and then replaced in the original site at the end of \noccupation. The cost of restoring land to farmland will be paid by the Project; some payments \ncan be made directly to the farmers for helping to restore these lands. \n \n6.  People losing houses will receive direct compensation according to the class and type of \nhouse. Compensation is based on the floor area and material, and there will be no depreciation \nof housing values, and the affected people will be allowed to salvage materials from their former \nhouses without deduction from their  compensation. They can choose to construct their own \nhouse, or to request that the township or village arrange this for them. The new house is to be \nconstructed and the family relocated before the former dwelling is demolished. ", "34 Appendix 6 \n7.  For private enterprises, work stoppage compensation will be paid monthly based on the \nmonthly  average  net  profit  of  the  previous  6  months  of  commercial  operations.  All  costs \nassociated with relocation of the enterprise, transfer costs, and compensation for affected \nassets will be paid by the Project. Workers in these enterprises will be paid their full monthly \nsalaries for the period during which commercial operations are disrupted. Full compensation will \nbe paid for construction of a new commercial site, with no deductions for depreciation of the \nformer site.  \n \n8.  Along the proposed expressway alignment, only eight of the 38 affected villages have \nserious land losses\u2014more than 10% of their cultivated land. Households losing agricultural land \nwill receive agricultural rehabilitation within the affected villages, either by land adjustment to \nensure that village members still have sufficient land to farm, or by providing compensation \nfunds.  The  village  rehabilitation  plans  may  include  crop  diversification,  animal  husbandry, \nimproved irrigation facilities, sideline enterprises, and livelihood training. \n \n9.  The Coordination Office of the Shanxi Hou-yu Expressway Construction Company Ltd. \n(SHEC) and the coordination offices at the county level will supervise the resettlement program. \nThe  county  resettlement  offices  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  resettlement  and \ndelegating activities to township officials and village committees affected by the Project. The \ntownship offices will sign land acquisition and resettlement agreements with affected villages \nand individuals, pay compensation, and carry out the daily specific implementation of land \nacquisition and resettlement.  \n \n10.  Information  about  the  resettlement  program  has  been  disseminated  through  public \nmedia such as newspapers, radio, public notices, and meetings at township and village levels to \npromote understanding and support from all communities in the project area. The resettlement \ninformation booklet has been distributed to people in all affected villages.  In addition to the \ninformation campaign, affected households will participate in land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities. In addition, there is a system for registering complaints by any persons affected by the \nProject. \n \n11.  The resettlement plan will have both internal and external monitoring. Methods for both \nare specified in the resettlement plan. A five-person resettlement unit in SHEC, in collaboration \nwith the county resettlement office, will do internal supervision and monitoring. SHEC will \nensure compliance with the regulations set out in the resettlement plan. SCD/SHEC has agreed \nto a set of supervision milestones with ADB, which are already in effect to ensure timely \nimplementation  of  resettlement  activities  (see  Table  A6).  SHEC  will  engage  an  external \nmonitoring agency acceptable to ADB. The external monitor will conduct baseline surveys, \ninvestigate  resettlement  implementation  progress  and  prepare  monitoring  and  evaluation \nreports for submission to SHEC and ADB every  6 months during the implementation of the \nresettlement plan. After the completion of resettlement, annual investigations will be carried for \n2 years to assess whether rehabilitation measures have fully restored incomes and livelihoods \nof all affected people. Annual evaluation reports will be prepared by the external monitor and \nsubmitted to SHEC and ADB. \n ", "Appendix 6  35\nTable A6:  Resettlement Supervision Milestones \n(as of November 14, 2002) \n \n      Responsible     \nNo.  Resettlement Tasks  Target  Agency  Deadline  Status \n1.

General \n \n1.  The projected financial performance is based on the following assumptions and the \nproforma financial statements are for 24 years from 2003 to 2026. All projections are in current \nterms. The domestic inflation rates are 2.0% for 2003, 3.0% for 2004, and 4% for 2005 onward. \nThe international inflation rate used is 2.4% throughout the projection period. \n \nB.  Financial Performance \n \n2.   The project expressway financial projections are based upon the following assumptions: \n \n(i)   Corporate income tax1 is assessed against the expressway operating entity at \n \n33% of net profit per year. \n \n(ii)   Government contriubtions consist of equity capital contributed by Ministry of \nCommunications (MOC) and Shanxi Communications Department (SCD). \n \n(iii)   Contributions from MOC and SCD will be CNY470 million and CNY808 million, \nrespectively, and will be invested during the first 4 years of construction to cover \ninitial project costs. \n \n(iv)  The toll rates expected to be levied to the project expressway are in 2002 prices \nand based upon the traffic forecast estimated by SCD for various types of \nvehicles (Table A9.1).  Proposed future tolls are based on a nominal annual \nincrease of 10% until 2010, 5% until 2015 and no increase after 2015. Future \ntolls will be adjusted in 2010 and 2015 for the expressway and in 2015 for the \nbridge. Traffic volumes were forecast to increase by 6.3% per year during 2007\u2013\n2015 and 4.1% per year during 2016\u20132026. \n \nTable A9.1: Projected Toll Rates for Expressway and Bridge \n(CNY per vehicle km) \n \n  Expressway  Yellow River Bridge \nVehicle Type  2007\u20132009  2010\u20132014  2015\u20132026  2007\u20132014  2015\u20132026 \nCar and Van  0.30  0.40  0.50    5.00    7.00 \nBus  0.60  0.75  0.90    10.00    14.00 \nSmall Truck  0.30  0.40  0.50    5.00    7.00 \nMedium Truck  0.60  0.75  0.90    10.00    14.00 \nLarge Truck  0.90  1.05  1.20    15.00    21.00 \nTrailer Truck  1.00  1.20  1.40    15.00    21.00 \nContainer Truck   1.20  1.40  1.60    15.00    21.00 \nWeighted Average  0.56  0.70  0.84    9.16     12.82 \n  Source: Price Control Bureau of the Shanxi Planning Committee. \n \nThe toll analysis was based on detailed traffic forecast and projected toll rates. \nAs shown in Table A9.1, the projected expressway toll rate is at CNY0.3 ($0.035) \n \n1  Business tax was abolished, effective 1 January 2001. ", "40 Appendix 9 \nper passenger car kilometer and CNY5.0 ($0.6) for the Yellow River Bridge. \nThese rates will increase up to CNY0.5 ($0.06) and CNY7.0 ($0.85) in 2015 for \nthe road and the Bridge, respectively. The expressway toll rates are within the \nrange of toll rate prevailing in the region ($0.03-0.08) per car kilometer. The \nproposed toll rates are such that toll revenues cover O&M costs, debt servicing \nand depreciation in excess of debt servicing. The proposed toll rate is similar to \nthat used in similar ADB-financed projects. \n \n(v)   The  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  including  routine  maintenance,  are \nCNY10.5 million per year. The operation costs are based upon the employment \nof 350 personnel to operate four interchange tolling station, bridge toll station, \nand a service area. Each of these facilities requires 50 persons. Average wages \nand welfare costs are estimated at CNY20,000 per year in mid-2002 prices. The \nmaintenance costs have been estimated on the basis of a unit rate of CNY54,000 \nper year per kilometer at 2002 prices. In addition, the expressway is scheduled to \nbe paved after 15 years of operation at a cost of CNY2.2 million per km in current \nprices. Operation costs will increase in line with traffic growth and domestic \ninflation. Maintenance costs will increase in line with domestic inflation. \n    \n(vi)   The loan repayments will begin in 2007. The interest rate charged on the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) loan was estimated at 5.6% (based on the six-month \nLIBOR rate in US dollars in June 2002 and the five-year swap cost for variable to \nfixed interest rate) and the interest rate on the domestic loan is 6.21%. The \ncommitment fee of 0.75% per year and the 1.0% front-end fee for the ADB loan \nare also included. \n \nC.  Summary of Financial Statements \n \n3.   The tentative financial projections (Table A9.2) indicate that the expected revenues at \nthe rates proposed are sufficient to cover the operation costs and debt repayments on the ADB \nand domestic loans. The debt-to-equity ratio of much less than 65:35 from the first year of the \nexpressway construction and the decreasing debt-to-equity ratios thereafter indicate a sound \nfinancial condition for the expressway under the proposed financing plan. The return on equity \nwill be positive from the beginning of operations. This ratio indicates that the Shanxi Hou-yu \nExpressway Construction Company Limited, which was created to operate the expressway, can \nsustain totally commercial operations from the start of the operating year 2007, if SCD decides \nto diversify the ownership of expressway operations in the future. \n \n \n ", "Table A9.2: Projected Financial Statements for SHEC\n(CNY million)\n

Additional traffic surveys were carried out and the data were updated in August 2000. The \nfeasibility study team once again updated the data in January 2002. The traffic forecast, including \ntraffic counts and an origin-destination (O-D) survey cover the project influence area\u2014Hejin \nCounty, Jishan County, Xinjiang County, and the surrounding 12 counties and cities. \n \nB.  Existing Traffic Conditions \n \n1.  Railway Network \n \n2.  There are both railway and highway transportation in the project area, but no waterway \nand civil aviation transport services are available. Two railroads are currently operating: the South \nTong-Pu Railroad and the Hou-Xi Railroad. The South Tong-Pu Railroad, running southward from \nYuci to Fengningdu, passes by Houma, while the Hou-Xi railroad, running from Houma to Xian in \nShaanxi province, is parallel all its length to the proposed expressway. In 1996, the passengers \non South Tong-Pu railroad amounted to 7.39 million people, and freight 35.09 million tons. For \nHou-Xi Railroad, the numbers were 2.19 million people and 8.15 million tons, respectively. \n \n2.  Roadway Network \n \n3.  There are three national highways and 16 provincial highways, as well as a number of \ncounty and village roads in the project area. In 1998, the area had a total road mileage of \n15,960 kilometers (km), with a road density of 44.2 km of road per 100 square (sq) km, and a \nvehicle ownership of 83,000 vehicles. From 1985 through 1998, the annual growth rate for \npassenger and freight traffic in this area were, on average, 9.95% and 11.03%, respectively. The \nmajor roads related to the project influence area include national highway G108 (Huozhou City to \nHancheng),  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  national  highway  G209  (Shixian  to  Pinglu),  provincial \nhighways S235 (Houma to Fenglingdu), S236 (Houma to Anyi), and S331 (Quwo to Huixian). The \nnational highway G108 is the only existing road linking Houma and Yumenkou in the project \ninfluence area and runs parallel to the proposed expressway. Six of the traffic count stations on \nG108 were located between Houma and Yumenkou (Table A12.1).  \n \nTable A12.1: Traffic Volume of G108 between Houma and Yumenkou (1998) \n(vehicles/day) \n \n            Annual \nTraffic Count Station  Houma 1 Houma 2 Xinjiang Jishan 1 Jishan 2  Hejin  Average\nMotor Vehiclesa  17,524  13,788  9,572  7,586  7,298  10,530  11,050 \nCongestion Index  2.11  1.70  1.29  0.91  0.86  1.43  1.39 \na  Weighted average of traffic volume without tractors and motorcycles. \n \n4.  As shown by the 1998 data of these stations, the annual average traffic volume on G108 \nbetween Houma and Yumenkou amounted to a mixed traffic volume of 11,050 vehicles per day, \nexceeding the design capacity of 10,000 vehicles per day. The road was overloaded, with a \ncongestion index of 1.39. \n ", "    Appendix 12   47\n5.  There are 28,307 vehicles actually recorded during the  O-D survey, including  16,336 \nfreight vehicles (57.7%) and 11,971 passenger vehicles (42.3%), as shown in Table A12.2. The \nmedium trucks and trailer trucks had the biggest share in freight movement, while passenger cars \naccounted for higher percentage than buses. \n \nTable A12.2: Vehicle Types in Project Area \n \nVehicle Type  Number  % \n  Bus    4,729  16.7 \n  Passenger Car    7,242  25.6 \n  Light Truck    3,561  12.6 \n  Heavy Truck    2,185  7.7 \n  Medium Truck    6,712  23.7 \n  Trailer Truck    3,667  12.95 \n  Container Truck    211  0.75 \n  All Motor Vehicles    28,307  100.00 \n \n6.  The results of the O-D survey show that: \n \n(i)  The purpose of the passenger movement was mostly business trips, tourist trips \naccounted for only 18% of the total. \n \n(ii)  In freight movement, coal freight accounted for the biggest share (60.7%), while \nsteel and nonferrous metal products ranked second (6.4%). Freight transport is \nmostly long-haul and medium-haul. Hazardous materials like petroleum products \n(2.0%), fertilizers and pesticides (1.6%) were relatively insignificant. For more \ndetails on the O-D survey, please refer to Supplementary Appendix L.  \n \nC.  Traffic Forecast \n \n7.  Future traffic demands for the next 20 years, as shown in Table A12.3, were projected \nbased on four components: traffic trend, diverted traffic, shift from railroad, and induced traffic. \nVolume growth 6.3% per annum for 2007\u20132015 and 4.1% for 2016\u20132026 were assumed as per \nthe Feasibility Study . \n \n1.  Traffic Trends \n \n8.  Traffic growth includes traffic of passenger vehicles, buses, and cargo trucks generated \nwithin the project area. The forecasts were performed based on an aggregate highway model of \nthe road network using the traditional \u201cfour-step\u201d traffic forecasting process: \n \n(i)  Socioeconomic development. As a first step, three economic growth scenarios \nwere  established  (low,  medium,  and  high)  for  the  project  area,  using  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and gross industrial and agricultural output data. The \nmedium scenario was used for traffic forecasts.  \n \n(ii)  Trip generation.

This is the process by which the trips generated are linked \nand a TAZ trip table is created showing the trip interchanges between every pair of \nTAZs. \n \n(iv)  Traffic assignment. To assign the trips from the trip table to the roadway network, \none particular route of travel through the network from various TAZs is selected. \nThe process takes account of drivers\u2019 reactions to changes in vehicle operating \ncosts (VOCs), travel time, toll charges, and other factors. \n ", "    Appendix 12   49\n2.  Diverted Traffic \n \n9.  With the construction of the proposed expressway, it is anticipated that a significant \nvolume of the traffic currently using the G108 highway, which is increasingly overloaded, would \nuse the expressway instead. \n \n3.  Shift from Railroad \n \n10.  The  Hou-Xi  Railroad  runs  parallel  to  the  proposed  expressway  and  has  a  freight \ntransport capacity of 18 million tons per year. It carries predominantly long-distance, large-\nvolume, bulky, and heavy freight like coal and steel products, with only  a small number of \npassenger movements. No major freight transport is anticipated to shift from the railroad to the \nproposed expressway, because that would be economically infeasible. However, it is projected \nthat the expressway will attract quite a few of the railroad\u2019s passenger movements by virtue of \nits shorter travel time, convenience, and flexibility. The passenger trains of this area operate at \nan average speed of 49\u201351 km/hour,  far slower than the speed of highway vehicles. The \nforecast for the modal shift was conducted primarily using travel time and cost difference \nbetween highway and railroad in the same O-D pairs within the project area. \n \n4.  Induced Traffic \n \n11.  The induced traffic takes into account potential traffic growth created by the changes in \neconomic and industry structure of the region as a result of the construction of the expressway. \nFor example, new industries may be established in the project corridor. Traffic growth may also be \ninduced by better transportation conditions (lower costs, shorter travel time, etc.) provided by the \nexpressway. \n \n5.  Traffic Volumes under Without-Project Conditions \n \n12.  The traffic volumes on G108 were projected under  without-project conditions for three \nscenarios (high, medium, and low). Table A12.4 below presents the medium case. G108, which is \nalready operating beyond the design capacity, is getting more and more seriously overloaded with \ntime.  The  road  passes  through  many  densely  populated  commercial  areas,  townships  and \nvillages, and small industrial enterprises without access control, with many buildings, vehicle \nservice and fueling stations, and even schools are located adjacent to the roadway. As a result, \nserious congestion and traffic accidents have long been a major problem in the area. The Project \nis essential to solve the problem. \n \nTable A12.4: Projected Traffic Volumes Without the Project \n(vehicles/day) \n \n  Length           \nRoad Segment  (km)  2007  2010  2015  2020  2026 \n             \nHouma-Xinjiang  13  21,487  26,286  34,309  42,398  51,334 \nXinjiang-Jishan  28  23,409  28,638  37,377  46,191  55,926 \nJishan-Hejin  28  17,648  21,590  28,178  34,823  42,162 \nHejin-Yumenkou  18  18,104  22,148  28,907  35,723  43,252 \nWeighted Average  86  20,170  24,675  32,206  39,800  48,188 \n ", "50       Appendix 13 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n \n1.   The financial rate of return (FIRR) for the project expressway is based on estimated \nincremental revenues and costs resulting from its operation. The major assumptions used in \ncalculating the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) are as follows: \n \n(i)   The FIRR calculation is in constant 2002 prices. The cash flows and financing \nplans are in real prices. They cover a period of 24 years, comprising 4 years of \nconstruction (2003 to 2006) and 20 years of operation (2007 to 2026). \n \n(ii)   The FIRR was calculated after corporate income tax. \n \n(iii)   Capital  costs  include  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the \nconstruction  and  equipment  of  the  project  expressway,  but  exclude  price \ncontingency provisions and interest during construction. \n \n(iv)   Operation and maintenance costs include all incremental costs for operating the \nproject expressway, but exclude depreciation provisions. \n \n(v)   Operating revenues were projected based on forecast traffic for the toll rates for \nall vehicle types in real terms. The toll rates were applied to the whole project \nexpressway and the Yellow River Bridge in real terms during the period of \nanalysis. The traffic volumes have taken into account vehicles that are exempt \nfrom tolls, such as military, emergency, and public security vehicles. \n \n2.   The results of the financial evaluation for the project expressway component show an \nFIRR in real terms of 7.6% after corporate income tax (Table A13.1). This is higher than the real \nafter tax weighted average cost of capital for the Project estimated at 3.7%. Sensitivity analysis \nof the financial return was carried out to test the effects of several scenarios on key parameters \nthat determine costs and revenues (Table A13.2). The FIRR after tax varies between 3.8% and \n9.7%, which is mostly above the after tax weighted average cost of capital. The Project is shown \nto be most sensitive to the toll revenue stream and capital costs and the delay in completion. An \nincrease of 20% in capital costs will decrease the FIRR to 6.0% and a decrease of 20% in \nrevenues will decrease the FIRR to 5.6%, and a 1-year delay in construction will decrease the \nFIRR  to  7.0%.  Under  the  most  adverse  scenario  (1-year  delay;  capital,  operation,  and \nmaintenance costs higher by 20%; and revenues lower by 20%) the FIRR would decrease to \n3.9%. A devaluation of the yuan by 30% would reduce the FIRR to 6.4%.

Project Costs and Benefits \n \n1.  The basis for project evaluation is a comparison of benefits and costs between the with-\nproject (base) case and  the without-project case. The project analysis period is 20 years \nfollowing expected full operation by 2007. The project construction period is 4 years, from 2003 \nto the end of 2006. For details, refer to Supplementary Appendix N. \n   \n2.  Costs. Economic costs are at 2002 prices and are expressed in domestic currency. For \ntradable items, an exchange rate of CNY8.28 per $1.00 and a shadow exchange factor of 1.08 \nwere used. The capital costs of the expressway and bridge component of the Project were \nadjusted  to  economic  terms.  Economic  costs  total  CNY2,197.7  million.  Border  prices  of \nimported goods and materials were adjusted to domestic price equivalents using shadow \nexchange rate factors in accordance with the domestic price numeraire. The capital costs were \nalso adjusted to eliminate price inflation, interest during construction, and taxes. Economic costs \nalso reflect the opportunity cost of land, and the shadow price for unskilled labor\u2014in surplus in \nthe project area.  \n \n3.  Benefits. The main economic benefits generated by the project are vehicle operating \ncost (VOC) savings, reduced travel time, and cost savings due to reduced accidents. Other \nbenefits include freight cost savings and resource cost savings arising from diversion of freight \nfrom  rail  to  highway.  The  benefits  from  a  reduction  in  number  and  severity  of  accidents \nconstitute an important element of economic benefits. Accident reductions were estimated \nbased  on  data  from  the  Highway  Planning  and  Design  Institute  of  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications (Table A14.1). \n \nTable A14.1: Accident Rates and Costs in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)  \n(2002 prices) \n \n  Average Value of Direct  Number of Accidents \n  Property Damage Per  Per 100 Million \nRoad Class  Accident (CNY)  Vehicle-Kilometers \nExpressway  17,780  20\u201350 \nMotorway Class I  12,700  55\u201370 \nMotorway Class II  9,843  105\u2013120 \nHighway Class I  8,255  150\u2013160 \nHighway Class II  5,715  More than 160 \n \nB.  Results \n \n4.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 16.17% indicating that the \nProject is economically viable (Table A14.2). The EIRRs of the expressway and the local road \nprogram  are  15.99%  and  21.58%,  respectively.  VOC  savings  amount  to  90.7%  of  total \neconomic benefits, while benefits from reduced travel time and reduced accidents each account \nfor 4.5% and 4.8%, respectively. The sensitivity of the EIRR to various changes in costs and \nbenefits is not of major significance. If capital costs were to increase by 20%, EIRR would only \ndecrease by 2%. Should economic benefits decrease by 20%, then EIRR would be reduced to \n14.06%. The impact of a 20% reduction in benefits along with a 20% increase in capital costs \nwould decrease EIRR to 11.84%. Switching values are identified based on a 12% discount rate. ", "    Appendix 14           5  3\nCapital costs would need to increase by 48% in order for EIRR to be reduced to 12%. Similarly, \nbenefits would have to be decreased by 32% for EIRR to be reduced to 12% (Table A14.3).  \n \n5.  As expressway tolls increase, more drivers and operators will opt to use other routes. \nHowever, there is no close alternative by which the Yellow River\u2014connecting Shanxi and \nShaanxi provinces\u2014can be crossed. Therefore, it is expected that demand for expressway \ntravel would be highly inelastic and increases in toll fees would have minimal effects on the \nnumber of vehicles traveling on the expressway.

Agreement \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the PRC: Yes, through improved access for the poor in the \nproject area, increased agricultural production/activities, employment opportunities during and after construction, and \nincreased social services to the poor. Details on poverty reduction and social impact analyses are given in \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: Other \n \nThe analysis concludes that 48,365 poor people will be directly affected by the Project, accounting for 4.8% of the \ntotal population (1 million) in the project area. However, it was observed that a high percentage of people have an \naverage income just slightly above the poverty line. Based on an income distribution analysis it was observed that \nabout additional 6% of the total population of the project area are vulnerable, earning annual incomes between \nCNY1,001 to CNY1,300 in rural areas and CNY3,001 to CNY3,300 in urban areas. As per the loan classification \nsystem, the Project belongs to  the  \"Other\"  category.  Nevertheless,  the  Project  will  provide  new  economic \nopportunities for the poor in the project area. For the expressway, about 2,340 person-years of job opportunities \nwithin the unskilled labor category can be provided.  Total additional income for these poor unskilled laborers is \nestimated around CNY17 million during the construction phase. For the local roads, about 260 person-years of \nemployment for unskilled poor laborers can be made. Total additional income for these poor laborers is estimated to \nbe around CNY2.0 million. In addition, economic benefits arising from increased land cultivation and other agricultural \nactivities, through improved accessibility, will be a 19% of incremental incomes in the project area. For details, refer \nto Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared                 Yes \n \nDuring the preparation of the Project, Shanxi Hou-yu Expressway Construction Company Limited (SHEC) undertook \nseveral opinion surveys, socio-economic surveys, and public meetings which raised the level of awareness, gained \nlocal support, and enabled stakeholders to voice opinions and suggestions for project design and implementation. \n \nParticipation strategy: For the selection of unskilled labor in the project area, the external monitoring agency will \nidentify appropriate team leaders in poor natural villages in the project area and train them as deemed necessary. \nThe team leaders will then select a labor team from poor households in his/her natural village. The county \ngovernment, the Executing Agency, and the external monitoring agency will coordinate the signing of the contracts \nbetween the contractors and the team leaders from poor villages.           \n       \n \nD.

Introduction \n \n1.  The reforms of 1978 have resulted in rapid growth of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) economy, and a corresponding increase in the demand for transport services. On the \nother hand, people and their surroundings are faced with the increasingly serious problem of \nroad safety and vehicle emissions, which inhibit the economic and social development of the \nPRC. They are associated with millions of premature deaths and injuries, high medical costs, \nstrain in welfare service, and reduction of productivity. Many of the problems encountered with \nroad safety and vehicle emissions are predominantly institutional in nature, with fragmentation \nof  responsibility,  lack  of  interdepartmental  coordination,  inadequate  data  systems  and \nmonitoring,  inadequate  action  plans  and  integrated  strategy,  inadequate  enforcement  and \nlegislation,  lack  of  road  safety  audit  and  accident  black  spot  programs,  a  weak  vehicle \ninspection system, and a shortage of skilled staff and resources. For improvement of air quality \nin Shanxi, an advisory technical assistance (TA) was provided to the PRC in 1999.1 To improve \ntraffic safety in PRC, an advisory TA was approved in 1999.2 For reduction of vehicle emissions, \na regional TA was approved in 2000.3 ADB will continue its dialogue with the PRC Government \nto facilitate the implementation of the national action plans to be proposed under these TAs. \n \nB.  Road Safety \n \n2.  Accident rates in PRC are very high compared with highly motorized countries and \nDMCs of the region. Official statistics indicate that there were 616,971 road accidents, killing \n93,853 and injuring 418,721, in 2000, up 49%, 12%, and 46% respectively from the previous \nyear. A recent study4 concluded that the economic cost of traffic accidents in the PRC may be \nas high as $2 billion per year, while another study5 indicates that underreporting of traffic \naccident fatalities in the PRC may be about 42%. Most accidents are associated with driver \nbehavior, speed, alcohol intake, pedestrian action, and road conditions.6 There are no readily \navailable data on comparative accident rates for various classes of road in Shanxi. The lack of \ncoordination between departments and the poorly maintained traffic accident data are seriously \nhampering meaningful traffic safety reforms in the PRC. In 2000, Shanxi recorded 16,344 road \naccidents, involving 2,414 fatalities and 11,721 injuries. There was a rise of 13% in accidents over \nthe previous year and accidents increased at a higher rate than traffic volume growth (about \n9.4%), due to the poor condition of the roads \n \n1.  Traffic and Road Design Standards \n \n3.  Safety  is  one  of  the  major  factors  which  should  be  taken  into  consideration  in \nconjunction with others such as mobility, economy, and environmental impacts, to achieve \nbalanced  design  standards.8  The  geometric  design  of  the  expressway  should  be  chosen \ncarefully to ensure that speed limits are chosen to suit the geometric design rather than the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

It is recommended that the service/rest areas, if they are close \nto  significant  crossroads  and  towns,  be  used  also  as  long-distance  bus  stops  to  provide \nconvenient services for passengers. Monitoring of overloaded vehicles will help reduce traffic \naccident  risk,  pavement  damage,  and  maintenance  cost.  Road  safety  audits  should  be \nundertaken during design and construction. \n \n2.  Organizational Structure \n \n4.  The two organizations concerned with road safety and enforcement of the existing \nexpressways in Shanxi are the Expressway Subdivision of the Traffic Police of the Shanxi \nPublic  Security  Department  (SPSD)  and  the  Enforcement  and  Emergency  Division  of  the \nExpressway Companies. Shanxi has a road safety council, which investigates all types of \naccidents and produces draft provincial codes and standards for accident prevention. While \nestablishing the council is a significant step, there is a need to enhance the authority of this \ncouncil to play more proactive role in coordinating road safety across the province.  \n \n3.  Interdepartmental Coordination and Action Plan  \n \n5.  It is necessary to establish an interdepartmental framework to enhance road safety in \nthe province. While  Shanxi Hou-yu Expressway Construction Company Limited (SHEC) will \nconcentrate on the engineering, road safety audit,  black spot, and operational issues of the \nexpressway, involvement of  SPSD is essential. SHEC will establish a working relationship \nstrategy with  SPSD to implement safer and better expressway operations. The strategy will \nseek to promote innovative ways to improve road safety through the following broad-based \napproach  (i) institutional  strengthening:  strengthen  the  provincial  road  safety  council  by \nestablishing an interdepartmental executive group; develop comprehensive action programs, \ntechnical studies, and modalities for greater leadership and awareness; and improve the policy \nand regulatory framework and effective monitoring; (ii) capacity building and human resources \ndevelopment: set up an effective and uniform database; and upgrade skills and knowledge, and \nroad  safety  research;  (iii)  provincial  cooperation:  develop  potential  common  projects  and \nactivities, conduct regional workshops, disseminate best practice, and strengthen linkages in the \nnational program; and (iv) create an effective coordination approach through government and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), the private sector, and community groups. This will be \nachieved  through  (i) a  computerized  accident  and  enforcement  reporting  and  monitoring \nsystem; (ii) development of a strategy framework and performance indicators; (iii) staff training; \nand (iv) strengthening the role of the provincial road safety council.  \n \n6.  An implementation plan is required to promote an efficient road safety strategy in the \nprovince, and for the expressway. An integrated approach may be adopted to facilitate the \nimplementation of the action plan by involving  SCD and SPSD. Insurance companies,  the \nprivate sector, and NGO groups can also be involved. This will result in: (i) reduction of \naccidents;  (ii)  reduced  demand  on  emergency  and  hospital  services;  and  (iii)  improved \nproductivity. Formulation of a better  system and other measures will generate revenues to \nsupport the program. Modification of the vehicle-testing centre also will provide some funds to \nsupport  the  proposed  program.  A  road  safety  specialist  in  safety  strategy  development, \nenforcement management, prevention measures, socioeconomic cost, and critical issues of \nsuccessful road safety programs will assist SPSD and SHEC for a period of 2 person-months. \nThe specialist will (i) develop a general provincial road safety implementation plan covering all ", "60 Appendix 16 \nkey issues; and (ii) formulate a road safety strategy for the project area, e.g., Hejin, Jishan, and \nXinjiang. \nC.  Vehicle Emissions \n \n7.  Motor vehicle emissions are a significant contributor to air pollution. The fragmentation of \nresponsibility, lack of interdepartmental coordination, together with inadequate base data and \nmonitoring system prevent the formulation of any specific targets for reduction in key pollutants \nsuch as CO, NO , PM , and nonmethane  hydrocarbons  (NMHC). Given these conditions, \nx 10\nSHEC and the Yuncheng Environmental Protection Bureau will proceed with the planning for a \nvehicle  emissions  control  implementation  plan.  Implementing  such  a  program  will  require \ncooperative effort among a number of agencies, jurisdictions,  and communities as well as \ngovernment commitment and leadership. The recommended approach is to implement a pilot \nvehicle emission testing and certification program, focusing initially on diesel trucks,  buses, \ntaxis, and  later on for  all vehicles. The program then could be assessed and adapted for \nareawide implementation. The pilot program could include (i) identification of vehicle types; (ii) \nestablishment of vehicle inspection sites; (iii) building more CNG filling stations; (iv) a public \nawareness campaign regarding the inspection timetable for vehicles, based on license plate \nnumbers and advertisement of economic incentives, e.g., toll reductions for certified vehicles; \n(v) an intensive training program and capacity building focusing on emissions testing, and data \nanalysis and reporting; (vi) an annual air quality monitoring program; (vi) media, NGO, and \ncommunity involvement; and (vi) establishment of an integrated provincial level emission control \ncouncil. \n \n8.  An implementation plan is required to promote  efficient  vehicle  emissions reduction \nmeasures in the province and in the project area. An integrated approach may be adopted to \nfacilitate the implementation of  the action plan. Various  agencies such as SHEC, Yuncheng \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau, and SPSD need to participate  in the implementation of the \nplan. Fuel companies, the private sector, and NGO groups can also be involved. Modification of \ncurrent programs of the environmental bureau and optimization of resources is necessary to \nenhance emissions reductions in the project area. Formulation of a better  system and other \nmeasures will generate some revenues to support the program. Further development of current \nvehicle testing centers to create an integrated vehicle testing system (both safety and vehicle \nemissions) will be a cost-effective method to support the program. \n  \n9.  A  vehicle  emissions  specialist  will  be  engaged  to  undertake  consulting  services, \ncovering emissions strategy development, enforcement management, prevention measures, \nsocioeconomic  cost,  and  critical  issues  of  successful  emissions  control  programs.  The \nenvironmental protection bureau will take the lead in implementing the strategies, provide the \nnecessary  services,  and  assign  senior  officials  to  ensure  smooth  implementation  and \ncoordination with all parties.  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20021121190356Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20030203094157+08'00'"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 November 2002) \n \nCurrency Unit  \u2013  yuan (CNY) \nCNY1.00  =  $0.1208 \n$1.00  =  CNY8.277 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nCSE  \u2013  chief supervision engineer \nCSEO  \u2013  chief supervision engineer office \nDCSE  \u2013  deputy chief supervision engineer \nEA  \u2013  Executing Agency \nEIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \nFIRR  \u2013  financial internal rate of return \nICB  \u2013  international competitive bidding \nIS  \u2013  international shopping \nLCB  \u2013  local competitive bidding \nMOC  \u2013  Ministry of Communications \nNTHS  \u2013  national trunk highway system \nPIA  \u2013  project implementing agency \nPPMS  \u2013  project performance management system \nPRC  \u2013  People's Republic of China \nRP  \u2013  resettlement plan \nRSEO  \u2013  resident supervision engineer office \nSCD  \u2013  Shanxi Communications Department \nSEIA  \u2013  summary environmental impact assessment \nSEPA  \u2013  State Environmental Protection Administration \nSHEC  \u2013  Shanxi Hou-yu Expressway Construction Company Limited \nTA  \u2013  technical assistance \nTOR  \u2013  terms of reference \nVOC  \u2013  vehicle operating cost \nWRDS  \u2013  Western Region Development Strategy \nYEPB  \u2013  Yuncheng Environmental Protection Bureau \nYWNR  \u2013  Yuncheng Wetland Nature Reserve \n \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \nkm  \u2013  kilometer \nm  \u2013  meter \nha  \u2013  hectare \nsq km   \u2013  square kilometer \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December. \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of: P.
