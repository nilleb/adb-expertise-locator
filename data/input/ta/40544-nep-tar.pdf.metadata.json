The Government of Nepal requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to \nsupport land administration and management in the agriculture and natural resources sector as \npart of its Three-Year Interim Plan 2007\u20132010,1 which follows the Tenth Plan 2003\u20132007. The \nGovernment\u2019s long-term policy in the Tenth Plan was to (i) strive for an efficient, service-\noriented, and informative land administration system based on modern technology; and (ii) \nincrease access of agricultural laborers to farmland, thereby contributing to poverty reduction in \nand rehabilitation of the target group. Under the Interim Plan, efforts are under way to develop a \ncomprehensive land management strategy as basis for a national land policy. In this context, \nthe Government initiated the modernization of the land administration system, to be followed by \nthe development of a comprehensive national land policy. Technical assistance (TA) in this \nregard was included in ADB\u2019s current Results-Based Country Strategy 2002\u20132007 and ADB\u2019s \nNepal Country Operations Business Plan 2007\u20132009.2 A Mission was fielded in June 2007 to \nconsult with the Ministry of Land Reform and Management (MLRM), Ministry of Agriculture and \nCooperatives (MOAC), National Planning Commission (NPC), Ministry of Finance (MOF), and \nother  relevant  agencies.  Following  subsequent  field  observations  and  meetings,  an  Aide- \nMemoire was issued setting out the goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Nepal is undergoing dramatic political changes as the decade-long conflict is coming to \nan end, and a new political agenda including a new constitution and an elected, inclusive \nGovernment is being formed. The people\u2019s movement removed the executive power of the \nmonarchy and reinstalled the political parties (including the Maoists) in April 2006. The recent \npolitical breakthroughs could yield significant dividends for the economy and increase the \nspace for political inclusiveness and economic growth. However, new conflicts are emerging as \nmarginalized  indigenous  and  ethnic  groups  demand  representation  and  autonomy  in  the \nprocess of state restructuring. The purpose of restructuring, according to the preamble of the \nInterim Constitution, is to resolve the \u201cexisting class, caste, regional and gender problems of the \ncountry\u201d  and  set  the  path  of  the  nation  toward  participatory  democracy  and  shared  rule. \nDemocratization of political power, cultural identity, and rights over land ownership and tenure \nare the basic driving force of the social movement in the terai (lowland belt of India). The \nGovernment recognizes that failure to respond to popular expectations and deliver tangible \ndevelopment results could jeopardize recent gains and undermine the peace process. Therefore, \nin the Interim Plan the Government is focusing on quick development impacts while at the same \ntime noting that complex reforms, especially major institutional restructuring and legislative \nactions, will be difficult to undertake. \n \n3.  The  political  developments  have  improved  the  prospects  for  sustained  growth  and \neconomic development. The gross domestic product is estimated at around 3.8% in 2007.3 The \ncountry\u2019s macroeconomic fundamentals remain generally sound. Both the budget and balance \nof  payments  are  in  surplus,  although  the  former  results  in  part  from  underspending  on \ndevelopment activities due to difficulties in absorbing capital expenditures at the local level, \ngiven the absence of people\u2019s representatives at district and village levels. The situation  is \nexpected to improve with political stabilization and the improved security situation in the country. \n                                                 \n1  Government of Nepal. 2007. Approach Paper to the Three Year Interim Plan. Kathmandu: NPC. (June).  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 July 2007. \n3  Nepal Resident Mission, ADB. 2007. Quarterly Economic Update Nepal. Kathmandu, April 2007. \n ", "2   \n4.  Although most Nepalese depend partly on agriculture for their livelihood, a significant \nproportion of the rural population either are landless or farm plots that are too small to generate \nadequate incomes. A large part of the population engage in agricultural activities either as \nsharecroppers or tenants, or must find work in rural nonfarm activities (which may include \nmigration) to supplement farm income. Nepal\u2019s land tenure system is based on owner-cultivated \nland, land leased out to tenants by landowners, and informal tenancy.4 In the case of owner-\ncultivated land, particularly where there are no reliable irrigation facilities, landowners do not \ninvest in land development and agricultural inputs because of the uncertainty of returns. In the \ncase of dual ownership (tenants having tenancy rights) and informal tenancy, landowners do not \ninvest and tenants, who are mostly poor, cannot invest. Tenants grow only one crop, leaving the \nland fallow during the rest of the year. Over the years, the number of formally registered tenants \nhas declined substantially while the number of informal tenants may have increased, with \ntenants reaching a personal understanding with landlords not to claim any tenancy rights. \nGenerally, landlords have been reluctant to involve tenants because they fear that the latter may \nclaim tenancy rights. There are no records on how much land is under informal tenancy in the \ncountry. These reasons have contributed to the low productivity of the land. 5  \n \n5.  Security  of  tenure  is  an  important  foundation  for  economic  development,  not  only \nbecause it helps  increase productivity, but also because fees and taxes on land are significant \nsources of government revenue. In addition, land is one of the main sources of collateral for  \nobtaining credit from established financial institutions such as banks as well as from informal \nproviders of credit. Securing land rights is relevant to vulnerable groups such as tillers, women, \nand  indigenous  groups.  Therefore,  distribution  of  land  and  land-related  resources  and  the \ndefinition of rights and responsibilities over them are important to Nepal\u2019s development. In \nbalancing the needs of competing demands, e.g., agriculture, industry, and forestry, efforts are \nunder way under the Interim Plan to develop a comprehensive land management framework \nand the appropriate legislation.  \n \n6.  Nepal\u2019s land administration system, which keeps the information on land and its owners, \nincluding tenants, is largely traditional. Information is acquired, stored, updated, collated, and \nretrieved manually in rudimentary fashion in paper form, with a low level of precision and high \nrisk of distortion and duplication. Consequently, land records are not reliable, land disputes are \ncommon, land registries are overwhelmed with associated problems, and integrated reliable \nland information is almost impossible to obtain. Land administrative services are costly for both \nthe government and the people. Moreover, the people are rarely satisfied with the quality of the \nservices.  \n \n7.  Because they are in paper form, the major land records are deteriorating due to storage \nunder  unsuitable  conditions  and  constant  handling.  In  addition,  there  is  no  provision  for \nrecovering many of these records in the event of disasters such as the destruction of land \noffices during an insurgency. There is no overall strategy for managing land records. While a \nsurvey map serves the purpose of a graphic index, lack of accuracy and geo-referencing could \ninhibit its future role in the spatial data infrastructure. \n                                                 \n4  Formal tenancy is official registration of a tenant in the land records or the \u201cmoth\u201d, whereas informal tenancy refers \nto tenants without registration. Tenancy registration provides the tenant with some security in his right to occupy \nand cultivate  land. \n5  Yadav, Ram Prakash. 2005. Land Tenure Situation in Nepal. Policy Outlook Series No. 7. Winrock International. \nKathmandu. \n ", "  3\n8.  During the last decade, MLRM has undertaken efforts and initiatives to modernize land \nadministration  and  develop  institutional  transformation.  The  focus  is  to  computerize  the \nalphanumeric data of the cadastral parcels, managed by district land revenue offices. The \nintegrated  land  information  system  (LIS)  aims  to  integrate  the  spatial  aspects  of  land \nadministration  data  managed  by  district  survey  offices.  In  2000,  the  Department  of  Land \nInformation and Archive (DOLIA) was established with the objective to manage all aspects of \nLIS.  \n \n9.  Currently,  DOLIA  is  pilot-testing  the  computerized  LIS  in  four  districts  with  varying \ndegrees of success; however, progress has been slow. There is a serious lack of trained staff to \nwork on the development and maintenance of the computerized system. In addition, funding \nshortages have delayed the engagement of contractors to carry out data collection work. The \ncomputerized system is still in a basic form and should be further developed to handle the \nvolume of work and also to add more functions. Currently, it is only an information system \nrunning as an adjunct to the manual system. It needs to be developed into a transaction \nprocessing system to aid all aspects of the work flow. In addition, the official procedures for land \nadministration, which were developed to suit manual processing, have to be reviewed, simplified, \nand standardized to suit computer processing. \n \n10.  The computerization effort to date has been ad hoc and seriously lacks structured \nplanning and clear strategies. There is a serious lack of an overall strategy for information \ntechnology (IT) in land administration. There should be an extensive review of the way the \ndepartment has been managing the resources to build and operate LIS. In addition to lack of \nclarity in overall goals, cadastral and land information standards (data, process, and technology) \nare nonexistent and must be defined before further data development. Other matters requiring \nclearer definition are overall management responsibility for spatial and attribute data, policies for \nland  information  access  and  sharing  between  stakeholders,  land  information  fees,  data \ncustodianship, and privacy. \n \n11.  The value and credibility of the computerized system currently being developed is being \nput at risk by the lack of attention  to the ongoing maintenance of the system. There is no point \nin developing the system unless there is a serious commitment to keep it continuously up-to-\ndate. In addition, proper procedures for backup of the data have not been established. This \nsituation is due in part to the lack of proper coordination between the agencies of MLRM \ninvolved  in  developing,  operating,  and  maintaining  the  system.  The  current  organizational \nstructure has contributed to these difficulties as it has resulted in overlapping and unclear \nresponsibilities of the departments concerned with the development and implementation of LIS. \n \n12.  The current organizational structure is also not ideal from the service delivery point of \nview. In most districts, the survey office is not situated in the same building as the revenue office. \nThe physical distance between the buildings isolates the two offices geographically, creating a \nbarrier to communication between them and making delivery of service to the public more \ncumbersome and difficult. \n  \n13.  Effective  land  administration  and  management  are  also  hampered  by  the  fact  that \nreferences to the legislation governing land administration are scattered among many laws and \nare outdated. Proper compliance with and enforcement of the laws are therefore difficult. The \nlaws need to be reviewed to consolidate and update them. \n ", "4   \n14.  Summing it up, an efficient land policy and a system of land administration have to be \nbased  on  clear,  equitable,  and  consistent  policies  and  laws  supported  by  an  appropriate \ninstitutional structure, and coherent business and IT processes. All those will ensure a cost-\neffective, fair, and sustainable national land titling and registration system, and the associated \ninstitutional framework for land administration. Consequently, there is a need for strategies for \ninstitutional  strengthening,  and  consolidating  and  adjusting  the  legal  framework;  and  a \nsystematic  approach  toward  land  use,  land  administration,  and  land  policy.  Given  the \ntransitional nature of current Nepalese politics, a complex reform agenda especially involving \nmajor institutional restructuring will take time to materialize and to be implemented. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n15.  The overall impact of the TA is its contribution to improved social justice and poverty \nreduction through the development of an effective land management system. The TA outcome \nwill be a more reliable, fair, and sustainable land administration and management process made \npossible by modernizing and improving business processes and developing a road map for a \nnational comprehensive land policy. This outcome is expected to increase the effectiveness of \nthe land administration system and, in the long term, improve social justice and the rights of the \npoor. The key outputs from the TA will be (i) a revised business process; (ii) a strategy for the \nfuture with the use of technology in land administration; (iii) accessible, secure, and upgraded \nland records; (iv) an action plan and costings to implement the strategy; (v) pilot testing of the \nstrategy in selected areas within districts; and (vi) a road map toward a comprehensive national \nland policy framework. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  ADB support is proposed for key areas where quick results can be achieved within a \nrelatively short time, but nevertheless supporting the longer term goals of the Government. The \nTA will concentrate the resources in two areas: (i) support the Government on how to move \nforward with a comprehensive national land policy framework that provides sound institutional \nstrategies  for  clarifying  and  documenting  rights  to  land,  and  managing  land  resources  for \nsustainable economic and social benefit; and (ii) using the basic LIS, in place, upgrade the \nsystem to improve business processes and work flows to introduce coherent standards, and to \nlink business processes for achieving synergetic results to share the benefits of an improved \nsystem with the service recipients, such as financial institutions, and municipalities for better tax \ncollection and urban planning purposes. \n \n17.   The TA will be provided in a collaborative manner between the different departments of \nMLRM  to  maximize  capacity  development  within  the  Department  of  Land  Reform  and \nManagement (DOLRM), Department of Survey (DOS), and DOLIA. The key activities of the TA \nare the following. \n \n(i)  Review existing work flows, processes, and forms in revenue offices and survey \noffices, and suggest improvements to assist the efficient processing of the work \nof these offices in both  manual and computerized form. \n(ii)   Work with MLRM to develop a strategy that includes a vision of the use of IT in \nMLRM and set out a path for achieving the objective. \n(iii)   Review current IT developments and assess their suitability for achieving the \nobjective of the IT strategy. \n(iv)   Work with MLRM to develop a records management strategy to establish good \npractices for storing and preserving land records. \n ", "  5\n(v)  Review the existing cadastral maps and assess their suitability for meeting the \ncurrent needs of MLRM in providing land administration services and also the \nfuture need for  infrastructure for national spatial data.  \n(vi)  In  close  cooperation  with  all  departments  of MLRM,  develop  an  action  plan  \nbased on strategies developed, including an overall financing plan. \n(vii)  Develop  pilot  systems  based  on  the  strategies  developed  and  test  them  in \nselected areas within districts. \n(viii)  Analyze the consistency and effectiveness of existing legislation governing land. \nReferences  to  such  legislation  are  scattered  among  many  laws  and  will  be \nreviewed for consolidation and updating. Recommend steps on how to develop a \ncomprehensive and consensual national land policy. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at  $400,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$350,000  to  finance  consulting  services,  purchase  of  equipment,  pilot  testing,  and \nmiscellaneous administration and support costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government\u2019s contribution, estimated at $50,000 equivalent, \nwill be in kind and will include office facilities, counterpart staff, and services. ADB will cover \nremuneration and per diem, international and local travel, reports and communication, contract \nadministration services, office equipment such as computers and software, and reporting costs. \nThe budget is attached as Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  International and national consultants and staff of MLRM will implement the TA.6 ADB  \nwill recruit the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Terms of reference for consultant engagement are \nattached as Appendix 3. MLRM will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MLRM will nominate a \ncore  group  of  counterpart  staff  in  DOLRM,  DOS,  and  DOLIA  to  work  directly  with  the \nconsultants. A steering committee will be formed to oversee TA implementation. The active \nparticipation of  NPC, MOAC, and MOF in the committee will be essential as the TA will address \na broad spectrum of issues that cut across many disciplines.   \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months with a total of 28 person-months \nof consultant inputs and is expected to be completed by December 2008. An inception report \nwill be prepared within 2 weeks of the start of the TA, and a summary progress report at \nmidterm. A draft final report including an assessment of achievement for key outputs will be \nsubmitted 1 month before TA completion. Tripartite meetings between representatives of the \nGovernment and ADB will review the consultants\u2019 inception report, progress report, and draft \nfinal report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for Strengthening Land Administration Services, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                 \n6  An international consulting firm, together with national consultants and MLRM staff, will implement the TA. \nSubmission of short technical proposals under the quality- and cost-based selection method is expected. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       \nImproved social justice  Access of excluded and  PRSP evaluation   \nand poverty reduction  relatively poor groups to  CAPE \nthrough the development  the benefits of a land \nof an effective land  management system, \nmanagement system  thereby improving their \neconomic and social well- \nbeing \nOutcome  A comprehensive land  TA completion report  Assumptions \nImproved processes of  policy framework    \u2022  Political stability \nnational land  developed    \u2022  Government\u2019s commitment \nadministration and a      to policy reform \nmanagement system that  An upgraded land  Country-level reporting  Risk \nis reliable, fair and  administration system  Results-oriented CPS  \u2022  Resumption of violent \nsustainable  developed  conflict and bandhs \n(strikes) \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

The land administration system in Nepal has two broad aspects: (i) information on land, \nincluding its geometric characteristics, i.e., cadastral maps; and (ii) information on landowners, \nincluding other socioeconomic characteristics, i.e., land registers called \u201cmoth\u201d. Two offices within \nthe Ministry of Land Reform and Management (MLRM) are involved in handling the two types of \ninformation as soon as the initial surveying work is done. The Department of Survey maintains the \nspatial part of the system while the Department of Land Reform and Management handles the land \nownership records. \n \n2.  The proposed overall goal of the project is to assist MLRM to develop an efficient, service-\noriented, and informative land administration system based on modern technology. The specific \nobjectives are to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the land registration and mapping \nservices, and to develop a road map for a national land policy framework. The national land policy \nitself is a long-term endeavor and is beyond the scope of this technical assistance (TA).  Such a \npolicy shall be closely linked to sectoral objectives and overall socioeconomic and governance \ngoals. It shall provide a sound institutional framework for clarifying and documenting rights to land, \nand managing land resources for sustainable economic and social benefit. Such a comprehensive \npolicy requires broad agreement to make it a consensual undertaking, which has the support of \npeople from all walks of life, the ethnic communities and the poor, and the less visible members of \nsociety.  To  achieve  this  consensus  necessary  for  trust  building  and  confidence  among  all \nstakeholders,  the  TA  will  come  up  with  clearly  defined  steps  toward  consensual  land  policy \nplanning, and how to develop a comprehensive national land policy framework guided by the \nprinciples of (i) broad-based consultation across government agencies, the private sector, and civil \nsociety groups; (ii) guidance and synthesis from a high-level advisory group; and (iii) cooperation \nwith international partners who are providing financial and technical resources for developing and \nimplementing the land policy. \n \n3.  The  consultants  will  work  closely  with  MLRM  and  the  associated  departments.  It  is \nexpected that a national steering committee will be formed upon the start of the Project, with  \nMLRM  as  head  and  with  participation  from  the  National  Planning  Commission,  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Cooperatives, and Ministry of Finance. MLRM will identify counterpart staff to work \ndirectly with the consultants. \n \n4.  The terms of reference (TOR) are outlined for five short-term international consultants \nNational consultants are also expected to be engaged on a short-term basis in the key specialist \nareas outlined below, to be determined by the team leader upon TA inception. For key specialist \nareas (i) to (iv), 4 person-months is provided for in the budget. Key specialist area (v) on land \npolicy road map development, with 12 person-months as the input, might require a wider range of \nconsultant expertise in land law, institutional reform, and consensus building. Other expertise may \nbe required in a key specialist area such as land database management and system architecture, \nand an international consultant for 1 person-month has been allocated for such input. The exact \ntechnical inputs will be decided based on the assessed needs at the TA inception report stage. The \nteam leader will provide the detailed TOR in the inception report.  \n \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n5.  The consultants will need to cover five interrelated topics contributing to the development \nand implementation of a modernization strategy for land administration within MLRM and a road \nmap  toward  a  national  land  policy:  (i)  developing  a  comprehensive  strategy  for  the  use  of \ninformation technology, (ii) reengineering office work flow and processes, (iii) developing a land \nrecords management strategy, (iv) reviewing cadastral mapping, and (v) developing a road map for \na  comprehensive  and  consensual  land  policy  framework.  The  costs  of  developing  and \nimplementing the modernization strategy will also be identified. Aspects of the strategy will be \ntested  in  a  selected  pilot  area  in  Kathmandu  (most  probably  Chabahil)  to  be  determined  at \ninception. \n \nA.
