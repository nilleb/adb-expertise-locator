Kawada. ", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in June 2002 \nidentified the weakness and ineffectiveness of the public sector audit function of the Federated \nStates of Micronesia (FSM). The Government therefore requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom ADB to support the strengthening of its public sector audit function. An ADB fact-finding \nmission visited FSM in September 2004. Discussions were held with representatives of the \nGovernment and other concerned parties, and an understanding was reached on the objectives, \nscope, implementation and other arrangements of the proposed TA. The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The FSM economy is dominated by the public sector, and a major financing source to \nsupport the public sector is the economic assistance under the Compact of Free Association2 \nbetween FSM and the United States. Under the amended Compact, FSM is required to manage \nfunds in a more accountable and transparent manner. Government audit offices should play a \ncritical role in fulfilling this requirement. \n \n3.  The Office of the Public Auditor (OPA) is an independent audit office for the national \nGovernment. Currently, OPA conducts operational audits and fraud investigations, while single \naudits  are  outsourced  through  an  external  audit  firm.  The  mandate  of  OPA  is  to  audit \ngovernment departments and agencies as well as publicly-owned enterprises. In recent years, \nOPA  conducted  audits  of  the  FSM  Postal  Services,  the  Rural  Development  Authority,  the \nPohnpei outer island airport, and the national biodiversity strategy action plan, among others. \nOPA is a member of the South Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions and the \nAssociation of Pacific Island Public Auditors (APIPA). In addition to OPA as the national audit \noffice, a state audit office exists in each state, in accordance with state constitutional mandates. \n \n4.  The coverage of the audit work is still very limited, due to insufficient institutional and \nhuman resources capacities. A few years ago, when the national public auditor position was \nvacant, only one audit each year could be achieved. Currently, four audits and 11 investigations \nare ongoing at the national level. The frequency of audits is insufficient to serve as a deterrent \nthat would encourage politicians and civil servants to comply with regulations and guidelines \nand prevent these individuals from participating in fraud-related activities. The audit office has \nthe authority to audit all public legal entities and nonprofit organizations receiving funds from the \nnational Government. However, lack of human resources means that the office has to be \nselective in its annual work plan.  \n \n5.  The  public  auditor  undertakes  investigative  work  based  on  tips  from  confidential \ninformants as well as requests from various government agencies. However, most complaints \nrelate to the misuse and misappropriation of government assets. With only two people in the \noffice trained to investigate financial fraud, the number of investigation requests to which the \naudit office can respond to is limited. The absence of a chief investigator resulted in increased \ntime requirements to complete investigations, which resulted in inefficiency. \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 14 September 2004.  \n2 The Compact came into effect in 1986. Under the Compact, FSM received assistance over 15 years, until 2001, \nwith a transition provision for an extension of 2 years, until October 2003. The Compact was renegotiated between \nthe two countries and the amended Compact is now in effect for 20 more years, until FY2023. Under the amended \nCompact, the United States will provide a $76 million sector grant and a $16 million contribution to the Compact \nTrust Fund during FY2004. The contribution to the trust fund will increase by $0.8 million annually, while the grant \nwill be reduced annually by a similar amount. \n ", "2  \n \n6.  An external quality control review of OPA for FSM was conducted by APIPA in 2002, in \naccordance with the standards and guidelines in the Quality Control Review Guide established \nby  APIPA.  This  peer  review  revealed  the  weaknesses  and  issues  of  the  audit  office  and \nconcluded  that  OPA  was  not  in  compliance  with  general  audit  standards  and  field  work \nstandards for performance audits.   \n \n7.  The peer review pointed out that OPA needs to improve its audit standards in the areas \nof  audit  staff  qualifications,  audit  organization's  independence,  individual  auditor's \nindependence, exercise of due professional diligence in conducting the audit and preparing \nrelated reports, and presence of quality controls. \n \n8.  With regard to staff qualifications, few professionally qualified staff members are in the \naudit offices, and most staff members do not have sufficient educational and/or professional \nbackground related to audit work. Therefore, OPA is currently relying on foreign staff members \nto manage and supervise audits. Key staff member turnover is high, which results in constraints \nand inefficiency. The staff members in the audit offices have reasonable opportunities to obtain \nthe necessary hours of continuing education through classroom training. The United States \nDepartment of Agriculture Graduate School is the major educational institution providing a wide \narea of audit training, ranging from basic auditing and accounting standards to auditing for \nfraud. Some other institutions providing audit training to a lesser extent are the Institute of \nInternal Audit, the Association of Government Accountants, and the South Pacific Association of \nSupreme Audit Institutions.  \n \n9.  However, the peer review concluded that despite these short-term training courses, staff \nmembers need to significantly improve performance auditing skills, particularly in gathering \nevidence and documenting audit findings. The peer review stressed that on-the-job training \n(OJT) will be able to enhance performance audit skills of staff members. Recently, a few \nauditors received OJT for about 2 months at the Office of the Inspector General, United States \nDepartment of Interior. The OJT modality was well received by trainees. Longer periods of OJT \ncould have increased the effectiveness of the training program. While these training courses are \navailable to staff members in audit offices, a technically and financially sustainable training \nprogram tailored to auditors and investigative auditors in the country needs to be developed to \neffectively use the training opportunities.  \n \n10.  Quality controls over the audit work in FSM were insufficient. The general audit standard \nrequires each audit organization to have an appropriate internal quality control system in place. \nSufficient  audit  performance  tools  are  not  available  to  staff  members.  Internal  control, \ncompliance, and performance audit manuals do not exist. A manual for investigation is also not \navailable. These manuals and sample audit files could be used as references for best audit \npractices, providing practical guides for local staff members to upgrade their audit standards. A \nfinancial audit manual is currently available in OPA; however, the quality of the manual does not \nreach the generally accepted standard. The manual has only about 20 to 30 pages, as opposed \nto a few thousand pages for one in the United States. Reports indicate that the available manual \nwas not used in the audits. The general audit standards also require a periodic external quality \ncontrol review. However, OPA did not receive such a review within an appropriate time interval. \n \n11.  With regard to fieldwork standards for performance audits, the peer review pointed out \nthat  the  need  to  further  improve  planning,  management  controls,  evidence,  and  reporting \nstandards. The audits under the peer review had initial audit planning without a careful plan to \ngather data and information required for the audit. Without sufficient data and/or evidence, the ", "  3\nrecommendations tended to be general and less effective. Due to weak management control \nover the audits, audit report quality was less than satisfactory. Audit objectives were often not \nanswered  in  the  actual  audit  reports.  Evidence  was  sometimes  insufficient  to  support  the \nconclusions and elements of findings. \n \n12.  With increasing importance of accountability and transparency in FSM public sector \nmanagement, it is critical to reengineer the management and control mechanism over FSM \naudit offices, both at the national and state levels.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The goal of the TA is to assist the Government in increasing its accountability and \ntransparency  at  the  national  and  state  levels.  To  achieve  this  goal,  the  TA  will  focus  on \nenhancing the audit and administrative processes of audit offices necessary to effectively carry \nout productive and efficient audits. \n \n14.  The main outputs of the TA are (i) strategic plans of audit offices, (ii) performance audit \ntools necessary to perform accurate and efficient audit, (iii) strengthened human resources \nmanagement system, (iv) an FSM resource-sharing program among the national and state audit \noffices, and (v) the resulting reform plan of the national audit office adopted, as appropriate, by \nthe state audit offices. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA adopts a two-phase approach. The first phase is to plan and implement the \nreengineering process of audit management and administration of a pilot audit office, and the \nsecond phase will help other audit offices adopt such reform done by the pilot audit office.  \n \n16.  Phase 1: Pilot Project. The following activities will be carried out under the first phase \nof the TA: \n \n(i)  Strategic planning. OPA will be the pilot office to introduce various reform \nagendas, including introducing strategic planning, developing performance audit \ntools, and strengthening human resources management. In the first phase, the \nTA will focus on reengineering processes within OPA. First, a strategic planning \nsession will be held in OPA. The strategic planning process will be mission-\noriented, with an emphasis on the vision for the future of OPA and the values \n(including  principles,  standards,  beliefs,  and  actions)  that  members  of  OPA \nconsider important and feel that OPA should represent. The planning process will \nalso include a thorough situation analysis looking into, among others, OPA's \nstrengths and opportunities. Financial and human resources implications will be \nexamined. The mission statement and goals and objectives, as well as revolving \naudit plans, will be produced through the strategic planning process. \n \n(ii)  Performance audit tools. Detailed audit manuals, such as an internal control \naudit manual, compliance audit manual, performance audit manual, and financial \naudit manual will also be developed in the first phase. These manuals will serve \nas step-by-step performance tools that ensure that stringent audit performance \nrequirements are met and effective and efficient audits are completed. Clear and \n ", "4  \nconcise documented procedures will be established for the yearly updating of \nthese manuals. Each year, numerous rules, guidelines, pronouncements, and \nexposure drafts are released, and these must be incorporated into the audit \nmanuals. The TA will also develop sample audit files for each audit type, which \nwill serve as a training and compliance tool during the course of an audit. A \ndetailed  Compliance  Investigation  Division  performance  manual  will  be  also \ndeveloped. Due to the sensitive nature of this division and the high level of risk \ninvolved, a clear and concise operational manual should be designed to guide \ninvestigators through the investigation process. \n \n(iii)  Human resources management. The current human resources management \nsystem  for  the  audit  office  will  be  critically  reviewed,  and  an  employment \nperformance evaluation methodology and employment promotion and incentive \nprogram will be introduced. A training needs assessment will be also conducted, \nand an employee training program will be developed. The training program will \ninclude in-country training at local educational institutions and overseas training \n(e.g.,  OJT  at  audit  offices  in  relevant  countries).  The  TA  will  explore  the \npossibility of tying up with other bilateral development partners on the training \nprogram. As for human resources in the audit services in FSM, the TA will \npromote a staff resource-sharing program within FSM among the national and \nstate audit offices. A memorandum of understanding among the national and \nstate audit offices will be developed. \n \n17.  Phase 2: Adoption of Pilot Results by State. In the second phase, the result of the \npilot test in OPA will be presented and discussed with state audit offices for possible adoption of \nsuch reform at the state level. The adoption of the reform plan by state audit offices will start \nfrom a series of strategic planning sessions and is not expected to be costly, as most outputs of \nthe first phase will be easily modified to meet the needs of state audit offices. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $397,000 equivalent, with $250,000 in foreign exchange \ncosts and $147,000 equivalent in local currency costs (Appendix 2). ADB will provide $300,000 \nfor the TA. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  contribute  $97,000  equivalent  to  finance  the \nremaining local currency cost. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  OPA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \ncounterpart staff members in the national and state governments work closely with consultants, \nas part of institutional strengthening and capacity-building efforts in public sector audit function. \nA steering committee will be established comprising national and state public auditors and other \nofficials,  as  deemed  appropriate.  The  Government  will  also  provide  all  available  relevant \ninformation and will facilitate the collection of technical data necessary for the implementation of \nthe TA.  \n \n20.  A team of international consultants will be engaged by ADB to provide 10 person-months \nof consulting services. The team will comprise (i) a team leader with extensive experience in \naudit management (8 person-months), and (ii) a human resources management specialist (2 \nperson-months).  The  consultants  will  be  individually  selected  and  engaged  by  ADB  in ", "  5\naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its \nBorrowers. The detailed terms of reference are in Appendix 3.   \n \n21.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  8  months,  from  February  2005  to \nSeptember 2005. The team leader, to be assisted by a local counterpart provided by OPA, will \nbe responsible for coordinating the work of team members. The consultants will contribute to the \nprogress and final reports to be prepared by the team leader. Each consultant, will also prepare \na final report on specific achievements and lessons learned under the TA, covering his or her \nparticular area of expertise or responsibility. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Federated States of Micronesia for Strengthening Public Sector Audit \nFunction, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators and  Mechanisms  and Risks \nTargets     \n \nGoal       \nAssist the Government in  Increase resolutions of  Annual public auditor's \nincreasing its  critical audit findings to  reports \naccountability and  75% \ntransparency  \n \nPurpose       \nEnhance the  Pass peer review by  Peer review paper by  The independent status \neffectiveness and quality  2007  APIPA or any other  of audit offices is \nof audit and    relevant organization  maintained \nadministrative processes       \nof audit offices       \n \nOutputs       \n1.
