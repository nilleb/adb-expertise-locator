INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 1998, the Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank to \nhelp  carry  out  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  Philippine  education  sector.1  This  study \nsubsequently  became  a  major  input  into  the  work  of  the  Presidential  Commission  on \nEducational Reform (PCER), which conducted its deliberations from 1998 to 2000. Following \nthe release of PCER\u2019s report,2 the Government requested financial and technical assistance \n(TA) from ADB to support the implementation of PCER\u2019s major recommendations. A project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the Higher Education Development Project (HEDP) \nwas approved on 12 October 2000, in the amount of $998,000.3 HEDP is now in the final stages \nof preparation and is scheduled for approval in 2003.  \n \n2.  HEDP  will  implement  key  recommendations  contained  in  the  PCER  report  and \nPhilippines  Education  Sector  Study,  as  well  as  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Philippine \nDevelopment  Plan,  2001\u20132004  and  the  Medium-Term  Higher  Education  Development  and \nInvestment Plan, 2001\u20132004. A common recommendation is to rationalize the allocation of \nscarce resources to maximize public funding for basic education. The rapidly expanding public \nhigher education system is exerting considerable pressure upon the education budget. To limit \nthis pressure, fundamental reform of the higher education system in finance and governance is \nnecessary.  \n \n3.  One of the PPTA findings was that the capacity of the Commission on Higher Education \n(CHED) to spearhead a reform agenda is limited. The Government therefore requested advisory \ntechnical assistance (ADTA) from ADB to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CHED and \nprepare it to implement HEDP. A fact-finding mission for the ADTA was carried out in February \n2002, along with a loan fact-finding mission for HEDP.4 The Government has concurred with the \nTA framework (Appendix 1), implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The formal education cycle comprises only 10 years of basic education (elementary plus \nsecondary), postbasic education offering nondegree courses of varying lengths, and 4 years of \nhigher education covering degree-granting courses. Almost all elementary education (grades 1\u2013\n6) is publicly provided, but 25% of secondary (grades 7\u201310) and 75% of higher education \nenrollment is in the private sector. Participation rates and gender equity at all levels are among \nthe highest in the region, and the workforce is relatively well educated. Nevertheless, the public \nperception is that the quality of education at all levels has declined significantly in recent \ndecades. In higher education, this view is supported by the 1999 and 2000 Asiaweek surveys of \nthe  80  top-ranking  regional  universities,  where  the  premier  university  (University  of  the \nPhilippines) ranked only 44th. As recently as the 1970s, the Philippines was seen as one of the \nregion\u2019s leading education centers. Average passing rates in the annual professional licensure \n                                                 \n1  ADB and World Bank. 1999. Philippine Education in the 21st Century.

Technical Assistance to the Philippines on the Education Sector Development Program. Manila. (TA \n3500-PHI, for $998,000, approved on 12 September 2000.)  \n4  The ADTA was originally conceived as an attached TA to HEDP but has now been de-linked from HEDP to allow \nstrengthening of CHED before HEDP implementation. \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 April 2002. \n ", "2 \nexaminations are also low, averaging only around 45%. The pervasive low quality of higher \neducation does not augur well for economic growth.  \n \n5.  Reform  is  urgent  to  redress  the  low  quality  and  pervasive  inefficiency  in  higher \neducation. First, the skills and competencies of graduates must be raised to prepare them for \nproductive work in the domestic and global labor markets, and thereby enhance Philippine \ncompetitiveness. Second, reform is necessary to enable the system to accommodate an ever-\nincreasing number of high school graduates, and to offer children an incentive to complete basic \neducation and provide them with a pathway out of poverty and into the labor market. To ensure \nthat  the  poor  are  provided  with  improved  employment  opportunities,  they  should  acquire \nqualifications  in  higher  education.  This  is  particularly  important  in  the  Philippines,  where \nparticipation rates in basic education are already high, and high school graduates are on \naverage only 16 years old. An efficient and effective higher education system is vital to ensure \nthese opportunities. Finally, in view of the budgetary situation, tertiary institutions must be \nweaned gradually from public funding and their resource utilization improved so that public \nfunds can be released for lower levels of the system.  \n  \n6.  HEDP responds to these imperatives by supporting reforms that will rationalize and \nstrengthen the higher education system while improving the poor\u2019s access to it. In the long term, \nimproved efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public resources will help ensure that pro-\npoor funding for basic education will be maintained or increased. HEDP has three general \nobjectives:  (i)  improved  efficiency,  to  rationalize  the  system  of  education  financing  and \ngovernance to improve resource utilization and help stem the uncontrolled growth in the number \nof  higher  education  institutions  and  programs;  (ii)  enhanced  quality,  to  improve  quality \nassurance and the quality of educational achievements and outcomes; and (iii) greater equity, to \nenhance access to higher levels of the education system among lower-income groups. \n \n7.  Higher education has always been led by the private sector. Over recent decades, \nhowever, public provision and financing have expanded rapidly with the establishment by the \nlegislature of many, generally low-quality, public higher education institutions (HEIs). As a result, \nthe private share of student enrollment has decreased significantly, from 90% in the early 1980s \nto less than 74% in SY2000/01. At the same time, the higher education system as a whole has \ncontinued to expand. In the last 7 years alone, the overall student population increased by 35%. \nPublic sector enrollments, however, increased by a massive 66%, compared with 27% in the \nprivate sector.  \n \n8.  This rapid expansion of publicly funded higher education has required large increases in \npublic funding for higher education. Between 1988 and 1999, the higher education budget \nexpanded by 23% while the basic education budget increased by only 5%. To reverse the \nresultant trend of a diminishing basic education budget share, the Government has for the last \nfew years pegged the higher education budget at around 15% of the total education budget. \nHowever, public higher education spending, as a result, has become increasingly inadequate to \nsupport the needs of the continually expanding public sector. Complementary reform strategies \nare urgently needed to increase cost recovery in public sector institutions, improve efficiency in \npublic spending, and contain or rationalize the growth of the public sector. In the absence of \nthese reforms, further deterioration in the quality and efficiency of public higher education can \nbe expected. At the same time, the viability of private sector institutions will continue to diminish \nas students are attracted by the low fees of publicly-funded institutions. \n \n9.  Responsibility for education is split among three agencies. The oldest is the Department \nof Education, which was formerly responsible for the whole sector. The department\u2019s focus \n ", "    3 \nchanged to basic education in 1994, when two new agencies were created to cover the other \nsubsectors of education: CHED, to oversee higher education; and the Technical Education and \nSkills Development Authority, to handle technical and vocational education and training. CHED \nis  legally  mandated  to  develop  the  quality  and  relevance  of  higher  education  through  the \ndevelopment  of  sound  policies  and  plans  to  promote  higher  education,  strategic  resource \nallocation,  standard  setting  and  quality  assurance,  and  establishment  of  an  appropriate \nregulatory environment for the private sector. In practice, CHED has focused mainly upon the \nminutiae of regulation.  \n \n10.  To  enable  CHED  to  champion  and  lead  the  reform  process  and  implement  HEDP \nsuccessfully, the agency must be strengthened. One of the most critical reforms is the move to \na new higher education funding system that will allow the systematic allocation of funds to public \nHEIs in accordance with national priorities. Stronger systems for quality assurance are another \ntop priority. To institute these changes and help CHED achieve strong leadership of the sector, \na comprehensive process of organizational development and capacity building is planned. \n \nIII.  THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to enhance CHED\u2019s capacity to implement the recommended \nreforms  through  a  comprehensive  process  of  organizational  development  aimed  at \nstrengthening CHED\u2019s role in policy development and planning, resource allocation, and quality \nassurance  in  the  higher  education  system.  The  strategies  to  be  followed  will  include \nrestructuring of CHED, improvement of operating systems, developing more effective strategies \nto deal with clients and other agencies, and targeting human resource development (HRD). The \noutputs expected are (i) a set of performance standards and monitoring mechanisms for CHED, \ncovering the central and regional offices; (ii) a more effective and efficient organization structure \nto allow the absorption of new responsibilities; (iii) a rationalized staffing pattern with more \nprofessional staff positions and an early retirement program for implementation under HEDP; \n(iv) new manuals of procedures decentralizing authority to lower levels in the system; (v) a 5-\nyear HRD program; (vi) increased staff capacity in areas critical to the success of the reforms; \nand (vii) more effective advocacy for reform. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  To ensure an effective program of organizational development and capacity building, an \norganizational analysis of CHED will be carried out. The first exercise will be a performance \nanalysis to (i) establish CHED\u2019s performance standards in line with CHED\u2019s core functions, and \n(ii) examine CHED\u2019s performance record to establish CHED\u2019s current performance against \nthese standards. With regard to new functions, the exercise will help establish performance \nmeasures and norms and allow the identification of specific gaps between current performance \nstandards and actual performance. The second step will be a diagnostic analysis to identify \nthe reasons for the performance gaps. The performance and diagnostic analyses will be carried \nout as group exercises with all CHED commissioners and top management to ensure that \ncommon understandings and agreements are reached. Some assistance will be provided by \nADB staff.6 \n                                                 \n6  The  concepts  of  performance  and  diagnostic  analysis  have  been  referenced  from  the  draft  guidelines  on \norganizational development being developed by the Governance and Regional Cooperation Division. \n ", "4 \n13.  The  major  factors  contributing  to  performance  that  will  be  examined  during  the \ndiagnostic  analysis  are  (i)  resources  (staff,  skills,  budget,  technology,  equipment);  (ii) \nmanagement infrastructure (strategies, policies, structure, and systems and processes); and (iii) \nvision, leadership, and values. The diagnostic analysis will be complementary to and informed \nby the initial institutional assessment carried out under the PPTA.7 This assessment does not \ninclude a specific performance analysis but thoroughly analyzes factors (i) and (ii). \n \n14.  Recommendations for specific programs of action will flow from the diagnostic analysis, \nand  from  the  initial  institutional  assessment  completed  under  the  PPTA.  Expected  major \nactivities are (i) reorganization of CHED\u2019s central office, including the establishment of a rules-\nbased financing unit, strengthened management of the higher education development fund, and \nnew  units  for  liaison  with  Congress  and  the  universities;  (ii)  development  of  a  normative \nfinancing formula; (iii) reorganization of CHED regional offices to strengthen technical expertise \nand prepare for decentralization; (iv) strengthening of planning capacities in central and regional \noffices; (v) development of a new staffing structure, including the design of an early retirement \nprogram and the cost implications; (vi) development of a costed, 5-year HRD plan capturing \nCHED\u2019s new roles; and (vii) implementation of a targeted training program, including training \nprograms designed by the consultants, and short courses provided by reputable Philippine \ntraining institutions in strategic planning, management information systems, quality assurance \nand its relationship to planning, project planning, and management.8 For courses costing less \nthan $15,000, the institutions will be contracted directly by CHED, and the funds for payment \ndisbursed  to  CHED  through  the  Advance  Payment  Facility.  A  detailed  training  program, \nincluding the names of the institutions, courses, and details of the participants, including their \ncurrent or proposed job duties, must be submitted to ADB for approval before implementation. \n \n15.  Selected, structured study tours will expose CHED commissioners and senior staff to the \nlatest  developments  and  best  practices  within  the  region  in  quality  assurance,  university \ngovernance, and student assistance schemes. Two short attachments to appropriate regional \nagencies in higher education financing and quality assurance will also be included to provide \nCHED staff with experience in these areas. Details of the participants, including their current or \nproposed professional responsibilities, itineraries, and plans for all overseas activities must first \nbe submitted to ADB for approval.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The total cost of \nthe TA is estimated at $770,000, of which $500,000 will be financed by ADB on a grant basis \ncovering the entire foreign exchange cost of $275,500, and $224,500 of the local currency cost. \nThe Government\u2019s contribution to the TA will be in cash and in kind, and will include the funding \nof training workshops and technical group meetings, provision of counterpart staff and working \ngroup  members,  local  travel  for  staff,  office  accommodation,  administrative  and  secretarial \nsupport, and use of printers and photocopiers. The Government\u2019s contribution is estimated at \n$270,000 equivalent. The detailed cost estimates and proposed financing arrangements are in \nAppendix 2.     \n                                                 \n7  Rodriguez, Rafael A. 2000.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented by CHED. An organizational development committee to be \nchaired by the Chairman of CHED will be formed to oversee TA implementation, guide the work \nof the consultants, and provide active input into ongoing work. The TA will be administered by a \nproject management unit under the Office of Policy, Planning, Research and Information. A \ntechnical  working  group  composed  of  external  stakeholders  from  the  private  and  public \neducation sectors will meet monthly to review TA progress and provide technical feedback. \n  \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 10 months (15 January\u201315 November 2003). As the \nprocess  of  organizational  development  will  be  highly  inclusive  and  participatory,  frequent \nworkshops, working group meetings, and field trips to the regional offices and some HEIs will be \nnecessary.   \n \n19.   The TA will require 15 person-months of local and 7 person-months of international \nconsultancy input in organizational development, HRD, quality assurance, and higher education \nfinancing. ADB will engage a consultancy firm on the basis of a simplified technical proposal, in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultancy firm will be \nselected using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedures. Equipment and furniture will \nbe purchased in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are included in Appendix 3. The findings and recommendations of the \nconsultants will be implemented and disseminated through the training activities to be led by \neach consultant. CHED will continue to advocate reform through national workshops with major \nstakeholders and the media, and in coordination with Congress. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \n \nthe Government of the Philippines for the Organizational Development of the Commission on \nHigher Education, and hereby reports such action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n
