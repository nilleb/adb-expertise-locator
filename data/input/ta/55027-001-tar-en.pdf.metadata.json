INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the Henan provincial \ngovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of \nthe provincial health insurance system.1 The TA is closely aligned with strategic priority 3 of the \ncountry partnership strategy for the PRC, 2021\u20132025, which aims to strengthen the PRC\u2019s health \nsystems.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Health-care reforms. As part of the efforts to build a healthy country, develop a people-\ncentered health-care system, and achieve universal health coverage, the government launched \na series of health-care reforms guided by the Healthy China 2030 strategy. The key reform \ninitiatives focused on developing health insurance, pharmaceutical supply and security, and \nhealth-care and public health systems and services.3 The reforms have focused on consolidating \nrural and urban residents\u2019 medical insurance schemes, expanding coverage, improving portability, \nraising benefit levels, and ensuring accessibility to the urban medical insurance system and \nservices.4 The government prioritized expanding the scope and health service package of the \nbasic insurance coverage; improving provider payment mechanisms; and increasing the financing \nlevel, fiscal subsidies, and reimbursement rates. The launch of the Medical Financial Assistance \nand Catastrophic Medical Insurance as supplementary health insurance to provide funds for \npatients in poverty or with severe illnesses, and the establishment of the National Healthcare \nSecurity  Administration  to  unify  the  management  of  health  insurance  schemes  further \nstrengthened the health insurance system.5 Payment systems are being reformed to modify the \nbehavior of health-care providers and to control the growth of health expenses, replacing fee-for-\nservice payment with comprehensive payment methods based on disease categories.6 \n \n3.  Health  insurance  performance  in  2020.  The  reforms  have  substantially  increased \naccess to health-care services, expanded health insurance coverage, and strengthened the \nhealth insurance system. In 2020, about 1.36 billion people were covered by basic health \ninsurance and the insurance participation rate reached 95% nationwide. Total annual basic health \ninsurance  fund  revenue  increased  by  1.7%  (2.4%  of  gross  domestic  product)  and  total \nexpenditure increased by 0.9% (2.1% of gross domestic product). The coverage of the Urban \nEmployee Basic Medical Insurance increased by 4.6%, annual fund revenue decreased by 0.7%, \nand expenditures increased by 1.6% over the previous year. Because of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19)  pandemic,  outpatient  and  emergency  service  utilization  decreased  by  16.7%, \nreported outpatient chronic disease cases by 8.8%, and the number of inpatient cases by 15.7%. \nThe average hospitalization cost increased by 6.5% and total medical expenses decreased by \n4.6% over the previous year. Urban and Rural Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URRBMI) \ncoverage decreased by 0.8%. Fund revenues increased by 6.3% and expenditures decreased by \n0.3%,  the  hospitalization  rate  decreased  by  1.5%,  and  average  hospitalization  expenses \nincreased by 7.1% mainly because of increasing tertiary health-care expenses.

Health insurance system challenges. Despite significant progress in reforms, the health \ninsurance system faces issues, including limited capacity of health-care security organizations to \nleverage contracting, develop and manage effective provider payment mechanisms, monitor \nprovider  performance,  and  contain  increasing  health-care  costs.  The  system  suffers  from \ninefficient budgeting and negotiation mechanisms between health-care security agencies and \nhealth-care providers; inefficient use of health insurance funds; and weak supervision, monitoring, \nand  governance.8 The  health-care  referral  system,  health-care  provider  performance,  and \npayment mechanisms must all be improved. \n \n5.  Health insurance, performance, challenges, and reforms in Henan. Henan is the third \nmost populous province in the PRC. In 2017, the provincial government consolidated the URRBMI \nschemes. In 2018, Henan was one of the four provinces with the largest health insurance fund \ndeficits, caused by rapidly increasing health-care expenditures. In 2019, to improve health \ninsurance management and services and control the rapid growth of health-care costs, the \nprovince launched reforms of provider payment mechanisms. Anyang, Jiaozuo, and Shangqiu \ncities became national pilots for the implementation of performance-based provider payment \nmechanisms. In 2020, basic health insurance coverage in the province increased by 0.58% and \nreached 94.9% in line with the country\u2019s coverage rate. The participation rate of the Urban \nEmployee Basic Medical Insurance increased by 4.28% and of URRBMI 0.05%. Annual insurance \nfund expenditures were 90% of the annual fund revenue, and health-care costs increased by \n1.86% over the year mainly because of increasing inpatient case treatment expenditures. The \n2020 pharmaceutical procurement cost decreased by more than 50% because of centralized \nprocurement (footnote 7). Challenges include increasing health-care costs and overspending of \nhealth insurance funds caused by inefficient provider payment mechanisms, an inefficient patient \nreferral system, increasing operational pressure on health security organizations, and weak \nsupervision and monitoring. As part of the national health-care reform program, the provincial \ngovernment  launched  reforms,  including  piloting  of  performance-based  provider  payment \nmechanisms, bulk pharmaceutical procurement, and other steps to improve health insurance \nsystem performance. \n \n6.  Policy framework. The PRC government has been responding to the challenges by \ndeveloping national policies and programs to strengthen the health care and health insurance \nsystems. The PRC\u2019s Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u20132025 aims to improve well-being by \ndeveloping a strong public health system, refining urban and rural medical service networks, and \nstrengthening  the  social  security system.9 The  General Office  of the State  Council  issued \nGuidelines on Deepening Reforms of Medical Security System, which provides key directions for \nreforming health insurance.10 The government developed the Healthy China 2030 Action Plan to \ntransform health care and improve well-being (footnote 3). In line with national programs to reform \nthe health insurance system, the Henan provincial government issued Guiding Opinions on the \nComprehensive Implementation of Total Budget Management of the Basic Medical Insurance \nFunds for Urban and Rural Residents, Guiding Opinions on Accelerating the Construction of a \n \n7  National Medical Insurance Administration. 2021. 2020 Statistical Communiqu\u00e9 on the Development of National \nMedical Security.

The national government has proposed Henan for the project \nto carry out health insurance case studies, data analysis, and development of demonstration \nopportunities, which can highlight best practices for nationwide application. \n \n7.  Strategic alignment. The project supports the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy \n2030 operational priority 1, on human development and social inclusion, quality jobs, education \nand training, better health, and social protection; and operational priority 6, on strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.11 The project will build on the lessons learned from ADB-\nfunded health sector projects and experience and ongoing cooperation with various agencies in \nthe PRC. \n \nIII.
