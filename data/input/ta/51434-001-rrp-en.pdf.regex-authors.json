THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Jiangxi Shangrao Early Childhood \nEducation Demonstration Program. \n \n2.  The  program  will  support  the  Early  Childhood  Education  Reform  and  Standardized \nDevelopment Implementation Plan, 2020\u20132035 of the Shangrao Municipal Government1 from \n2020 to 2025. It aims to increase the total number of children receiving quality 3-year early \nchildhood education (ECE) in Shangrao Municipality, which lags the national ECE goals. The \nproposed program is the first loan to comprehensively support a municipal ECE program and the \nthird results-based lending (RBL) program in the PRC\u2019s education sector. The program will be \nfully incorporated into the municipal government\u2019s upcoming Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u2013\n2025, and will provide essential support to narrow the gap in ECE outcomes between Shangrao \nand the rest of the PRC.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Although the PRC has achieved remarkable success in alleviating poverty, reducing \ninequality remains a challenge. Inequality reflects disparities in income and access to quality basic \nservices between rural and urban areas and between provinces and regions. Whereas high-\nquality ECE brings social and economic benefits, especially to children from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds, and reduces intergenerational inequality and poverty,3 such gains have largely \nbeen unrealized because of limited access to quality ECE, particularly in rural areas and for \ndisadvantaged children. Public funding for ECE is generally insufficient and depends on the \nmanagement and financing capacity of local governments, resulting in large disparities in per child \nfunding for ECE across municipalities and counties. Households bear the cost of ECE in the form \nof tuition and other fees regardless of whether ECE provision is public or private. This discourages \nlow-income families from enrolling children in ECE. Recognizing the gap, the Government of the \nPRC has been scaling up its efforts to expand the provision of 3-year ECE since 2010, through \nthe implementation of the first (2010\u20132013), second (2014\u20132016), and third (2017\u20132020) action \nplans for ECE development and through the national policy on ECE reform and standardized \ndevelopment (2018).4 \n \n4.  Shangrao is one of the 11 municipalities comprising Jiangxi Province, located in the \nsoutheastern part of the PRC.5 With mountains and hills accounting for 75% of its total land area, \nShangrao remains largely rural with an urbanization rate of 52%. It ranked second lowest in gross \ndomestic product per capita (CNY36,836) among the 11 municipalities of Jiangxi Province in 2019. \n \n1  Communist Party of China Shangrao Municipal Committee and Shangrao Municipal People\u2019s Government. 2020. \nEarly Childhood Education Reform and Standardized Development Implementation Plan, 2020\u20132035.

Beijing. \n5  The population in Shangrao was 6.81 million in 2018 (Shangrao Municipal Bureau of Statistics. 2020. Shangrao \nStatistical Yearbook 2019. Shangrao). ", "2 \nPer capita disposable income in rural areas has grown slowly to CNY13,346 in 2018, which is \nonly about one-third of that in urban areas (CNY34,656). The population living below the minimum \nliving standards (0.29 million or 4.3% of the total population) is concentrated in the rural areas. \nEthnic minorities (12,900 people or 0.19% of the total population) live mainly in the mountainous \nrural areas. Since the 1990s, Shangrao has seen large numbers of out-migrants, mainly from \nrural areas, to the surrounding municipalities with higher gross domestic product per capita, and \nconsequently, large numbers of children have been left behind by their parents. \n \n5.  Despite significant progress in the gross enrollment ratio (GER) in 3-year ECE, which \nincreased from 72.1% in 2017 to 80.3% in 2019,6 access to quality ECE has been severely \nconstrained, particularly in rural areas. The public provision of ECE has been uneven across \nShangrao and reached only 42.4% of all children enrolled in ECE in 2019. Filling a gap in public \nECE provision, private kindergartens have proliferated, accounting for 56.7% of all kindergartens \n(1,618 of 2,852). Yet the quality and affordability of private kindergartens vary considerably, with \nhigh-standard private kindergartens in urban areas charging fees more than four times higher \nthan public kindergartens, and substandard private kindergartens charging marginally higher fees. \nOut of growing concern over the accessibility, affordability, and quality of ECE, local governments \nsubsidize private kindergartens that meet their standards, while setting limits to the tuition fees \nthey charge. These kindergartens are classified as \u201cinclusive\u201d private kindergartens, and they \nenroll 43.5% of all children in ECE. \n \n6.  The limited access to quality ECE in rural areas also stems from ECE teacher shortages \nand a lack of qualified ECE teachers. The ECE teacher\u2013child ratio in rural public kindergartens \nwas as high as 1:25.2, compared with the municipal average of 1:18.1 in 2019. Almost half of \nECE teachers (43.7%) work without teaching licenses. Overall, the ECE teaching force in \nShangrao is weak, with only 7.9% of ECE teachers holding a bachelor\u2019s degree and above \n(compared with a national average of 23.9% in 2018) and 43.4% having senior secondary \neducation and below (compared with a national average of 18.1%). The main reason for the weak \nECE teaching force is low salaries and benefits, and challenging working conditions, which makes \nthe ECE teaching profession unattractive. Only 12.0% of ECE teachers, mostly working in public \nkindergartens in urban areas, have public employee status, while the rest work on a contractual \nbasis without the benefits enjoyed by public employee teachers and the prospects of career \nprogression.7 ECE teacher turnover is high and many local ECE teachers choose to work outside \nShangrao to obtain better salaries, benefits, and working conditions. \n \n7.  The current systems for pre- and in-service ECE staff (teachers, principals, and childcare \nstaff) are incomplete. The national ECE curriculum guidelines are yet to be reflected in the \ncurriculum of ECE teacher preparation programs. Moreover, existing in-service ECE teacher \nprofessional  development  programs  do  not  meet  the  practical  needs  of  ECE  teachers \nimplementing the national curriculum guidelines. Although professional development programs \nfor principals exist, they are organized on an ad hoc basis and do not consider the fact that most \nprincipals were selected from primary schools without ECE experience. There are no in-service \nchildcare  staff  training  programs  in  Shangrao.  Competency  standards  for  ECE  teachers, \nprincipals, and childcare staff do not exist to ensure the quality of training programs and guide \ncontinuous professional development. \n \n6  Accordingly, the number of children enrolled in ECE increased from 224,597 in 2017 to 235,115 in 2019.  The national \nGER average was 81.7% in 2018, which is generally considered on track to achieve the national GER target of 85.0% \nby 2020. (Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Ministry of Education. 2019. Overview of Educational \nAchievement in China in 2018. Beijing. http://en.moe.gov.cn/documents/reports/201910/ t20191022_404775.html.) \n7  The structure of senior, intermediate, and junior ECE teacher positions that applies to public employee teachers is \nnot applicable to most nonpublic employee teachers. \n ", "3 \n8.  The lack of qualified ECE teachers, principals, and childcare staff is compounded by the \nabsence  of  stimulating  learning  environments  rich  in  quality  ECE  support  and  resources, \nespecially in rural areas. As a result, the quality of ECE staff\u2013child interactions appear to be low, \nalthough  no  data  are  available  because  ECE  quality  assessment  and  monitoring  are  not \nconducted systematically in Shangrao. The municipal government\u2019s plan to expand the use of \ninformation and communication technology platforms in ECE has the potential to increase the \nquality of ECE support and resources and facilitate systematic quality assessment and monitoring. \nIn addition to kindergarten-based programs, home-based ECE and community-based parenting \nprograms may be necessary because many left-behind children and other disadvantaged children \nin rural areas are less likely to receive stimulation, care, and protection from stress at home and \nto enroll in kindergartens. Other countries and other parts of the PRC have adopted such models, \ntargeting children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but they have not yet been implemented in \nShangrao. \n \n9.  In April 2020, the municipal government approved the ECE Reform and Standardized \nDevelopment Implementation Plan, 2020\u20132035 (footnote 1), drawing on the national ECE policy \n(footnote 4) and Jiangxi Provincial Government\u2019s ECE Reform and Standardized Development \nImplementation Plan. The municipal government\u2019s ECE program aims to achieve universal \ncoverage  of  3-year,  affordable,  safe,  and  quality  ECE  by  (i)  expanding  ECE  provision, \n(ii) improving ECE financing mechanisms, (iii) strengthening ECE staffing and teaching force, \n(iv) enhancing ECE management systems, (v) improving regulations and support for private \nkindergartens, (vi) enhancing ECE quality, and (vii) establishing adequate ECE governance \nmechanisms. \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n10.  The program builds on the experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndevelopment partners with ECE and RBL programs in the education sector in the PRC.8 The \nprogram reflects lessons learned, including the importance of targeting disadvantaged areas and \nchildren, expanding ECE delivery models beyond a kindergarten-based model, assessing the \nquality of ECE, and strengthening program monitoring and management systems.9 The program \nis in line with the strategic priority of supporting inclusive economic growth (reducing poverty and \ninequality) set out in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020.10 It will support \nthe following key operational principles and priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 in accordance with \nADB\u2019s approaches to upper middle-income countries:11 (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities and promoting rural development by improving access to quality ECE, \nespecially in rural areas and for disadvantaged children; (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality by promoting girls\u2019 enrollment in 3-year ECE, labor force participation, and leadership for \n \n8  World Bank. 2016.

The use of the RBL modality is justified because the nature of ECE reforms in Shangrao \nrequires  a  comprehensive  system-based  approach.  The  program  will  involve  more  than \n2,800 public and private kindergartens across the 12 counties and districts of Shangrao, and \npreservice ECE staff preparation program providers. The municipal government shows strong \nownership of the program, providing $289.4 million (38.5% of the total financing, Table 4) and \ncommitment  to  results-based  planning  and  management  as  opportunities  for  system \nimprovement and institutional strengthening, which have been demonstrated in the ongoing \neducation sector RBL programs in the PRC (footnote 8). The Government of the PRC considers \nRBL as a means to push its reform processes. RBL leverages counterpart resources under a \nsingle results framework and expands the development impact of ADB financing, which accounts \nfor 13.3% of the total program financing. Due diligence assessments provide assurance for \neffective achievement of results through RBL, and measures to strengthen government program \nsystems are built into the program design.12 \n \n12.  ADB value addition. ADB\u2019s involvement in the municipal government\u2019s ECE program will \nadd value by driving policy and system reforms as laid out in the national ECE policy, which is still \nin the early stages of implementation across the country. Drawing on more than 25 years of \nengagement in the education sector in the PRC,13 ADB will bring knowledge, expertise, and \nnational and international good practices to support the reforms ahead of the other provinces and \ncities;  and  will  develop  replicable  models  and  practices  in  areas  such  as  professional \ndevelopment of ECE staff, ECE delivery, pedagogy, quality assessment, and research. These \nareas are also where global evidence remains scarce. ADB will support the development and \nregional sharing of knowledge, models, and practices under the program using centers of \nexcellence and knowledge platforms.14 ADB will design and conduct an impact evaluation study \nof selected program interventions on children\u2019s learning and developmental outcomes. \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n13.  The RBL program will be a time slice of the municipal government\u2019s ECE program, \ncovering 2020\u20132025, and will focus on key interventions designed to improve access to quality \nECE, establish pre- and in-service ECE staff professional development systems, and strengthen \nECE program monitoring and management systems. The scope of the municipal government and \nRBL programs is summarized in Table 1. \n   \n \n12 RBL is considered a suitable modality for programmatic interventions across extensive areas and covering a wide \nrange of activities that are difficult to deliver under a project loan. Unlike in a sector loan, key design elements of the \nRBL program, including capacity development and system strengthening, apply to the entire program. \n13 An overview of ADB\u2019s education sector operations since 1993 is provided in Education Sector Operations in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB entered into a knowledge partnership agreement with Peking University in 2018 to develop a regional \nknowledge base in education. Since 2011, ADB has organized eight international skills forums to exchange and \nshare innovative practices and solutions in education. \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Program Scope \nItem  Broader Government Program  Results-Based Lending Program \nOutcome  Universal coverage of 3-year, affordable,  Children receiving quality 3-year ECE \nsafe, and quality ECE achieved  increased \nKey outputs  Provision of ECE expanded, ECE financing  Provision of affordable 3-year ECE \nmechanisms improved, ECE staffing and  increased; systems for preparation and \nteaching force strengthened, ECE  professional development of ECE \nmanagement systems enhanced, regulations  teachers, principals, and childcare staff \nand support for private kindergartens  established; models and mechanisms for \nimproved, and adequate ECE governance  improving the quality of ECE developed; \nmechanisms established  and systems for assessing, monitoring, \nand ensuring the quality of ECE \nstrengthened \nActivity types  Physical infrastructure improvement,  Same as the broader government \nenhanced regulations and support for private  program, with a focus on key \nkindergartens, establishment of pre- and in- interventions to improve access to and \nservice training systems for ECE staff,  quality of ECE, establish pre- and in-\nrecruitment of ECE teachers and childcare  service ECE staff preparation and \nstaff, enhanced support systems for rural  professional development systems, and \nkindergartens, ECE research, and  strengthen ECE program monitoring and \ndevelopment of ECE quality assessment and  management systems \nmonitoring systems \nProgram  $3,350.4 million  $750.8 million \nexpenditure \nMain financiers  Government: $1,949.2 million, households  Government: $289.4 million,a households \nand the respective  (tuition and other fees): $959.2 million, ADB:  (tuition and other fees): $240.1 million,a \nfinancing amounts  $100.0 million, financing gap: $341.9 million  ADB: $100.0 million, financing gap: \n$121.3 million \nGeographic  Shangrao Municipality  Shangrao Municipality \ncoverage \nImplementation  2020\u20132035  2020\u20132025 \nperiod \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ECE = early childhood education. \na  Excludes financing from Dexing City, Hengfeng County, and Yugan County. \nSources: ADB and Shangrao Municipal Government. \n \nD.  Program Results \n \n14.  The RBL program\u2019s impact will be universal coverage of quality 3-year ECE achieved \n(footnote 1). The outcome will be children receiving quality 3-year ECE increased. More children \nwill receive 3-year ECE (disbursement-linked indicator [DLI] 1), whose quality will be enhanced \nthrough improved ECE teacher\u2013child interactions (DLI 2). The program will have four outputs.15 \n \n15.  Output 1: Provision of affordable 3-year early childhood education increased. The \nprogram will improve access to affordable ECE by creating more spaces for children in public and \ninclusive private kindergartens. The percentage of children enrolled in public and inclusive private \nkindergartens will increase (DLI 3). The program will also alleviate ECE staff shortages by \nattracting and retaining qualified ECE staff through increased government-financed ECE teacher \nand childcare staff positions with better salaries and benefits (DLI 4). All children from families \nliving below the minimum living standards will continue to benefit from government financial \nassistance to receive 3-year ECE. \n \n16.  Output 2: Systems for preparation and professional development of early childhood \neducation teachers, principals, and childcare staff established. The program will support the \nestablishment of competency frameworks for ECE teachers, principals, and childcare staff, based \n \n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "6 \non which ECE staff preparation and professional development programs will be updated or newly \ndeveloped. Candidates for ECE teachers and childcare staff who have completed competency-\nbased preservice education programs in Shangrao will increase (DLI 5). The majority of in-service \nECE staff will complete updated (for new and in-service ECE teachers) and newly developed (for \nprincipals and childcare staff) professional development programs that are aligned with the \ncompetency  frameworks  (DLI  6).  Moreover,  through  those  updated  and  newly  developed \npreparation and professional development programs, the percentage of ECE teachers and \nprincipals who have passed the national teacher qualification exam and obtained an ECE teacher \nlicense will increase. \n \n17.  Output 3: Models and mechanisms for improving the quality of early childhood \neducation developed. The program will support research projects to be conducted by an ECE \nexpert  committee  established  under  the  Shangrao  Municipal  Bureau  of  Education  (SBE), \ncomprising ECE teachers and principals of model kindergartens, and researchers from colleges \nand universities, to address pressing issues with access to quality ECE in Shangrao. The program \nwill also support the development and activities of professional learning communities led by \nprovincial model kindergartens and involving ECE teachers, principals, and childcare staff from \nparticipating kindergartens, to reflect on and improve instructional, management and leadership, \nand childcare practices as a mechanism for job-embedded professional development (DLI 7). \nMoreover, the program will pilot play-based learning reform to engage children in deeper learning \nexperiences (DLI 8) and community-based parenting programs in villages to reach out to left-\nbehind children and their caregivers, usually grandparents.16 \n \n18.  Output 4: Systems for assessing, monitoring, and ensuring the quality of early \nchildhood education strengthened. The program will introduce ECE quality assessment and \nmonitoring tools that focus on specific dimensions of ECE quality (program, and ECE teacher\u2013\nchild interactions) associated with children\u2019s learning and developmental outcomes. It will also \nimprove regulations for private kindergartens by applying strict licensing and registration. The \nprogram will expand the Smart Education Platform for primary and junior secondary schools to \ncover kindergartens for improved management and reporting (DLI 9).17 \n \n19.  To provide more focus on key results, nine DLIs have been selected and ambitious targets \nhave been set. Large portions (55%) of ADB financing will be allocated to outcome-level DLIs 1 \nand 2, which measure key dimensions of the program outcome\u2013\u2013improved access to and quality \nof 3-year ECE in Shangrao. By the end of the program, the GER will have increased to 88.0% \nfrom 80.3% in 2019, with 9,000\u201320,000 more children to be enrolled annually during the program \nimplementation  period.

Loans \nfrom commercial banks may be sought to fill the financing gap. The government will fund the \nprogram if loans or other financing cannot be obtained.18 The government has requested a regular \nloan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program.

Disbursement arrangements. Disbursement will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to an account to \nbe designated by the government based on the verified achievement of DLIs. Financing of prior \nresults achieved not more than 12 months before loan signing will be applied to DLIs 1 and 9.19 \nThe municipal government\u2019s ECE program, which the RBL program will support, has been under \nimplementation since the beginning of 2020, and measuring the achievement of the program in \nthe first year (DLI 1) is critical to gauge the level of efforts needed to achieve the DLI for the \nsubsequent years. The quality, reliability, and timely availability of disaggregated data (DLI 9) are \nalso crucial to monitor the program performance and quickly address problems as they arise. \nDisbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of DLIs. All DLIs should be achieved on \nor before the program completion date. Before the disbursement of loan proceeds, the municipal \ngovernment will prepare and submit, after approvals by the relevant government agencies, a \nwithdrawal application, along with evidence to support the achievement of the DLIs in accordance \nwith the verification protocols. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n25.  The program will support actions to ensure the achievement of its outcomes, including the \ndevelopment of measures to address issues with the accessibility of public and inclusive private \nkindergartens in urban, rural, and disadvantaged areas and improve the attractiveness of the ECE \nteaching  profession.  It  will  also  strengthen  the  program  systems,  notably,  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E), fiduciary, and safeguards systems, as well as gender and social inclusion. \nCapacity development activities are in the program action plan (PAP).20 \n \n \n19 The total amount of such financing will not exceed 20% of the total amount. \n20 PAP (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The Shangrao Municipal Government is the executing agency. Although this will be the \nfirst ADB loan for the municipal government, through World Bank-financed projects, it has \ndeveloped and demonstrated solid capacity to manage and implement challenging projects. The \nSBE is the implementing agency and will implement and manage the program through its program \nmanagement office in coordination with the 12 county and district education bureaus (CEBs). By \nimplementing the three action plans for ECE development and leveraging partnerships with \nShanghai Municipality,21 the SBE has proved its capability to quickly improve the GER to a level \nclose to the national and provincial averages and to adopt good practices. The municipal \ngovernment has established a leading group for the utilization of foreign loans, comprising the \nmunicipal government, the Shangrao Municipal Bureau of Finance, the Shangrao Municipal \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, the SBE, and other relevant bureaus, to provide strategic \nguidance and direction. An ECE expert committee is planned to be set up under the SBE to \nprovide technical guidance based on ECE research. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n27.  The municipal government\u2019s ECE program aims to implement the national ECE policy \n(footnote 4) through a wide range of interventions. Technical assessments concluded that the \nECE system in Shangrao needs to (i) develop measures and models to address issues with the \naccessibility of kindergartens in addition to building new kindergartens; (ii) develop and strengthen \nthe  ECE  workforce,  while  improving  the  attractiveness  of  the  ECE  teaching  profession; \n(iii) support ECE teachers and childcare staff in interacting with children in more meaningful ways \nand improving children\u2019s learning and developmental outcomes; and (iv) introduce ECE quality \nassessment and monitoring. The program results framework, DLIs, and PAP incorporate these \nfindings. Analysis of historical and predicted revenues, budgets, and expenditures, and results \nachieved in the past several years confirmed that the program expenditure framework and \nfinancing plan are robust. \n \n28.  Economic analysis. The benefits of quality ECE last a lifetime as it provides a basis for \nhuman  capital  accumulation  and  higher  labor  productivity,  and  improves  long-term  health \noutcomes. In rural areas, where many children are left behind when their parents migrate to work \nelsewhere and are cared for by their grandparents or other caregivers, quality ECE that provides \nnurturing care and support is essential. Parents who cannot rely on other caregivers also benefit \nfrom ECE as they can free up their time to work. The measurable economic benefits of the \nprogram include (i) increased lifetime earnings of children receiving ECE who are likely to achieve \nhigher educational attainment, and (ii) improved lifetime earnings of their parents whose time to \ntake care of children is freed up with the availability of ECE services. The program is deemed \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 8.3%, higher than the minimum \nrequired discount rate of 6.0% for social sector projects. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken for \na 20% reduction in benefits and a 20% increase in costs to reflect the potential impacts of the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Under this scenario, the economic internal rate of \nreturn drops to 6.8%.22 \n \n \n21 Shangrao Municipal Government entered into a partnership agreement with Shanghai Municipal Government to \nreceive support for ECE development in March 2018.  \n22 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n29.  Poverty, social, and gender. The program has a strong pro-poor and gender focus. It will \nbenefit children from low-income families, disadvantaged backgrounds, and rural areas who are \nless likely to receive stimulation, care, and protection from stress at home and to enroll in \nkindergartens.  Gender  analysis  revealed  gender  bias,  including  unreported  or  delayed \nregistration of female births; and a higher likelihood of girls enrolling in ECE later than the age of \n3, dropping out, or not enrolling at all. Moreover, because of gender stereotypes in childcare, and \nthe low salaries and social status of the ECE profession, men are underrepresented in ECE \nworkforce. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The program results \nframework, DLIs, and PAP include gender targets and actions to address the gender gaps in \nenrollment and ECE staff preparation and professional development. The program will enhance \nthe attractiveness of ECE profession by improving salaries, benefits, and working conditions; and \nproviding professional development opportunities and support for ECE staff. \n \n30.  Impact of coronavirus disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the closure of \nkindergartens and loss of jobs and household incomes, which have negatively impacted, in \nparticular, the operation of private kindergartens and the ability of households to pay tuition and \nother fees for ECE. The program will ensure the affordability and availability of space for children \nin  both  public  and  private  kindergartens,  especially  those  from  low-income  families, \ndisadvantaged backgrounds, and rural areas; and the quality of ECE in the context of post-\npandemic recovery where the municipal government\u2019s revenues, budgets, and expenditures may \nhave been affected.23 By ensuring that children receive ECE in kindergartens, their parents, in \nturn, will be able to work and restore household incomes. \n31.  Climate change impact. The climate risk and vulnerability assessment concluded that \nthe overall climate change impact on the program is low but identified intense precipitation \ncausing potential damage to construction sites and flooding as risks. Kindergartens and other \nfacilities to be supported under outputs 1 and 2 will adopt flood resilience measures, such as \nalarm systems and evacuation equipment, as climate adaptation measures. By conserving and \nreusing existing buildings instead of constructing new ones and adopting renewable energy (solar \nwater heaters) and one-star green building standards, the program will reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions by 381 tons per annum.24 \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n32.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The program M&E systems assessment confirmed \nthat, in general, robust M&E arrangements for ECE exist, although the following weaknesses \nwere identified: (i) lack of reliable data on the number of children aged 3\u20136 because of out-\nmigration and other reasons, which affects the method of calculating the GER; (ii) lack of data on \nout-of-kindergarten children and children that have difficulty accessing kindergartens; (iii) lack of \ndata  on  unregistered  private  kindergartens;  and  (iv)  limited  quality,  reliability,  and  timely \navailability of data disaggregated by lower administrative unit. The program will support the \nupgrading of the Smart Education Platform for primary and junior secondary education to cover \nkindergartens (DLI 9). The achievement of the outcome and some output DLIs will be verified \nthrough independent third-party verification in accordance with the verification protocols. The \n \n23 Kindergartens in Shangrao gradually started to reopen in late May 2020 with strict health, hygiene, and social \ndistancing measures. Since the municipal government commenced its preparation work for the program before the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and plans to start registering children for the next school year as usual following the reopening \nof kindergartens, no significant effects on the prior results are expected. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the \nmunicipal government\u2019s ECE program or the RBL program. \n24 Climate Change Assessment, and Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nselection of an independent verification agency will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval to ensure \nthat the selected agency has no conflict of interest with the municipal government or the SBE and \ndemonstrates  experience  and  capacity  to  conduct  scientifically  rigorous  evaluation  and/or \nresearch in the education and/or ECE sector. The qualification requirements and tasks of the \nverification  agency  are  in  the  program  implementation  document.25 The  PAP  includes  the \npreparation of an M&E manual, regular training of staff responsible for M&E, the conduct of \nstudies on out-of-kindergarten and left-behind children, and the collection of disaggregated data. \n \n33.  Fiduciary systems. The RBL program will use the financial management, procurement, \nand anticorruption systems for ECE in Shangrao. The program fiduciary systems assessment \nconfirmed that the SBE and the CEBs have adequate financial management systems and staff \ncapable  of  carrying  out  budgeting,  accounting,  financial  reporting,  payment,  and  cash \nmanagement tasks. There is room for improvement in internal controls, which are mainly geared \ntoward transactions and give insufficient attention to the efficiency and effectiveness of fund use. \nThe financial management capacity of the CEBs is low, especially in relation to timely preparation \nand submission of consistent financial statements. The program fiduciary systems assessment \nalso  confirmed  that  the  procurement  framework  in  place  is  aligned  with  the  principles  of \ncompetition, efficiency, economy, transparency, fairness, and equal opportunities, in line with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). Staff involved in procurement at \nthe SBE and the CEBs are generally experienced in the procurement of civil works (kindergarten \nand school buildings) and goods, while they are less experienced in procurement of consulting \nand nonconsulting services. The RBL program will exclude high-value procurement packages \nand contracts. The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited \nActivities in Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and the Shangrao Municipal Government.26 The PAP includes actions to strengthen \nthe fiduciary systems. \n \n34.  Safeguard systems. The RBL program is categorized B for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples safeguards. Outputs 1 and 2 will involve civil works on \npublic or collective lands or within existing kindergarten premises that may have some temporary \nand site-specific environmental impacts, and potential involuntary resettlement impacts. Outputs \n3 and 4 will not trigger environmental or involuntary resettlement impacts. Considering the nature \nand size of the kindergarten facilities to be included under the program, the environmental and \nsocial impacts are deemed insignificant.27 Any physical activities that may be classified category \nA for the ADB environment and involuntary resettlement safeguards are excluded from the RBL \nprogram. The ethnic minority population of Shangrao is well integrated into the majority Han \npopulation and has no specific issues with access to ECE, except for the She ethnic minority \ngroup for whom distance from home to kindergartens and the language may be barriers. While \nno adverse impacts on the She ethnic minority population are expected, the PAP includes actions \nto enhance the benefits for the She ethnic minority population. The program safeguard systems \nassessment (PSSA) confirmed that the programmatic, institutional, and contextual risks of the \nprogram will not be significant and that the municipal government, the SBE, and the CEBs have \nadequate capacity to manage the social and environmental risks associated with the RBL \nprogram activities. \n \n35.  The PSSA identified the following gaps: (i) lack of institutional arrangements and staffing \nfor environmental, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples safeguards; (ii) lack of \n \n25 Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2013. Piloting Results-Based Lending for Programs. Manila (Appendix 7). \n27 The area required for a kindergarten taken up under the program is not expected to be greater than 15 mu, with \nsmaller facilities requiring about 2 mu. A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n ", "12 \nscreening and categorization of subprojects; (iii) lack of identification of poor and vulnerable \ngroups during the land acquisition process; (iv) absence of documentation on consultation and \ninformation  disclosure  activities,  and  grievances  received;  and  (v)  inadequate  M&E.  The \nmunicipal  government  is  committed  to  implementing  the  PAP  actions,  which  include \n(i) establishment  of  screening  process  to  categorize  subprojects  into  the  three  safeguard \ncategories and exclude subprojects with category A impacts; (ii) conduct due diligence and \nassessment of impacts to address environment and social risks associated with the subprojects \nclassified category B; (iii) carry out training and capacity building of the staff engaged to manage \nthe implementation of safeguards; (iv) undertake monitoring of safeguards compliance, consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  requirements;  and  (v)  establish  a  formal \nmechanism for public consultation and a grievance redress mechanism. The PAP includes \nactions to address these gaps as well as actions to enhance benefits for the She ethnic minority \npopulation. The overall requirements of environment and social safeguard assessments have \nbeen defined in the environmental, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples safeguard \nsystems assessments.28 \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n36.  The RBL program risk was assessed to be moderate. The benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs.
