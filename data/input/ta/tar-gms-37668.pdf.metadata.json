The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) Program since its establishment in 1992 by ministers from the six participating countries: \nCambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China (Yunnan Province), People's Democratic Republic of \nLao (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  The GMS Program aims to promote \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  a  better  life  for  all  in  the  subregion  through  regional \ncooperation.    The  GMS  Program  has  initially  focused  on  infrastructure  development,  but \nattention  is  shifting  to  regional  approaches  to  addressing  social,  environmental,  and  trade \nissues. At the GMS Summit in November 2002, the six country leaders pledged to work together \nmore closely to reduce poverty and promote greater subregional integration.   \n \n2.    Regional  integration  is  expected  to  significantly  contribute  to  economic  growth  and \nimprove the livelihoods of the people living in the GMS. However, appropriate regional, national, \nand  local  strategies  are  required  to  ensure  that  the  poor  benefit  equitably  from  regional \nintegration. This is particularly important for communities that are in the front line of border \ninteractions and thus are likely to be directly impacted by regional integration.  Systematic \ninformation on regional dimensions of poverty is needed to inform regional, national, and local \npolicies and strategies. The technical assistance (TA)1 has been prepared to provide a more \ncomprehensive information base about cross-border livelihood interactions and poverty.  It is \nintended to consider how regional integration may be managed to ensure that benefits to the \npoor in the cross-border areas are maximized while addressing the negative impacts. The TA \nproposal was endorsed for funding at the strategy meeting of the Cooperation Fund in Support \nof the Formulation and Implementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies (NPRS) and \nthe Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund in July 2003.2 The TA will cover the cross-border \nareas  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  This  document  is  based  on \nconsultations held and understandings reached during a TA fact-finding mission to Cambodia, \nLao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam in October and November 2003.  This TA is included in the \nRegional Cooperation Strategy and Program 2004\u20132008. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Recent data indicates that the proportion of population below the national poverty line \nhas declined in all four countries: to approximately 36% in Cambodia,3 30% in Lao PDR,4 10% \nin Thailand,5 and 29% in Viet Nam.6  These figures compare to earlier estimates of 39% in \nCambodia in 1997,7 38.6% in Lao PDR in 1997,8 13% in Thailand in 1997,9 and 37% in Viet \nNam in 1998.10 Efforts to reduce poverty are grounded in national development and poverty \n                                                 \n1 The TA was initially titled Unmasking Cross-Border Poverty in the GMS. The TA first appeared in ADB Business \nOpportunities (Internet version) on 18 October 2003.   \n2 The proposal was initially endorsed for $600,000.  Taking into account the higher-than-expected estimated budget   \nrequirements to carry out the survey, the Government of Netherlands agreed in their e-mail of 14 January 2004 to \nincrease the budget to $750,000. \n3 Cambodia Human Development Report, Phnom Penh, published by UNDP. 2001.

", "2 \nreduction strategies and policies. These strategies and policies are based on aggregate data, \nwhich  provide  an  overall  understanding  of  poverty  at  the  national  and  provincial  levels. \nHowever, national poverty data are often not disaggregated at local levels.   While some \ninformation on regional poverty issues are available, it is not sufficient to formulate meaningful \nstrategies  and  policies.    The  information  gap  must  be  remedied  since  border  towns  are \nbecoming important hubs of economic activity and social interaction, with GMS integration \nresulting from infrastructure development, trade facilitation, and greater mobility of people.  \n \n4.  Systematic compilation of information on the issues related to regional dimensions of \npoverty will help to improve the national poverty reduction strategies, policies and strategies \nsupporting regional integration, and ADB supported initiatives.  The GMS Working Group on \nHuman Resources Development at its meeting in September 2002 identified regional poverty as \none of its priorities. The TA will contribute to a deeper understanding of the localized poverty in \nthe cross-border areas, and ways to reduce it. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n5.  The overall objective of the TA is to determine how increased connectivity between the \nGMS countries through infrastructure and communications development may be managed to \nensure that the economic and social status of the poor will be significantly enhanced. The \nimmediate objective of the TA is to assess the distribution of benefits and costs of cross-border \ninteractions among different groups, and identify  ways to maximize the benefits to the poor and \nminimize the negative impacts.  This initiative will form the basis for  (i) enhancing regional, \nnational, and local dialogue  on the issues and collaboration between the countries to manage \nthe process of regional economic integration, to benefit the poor as much as possible; (ii) \nstrengthening  the  networking  and  information  exchange  of  national  institutions  involved  in \ncollection, processing, and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data; and (iii) informing key \ndecision  makers,  stakeholders,  and  ADB  about  the  benefits  and  issues  of  cross-border \ninteractions. \n \n6.  Key outputs and deliverables will include  (i) quantitative data and qualitative information  \non  the  benefits  and  issues  related  to  cross-border  interactions;  (ii)  recommendations  to \nmaximize the benefits to the poor and minimize the negative impacts; (iii) enhanced national \ncapacity for collection, processing, and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data; (iv) better \nunderstanding of cross-border livelihood strategies of the poor as complementary inputs to the \nformulation or modification of NPRSs; and (v) recommendations for ADB operations in the \nprovinces covered under this initiative. An executive summary report containing a regional \ncomparison of the country findings and the country reports will be produced. The draft outline of \nthe expected final report is in Appendix 2. Other deliverables will include data sets on poverty \nissues in selected cross-border areas in the four countries, which should be made available to \nnational and external researchers for further analysis. \n \n7.  The TA will focus on cross-border interactions related to trade in goods and services, \nwhich  likely  has  the  highest  impact  on  local  living  standards;  employment;  other  income \ngenerating activities; community and resource interactions (i.e., agricultural activities, use of \nnatural resources, and social ties); social services; information exchange; and other issues   \nidentified by the participating countries.  The TA will consider men's and women's role as \ntraders and laborers, the impact of cross-border interactions on youths, and cultural impacts. \nThe TA is expected to assist NPRSs, where regional issues affect the effectiveness of national ", "    3 \nefforts to reduce poverty. It will not attempt to establish a new poverty line or to measure the \nincidence of poverty since other national initiatives measure and monitor poverty, such as the \nhousehold  expenditure  and  consumption  surveys.  Furthermore,  the  TA  will  have  limited \ngeographic coverage, and will build on other studies focused on specific regional issues such as \ntrafficking of people and illegal migrant workers.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, a comprehensive literature \nreview and stocktaking of existing data and information at the national and regional levels will be \nundertaken to identify the information gaps. A preliminary survey will also be undertaken to \nidentify the issues to be covered. Based on the identified gaps and preliminary survey, the \nscope of the study will be identified and the survey design will be discussed at the first regional \ninception workshop.  Existing studies and methodologies will also be reviewed, to determine \ntheir applicability at the first regional workshop. National research institutions that will undertake \nthe survey and analyses will be involved in the stocktaking exercise, which is a key step to \ndeveloping the quantitative and qualitative survey.    \n \n9.  The second phase will be data collection (qualitative and quantitative) and analysis. \nNational research institutions (NRIs) will work with national statistical offices (NSOs) in the \nquantitative  data  collection.  The  qualitative  data  collection  will  follow  the  quantitative  data \ncollection  and  will  include  focus  group  discussions  using  semi-structured  interviews  and \ninterviews of key informants, such as  local officials, community leaders, women\u2019s groups, and \nlaborers.  The  data  collection  and  analysis  will  incorporate  disaggregation  by  gender,  age, \nethnicity, and other factors, as appropriate.  The TA will draw on existing information and data \nas much as possible.  \n \n10.  Data analysis and reporting will be at the country and regional levels.  National research \ninstitutions are expected to prepare the country-level analyses, based on an agreed framework \nfor final report. Quantitative data will be collected and processed with the support of NSOs, \nwhich NRIs will complement with qualitative survey.  A short regional comparative report (the \nexecutive summary) will be prepared, translated, and disseminated at the national and regional \nlevels.  The report is expected to analyze key cross-border interactions related to social and \neconomic  infrastructure,  cross-border  economic  activities,  and  community  and  resource \ninteractions.    This  includes  review  of  repatriated  funds,  cross-border  transactions  on  local \nresource use, social and economic situations, community relations, and other impacts. \n \n11.  The TA activities will be undertaken in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam and \nwill focus on two of the three emerging economic corridors in the GMS\u2014east-west and south. \nThe third, the North-South Economic Corridor, will be considered at a later stage. A no-objection \nletter from each of the participating DMCs will be obtained before the TA is implemented in the \nsaid DMCs. Provinces proposed to be covered are (i) Nakhon Phanom (Thailand), Savannakhet \n(Lao  PDR),  and  Quang  Tri  (Viet  Nam)  for  the  East-West  Corridor;  and  (ii)  Prachin  Buri \n(Thailand), Banteay Meanchey and Svay Rieng (Cambodia) and Tay Ninh (Viet Nam) for the \nSouthern Corridor.  Data collection will mainly take place in the first stratum, which will be the \nborder  towns  of  Poipet  and  Bavet  (Cambodia);  Aranyaprathet  (Thailand);  Dansavanh  (Lao \nPDR);  and  Lao  Bao  and  Moc  Bai  (Viet  Nam).    The  border  towns  of  Savannakhet  and \nMukhdahan  along  the  east-west  corridor  will  not  be  covered,  since  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  is  undertaking  a  rapid  socioeconomic  assessment  there.  For \ncomparative purposes, second and third strata will include border districts and other districts in \nthe provinces.   ", "4 \n \n12.  A  regional  inception  workshop  will  be  organized  to  discuss  the  TA  framework,  \nmethodology, and technical aspects, such as  sample design  and survey questionnaire,  data \ncollection and analysis, and implications of the TA results for the NPRS in each country.  This \nwill be followed by in-country workshops at the national and provincial levels, to launch the \ninitiative in each country, review the preliminary results, and disseminate the final results. A \nsecond regional workshop will be organized to review the experience and discuss the draft \nreport.  The  TA  outputs  will  be  disseminated  at  appropriate  GMS  fora,  through  national \nworkshops, and on-line through the ADB web site.    \n \n13.  The GMS countries have a range of capacities and experience in poverty assessment, \nreduction, and monitoring. The TA is designed as a regional cooperative initiative to take \nadvantage of the different country experience and knowledge.  It is intended to promote cross-\ncountry learning and networking, especially between NSOs and NRIs in the GMS.  The TA will \nalso contribute to regional, national, and local level dialogue on poverty issues and its regional \ndimension, and  trigger a more formal and continuous cooperative monitoring system in these \nareas. \n \n14.  One of the main challenges in implementing the TA is to ensure consistency and quality \nof data collection and analysis. A regional coordinator will be engaged to play a key role in \naddressing this aspect.  Also,  the situation in and around the border towns is changing rapidly, \nand timing in data collection and analysis is extremely important to ensure that the information \ndoes not become obsolete.  Delays could occur at data collection and analysis stages in the \ncountries, given the different GMS country contexts and support of the NSOs and NRIs. Thus, \nthe TA implementation calendar will be reviewed at the first regional meeting to ensure that it is \nrealistic.  \n \n15.  Several regional initiatives launched by GMS countries promote economic development, \nwhich will benefit the poor, including the Economic Cooperation Strategy launched by Thailand \nto support initiatives in neighboring countries, and the Development Triangle Initiative where \nCambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  are  preparing  a  master  plan  to  coordinate  their \ndevelopment efforts. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is also preparing \nthe Southeast Asia Human Development Report. The TA is expected to complement these \nongoing  efforts  and  other  ADB-supported  projects,  such  as  the  Participatory  Poverty \nAssessment in the Tonle Sap (Cambodia); Making Markets Work for the Poor; and Rural, \nUrban, Subregional Linkages in the Mekong Region: A Holistic Approach to Development and \nPoverty Reduction, and Promoting NGO Support for Poverty Reduction in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion.11  To avoid duplication of efforts, the TA will monitor outputs of these other initiatives \nand coordinate activities as much as possible.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $820,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by the Cooperation Fund in Support of the Formulation and Implementation of \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategies, which will cover $750,000 equivalent.

ADB will administer the TA \nfunds.  The detailed cost estimates and the financing plan  are provided in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency.  ADB\u2019s Mekong Department will administer the TA, in \nclose cooperation with the ADB resident missions in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, and \nADB's  Extended  Mission  in  Thailand.  The  TA  implementation  period  is  scheduled  for  20 \nmonths, from May 2004 to December 2005.  National focal agencies for the TA are (i) the \nMinistry of Planning in Cambodia; (ii) the State Planning Committee in the Lao PDR; (iii) the \nNational Economic and Social Development Board in Thailand; and (iv) the Ministry of Planning \nin Viet Nam.  The TA will be implemented in cooperation with the NSOs for the quantitative data \ncollection. NRIs proposed to undertake the overall survey work are (i) Cambodia Development \nResource Institute in Cambodia; (ii) National Economic Research Institute in the Lao PDR; (iii) \nThai Development Research Institute in Thailand; and (iv) the Central Institute for Economic \nManagement in Viet Nam.  These national institutions are proposed based on their background, \nexperience, and interest in cross-border economic issues. The TA will benefit from working with \nthese institutions since they are already undertaking cross-border socioeconomic studies and \nthus are prepared to meet the challenges of the TA.  The institutions are already collecting and \nanalyzing  some  cross-border  issues,  and  thus  are  in  the  best  position  to  identify  gaps  in \ninformation and areas to focus under the TA. The institutions are involved in a Development \nAnalysis Network study on cross-border economies, which is focusing on specific commodities, \nsuch as garments.  Positive synergies between the two initiatives are expected.   \n \n18.  The TA implementation in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will be guided by a \nnational advisory forum in each country. The forum is expected to be constituted by existing \ncommittees  that  oversee  the  implementation  of  NPRSs.    In  Thailand,  the  GMS  National \nCoordination  Office,  governed  by  the  National  Sub-Committee  on  Neighboring  Country \nEconomic Cooperation, is expected to have a key role in steering the process. An ADB peer \nreview group will be formed to provide technical advice and inputs. The TA will require the \nservices  of  a  regional  coordinator  (8  person-months,  international)  responsible  for  overall \ncoordination  and  the  development  of  questionnaire  and  methodology;  a  household  survey \nexpert  to  provide  technical  support  in  sampling  and  data  processing  (4  person-months, \ninternational), a participatory assessment expert (3 person-months, international), and poverty \nadvisers  (1.5  months,  international),  as  individuals.    The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline of the terms of references \nare in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Cooperation Fund in Support of the Formulation and Implementation of \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategies for Reviewing the Poverty Impact of Regional Economic \nIntegration in the Greater Mekong Subregion, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \n       \nTo ensure that the  The design of national  Project reports.    \neconomic and social  and regional policies   \nstatus of the poor will  and interventions  National and regional \nbe significantly  targeted at reducing  policies and interventions \nenhanced by increased  poverty incorporates  revised or designed after \nconnectivity between  the outcome of the  the outcome of the TA \nthe Greater Mekong  technical assistance  activities have been \nSubregion (GMS)  (TA).   disseminated. \ncountries, with \ninfrastructure and \ncommunication network \ndevelopment and \nassociated regional \neconomic integration.   \n \nPurpose       \n       \nTo identify benefits and  Framework and  Quantitative and  Recommendations of the \nissues of cross-border  methodology, including  qualitative survey results.  study are accepted by the \ninteractions of different  simple survey    governments; to ensure \ngroups, and determine  questionnaire agreed  Summary report of the  country ownership, the TA \nways to maximize the  by all key stakeholders.  study printed in English  will work with national \nbenefits to the poor and    and local languages.  institutions, and detailed \nminimize the negative  Field research carried    scope and framework of the \nimpacts.  out based on agreed    TA activity will be validated \nframework,    at the inception workshop. \nmethodology, and time   \nframe.   \n   \nConclusions and   \nrecommendations of \nthe study. \nOutputs       \n       \nAnalytical report with   Draft report prepared in  Quarterly progress reports.
