I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Emergency Assistance for \nRecovery and Reconstruction (EARR). \n2.  The EARR will (i) rebuild damaged houses and improve essential public and community \ninfrastructure, and (ii) restore the country\u2019s immediate fiscal capacity to meet the sharp rise in \nincremental costs arising from the April and June 2010 conflicts. This will in turn help the Kyrgyz \nRepublic with reconciliation efforts and restoration of normalcy. \n \nII.  THE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In April 2010, the Kyrgyz Republic experienced significant political disturbance, resulting \nin  many  deaths  and  injuries,  substantial  property  damage,  and  a  change  in  government. \nCommunity violence erupted in June 2010 with even greater casualties, internal displacement, \nphysical damage, and losses. The urgent need for shelter before the onset of winter combined \nwith  food  security  and  livelihood-restoration  needs  increased  the  government\u2019s  burden. \nMoreover, energy infrastructure remains vulnerable to breakdown as a result of disrepair. While \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure  was  not  directly  damaged,  the  shortfall  in  fiscal \ntransfers to maintain dilapidated systems in the country\u2019s urban centers, especially in Osh and \nJalal-Abad cities, will result in significant deterioration of public health conditions. \n4.  Poverty incidence for 2009 was estimated at 31.7%. While the planned increase in social \nassistance spending (an increase of 115.7% in 2010 from 2009) is expected to lower poverty \nincidence, the fall in per capita income will push more households below the poverty line.1 The \nnumber of households headed by women will likely increase after the emergency. Gender gaps \nin wage and employment opportunities make these households more vulnerable to poverty, \nincreasing the dependence of women on social assistance to support their families. Moreover, \nwith  women  receiving  more  than  half  the  social  benefits,  providing  relatively  stable  social \nassistance coverage protects households headed by women from falling into extreme poverty.2 \n5.  Joint economic assessment. In May and July 2010, development partners conducted \na  joint  economic  assessment  (JEA)  to  determine  the  economic  and  social  impact  of  the \nconflicts, and identify needs and priorities.3 With impeded international trade, a drastic drop in \ntourist revenues, contraction in agricultural output, impaired business activities, and continued \nsocial tensions, gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to contract by 3.5% in 2010, below the \n5.5% growth forecast made at the start of the year. Significant nonresident deposit outflows \nimpaired the balance sheets of some banks, including the largest bank, Asia Universal Bank. \nThese outflows are thus increasing the risk of systemic banking problems. The JEA estimates \nthe aggregate financing requirement due to the emergency until the end of 2012 at $1 billion;  \n$671 million is needed for 2010 alone, of which $335 million is the budget financing gap. The \n                                                 \n1  Per capita output in 2010 is expected to fall from the pre-emergency projection of $943 to $826. \n2  Women comprise (i) 53% of the 351,000 beneficiaries of monthly benefits and (ii) 51% of 63,818 recipients of \nmonthly social benefits. National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2009. Men and Women of the \nKyrgyz Republic. Bishkek. \n3  The Asian Development Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank co-led the JEA mission  with \nparticipation of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Eurasian Development Bank, \nEuropean Union, International Finance Corporation, Swiss Cooperation Office, United Nations Development \nProgramme, and United States Agency for International Development. ", "2 \nJEA also identifies a significant funding requirement for reconstructing damaged houses in \nareas affected by the emergency. It likewise highlights the need to strengthen the delivery of \nbasic  infrastructure  services,  including  water  supply  and  sanitation  services,  in  local \ncommunities as a way of alleviating social tensions. \n6.  Fiscal  impact.  Lower  economic  growth,  the  rollback  of  the  energy  tariff  increase, \nremoval of the retail tax on energy payments, and restoration of value-added tax exemptions will \nlikely result in a revenue shortfall of $86.5 million, or 1.9% of GDP (Table 1). Expenditure \nreallocation is also needed to accommodate crisis-related spending of $268 million, which \nincludes  victim  compensation,  higher  security  spending,  social  infrastructure  projects, \ninfrastructure rehabilitation, and bank recapitalization. With these, the 2010 fiscal deficit will \nwiden to $615.8 million (13.7% of GDP) from the original estimate of $268.4 million (6% of \nGDP). 4  The  government  will  finance  $280.8  million  largely  from  net  external  financing  \n($123.2 million) and use of the Kyrgyz Republic Development Fund balances ($197.6 million),5 \nleaving  a  $335  million  financing  gap.  The  development  partners,  excluding  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), pledged fiscal support during their 27 July 2010 conference of only \n$207 million.6 \nTable 1: 2010 State Budget \n($ million) \nItem  Original Budget  JEA Estimates  Difference \nRevenue and Grants  1,343.3  1,256.7  (86.5) \nExpenditures and Net Lending  1,611.6  1,872.6  260.9 \nFiscal Balance  (268.4)  (615.8)  (347.5) \nFinancing  153.1  280.8  127.7 \nFinancing Gap  115.2  335.0  219.7 \nFiscal Support (excluding ADB)  207.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, JEA = joint economic assessment.  \nSources: Ministry of Finance, Joint Economic Assessment staff estimates. \n7.  The fiscal situation requires prudent fiscal management to balance reconstruction and \ndevelopment needs over the next 2 years with critical social expenditures for education, health, \nand  social  assistance.  Education  expenditures  include  wages,  textbook  purchases,  food, \nstipends, transportation, utility payments, and repair and maintenance of school facilities. State \ntransfers  to  local  governments  cover  teachers\u2019  salaries,  where  85%  are  women.7 Health \nexpenditures include health worker wages, medicines, food, transportation, and repair and \nmaintenance of health facilities. This includes support for maternal health care, especially in \nrural areas.8 In response to the emergency, the government provided one-time, lump-sum \ncompensation for victims of the April and June 2010 events. An increase in social assistance \nbeneficiaries  is  likely  as  disabled  victims  of  the  emergency  become  eligible  and  more \nhouseholds are likely to fall into extreme poverty.  \n                                                 \n4  Including the extrabudgetary funds, i.e., operations of the Social Fund and Kyrgyz Republic Development Fund, the \noverall budget deficit is $669.0 million (Som30.7 billion). \n5  The Kyrgyz Republic Development Fund is an extrabudgetary fund financed by proceeds of the $300 million loan \nfrom the Russian Federation in 2009. The fund balances comprise $191 million in the National Bank of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and $46 million in commercial banks. The fund reserves could be used for budgetary financing. \n6  Of which, the World Bank pledged $28 million, the International Monetary Fund $34 million, the European Union \n$15  million,  the  Eurasian  Development  Bank  (Anti-crisis  Fund)  $120  million,  and  the  Russian  Federation  \n$10 million. \n7  National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2009.

The maternal mortality ranges from 55 to 150 per 100,000 \nlive births according to National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic and United Nations data. \n ", "3 \n8.  Housing crisis and reconciliation needs. Community violence in June 2010 led to \nnumerous casualties and property damage in Osh and  Jalal-Abad. Approximately 375,000 \npeople  were  internally  displaced.  The  Rapid  Joint  Shelter  Assessment,9 conducted  by  the \nShelter  Cluster  partners  (led  by  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees \n(UNHCR)),10 indicates that about 1,900 houses were damaged, of which about 1,700 were \neither severely damaged or completely destroyed.11 This affected about 13,500 people. The \nassessment indicates that (i) 36% of households had no access to water supply and sanitation \nservices after the emergency; (ii) 41% of households lost ownership documents during the \nemergency; and (iii) more than 95% of those who were internally displaced preferred to return \nand rebuild their own homes rather than be resettled to a new location. \n9.  In consultation with the government, the Shelter Cluster partners adopted a shelter \nstrategy with a budget of $26 million. This was to provide an immediate response to the need for \nshelter and included (i) immediate emergency assistance, (ii) emergency transitional shelter \nsupport and \u201cwinterization\u201d, and (iii) support for displaced persons living with host families. The \ngovernment was to follow up on this immediate response with the provision of permanent \nhousing.  \n10.  Of the 1,900 damaged houses, UNHCR is coordinating the reconstruction of 1,350 \nseverely  damaged  houses,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  is \nreconstructing 200 houses, and the International Committee of the Red Cross is reconstructing \n350 houses. Under these efforts, families are provided with basic construction materials and \nengaged in reconstruction through a self-help program with assistance of construction teams. \nUNHCR is also assisting in restoration of the property title and housing documentation lost or \ndamaged during the emergency. The United Nation Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) is providing \nwater, sanitation, and hygiene support during the early recovery phase. \n11.  Based on the shelter strategy, severely damaged houses were eligible for 100 square \nmeters  (m2)  of  built-up  area.  The  Shelter  Cluster  partners  were  to  reconstruct  transitional \nshelters of up to 50 m2 for each damaged house to allow displaced persons to resettle at their \nproperties before the onset of winter. The government planned to construct the remaining 50 m2 \nof built-up area through their own funds. The transitional shelter is, in reality, a permanent \nstructure, which can be extended for permanent housing. Due to higher input prices, the Shelter \nCluster partners could only provide 28 m2 of built-up area comprising two rooms.  \n12.  Public infrastructure damage. The impact on public infrastructure comprises direct \nstructural damage and risks of further dilapidation due to lack of fiscal resources to operate and \nmaintain all infrastructure assets. If left unaddressed, both will result in infrastructure crises in \nthe medium-term. The needs include the following: \n(i)  The energy sector requires financing of $180 million to address energy efficiency \nimprovements; and rehabilitation and reconstruction of district heating, electricity, \nand gas systems. Also, maintenance of district heating facilities, operated by the \nstate-owned KyrgyzZhilKommunSoyuz Enterprise, is likely to suffer due to the \nreversal of energy tariffs; the adverse impact will only be felt during winter. The \nWorld Bank will repair damaged power lines and provide heating fuel. \n                                                 \n9  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 2010.

An average house contains two \nfamilies with an average family size of 7.5 persons. \n ", "4 \n(ii)  Since the emergency, many cities and small towns have been unable to generate \nsufficient  operating  revenues  to  cover  their  wage  bills,  thereby,  putting \nmaintenance  of  local  infrastructure  (i.e.,  local  roads,  and  water  supply  and \nsanitation) at risk.  \n(iii)  Direct damage to transport infrastructure is confined to municipal roads in Osh \nand public transport systems in Osh and Bishkek, amounting to $20 million. Cuts \nin the road repair budget need to be avoided to avert the consequences of \ndeferred maintenance. Routine road works will provide temporary jobs to counter \nincome losses during crises. \n(iv)  Public health has been largely affected by the lack of adequate resources to \nmaintain water supply and sanitation systems. City governments are unable to \nsubsidize  revenue  shortfalls  of  the  utilities.  Significant  capital  outlays  are \nimmediately  required  to  rehabilitate  the  systems  and  continue  services  to \nmitigate potential stability risks.  \n(v)  About 30 public buildings and 700 commercial establishments were damaged \nwith a loss of $130 million due to the emergency. \n13.  Proposed ADB assistance. The EARR is in response to the government's call for \nassistance to mitigate the adverse effects of the April and June 2010 conflicts. It is based on \nADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Policy  (DEAP),12 which  offers  an  effective  and  suitable \nframework to promptly respond to emergency needs, and provides rapid funding to help rebuild \nhigh priority assets and restore economic, social, and governance activities after emergencies.13  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the EARR is economic recovery and social reconciliation. The EARR\u2019s \noutcome is maintenance of essential public expenditures and rebuilding of critical social and \npublic infrastructure assets in areas affected by the community violence. \nC.  Outputs \n1.  Component 1: Fiscal Support \n15.  The first component will ensure (i) uninterrupted service delivery by health and education \ninstitutions managed by the central and local governments, (ii) continued provision of social \nsafety nets to vulnerable groups,14 and (iii) maintenance of roads and urban services. This \nentails fiscal support for critical recurrent social and infrastructure maintenance expenditures. It \nwill act as a liquidity cushion against revenue shocks and, combined with the government's own \nresources,  prevent  further  disruption  of  public  services.  To  achieve  these,  certain  priority \nrecurrent public expenditures in the proposed revised Republican budget for 2010 will need to \nbe protected (Table 2).15 \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. The government requested emergency assistance \nfrom ADB in July 2010. \n13  A proposed urban services project for Bishkek and Osh planned for 2011 has been brought forward to 2010 to help \nwith the reconstruction process. In addition to the Emergency Assistance for Recovery and Reconstruction Project, \nADB assistance in 2010 to the Kyrgyz Republic includes the Power Sector Improvement Project ($44.8 million) and \nSupplementary  Financing  for  the  CAREC  Regional  Road  Corridor  Improvement  Project  (Supplementary;  \n$23 million). \n14  Support for the social assistance program will sustain the benefits under the reformed system and help vulnerable \nbeneficiaries, especially women. \n15  The government has approved a proposed revised Republican budget for 2010, which will be submitted for \nparliamentary approval as required by the national budget law. \n ", "5 \nTable 2: Critical Public Expenditures in the Proposed Revised 2010 Republican Budget \n(Som million) \nRecurrent Expenditure Item  Amount\n1.

Reconstruction of damaged houses is a prerequisite to achieving social reconciliation. \nBuilding on the achievements of the shelter strategy, the government has asked ADB to help \nwith the reconstruction of damaged houses. This component will assist the government in \nproviding permanent houses to affected families by expanding the two-room (28 m2) transitional \nshelter for approximately 1,700 severely damaged or completely destroyed houses by 72 m2 at \nan estimated cost of $246 per m2 of built-up area. House design will be based on the individual \nhousehold need as estimated by the UNHCR shelter database. All reconstructed houses will \nhave water supply and sanitation services, electricity and heating facilities. Where sewerage \nsystems do not exist, septic tanks or other safe sanitation systems will be provided.  \n17.  To ensure a smooth transition from the early recovery phase of the shelter strategy, this \ncomponent will make use of the UNHCR implementing partners. By doing this, the EARR will \nbenefit from the familiarity of the UNHCR implementing partners with the affected families as \nwell as technical requirements for reconstruction. This component will be coordinated with \nUNHCR to ensure a smooth transition from the early recovery phase.  \n18.  The EARR will continue to engage those affected families in the reconstruction of their \nhouses through a self-help program. The EARR consultants will conduct technical, financial, \nand social audits to monitor construction and ensure that construction quality is maintained. \n3.  Component 3: Community Infrastructure and Water Supply and Sanitation \n(WSS) Improvement \n19.  The  EARR  will  improve  community  infrastructure  as  a  means  of  achieving  social \nreconciliation. Community consultations by the government and ADB will determine critical \ncommunity infrastructure, which needs improvement. This would include repair and renovation \nof community centers, schools, and health clinics. Such infrastructure improvement is seen as a \nkey factor in improving social cohesion in the affected region. \n20.  Improving public health in the region will also accelerate the reconciliation process. \nProvision of clean and reliable water is the main urban basic service requirement in the cities of \nOsh  and  Jalal-Abad.  The  EARR  will  rehabilitate  water  supply  intake  works  and  treatment \nsystems, and replace the water transmission system to supply continuous and reliable water to \napproximately 335,000 residents in both cities. It will develop detailed designs for long-term \nWSS improvement in the two cities to be financed through normal lending after the emergency \nphase. The proposed improvements will complement efforts of a proposed European Bank for \n ", "6 \nReconstruction and Development and Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs project for \nboth cities addressing water and sewerage network deficiencies.16  \n21.  With the urgency for reconstruction and reconciliation, implementation assistance will \nsupport  project  management,  procurement,  technical  matters,  safeguards  design  and \nimplementation, capacity building, information dissemination, and equipment. \nD.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR32.057 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the EARR. The loan will have an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1% per annum; a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 \nyears; repayment of principal at 2% per annum for the first 10 years after the grace period and \n4% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft financing \nagreement. The government has also requested a grant not exceeding $51.5 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the  EARR.  Counterpart  funds  generated  from \nSDR10.906 million of loan proceeds and $23.5 million of the grant proceeds will be used to \nfinance critical public expenditures under component 1 (as indicated in Table 2). Grant proceeds \nof $28 million will be used for component 2, and loan proceeds of SDR21.151 million will be \nused for component 3 and SDRD safeguard unit costs. The financing plan is in Table 4. ADB\u2019s \nresources will come from the normal annual allocations for the Kyrgyz Republic for 2010\u20132011  \n($77 million) and an allocation from Asian Development Fund savings ($23 million).  \nTable 4: Financing Plan \nAmount Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  100.0    90.91 \n    ADF Grant  51.5    46.82 \n    ADF Loan  48.5    44.09 \nGovernment  10.0    9.09 \n  Total   110.0 100.00 \nADF = Asian Development Fund.               . \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                 \n16  They plan to provide approximately $17 million equivalent to Osh and Jalal-Abad cities. \n ", "7 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  The  DEAP  contemplates  the  inclusion  of  quick-disbursing  components  to  finance \nimports  considered  necessary  for  effective  recovery  but  also  emphasizes  that  such  quick-\ndisbursing components are not program loans. Component 1 provides fiscal support for critical \npublic  expenditures  and  related  counterpart  funds  are  earmarked  for  such  local  currency \nexpenditures (i.e., based on a positive list of eligible expenditures incurred from 1 October 2010 \nto 31 December 2010). Component 2 will support reconstruction of damaged houses and \nfinance local currency expenditures for the costs of construction materials and labor (in addition \nto  imports)  as  most  of  the  basic  construction  materials  and  labor  will  be  sourced  locally. \nConsequently,  the  DEAP  requirement  for  imports  to  be  financed  under  quick-disbursing \ncomponents  is  not  applicable  for  components  1  and  2.

Given the urgent EARR needs, procurement of goods, services, and works will be \ncarried out in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient procedures permitted under \nthe  DEAP  and  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nRelaxation  of  international  competitive  bidding  requirements  for  works  and  goods  with  an \nabbreviated bidding and evaluation period will expedite contract awards under the EARR (as \ndetailed in the project administration manual). All consultants will be recruited according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n26.  After the conflicts, the immediate task is to stop further economic slippage. By providing \nadditional liquidity protection against revenue shortfalls, fiscal support will help the government \nimplement  its  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus,  fueling  economic  growth  to  make  economic \nactivities more viable. Given the total destruction in many areas, any support is likely to bring \nsignificant  incremental  benefits  to  the  affected  population.  Support  for  the  restoration  of \ndamaged houses will have beneficial economic and social outcomes. By providing essential \npublic services and rebuilding infrastructure, the EARR\u2019s investment component will have direct \nand  indirect  impacts  on  economic  revival.  Financial  and  economic  assessment  will  be \nconducted for investments made under component 3, and only those assessed to be financial \nand economically viable will be undertaken. \nB.  Governance \n27.  The 2009 public expenditure and financial accountability assessment found that the \neffectiveness of the public financial management systems varied across stages. It found budget \nclassification, preparation, and execution reporting satisfactory. However, internal audits are not \nin line with international standards and the scope of external audit is not comprehensive. To \nmitigate the weakness in the government audit system, the EARR will require the government to \nestablish a special account in the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic for grant and loan \nproceeds for component 1. ADB will regularly monitor this account, and public expenditures \nfinanced out of the som conversion of the loan and grant proceeds. The government will also \nsubmit sections of the 2010 budget execution report pertaining to the eligible expenditures \nunder component 1. These requirements will be reflected in the financing agreement. \n28.  SDRD  currently  comprises  administrative  and  field  staff  appointed  to  oversee  the \nreconciliation  process.  It  has  limited  knowledge  of  ADB  procurement  procedures.  Hence, \nprocurement will be conducted with assistance of the project management consultant (firm). It \nwill also create a safeguards unit to ensure all activities are compliant with EARR environmental \nand social safeguard requirements. \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  including  MOF  and  SDRD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any allegedly corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nthe EARR. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are \nincluded in the loan and grant regulations and the bidding documents. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the EARR will include provisions specifying the right of ADB \nto audit and examine the records and accounts of the MOF and SDRD and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the EARR. Specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n ", "9 \nC.  Poverty and Social \n30.  By supporting critical social expenditures and rebuilding physical assets, the EARR will \nmitigate the short- and medium-term poverty and social impact of the emergency. Protecting \nsocial assistance expenditures will lessen the risk of reversal in the social assistance reforms. It \nwill also support uninterrupted delivery of education and health services. This will address the \npossible deterioration of social services, which could occur as a result of the emergency and \nwould  especially  burden  the  most  vulnerable  population  groups  such  as  poor  households \nheaded by women.  \nD.  Safeguards \n31.  The EARR is classified as category C for (i) involuntary resettlement; and (ii) indigenous \npeoples.  The  EARR  will  not  finance  activities  that  require  land  acquisition,  involuntary \nresettlement and/or impact on indigenous peoples, or are associated with such activities.  \n32.  With respect to indigenous peoples, the classification reflects the fact that ethnic groups \nin the Kyrgyz Republic do not fit the indigenous people definition under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). However, when supporting critical social expenditures and housing, as well \nas reconciliation efforts benefiting people affected by the emergency, the EARR will exercise \nextensive due diligence to ensure that these benefits are equitable among all affected groups. \nStakeholder consultations involving all affected families and community representatives will be \nan integral part of the EARR. Consultations will be well documented and reported to ADB for \nreview and, if required, specific actions and/or programs for identified vulnerable groups might \nbe prepared and integrated into the EARR\u2019s activities. The social development specialist from \nthe  project  management  consultant  (firm)  will  be  involved  in  preparing,  implementing,  and \nmonitoring social programs for vulnerable groups. \n33.  The  EARR  is  classified  as  B  for  environmental  impacts.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations  and  environmental  management  plans  will  be  prepared  based  on  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  which  is  based  on  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of the government and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  The benefits of the EARR, both short- and medium-term, are contingent on mitigating \npotential risks. Measures to mitigate different types of risks are incorporated in the EARR\u2019s \ndesign. One important assumption is that the government is able to reestablish political stability. \nADB will work closely with the government and other JEA partners to monitor results and track \naid to the government. Overall, the EARR\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6.  \nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nRenewed community tension  The EARR\u2019s fiscal support component helps maintain critical public \nexpenditures that benefit the entire population. The housing component is \nbased on technical assessment of damaged houses in affected areas.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n35.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the EARR will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and financing documents.  \n36.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the EARR, which are set \nforth in the financing agreement. \n37.  No withdrawal will be made (i) under component 1 until the revised government budget \nfor financial year 2010 has been approved for submission to the Parliament; and (ii) under \ncomponent 2 until an agreement for implementation of component 2, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, has been entered into between the government and the implementing \npartners, except for specified retroactively financed activities. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve  \n(i)  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR32,057,000  to  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic for the Emergency Assistance for Recovery and Reconstruction from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum;  for  a  term  of  40  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years;  with \nrepayment of principal at 2% per annum for the first 10 years after the grace \nperiod and 4% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft financing agreement \npresented to the Board; \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $51,500,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  for  the  Emergency  Assistance  for  Recovery  and \nReconstruction, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft financing agreement presented to the Board; and  \n(iii)  waiver of the requirement that quick-disbursing components finance a list of \nimports as discussed more fully in paragraph 24 of this report. \n \nC.
