In  September  2000,  137  heads  of  state  and  government  adopted  the  Millennium \nDeclaration  that  mainstreams  a  set  of  development  goals,  known  as  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, into the global agenda.1 The first such goal is to eradicate extreme poverty \nand hunger. Among the Millennium Development Goals is the need to build a global partnership \nfor development (Goal 8) through (i) addressing the special needs of small island developing \nstates  (target  13);  and  (ii)  making  available  the  benefits  of  new  technologies,  especially \ninformation and communications (target 18).  \n \n2.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  committed  to  reducing  poverty.  ADB  also \nsupports the main principle of universal access of the Okinawa Charter2 that everyone should \nbe enabled to participate in, and no one should be excluded from, the benefits of information \nand communication technology (ICT).  \n \n3.  ADB's strategy for the Pacific3 emphasizes the importance of regional cooperation to \ncollectively reap the benefits of economies of scale, and states that ADB will work with its \nPacific developing member countries (PDMCs) to utilize ICT to overcome constraints associated \nwith smallness and isolation, and to realize potential gains offered by links to global markets. \nThe PDMC leaders are aware of the critical importance of ICT and regional cooperation and, \naccording  to  a  statement  issued  in  1999,4  envisages  \u201ca  regional  community  in  which  the \nprocesses of work, commerce, learning, social interaction, and government are facilitated and \nenhanced by ICT, enabling all citizens to take part in opportunities brought by the global \ninformation economy.\u201d \n \n4.  This objective was reconfirmed during an ADB-financed workshop on ICT readiness in \nthe Pacific held in 2002.5 This regional technical assistance (TA) seeks to assist the PDMCs in \nfostering  cooperation  and  enhancing  basic  social  service  delivery  to  remote  communities \nthrough the use of ICT while making governments more efficient, effective, accountable, and \ntransparent.6 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The PDMCs are vulnerable to natural disasters, most have few resources, almost all are \nremote, and many do not have enough population to benefit from economies of scale.7 Poverty \nin the Pacific is not about lack of food; it is mainly the lack of access to basic services such as \nhealth and education that rely a great deal on information. In an address in early 2003, the \nPresident of ADB cited access to information as the \u201cmost critical factor in breaking the cycle of \npoverty.\u201d8 \n \n                                                 \n1  United Nations. 2000.

Poverty: Is It an Issue in the Pacific? Manila. \n8  World Summit of the Information Society 2003. Keynote address by Tadao Chino, President of ADB. Tokyo, Japan, \nJanuary 2003. ", "2 \n6.  ADB is helping the PDMCs to identify the extent and nature of poverty in the Pacific.9 \nThe general perception is that poverty is increasing and that the limited capacity of the public \nadministrations to provide basic social services and social protection are perceived by the poor \nthemselves as the main causes of poverty and hardship.  \n \n7.  Public administration is information intensive, and the geography of the Pacific makes \ncommunication difficult and expensive. ICT is becoming a cheap and effective way to collect, \nstore, retrieve, and disseminate information. In particular, electronic means can be used by \ngovernments to realize large productivity and gains in the provision of services, especially social \nservices to remote communities. E-government is a term that describes the use of ICT to \npromote more efficient and cost-effective government, facilitate more convenient government \nservices,  allow  greater  public  access  to  information,  ease  social  inclusion,  and  make \ngovernment policies and activities more transparent and accountable. ICT can increase the \nspeed,  volume,  quality,  and  transparency  of  transactions  through  faster  access  to,  and \ndistribution  of,  information.  ICT  also  makes  possible  entirely  new  procedures,  forms  of \ntransactions, interaction among people, information, and communications that were previously \nimpossible because of high cost or unmanageability.  \n \n8.  The needs, challenges, and opportunities that ICT offers to improve government service \ndelivery in the Pacific were discussed during the ADB workshop on ICT in the Pacific10 among \nrepresentatives of the PDMCs, the aid community, and other stakeholders, including private \nsector. It was agreed that e-government practices may be particularly beneficial in the PDMCs, \ngiven their highly dispersed geography, because ICT helps overcome the effects of distance \nand time.  \n \n9.  The main challenge for the PDMC governments is to deliver basic social services in \nremote locations. Here ICT can play a pivotal role. ICT costs are decreasing and performances \nare increasing dramatically. Furthermore, ICT can be introduced and used according to scale, \ni.e., it can be matched to the ability of its users to pay. For instance, the global system for \nmobile communication facility can be used for short message service by low-income customers, \nvoice communication by middle-income, and Internet browsing by those with high incomes. \n \n10.  External assistance to ICT for development in the PDMCs has come from a  large \nnumber of donors, institutions, and regional organizations. Among the bilateral donors active in \nthis arena are Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and United States. Among the multilateral and \nregional organizations are the Forum Secretariat, the International Telecommunication Union, \nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the South Pacific Applied Geoscience \nCommission (SOPAC), and the World Health Organization. In particular, at the regional level, \nthe Forum Secretariat, International Telecommunication Union, and UNDP are assisting the \nPDMCs in improving the policy and regulatory framework. The governments of Australia, Japan, \nNew Zealand, United States are assisting in the regional provision of telehealth11 and distance \nlearning. The Pacific Disaster Center, SOPAC, and the South Pacific Regional Environmental \nProgramme are assisting the region in disaster prevention and mitigation. \n \n11.  ADB is assisting the PDMC governments with several lending and non-lending products \nto improve the provision of basic social services to remote areas. In particular, it is assisting the \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2001.

More  specifically,  ADB  is  assisting  PDMCs  with  a  regional  ICT  project  to  facilitate \nregional cooperation12 and in preparing a regional project with the University of the South Pacific \nfor  extending  the  reach  of  distance  learning  in  the  Pacific.  It  is  also  assisting  individual \ngovernments in increasing the government\u2019s service delivery, accountability, and transparency. \nFor example, in Timor Leste, ADB is helping to rehabilitate the telecommunications sector.13 In \nPapua New Guinea, ADB is assisting in developing the financial management system14 and the \nintegrated human resources management system.15 In the Marshall Islands, ADB is helping the \nMinistry of Health and Environment improve its health management information system.16 In the \nFiji Islands, ADB is assisting the Native Lands Trust Board in establishing land boundaries \nthrough global positioning system devices.17 In the Federated States of Micronesia, ADB is \nhelping to put national and state legislation on the world wide web.18 \n \n13.  An  ADB-financed  regional  TA  on  ICT  assessment  in  the  Pacific19  identified  and \ndiscussed several possible e-government assistance projects at the national level20 as well as \nthe regional level.21 It also emphasized the opportunity to plan and implement a subregional e-\ngovernment project, with easy maintenance, scalability, and replicability in other PDMCs, which \nwould assist in addressing poverty and improving the quality of life in the PDMCs through \nenhanced basic social service delivery, statistics, citizen empowerment, disaster mitigation, and \ngovernance. This would be the first subregional loan to the Pacific from a development bank, \nand as such, its importance cannot be overstated. ICT is mature and available off the shelf,22 \nand ADB is the ideal position to assist the PDMC governments in easing poverty and hardship \nwhile enhancing service delivery, social inclusion, regional cooperation, and governance.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The main objective of the assistance is to contribute to economic growth and poverty \nreduction in remote and poor communities in the Pacific while fostering regional cooperation \nand governance. The objective of the TA is to assist PDMCs in assessing their e-government \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2001.

", "4 \ndemand and implementation capacity, mainly with reference to basic social service delivery to \nremote and disadvantaged communities. The TA will also identify and formulate a regional pro-\npoor e-government project for providing basic service delivery to remote communities, including \na feasibility study suitable for financing by ADB or other external funding agencies, and assess \nits long-term sustainability.  \n \n15.  The TA will achieve the following outputs in two selected PDMCs: (i) assessment of pro-\npoor  e-government  service  delivery  demand  and  implementation  capacity;  (ii)  enhanced \nawareness  of  its  possible  benefits;  (iii)  review  of  best  practices  and  lessons  learned;  (iv) \npreparation  of  a  feasibility  study  for  a  subregional  project  for  external  financing;  (v) \nrecommendations for making the project sustainable and beneficial to the poor, and (vi) based \non outcomes and progress made in the two selected PDMCs, dissemination of the lessons \nlearned from the TA to other PDMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  Implementation  of  the  assistance  will  occur  in  two  phases:  (i)  assessment  of \ndemand/supply and implementation capacity of pro-poor e-government social service delivery in \nremote areas; and (ii) development of a subregional project suitable for financing by ADB or \nother external funding agencies and assessment of its long-term sustainability. \n \n17.  Based on the priorities identified in the poverty reduction consultation workshops, Phase \n1 will include (i) raising awareness of the possible benefits of pro-poor e-government social \nservice  delivery  in  remote  areas;  (ii)  an  assessment  of  implementation  capacity,  including \navailable human resources; (iii) a review of best practices and lessons learned in the Pacific \nislands and other regions; (iv) in close consultation with stakeholders, formulation of a pro-poor \nsubregional e-government project for providing basic service delivery to remote communities; \nand (v) identification of two PDMCs able and willing to invest resources to implement the \nproject. \n \n18.  Based on the results of Phase 1, Phase 2 will develop a subregional project suitable for \nexternal financing. Phase 2 will (i) prepare a feasibility-level design for the project, including \nscope,  components,  cost  estimates,  implementation  arrangements,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance procedures; (ii) undertake a detailed socioeconomic survey, poverty analysis, \nenvironmental examination (as required), and financial and economic evaluation of the project; \n(iii) assess the implementation capacity and future operation and maintenance capacity; (iv) \npropose  institutional  improvement  to  ensure  efficient  operation  and  maintenance  and \nimplementation of the project, including possible private sector participation; and (v) recommend \nthe adoption of sustainable measures to ensure that the poor can benefit from the project. \n \n19.  To ensure full country commitment and TA success, during inception and prior to the \ncommencement of Phase 2, the two selected PDMC governments will prepare and issue an ICT \ndevelopment  policy  letter.  This  document  will  demonstrate  the  relevant  governments\u2019 \ncommitment to taking ownership of the TA and its objective and purposes as well as to provide \ncounterpart staff and other inputs in kind, as required. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $390,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $290,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe governments involved will provide the balance of $100,000 equivalent. Details of the TA ", "    5 \ncosts are shown in Appendix 2.  The governments involved will be apprised that the provision of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ADB's Pacific Department will be the Executing Agency. In the two PDMCs selected, the \nministry of finance (or its equivalent) will act as implementing agency for the TA. The TA will \nrequire approximately 6 person-months of an ICT expert international consultant (team leader) \nover 13 months, including around 1.5 person-months over 3 months for the Phase 1. The \nconsultant will be selected on an individual basis. The TA will also require 3 person-months for \nshort-term  international  consultancies,  including  social  and  economic  analysis  expertise.  In \naddition, domestic consultants from the Philippines and PDMCs will be engaged to work at ADB \nheadquarters and in the PDMCs for a total of 5 person-months to gather and organize data and \ninformation, help manage the TA, and facilitate stakeholders\u2019 awareness and participation.  \n \n22.  The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The team leader will be in charge of coordinating inputs and outputs of individual \nteam members. In the course of preparing the studies, consultants will visit the PDMCs as \nappropriate. The terms of reference for consulting services are detailed in Appendix 3. \n \n23.  The consultants will prepare an inception report within three weeks of the start of the \nservices. The interim report, including information on the progress of the study, will be submitted \nwithin 3 months after the commencement of the consulting services. The draft final report, \ncontaining the findings and recommendations of the study, will be provided 1 month before the \nend of the consulting services for comments by ADB and the PDMC governments concerned. \nAn integrated final report, incorporating the comments of the governments and ADB, will be \nprepared within a month after receipt of comments. The TA is expected to commence in \nNovember 2003 and be completed in December 2004. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $290,000 on a grant basis for \nPreparing a Pro-Poor Subregional E-Government Project for Providing Basic Service Delivery to \nRemote Communities in the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \n       \nContribute to economic  By November 2015  \u2022 Census data/household    \ngrowth and poverty       income and expenditure   \nreduction through  Reduced incidence of  data \nimproved access to  rural poverty by 50% in  \u2022 Poverty assessments \nbasic services.  participating countries.  \u2022 Asian Development Bank \n  (ADB) project  \nMake available the     performance audit \nbenefits of new     report \ntechnologies, especially \ninformation and \ncommunication \ntechnology (ICT). \nObjective       \n       \nFoster regional  By November 2010  Regional Reports and  Macroeconomic situation in \ncooperation and    Statistics  the selected PDMCs \nenhance the delivery of  At least another 50    remains conducive to \nbasic services to  remote communities  Government statistics and  economic growth and \nremote communities  have reliable and  budget  poverty reduction \nwhile making  affordable access to     \ngovernment(s) more  basic social services  ADB project completion  Governments committed and \nefficient, effective,  through ICT.  report of ensuing loan  willing/able to cooperate \naccountable and     \ntransparent.
