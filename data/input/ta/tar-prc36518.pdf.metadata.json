Investments in education and related applications of distance education are an essential \npart of the \u201cgo west\u201d strategy and Government efforts to reduce poverty in the Western Region \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) believes that \neducation is essential to provide people with the tools to escape poverty.1 During the PRC \ncountry programming mission in June 2002, the Government requested ways to use distance \neducation  and  an  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  distance  education  by \nidentifying information and communication technology (ICT) applications in education more \neffectively. The TA Fact Finding Mission fielded from 28 August to 6 September 2002 reached \nan  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  estimated  cost,  and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA.2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Status of Basic Education. Basic education in the PRC comprises primary education, \ngenerally of 6 years in duration (some poor localities maintain a 5 year system), and secondary \neducation, consisting of a general education track of 3 years of lower and 3 years of upper \nsecondary schooling, and a vocational track that accounts for roughly half of upper secondary \nenrollments. Compulsory education includes the primary and lower secondary level (grades 1\u2013\n9).  The Compulsory Education Law, enacted in 1986, stipulates that all children should receive \n9 years of education, although in light of regional inequalities, it was recognized in the 1990s \nthat achieving 9 years of compulsory education would have to be done in phases.  The PRC \nhas made great progress in achieving near universal 9 year education in the coastal and more \nindustrialized eastern areas, but still faces the daunting task of universalizing lower secondary \n(and in many poor counties, even 6 years of primary) schooling in the poorer Western Region.3  \n \n3.  Today, the PRC has the largest primary and lower secondary education system in the \nworld. The PRC has been more successful in achieving universal compulsory education (UCE) \nthan  other  countries  at  a  similar  level  of  economic  development.  There  are  over  580,000 \nprimary schools with about 135 million students and almost 6 million teachers, and about 64,400 \nlower secondary schools with over 58 million students and 3 million teachers. The national \nachievements are generally impressive \u2014 increased enrollment, reduced gender gaps, reduced \ndrop-out rates, and increased proportion of qualified and trained teachers. However, these mask \ndisparities between the eastern and coastal regions and the Western Region, and between rural \nand urban regions within the Western Region. Although official statistics indicate that 99.1% of \nchildren age 6-11 are enrolled in schools, sizeable numbers of children remain unable to attend \nprimary schools or to complete the primary cycle, mostly in poor pockets of the Western Region. \nLarger numbers fail to enter and complete lower secondary education. Thus, a major challenge \nis to ensure access to quality UCE, with a particular focus on minorities and girls in the remote \nregions of the Western Region. \n \n                                                 \n1  One recent study of rural poverty in the PRC found that public investment in education (compared to other \ninvestments) is associated with the highest level of poverty reduction in the Western Region. International Food \nPolicy Research Institute, 2002. Growth, Inequality, and Poverty in Rural China: The Role of Public Investments. \nWashington, DC. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet version) 30 September 2002. \n3  The Western Region consists of 12 province-level administrative entities: Chongqing Municipality, 6 provinces \n(Gansu,  Guizhou,  Qinghai,  Shaanxi,  Sichuan,  and  Yunnan),  and  5  autonomous  regions  (Guangxi  Zhuang \nAutonomous Region (AR), Inner Mongolia AR, Ningxia Hui AR, Tibet AR, and Xinjiang Uygur AR).   ", "2   \n4.  Many teachers in the compulsory system lack the qualification and training required to \nmeet  the  ongoing  curriculum  reform  and  the  Government\u2019s  targets  for  teacher  upgrading. \nParticularly in the Western Region, many teachers need to upgrade their credentials to meet \nofficially required qualification levels and many more require periodic support to update their \nskills and approaches. While the decentralization policy has led to increased investments in \nbetter-off areas of the PRC, it has put tremendous pressures on the poor regions where local \nresources are limited and the education indicators (teachers; instructional materials; physical \ninputs; and enrollment, attendance, drop-out and completion rates) lag behind the national \naverage. The quality of basic education and poverty level of households are two major factors \nassociated with student dropouts in basic education. Both these factors are intertwined and \nreinforce the need to improve education inputs in poorer areas. \n \n5.  Progress is needed in qualitative as well as quantitative terms.  In addition to formal \ncertification, teachers need to be provided skills and tools to adopt new approaches to nurture \npupils\u2019 creativity, problem-solving ability, and collaborative learning skills.  Empowering teachers \nto innovate, moving away from exam-focused rote instruction, will require creating support \namong headmasters and local educational officials, as well as effective networking mechanisms \nbetween them. To achieve UCE, special arrangements are needed to redress educational \ninequities (access, teacher quality, instructional materials, and physical conditions) in the poor \nareas and among disadvantaged communities. The TA will support applications of distance \neducation and other forms of ICT, and is therefore primarily intended to reduce East-West and \nurban-rural gaps. \n \n6.  Status of Distance Education and ICT applications in the PRC. The PRC has a long \nhistory of using television-based distance education for teacher training on a large scale, and \nnewer forms of ICT are now changing education and lifelong learning. The potential of distance \neducation and ICT is well recognized by national policymakers and international community.  \nThe Beijing Declaration on Education For All in the Nine High-Population Countries, signed in \nAugust 2001, underscores the need to prioritize related investments in basic education. If tightly \ntargeted, the renewed emphasis on distance education with the use of newer forms of ICT \nprovides an opportunity to advance UCE, including nonformal education, particularly in the \nwestern PRC.  \n \n7.  When used for applications such as teacher training, ICT is likely to enjoy economies of \nscale due to the PRC\u2019s large population base, while addressing needs created by the PRC\u2019s \nphysical size.  ICT tools will be especially key to reaching disadvantaged and poor populations \ndispersed  in  large  areas  of  the  Western  Region.  This  is  evident  in  the  PRC\u2019s  long  and \nsuccessful history of distance education, particularly in training teachers. Combining mature \ntechnologies (i.e., radio, television, and print) with newer forms of ICT such as computers and \nthe Internet, ICT applications could provide the much needed flexibility to address local needs.  \n \n8.  Several initiatives are under way to promote cost-effective use of ICT applications. The \nNational Research Center of Distance Education for Teachers at Beijing Normal University is \nsupporting the development of 30 experimental sites covering most provinces, except Inner \nMongolia, Tibet, or Xinjiang.  The center is currently developing multimedia materials for 35 \ncourses to support teachers, and plans to expand the number of sites and to provide over 200 \ncourses.  A key large-scale initiative is the National Distance Education for Poverty Reduction \nProject under the National Center for Education Technology (NCET) at the Ministry of Education \n(MOE).  Supported from several sources, NCET is providing equipment, teacher training, and \ninstructional materials to many primary and secondary schools (mostly at the township level) in \n ", "    3\nseveral poor counties in all Western Region provinces.4  Finally, China Central Radio Television \nUniversity (established in February 1979) has begun to use a digital, multimedia, and interactive \nplatform to build a multiple network system to support teacher training. \n \n9.  The  Government  wants  to  explore  the  use  of  ICT  in  education  in  three  areas:  (i) \ndevelopment of courses focusing on ICT as part of the national school curriculum; (ii) broader \nuse of distance education applications, especially in higher education; and (iii) applications of \nICT to reduce poverty, particularly in the Western Region. The Government has expressed \ngreat interest in the use of ICT to provide high quality content (i.e., training programs and \ninformation resources) to teachers, and has noted that the same tools can also provide practical \nmaterials to communities to promote local development.  \n \n10.  The Government also recognizes that investments in expensive computers and ICT \nequipment have often not been effectively exploited to improve education, and it increasingly \nrecognizes  the  need  to  provide  soft  components  (i.e.,  educational  content  and  materials, \ntraining  of  teachers  to  use  new  ICT  tools  for  innovative  teaching,  support  and  feedback \nmechanisms, etc.) to augment hardware investments.  This calls for developing sustainable and \noften locally-based strategies to mobilize financial and human resources needed, and to ensure \nthat ICT-based approaches are integrated into broader initiatives and change.   \n \n11.  Experience from different forms of ICT applications in the PRC points to three major and \nurgent needs: (i) development of educational materials to enhance the use of hardware; (ii) \nprovision of training to teachers in all subjects who haven\u2019t been exposed to ICT, to allow them \nto use ICT effectively; and (iii) provision of hardware to many areas that either do not have the \nequipment, or need more equipment. There is also a need to support innovative practices to \ndemonstrate how technologies could be used more cost-effectively. The general consensus \namong Government officials and education experts is that cost-effective distance education and \nICT applications should increase equitable access to quality education, particularly in poorer \nregions. The consensus is also that there is an urgent need to assess and draw lessons from \nICT  applications  being  implemented  under  different  programs  and  supported  by  different \nagencies. \n \n12.  Government Priorities. The PRC has intensified its commitment to improving access to \nquality education in poor areas in order to achieve UCE. To achieve UCE in poorer localities of \nthe Western Region, the PRC is making renewed efforts to reform the tax system and to \nstrengthen the institutional arrangements at the county level. These reforms are expected to \nincrease  resources  for  compulsory  education,  reduce  the  burden  of  existing  fees  on \nhouseholds, and develop capacity at the county level necessary to support more equitable \naccess to quality compulsory education. The Government is also revising the school curriculum \nand has raised the requirements for teacher qualification and teacher training to improve the \nquality of basic education. Both these reforms require tremendous efforts to upgrade teachers. \nDistance education and ICT applications are expected to contribute significantly to this process.  \n \n13.  Promoting  distance  education  and  other  ICT  applications  is  a  major  priority  of  the \nGovernment. The Government has emphasized ICT\u2019s potential in flexible applications to support \nteacher  training,  administrative  training,  school  management  improvement,  nonformal \neducation,  and  community  training.  The  Government  has  stressed  the  need  to  ensure \nsustainable use of technology, given the large capital and recurrent costs associated with newer \n                                                 \n4  Substantial financial support has been provided by the Hong Kong-based Li Kashing Foundation, while several \nplanned externally-assisted projects are aligned to varying degrees with the NCET project. \n ", "4   \nforms of ICT. For instance, major effort is being made to develop more cost-effective computers \nand simple media viewing equipment for a wider use. If well designed, ICT approaches can \nconsolidate different initiatives.  \n \n14.  External Funding in Distance Education and ICT Applications in Basic Education. \nSeveral funding agencies are supporting or planning to support NCET, which is responsible for \nthe National Distance Education for Poverty Reduction Project. Support is mostly targeted to \ntownship-level central primary schools, and includes training of teachers and school principals \nand content development.  \n \n15.  Distance education and ICT applications provide new opportunities to address the need \nfor training a large number of teachers, developing instructional materials to address diverse \nneeds  of  disadvantaged  children  in  the  Western  Region,  and  improving  the  access  of \ndisadvantaged children to quality compulsory education. Effective inter institutional linkages and \ncoordination  are  needed  to  support  research,  evaluation,  school-level  innovation,  and \neducational management. Teachers, students, and communities need training to prepare them \nto respond to new opportunities and challenges posed by economic restructuring and the PRC\u2019s \nentry into the World Trade Organization. The TA provides an opportunity to pilot test cost-\neffective applications of ICT as tools to support the Government\u2019s priority of improving quality \nand achieving UCE. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n16.  The TA aims to advance policy dialogue on targeted and viable applications of distance \neducation and ICT in the Western Region to improve quality and equity in basic education, \nemphasizing advances within the 9 year compulsory education system, literacy interventions, \nand related programs. The two objectives of the TA are to (i) undertake a broad assessment of \nand identify promising innovations and strategies for the applications of distance education and \nICT  in  education  with  a  particular  focus  on  supporting  access  to  quality  UCE  among \ndisadvantaged  populations  including  minorities,  women,  and  remote  communities;  and  (ii) \nsupport a very modest and targeted pilot testing of promising approaches and technologies with \na tight pro-equity focus. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  The TA will comprise two parts. Part I will undertake a rapid assessment of distance \neducation and ICT applications in education in supporting UCE, literacy interventions, and \nrelated programs.  The rapid assessment will provide a general background on where the PRC \nstands on ICT applications; what the current situation is in poor areas compared to better off \nareas;  what  has  been  done,  including  external  assistance,  to  address  the  needs  of \ndisadvantaged communities in particular; what are the major constraints in terms of teaching \nand learning; and what are the implications of ICT in addressing equitable access to quality \nbasic education, including its potential for upgrading teacher qualification and skills and student \nlearning. Following the rapid assessment and discussions with the MOE, the TA will undertake a \nfocused policy study covering one or two key areas, tentatively: (i) certificate teacher training \nand  teacher-headmaster  training  via  distance  education;  and  (ii)  continued  upgrading  of \nteachers, including innovative school improvement via ICT-based tools. \n \n ", "    5\n18.  Part II of the TA will support a modest and highly focused pilot test as defined during part \nI and in line with the policy study. Pilot site(s) will be identified following the assessment and \npolicy dialogue under part I. The pilot test will support compulsory education in poor areas of the \nWestern Region with demonstrated leadership initiatives for educational improvement. The pilot \ntest will also support an innovative program, avoid duplicating other efforts, and avoid areas with \na high concentration of other externally funded activities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n19.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, of which $166,000 is the foreign \nexchange cost and $459,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will finance $500,000 \nequivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $334,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $125,000 for office, \ncommunications,  local  travel,  seminars,  workshops,  translation,  and  secretarial  and \nadministrative support. The detailed cost estimates and proposed financing arrangements for \nthe TA are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  MOE will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MOE will establish a steering committee \nunder  the  chairmanship  of  the  director  of  the  Division  of  International  Organizations,  with \nrepresentation from the Department of Basic Education, Department of Minority Nationalities \nEducation, Division of Teacher Training of the Department of Teacher Education, Department of \nFinance, and NCET. The representative from NCET, which will be the Implementing Agency, \nwill be the secretary of the steering committee. The steering committee may be modified as \nappropriate following the needs assessment and identification of the pilot site. The steering \ncommittee will provide overall guidance and technical inputs to the TA, and help organize \nworkshops  in  partnership  with  interested  national  and  international  agencies.  Research, \nseminars, and workshops will be undertaken in partnership with other agencies as appropriate \nand to the extent possible. \n \n21.  The TA is planned to be completed over a two-year period (February 2003\u2013February \n2005).  During  the  first  3  months  (February\u2013April  2003),  the  TA  will  undertake  a  broad \nassessment of ICT applications in education and develop and propose the pilot test. The pilot \ntest will be implemented during the following 21-month period (May 2003\u2013February 2005). ADB \nwill select and engage the individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and \nengagement of domestic consultants. A team of consultants will provide a total of 10.5 person-\nmonths of consultancy services comprising 4.5 person-months of international and 6 person-\nmonths of domestic consultancy services. An international consultant will be identified as the \nteam leader responsible for overseeing the overall consultancy.  Outline terms of reference for \nthe consultant services are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.
