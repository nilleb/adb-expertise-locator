INTRODUCTION\n1. In December 1998, the countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS),1 all of which\nare members of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), requested ADB to provide technical\nassistance (TA) to update a 1996 power transmission study and prepare an indicative master\nplan for subregional transmission development up to 2020.2 The detailed terms of reference for\nthe TA were discussed and endorsed at the third meeting of the Experts Group on Power\nInterconnection and Trade (EGP) in October 1999 and were also endorsed at the ninth GMS\nministerial conference in January 2000.\n2. The master plan will be based on a work plan3 adopted by the second EGP and the fifth\nSubregional Electric Power Forum (EPF) meetings, in December 1998. The plan is expected to\nhelp GMS member countries plan and optimize their national power systems with the aim of\neventually connecting into a subregional grid system. The TA framework is shown in Appendix\n1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. The energy sector in the GMS is characterized by great diversity. The subregion is\nendowed with substantial energy resources, but their geographic distribution is uneven. The\nsubregion\u2019s countries have different types of energy resources and development costs vary\ngreatly. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Yunnan Province of People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (PRC), and to an extent Viet Nam have large untapped hydropower potential\nexceeding their own demand. Viet Nam and Yunnan Province have significant deposits of coal.\nThere are substantial reserves of natural gas, mainly in offshore fields in Myanmar, Thailand,\nViet Nam, and the Joint Development Area between Malaysia and Thailand. Thailand is energy\ndeficient and will increasingly rely on imports, despite considerable indigenous gas and lignite\ndeposits, and some oil reserves.\n4. Subregional  electricity  trade  based  on  interconnected  electric  power  networks  will\nprovide significant economic and environmental benefits for individual countries and the entire\nGMS. It will enable members to reduce national investments in the power reserves maintained\nto meet peak demand. Other benefits  will  include  (i)  a  more  reliable  supply  of  electricity,\nincluding power supply from an interconnected network in case of a power failure; (ii) lower\noperational  costs;  (iii)  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  other  pollutants;  and  (iv)\nconsumer access to the cheapest and most environmentally sustainable sources of electricity in\nthe subregion, i.e., hydropower and gas.\n5. As part of the program for economic cooperation in the GMS initiated by ADB in 1992, a\nsubregional  energy  sector  study,  under  phase  II  of  the  GMS  cooperation  program,4  was\nundertaken  to  provide  the  scope  of  cooperation,  required  framework,  and  recommended\nspecific  projects  or  project  concepts  that  would  promote  subregional  cooperation  for  the\n                                               \n1 Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan Province of People\u2019s\nRepublic of China.\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in March 2000.\n3 EGP requested (i) ADB financing for preparation of the policy statement and regional indicative master plan on\npower interconnection; and (ii) World Bank financing for preparation of the regional protocol and study for\nregulatory and institutional framework.\n4 TA 5535-REG: Promoting Subregional Cooperation Among Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam, for $4 million, approved on 10 June 1993.", "2\ndevelopment  of  the energy  sector. Based  on  the  study\u2019s  recommendations,  the  EPF  was\nestablished in April 1995 to (i) promote opportunities for cooperation in the power sector; (ii)\nfacilitate the implementation of priority subregional power projects; and (iii) address technical,\neconomic, financial, and institutional issues relevant to subregional power development. The\nEGP was created in June 1998 to discuss detailed work programs and recommend its findings\nto the EPF to (i) promote the development of a subregional transmission network, and (ii)\nfacilitate the expansion of cross-border power trade.\n6. In the GMS, power has been traded on a bilateral basis, mainly through long-term power\npurchase agreements. There is growing interest in cross-border power trade, spearheaded by\nregional and international developers who have commenced hydropower development in the\nLao PDR to sell power to Thailand. Large hydropower facilities are planned in Yunnan Province,\nto interconnect with Thailand. Such bilateral trade will bring about some benefits. But the full\npotential will not be realized unless an advanced degree of grid integration is achieved, i.e., until\nthe power grid is developed and operated in a coordinated manner, including a competitive\nsubregional electricity market.\n7. The following electric power projects of a subregional nature are currently ongoing or\nunder  consideration:  (i)  Nam  Leuk  Hydropower  Project5  in  the  Lao  PDR,  scheduled  for\ncompletion in 2000; (ii) Nam Ngum-Udon Thani 500 kilovolt (kV) line between the Lao PDR and\nThailand, for which a feasibility study has been completed; (iii) Nam Ngum 3 Hydropower\nproject in the Lao PDR; (iv) Se Kong-Se San and  Nam  Theun River  Basins  Hydropower\nDevelopment Study in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, for which the six most feasible sites\nhave been identified; and (v) a proposed power sector study for the Lao PDR.\n8. A  Mekong  integrated  transmission  system  study  was  started  in  June  1995  and\ncompleted in September 1996, financed by the Government of Japan and conducted by the\nMekong  River  Commission  Secretariat.  It  focused  primarily  on  the  lower  Mekong  Basin\ncountries, i.e., Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  However, Myanmar and Yunnan\nProvince in the upper Mekong Basin were included in an overall assessment of the situation and\na proposal for an interconnected network in the GMS. A power trade strategy for the GMS was\ndrawn up in January 1998 with World Bank support, paying particular attention to (i) the barriers\nto power trade; and (ii) the policy, institutional, and commercial framework required to develop\nand operate a subregional power network efficiently.\n9. The financial and economic crisis that hit Southeast Asia in mid-1997 brought with it the\nneed to reassess power sector development plans and expectations in the GMS. Slower growth\nin the subregion, and a contraction in demand in Thailand,6 will necessitate adjustments in the\nGMS electric power program even though the economic recovery is faster than anticipated.\nForecasts of demand for electricity will need to be scaled back, requiring a rescheduling of\npower  generation  projects  and  related  transmission  and  distribution  systems  development\nprograms. Another reason for adjusting the electric power program is the shortage of investment\ncapital, including locally generated funds. The ongoing power sector reform in Thailand will\naffect  the  GMS  power  sector.  The availability and  greater  economic  viability  of  advanced\ntechnology for combined cycle gas turbines has led to the extensive use of natural gas for\npower generation in the subregion, producing minimal greenhouse gases per unit of electricity\ngenerated. The study will also examine power generation and transmission plans in the key\n                                               \n5  Loan 1456-LAO, for $52 million, approved on 10 September 1996.\n6  The revised long-term power supply and demand forecast in Thailand reflecting the financial crisis is expected to\nbe completed by June 2000.", "3\nneighboring countries, such as (i) the proposed power interconnection between the PRC\u2019s\nGuangxi Province and Viet Nam, and (ii) the expected power trade between Malaysia and\nThailand, to seek least-cost options for power interconnections among GMS countries.\n10. To promote electric power interconnection and trade in the GMS, a policy statement on\npower trade was adopted at the sixth EPF meeting in October 1999 and endorsed at the ninth\nGMS Ministerial conference in January 2000. A regional protocol has been under discussion\nsince February 2000 to implement the policy statement and is expected to be ready by 2002.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n11. The main objectives of the TA are to (i) update the subregional transmission master plan\nproposed as part of the 1996 power transmission study, taking into account the recent economic\nchanges, ongoing power sector reform in Thailand, and increased viability of the use of natural\ngas  in  the  subregion;  and  (ii)  harmonize  transmission  planning,  design,  and  operational\npractices to promote subregional power trade.\nB.  Scope\n12. The scope of the TA will include (i) assessing electric power demand and reviewing\ngeneration  and  transmission  expansion  plans  in  the  GMS  and  neighboring  countries,  (ii)\nupdating plans for power grid interconnections on the basis of revised demand and supply\nprojections,  (iii)  formulating  an  indicative  transmission  master plan  to promote  subregional\npower  trade,  and  (iv)  identifying  the  institutional  and  regulatory  issues  that  need  to  be\naddressed to properly implement the plan. The outline terms of reference for the consulting\nservices that will be required are in Appendix 2.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $950,000 equivalent. The Government of Norway\nwill provide a grant of $742,000 under its Channel Financing Agreement with ADB, while ADB\nwill provide a grant of $158,000 from the Technical Assistance Special Fund. The participating\nGMS  countries  will  provide  the  remaining  $50,000  equivalent  in  kind.  Details  of  the  cost\nestimates and financing plan for the TA are in Appendix 3. ADB\u2019s approval of the TA will not\ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n14. The Executing Agency for  the  TA  will  be  ADB.  The  EGP  will  act  as  the  steering\ncommittee. It consists of two members from each GMS country, and representatives from ADB\nand the World Bank. The committee will be responsible for providing overall direction and\nguidance. The representatives of GMS member countries will assist in preparing and collecting\ndata, participate in the committee\u2019s meetings, and help organize the meetings as necessary.\nThe committee will meet at least two times during the study period or more often as necessary\nas part of EGP and EPF meetings. To conduct consultations with nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs) and stakeholders, an advisory panel will be set up. The panel will consist of three to five\nrepresentatives from NGOs and stakeholders with interest in the GMS and knowledge of power\ngeneration and transmission planning. The panel will (i) discuss the study\u2019s objectives with the", "4\nconsultants engaged to conduct it, (ii) review the consultants\u2019 reports, and (iii) attend EGP\nmeetings.\n15. The TA will be carried out by a firm of international consultants to be engaged in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will require about 22\nperson-months of international consulting services. A team of experts will be engaged from a\nfirm, with expertise in power interconnection between states and/or countries, including power\nsystem planning and economics, project finance, and assessment of the technical aspects of\nregulatory and institutional frameworks.\n16. The consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 1 month, (ii) an interim report\nwithin 7 months, and (iii) a draft final report within 12 months of the commencement of the TA.\nThese reports will be presented at EGP meetings and discussed by representatives of the GMS\nmember countries, ADB, and the World Bank. The indicative master plan is expected to be\ncompleted in 15 months starting October 2000.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB\nadministering a portion of technical assistance to be financed by the Government of Norway on\na grant basis in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $742,000, and (ii) the provision of\nthe balance of technical assistance to be financed by ADB on a grant basis in an amount not\nexceeding the equivalent of
