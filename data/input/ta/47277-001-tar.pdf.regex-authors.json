Pakistan\u2019s carbon  emissions  have  doubled  since  1990  largely  due  to  the  country\u2019s \ngrowing energy demand. The Government of Pakistan is committed to lowering its current \nemissions and has requested the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support \nthe implementation of its national climate change policy, particularly in mitigating climate change \nthrough development of technologies that help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The \ncapacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  not  included  in  the  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2014\u20132016 for Pakistan. The concept paper was approved on 21 February 2014.  \n \n2.  Reconnaissance and fact-finding missions were fielded in June and September 2013, \nwhere  the  government  and  the  ADB  mission  agreed  on  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference for the \nTA.1 The government requested ADB\u2019s assistance as indicated in its letter of 29 January 2014. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Carbon  emissions  in  Pakistan  grew  by  105%  from  152.79  million  tons  in  1990  to \n313.48 million tons in 2010.2 The significant increase in GHG emissions, particularly carbon \ndioxide (CO ), is mainly attributed to the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, transport, and \n2\nmanufacturing.  In  the  manufacturing  sector,  production  of  fertilizers  (ammonia),  cement, \nalternative fuels (methane and ethanol), iron, and steel contributed to more than 45% of CO  \n2\nemissions. The clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities also boosted \nGHG concentrations. GHG emissions will increase further with the anticipated diversification to \ncoal-fired power generation to reduce the power shortfall and cost of generation.3 Meeting \nPakistan\u2019s  energy  needs  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  makes  the  task  of \nmitigating its GHG emissions all the more challenging.  \n \n4.  In February 2013, Pakistan launched its first National Climate Change Policy, which \nunderscores  the  need  to  develop  low-carbon  technologies\u2014including  carbon  capture  and \nstorage (CCS)\u2014to reduce carbon footprints in agriculture, transport, and industry. In the energy \nsector, Pakistan is endowed with vast renewable energy resources such as hydropower, solar, \nand  wind.  The  government  is  promoting  hydropower,  wind,  solar,  and  natural  gas  project \ndevelopment and other low-GHG technologies for power generation. However, for a reliable, \naffordable, and secure electricity supply system, it needs a significant portion of power supply \nfrom fossil fuel power generation. The challenge of reducing emissions and simultaneously \nincreasing energy supply is daunting. Hydropower's contribution to the energy mix has declined \nfrom 72% in 1980 to 32% in 2012, whereas fossil power has increased from 28% to 61% during \nthe same period. Diversifying away from expensive fuel oil generation to coal will increase \ncarbon emissions further despite an increase in renewable energy in the medium term. CCS will \nbe a critical technology for meeting the country\u2019s goal of reducing carbon emissions. \n  \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 April 2014. \n2  World Resources Institute.

Islamabad. \n ", "2 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The TA will support the implementation of the first national climate change policy of \nPakistan, particularly mitigation of climate change impacts through development of technologies \nthat  help  reduce  GHG  emissions.  The  TA  will  explore  the  potential  of  CCS  by  devising \ndemonstration road maps, engaging in dialogue with the public and private sectors, and drafting \nrelevant policy statements. It will specifically look into CO -emitting sectors such as energy, \n2\nagriculture, transport, and industry for the purpose of determining the best type of demonstration \nroad maps. \n \n6.  The impact will be a CCS road map implementation in Pakistan that will boost CCS-\ninstalled capacity to 600 megawatts, and CCS-ready facilities to three by 2025. The outcome \nwill be improved capacity in planning and managing demonstration projects in Pakistan through \nat least one large-scale CCS demonstration plant committed for development by 2015. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n7.  The outcome will be achieved by conducting an assessment and evaluation of CCS \npotential in the country, developing a CCS knowledge dissemination program to ascertain key \nrequirements of CCS readiness, and training staff who will be involved in the planning, financing \nor implementing of CCS projects, and ultimately in formulating a road map identifying priority \ndemonstration  projects  during  2014  through  preparation  of  up  to  three  prefeasibility  study \nreports, including Clean Development Mechanism and other carbon-financing projects. \n \n8.  It  is  a  major  assumption  that  the  government  will  uphold  its  commitment  to  CCS \ndevelopment and that interest from development partners to assist in CCS implementation \nremains  high.  Major  risks  include  poor  coordination  between  CCS-relevant  agencies  and \ndevelopment partners, slow development of the technology in Pakistan, exorbitant cost of the \ntechnology, and the equivalent energy penalty and related impacts on tariffs becoming too \nimpractical. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.2 million equivalent, of which $1.0 million equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Carbon Capture and Storage Fund4 under the Clean Energy \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility  and  administered  by  ADB.  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of security, office space, counterpart staff, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  The Climate Change Division (CCD) reporting under the cabinet secretariat will be the \nexecuting agency. The CCD will be responsible for providing technical and policy support on the \ndevelopment and implementation of CCS projects, and advising the government in technical \nmatters related to CCS in Pakistan. The implementation of the TA will be supervised by ADB \nand will not be delegated to the executing agency. The CCD will be supported by a working \ngroup comprising the Planning Commission, Ministry of Industries, Ministry of Petroleum and \n                                                \n4  Financing partners: Global Carbon Capture Storage Institute and the Government of the United Kingdom. \n ", "3 \nNatural Resources, and Ministry of Water and Power. The working group will provide overall \nstrategic direction and review the outputs of the consultants. Periodic meetings will be organized \nfor the working group to discuss the progress of the TA. \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from September 2014 to August 2015. It will \nrequire 15 person-months (five experts) of international and 34 person-months (eight experts) of \nnational consultants. Required positions include CCS experts (team leader and deputy team \nleader), CCS experts on CO  capture, CCS experts on CO  storage, financial analyst, legal and \n2 2\nregulatory expert, CCS strategy analyst, energy economist and policy analyst, technology policy \nissues specialist, environment and climate change policy analyst, and coordinator. The team will \ncoordinate the periodic meetings, engage with all stakeholders, lead technical group meetings, \nand  prepare  documentation  as  required.  Consultants  are  expected  to  prepare  and  submit \ndocuments such as the CCS road map, prefeasibility study reports, and workshop proceedings. \nThe  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  ADB  will  engage  consultants \naccording to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nBecause of the highly specialized nature of the assignments and the limited number of experts \nin the field, the TA will be implemented by a team of international and national consultants, and \nindividual experts.5 \n \n12.   The  TA  will  organize  knowledge  dissemination  workshops  for  policymakers,  power \ngenerators, regulators, and private sector and other national stakeholders to feed in lessons \nfrom projects in Australia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, the Republic of \nKorea, and Malaysia, which will ensure ownership and allow participation from potential donors \nand investors. Resource persons will be recruited to assist in organizing the conduct of trainings, \nworkshops, and study tours. The TA will be monitored through assessment of quality and timely \ndelivery of outputs. Overall results of the TA are expected to be disseminated through regional \nenergy and climate forums, ADB\u2019s energy and climate change communities of practice, and \ncountrywide workshops. All disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nEquipment under the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of Pakistan to be financed on a grant basis by the Carbon Capture and Storage \nFund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for Determining the Potential for \nCarbon Capture and Storage, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n5  The preferred recruitment method would be through a firm using quality-based selection. If it cannot be done due to \nthe limited number of firms with the required expertise, consultants will be hired individually. \n ", "4         Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nCCS road map  Installed capacity of  Mention of CCS plans in  Government maintains \nimplemented   carbon capture and  strategic documents on  interest in CCS \nstorage grows to 600 MW  energy, industry sectors,  development and seeks \nby 2025 (2013 baseline:  and climate change  concessional financing \nnone)  mitigation \nDevelopment partners \nGHG emissions reduced  Draft policy statements  assist implementation \ndue to installed CCS  and regulatory directives  of the road map by \ncapacity of 600 MW by  funding feasibility \n2025 amounting to  studies, capacity \n3.13 million tCO e (or 10%  development, and \n2\nof Pakistan\u2019s GHG  knowledge \nemissions baseline as of  dissemination \n2012) \nRisks \nNumber of CCS-ready  Fragmented \nfacilities grows to 3 by  implementation and \n2025 (2013 baseline:  poor coordination \nnone)  between agencies and \ndevelopment partners \n   \nTechnology suitable for \n   \nPakistan is not \ndeveloped in time \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved capacity in  At least one large-scale  Draft government  Road map is cascaded \nplanning and  CCS demonstration plant  policies  down to CCS-relevant \nmanagement of  committed for  agencies \nConsultants\u2019 reports, \ndemonstration  development by 2015 \ntechnical assistance  Government is \nprojects   (2013 baseline: none) \nreports, and materials  committed to \nGovernment staff trained  for dissemination  implementing the \nto plan and manage  recommended \ndemonstration projects  regulatory, policy, \nincreases by 15 in 2015  technical, and financial \n(none as year 2013)  measures \n  Government is \ncommitted to factoring \n \nin geological and \n  storage options in \nmaking siting decisions \n   \nfor new sources \n   \nRisks \nCost of technology, and \nthe equivalent energy \npenalty and related \nimpacts on tariffs \nbecome too impractical \nResults of the \nprefeasibility study \n ", "Appendix 1          5 \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nreports show that no \nCCS project is viable  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
