INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Welfare  Improvement  Strategy  for  2012\u20132015  outlines  the  Government  of \nUzbekistan\u2019s  vision for national  development and  its  program for  achieving  more  inclusive \neconomic growth. The Rural Development Program (RDP) and the Rural Housing Scheme \n(RHS) are critical pillars of the strategy, which focuses on reducing urban\u2013rural disparity by \nimproving  rural  living  standards  and  increasing  rural  income  and  job  opportunities.  The \ngovernment has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance \n(TA) to improve the capacity of local governments to deliver these programs effectively. The TA \nwas discussed with the government during a mission in July 2012, and subsequently confirmed \nin a memorandum of understanding signed in November 2012. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  To  achieve  more  inclusive  economic  growth  in  accordance  with  the  Welfare \nImprovement Strategy and support implementation of the RDP and the RHS, local governments \nhave been tasked with important roles. These include (i) preparing and implementing strategies \nfor regional industrial development and investment promotion to create sustainable income and \njob opportunities, and (ii) identifying, prioritizing, and delivering effectively public infrastructure \nand social services to communities and local businesses. \n \n3.  Increasing  the  effectiveness  of  rural  development  through  wider  access  to \ninformation. To support the effective allocation of resources, local governments require access \nto district-specific social data and cross-sectoral information that will enable them to assess, \nidentify, define, and prioritize community needs. Development priorities and resource allocations \nare centrally determined by the national ministries and line agencies on the basis of the data \nthey  collect  and  analyze,  which  is  then  aggregated  in  accordance  with  sector-specific \nrequirements.  While  an  extensive  government  information  and  communication  technology \nnetwork has been established, data is not readily available to local governments. Information \nfrom each ministry needs to be available for shared access on the government portal, which \nserves  as  the  common  depository.  Access  to  such  information  can  be  restricted  to  the \noriginating agency or to selected agencies, or can be open to the public. Tiered access system \nmeans  all  information  can  remain  secure  or  be  made  available  to  a  wider  audience,  as \nappropriate.   \n \n4.  Improving  the  transparency  and  accountability  of  planning  and  resource \nallocation. Greater participation by local governments in planning and resource allocation will \nenable them to respond more effectively to the needs of communities, improve the coordination \nof  service  delivery,  and  increase  the  transparency  and  accountability  of  service  delivery \nagencies. It will also improve value for money and effectiveness of local government services. \nLocal  governments  lack  the  analytical  tools  and  templates  needed  to  prepare  baseline \nassessments, examine cross-cutting issues, identify priority community needs, and improve \nperformance  monitoring  of  agencies  responsible  for  delivering  industry  promotion  and  job \ncreation programs, as well as community infrastructure and social services.  \n \n5.  An approach has been piloted by the government with the support of the United Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  in  two  regions\u2013\u2013Jizzakh  and  Namangan. In  partnership  with  the \nInstitute of Forecasting and Macroeconomic Research (IFMR), a participatory approach to local \ndevelopment  and  strategic  planning  was  developed,  involving  the  private  sector, \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 December 2012.  \n ", "2   \nnongovernment organizations, and civil society. Data requirements were defined and sourced, \nassessment  and  planning  templates  were  developed,  and  e-government  options  explored. \nAssessment and adaptive replication of the approach are the planned next steps. \n \n6.  Improving local government capacity for results-based service delivery. Extensive \ncapacity building of local governments is required to strengthen the focus on needs and results \nin the delivery of public services. Capacity building will enable local governments to better \nassess  and  prioritize  community  needs,  profile  those  needs  to  responsible  agencies,  and \nstrengthen coordination between district and regional governments and among executive and \nline ministries. Regional governments need to work closely with the Ministry of Economy (MOE), \nthe Ministry of Finance, and respective line ministries to plan, finance, and implement public \ninvestment programs for the delivery of services. District governments, the government\u2019s front \nline and public face, are accountable to communities for program and service delivery.  \n \n7.  Better coordination will support a more effective use of resources. Under the RDP and \nRHS, regional and district governments have important coordination and oversight roles. For the \nRDP,  local  governments  coordinate  and  oversee  the  performance  of  diverse  government \nagencies  responsible  for  implementing  industry  promotion  and  job  creation  programs,  and \ndelivering community services. For the RHS, local governments coordinate and oversee (i) the \nselection and approval of new or expanded residential sites, (ii) community design and planning, \nand (iii) access to and delivery of infrastructure and social services. Capacity development of \nlocal governments to ensure fair, transparent, and timely delivery of these services is critical to \nrural development and improving rural livelihoods. \n \n8.  Government coordination and key agencies. Extensive stakeholder consultations and \ncapacity  development  of  key  ministries  and  agencies,  as  well  as  regional  and  district \ngovernments, are critical success factors. The ministries and agencies are: \n(i)  Ministry of Economy. The MOE has an important coordination role as the lead \nagency responsible for national and regional development, including national \ninvestment plans. The MOE also has overall responsibility for implementation of \nthe RDP and RHS, overseeing local government inputs, and developing and \nimplementing a results-based planning, monitoring, and reporting framework.  \n \n(ii)  Institute of Forecasting and Macroeconomic Research. The IFMR reports to \nthe Cabinet of Ministers and is mandated to analyze regional disparities and \nprepare  regional  development  plans,  support  improved  competitiveness  and \ninclusive economic growth, and accelerate private sector development and the \ncreation of sustainable income and job opportunities. The IFMR will guide and \nsupport  the  development  of  a  series  of  forms  and  templates  to  be  used \nnationwide for regional and district planning and results-based monitoring and \nreporting.  \n \n(iii)  Academy of State and Public Management. The Academy of State and Public \nManagement (ASPM) is mandated to deliver training to government officials from \nall levels of government to strengthen public administration nationwide. It will \nensure that curriculum development for results-based planning and reporting is \nfully integrated into local government training programs.2   \n \n                                                \n2  The ASPM offers specialized courses, certificate programs, and a master\u2019s degree in public administration. \n ", "  3 \n(iv)  Uzinfocom.  Uzinfocom  is  a  technical  agency  responsible  for  managing  the \ngovernment portal, and providing technical support for downloading, cataloguing \nfor  easy  retrieval,  and  ensuring  the  information  security  of  all  e-government \napplications.  With  its  network  of  regional  offices  and  district  focal  points, \nUzinfocom  will  also  deliver  operational  and  technical  information  technology \nsupport across the government.  \n \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  Uzbekistan  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016 \napproved in September 2012,3 and is included in the country operations business plan, 2012\u2013\n2014.4 The  TA  advances  the  objectives  of  the  country  partnership  strategy  by  promoting \ngovernance,  institutional  improvement,  and  capacity  development.  The  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme and the World Bank both include in their programs a number of \nprojects and technical support activities for local government capacity building and delivery of \ninfrastructure and social services. Coordination will continue in order to ensure synergy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA impact will be improved service delivery by local governments. The outcome will \nbe improved results-based planning capacity for local governments in Uzbekistan. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have three outputs:  \n(i)  Development of a local government results-based planning, monitoring, \nand  reporting  framework.  A  results-based  regional  and  district  planning \nframework will be developed by the IFMR in close coordination with the MOE and \nwith  the  participation  of key  stakeholders (including  community-based  social, \nwomen, and youth organizations). The framework will improve the planning for \nregional industrial development and job creation, and increase transparency in \nthe  prioritization  of  local  government  needs  and  investments  based  on \nmeasurable  results-based  targets.  Following  testing  and  pilot  implementation \nacross representative regions, implementation will be rolled out nationwide. \n \n(ii)  Development  of  a  local  government  capacity  building  program.
