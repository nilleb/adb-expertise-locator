As natural resources underpin economic development and\npoverty  reduction  prospects,  the  Government  attaches  priority  to\nconserving  the  environment  and  ensuring  the  environmental  and\nsocial sustainability of all development activities.\nImproving  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards\nperformance has been the subject of considerable policy dialogue\nand technical assistance. Enactment of the Environment Protection\nLaw (EPL) in 1999 was a breakthrough. Together with environmental\nprovisions in laws on electricity, roads, land, water resources, and\nforests, the EPL provides a framework for implementing safeguards.\nHowever, effective enforcement requires the adoption of enabling\nregulations,  compliance  mechanisms,  and  measures  to  enhance\nGovernment capacity and financial sustainability. Without these, the\nintegration  of  environmental  management  and  social  safeguard\nissues across sectors will remain elusive.\nThe Government aims to go beyond case-by-case remedial action on\nenvironmental and social impacts, toward a proactive approach that\nintegrates these concerns within national, sectoral, and area-based\nplanning.  The  Government  has  sought  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) assistance to develop and implement a program aimed at\nputting the country on a more sustainable development trajectory,\nfocusing initially on the energy and transport sectors. This will require\naddressing  five  closely  related  sets  of  constraints:  (i)  incomplete\npolicy and regulatory framework; (ii) lack of implementation capacity\nat  sectoral  and  provincial  levels;  (iii)  inadequate  compliance  and\nenforcement  mechanisms;  (iv)  absence  of  integrated  area-based\nplanning frameworks to guide investments in energy and transport;\nand (v) insufficient attention to sustainable finance for environmental\nmanagement.\nObjectives and The objective is to support the Government\u2019s policy reform agenda\nScope for improved environmental management and social safeguards in\nthe energy and transport sectors. The Program covers five closely\nlinked priority areas for policy action: (i) strengthening national policy", "iii\nand regulatory framework for environmental management and social\nsafeguards;  (ii)  enhancing  policy  implementation  measures  and\ncapacity at sectoral and provincial levels; (iii) improving compliance\nand enforcement; (iv) promoting river basin management as a multi-\nsectoral and integrated planning framework for energy and transport\ndevelopment;  and  (v)  establishing  sustainable  financing\nmechanisms, including an environment fund.\nClassification Environmental protection\nEnvironmental The Program is classified as category B.  Environmental implications\nAssessment were reviewed, and no significant negative impacts were identified.\nThe ADB Loan\nLoan Amount A loan of SDR15,648,000 ($20 million equivalent) is proposed from\nand Terms ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a repayment\nperiod of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years. An interest\nrate of 1 percent will be charged per annum during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nProgram The program period will be 36 months (2002-2004). The proposed\nPeriod and loan is to be disbursed in three tranches. The first tranche of $5.0\nTranching million will be made available upon loan effectiveness. The second\ntranche of $10.0 million will be disbursed within 14 months after the\nfirst  tranche,  subject  to  the  Government\u2019s  compliance  with  the\nconditions set for the release of that tranche. The third tranche of\n$5.0 million will be made available when the Government establishes\nan environment fund during the 36 months of loan utilization.\nExecuting The Science, Technology, and Environment Agency (STEA) will be\nAgency the Executing Agency for the Program, in close coordination with the\nCommittee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC); Ministry of Finance\n(MOF); Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction\n(MCTPC); Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts (MIH); and Ministry of\nAgriculture and Forestry (MAF). STEA will have overall responsibility\nfor  ensuring  effective  implementation  of  the  Program.  MOF  will\nmonitor the use of the loan proceeds and counterpart funds.\nProcurement The  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs,\nexcluding local duties and taxes, of imports procured in and from\nADB member countries, other than items specified in the ineligible\nlist  and  those  financed  by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  official\nsources.  Procurement  of  eligible  items  under  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  be\nbased  on  normal  commercial  practices  for  procurement  by  the\nprivate  sector,  or  standard  Government  procurement  procedures\nacceptable to ADB for procurement by the public sector. In the case", "iv\nof  goods  commonly  traded  on  international  commodity  markets,\nprocurement  will  follow  procedures  appropriate  to  the  trade  and\nacceptable to ADB.\nCounterpart The Government will use counterpart funds generated by the loan to\n(i) finance additional public investment costs in the transport and\nFunds\npower  projects  to  ensure  strengthened  social  and  environmental\nsafeguards;  (ii)  build  institutional  capacity  to  plan,  design,  and\nenforce  environmental  and  social  safeguards;  (iii)  provide  local\ncounterpart resources for development projects aimed at river basin\nplanning  and  management;  (iv)  address  the  mitigation  costs  of\nexisting infrastructure where social and environment costs were not\nadequately addressed;  and (v) establish an environment fund.\nRisks and Sustained  political  commitment  is  essential  to  effective  program\nSafeguards implementation. A risk is that more immediate economic problems,\nsuch  as  the  reemergence  of  regional  and  domestic  economic\ninstability,  could  divert  policy  makers\u2019  attention.  However,  ADB\nexperience in financing energy and transport projects has shown\nthat major social and environmental risks will continue to be the\nsubject  of  high-profile  attention  among  stakeholders.  Continued\ndialogue,  solid  analysis  of  the  longer  term  benefits  of  social\nsafeguards  and  environmental  management,  consultative\nmechanisms  with  aid  agencies  and  civil  society,  and  public\nawareness  campaigns  are  built  into  the  Program  to  maintain\ncommitment.\nIt can be expected that weak institutional capacity and limited human\nresources will handicap efforts to address environmental and social\nimpacts. The Program therefore reflects an incremental approach\nthat is tailored to the realities of limited implementation capacity, and\nthe need to introduce policy reforms in a structured and sequential\nfashion.  The  Program  has  been  designed  to  combine  both\nimmediate policy actions, where there is sufficient basis to proceed,\nand  flexibility  to  progressively  adapt  and  expand  initiatives  in\nresponse to increased information and lessons from implementation.\nEffective environmental management and rigorous enforcement of\nsocial  safeguards  will  require  continued  allocation  of  adequate\nresources across a wide spectrum of activities. To minimize the risk\nof insufficient resource allocation, the Program includes measures to\nstrengthen compliance monitoring, reviews of longer term resource\nneeds and priority setting, a range of measures and mechanisms\naimed  at  ensuring  sustainable  finance  for  environmental\nmanagement,  and  the  priority  allocation  of  counterpart  funds  for\nProgram-related activities. Program measures to track environment\nallocations  in  the  annual  budgetary  process  will  allow  greater\ntransparency and enrich continued policy dialogue on this issue.", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Environment and Social\nProgram.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In September 2000, the Government of the Lao PDR requested the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) to provide program assistance to strengthen social safeguards and environmental\nmanagement in the energy and transport sectors. This request followed a process of policy\ndialogue and capacity building that included advisory technical assistance (TA)1 to strengthen\ninstitutional  capacity  in  the  energy  and  transport  sectors  and  to  develop  strategies  and\nguidelines  for  improved  performance.  Subsequently,  a  small-scale  TA2  was  implemented\nbetween December 2000 and March 2001 to help the Government further develop the proposed\nenvironment and social program, including consultations with a wide range of stakeholders. The\nGovernment  informed  the  May  2001  Country  Programming  Mission  that  the  preliminary\nprogram proposal was generally acceptable and requested that the proposed Program be\nprocessed for approval in 2001. The Program and its policy matrix were further developed\nduring  a  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  June  2001  and  confirmed  by  an  Appraisal  Mission3  in\nSeptember 2001.\nIII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA. Development Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n3. The  Government\u2019s  development  priorities  are  presented  in  its  Strategies  for\nSocioeconomic Development until 2020 and 5th Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan\n(2001-2005). The Government aims to reduce the proportion of poor families by more than half\nby 2005; to eradicate poverty and stop shifting cultivation by 2010; and to graduate from being a\nleast developed country by 2020 by transforming a mostly subsistence economy to a natural\nresource-based industrialized economy. The strategy is to reduce poverty through sustainable\neconomic growth by focusing on (i) agriculture and forestry, (ii) education, (iii) health, and (iv)\nroad  infrastructure.  The  strategy  calls  for  greater  people\u2019s  participation  in  development\nprocesses and the gradual decentralization of Government responsibilities. Accelerated human\nand institutional developments are seen as prerequisites to realizing the development of goals.\nThe Government recognizes that governance is a vital link between economic growth and\npoverty reduction, and that environmental sustainability is a prerequisite to sustaining economic\ngrowth and reducing poverty.\n                                                \n1 TA 3133-LAO: Strengthening Social and Environmental Management Project, for $950,000, approved on 22\nDecember 1998.\n2  TA 3535-LAO: Energy and Transport Socio-Environmental Management, for $150,000, approved on 10 November\n2000.\n3  The Mission comprised N. J. Ahmad (Senior Policy Coordinator, ENVD/Mission Leader); S. Chander (Senior\nProject Engineer, IWEN); S. Lateef (Senior Social Development Specialist, SOCD); G-H Kim (Programs Officer,\nPW3); R. O'Sullivan (Counsel, OGC); and A. Siddiq (Project Economist, AWFN).", "2\nB. Recent Economic Performance and Prospects\n4. Macroeconomic instability in 1997-1999, triggered by the regional crisis and exacerbated\nby  expansionary  fiscal  policies,  threatened  to  undermine  economic  development.  Foreign\ninvestment inflows and Government revenues dropped sharply after 1997. Tighter fiscal and\nmonetary policies from mid-1999 helped to stabilize the economy and, despite three years of\neconomic instability, economic growth averaged 6.2 percent per annum during the last five\nyears. Annual inflation fell from 128 percent in 1999 to less than 10 percent by mid-2001.\nDespite recent improvement, average per capita income was only about $330 in 2000. The Lao\nPDR and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) entered into an agreement for loan financing\nunder IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility in April 2001. Successful implementation of\nthe reforms agreed-upon under this facility will lay the foundation for greater economic stability,\nand more sustainable and equitable economic growth.\n5. The Government targets broad-based economic growth of 7.0\u20137.5 percent per annum\nover the next five years. Past performance and regional experience suggest this is an ambitious\ntarget, not the least in the context of the international economic slowdown. In the longer term\nsuch growth rates may be achievable, but would require that the following challenges be\naddressed: developing a competitive and open market economy, improving labor productivity\nthrough  improved  health  and  education,  and  strengthening  the  capacity  to  deliver  more\nsustainable benefits from the management of natural resources and the environment. Recent\ninitiatives to attenuate policy, institutional, and infrastructure constraints to regional integration\nprovide improved opportunities for investments in energy, transport, trade, tourism, and other\nservices. In particular, the Lao PDR is well placed to develop energy as a major source of\nexport earnings due to its substantial hydropower resources and strategic location. To achieve\nnational  socioeconomic  development  goals  in  public  finance  and  investment  appropriate\nenvironmental management and social safeguards can help attract the necessary increased\ncommercial investments from established international investors.\nC. Public Finance and Investment\n6. A major challenge in realizing development goals is the domestic resource constraints to\nfinancing  recurrent  and  development  expenditure.  Weaknesses  in  tax  collection,  public\nexpenditure planning and management, and reliance on official development assistance (ODA)\nfinancing of public capital expenditure remain problematic. The Government recognizes that it\nwill need to attract increased private investment to help bridge the domestic investment-savings\ngap in financing its ambitious development agenda. This is particularly important because of the\nurgent need to increase the share of current spending in total public expenditure so as to\nensure the sustainability of capital investments. This need for increased current expenditure is\nparticularly evident in the social sectors, and also for environmental management purposes.\nThe current capital/current expenditure ratio is partly the result of a very high dependence on\nexternal financing of budget expenditure. The Government targets call for an increase in current\nexpenditure from 6.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1999 to more than 10 percent\nin 2003.\n7. Program lending can assist in relieving the most pressing recurrent expenditure needs,\nbut the Government recognizes that the only sustainable solution is to increase public revenue.\nThe  external  financing  gap  is  currently  projected  at  about  $110 million  during FY2001/03.4\nGrowth in foreign exchange earnings is an essential element of the Government's efforts to\n                                                \n4 Government of Lao PDR. 2001. Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy. 20 March.", "3\nreduce ODA dependence. Socially appropriate and environmentally sustainable investments in\ntransport infrastructure and hydropower generation capacity to facilitate the development of\ntrade, tourism, and hydropower exports are required to increase market opportunities and boost\nfiscal revenue in the medium term. To jointly address public finance concerns, the Government,\nADB, IMF, and World Bank will complete a public expenditure review (PER) in late 2001 that\ncovers the poverty focus of public expenditures, the balance between recurrent and capital\nexpenditures allocations, fiscal transparency, and mechanisms for expenditure planning and\nmanagement.  An  action  plan  will  be  developed  to  implement  the  agreed-upon\nrecommendations of the PER. Given that provinces account for about 30 percent of public\ninvestment, it will be important to improve efficiency by building capacity at this level, including\nintroducing social and environmental safeguards in provincial planning, implementation, and\nmonitoring activities.\nD. The Socioeconomic Setting\n8. The  Lao  PDR  ranks  132nd  out  of  162  countries  according  to  the  United  Nations\nDevelopment Programme's (UNDP\u2019s) 2001 human development index. Poverty incidence in the\nLao PDR declined from 45 percent in FY1992/93 to 39 percent in FY1997/98, but there is\nconsiderable disparity in poverty incidence across regions and provinces as well as between\nurban and rural areas. The concentration of poor and ultrapoor households and communities is\nhighest in the northern provinces and lowest in Vientiane Municipality. The incidence of poverty\nis  greatest  among  communities  in  rural,  more  remote,  and  mountainous  areas.  While\nconsumption  inequality  is  less  than  that  in  many  other  Asian  countries,  it  has  increased\nmarkedly in the last five years. The Gini coefficient increased from 28.7 percent in FY1992/93 to\n34.3 percent in FY1997/98. According to the 2001 participatory poverty assessment (PPA),\npoverty in the Lao PDR is generally linked to livelihood systems, including agriculture and\nforestry production, rural infrastructure, basic education, and primary health care. Most of the\npopulation depend directly on natural resources for their livelihood. Poorer communities are\nespecially vulnerable to negative environmental and social impacts of large-scale infrastructure\ndevelopment projects. Improved management of environmental and social concerns will be\nessential to protect and improve the livelihoods of the poor and to increase the options available\nfor poverty reduction. This is important in an economy where a few large hydropower projects\nare likely to dominate export earnings and budget revenue, but will create relatively few jobs\ndirectly.\nIV.  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS IN\nENERGY AND TRANSPORT\nA. Background\n1.  Environment\n9. The  Lao  PDR  has  a  land  area  of  236,800  square  kilometers  (km2),  bounded  by\nMyanmar to the northwest, People\u2019s Republic of China to the north, Viet Nam to the east,\nCambodia to the south, and Thailand to the west. Two main physical features, rivers and\nmountains, dominate the topography, and their interaction accounts for most of the country\u2019s\ngeographic, biological, and social variation. A total of 1,865 km of the 4,000 km long Mekong\nRiver flows through the Lao PDR or along its border with Thailand. The Lao PDR contributes 26\npercent of the drainage area of the Mekong River and 40 percent of its water resources, thereby", "4\nmaking the country the largest single contributor of water to the Mekong River. The country also\nhas the largest per capita volume of freshwater at 66,000 cubic meters/person, which amounts\nto 20 times the regional average.\n10. A broad range of natural systems representing many vegetation types is found in the\ncountry. These are a variety of forest types, grasslands, water bodies, and wetlands, all of\nwhich are habitats for a wide range of wildlife. Most of the indigenous vegetation in the Lao PDR\nis associated with forests. According to official data from the National Forest Inventory, forests\ncover  approximately  11.2  million  hectares,  or  47.2  percent  of  the  country.  The  dominant\nevergreen  forest  types  are  dry  or  semievergreen  forests  and  hill  evergreen  forests.  The\ndominant forest types are mixed deciduous. About half of these woodlands \u2013 a very high\nproportion \u2013 can be classified as primary forest, while another 30 percent or so represent\nsecondary growth. The Lao PDR ranks 11th in the world in terms of percentage of natural forest\ncover. However, deforestation is occurring at an annual rate of 0.6-0.8 percent.\n11. Forests, wetlands, and other natural areas harbor approximately 10,000 species of\nanimals and vascular plants. Within Southeast Asia, the Lao PDR is second only to Cambodia\nin the number of species by land area. Twenty-five species found in the Lao PDR are globally\nendangered. Most of the fauna belongs to the Indochina zoogeographic realm. In terms of\nfaunal  biodiversity,  the Wildlife in Lao PDR: 1999 Status Report  produced  by  the  World\nConservation Union (IUCN) states that 319 out of 1,140 species included in the review are\nsignificant for national or global conservation, i.e., 67 percent of the large mammals, 53 percent\nof the bats, 6 percent of the insectivora, 14 percent of the murid rodents, 22 percent of the birds,\n25 percent of the reptiles, and 2 percent of the amphibians. The Lao PDR is thought to have\nsome of the last populations of Javan rhinoceros, kouprey, and Siamese crocodiles in the world.\nThree large mammal species new to science were discovered in the Lao PDR and neighboring\nareas of Viet Nam in the past decade, an unparalleled event in modern science. The Lao PDR\nhas established 20 national biodiversity conservation areas (NBCAs) covering 13 percent of the\ncountry.\n12. The population of the Lao PDR consists of some 48 distinct ethnolinguistic groups\ncomprising three main groups who respectively populate the lowlands, the medium altitudes,\nand  the  more  remote  highlands  and  mountainous  areas.  Each  group  has  developed  a\nsignificant culture, knowledge, and experience that is tailored to the natural resources available\nto them, and that is reflected in their dominant livelihood systems. These groups have strong\nties to the land and natural resource base. Forests and rivers provide the rural people with food\nplants,  meat,  medicines,  fish,  resins,  building  materials,  and  other  products  for  domestic\nconsumption and income generation. These natural resources serve as buffer stocks in times of\nhousehold food insecurity, and when natural disasters occur.\n13. With  the  Lao  PDR  confronting  increasing  environmental  and  natural  resource\nmanagement issues that impact across all economic sectors, the Government has undertaken\nsome important policy and institutional measures to bolster its capacity to manage its rich\nnatural  resources  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Several  laws  addressing  natural  resource  and\nenvironmental management issues have been passed in recent years: the Forestry Law (1996),\nthe Water and Water Resources Law (1996), the Land Law (1997), the Electricity Law (1997),\nthe Mining Law (1997), the Road Law (1999) and the Environment Protection Law (EPL)\nadopted in 1999. These laws provide the foundations to better protect the environment and\npeople from the potential adverse impacts of economic development.  However, their effective", "5\nenforcement has been hampered to a large extent by the absence of implementing regulations\nand frameworks for implementation.\n14. The EPL stipulates the fundamental principles, regulations, and measures required for\npreserving and managing the environment as well as for the efficient and sustainable use of\nnatural resources. The fundamental principles of the EPL include (i) emphasizing environmental\nconservation  before  mitigation  and  restoration,  (ii)  integrating  environmental  protection  into\nsocioeconomic development planning, (iii) requiring all persons and organizations to contribute\nto environmental protection, (iv) requiring those who cause damage to the environment to be\nresponsible for mitigation and compensation, and (v) avoiding pollution and waste through the\ncareful use of natural resources. The EPL also foresees the establishment of an environment\nprotection fund to finance environmental management activities.\n15. The EPL assigns to the Science, Technology, and Environment Agency (STEA) the\nmandate to monitor and coordinate all environment-related actions. STEA coordinates and\nsupervises environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for industrial, agricultural, forestry, and\nhydropower  development.  STEA  also  prepares,  coordinates,  oversees,  and  monitors\nenvironmental policies, regulations, and guidelines, and the preparation and dissemination of\nenvironmental information. As part of its coordination role, STEA houses the Water Resource\nCoordinating Committee (WRCC) and provides the secretariat for the Interministerial Working\nGroup on Environment (IMWGE). The WRCC, formed in 1998 with STEA as chair, is tasked\nwith coordinating activities associated with the Water and Water Resources Law and includes\nall major ministries in its membership. The IMWGE is a mid-level group that meets occasionally\nto discuss technical issues related to environmental management.\n16. The mandate of the Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts (MIH) covers a number of\nsectors, including electricity, geology, mines, and industry and handicrafts. MIH is responsible\nfor (i) administering the EIA process for industry sector and energy sector projects, and (ii)\nissuing regulations and establishing standards for wastewater discharge, air emissions, noise,\nand  industrial  waste.  The  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Post  and  Construction\n(MCTPC)  has  a  mandate  that  encompasses  urban  development  and  the  planning  and\nmanagement  of  transport  and  communication  infrastructure.  MCTPC  is  responsible  for\naddressing  environmental  management  and  social  concerns  in  infrastructure  planning  and\ndevelopment, and administers the associated EIA process.\n17. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has a crucial role in promoting the\nsustainable  use  of  natural  resources  (soil,  forest,  water,  fish,  and  biodiversity)  for  rural\ndevelopment. The Ministry of Justice has wide-ranging influence in preparing, enforcing, and\nmonitoring  all  laws,  decrees,  and  guidelines,  including  those  dealing  with  social  and\nenvironmental concerns. The Committee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC) is responsible for\nnational planning processes. Augmenting CPC\u2019s role are the National Land Use and Forest\nLand Allocation Committee, and the National Rural Development Committee. These committees\nhave important roles in involuntary resettlement and compensation procedures, especially in\nallocating land in upland areas.\n2.  The Energy Sector\n18. The  Lao  PDR  has  a  technically  exploitable  hydropower  potential  of  about  18,000\nmegawatts (MW), of which 623 MW of generation capacity has been developed through seven\nhydropower  plants.  Public  investment  has  financed  the  development  of  263  MW, with two", "6\nindependent power producers (IPPs), Theun Hinboun (210 MW) and Houay Ho (150 MW),\naccounting for the remainder. The country's rich hydropower resource endowment already\nprovides  an  important  source  of  foreign  exchange  earnings  and  budget  revenue.  Annual\nGovernment revenues from electricity exports are expected to increase from $44.9 million in\n2000 to $136 million in 2010. However, opportunities for tapping the remaining potential are\ntempered by the emergence of competing energy sources in export markets, a less buoyant\ninvestment  climate,  and  legitimate  social  and  environmental  concerns  about  inappropriate\nhydropower development. The Lao PDR has one of the lowest levels of electrification in Asia\nwith only 30 percent of the population and 2 percent of rural households connected to the power\ngrid. Low domestic tariff rates mean that export sales are subsidizing the few, mostly urban,\ndomestic consumers who are connected to the power grid.\n19. Overall responsibility for the power sector is vested in the Department of Electricity\n(DOE) in MIH. Under the Electricity Law (approved 1997), DOE is responsible for preparing and\nimplementing  sector  legislation  and  regulations,  overseeing  the  performance  of  electricity\nenterprises, and for formulating policies and strategic planning. Within DOE, the Hydro Power\nOffice (HPO) is responsible for strategic power planning, identifying projects, and evaluating IPP\nproject  proposals,  while  the  Rural  Electrification  Division  is  the  focal  unit  for  off-grid\nelectrification. A small environmental management and monitoring unit is attached to HPO.\nElectricit\u00e9 du Lao (EdL), a state-owned corporation, develops, and partly owns and operates the\ncountry\u2019s  main  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  assets;  and  manages  electricity\nimports to its grids and exports from its stations. Responsibility for off-grid projects rests with the\nrelevant local authorities or concessionaires. The Lao National Committee for Energy manages\nthe development and marketing of export power projects and negotiates on behalf of the\nGovernment. It monitors and reports on power sector issues. The Electricity Law requires that\nall projects greater than 50 MW be approved by the Government and the National Assembly,\nand that all projects between 2 and 50 MW be licensed by the Government. Smaller projects\ncan be licensed by the relevant local authorities.\n20. Eleven major hydropower projects, with a total design capacity of 4,000 MW, are in the\nplanning or advanced planning stage for implementation during the next 10 years. Eight projects\nare expected to be built on an IPP/build-operate-transfer basis. The total capital cost of the\ncurrently proposed IPP projects over the period to 2010 is about $5 billion in current prices, with\nanother $350 million required to develop a 500-kilovolt (kV) line to Thailand. However, it is\nunlikely that all projects will be implemented in the next decade. Preparations for the largest IPP,\nNam Theun 2 (1,088 MW), are well advanced and construction is expected to be completed in\n2006. EdL plans to develop four of the smaller projects.\n3.  The Transport Sector\n21. Road transport development has absorbed a large share of public investment and ODA\nexpenditure  during  the  last  decade.  Progress  in  expanding  transport  infrastructure  has\nfacilitated all-weather road access for most of the north-south corridor of the country. The\ncountry has 26,000 km of roads. However, only 4,600 km of the roads are all-weather routes, of\nwhich 2,400 km are paved. Only half the national roads are paved, most provincial roads remain\nunpaved,  and  many  provincial  roads  are  impassable  during  the  rainy  season.  Most  rural\ncommunities  do  not  have  year-round  road  access  to  markets.  Poor  transport  infrastructure\nremains a constraint to poverty reduction and economic development.", "7\n22. Responsibility  for  transport  planning  and  regulation  in  the  Lao  PDR  rests  with  the\nMCTPC. The organization and activities of MCTPC are defined in Decree 66/PM (12 May\n1999). The Road Law, approved by the National Assembly in April 1999, provides the legal\nframework for road sector development and assigns MCTPC responsibility to manage land for\nroad  development  as  stipulated  in  the  Land  Law.  MCTPC  works  with  CPC  and  STEA  in\ndeveloping transport strategies and investment plans. Within MCTPC, the Department of Roads\n(DOR)  is  responsible  for  road  transport  development.  Responsibilities  for  social  and\nenvironmental mitigation activities in the road sector currently rest with a small environmental\nmanagement and monitoring unit in an administrative division of DOR. During the last five\nyears,  MCTPC  has  delegated  some  responsibilities  to  provincial  level  departments  of\ncommunication, transport post and construction (DCTPC) so as to increase local participation\nand a sense of ownership.\n23. The development and improved maintenance of road transport infrastructure are the main\nelements of the Government strategies to increase rural access to market opportunities, and to\nincreased national and regional economic integration. MCTPC estimates that it will require $90\nmillion per annum over the next 10 years to fund road sector development and maintenance.\nAnnual funding for the next five years is directed toward (i) routine and periodic maintenance\n($11.5 million per year); (ii) rehabilitation of secondary roads and three national roads (route\n13N from Phonhong to Pakmong, route 13S from Paksan to Savannakhet, and route 6) and\nstrategic national roads linking population centers ($6.6 million per year); (iii) development of all-\nweather links to all provincial capitals and national roads providing regional, cross-border links\n($47.6 million per year); (iv) priority secondary and rural roads to provide all-weather access\nbetween district centers and the national network and other priority projects ($16.6 million per\nyear); (v) Mekong bridge crossing ($5 million per year); and Vientiane City roads ($2.8 million\nper year). This ambitious transport development program is not fully funded.\nB. Environmental Management and Social Safeguard Issues and Constraints\n1. Issues\n24. Natural  resources  play  a  central  role  in  the  economy  of  the  Lao  PDR.  Forestry\ncontributes 7-10 percent of GDP and is the only major agricultural export. Water resources\n(through hydropower generation) now account for an important share of foreign exchange\nearnings. Hydropower export earnings are expected to remain a major source of growth in the\nfiscal revenues needed to fund service delivery and basic infrastructure to improve health,\neducation, and other social services. Rural access roads, designed with appropriate safeguards\nand  nested  within  integrated  rural  development  strategies,  can  promote  resource-based\neconomic development and reduce poverty. They can simultaneously decrease pressure on\nnatural resources by providing access to markets, services, and technology that allow farmers\nto intensify agriculture and turn away from sometimes destructive shifting cultivation practices.\nAppropriately  designed  roads  can  also  provide  opportunities  for  ecotourism  development,\nincluding access to NBCAs for tourists whose user fees can contribute to their protection.\n25. The quality and productivity of the natural resource base is also vital to the well-being of\nrural communities, which account for 85 percent of the country\u2019s population. Forests and rivers\nprovide rural people with food plants, meat, medicines, fish, resins, building materials, and other\nproducts for home consumption and income generation. Fish harvested from rivers and other\nwetlands provide a significant proportion of total animal protein consumed in the country. These\nnatural \u201call-purpose shops\u201d serve a vital social security function, especially during times of rice", "8\ndeficit and when natural calamities decimate agricultural harvests. For many rural households,\naccess to these resources can mean the difference between maintaining their homes and being\nforced to move to new lands or urban areas.\n26. Experience  in  the  Lao  PDR  confirms  that  road  and  hydropower  projects  can  pose\nsubstantial environmental and social risks. Many such risks are associated with direct impacts\nin the projects\u2019 zones of influence that result from decisions regarding project location, design,\nand  construction  activities.  Such  impacts  are  in  principle  identifiable,  if  not  always  easily\navoided or mitigated. Risks include loss of forest cover; changes in hydrological regimes,\ndeterioration in water quality, and loss of fisheries; degraded agricultural land due to riverbank\nerosion  or  displacement  by  alternative  development;  and  involuntary  resettlement,  social\ndislocation, and impingement on rural livelihood systems.\n27. Indirect impacts during project implementation are similar, but often more insidious and\nlonger term in nature. They may include widespread environmental degradation, including loss\nof watershed cover and a collapse of river ecology. Profound changes to community health and\ncultural traditions may be induced due to new or improved access to previously isolated areas:\nincreased  illegal  trafficking  in  women  and  children;  spread  of  infectious  diseases  such  as\nsexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV/AIDS;5 and unplanned development and in-\nmigration that displace, marginalize, or impoverish existing communities.\n28. Where environmental and social impacts are not foreseen and addressed appropriately,\nthe outcomes can undermine national development goals and contribute to increased economic\nand social hardship among the affected populations. Populations most affected by hydropower\nand roads developments are often subsistence ethnic minority communities living in the least\naccessible parts of the country. They often have little capacity to cope with potential adverse\nimpacts that large infrastructure projects can have on production, productive assets and income\nsources; community structures, social networks, and cultural identity. Infrastructure projects\ndisperse kin and other mutual support groups; and introduce new diseases and/or aggravating\nendemic diseases such as malaria, dysentery, and measles. Given the fragile nature of these\ncommunities and the resources on which they depend, even minor impacts can result in severe\nand long-term economic and social hardships that exacerbate their impoverishment.\n29. The recently conducted PPA identified relocation due to development projects as a\ndirect cause of poverty in some communities. The Houay Ho project is one example of a\ncompleted hydropower project with no resettlement plan, resulting in people suffering from a\nsevere shortage of food and arable land, and insufficient water supply. Remedial action to\nalleviate the most pressing hardships was finally undertaken in 1999 at an approximate cost of\n$2.4 million.6 Likewise, the ADB-financed Theun-Hinboun Hydropower Project7 has decreased\nfisheries and fundamentally changed water regimes, thereby affecting the capability of about\n3,000 households to maintain their pre-project livelihoods. Late mitigation can be costly, as\nevidenced by the $5 million budget required for the new Theun-Hinboun mitigation plan. The\ncosts of fishery and terrestrial habitat loss in the Nam Kading NBCA downstream of the dam\nhave yet to be fully assessed.\n30. The  problems  associated  with  previous  hydropower  development  projects  must  be\navoided in the future. Reactive responses to correct problems are not in the national interest.\n                                                \n5  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n6 World Bank Hydropower Development Strategy Study, Volume D.\n7 Loan 1329-LAO, for $60 million, approved on 8 November 1994.", "9\nUnless measures are carefully planned and implemented, poverty reduction efforts will be\nnegated and the Government risks not meeting its goal of halving the level of poverty incidence\nby the year 2005. Conversely, potential contributions of infrastructure development toward\nimproving livelihoods, increasing market access, extending the delivery of social services, and\ngenerally stimulating economic development will be lost. In today\u2019s investment climate, failure to\ndemonstrate an overall framework and capacity to manage social and environmental impacts\nwill deter much-needed external financing by private sector interests as well as bilateral and\nmultilateral sources.\n31. There are also regional and international dimensions to these risks. The way natural\nresources are used in the Lao PDR can have strong ripple effects in neighboring countries.\nThailand  now  imports  2,682  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of  power  from  the  Lao  PDR  and\nunderstandings has been reached for future imports requiring an additional generating capacity\nof 1,500\u20133,300 MW. Cambodia and Viet Nam rely on the Lao PDR to protect its rivers, fisheries,\nand forested uplands from development activities that could profound by impact on the diet,\ncommerce, and safety of large downstream populations. Plans to develop ecotourism in the\nGreater Mekong subregion will fall short of expectations if the country is unable to attract\ntourists due to degraded landscapes and decreasing wildlife. At an international level, Lao\nPDR\u2019s stewardship of internationally endangered species and biodiversity conservation are\ncentral to global environmental objectives. Emerging concerns are also being expressed about\nthe  potential  incremental  emission  of  greenhouse  gases  from  reservoirs  due  to  rotting\nvegetation and carbon inflows from the catchments.\n32. Indications  of  the  magnitude  of  potential  problems  are  detailed  in  the  Lao  PDR\nhydropower development strategy which estimated that 16 of the 30 potential hydropower\ndevelopment  sites  would  affect  NBCAs  and/or  areas  of  significant  biodiversity  value.  If\nimplemented, projects would affect varying numbers of people. Together, the projects could\ninvolve the relocation of 33,000 people. Transmission lines, access roads, or construction\nactivities could affect another 14,000 people. Another 390,000 people downstream, and another\n190,000 upstream in immediate catchment areas could also be affected (footnote 5). The\nhydropower strategy study estimates that the total cost of social and environmental impacts for\nthese projects could be between $770 million and $2.8 billion, depending on the standards that\nare followed. While few of the 30 potential sites may be developed within the foreseeable future,\nand many will never be developed, the estimates from the study are illustrative.\n33. Road transport sector development plans call for some $734 million to be invested in\ndeveloping and maintaining the road network over the next 10 years. Past experience with road\ndevelopment in the Lao PDR suggests that, without substantial improvements in planning and\nmitigation measures to address environmental and social concerns, the potential social and\nenvironmental  impacts  of  future  road  developments  are  likely  to  be  significant.  Without\nimproved safeguards, there are strong risks of increased erosion, illegal logging, deforestation,\nand biodiversity losses, and there will be inadequate safeguards for persons or communities\nadversely  affected  by  road  development.  Failure  to  implement  improved  planning,  public\nconsultations, environmental management, and social safeguards in the road sector would\nmean that potential synergies in public investment will be lost, and potential benefits, especially\nin terms of reducing poverty and increasing economic opportunities, will not be fully realized.\n34. A river basin planning approach will allow policy makers to optimize the benefits of\nnatural resource management within the whole basin\u2014from upper watersheds that are prone to\nerosion,  to  lower  plains  that   are  affected  by  frequent  floods. In  the  longer term,  such  an", "10\nintegrated  approach  will  yield  considerable  benefits  by  facilitating  sustainable  watershed\nmanagement and soil conservation, flood protection and mitigation, fisheries preservation and\ndevelopment, and irrigation development.  Resource management in these subsectors has not\nbeen optimized in the past due mainly to lack of a legal framework that will govern the water\nrights  and  allocations  to  different  sectors,  and  the  unclear  delineation  of  roles  and\nresponsibilities of relevant line agencies. Lack of integrated area-based planning in the Lao\nPDR has also affected development in the power sector. A recently completed study8 indicates\nthat  uncoordinated  development  may  have  hampered  growth  and  resulted  in  delays  in\nhydropower development. As one immediate component of an eventual river basin approach,\nimproved management of the watersheds that cover 80 percent of the country will be vital to the\nsuccess of planned and current hydropower projects. Area-based planning activities in critical\nwatersheds will also be needed to ensure that potential direct and indirect impacts of rural roads\ndevelopment can be avoided or managed.\n2. Constraints\na.  Incomplete Policy and Regulatory Framework\n35. The Government has taken important steps toward a comprehensive framework for\nenvironmental  management  and  social  safeguards  by  adopting  the  EPL  in  1999.\nNotwithstanding the progress made, in the absence of the relevant enabling decrees and\nsectoral implementing regulations to underpin stated policies on the environment, Government\nagencies  and  others  can  be  presented  from  ensuring  that  social  and  environmental\nconsiderations are properly addressed by developers and contractors of major infrastructure\nprojects.  The  overall  framework  needs  further  strengthening  so  that  roles,  functions,  and\nresponsibilities are clear; regulations, standards, and procedures are articulated; and necessary\nbudgetary and human resources are allocated to address these concerns. Limited capacity\nneeds to be used more efficiently and effectively through better interministerial coordination and\ndivision of labor, as well as through enhanced coordination of external support to environmental\nprograms.\n36. The Government is aware that it must address gaps in involuntary resettlement and\ncompensation policies for major projects. Currently, no national policy exists that articulates\nuniform  standards,  although  the  fundamental  principles  of  protecting  affected  people,  the\npayment of compensation, and restoration of livelihoods are enshrined in the Constitution and\nother laws. However, none of these laws deals coherently and systematically with the entire\nprocess  of  resettlement  and  compensation,  or  assigns  oversight  responsibility  to  any\nGovernment  agency  or  institution.  Consequently,  social  and  resettlement  impacts  are\naddressed either as salvage operations, or at best, in an ad hoc and unplanned manner.\nPlanning, managing, and monitoring social impacts remain a secondary, low-priority, side-effect\nof infrastructure development. A significant barrier to making the transition from project-by-\nproject reactive responses to well-planned proactive interventions is the lack of a clear policy\nand institutional framework for mitigating and managing adverse social impacts. Without such a\npolicy the Government risks not meeting the safeguard provisions in their own policies and the\ninternational standards required to attract external financing and to foster investor confidence.\n37. Recognition and support for public involvement and participation are contained in all key\nlegislation. The EPL has a specific provision on the need to consult with project-affected people\nin the EIA process. Yet, a clear Government policy that provides the framework for the conduct\n                                                \n8 TA 3374-LAO: Power Sector Strategy Study. Draft final report, August 2001.", "11\nof public consultations is absent. Without a policy framework that codifies the adoption of public\ninvolvement and participation, directives contained in other legislation will remain unrealized.\nProjects  will  continue  to  be  developed  and  implemented  without  proper  consultation  and\nparticipation of affected communities in decisions relating to their social and economic well-\nbeing.  A  pressing  constraint  to  the  development  of  appropriate  and  culturally  suitable\ndevelopment projects and mitigation packages for large infrastructure projects is the lack of\nunderstanding  and  knowledge  about  the  needs,  priorities,  and  willingness  and  capacity  of\naffected communities to adapt to new economic conditions and physical environments. In the\nabsence  of  institutionalized  processes  for  consultation  and  participation  of  stakeholders,\nincluding affected communities, proper planning, implementation, and monitoring of projects will\nnot be achieved.\nb.  Weak Capacity at Sector and Subnational Levels\n38. Weak or nonexistent capacity for social and environmental protection is a reality in all\ndevelopment sectors. The situation needs urgent improvement, especially in the hard sectors\nwhere  the  scope  and  magnitude  of  impacts  are  wide-ranging,  significant,  and  sometimes\nirreversible. In addition to creating direct impacts on the environment and people's lives, major\ninfrastructure projects can alter the dynamics of natural resource management and livelihood\nsystems at a local level and can have a profound influence on the spatial patterns of agricultural\nand rural development. Generally, mechanisms for integrating the environment into strategic\nplanning  are  absent,  procedures  are  not  clear,  guidelines  not  formalized,  and  criteria  not\ndisclosed. The relevant line agencies have neither formally adopted sector-specific regulations\nnor issued guidelines. They also lack the corresponding institutional arrangements to coherently\naddress the issues from a project-specific, let alone strategic planning, perspective.\n39. In the energy and transport sectors specifically, some progress has been made in EIA\ntraining and the drafting of EIA guidelines, and practical experience has been gained in working\nwith multilateral financed projects. Technical assistance has been useful, although it has been\nfragmented and not always tailored precisely to meet institutional needs. Against this backdrop,\nMIH and MCTPC continue to deal with environmental and social concerns on a reactive and ad\nhoc basis depending on the specific due diligence requirements, if any, of the private sector and\naid agencies. Sector-specific ministerial guidance on project-related involuntary resettlement\nand  compensation  is  absent,  and  public  involvement  procedures  are  lacking.  Although\nrudimentary  environment  units  have  been  established  within  the  two  ministries  and  are\nbeginning  to  play  a  useful  role,  they  are  not  yet  equipped  with  the  relevant  institutional\nmandates, appropriate human resources, and necessary budget to perform an adequate job.\n40. While more effective institutional arrangements for environmental policy and regulation\nwill continue to be needed at the central level, the absence of fully functioning provincial and\ndistrict institutions is a cause for concern. The EPL assigns to agencies at subnational level a\nsubstantial role in managing the environment and in enforcing safeguards; however, under the\nGovernment's  decentralization  strategy,  provincial  agencies  are  called  upon  to  perform  a\nnumber  of  mandates,  and  provincial  budgetary  processes  have  not  tended  to  favor\nenvironmental  regulatory  functions  over  other  competing  priorities.  As  a  result,  provincial\nscience, technology, and environment offices (STEOs) have been created in several provinces,\nbut  are  not  in  a  position  to  discharge  their  responsibilities  under  the  EPL.  One  such\nresponsibility  is  preparing  of  provincial  environmental  action  plans,  which  could  provide  a\nreasoned  and  credible  basis  for  prioritizing  tasks  and  allocating resources across agencies", "12\nconcerned with environmental management. In addition, the functional linkages and distribution\nof tasks between STEA and the STEOs need to be further clarified.\nc. Insufficient Compliance and Enforcement\n41. There is a need to promote compliance with and enforcement of the EPL and other laws\nwith provisions for environmental management. Lack of awareness among civil society and the\nGovernment of environmental and social safeguards embodied in the law is one fundamental\nconstraint. A related constraint is lack of codification and knowledge of legal mandates and\nimplications of the EPL; legal recourse for enforcement and compliance; and civil and criminal\nsanctions such as warnings, fines, revocation of licenses, civil sanctions, and criminal charges.\n42. In the energy and transport sectors, measures are needed to enhance transparency,\npredictability, accountability, oversight, and control. The adoption and application of sectoral\nregulations  and  guidelines  on  EIA,  involuntary  resettlement  and  compensation,  and  public\ninvolvement will be necessary, but not sufficient conditions. MIH and MCTPC need to ensure a\nsatisfactory  compliance  record  in  their  respective  sectors.  Neither  agency  currently  tracks\ncompliance on a systematic basis, nor issues sector compliance reports. In response to the\nrequirements of project financiers, the Government has on occasion accepted third-party project\nmonitoring arrangements. These arrangements have been tested in the case of the World\nBank-supported Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project, the ADB-financed Nam Leuk Hydropower\nProject, and the recently approved Rural Access Roads Project.9 However, the Government\ncurrently lacks an established system and procedures for third-party monitoring that would be\nrequired  for  all  sensitive  projects.  The  Government  could  also  usefully  explore  new  and\ninnovative ways of achieving compliance. One option is the use of performance bonds that will\nbe an incentive for developers and contractors to implement environmental and social mitigation\nmeasures and will provide insurance in the event of noncompliance.\nd. Need for Integrated Resource Management Approaches\n43. With few exceptions, road and hydropower projects to date have been designed within a\nrelatively limited definition of \u201cproject zone of influence.\u201d For roads, this has normally meant a\nnarrow band between major nodal points corresponding to larger settlements. For hydropower\nprojects,  it  has  been  restricted  to  the  area  of  project  works,  sometimes  extending  to  the\nimmediate  upstream  and  downstream  river  environs.  Roads  and  energy  sector  plans  and\nprojects need to be situated within a broader area-based planning context, if cumulative and\nsynergistic impacts are to be adequately addressed, and if trade-offs are to be appropriately\nmanaged.  The  Government  has  yet  to  fully  adopt  a  holistic  area-based  planning  and\nmanagement approach to ensure the best use of land and water resources.\n44. An integrated resource management approach is desirable to promote awareness of the\nlinks  between  water  and  land  use,  the  environment  and  sustainable  development.  The\nGovernment's initiatives to introduce this approach have been assisted by ADB through several\nTAs leading to the preparation of the Water Law and elaboration of issues relevant to river basin\nplanning and management. Consultations with the stakeholders have helped the Government\ndevelop  the  National  Water  Sector  Profile  and  Water  Sector  Strategy  and  Action  Plan\n(WSSAP). The WSSAP addresses cross-sectoral issues by emphasizing appropriate policy,\ncommunity  education,  and  data  management.  As  a  first  step  toward  building  capacity  to\n                                                \n9 Loan 1456-LAO: Nam Leuk Hydropower Project, for $52 million, approved on 10 September 1996; and Loan 1795-\nLAO: Rural Access Roads Project, for $25 million, approved on 7 December 2000.", "13\nimplement  its  new  policies  and  plans,  the  Government  established  the  Water  Resources\nCoordinating Committee in February 1998.10 The Government has been implementing the most\nimportant elements of the WSSAP through policy development,11 and has already prepared a\ndraft water policy. The upper Nam Ngum watershed area has also been studied in detail, and\ndraft policies and investment proposals for expanded development opportunities and enhanced\nenvironmental mitigation efforts have been prepared.12 Under the ongoing project preparatory\nTA for Nam Ngum River Basin Development,13 the river basin profile, a river basin action\nagenda, and a medium-term investment strategy and plan for the river basin will be prepared.\nThe  proposed  project  will  include  investment  components  relating  to  sustainable  soil\nconservation and fisheries development, integrated irrigation management, and flood control.\n45. The Government has made steady progress in water sector reforms since 1997 by (i)\ncarrying out a sector study, (ii) adopting the Water and Water Resources Law; (iii) establishing\nthe WRCC as a water sector apex body, and (iv) initiating the formulation of a water policy and\na draft implementing decree. A critical next step is to issue the decree to implement the Water\nLaw, which will clarify agency responsibilities and formalize the river basin planning approach.\nIn view of the capacity constraints, the Government recognizes that further sector reforms\nshould be implemented progressively under an integrated resource management approach in\nthe country's most important river basins, starting gradually with the Nam Ngum river basin and\nother  basins  where  hydropower  might  come  onstream.  In  the  short  to  medium  term,  the\nGovernment  will  simultaneously  pursue  area-based  planning  and  watershed  management\nactivities consistent with an overall river basin approach.\ne. Lack of Sustainable Financing\n46. A continuing constraint to implementing the country\u2019s development strategy is poor\ndomestic resource mobilization and utilization. Budget revenues are low as a percentage of\nGDP and, despite recent improvements, weaknesses remain in public investment planning and\npublic  expenditure  management.  These  constraints,  coupled  with  a  high  dependence  on\nexternal  assistance,  have  resulted  in  inordinate  imbalances  between  current  and  capital\nexpenditure. Limited availability of current budget resources constrain social service delivery,\nand means that public infrastructure is often underutilized and poorly maintained. Compounding\nthese  problems  is  the  lack  of  systematic  incorporation  of  environmental  management\nconsiderations  in  sector  planning,  public  investment  planning,  and  public  expenditure\nmonitoring. Appropriate planning to address environmental concerns is constrained by lack of\ninformation on national and provincial-level spending on the environment. Given the limited\nresources and a growing focus on allocating limited public resources to human development\nand poverty reduction, the Government wants to attract increased private sector financing for\nhydropower and transport sector development. Recent economic difficulties and institutional\nweaknesses  leave  policy  makers  especially  vulnerable  to  pressures  to  accept  investment\narrangements  that  may  be  suboptimal  in  terms  of  long-term  sustainable  development.\nProcedural  and  regulatory  reforms,  combined  with  capacity  building  and  human  resource\ndevelopment,  are  required  to  mitigate  these  risks.  However,  lack  of  adequate  financial\nresources  for  critical  environmental  management  and  regulatory  tasks  will  constrain  the\nintroduction  and  enforcement  of  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards.

Government Objectives and Strategy\n47. The  Government's  overall  environment  strategy  is  presented  in  the  National\nEnvironment Action Plan (NEAP). First adopted by the Government in 1994, the NEAP was\nupdated with ADB assistance (footnote 1) in 2000 after a consultation process that incorporated\nthe views of national and local stakeholders. NEAP 2000 provides a guide to STEA, sector\ndevelopment agencies, and others at the central and local levels for taking actions that foster\nsustainable development. It highlights priorities for environmental protection during 2001-2005:\n(i) strengthening the policy and institutional framework; (ii) improving capacity within sectoral\nand subnational agencies; (iii) issuing environmental quality standards on water, air, and land;\nand (iv) capacity building and training.\n48. In  the  energy  sector,  the  Government  aims  to  accelerate  power  development  and\nsubstantially increase power exports. The Government's Power Sector Policy Statement (March\n2001) sets out two overall goals: (i) promote economic and social development by providing an\naffordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity supply; and (ii) promote power generation for\nexport as an additional revenue base for meeting development objectives. To achieve these\ngoals the Government intends to reform the legal and regulatory framework to facilitate power\ndevelopment,  and  optimize  the  institutional  structures  so  as  to  clarify  responsibilities  and\nstreamline administration. The Government's Strategic Directions for the Development of the\nRoad Sector (June 2000) sets out the long-term goals of MCTPC, together with objectives and\nstrategies over the period 2000-2015. The main objectives concern (i) poverty reduction, (ii)\ngood governance, (iii) private sector participation, (iv) regional transport network, (v) financial\nsustainability, and (vi) minimizing environmental and social impacts.\nD. External Assistance\n49. External assistance has financed about 80 percent of public investment in recent years.\nMost  funding  agencies  have  addressed  environmental  management  and  social  safeguard\nissues as an integral part of broader development activities. ADB, Global Environment Facility,\nUNDP,  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP),  Australia,  Denmark,  Germany,\nNorway,  and  Sweden  are  supporting  and/or  planning  technical  assistance  to  improve  the\ninstitutional,  policy,  and  regulatory  framework  for  environmental  protection,  as  well  as  to\nenhance implementation capacity at central, sectoral, and provincial levels (Appendix 1). The\nWorld Bank, Finland, Sweden, and the European Commission (EC) have been active in the\nforestry sector. Several nongovernment organizations (NGOs), such as IUCN and the World\nWildlife  Fund,  are  supporting  environmental  conservation,  raising  public  awareness  of\nenvironmental  issues,  and  helping  monitor  and  identify  adverse  impacts  of  development\nprojects. Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are expected to continue to support the strengthening\nof  central  and  provincial  institutions  responsible  for  planning  and  enforcing  social  and\nenvironmental safeguards, and thereby contribute to program implementation.\n50. The transport sector has absorbed a large share of ODA in recent decades, receiving 56\npercent  of  all  ODA  between  1996  and  2000.  Major  external  development  partners  in  the\ntransport sector are ADB, Australia, Germany, Japan, Sweden, UNDP/United Nations Capital\nDevelopment  Fund,  and  World  Bank.  External  assistance  for  transport  has  been  directed\ntoward  road  development  and  maintenance,  plus  development  of  some  airports. ADB  has", "15\nplayed  a  leading  role  in  supporting  Government  efforts  to  improve  subregional  transport\nlinkages. Most aid agencies have addressed resettlement, social, and environmental issues as\npart of transport development projects, but there has been little progress toward developing and\nimplementing national standards for transport development.\n51. ADB has been the major multilateral funding agency in the energy sector, supporting\ninstitutional development, subregional cooperation, private investment, power generation and\ndistribution, and rural electrification. UNDP and Australia have been working with DOE of MIH\nand EdL to improve social and environmental safeguards in the power sector. The World Bank\nis involved in rural electrification in the southern provinces and the preparation of the Nam\nTheun 2 Hydropower Project. International private developers are actively involved in energy\nsector development, and NGOs are active in raising awareness of the social and environmental\nimplications of hydropower developments.\nE. ADB\u2019s Country and Sector Strategies\n1. Past Operations and Strategy\n52. ADB\u2019s involvement in the energy and transport sectors in the Lao PDR spans 30 years\nduring which it extended some 22 loans and funded 45 TA projects. Energy and transport\nsectors together have accounted for 60 percent of project lending and about 30 percent of TAs\nsince ADB started country operations in 1968. Both sectors remain high priorities to achieve\nsustainable pro-poor economic growth, and remain a major focus of ADB operations.\n53. In the energy sector, ADB-financed power sector projects have contributed to increases\nin budget revenue and foreign exchange earnings. ADB support has also played a catalytic role\nin attracting additional private financing and cofinancing. The sector strategy will entail support\nto the Government's efforts to (i) develop capacity to manage power sector development in an\nenvironmentally sustainable and socially conducive manner; (ii) support the rationalization of\ntariff structures; (iii) develop hydropower projects, where technically and financially feasible, for\nboth export and domestic consumption purposes; (iv) develop transmission and distribution\nsystems;  (v)  extend  rural  electrification  and  use  renewable  energy  wherever  feasible;  (vi)\npromote private sector involvement; and (vii) further regional cooperation.\n54. In  the  transport  sector,  ADB  has  contributed  to  substantial  progress  in  expanding\ntransport infrastructure, increasing the access of many towns to national and regional markets,\nand developing institutional capacity of transport agencies. ADB\u2019s sector strategy foresees\ncontinuing its role to support transport development with the objectives of poverty reduction,\nprivate  sector  development,  and  national  and  regional  integration.  ADB  will  focus  on  (i)\ndeveloping economic corridors with subregional linkages, and (ii) improving rural access roads\nto facilitate market linkage. The strategy also emphasizes ADB's commitment to pay increased\nattention  to  ensuring  that  social  and  environmental  concerns,  as  well  as  opportunities  to\nmaximize  economic  benefits,  are  integrated  at  the  early  stages  of  the  transport  planning\nprocess.\n55. ADB  has  been  active  in  providing  TA  for  national  environmental  planning  and\nmanagement,  as  well  as  socio-environmental  management  in  the  transport  and  energy\nsectors.14 This has included assistance in revising the NEAP, support for drafting national and\n                                                \n14 TA 2734-LAO (footnote 11), TA 3133-LAO (footnote 1), and TA 3535-LAO (footnote 2).", "16\nsectoral  regulations  and  guidelines  on  EIA  and  involuntary  resettlement,  assistance  in\nformulating  draft  environment  quality  standards,  and  institutional  strengthening  and  human\nresource  development  within  STEA,  DOE  in  MIH,  and  DOR  in  MCTPC.  ADB  is  currently\nprocessing a TA for capacity building for environmental and social management in energy and\ntransport,  which  will  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  Program.  The  TA  will  cover  (i)\nstrengthening compliance and enforcement mechanisms; (ii) establishing sustainable financing\nmechanisms for environmental and social management, including an environment fund; and (iii)\nrefining the policy framework for involuntary resettlement and compensation, and seeking public\ninvolvement in these processes.15\n56. Sustainable  environmental  management  is  a  thematic  priority  of  ADB's  2002-2004\nCountry Strategy and Program (CSP) for the Lao PDR. The CSP identifies a number of areas\nfor potential priority support: (i) strengthening institutional capacity for policy implementation and\nregulatory enforcement, including social and environmental impact assessments; (ii) systematic\nconsultations with all stakeholders on social and environmental issues, and increased capacity\nand transparency in environmental monitoring and assessment; (iii) investment support for river\nbasin  development  and  stabilization  of  shifting  cultivation;  (iv)  community-based  natural\nresource management; and (v) continued involvement in regional environmental initiatives.\n2. Relevant Lessons Learned\n57. ADB has provided four program loans to the Lao PDR, two each in the agriculture and\nfinancial  sectors.16  Despite  delays  in  meeting  some  agreed-upon  conditions,  the  loans\ncontributed to pushing forward key policy and institutional reforms in the two sectors. Lessons\nlearned from these programs as well as country-specific lessons on environmental management\nand social issues in the energy and transport sectors are summarized in Appendix 2. Lessons\nlearned from program lending to the Lao PDR include the need to (i) ensure country ownership\nof the program; (ii) provide clear analysis of the rationale for proposed policy reforms; (iii) allow\nadequate  lead  time  for  consultative  processes  before  issuance  of  new  legislation  and/or\nregulations and to specifically address enforcement issues; (iv) correctly assess absorptive\ncapacity and incorporate capacity-building activities as an integral part of the program; (v)\nprovide well-designed TAs before and during program formulation, to sustain policy reform\ndevelopment; (vi) focus reform efforts on a manageable package of priority reforms that are\ncritical to realizing program objectives; (vii) better sequence and integrate reforms within the\nnational  development  agenda;  (viii)  recognize  limited  national  capacity  to  monitor  program\nimplementation; and (ix) establish clear performance criteria to facilitate program monitoring.\n58. Most  transport  and  energy  projects  in  the  Lao  PDR  have  had  adverse  social  and\nenvironmental  impacts.  These  impacts  were  not  anticipated  during  identification  and\nformulation,  and  generally  were  inadequately  addressed  during  project  construction  and\noperation. The oversight has caused unnecessary environmental damage and human hardship,\nand has weakened investor and aid agency confidence. Experience in  the  Lao  PDR  suggests\n                                                \n15TA 3746-LAO: Capacity Building for Environment and Social Management in Energy and Transport, for $600,000,\napproved on 22 October 2001.\n16Loan 0965-LAO: Agriculture Program Loan, for $20 million, approved on 3 August 1989; Loan 1061-LAO: Financial\nSector Program, for $25 million, approved on 6 December 1990; Loan 1180-LAO: Second Agriculture Program, for\n$30 million, approved on 8 October 1992; and Loan 1458-LAO: Second Financial Sector Program, for $25 million,\napproved on 12 September 1996.", "17\nthat a regulatory framework and clear rules of the game are needed to ensure that potential\nsocial and environmental impacts are identified at an early stage, and that adequate mitigation\nmeasures are incorporated in project designs. A second problem is that inadequate account is\ntaken of existing and planned developments, natural resources, existing land use, and local\ninstitutional  capacity  during  infrastructure  planning.  This  increases  costs  and  eliminates\npotential  beneficial  synergies,  reducing  economic  and/or  financial  returns.  It  has  become\nobvious that efforts to avoid or minimize social and environmental impacts at the project level\nmust begin at the time that sector strategies and programs are being formulated.\n59. The quality of social and environmental impact assessments and resettlement action\nplans has varied greatly depending on the amount of time, expertise, and funding available.\nWith  the  promulgation  of  the  EPL,  the  aim  is  for  all  projects  to  meet  the  same  national\nstandards, depending on the magnitude and scale of the project. This will require consistency in\napproach and application of regulations. In addition, many projects in the transport and energy\nsectors  were  identified  and  designed  with  inadequate  social,  environmental,  economic,\ninstitutional, and spatial baseline information. A coordinated effort is required to develop a\nrational and structured national information management system. A final lesson is that public\ninvolvement during planning, construction, and implementation stages has been rudimentary,\nwith  no  national  guidelines  to  direct  this  process.  Consequently,  planners  often  failed  to\nunderstand the full range of project impacts on local residents and village life, and thus missed\nopportunities for maximizing development impact. Heightened awareness by the population of\ntheir rights and responsibilities can help increase transparency and accountability, and facilitate\nincreased compliance.\nV.  THE PROGRAM\nA. Rationale\n60. The Lao PDR is a small landlocked country with mountainous terrain, low population\ndensity,  limited  pool  of  skilled  human  resources,  and  a  wealth  of  natural  resources  and\nenvironmental  assets,  including  globally  significant  biodiversity.  The  Government  aims  to\ntransform and diversify the country's predominantly resource-based economy while maintaining\nmacroeconomic stability and promoting economic growth. The country's economy depends\nprimarily  on  natural  resources  in  the  forest,  mining,  tourism,  fisheries,  agriculture,  and\nhydropower  sectors.  Since  natural  resources  underpin  economic  development  and  poverty\nreduction  prospects,  the  Government  is  acutely  aware  of  the  importance  of  conserving\nenvironmental  resources  and  ensuring  the  environmental  and  social  sustainability  of  all\ndevelopment activities.\n61. Adoption  of  a  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  environmental  management  and\nsocial safeguards has been the subject of considerable policy dialogue and TA over the last few\nyears. A major accomplishment has been the enactment of the EPL, which together with\nrelevant environmental provisions in the laws on electricity, roads, land, water resources and\nforests, provides a relatively sound basis for environmental management in the country. The\nnext phase in pursuing environmental conservation and ensuring effective enforcement of the\nEPL  will  require  the  adoption  of  an  enabling  framework  for  regulation  and  compliance,\nsupported by measures to enhance Government capacity and address financial and institutional\nsustainability. Without such a framework, the adequate integration of environmental and social\nissues across all sectors will remain elusive.", "18\n62. Lack of an adequate framework for policy implementation is especially evident in major\nenergy and transport infrastructure development. The projects, which can have wide-ranging,\ncross-sectoral, and long-term social and environmental impacts, have often lacked effective\nplanning,  design,  and  implementation  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  Improved\nenvironmental  performance  in  these  sectors  will  require  overcoming  five  related  sets  of\nconstraints: (i) incomplete policy and regulatory framework at the national level; (ii) lack of policy\nimplementation  and  institutional  capacity  at  sectoral  and  provincial  levels;  (iii)  inadequate\ncompliance  and  enforcement  mechanisms;  (iv)  absence  of  integrated  area-based  planning\nframeworks to guide investments in energy and transport, and provide a strategic framework for\nreconciling  competing  interests  in  the  use  of  resources;  and  (v)  insufficient  attention  to\nsustainable financing for environmental management and social safeguards.\n63. The Government wants to make a transition from essentially reactive and case-by-case\nremedial  action  on  environmental  and  social  impacts  toward  a  proactive  approach  that\nintegrates these concerns at national, sectoral, and area-based levels. The Government has\nsought ADB's assistance to undertake a program of policy implementation measures that will\nshift  the  country  on  a  more  sustainable  development  trajectory,  beginning  with  actions  to\naddress identified constraints facing the energy and transport sectors. ADB has had a long and\nextensive association with these sectors as well as environmental management in the Lao PDR\nand has been able to gain relevant sector knowledge to pursue substantive policy dialogue with\nthe Government in this regard. The Program will assist the Government to implement the\nnecessary  preconditions  for  improved  environmental  management  and  social  safeguard\nperformance. While the Program will focus primarily on energy and transport, the policy shifts\nwill have beneficial effects beyond these sectors.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n64. The proposed Program will assist the Lao PDR to implement a targeted policy reform\nagenda for environmental management and social safeguards in the energy and transport\nsectors,  with  particular  focus  on  hydropower  and  roads.  The  Program  encompasses  five\nmutually  reinforcing  policy  objectives:  (i)  strengthening  national  policy  and  a  regulatory\nframework for environmental management and social safeguards, (ii) undertaking measures to\nenhance policy implementation and capacity at sectoral and provincial levels, (iii) improving\ncompliance and enforcement, (iv) promoting river basin management as a multisectoral and\nintegrated  planning  framework  for  energy  and  transport  development,  and  (v)  establishing\nsustainable financing mechanisms, including an environment fund.\n65. The program framework is in Appendix 3. The Government's intention to implement the\nProgram is summarized in the draft development policy letter shown in Appendix 4. The scope\nof the proposed reforms, the specific policy actions, and their sequencing are detailed in the\npolicy matrix shown in Appendix 5. The Government is committed to undertake these policy\nactions as an integral part of the Program.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions\n66. The policy framework and the specific actions included in the Program have been\ndesigned through a participatory process that involved field surveys, workshops, and extensive\nconsultations with stakeholders at the national, regional, and local levels, including the major\nfunding agencies involved in supporting environment, transport, and energy (Appendix 6). As a\nresult, the  reforms  and  specific  policy  actions  detailed  in  the  draft  policy matrix are directly", "19\nsupportive of the Government's environment and development objectives, and are intended to\ncomplement and actively promote relevant programs of the international aid community in the\nLao PDR.\n67. In view of the linkages across sectors and their bearing on environmental management\nand social safeguards in energy and transport development, a multisectoral approach was used\nto identify and develop the intended policy measures. In developing the policy matrix, it was\nrecognized that the process of strengthening policy implementation will extend beyond the time\nhorizon of the Program. Current capacity to implement the policy agenda is limited and can only\nimprove progressively in the short term to medium term. As such, the policy matrix reflects an\nincremental approach that is consistent with the realities of implementation capacity in the\ncountry.\n1.  National Policy and Regulatory Framework\n68. The EPL and relevant provisions of the laws on electricity, roads, forestry, and water\nresources provide an overall legal framework to protect environmental resources in the Lao\nPDR and safeguard the rights of affected people. Effective implementation and enforcement of\nthese laws are predicated on the development of appropriate regulatory frameworks. The EPL\ncannot achieve its full operational significance in the absence of implementing decrees and\nregulations that clarify roles, mandates, responsibilities, and operational measures. Recognizing\nthe  urgency  of  an  implementing  decree  for  the  EPL  that  will  underpin  the  Program,  the\nGovernment took action to issue this on 4 June 2001. In addition, national EIA regulations\nissued by STEA in October 2000 need to be updated to place greater emphasis on mechanisms\nfor public involvement in the EIA process. The revised regulations will be issued as a Prime\nMinister's decree to demonstrate political commitment and to ensure the regulations carry the\nnecessary  administrative  weight  to  facilitate  adoption  and  governance  of  sectoral  EIA\nregulations and the environmental certification process. Similarly, as an essential element in\nmeeting program objectives, the Government will take steps to ensure that the overall public\ninvestment plan (PIP) adequately addresses environmental management and social safeguard\nconcerns. The coverage will be reflected in the decree on preparing and monitoring the PIP,\ncurrently being developed with ADB assistance. Overall progress in addressing the environment\nwill be captured in annual state-of-the-environment reports to be issued by STEA, for which it is\nreceiving support from UNEP.\n69. A comprehensive policy on resettlement and compensation is required to provide a\nframework for effectively addressing the resettlement impacts of major projects (Appendix 7).\nAs another essential element of the Program, the adoption of the policy will provide a single\nnationwide standard applicable to all major projects that will meet both national objectives and\ninternational standards. The policy will consist of (i) an outline of the legal framework; (ii)\nprinciples  that  address  vulnerable  groups,  and  public  consultations  and  participation;  (iii)\nprinciples, rights, obligations, and entitlements for compensation; (iv) financial resources and\nbudgetary  issues;  (v)  management  of  resettlement  in  terms  of  the  institutional  and\nadministrative setup; and (vi) steps for policy implementation. Accompanying regulations will\nconsist of requirements for statistical data collection, contents of the implementation schedule,\ndispute resolution mechanisms, and provisions for monitoring.\n70. While the principles of public involvement and participation are enshrined in a number of\nGovernment  policies,  laws,  and  sector  strategies,  no  clear  national  policy  provides  the\nframework  and  standards  for  the  conduct  of  public  consultations  to  promote  participation,\ntransparency, and accountability. In the absence of such a policy framework, projects and", "20\ninterventions  sometimes  may  have  been  developed  and  implemented  without  adequate\nconsultations and participation of beneficiaries and affected communities. In keeping with the\nGovernment's commitment to participatory planning that caters to people's needs, priorities, and\naspirations, the Government will issue a policy statement and guidelines on public involvement\nand  participation  that  provide  for  planning,  facilitating,  and  monitoring  the  involvement  of\naffected communities in the preparation and implementation of major projects.\n71. STEA is responsible for interministerial coordination among line agencies concerned\nwith environmental protection. It has been doing this to a limited extent through the informal\nefforts of the IMWGE set up with the assistance of the UNDP. While the IMWGE has been a\nuseful body in the early stages of environmental policy formulation, it suffers from a dichotomy\nbecause it has an essentially technical membership but faces increasingly policy-based issues\nin  interministerial  coordination.  The  Government  is  committed  to  formally  establishing  a\npermanent  high-level  Environmental  Coordinating  Committee  (ECC)  to  address  policy-level\nissues and reconcile competing interests in the use of environment and natural resources. The\nGovernment envisages that the ECC will be serviced by working groups on technical issues.\n72. Over the medium term, the institutional architecture for environmental management may\nneed to evolve to reflect the complex challenges and cross-sectoral linkages facing the Lao\nPDR in managing land, water, and forest resources, biodiversity protection, environmentally\nsustainable agriculture and rural development, and urban environmental improvement. The\nroles of STEA and line ministries, both at national and subnational levels, will need to continue\nto respond to these challenges and the Government's decentralization strategy. As an integral\npart of the Program, the Government plans to review current institutional arrangements to\ndetermine  whether  adjustments  are  warranted  in  institutional  mandates,  structures,  and\nrelationships, and to assess long-term institutional development needs. The ECC will coordinate\nthe review, whose recommendations will be adopted during the Program. The Government will\nundertake a parallel review of provisions of relevant laws and decrees to clarify ambiguities and\ninconsistencies with the EPL and its implementing regulations.\n73. As evidenced by the most recent funding agency roundtable meeting (RTM) in 2000, the\nGovernment is taking steps to improve aid coordination and consultation for key development\nsectors.  STEA  will  establish  a  mechanism  for  regular  funding  agency  consultation  on\nenvironmental issues to facilitate exchange of information and sharing of knowledge, update\nfunding agencies on the progress of ongoing or planned projects, and discuss constraints and\nopportunities for improved implementation of the EPL and the NEAP across all sectors. STEA\nwill also establish a forum for civil society consultation to open a window for regular dialogue on\nemerging policy or project issues with all stakeholders.\n2.  Policy Implementation at Sector and Provincial Levels\n74. Environmental management in the Lao PDR needs to be better integrated into sectoral\ndevelopment strategies, programs and projects. The required policy integration can occur only if\nline ministries take a more active role in ensuring that environment and social measures are\nfully reflected in their work. Within the framework of the EPL and its implementing decree, line\nministries  are  required  to  issue  sectoral  EIA  regulations  and  establish  environmental\nmanagement and monitoring units.\n75. Under the Program, the Government intends to take a number of steps to strengthen\nsectoral performance, building on analysis and products  prepared  under  ADB TA (footnote 1).", "21\nMIH and MCTPC will issue implementing regulations on the EIA process, and formally adopt\ntechnical EIA guidelines for the energy and roads sectors, respectively. Both sets of regulations\nwill stipulate that the relevant ministry and STEA must approve the environmental management\nplan before an environmental certificate can be issued. MCTPC and MIH will also develop and\nissue  regulations  and  guidelines  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  compensation  for  major\nprojects. Within MIH and MCTPC, DOE and DOR will be restructured to upgrade the existing\nenvironmental management units to fully functioning social and environmental management\ndivisions reporting directly to the respective directors of DOE and DOR. Mandate, budget, terms\nof reference, staffing, and training programs for both divisions will be developed to meet the\nneed for improved environmental management and social safeguards. A similar process of\ninstitutional strengthening will be undertaken at EdL.\n76. In addition to strengthening the review and monitoring functions of DOE and DOR, the\nconcerned ministries will issue binding environmental and social safeguard codes of practice\ndirected at contractors and works supervisors, together with practical instructions. Under the\nProgram, the Government will explore the scope for introducing selected market arrangements\nto secure efficiency gains. This will include assessing the feasibility of contracting to the private\nsector  certain  environmental  management  and  social  safeguard  review,  monitoring,  and\nimplementation  functions.  The  assessment  will  involve  market  analysis  of  private  sector\ncapacity to implement selected environmental services for the Government under contract,\nincluding examination of certification, licensing, regulation, and incentives. It will also look at\nhow the private sector by giving on-the-ground training during contracted review and monitoring\nexercises, can build capacity in STEA and the environmental units of line agencies.\n77. In the context of the Government's decentralization strategy, increasing emphasis is\nbeing  given  to  building  relevant  capacity  at  provincial  and  district  levels,  and  defining\nappropriate linkages among line agencies. The EPL assigns a significant role to provincial and\ndistrict STEOs in ensuring that environment objectives are reflected in provincial and district\ndevelopment  planning,  and  that  environmental  provisions  are  complied  with  and  enforced.\nDecentralization will take some time to become effective because existing capacities are weak\nand will remain inadequate in the medium term. Nevertheless, the Program will ensure that\nnecessary steps are taken to strengthen and equip STEOs, beginning in a limited number of\nprovinces\u2014at least seven\u2014 within the period of the Program. In these provinces, the respective\nSTEOs  will  coordinate  the  preparation  of  environment  action  plans  to  provide  a  basis  for\nprioritizing tasks, allocating Government resources, and budgeting purposes. The environment\naction plans will be updated periodically and reflected in provincial development plans and\nbudgets. The overall process will be supported by TA from bilateral sources already committed\nto assisting the Government in this area.17\n78. The Program will also lay the foundations for longer term and more comprehensive\nstrengthening of provincial STEOs. In this regard, STEA will prepare and submit to the Cabinet\na detailed assessment and realistic recommendations on priority medium-term human and\nfinancial resource requirements to effectively implement the EPL at provincial and district levels.\nIn undertaking the assessment, STEA will also review and implement improvements in the\nfunctional linkages between STEA and provincial STEOs.\n                                                \n17 A Swedish-funded project based at the Science, Technology, and Environment Agency (STEA), which started\nimplementation in early 2001, will include support for STEA and at least four science, technology, and environment\noffices (STEOs), and a second phase of a Danish-funded project at Committee for Planning and Cooperation will\ninclude support for a number of STEOs.", "22\n3.  Compliance and Enforcement\n79. The Program as a whole is concerned with improved implementation, compliance, and\nenforcement of the EPL and related regulations. At the same time, a number of specific policy\nactions are envisaged to further promote compliance and enforcement, and to ensure that\ncompliance is subject to independent and transparent review when this is appropriate. To\nsupport transparency and accountability in social and environmental decision making, STEA will\nmaintain  an  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  register  and  establish  a  fully\nfunctioning public information center, which will catalogue and make available to the public\ncopies of all EIAs, environment management plans (EMPs), and resettlement action plans\n(RAPs) submitted and approved. An environmental gazette will be published twice yearly. The\ngazette will record notices related to environment clearance certificates, licenses, decisions on\napprovals  and  required  mitigation  actions  for  development  projects,  enforcement  actions\nagainst  industrial  and  mining  polluters.  The  gazette  will  list  projects  related  to  social  and\nenvironmental management. STEA, in close consultation with the ECC, will prepare a strategy\nfor initiating and producing the environmental gazette. STEA will be responsible for managing\nits twice yearly publication on a continuous basis. Information to be disclosed in the gazette will\nbe provided by Government agencies, coordinated by STEA.\n80. MIH  and  MCTPC  will  prepare  annual  sector  reports  on  social  and  environmental\nperformance and compliance and submit them to STEA and the ECC. The sector compliance\nreports will cover (i) environment certificate conditions included in concession agreements,\nlicenses, permits, tenders, and bidding documents; (ii) state of compliance with the EPL and\nproject-specific EMPs as well as RAPs; and (iii) implementation plan and budget for addressing\nany identified deficiencies. Other ministries will also be encouraged to submit such reports, on\nthe  basis  of  experience  gained  at  MIH  and  MCTPC.  MIH  and  MCTPC  will  also  institute\nprocedures to ensure that the social and environmental mitigation programs and associated\nbudgets as shown in the EMPs, special assistance projects, and involuntary resettlement action\nplans are properly incorporated into project concession agreements, financial arrangements,\nand other relevant contractual documents.\n81. The need both to comply and to be seen to comply with EMPs and RAPs is especially\nimportant for successful implementation of transport and energy projects. The Government has\nhad a generally positive experience with third-party monitoring, which it has employed for three\nmajor hydropower and road infrastructure projects. Third-party monitoring is also important in\nproviding  comfort  to  investors  and  funding  agencies  that  funding  provided  for  major\ninfrastructure  projects  will  result  in  socially  and  environmentally  acceptable  outcomes.  As\nenvisaged  under  the  Program,  a  third-party  monitoring  system  will  be  designed  and\ninstitutionalized  to  ensure  technically  competent,  transparent,  and  independent  compliance\nmonitoring of all complex and sensitive infrastructure projects. The design of the third-party\nmonitoring system will place emphasis on mentoring approaches to build national capacities for\nmainstream monitoring. STEA will be responsible for organizing the basic framework for the\nthird-party monitoring system in close conjunction with relevant line agencies. The Government\nhas decided that the third-party monitoring system will be put in place in the course of program\nimplementation for all sensitive and complex projects, beginning with all hydropower projects\nand those roads projects that may impact negatively on protected areas or involve significant\ninvoluntary resettlement.\n82. As  part  of  the  Program,  the  Government  will  test  arrangements  to  strengthen\nperformance  bond  systems   to   provide  a   means  of   enforcing   developer   and  contractor", "23\ncommitments  and  obligations  on  environmental  and  social  mitigation,  and  to  improve  the\nincentive structure for compliance. Such performance bonds financially guarantee meeting the\ncosts of such mitigation, or will be called upon in the event of noncompliance. Potential activities\nfor which a bond could apply include resettlement and compensation, environmental mitigation\nworks,  monitoring,  and  decommissioning.  The  bonds  will  be  targeted  to  specific  activities\nidentified in the project EMP and RAP, and will apply to developers of major sensitive projects.\nA number of issues will be addressed on a case-by-case basis such as (i) the form of security,\nits irrevocable nature, and the appropriate level of financial assurance; (ii) the triggers for\nrelease of the bond; and (iii) arrangements for holding the bond. The Government will apply the\nrecommendations of its study of these options to configure and implement the performance\nbond system.\n83. A crucial element in ensuring compliance with environmental rules and regulations is\npublic knowledge of rights and responsibilities. Building on previous efforts to inform the public\nabout the EPL at national, provincial, and district levels, STEA will launch and conduct together\nwith relevant ministries an ongoing national public awareness campaign. The campaign will\ninvolve the media, educational institutions, and mass organizations such as Lao Women's\nUnion in raising awareness of environmental management and social safeguards, and the\nprovisions of the public involvement policy. STEA is already receiving support from bilateral aid\nagencies to expand this process and ensure systematic coverage across provincial and district\nlevels.\n84. The Government will also pursue capacity strengthening in the field of administration\nand justice, with support from bilateral aid agencies. The activities will include (i) an overview of\nlegal  mandates  and  implications  of  the  EPL;  (ii)  legal  approaches  to  enforcement  and\ncompliance; and (iii) civil and criminal sanctions, such as warnings, fines, civil sanctions, and\ncriminal charges. Specialized training workshops will be held for members of the judiciary, legal\nofficials  in  the  National  Assembly,  Prime  Minister's  Office,  Ministry  of  Justice,  Public\nProsecutor's Office, and faculty of the National University Law School.\n4.  Integrated Framework for Resource Management\n85. The Program includes a number of policy actions to ensure that planning of energy and\nroads programs can take place within an integrated resource management framework. The\nGovernment has issued on 10 October 2001 a decree to implement the Water and Water\nResources Law, and establish river basin planning as the overall framework for natural resource\nmanagement. The decree, which was developed with ADB assistance and has undergone\nconsiderable consultations through the WRCC mechanism, will define the structure of water\nresources planning and management at the national and river basin levels. At the national level,\na National Water Resources Plan (NWRP) will define the national objectives, strategies, and\npriorities for water resources development and management, including institutional issues. At\nthe level of at least one major river basin, plans will be produced to address (i) assessment of\nthe  resources  available  and  obligations  to  downstream  areas,  (ii)  allocation  of  water  to\nsubsectors, (iii) declaration of preserved and reserved areas, (iv) controls for managing water\nquality, and (v) institutional arrangements and coordination responsibilities.\n86. Within the overall river basin management approach, MAF will take necessary actions\nas adopted under the Nam Ngum river basin action agenda and management strategy. It will\nalso  finalize  and  begin  to  implement  a  master  plan  to  promote  watershed  management\nactivities and  prepare  integrated  frameworks  for  area-based  planning. Within  the  integrated", "24\nplanning context, MIH and MCTPC, in close consultation with other relevant agencies, will\nreview their medium-term sector plans to identify strategic environmental management and\nsocial safeguard issues. As a support measure, the Government wishes to develop an improved\nsystem  for  interministerial  data  collection,  access,  and  use  to  assist  in  planning  and\nimplementing projects with an integrated resource management approach. The process will be\nguided by the following principles: (i) a framework for the information system will be developed\nand agreed to by the ECC, and (ii) the data collection and storage system will preserve the\nintegrity of existing databases. Finally, the preparation of the National Biodiversity Conservation\nStrategy and Action Plan (NBCSAP) is linked to the long-term success of the Program, in view\nof the need to ensure that priority biodiversity conservation objectives are properly articulated\nand taken into account in national and sector development planning. To formulate the NBCSAP,\nthe  Government  has  secured  financial  support  and  technical  assistance  from  the  Danish\nInternational Development Assistance (Danida).\n5.  Sustainable Financing Mechanisms\n87. To achieve its ambitious socioeconomic development targets, the Government intends\nto (i) increase budget revenue as a percentage of GDP; (ii) mobilize private investment in\nproviding  public  services  and  infrastructure;  (iii)  ensure  that  public  expenditure  is  directed\nefficiently  to  investments  that  maximize  long-term  social  and  economic  returns;  and  (iv)\nincrease the share of current expenditure in total public expenditure. A core program focus is to\nsupport  Government  efforts  to  attract  increased  private  investment  in  socially  and\nenvironmentally responsible hydropower development, and transport, trade, and tourism-related\nactivities.  These  sectors  have  the  potential  to  generate  substantial  improvements  in\nGovernment revenue.\n88. The Program will benefit from actions to finalize a joint Government-ADB-IMF-World\nBank  public  expenditure  review  (PER)  of  plans  and  implementation  and  monitoring\nmechanisms, and to implement agreed-upon actions resulting from the PER as they relate to\nProgram objectives. The Program includes measures to strengthen public investment planning\nprocesses and to ensure that the overall PIP is formulated and monitored in compliance with the\nEPL. Policy actions will be initiated to develop reporting systems to provide information on\nconsolidated national spending on the environment to be published by MOF. Other measures\nrelated to increased transparency, public consultation processes, compliance reporting, and\nthird-party monitoring of investments in the transport and energy sectors will contribute to\nincreased  public  expenditure  accountability  and,  thus,  to  increased  public  expenditure\nefficiency. Counterpart funds generated from the program loan will be used to fund increased\nallocations of current expenditure in total public expenditure.\n89. Effective  implementation  of  environmental  and  social  measures  in  the  energy  and\ntransport  sectors  will  benefit  from  a  sustainable  financing  mechanism  to  provide  targeted\nsupport over the long term. As an integral part of the Program, and as foreseen under the EPL,\nthe Government will establish an environment fund to respond to this need. The proceeds of the\nfund will be used to finance appropriate entities that would undertake these activities in the Lao\nPDR: (i) capacity building and human resource development for environmental management\nand social safeguards; (ii) third-party monitoring of environmental and social implications of\ncomplex and sensitive infrastructure projects; (iii) planning frameworks for integrated resource\nmanagement; (iv) conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; (v) participatory natural\nresource management initiatives; and (vi) enabling measures to ensure that environmental and", "25\nsocial  mitigation  in  energy,  transport,  and  other  infrastructure  projects  is  in  place  and\nimplemented.\n90. In consultation with ADB, the Government has decided on the basic principles that will\ngovern the design and operations of the fund (Appendix 8). The fund\u2019s final design, size,\ngovernance structure, and operating mechanisms will be based on an extensive consultation\nprocess, and will be consistent with international best practice and experience with environment\nfunds.  The  fund  will  be  tailored  to  reflect  the  country\u2019s  basic  fabric  of  legal  and  financial\npractices, including supporting institutions such as banking, auditing, and contracting, and the\ncapacity to implement the environmental and social mitigation measures envisaged. It will be\nconfigured to ensure a sustained flow of income over its life span. ADB TA is being processed\nin parallel to the Program to assist the Government in reviewing options and configuring the\nFund (footnote 14).\n91. The Government also believes it would be desirable to implement the recovery of costs\nof enforcing the environmental and social mitigation regulations. The imposition of user charges\ncould contribute to realizing equity and sustainability objectives. The Government will make a\nstudy to identify appropriate services for which user charges could be levied, and to assess the\nfeasibility of a user charge system. The study will analyze a range of options for imposing user\ncharges. The options will be prepared in consultation with relevant stakeholders.\nD. Program Adjustment Costs\n92. Program adjustment costs are estimated at about $37 million over a five-year period.\nThis indicative estimate is based on assumptions about (i) the incremental investment costs of\nimproved  compliance  with  stricter  environmental  and  social  safeguards  in  the  power  and\ntransport sectors, (ii) the costs of undertaking watershed planning and pilot projects to improve\nwatershed management, (iii) indicative estimates of direct institutional strengthening costs, and\n(iv) the initial capitalization of the environment fund.\n93. The major adjustment costs of the proposed program result from the additional public\ninvestment costs needed to ensure that environmental and social safeguards are built into\ninfrastructure projects. Incremental compliance costs for road transport development projects\nare estimated at 0.5-1.5 percent of total investment costs. The additional development costs\nresult from improved resettlement programs, increased public consultations and information\ndissemination,  social  and  environmental  expertise  in  contract  supervision  and  project\nmonitoring, unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance, and regenerating the construction areas.\nIncremental costs are higher for new and reconstructed roads than for rehabilitation of existing\nroads. Given the financing gaps in the transport sector investment plan and recent levels of\ninvestment, it is assumed that only 75 percent of the transport investment plan is actually\nimplemented. For the power sector, incremental compliance costs are estimated to be in the\norder of about 2 percent of total hydropower investment costs. The base case assumption is\nthat only 20 percent of planned IPP projects are actually developed in the next 10 years\n(excluding Nam Theun 2, which is expected to be implemented but with full compliance costs\nassumed  in  the  without-Program  situation).  Estimated  adjustment  costs  are  sensitive  to\nassumptions regarding development costs and the percentage of planned investment actually\nimplemented. Approximately half the infrastructure adjustment costs would be incurred under\npublicly financed projects (i.e., the roads and domestic power projects).", "26\n94. The Government will incur additional costs in implementing river basin and watershed\nmanagement  studies  and  pilot  projects.  The  MAF  draft  master  plan  for  its  watershed\nmanagement program estimates that $5.22 million will be required over the next five years for\nwatershed management planning and pilot activities, and $3.19 million for agro-zoning, land use\nplanning, and mapping in key watersheds. To implement new guidelines; to increase public\nawareness of rights and obligations with respect to social and environmental safeguards; to\neffectively address social and environmental issues in national, sectoral, river basin, provincial,\nand project planning exercises; and in third-party monitoring of sensitive infrastructure projects,\nthe Government plans to reorganize and strengthen the capacity of Government agencies at\ncentral and provincial levels. Adjustment costs will also be incurred in implementing systematic\nstakeholder consultations in sector and public investment planning. Summary estimates of\nprogram adjustment costs over a medium-term horizon of five years are presented in Table 1.\nTable 1: Indicative Program Adjustment Costs (Over 5 years)\nItem Costs ($ million)\nInfrastructure 20.56\n  Public Investment in Road Transport 4.96\n    - Rehabilitation projects 0.17\n    - Strategic projects 3.57\n    - Local projects 0.83\n    - Mekong bridges 0.25\n    - Vientiane City 0.14\n  Public Investment in Domestic Power 5.60\n    - Domestic generation 4.20\n    - Domestic transmission 0.80\n    - Domestic distribution 0.60\n  Export Power (IPP) 10.00\nIntegrated Area-Based Planning/Management 8.41\n   Watershed management 5.22\n   Land use planning 3.19\nInstitutional Strengthening 2.46\n  STEA and investment planning 0.70\n  DOR/MCTPC 0.36\n  DOE/MIH 0.05\n  EdL 0.14\n  STEOs 1.21\nEnvironment Fund 5.25\n   Fund 5.00\n   Counterpart costs of studies 0.25\nTotal 36.68\nDOE = Department of Electricity, DOR = Department of Roads, EdL = Electricit\u00e9 du Lao,\nIPP = independent power producer, MCTPC = Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction,\nMIH = Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts, STEA = Science, Technology, and Environment Agency,\nSTEOs = science, technology, and environment offices.", "27\nVI.  THE PROPOSED LOAN\nA. Amount of Loan, Source of Funds, Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n95. The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $20 million from ADB\u2019s Special\nFunds resources. The amount was determined through ADB\u2019s continued dialogue with the\nGovernment. It takes into account the depth and scope of the proposed policy reforms, and the\nestimated short- and medium-term adjustment costs associated with adopting the policy matrix.\nThe Borrower will be the Lao PDR. The loan will have a repayment period of 24 years, including\na grace period of 8 years. An interest rate of 1 percent per annum interest will be charged\nduring the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The loan is expected to be\nutilized over 36 months from loan effectiveness.\nB.  Implementation Arrangements\n \n 96. STEA will be the Executing Agency for the Program, in close coordination with CPC,\nMOF, MCTPC, MIH, and MAF. STEA will have overall responsibility for ensuring effective\nimplementation  of  the  Program,  and  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports.  MOF  will  be\nresponsible  for  monitoring  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds,  including  the\nadministration and disbursement of the loan proceeds and maintenance of accounts.\n \n 97. An  interministerial  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  president  of  STEA,  will  be\nestablished to oversee program implementation. It will be composed of representatives of CPC,\nMAF, MCTPC, MIH, MOF, and STEA. It will meet quarterly and also in conjunction with ADB\nreview missions.\n \nC.  Procurement\n \n 98. The loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs, excluding local duties and taxes, of\nimports procured in and from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the list of\nineligible items (Appendix 9) and those items financed by other multilateral and bilateral official\nsources. Procurement of eligible items under ADB\u2019s loan will be based on normal commercial\npractices  for  procurement  by  the  private  sector,  or  standard  Government  procurement\nprocedures acceptable to ADB for procurement by the public sector. In the case of goods\ncommonly traded on international commodity markets, procurement will be done in accordance\nwith procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. ADB will ensure that standard\npublic and private sector procurement procedures used in the country are adequate in the\ninterest of economy and efficiency.\n \nD.  Disbursement\n 99. Loan proceeds will be utilized to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced in\nand procured from ADB\u2019s member countries (other than those items specified in Appendix 9\nand imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources). The loan utilization period will\nbe 36 months after loan effectiveness. On the basis of ADB\u2019s simplified procedures for the\ndisbursement of program loans,18 the Borrower will be required to submit with each withdrawal\nrequest a certification confirming the Borrower\u2019s compliance with the following formula for the\nperiod covered by the withdrawal request: for each year in which the proceeds are expected to\nbe  disbursed,  the  value  of  the  country\u2019s  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember\n                                                \n 18 R50-98: Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, 16 April 1998.", "28\ncountries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed under other ODA. This must be equal\nto or greater than the amounts expected to be disbursed during the year. The Government will\nopen an account (the deposit account) at the Bank of Lao PDR into which part of the proceeds\nof the loan from the first and second tranches will be deposited and through which  withdrawals\nwill be made. Monthly statements of the deposit account will be attached to the quarterly reports\nof STEA. The balance of the loan proceeds under the third tranche will be used to capitalize the\nproposed environment fund. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to\nverify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\n \nE.  Counterpart Funds\n 100. The  Government  will  use  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  loan  to  (i)  finance\nadditional public investment costs in transport and power projects to ensure strengthened social\nand  environmental  safeguards;  (ii)  build  institutional  capacity  to  plan,  design,  and  enforce\nenvironmental and social safeguards; (iii) provide local counterpart resources for development\nprojects aimed at river basin planning and management, and area-based planning; (iv) address\nthe mitigation costs of existing infrastructure where social and environmental costs were not\nadequately addressed; and (v) capitalize the environment fund.\n \nF.  Tranching and Monitoring\n101. The proceeds of ADB's loan will be released in three tranches when ADB is assured that\nthe  conditions  for  their  release  are  satisfied.  The  first  tranche  of  $5  million  will  be  made\navailable upon loan effectiveness. It is envisaged that the second tranche of $10 million will be\ndisbursed  within  14  months  after  the  first  tranche  release,  subject  to  the  Government's\ncompliance with the conditions set for the release of the second tranche. A third tranche of $5\nmillion will be used to finance the environment fund when it is established during the 36-month\nperiod of loan utilization. The policy matrix (Appendix 5) lists the conditions for the release of\neach tranche. The compliance requirements for each policy condition are detailed in Appendix\n10.\n102. Program implementation will be monitored closely by the Government and by ADB\nthrough its regular loan review missions. Program performance indicators are included in the\nprogram framework (Appendix 3). ADB monitoring of the Program will go beyond monitoring\ncompliance with tranche conditions and other actions included in the policy matrix, to deepen\nand sustain the dialogue with the Government on the overall effectiveness of the Program in\nimproving  environmental  and  social  safeguards  while  developing  the  transport  and  energy\ninfrastructure.  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  reports  on  program\nimplementation, particularly on policy actions set out in the policy matrix and development policy\nletter, as well as on the achievement of the program objectives. The reports will be submitted in\nsuch form and in such detail and within such period as ADB may request, and must include\nprogress made and problems encountered during the three months in review, steps taken or\nproposed to be taken to remedy problems encountered, and the proposed detailed activity for\nprogram implementation and expected progress during the next three months. A joint ADB-\nGovernment midterm policy review will be undertaken before the second tranche is released,\nand will cover the relevance and effectiveness of the policy actions as well as compliance. On\ncompletion of the Program, but in any event not later than six months, the Government will\nprepare and submit to ADB a comprehensive report on the overall impact of the policy reforms\nimplemented.", "29\nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Impacts and Benefits\n103. The Program will strengthen the policy and regulatory framework for environmental\nmanagement and social safeguards; enhance institutional capacity at sectoral and provincial\nlevels to identify, analyze, and address social and environmental issues; bolster compliance\nwith  and  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations;  foster  improved  sector  planning  within  an\nintegrated  natural  resource  management  framework;  and  promote  sustained  financing  for\npriority environmental management activities.\n104. The  Program  will  reduce  or  avoid  the  high  social  and  environmental  costs  of\ninappropriately designed infrastructure development in the energy and transport sectors. This\nwill result from the strategic environment assessment at the level of the PIP, improved upstream\nplanning of sectoral development and reconciliation of competing uses of natural resources\nwithin a river basin context, better policy integration across the sectors, and more systematic\nattention to environmental and social safeguards in project preparation and implementation.\nStricter enforcement, combined with incentives for compliance such as performance bonds, will\nfacilitate  internalization  of  externalities.  Recent  analysis  shows  that  the  actual  costs  of\nresettlement can be 5-10 times higher than the amounts provided by developers. Where social\nand environmental costs cannot be avoided, more equitable distribution of these costs will result\nfrom inclusion of appropriate mitigation measures in project design. This will help ensure that\nsocial and environmental costs will be borne, not by the local communities but by the project\ndevelopers.\n105. Introducing a coherent and more transparent regulatory framework for addressing social\nand environmental concerns will reduce uncertainty and delays associated with investment in\nlarge infrastructure projects in the Lao PDR. This in turn will help make projects more attractive\nto potential investors. It will also provide an enabling environment for international investors with\nglobal  reputations  to  protect.  Such  investors  will  often  prefer  a  regulatory  framework  that\nensures that environmental and social mitigation activities can be planned and implemented in a\npredictable manner, with clear definition of the rights and obligations of all partners.\n106. Implementing public participation guidelines will substantially improve the identification\nof potential environmental and social issues associated with infrastructure developments, and\nthe design of appropriate measures to address these concerns. Improved public participation\nwill also generate additional economic benefits by (i) creating a better understanding of local\nconditions, which will facilitate improved project designs, reduce risks, and increase efficiency;\n(ii) identifying opportunities to maximize economic benefits from infrastructure developments;\n(iii) enhancing a sense of ownership and sustainability of new infrastructure; and (iv) increasing\nthe accountability of developers and contractors.\n107. The Program will enhance prospects for adequate and sustained allocation of resources\nfor  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards  by  introducing  of  user  fees  for\nenvironmental services and establishing the environment fund. It will also increase the efficiency\nof resource use through prioritization and improved budgetary processes that properly reflect\nthe  requirements  of  sectoral  and  provincial  agencies  concerned  with  environmental\nmanagement and the implementation of social safeguards.", "30\n108. Thus,  program  benefits  include  (i)  reducing  the  environmental  and  social  costs  of\nprojects  developed  with  inappropriate  safeguards;  (ii)  increasing  equity  and  resource  use\nefficiency by internalizing social and environmental considerations in sector development; (iii)\nreducing the costs associated with \u201cfixing\u201d environmental and social problems resulting from an\ninadequate regulatory framework and weak enforcement of safeguards; (iv) attracting increased\ncommercial investment in infrastructure development; and (v) ensuring more sustainable and\nless risky project designs that better reflect local concerns, needs, and opportunities.\n109. The Program will also contribute to the country's poverty reduction goals. Improved\nenvironmental management will help maintain and enhance the livelihood base of the rural\npoor. Land use planning and watershed management will improve prospects for sustainable use\nof  natural  resources.  Road  transport  developed,  conceived  within  an  area-based  planning\nframework, will directly benefit isolated communities by improving market linkages and access\nto services. Over the medium term, it is expected that revenues from hydropower projects will\nalso allow the government to increase the share of public expenditure allocated to health,\neducation,  and  social  development.  Introducing  of  social  safeguards  in  infrastructure\ndevelopment  will  ensure  that  vulnerable  groups  are  not  impoverished  or  marginalized  by\nadverse impacts.\n110. Finally, the proceeds of the program loan will allow the Government to temporarily\nincrease current expenditure to correct the existing imbalance between current and capital\nexpenditure  and  this,  combined  with  program  expenditure  reforms,  will  help  increase  and\nensure more sustainable returns on public investment.\nB. Risks and Safeguards\n111. A strong political will and commitment are essential to effective program implementation.\nMore immediate economic and social problems, such as the reemergence of regional and\ndomestic  economic  instability,  could  divert  policy  makers\u2019  attention  from  the  commitment\nneeded to enforce improved social and environmental safeguards. ADB experience with earlier\nprogram loans to the Lao PDR indicates that it can be difficult to sustain commitments to\nagreed-upon measures as new priorities emerge. However, ADB\u2019s experience in financing\nenergy and transport projects has also shown that social, economic, and environmental risks\nwill continue to be the subject of high-profile attention among both national and international\nstakeholders. Sustained and regular dialogue, solid analysis of the longer term benefits of social\nsafeguards and environmental management, consultative mechanisms with funding agencies\nand civil society, and public awareness raising are built into the program design to help maintain\npolitical commitment and to reduce the risk of ineffective implementation. ADB and Government\nmonitoring of the Program needs to extend beyond routine monitoring to entail an ongoing\nprocess of assessment to ensure the continued relevance and effectiveness of program actions.\n112. There are no blueprints for developing appropriate policies and institutions to effectively\ndesign and enforce environmental and social safeguards for energy and transport development.\nInstruments and best practices are evolving and need to be adapted to local conditions and\nconstraints. In addition, it can be expected that weak institutional capacity and limited human\nresources in the Lao PDR will handicap efforts to properly address environmental and social\nimpacts. Against this backdrop, the Program reflects an incremental approach that is tailored to\nthe  realities of limited implementation capacity, and  the  need  to  introduce  policy reforms in a", "31\nstructured and sequential fashion. The Program builds on substantial TA that has laid the\ngroundwork for the policy reforms and built the capacity to implement them. The Program will\nalso benefit from the ongoing TA (footnote 14) that will allow the Government to tailor policy\nresponses during implementation. The Program has been designed to combine both immediate\npolicy actions, where there is sufficient basis to proceed, and flexibility to progressively adapt\nand  expand  initiatives  in  response  to  increased  information,  implementation  lessons,  and\ninternational experiences. An example is the restructuring of environmental and social units\nwithin  sectoral  agencies  in  the  short  term,  supplemented  by  a  broader  review  of  overall\ninstitutional arrangements for environmental management during program implementation.\n113. Effective environmental management and rigorous enforcement of environmental and\nsocial safeguards will require the continued allocation of adequate resources across a wide\nspectrum  of  activities,  from  public  awareness  campaigns  to  community-based  resource\nmanagement  and  biodiversity  conservation,  as  well  as  to  more  specialized  social  and\nenvironmental regulatory functions in central, sectoral, and provincial government agencies. To\nminimize  the  risk  of  insufficient  resource  allocation,  the  Program  includes  measures  to\nstrengthen monitoring of compliance with social and environmental safeguards, studies on\nlonger term resource needs, priority setting within provincial environmental action plans, a range\nof  measures  and  mechanisms  aimed  at  ensuring  sustainable  finance  for  environmental\nmanagement  and  social  safeguards,  and  the  priority  allocation  of  counterpart  funds  for\nProgram-related activities. In addition, program measures to track environmental allocations in\nthe  annual  budgetary  process  will  allow  greater  transparency  and  will  facilitate  continued\ndialogue.\nVIII.  ASSURANCES\n114. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Unless  the  Government  and  ADB  state  otherwise,  the  policies  adopted  and\nactions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, as described in the\nGovernment\u2019s development policy letter (Appendix 4), will continue to remain in\neffect for at least two years beyond the program period.\n \n(ii)  Unless the Government and ADB state otherwise, the Government will adopt and\nimplement  other  agreed-upon  program  actions  specified  in  the  development\npolicy letter and policy matrix in a timely manner, and will sustain these initiatives\nat least two years beyond the program period.\n \n(iii)  The Government will actively assist and support ongoing program monitoring and\nevaluation,  including  facilitating  consultations  with  central  and  provincial\nagencies, civil society, and other key stakeholders as appropriate.\n \n(iv)  The Government will continue to dialogue with ADB on barriers to environmental\nmanagement and social safeguards and problems encountered during program\nimplementation.\n \n(v)  The Government will keep ADB informed of relevant policy discussions with\nother funding agencies and civil society about measures to ensure effective\nimplementation of environmental management and social safeguards.\n ", "32\n(vi)  The Government will give ADB the opportunity to comment on relevant studies\nand  draft  regulations  that  are  likely  to  impact  on  program  objectives  and\nimplementation.\n \n(vii)  The Government will continue to work with ADB to resolve environmental and\nsocial issues related to past and ongoing ADB investments in the transport and\nenergy sector.\n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that adequate and timely funds are available to\nrelevant  central  agencies  and  provincial  administrations  to  facilitate\nimplementation of the Program.\n \n(ix)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  on  any  matters  related  to  the\nestablishment of the environment fund.\nIX.  RECOMMENDATION\n115. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  15,648,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the\nEnvironment and Social Program, with a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years\nand with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\n         President\n12 November 2001", "33\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n     \n1  External Assistance to the Environment  34  14, 49\n2  Past Experiences and Lessons Learned  36  16, 57\n3  Program Framework  42  18, 65\n4  Development Policy Letter  47  18, 65\n5  Policy Matrix  52  18, 65\n6  Participatory Planning Processes  57  18, 66\n7  Involuntary Resettlement and Public Involvement  62  19, 69\n8  Principles for the Design and Establishment  66  25, 90\n of the Environment Fund\n9  Ineligible Items  67  27, 98\n10  Compliance Measures for Tranche Releases  68  28, 101\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\nA Program Adjustment Costs and Benefits\nB Environmental Assessment\nC Poverty and Social Impact Assessment", "34 Appendix 1, page 1\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ENVIRONMENT\nSource Type Title Amount Period\nA.

Overview and Summary\n1. Experience  in  implementing  transport  and  energy  projects  in  the  Lao  People's\nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) has demonstrated that, often, such projects have resulted in\nadverse  social  and  environmental  impacts  that  were  not  adequately  anticipated  during\nidentification and formulation or were inadequately addressed during project construction and\noperation. This has caused unnecessary environmental damage and human hardship, and has\nweakened investor and funding agency confidence. These problems have arisen because of (i)\nweak policy and regulatory mechanisms; (ii) inadequate attention to the environment and social\nissues in sector and project planning; (iii) inadequate involvement of civil society in planning,\nimplementation, and monitoring activities; (iv) weak enforcement of regulations and contract\nagreements  dealing  with  environmental  and  social  safeguards;  (v)  weak  capacity  of\nimplementation and monitoring agencies; and (vi) lack of sustainable financing mechanisms.\n2. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) experience with policy-based lending in the Lao\nPDR has been partly satisfactory. While there have been delays and some policy reversals,\nprogram  loans  have  helped  push  forward  important  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the\nagriculture and finance sectors. Among the key lessons from program lending to the Lao PDR\nare the need to (i) ensure country ownership of the program, (ii) provide clear analysis for the\nrationale for proposed policy reforms, (iii) allow adequate lead time for consultative processes\nbefore the issuance of new legislation and/or regulations and to directly address enforcement\nissues, (iv) correctly assess absorptive capacity and incorporate capacity building as an integral\npart of the program, (v) provide well-designed technical assistance to sustain policy dialogue,\n(vi) focus reform efforts on a manageable package of priority reforms that are critical to realizing\nprogram  objectives,  (vii)  sequence  and  integrate  reforms  within  the  national  development\nagenda, (viii) recognize limited national capacity to monitor program implementation, and (ix)\nestablish clear performance criteria to facilitate program monitoring. These lessons are reflected\nin the program design.\nB. Recent National Experiences in Transport and Energy Development\n1. Policy and Regulatory Mechanisms\n3. Because of past inadequacies in the policy, regulatory, and institutional framework,\nsocial safeguard and environmental management measures have been implemented in an ad\nhoc basis, mostly in response to the requirements of financial backers. Significant progress has\nbeen made in the last five years in establishing the foundations to address this problem, with\nthe National Assembly approving major legislation.\n4. Major regulatory gaps are in providing national directions for (i) involuntary resettlement\nand compensation, and (ii) procedures for public participation. Without such directions, local\ncommunities risk bearing the external environment and social costs of infrastructure projects.\nWhile  regulations  on  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  issued  by  the  president  of\nScience,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA)  provide  a  framework  for  improved\nenvironmental and social management, resettlement and public participation issues are not\naddressed. Experience suggests that enforcement will remain problematic until EIA regulations\nare issued with additional administrative weight of a Prime Minister's decree. Moreover, rapid\npromulgation of this new body of law has resulted in some overlap and inconsistencies. For\nexample, it is unclear who is responsible for compensating personal losses in road rights-of-way", "37 Appendix 2, page 2\nthrough forested areas. Sectoral laws need to be reviewed to ensure consistency with the\nEnvironment Protection Law (EPL) to avoid future delays and improve enforcement.\n5. Implementing guidelines have been drafted to provide direction on how to address social\nand environmental issues in the roads and hydropower sectors. Most have gone through an\nextensive  consultation  process,  but  have  not  yet  received  ministerial  approval.  Without\nministerial approval, environment staff will have to continue to seek clearance from higher\nauthorities  for  routine  operations,  resulting  in  continuing  inefficiencies  and  delays  in\nimplementing social and environmental programs.\n2. Sectoral Planning, Project Design, and Impact Assessment\na.  Integrated Area-Based Planning and Sectoral Planning\n6. Transport and energy developments have often taken place with inadequate account\ntaken of existing and planned developments, natural resource concentrations (e.g., biodiversity\nareas, water sources, mineral deposits, cultural sites), existing land use, and local institutional\ncapacity during infrastructure planning. This increases costs and causes that potential beneficial\nsynergies to be lost, reducing economic and financial returns. Efforts to minimize social and\nenvironmental impacts at the project level must begin at the time that sectoral strategies and\nprograms are being formulated (i.e., at project identification), when location and design changes\ncan take place at minimal cost. Addressing social and environmental concerns during energy\nsector planning can facilitate identification of least-cost options. This is crucial when significant\nresettlement may be required or when cumulative downstream impacts might affect major\nincome-generating activities such as agriculture, which will require significant compensation\ncosts. The recent Hydropower Development Strategy Study is a useful and precedent-setting\nstudy for the Lao PDR using this approach, but additional work is required.\nb.  Inconsistent Project-Level Social and Environmental Assessments\n7. The quality and implementation of social and environmental assessments have a major\nbearing on whether road or hydropower projects achieve their development goals. The quality of\nsocial and environmental impact assessments and resettlement plans vary greatly because of\ninadequate time, expertise, and limited funding. Presently, projects funded by bilateral and\nmultilateral sources generally require higher quality assessments, but even these assessments\nvary  greatly  in  quality.  With  the  promulgation  of  the  EPL,  and  the  planned  issuance  of\nregulations and other supporting instruments, all projects will be required to meet the same\nnational standards and undergo the same authorizing procedures, depending on the magnitude\nand scale of the project.\nc.  Adequacy of Baseline Information\n8.  In the past, many transport and energy projects were identified and designed with\ninadequate social, environmental, economic, institutional, spatial information in terms of (i) data\navailability, (ii) accessibility of existing data, (iii) data accuracy, (iv) capacity to integrate data\ninto early design, and (v) ability to identify and fill key data gaps. Integrated area planning\nrequires  such  information  to  be  available  prior  to  initiating  any  major  future  infrastructure\ndevelopment. Given that implementation of area-based planning processes will take time, and\nthat there are pressing infrastructure development needs, the priority is to ensure that planners", "38 Appendix 2, page 3\nand designers are able to access existing information and minimum data sets for all provinces\nso that sectoral planning can be based on more than episodic studies.\n9. During the past decade, databases established in central and sectoral agencies to meet\nthe discrete needs of particular agencies proliferated. Lack of a national coordination framework\nhas  resulted  in  compatibility  problems,  overlaps  in  data  collection,  differences  in  data\ndefinitions, and inadequate cataloguing of information. This perpetuates the inefficient use of\nscarce financial and human sources. There is no national reference point enabling planners to\nreadily locate databases. Data collection standards are largely absent. Data collection and\nstorage need to be coordinated and standardized so that data are accessible and useful to\nplanners and decision makers. Initial steps have been taken with the establishment at the\nNational Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute of a database with information on forestry,\nsoils/land  use/land  capability,  watersheds,  and  protected  areas.  However,  a  high-level\ncoordinated  effort  is  required  to  develop  a  rational  and  structured  national  information\nmanagement system that brings databases under common rules and definitions.\n3. Public Involvement\n10. Public involvement during planning, construction, and implementation stages has been\ncarried out with no national guidelines to direct the process. STEA has informally used United\nNations/Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  guidelines  for  public\nconsultations, but these are not practiced universally in the transport and energy sectors.\nConsequently, planners often failed to fully understand project impacts on local residents and\nvillage life. Villagers and non government organizations have an in-depth knowledge of local\nresources, capacities, and development needs that can help to improve project benefits and\navoid  negative  impacts  when  identified  early  through  consultation.  At  a  broader  level,  the\nchanging regulatory and institutional environment means that people often are unaware of their\nrights  and  responsibilities.  Getting  this  message  to  people  (and  potential  project  owners,\ncontractors,  and  consultants)  throughout  the  country  needs  to  be  undertaken.  Heightened\nawareness by the population of their rights and responsibilities can help increase transparency\nand facilitate compliance.\n4. Compliance and Monitoring\n11. Compliance with and monitoring of social and environmental regulations in infrastructure\ndevelopment remain weak. Effective compliance and monitoring of major infrastructure projects\nare particularly vital in the Lao PDR because the projects are often located in remote areas\nwhere communities live at a subsistence level, and where there are often important biological\nresources.\n12.  When a dispute arises with the contractor or project owner, the reference point is not the\nEIA or environmental action plan per se, but the contracts entered into by the parties. The\nGovernment and funding agencies have faced difficulties in forcing compliance, as detailed\nmanagement measures normally are not included in the various contractual documents, such\nas tenders, bills of quantity, concession agreements, and financial documents. Consequently,\nimpacts often go unmitigated and uncompensated unless additional funds are provided or until\nsufficient other pressure is brought to bear on the offending party, by which time the damage\nmay be significant. Thus, environmental management plans and social action plans need to be\nclearly  incorporated  in  contractual  documents,  with   penalties   for   noncompliance  that  are", "39 Appendix 2, page 4\nsufficiently strong to ensure that compliance is in the best interest of the contractor or project\nowner.\n13. Regular supervision and monitoring are just as important for social and environmental\nimpacts  as  for  the  engineering  aspects  of  project  construction.  Otherwise,  small,  easily\nremedied  problems  can  become  major  problems  requiring  costly  remedial  measures.\nSupervision and monitoring of social and environmental programs require expertise that is\nmostly  lacking  in-country.  Where  project  supervisory  and  monitoring  staff  perceive  that\nmonitoring results may lead to recommendations for additional mitigation requiring funding from\nproject contingencies, or that rectifying problems may delay construction schedules, there is a\nstrong tendency to put monitoring in abeyance or to ignore or rationalize monitoring results.\n14. Independent monitoring in the Lao PDR has been limited to a few projects, but has\nworked well for them. When local people and officials have been involved in monitoring, the\nlocal perspective has contributed to improved performance. Monitoring by local people can be a\ncost-effective way to identify impacts early before they get out of hand. Effective supervision\nand reporting procedures must be clearly identified and undertaken by trained professionals.\nThe ultimate objective should be to build an indigenous capacity for supervision and monitoring,\nthough the need for independent monitoring of large, complex projects will always remain.\n5. Institutional Capacity\n15. Weak  institutional  capacity  is  a  pervasive  constraint  to  improving  social  and\nenvironmental  management  of  infrastructure  projects  in  the  Lao  PDR.  STEA,  through  the\nDepartment of Environment (DOE), has ultimate responsibility for ensuring project compliance\nwith  social  and  environmental  standards.  This  is  done  by  reviewing  and  approving  EIAs;\nworking with line agencies to develop relevant laws, regulations, and guidelines; and providing\nenvironmental oversight of projects. The DOE currently has a staff of 120, of which only a\nhandful have been trained in the fields in which they work.\n16. DOE,  Electricit\u00e9  du  Lao  (EdL),  and  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  have  established\nenvironment management units (EMUs) with a staff of five, four, and five, respectively, but most\nEMU staff are engineers with no background in social or environmental fields. Environment\nunits are situated on the administrative fringes of their respective agencies and have limited\nability to influence decisions. DOR has provincial offices throughout the country. EdL\u2019s local\noffices are limited to areas where there are hydropower plants, and DOE has no local offices.\nThe EMUs need to be restructured and upgraded to fully functional social and environmental\nmanagement divisions with trained staff, resources, and direct access to senior departmental\ndecision makers. Interim measures are needed while capacity is being developed. Another\nneed is for the capacity to identify and recruit expertise from outside Government to conduct\nnecessary  studies,  assist  in  reviewing  complex  environmental  documentation,  undertake\ncompliance monitoring, and provide the technical know-how that may be required for special\nmitigation programs. A mentoring system should be used to closely involve environmental staff\nfrom the responsible central and line agencies in such activities.\n17.  The  Government\u2019s  decentralization  initiative  aims  to  transfer  major  planning,\nimplementation, and monitoring responsibility to the local level. Provincial STEA offices are to\nbe established in each province as Government focal points for local environmental action.\nThese offices are to be financed by, and report to, the provincial governor\u2019s office with technical\nsupport from STEA. Despite the formal establishment of a number of provincial offices, none is", "40 Appendix 2, page 5\nyet fully functioning. External support to build capacity at seven provincial offices is expected in\nthe near term. Some limited training has been provided for central and local staff, but a long-\nterm effort is needed to develop the capacity that will be required during the coming decades.\n6. Sustainable Financing\n18. Sustainable  financing  is  needed  to  redress  most  of  the  cited  deficiencies.  This  is\nespecially true for up-front planning (e.g., river basin planning), studies (e.g., fisheries), and\nother actions (environmental rehabilitation, community preparation) that are prerequisites for\ninformed sector-level decision making, and are needed to ensure the veracity of project-level\nenvironmental and social impact assessments. These assessments should ensure that project\ndesigns avoid or minimize adverse impacts and allow major environmental and social costs to\nbe  included  in  project  costs,  and  thus  be  borne  by  the  project  owners  rather  than  being\nexternalized. Funds are also required to develop the human resources needed for social and\nenvironmental management, to promote greater public involvement and awareness, and to\nsupport  independent  compliance  monitoring.  Funds  could  also  address  long-term  and\nunforeseen impacts during project operation, though with better up-front planning, the need for\nsuch funds should be limited. Several sectoral laws and the EPL mention environment funds.\nOther mechanisms, such as user charges, have been introduced but are not widely understood\nor practiced. This is an area worth exploring, especially in terms of a national fund that obviates\nduplication and complications inherent in the various sectoral laws.\n19. There  is  also  need  for  a  more  transparent  system  of  public  expenditure  on\nenvironmental protection and environmental programs. Currently it is not possible to relate\nenvironmental budget approvals with actual expenditures, nor is it possible to determine where\nthe funds to meet these expenditures were derived.\nC. Recent Experiences and Lessons from Policy-Based Lending\n20. ADB has financed four program loans to the Lao PDR: two to support agriculture sector\nreforms, and two to support financial sector reforms. ADB experience with policy-based lending\nin the Lao PDR has been partly satisfactory. While there have been implementation delays and\nsome policy reversals, program loans have helped push forward some important policy and\ninstitutional reforms in the agriculture and finance sectors.  A  recent  ADB  evaluation  of  the\nsecond  agriculture  program  loan  concluded  that  the  agreed-upon  policy  reforms  were\nimplemented and that agriculture production increased, but that there was concern about the\nsustainability of the policy measures and the program was rated as only partly successful.\nLessons learned from the program include the need to (i) allow longer lead time for reform\nmeasures that depend on the issuance of new legislation or regulation, (ii) take into account\ninstitutional capacity when designing privatization programs, (iii) focus policy reforms on fewer\nreforms that can realistically be implemented, (iv) recognize the executing agency monitoring\ncapacity in the program design, and (v) establish performance criteria to facilitate program\nassessment.\n21.  A series of technical assistance (TA) laid the foundations for the two financial sector\nprogram loans. A recent ADB evaluation concluded that despite ADB TA and program lending,\nthe  sector  remains  constrained  by  poor  loan  recovery,  management  weaknesses,  and\ninadequacies in prudential control. Basic market institutions that play a critical role in financial\nsector development (land mortgage systems, foreclosure systems, auditing and accounting\nprofessions) remain poorly developed. The Operations Evaluation Department concluded that", "41 Appendix 2, page 6\nADB experiences highlighted the importance of (i) correctly assessing absorptive capacity and\npolitical support for change; (ii) appropriate sequencing and priority in implementation; (iii) less\ncomprehensive TAs that require substantial achievement of prior targets for continued funding;\n(iv) strengthened accountability at all levels through agreed-upon performance monitoring; (v)\nclear designation of all responsibilities in TA design (terms of reference for consultants and key\ncounterparts); (vi) timely and accurate translations; (vii) full-time counterpart assistance; and\n(viii) avoiding overlapping TA or multi-component TAs where executing agencies lack qualified\nstaff. ADB and the Government needed to better document and build on the results of earlier\nTAs in subsequent assistance. The report also concluded that greater continuity of ADB staff\ncould  also  assist  in  developing  institutional  memory  and  expertise,  and  assist  in  reducing\ninconsistencies in policy advice.", "42 Appendix 3, page 1\nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Means of Verification Assumption/Risks\nGoal\nTo promote sustainable Sustainable economic and State of the Environment Political will to address\nand equitable social development while reports environment and social\ndevelopment in the Lao maintaining environment development continues to\nPDR quality and natural resources Regular sector reviews deepen.\nendowment\nStakeholders workshops\nPurpose\nTo improve National policy and Official notification, Adoption of appropriate\nenvironmental social regulatory framework catalogue of regulations, policy recommendations\nmanagement in the strengthened government reports and legislation\nenergy and transport\nsectors\nPolicy implementation Stakeholders' workshops, Sufficient resources\nmeasures and capacity at sector analysis, monitoring available and allocated\nsectoral and provincial levels and evaluation reports\nCompliance and Annual compliance reports Effective enforcement of\nenforcement strengthened measures; increased\nparticipation at local level\nEnergy and transport sector Planning documents Willingness of sectors to\nplanning to be done within coordinate and adopt area-\nan area-based framework based planning\nSustainable financing Government reports and Continued Government\nmechanisms established budget commitment, additional\nresources mobilized\nObjectives\n1.

The overall design of the loan and the development of the policy matrix involved and\nreflect extensive consultations with stakeholders at the national, regional, and community levels.\nPublic  consultations  were  undertaken  to  obtain  information  related  to  experiences  and\ninvolvement  with  large  infrastructure  projects,  especially  hydropower  and  roads.  Particular\nemphasis was given to consultation with stakeholders that share common concerns within the\nenergy and transport sectors. Issues discussed at all levels focused on how to improve social\nand environmental management based on current practice and past experience.\n2. At the national level, workshops, interviews, and discussions were held with numerous\nGovernment  agencies,  funding  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  other\ninterested parties from the start of the project to consider relevant issues and constraints in the\nsector, and to develop a potential policy matrix. The national workshops included presentations\nof the evolving drafts of the policy matrix and preliminary findings from regional and local\nconsultations. A consensus-building approach was adopted for developing the program loan\nand the policy matrix.\n3. At the regional level, meetings were held with key government officials from provincial\noffices,  line  agencies,  and  Science,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA)\nrepresentatives in the north, center, and south of the country. A combination of meetings with\nkey individuals involved in development activities at the province or district level, and workshops\nin  the  northern  (Luang  Nam  Tha),  central  (Pakxan)  and  southern  (Pakse)  regions  were\nconducted to discuss environmental and social management of large infrastructure projects.\nCommunity-level  discussions  at  10  project  sites  were  held  with  planners,  Government\nrepresentatives, and implementing agencies (NGOs, funding agencies, and project managers),\non the one hand, and affected populations on the other. The various views, concerns, and\nperspectives were analyzed and integrated into the loan design.\nA. National Consultations\n4. Numerous  national  consultations  were  held  from  the  start  of  the  project  to  assess\nenvironmental and social impact issues and to develop a draft of the policy matrix. Ongoing\ndiscussions with various Government ministries and departments were held throughout the\ntechnical assistance. The results of the discussions guided the design of the loan and policy\nmatrix.\n5. National workshops held at the STEA offices in Vientiane were attended by Government\nrepresentatives from STEA, energy and transportation line agencies, domestic and international\nconsultants, and NGOs. The workshop included presentation of drafts of the policy matrix and\npreliminary findings from regional and local consultations, as well as, problem-solving sessions\nand discussion groups and feedback.\n6. During the loan fact-finding mission, further public consultations were conducted at a\nworkshop attended by Government representatives, funding agencies, and NGOs to discuss the\nAsian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) draft environment policy. Individual consultations on the\npolicy matrix were also conducted with key Government agencies and funding agencies.

Background and Experience\n1. The experience of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) in planning and\nmanaging social and resettlement impacts of large infrastructure projects is extremely limited.\nSocial and resettlement impacts have been addressed either as salvage operations or, at best,\nin an ad hoc and unplanned manner, often in response to funding agency requirements or\nexternal criticism.1 Managing social risk and systematically addressing resettlement impacts\nremain a secondary, low-priority, side-effect of infrastructure development.2 Reactive responses\nrather than proactive planning initiatives best describe the general approach adopted to date.\n2. In respect of hydropower projects in the Lao PDR, the most affected populations are\noften ethnic minority communities in the remotest, least accessible parts of the country and\nliving in a subsistence economy. Recent poverty assessments identified these communities as\nthe poorest in the country: they have the lowest education and health indicators, and many\nexperience food deficit 3-6 months of the year.3 These communities have limited capacity to\nabsorb external shocks and cope with even minor impacts and disruptions. Large infrastructure\nprojects can and sometimes do result in dismantling of production systems; loss of productive\nassets and income sources; weakening of community structures, social networks and cultural\nidentity; dispersal of kin and other mutual support groups; and introduction of new diseases or\naggravation  of  endemic  diseases  such  as  malaria,  dysentery,  measles,  etc.  The  recently\nconducted PPA identified relocation due to development projects as one of the direct causes of\npoverty in some of these communities. Given the fragile nature of these groups, even minor\nimpacts  can  result  in  severe  long-term  economic  and  social  hardships,  exacerbating  their\nimpoverishment. It may take years for them to recover from the setback and shock.\n3. The Houay Ho project is one example of a completed hydropower project with no\nresettlement plan. As a result, people suffered from a severe shortage of food and arable land,\nand insufficient water supply. Remedial action to alleviate the most pressing hardships was\nfinally undertaken in 1999 at an approximate cost of $2.4 million. Likewise, in the Theun\nHinboun Hydropower Project, decreased fisheries downstream and significant changes in water\nflows have adversely impacted the livelihoods of approximately 26,000 people. Remedial and\ncorrective actions are likely to cost in the vicinity of $5 million.\n4. Mistakes such as these should not be repeated, and reactive responses to correct\nproblems as an after-thought are not in the national interest of the Lao PDR. It is critical that\nsocial and resettlement impacts are managed in a carefully planned and sensitive manner to\nminimize the social risks associated with large-scale infrastructure development. Failure to do\nso can contribute to exacerbating poverty and to potentially higher costs of correcting problems\nnot  addressed  earlier.  Efforts  aimed  at  poverty  reduction  will  be  undermined  and  the\nGovernment risks not meeting its own development goal of reducing poverty by half by the year\n2005.\n5. While resettlement impacts and social risks are generally more significant in hydropower\nprojects, road projects are not immune from generating such impacts, albeit, often on a lower\n                                                          \n1 With the exception of the Nam Theun 2 project and possibly Nam Ngiep 1, Rural Access Roads and East-West\nTransport Corridor project.\n2 World Bank Hydropower Development Strategy Study, Volume D: Annex 4.\n3 ADB\u2019s participatory poverty assessment (draft) and World Bank Poverty in Lao PDR. March 2001.", "63 Appendix 7, page 2\nscale. Development of major road networks and rural access roads also involve social and\nresettlement impacts. If such impacts are not anticipated and managed, any potential benefits to\nimprove livelihoods, increase market access, improve delivery of social services, and generally\nstimulate economic development will be lost. The potential benefits can be realized only if\nproper measures are in place to safeguard the interests of affected populations and ensure that\nbenefits are channeled to communities in the vicinity of such projects. Missed opportunities to\nenhance the material and social welfare of rural communities could have potentially broader\nadverse economic and social costs that the Lao PDR can ill afford.\n6. A bad track record of managing social and resettlement impacts can put at risk potential\nexternal  financing  of  infrastructure  development.  International  lending  agencies  review  a\ncountry\u2019s track record, as well as its legislative and policy framework in assessing the capacity\nto carry out resettlement without adverse affects to those resettled and negatively affected.\nGood social impact and resettlement plans can prevent impoverishment and can even reduce\npoverty  and  improve  livelihoods  by  building  sustainable  livelihoods.  World  Bank  and  ADB\nexperience demonstrates that political commitment of borrowers in the form of laws, policies,\nand  resource  allocations;  adherence  to  established  guidelines  and  procedures  in\nimplementation;  sound  social  analysis  and  appropriate  technical  expertise  in  planning\nresettlement;  and  people\u2019s  participation  in  setting  resettlement  objectives,  identifying\nreestablishment  solutions,  and  implementing  them  are  factors  that  contribute  to  good\nresettlement.  The  track  record  currently  being  created,  with  the  exception  of  that  for  the\nproposed World Bank-financed hydropower Nam Theun 2 (NT2) project,4 can put at risk future\ninternational funding for large infrastructure projects in the Lao PDR.\n7. While it is possible under the current situation\u2014with no national resettlement policy or\nguidelines in place\u2014to carry out resettlement at lesser standards, this is not considered to be in\nthe best national interest. The Lao PDR requires a national policy that enshrines a standard\napproach to addressing social impacts and resettlement comprehensively to include mitigation,\nmonitoring, and enforcing compliance. This will contribute to establishing an acceptable track\nrecord in this field that meets national objectives and international standards.\nB. National Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Compensation for Major Projects\n8. The Government is aware that it must address the glaring gap in the area of involuntary\nresettlement  and  compensation  for  major  projects.  Currently,  no  national  policy  articulates\nuniform  standards,  although  the  fundamental  principles  of  protecting  affected  people,\ncompensating them, and restoring livelihoods are enshrined in the Constitution and other laws.\nHowever, none of these laws deal coherently and systematically with the entire process of\nresettlement and compensation, or assign oversight responsibility to any Government agency or\ninstitution. Responsibility for resettlement planning, implementation, and monitoring remains\nvague. A comprehensive national policy on resettlement and compensation issued as a Prime\nMinister\u2019s  decree  is  required  to  provide  a  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  effectively\naddressing resettlement impacts that meet national objectives and international standards.\n9. A draft National Resettlement Policy for Major Projects in the Lao PDR, together with\ndraft  Resettlement  Regulations  was  prepared  on  behalf  of  the  Government  by  the  NT2\nResettlement Committee as part of the NT2 Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Following the\npreparation of the draft policy, extensive consultations through workshops were conducted with\n                                                          \n4 Although even the NT2 project has been criticized for its inadequate attention to downstream impacts.", "64 Appendix 7, page 3\nGovernment  officials  from  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels;  local  communities;  and\nrepresentatives  of  other  organizations.  In  1999,  after  incorporation  of  comments  and\nsuggestions the draft was finalized and included in the NT2 RAP. The Government adopted the\nNT2 RAP, but not the draft national policy that provides a single nationwide standard applicable\nto all major projects in the Lao PDR.\n10. The draft national policy on resettlement prepared under the NT2 RAP defines key terms\nand consists of (i) the objectives of the policy, such as improved livelihood, compensation and\nentitlements of affected persons; (ii) an outline of the legal framework; (iii) principles of the\npolicy that address the issues of compensation, vulnerable groups, and consultations; (iv) rights\nof compensation; (v) financial resources and budget; (vi) management of resettlement, that is,\nthe administrative and institutional setup; and (vii) steps in implementing the policy. The draft\nregulations consist of requirements for statistical data collection, contents of the implementation\nschedule, a dispute resolution mechanism, and provisions for monitoring. Adoption of the policy\nwill ensure uniform national standards for dealing with social risk and involuntary resettlement\nimpacts. It will also bring the Lao PDR into line with international standards and with the World\nBank\u2019s OD.4.3 on involuntary resettlement and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.\n11. The draft policy is an important document as it clearly outlines the Lao Government\u2019s\npolicy and standards for involuntary resettlement and compensation. Formal adoption of the\npolicy by the Government is critical if involuntary resettlement and compensations issues are to\nbe addressed in a consistent and systematic manner for all major projects, in line with the\nGovernment\u2019s own laws and international standards. Without the adoption of the national policy\nas a Prime Minister\u2019s decree, involuntary resettlement and compensation will continue to be\nplanned and implemented in an ad hoc, project-by-project basis as a secondary low-priority\nactivity. A single nationwide standard applicable to all major projects needs to be established.\nOtherwise, sectoral resettlement and compensation guidelines to be adopted by the energy and\ntransport sectors as second tranche conditions for this program loan may be compromised if\nthey are not derived from and supported by a national policy issued in the form of a decree.\nC. Involuntary Resettlement and Compensation Guidelines\n12. The  draft  involuntary  resettlement  and  compensation  guidelines  for  the  energy  and\ntransport  sectors  attempt  to  incorporate  international  standards  on  resettlement  planning,\nimplementation, and monitoring within the Lao PDR\u2019s development context. Although not legally\nbinding, the guidelines aim to facilitate compliance with existing policies and regulations.\n13. Detailed resettlement guidelines for the hydropower sector were prepared under the\nWorld Bank-assisted Hydropower Development Strategy for the Lao PDR. Consultations and\ndiscussion of these guidelines should be conducted so that they can be finalized and issued as\na ministerial guideline for implementation in MIH/DOE. Likewise, resettlement guidelines were\ndeveloped for the transport sector under ADB\u2019s TA 3133-LAO.5 The latter guidelines need\nrefining and editing, together with stakeholder consultations, prior to finalizing and issuing them\nas a ministerial guideline for MCTCP/DOR.\n14. The  resettlement  guidelines  in  both  sectors  outline  preconstruction  activities  at  the\nplanning  stage,  socioeconomic  and  cultural  information  required  for  planning,  institutional\narrangements  for  resettlement,  activities  in  the  implementation  phase,  resettlement  and\n                                                          \n5 TA 3133-LAO: Strengthening Social and Environmental Management Project, for $950,000, approved on 22\nDecember 1998.", "65 Appendix 7, page 4\ncompensation for rights-of-way (roads and transmission lines), monitoring of resettlement in the\nimplementation and operational phases, and funding issues. Guidelines that address the issue\nof  improving  livelihoods  of  project-affected  persons  are  also  included.  Examples  of  good\npractice in the Lao PDR are outlined under many of the specific guidelines.\n15. Currently, the guidelines are incorporated into the energy and road sector environment\nimpact assessment (EIA) guidelines and are planned to be issued along with the EIA guidelines.\nImproving international standards for addressing resettlement combined with the complexities of\naddressing  a  myriad  of  potential  social  impacts,  it  is  more  appropriate  to  issue  separate\nministerial guidelines on involuntary resettlement and compensation for the two sectors.\nD. National Policy on Public Involvement and Participation\n16. In the Lao PDR, all key legislation mentioned earlier, recognize and support to varying\ndegrees the need for public involvement and participation. The EPL specifically refers to the\nneed to consult with project-affected people in the EIA process while the draft resettlement\npolicy states that \u201cthe affected persons are to take part in public consultation and to participate\nin the decision process on resettlement activities and on compensation entitlements prior to the\nimplementation of the process.\u201d While the need for public involvement and participation is\nendorsed in a number of Government policies, laws, and sector strategies, a clear Government\npolicy on public involvement and participation that provides the framework for the conduct of\nconsultations to promote participation, transparency, and accountability is absent.\n17. A major constraint to the development of appropriate and culturally suitable development\nprojects and mitigation packages for large infrastructure projects is the lack of knowledge about\nthe  needs,  priorities,  willingness,  and  capacity  of  affected  communities  to  adapt  to  new\neconomic and physical environments. In the absence of an institutional mechanism to facilitate\nroutine consultation and participation of all stakeholders, including affected communities, proper\nplanning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  project-related  impacts  will  not  be  achieved.\nConsistent with the Government\u2019s commitment to participatory planning to determine people\u2019s\nneeds, priorities, and aspirations, the principle of public involvement and participation should be\nenshrined  in  a  broad  Government  policy.  To  encourage  and  support  routine  and  regular\nconsultation  of  communities  in  preparing  and  implementing  projects  that  affect  them,  the\nGovernment  should  issue  a  policy  statement  and  guidelines  on  public  involvement  and\nparticipation.\n18. Public involvement guidelines for natural resource development projects were prepared\nby United Nations Development Programme/Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific in 1997. Under ADB\u2019s TA 3133-LAO (footnote 5), completed in October 2000, public\ninvolvement guidelines were prepared based on lessons learned from the NT2 experience,\nwhere considerable public participation was undertaken by the project developer in accordance\nwith  international  best  practice.  The  guidelines  include  key  definitions  and  guidance  on\nplanning, implementing, and monitoring the involvement of affected communities during the\nproject cycle. To promote and institutionalize public involvement, these guidelines should be\nrefined after further public and stakeholder consultations, adopted, and issued by the President\nof Science, Technology and Environment Agency.", "66 Appendix 8\nPRINCIPLES FOR THE DESIGN AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT FUND\n1.
