INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of China  (PRC)  requested  a  policy  and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA)1 to strengthen the PRC\u2019s capacity to manage uncontrolled \nlandfills. 2 ADB undertook a reconnaissance mission in June 2012 and reached agreement with \nthe Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development (MOHURD) on TA impact, outcome, \noutputs, cost and financing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for \nconsulting services. 3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Sustained economic growth in the PRC since the start of economic reform in 1978 has \nbrought rapid urbanization. The urban population grew from 160 million in 1975 to 670 million in \n2010. Continuing urbanization will remain an essential pillar of growth and development in the \nPRC, but it poses a variety of environmental challenges. A major challenge is the rapid increase \nin  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW)  caused  by  population  growth  and  increasing  resource \nconsumption per capita. No other country has experienced MSW quantity expansion as great or \nas rapid as the PRC has faced in the last 25 years, increasing by 4% per annum. In 2010, the \nPRC generated 157 million tons of MSW, or a quarter of the world total.4  \n \n3.  The formal management of MSW in the PRC started only in the late 1980s. Prior to the \nEighth Five-Year Plan, 1991\u20131995, most MSW went into dumps managed with very limited \nformal engineering standards or none at all.5 The situation has improved greatly since 1995, \nafter  which  sanitary  waste  disposal  capacity  significantly  increased  in  response  to  the \nenactment of the first legislation on MSW management: the Act of Prevention and Control of \nSolid  Waste  Pollution  to  the  Environment,  1995. 6 During  the  9th  plan,  1996\u20132000,  the \npercentage of MSW disposed of in sanitary facilities increased from 40% to 50%. The sanitary \ndisposal of MSW has remained an important target of subsequent 5-year plans. By the end of \nthe 11th plan, 2006\u20132010, cities\u2019 and counties\u2019 capacity to collect and dispose of MSW had \nreached 221 million tons per year. However, this failed to keep pace with the quantity of MSW \nproduced, and the proportion of MSW safely handled had reached only 64% by the end of \n2010.7 More than 60 million tons of MSW is inadequately disposed of each year, ending up in \nuncontrolled landfills.   \n \n4.  The disposal of solid waste in uncontrolled landfills has created serious environmental \nconcerns. The government estimates that several thousand uncontrolled landfills exist in or near \nmajor cities and towns in the PRC.8 These sites occupy land that could be better used, hinder \nurban development, contaminate groundwater and soil, and produce greenhouse gases and \n                                                \n1  The technical assistance is included  in People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s country operations business plan (2012\u2013\n2014). \n2  This term covers open dump sites and uncontrolled landfills for municipal solid waste that do not comply with the \nPRC technical code for municipal solid waste landfills (CJJ17-2004). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 August 2012. \n4  ADB. 2012. Toward an Environmentally Sustainable Future: Country Environmental Analysis of the PRC. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2012. Urban Wastewater and Solid Waste Management for Small Cities and Towns. Consultant\u2019s final report. \nManila (TA 7002-PRC). \n6  The latest amended version of which became effective on 1 April 2005. The Ministry of Environment Protection \nalso issued a standard for controlling pollution from MSW landfills (GB16889-2008) in 2008. \n7  Master Plan for National Urban Domestic Solid Waste Treatment Facilities under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (File \nNo. 23 of the General Office of the State Council, 2012).  \n8  These are populations centers with a permanent population of over 30,000 inhabitants, according to the Master \nPlan for National Urban Domestic Solid Waste Treatment Facilities under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. \n ", "2   \ntoxic air emissions, contributing to climate change.9 They significantly affect community health \nand safety by providing breeding grounds for rats and other disease vectors.   \n \n5.  The government is aware of the problems and risks associated with current waste-\ndisposal practices and the legacy of uncontrolled landfills. To combat these problems, the \ngovernment  has  passed  laws  to  protect  the  environment  from  landfill  contamination.  The \nproblem is prominently addressed in the Master Plan for National Urban Domestic Solid Waste \nTreatment Facilities, 2012\u20132015 under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. Among other \ntasks, the plan targets the rehabilitation and securing of 1,882 uncontrolled landfills in or near \nmajor cities and towns at a cost of CNY21.1 billion to 2015.10 The plan prioritizes rehabilitating \nsites that hinder urban development at the urban\u2013rural fringe or pose important risks to water \nresources. The plan highlights the need to control landfill rehabilitation taking into account local \nconditions, capacity, and needs. However, the necessary technical knowledge and financial, \ninstitutional, and regulatory frameworks are still underdeveloped in the PRC.  \n \n6.  To address these shortcomings and work toward achieving the goals set under the \nmaster  plan,  the  government  requested  TA  to  strengthen  the  PRC\u2019s  capacity  to  manage \nheretofore uncontrolled landfills. TA preparation reflects extensive consultations with MOHURD \nand other key stakeholders. MOHURD will coordinate this initiative along with parallel activities \nunder the master plan. \n \n7.  The TA is consistent with the Twelfth Five-Year Plan and will support the implementation \nof the master plan. It aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2011\u20132015, \nwhich  assigns  high  priority  to  strengthening  the  protection  of  land  and  water  resources, \nimproving waste management toward mitigating climate change, and developing livable and \nlow-carbon  cities. 11By  promoting  environmentally  sustainable  growth  and  tackling  MSW \nmanagement, the TA also aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and the draft urban operational \nplan.12 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  will  be  strengthened  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks  and  improved \ninstitutional capacity to rehabilitate uncontrolled landfills for sanitary MSW disposal in the PRC. \nThe outcome will be agreed recommendations and guidelines to improve the management of \nuncontrolled landfills. This will be achieved by helping the government (i) to develop technical \nguidelines  on  landfill  remediation  (including  clean-up  or  containment),  land  reuse  and \n                                                \n9  Emissions of methane from landfills in the PRC are estimated at 3 million\u20139 million tons per year, thus contributing \nsignificantly  to  global  warming.

The government has not yet translated this \ndocument into English and thus this title originates from an unofficial translation. The plan focuses on (i) \nconstruction  of  safe-disposal  facilities,  (ii)  improving  MSW  collection  and  transfer,  (iii)  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement of existing landfill sites, (iv) management of organic waste, (v) sorting of household waste, and (vi)  \nstrengthening of monitoring and supervision. \n11 ADB. 2012.

Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will have four outputs: (i) a review of uncontrolled landfill management in the \nPRC; (ii) technical guidelines for remediating uncontrolled landfills, including guidelines for (a) \ninvestigating  sites  and  assessing  their  risks,  (b)  selecting  remediation  options  regarding \ninstitutional control and containment and clean-up technologies, (c) planning the implementation \nof remediation, (d) planning environment management, and (e) planning post-remediation site \nredevelopment, land reuse, monitoring, and supervision; (iii) recommendations for a national \nframework for managing uncontrolled landfills, including adjustments to financial, institutional, \nand regulatory frameworks; and (iv) developing a strategy to disseminate TA findings. 13 \n \n10.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. Phase 1 (3 months) will (i) review current \nwaste disposal practices in the PRC;14 (ii) review existing legal and policy frameworks in the \nPRC and existing national, provincial, and municipal institutional structures for remediating \nuncontrolled landfills, which will include planning policies toward and technical methods of \nrehabilitating and redeveloping uncontrolled landfills and determining the potential long-term \nliabilities of parties involved; (iii) provide an overview of international best practice relevant to \nthe PRC for managing uncontrolled landfills, including legal, policy, and planning frameworks \nand methodologies to characterize risks and assess and remediate sites; (iv) prepare an outline \nof  technical  guidelines  for  remediating  uncontrolled  landfills,  including  investigating  sites, \nassessing risk, remediation, monitoring and supervision, and redevelopment; and (v) organize a \nstakeholders\u2019 workshop at the end of this phase to discuss the outline technical guidelines. \n \n11.  Phase 2 (7 months) will (i) draft technical guidelines for uncontrolled landfill remediation; \n(ii)  prepare  five  pilot  studies  in  selected  municipalities  to  assess  the  seriousness  of \ncontamination and environmental and public health risks at uncontrolled landfills and to test and \nvalidate  the  draft  guidelines  for  investigating  sites  and  assessing  risks;  (iii)  organize  an \ninternational study tour on which five government staffers will obtain further guidance toward \ndeveloping  the  proposed  framework;  (iv)  evaluate  potential  financing  mechanisms  for \nuncontrolled landfill remediation; (v) recommend necessary adjustments to financial, legislative, \nand regulatory frameworks; and (vi) organize a workshop to discuss the findings of the field \nvalidation and the policy recommendations and draft technical guidelines. \n \n12.  Phase 3 (4 months) will (i) finalize the draft technical guidelines for site investigation, risk \nassessment, and remediation to be submitted to MOHURD and (ii) develop a strategy for \nknowledge dissemination that will include (a) participation at national conferences and technical \nsymposiums, (b) organizing an international symposium to share findings and experiences, and \n(c) the publication of at least one policy note.   \n \n13.  Major risks to the successful implementation of the TA are the (i) inadequate or delayed \nprovision  of  necessary  data,  (ii)  delayed  submission  of  required  studies,  (iii)  inadequate \nperformance of consultants, and (iv) inefficient dissemination of TA findings and outputs. To \nmitigate risks, the recruitment and performance of consultants will be monitored closely. The \ngovernment  has  agreed  to  provide  all  necessary  data  in  a  timely  manner  and  adequate \n                                                \n13 This output will include identifying possible demonstration projects and  the publication of at least one policy note.   \n14 This will include identifying key drivers of waste disposal in uncontrolled landfills and analyzing their environmental \nand socioeconomic impacts. \n ", "4   \ncounterpart support. Close coordination among the consultants, MOHURD, and ADB will further \nmitigate  risks,  as  will  the  development  and  implementation  of  a  knowledge  dissemination \nstrategy in consultation with the project steering committee.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2013other  sources).  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, remuneration \nand per diem for counterpart staff, city transport, miscellaneous administration and support \ncosts, and other in-kind contributions. Cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 14 months from 2 January 2013 to 28 February 2014. \nMOHURD will be the executing and implementing agency. ADB has built a strategic partnership \nwith MOHURD through a series of highly relevant and successful TA projects.15 These have \nyielded a progression of national policy frameworks and guidelines on key urban environmental \nissues facing large and medium-sized cities in the PRC, including water and wastewater tariffs, \nfinancing solid waste management services, and promoting wastewater reuse and beneficial \nsludge  utilization.  This  TA  will  complement  previous  TA  projects,  which  identified  the \nuncontrolled disposal of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge as an important constraint on \nsustainable urban development. MOHURD will establish a project steering committee. The \ncommittee  will  be  chaired  by  the  vice-director  of  the  Urban  Development  Department  of \nMOHURD and will include representatives from relevant departments of MOHURD, the Ministry \nof Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Land \nand Resources. \n \n16.  The TA will finance consulting services, workshops, training, field work, and survey costs. \nConsulting services totaling 32 person-months (6 person-months international and 26 person-\nmonths national) will be required. Consultants will provide expertise in remediating landfills, \ncleaning  up contaminated  sites, managing  and  reusing  MSW, environmental  management, \nurban planning, environment economics and finance, and legislative and institutional aspects of \nenvironmental management.  \n \n17.  Consultants will be engaged through a firm according to ADB Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time) using quality- and cost-based selection \ncriteria  and  simplified  technical  proposal  procedures.  A  quality\u2013cost  weighting  of  90:10  is \nconsidered  appropriate  because  the  TA  is  a  multidisciplinary  assignment  that  requires \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2001.
