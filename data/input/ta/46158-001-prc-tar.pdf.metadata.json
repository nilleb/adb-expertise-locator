INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2011  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide Yunnan \nProvince  with  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance (TA)1 for Industrial  Development  in \nSupport  of  Yunnan's  Outward-Oriented  Economic  Development  Strategy.  Following \nconsultations with the Yunnan provincial government and other stakeholders during 11\u201313 April \n2012,  a  fact-finding  mission  during  16\u201317  July  2012  agreed  on  the  objectives,  scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  costs,  and  terms  of  reference  of  the  TA.  The  mission  also \nassessed  the  executing  agency\u2019s  capacity  to  execute  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Yunnan has abundant natural resources, hydropower potential, and tourist attractions. \nGeographically, it is strategically located in the southwestern part of the PRC and serves as the \ngateway connecting the country to Southeast and South Asia and beyond. However, Yunnan is \none of the poorest provinces in the PRC. Promoting Yunnan\u2019s economic development is an \nurgent need to address poverty in the province and promote regionally balanced development in \nthe country. Developing Yunnan\u2019s characteristic industries3 with strong growth potential is seen \nas an engine of inclusive growth. Such development needs to capitalize on abundant resources \nand human resource potential and take full advantage of Yunnan being an important land bridge \nto members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and beyond.  \n \n3.  Promotion  of  regionally  balanced  development  for  inclusive  growth.  Rapid \neconomic growth in the PRC since the onset of economic reforms in 1978 has dramatically \nreduced poverty. The number of absolute poor per PRC poverty standard in rural areas fell from \n250 million in 1978 to just 27 million in 2010, and the incidence of poverty declined from 15% to \n2%.4 However, worsening income inequality has emerged as a serious concern. Income gaps \nhave widened between urban and rural areas, and between the eastern coastal and less-\ndeveloped central and western regions. \n \n4.  The government has steadily increased investments in a vast array of programs aimed \nspecifically at poverty reduction. 5 In February 2012, the State Council announced the Plan for \nFurther Promoting the Economy of the Western Regions, a step to narrow the gap between the \ncountry\u2019s  wealthy  coastal  provinces  and  its  underdeveloped  western  regions.  The  Yunnan \nprovincial government has made substantial efforts to accelerate its economic development, as \nstipulated  in  the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Development  Plan  of  Yunnan  Province,  2011\u20132015. \nHowever, Yunnan needs to properly orient its development plan and focus development efforts \non selected characteristic industries to improve its trade competitiveness, and further propel its \neconomic development and contribute toward a more regionally balanced and inclusive growth.  \n \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in the Country Operations Business Plan 2012\u20132014 for the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 August 2012. \n3  In the PRC, \u201ccharacteristic industry\u201d commonly refers to an industry or industrial cluster in which a region has \ncompetitive  advantage.  These  comparative  advantages  or  characteristics  are  developed  from  the  region\u2019s   \nspecialities in technology, culture, talents, natural resources, geographical location, and ecological environment.      \n4  The government revised the poverty line to CNY2,300 per person per annum in November 2011, which has    \nresulted in more than 100 million rural persons reclassified as poor. \n5  According to past and current five-year plans for national economic and social development; the China Rural \nPoverty Alleviation and Development Outline, 2001\u20132010 and 2011\u20132020; and other policy-related initiatives. \n ", " 2 \n5.  Acceleration  of  outward-oriented  economic  development.  In  July  2009,  the \nPresident of the PRC proposed to make Yunnan the major gateway for the PRC\u2019s cooperation \nwith Southeast and South Asia, and the Mekong River valley. The State Council, in its Opinions \non Supporting Yunnan Province to Accelerate the Construction of an Important Gateway Open \nto  the  Southwestern  Region  issued  in  May  2011  (the  State  Council  Gateway  Opinions), \nhighlighted development of characteristic industries as one of the eight measures, which also \ninclude strengthening basic infrastructure, optimizing logistics and corridors, deepening trade \nrelationships with neighboring countries, protecting the environment, ensuring social services, \nand accelerating poverty alleviation.6 In 2010, Yunnan\u2019s foreign trade increased by 67% where \n34.5% of Yunnan\u2019s total foreign trade was with ASEAN members. The establishment of the \nASEAN Economic Community by 2015 will create further favorable environment for Yunnan\u2019s \nforeign trade. \n \n6.  Acceleration  of  characteristic  industries  development.  The  Yunnan  provincial \ngovernment  recognizes  the  contribution  of  industrial  development  to  local  and  regional \neconomies. It called for accelerating the development of characteristic industries and actively \nmobilizing  financial  sources  in  its  Twelfth  Five-Year  Development  Plan.  Subsequently,  the \nYunnan provincial Department of Finance (DOF) through its Yunnan Characteristic Industries \nDevelopment and Financial Source Mobilization Action Plan, 2011\u20132015,7 identified 13 key \ncharacteristic industries for support.8  \n \n7.   However, these selections were based on existing volume of industrial production and \ntrade patterns and did not take into account opportunities arising from future trade and supply \nchain development linking Yunnan and ASEAN member countries. Prudent evaluation criteria \nfrom the perspective of developing an outward-oriented economy need to be applied when \nidentifying characteristic industries. A comprehensive and effective strategy for characteristic \nindustry development is required to attract investment, encourage private sector participation, \nand promote cross-border trade. In addition, the government needs to upgrade the industrial \nstructure to move toward low-carbon and high value-addition part of the production chain.9 \n \n8.  The  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  PRC,  2011\u2013201510 promotes  inclusive \ngrowth with a focus on the lesser-developed interior regions as one of three strategic pillars, \nalong with environmentally sustainable growth and regional cooperation and integration. ADB\u2019s \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Strategy supports trade and investment cooperation and \nintegration. The TA support complements initiatives led by the PRC and Yunnan province for \npoverty  reduction  and  inclusive,  regionally  balanced  growth  through  characteristic  industry \n                                                \n6  The State Council committed that the government would support the gateway project through tax policies, financing, \ninvestment, and various forms of compensation. \n7   With the cooperation of the Yunnan Academy of Scientific and Technical Information. \n8  Non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, phosphorus chemicals, biopharmaceuticals, equipment manufacturing, sugar \nprocessing, grain and oil products, paper processing, beverages, tea products, fruit and vegetable processing, \nlivestock poultry processing, and rubber products. The report also proposed five major objectives (developing \nindustry;  increasing  fiscal  revenue;  expanding  employment;  stimulating  investment;  and  serving  agriculture, \nfarmers and rural areas), three indicators (fiscal revenue reaching 100 million, the germination of initial public \nofferings, and support for enterprises\u2019 expansion), and complementary measures. In the early 1990s, Yunnan \ngovernment announced plans to develop five pillar industries: tobacco, mining, power (mainly hydropower), bio-\nindustry, and tourism. Priority industries were later selected to include bio-industry, optoelectronics, high-end \nequipment manufacturing, advanced materials, energy conservation and environmental protection, and new energy \nresources for the Twelfth Five-year Plan period. \n9  Recommended by ADB. 2009.

The TA will help the provincial government maximize the economic benefits from \ntransport infrastructure development in the region and the free-trade agreement between the \nPRC  and  ASEAN,  and  will  also  help  address  emerging  social  issues  arising  from  the \naccelerated pace of urbanization and industrialization.  \n   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n9.  The impact of the TA will be inclusive, regionally balanced growth in the PRC, with \nYunnan\u2019s outward-oriented economic development as a key part. The attainment of this impact \nwill be demonstrated through the establishment of characteristic industry bases, increased trade, \nand higher provincial gross domestic product. The TA outcome is the development strategy for \nselected characteristic industries adopted by the Yunnan provincial government that focuses on \nestablishing industrial bases to support outward-oriented economic development. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n10.   The TA will help the government identify 3\u20135 characteristic industries particularly those \nwith potential to contribute to Yunnan\u2019s outward-oriented economic development and prepare \nthe development strategy for selected characteristic industries. Key activities of the TA will \nproceed in three phases: (i) conducting background studies, (ii) establishing selection criteria \nand prioritizing characteristic industries, and (iii) preparing a strategy and action plan, and \nknowledge products for developing the selected characteristic industries. In the TA inception, a \nworkshop  for  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  researchers,  and  other  key \nstakeholders will be organized to discuss the TA implementation plan. A seminar or workshop \nwill be organized for each phase to disseminate and discuss major findings and implications for \nnext steps.  \n \n11.  TA outputs will correspond to the three phases: (i) an analysis of Yunnan\u2019s potential to \ndevelop an outward-oriented economy aimed at industrial integration and trade with ASEAN \ncountries, based on studies (i)\u2013(iii) below; (ii) a cost\u2013benefit analysis of adopting policies and \nenabling conditions that will promote selected characteristic industries of Yunnan based on the \nstudy (iv) below; and (iii) a strategy and action plan for developing and sustainably expanding \nselected  characteristic  industries,  based  on  studies  (v)\u2013(vi)  below.  The  TA  will  deliver  a \ncomprehensive report that will comprise six studies on:  \n(i)  Yunnan\u2019s  outward-oriented  economic  development  and  industrial \nintegration  and  trade  with  members  of  ASEAN.  The  study  will  analyze \nYunnan\u2019s industrial and trade structures in comparison with those of ASEAN \ncountries, assess the outward-oriented economic development strategy in line \nwith  the  State  Council  Gateway  Opinions,  recommend  policies  to  promote \nYunnan\u2019s  outward-oriented  economic  development  and  trade  with  ASEAN \ncountries,  and  propose  development  options  for  characteristic  industries  in \nYunnan. \n(ii)  Characteristic industries\u2019 development in Yunnan. The study will analyze the \ndevelopment  of  characteristic  industries  in  Yunnan  in  connection  with  the \nrequirements for outward-oriented economic development, analyze their current \nstatus and trends, identify and explain their contribution to implementation of the \nState  Council  Gateway  Opinions,  and  recommend  policies  to  accelerate  the \ndevelopment of Yunnan\u2019s characteristic industries. \n ", " 4 \n(iii)  Case studies of characteristic industries in Yunnan. The studies will select \ntypical  characteristic  industries  supporting  outward-oriented  economic \ndevelopment; analyze them from the perspectives of the region, industry, and \nenterprise;  identify  factors  for  success  and  constraints;  and  assess  policy \noptions.  \n(iv)  Establishment of evaluation criteria and methodology and selection of key \ncharacteristic  industries. The study will analyze the evaluation criteria and \nmethodologies  of  comparable  countries for  selecting key  strategic  industries, \ncollect and process data using statistical analysis, and prioritize characteristic \nindustries through quantitative analysis. \n(v)  Construction of characteristic industrial bases in Yunnan.11 The study will \npropose approaches to constructing industrial bases for selected characteristic \nindustries, quantitatively analyze existing data, identify measures to support the \nconstruction of the characteristic industrial bases, and propose an action plan. \n(vi)  Development strategy for selected characteristic industries. The study will \noffer  key  policy  recommendations,  prepare  a  strategy  and  action  plan,  and \nproduce  knowledge  products  to  promote  the  development  of  characteristic \nindustries in Yunnan. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office space, counterpart staff, transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n13.  The executing agency will be the DOF, and the implementing agency will be the Yunnan \nAcademy  of  Scientific  and  Technical  Information  (YASTI).12 DOF  will  designate  a  project \ncoordinator and will be responsible for the overall execution and coordination of TA activities. \nUnder the guidance of DOF, YASTI will be responsible for day-to-day TA implementation. DOF \nand  YASTI  will,  in  coordination  with  ADB,  provide  necessary  guidance  to  consultants, \nparticularly to ensure study consistency and avoid any overlap. Consultants will discuss the \nstudy framework with DOF, YASTI, and ADB and regularly report to them on study progress and \nresults.  \n \n14.  The TA is included in the list of delegated TA projects for 2012. The fact-finding mission \nreviewed DOF capacity for procurement and managing consulting services for the TA. As only \nindividual  consultants  are  intended  to  be  selected,  simplified  capacity  assessment  was \nconducted. The review  found that  DOF  had sufficient  experience  in  implementing  projects \nfunded by ADB and the World Bank, including procurement and supervising consulting services \ninvolving  international  consultants.  The  assessment  concluded  that  DOF\u2019s  capacity  was \n                                                \n11  An industrial base can be regarded as an industrial complex capable of conducting research and development; and \ndesigning, producing, delivering, and maintaining industrial systems, components, or parts to meet industrial \nrequirements. It can be one of industrial cluster, industrial park, border trade zone, raw material base, processing \nbase, exporting base, or industrial belt. \n12  YASTI is subordinate to the Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department but also an independent \npublic welfare organization in scientific research fully financed by the province. Key features of the implementing \nagency relevant to TA implementation include that it is a Yunnan institution for formulating development strategy; \nsupporting provincial policy, decision making, and strategic planning; and evaluating provincial projects. \n ", "5 \n \nadequate to recruit individual consultants, procure goods through shopping procedures, and \nmanage the study in cooperation with the implementing agency.13 It recommended approving \nthe delegation of the TA to DOF. In line with the enhanced partnership approach,14 delegation is \nlimited  to  the  selection  of  international  and  national  consultants,  and  short-term  resource \npersons. ADB will negotiate and sign the contracts with consultants and resource persons. After \ncontract signing, implementation is the responsibility of DOF. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 20 months, starting on 1 November 2012 and ending \non 30 June 2014. The TA will require 4.0 person-months of international consulting services and \n24.5 person-months of national consulting services. The consultants will deliver, in both English \nand  Chinese,  a  comprehensive  report  comprising  six  studies.  They  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The office equipment \nprovided  under  the  TA  for  the  consultants  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and handed over to DOF upon \nTA  completion.  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). DOF may use an advance \npayment facility to procure equipment and conduct seminars and workshops. \n \n16.  Major project activities will be regularly monitored and reported on by DOF and/or YASTI, \nas well as by ADB review missions. Consultants\u2019 reports will be presented at workshops and \nseminars organized to validate findings. Reports will be made available on the ADB website in \nEnglish and Chinese and published in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy \n(2011). \n \nIV.
