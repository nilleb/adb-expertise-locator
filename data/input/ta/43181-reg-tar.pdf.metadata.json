INTRODUCTION \n1.  The First Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted that the \"greatest single \nimpact of climate change could be on human migration with millions of people displaced by \nshoreline  erosion,  coastal  flooding  and  agricultural  disruption\".1 Over  the  next  decade,  a \nconsiderable number of people could be affected by hydrological and meteorological hazards, \nparticularly in South and Southeast Asia. People affected by these intensifying hazards will \ncome  under  substantial  pressure  to  migrate  (temporarily  or  permanently,  and  internally  or \nacross borders). Estimates of the number of people involved are highly controversial, and range \nfrom hundreds of millions to billions.2 \n \n2.  Sudden  disasters  associated  with  climate  change  are  most  likely  to  occur  in  \u201chot \nspots\u201d\u2014low-lying coastal areas, heavily populated delta areas, low-lying islands and atolls, and \nother areas\u2014where communities are already highly vulnerable to climate-related hazards. \n \n3.  The region has 4.1 billion people,3 and faces enormous environmental management \npressures. There are also high numbers of climate change hot spots in the region\u2014specific \nareas or regions that may be at relatively high risk of adverse impact from one or more natural \nhazards  resulting  from  climate  change 4 \u2014with  high  population  densities  (particularly  in \nmegacities). It is likely that migration will occur in these hot spots as the impacts of climate \nchange are felt. While some displacements are typically temporary, the sudden expulsion of \nlarge numbers of people from their home area can place significant pressure on regional and \nnational authorities to provide for their immediate needs. \n \n4.  Human displacement resulting from climate change will pose a major threat to the \nsustainable growth and security of Asia and the Pacific unless measures are taken soon. \nClimate-induced migration will undermine economic growth; increase pressure on infrastructure \nand services; enhance the risk of conflict; and lead to deterioration of social, health, and \neducational indicators. It represents an important potential brake on the region\u2019s recent rapid \neconomic growth.  \n \n5.  An  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  study  underscored  the  urgency  of  developing \npolicies, appropriate institutions and mechanisms to cope with the impact of climate change on \nmigration.5 It emphasized that migration will become a major adaptive response to climate \nchange and will add to the already increasing level and complexity of population mobility in the \nregion, but stressed that the scale and scope of these impacts cannot be specified at present. It \nis possible, however, to identify the areas most likely to be impacted by climate change-induced \nmigration,  and  outline  broad  policy  recommendations  to  address  surrounding  issues.  This \ntechnical assistance (TA)6 builds on the recommendations of the previous study.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Quoted in Oli Brown. 2008.

Dilley et al. 2005. Natural Disaster Hotspots: A Global Risk Analysis.

Manila (TA 6479-REG). \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 7 December 2009. \n ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n6.  Asia and the Pacific is one of the world\u2019s most natural disaster-prone regions. Eight of \nthe 15 countries at highest risk of experiencing three or more natural hazards are in Asia and \nthe Pacific, while half of the top 60 at risk of experiencing two or more hazards are in the \nregion (footnote 3). There is a strong correlation between areas most at risk from natural \nhazards and areas at greatest risk of being impacted by climate change. Under the most \nscientifically robust projections, climate change is likely to add to population movement in Asia \nand the Pacific. \n \n7.  The  interaction  between  environmental  change  and  migration  is  poorly  understood, \nalthough the implications for migration\u2014within countries and across international borders\u2014\ncould be enormous. The consequences of climate change on human population displacement \nare complex, hard to predict, and hindered by a lack of baseline data and unclear projections of \npopulation  growth,  but  a  substantial  need  to  support  large-scale  migration  is  nevertheless \nanticipated. \n \n8.  There has been relatively little empirical research on the topic for Asia and the Pacific. It \nis very difficult to estimate how many people may move, or to determine their likely origins or \ndestinations. Information on international migration is particularly poor, and current information \ndoes not provide a basis for realistic projections of future international mobility levels. \n \n9.  The impact of climate change on populations will be influenced by (i) the nature and \nseverity of the climate change, and (ii) by the ability of populations to bring resources to bear to \nadapt to such change. The broader socioeconomic vulnerability of populations in the climate \nchange hot spots is therefore significant.  \n \n10.  Despite the region\u2019s tremendous growth, many people still live in poverty;7 they have \nlimited resources for adaptation, and their wellbeing remains highly vulnerable to environmental \nhazards and natural resource degradation. \n \n11.  The bulk of forced climate change-induced migration will involve poor people who will be \nthe  most  vulnerable  to  climate  change  impacts.  Most  resettlement  will  occur  within  poor \ncountries.  Landlessness,  homelessness,  socioeconomic  marginalization,  food  and  health \ninsecurity, and loss of belonging are some of the most important effects of displacement due to \nclimatic changes. The needs of migrants will include permanent shelter, energy and water \nsupplies, sanitation, and school and health facilities; there will also be a need for a diverse \nrange  of  adaptable  livelihood  security  opportunities,  capacity-building  of  national  and  sub-\nnational government entities, and relocation and settlement services. If these risks are not \naddressed  adequately,  they  may  result  in  chronic  vulnerability  and  increased  social  and \neconomic marginalization of already disadvantaged social groups.  \n \n12.  Current financial mechanisms for climate change adaptation are limited, however, and \nare not sufficient to address the growing need to cope with the uncertainties of displacement. \nMoreover, large-scale migration is not taken into account in most national adaptation strategies. \nIn the event of a climate-induced migration, a sizeable financing facility will be required.  \n \n13.  There is an urgent need for the development of appropriate policies, institutions, and \nmechanisms to help target intervention strategies. Major improvements will be required in many \n                                                 \n7  ADB estimates 903 million people live on $1.25 per day. \n ", "  3\nareas\u2014more  effective  migration  management,  stronger  governance,  development  of \nappropriate funding mechanisms, enhancement of international cooperation on climate change \nissues, expansion and improvement of development assistance mechanisms, and development \nof sound economic development policy and practice throughout the region. These changes \nrequire substantial institutional, structural, and cultural change, and will require considerable \nlead time. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n14.  This  regional  research  and  development  TA  will  undertake  studies  to  improve \nunderstanding of climate-induced migration in selected developing member countries (DMCs) \nand  subregions.8 Analysis  will  be  undertaken  and  policy  recommendations  developed  with \nrespect  to  the  economic  and  sociopolitical  consequences  of  climate-induced  migration; \ninstitutional, capacity and resource gaps; and the feasibility of a financing mechanism to support \nthe costs of climate-induced migration. Information dissemination campaigns to raise awareness \nand share the results of the studies, complementing the communications plan of ADB's Climate \nChange Program, will also be undertaken. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the TA is reduced vulnerability of DMCs from the impacts of climate-\ninduced migration. The expected outcome is enhanced capacity and improved understanding of \nthe  impacts  and  action  required  to  address  climate-induced  migration.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will have the following outputs: (i) country and subregional studies to improve the \nempirical basis for policy and planning on climate-induced migration, (ii) a feasibility study on \noptions to finance needs related to climate-induced migration, (iii) regional dialogues and policy \nrecommendations to address climate-induced migration, and (iv) awareness-raising activities \nand regional workshops on the conclusions of the TA. The activities to achieve the outputs are: \n \n1.  Output 1: Country and Subregional Studies to Improve the Empirical Basis \nfor Policy and Planning on Climate-Induced Migration \n(i)  Follow-on studies in countries and subregions. Building on the findings of the \nrecently  concluded climate  change  and  migration  study,  the  TA  will  conduct \njoint,9 subregional, and country studies in identified hotspots on the major drivers, \nlikely impacts, potential needs and possible policy measures to address climate-\ninduced migration, by (a) examining past experience, patterns, and distinguishing \n                                                 \n8  In the course of the climate change and migration study, consultations with a number of DMCs and regional \ndepartments indicated a need for and interest in pursuing follow-on studies in the Mekong Delta, Indonesia, \nselected urban areas in the Philippines and Viet Nam, areas around the Aral Sea in Central Asia, Papua New \nGuinea, and a number of island nations in the Pacific. The final list will be determined during TA implementation, \nfollowing additional consultations. \n9  Partnerships with the United Nations University, the Secretariat for the Pacific Commission, the International \nOrganization for Migration, International Committee of the Red Cross, and ADB regional operations departments \nwill be explored to support the studies. Collaboration with be undertaken with two ongoing TA projects: ADB. 2009. \nTechnical Assistance for Strengthening the Capacity of Pacific Developing Member Countries to Respond to \nClimate  Change.  Manila;  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  for  Regional  Partnerships  for  Climate  Change \nAdaptation and Disaster Preparedness. Manila. \n ", "4   \nfeatures among the drivers of migration; and (b) identifying barriers and actions \nto address these.  \n(ii)  Tracking  and  monitoring  migration. Building on past and ongoing work of \nother  partners,  the  TA  will  (a)  examine  current  means  of  displacement  and \nmigration data collection, tracking, and monitoring, and recommend measures for \nimprovement; and (b) where possible, review distinctions between climactic and \nnon-climactic factors affecting migration in order to isolate or correlate the causes \nof migration.  \n(iii)  Tool development. The TA will undertake an analysis and prepare tools for \nreplication in other hotspots, including: (a) socioeconomic analysis, examining \npotential social, economic and financial implications of climate-induced migration \nin selected countries in the region and the costs and benefit of adaptation and \nresettlement  or  temporary  movements;  (b)  gap  assessments  on  capacity, \ngovernance,  infrastructure,  service  delivery  and  adaptable  livelihood \nopportunities  of  DMCs,  communities  and  civil  society  organizations  in  both \nrecipient and origin territories, and the financing requirements to address the \ngaps;  (c)  risk  assessment,  reviewing  adaptation  policies  and  measures,  and \nbuilding in a framework for assessing climate, other hazards and risk mapping in \nhotspots, recipient and sending countries or territories and identifying adaptation \npolicies and measures to minimize disruptions and negative impacts of large-\nscale migration in regional or country frameworks on climate change.  \n(iv)  Options for development. The TA will review past resettlement experience and \ndraw lessons appropriate for climate-induced migration, exploring a range of \nsettlement options for displaced populations (staying in camps, integration with \nlocal populations in destinations, joining relatives, etc.) as well resettlement or \nreturn options.  \n \n2.  Output  2:    Feasibility  Study  on  Financing  Facility  and  Mechanisms  for \nOperation \n(i)  Financing options. The TA will undertake a comprehensive feasibility study for \nthe expansion of existing funding facilities (including the Adaptation Fund of the \nKyoto Protocol and the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund) or \nthe establishment and maintenance of a new funding facility. This includes a \nreview of current initiatives, and proposing areas of collaboration, synergy and \n(where appropriate) expansion. A review of other financing modalities\u2014e.g., risk \ninsurance, adaptation funds, and use of remittances as a source of development \nfunds\u2014will also be undertaken.  \n(ii)  Mechanism for operation. The TA will  review existing mechanisms for fund \nsourcing,  including  major  principles  and  mechanisms  of  burden  sharing  to \nestablish financing facilities, and propose procedures and structures, including \nregarding: trustees, trust management, major donors and stakeholders (including \ncivil  society  organizations,  public  and  private  sectors),  replenishment, \ndisbursement  criteria,  triggers  for  fund  use,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  the \nprojected principal needed, and the level of annual contributions required to \nmatch future needs. \n \n3.  Output 3:  Regional Dialogues and Policy Framework Development \n17.  The TA will sponsor bilateral, regional, and international dialogues on the status and \nprotection of climate-induced migrants in the context of the policy dialogues under climate \n ", "  5\nchange implementation plan processes. It will also examine international immigration policy, \nnational adaptation strategies and international legal instruments in selected regions, DMCs, \nand developed countries, and identify potential processes, instruments, adaptation policies and \nmeasures appropriate for climate change-induced migration, including how agreements can \ninclude provisions on assistance and protection. Based on this review, it will develop and \npropose agreements, policies, and frameworks addressing climate-induced migration and the \nstrengthening of existing mechanisms on migration.  \n \n4.  Output 4:  Awareness Raising and Information Dissemination \n18.  A  communications  and  dissemination  plan  that  makes  use  of  multimedia  will  be \nprepared to raise awareness in both potential recipient and origin territories. The findings of the \nTA will be disseminated through awareness-raising campaigns and conferences attended by a \nrange of stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $700,000. The TA will be financed by the ADB \nClimate Change Fund on a grant basis. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. It will be implemented over 12 months \n(January\u2013December 2010). ADB\u2014through the Climate Change Program Unit, in collaboration \nwith the Poverty Reduction, Gender, and Social Development Division of the ADB Regional and \nSustainable  Development  Department\u2014will  be  responsible  for  overall  management  and \nmonitoring of TA activities. Throughout the TA implementation, the Climate Change Program \nUnit  will  closely  consult  with  regional  departments,  resident  missions  concerned,  and \nimplementation partners. At least three country or regional hotspots will be included in the TA.10 \nA  no-objection  in  writing  will  be  obtained  before  commencing  or  financing  any  proposed \nactivities in the territory of the participating DMCs. The progress and outputs of the TA will be \nposted and regularly updated on the ADB climate change and social development websites.  \n \n21.  The TA will require an estimated total of 31 person-months of consulting services (5 \ninternational consultants with expertise in climate change economics, national and international \nmigration, financing, social development and public information for a total of 19 person-months \nand 12 person-months of national consultants with similar expertise as that of the international \nconsultants). International consultants, in coordination with development partners and regional \noperational departments, will lead the studies, dialogues, and awareness campaigns. National \nconsultants will provide support to the international consultants. All consultants will be engaged \nby ADB as individuals in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \nThe Poverty Reduction, Gender, and Social Development Division will set up an external and \ninternal review and advisory panels for the project during the course of the TA. \n \n                                                 \n10 These studies, spread across ADB operational subregions, will be selected in consultation with operations \ndepartments on the basis of potential risks and demand and the existence of partner institutions.  \n ", "6   \nIV.
