In February 1994 the Government of Western Samoa confirmed a request for\ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Bank to undertake an institutional strengthening study for the\ncountry's Electric Power Corporation (EPC). A Bank mission visited Western Samoa in\nNovember 1994 and reached an understanding on the TA with the Government and EPC. The\nTA is included in the Bank's 1994 Western Samoa Country Operational Program1.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Independent State of Western Samoa comprises the two main islands of\nUpolu (to the east) and Savai'i (to the west) with only about 15 km separating the two. Five\nsmaller islands make up the group. The two larger islands are tropical, mountainous, and\ndensely vegitated in the interior. The largest town and the country's administrative center is\nApia, located about midway along the northern coast of Upolu. The country's population of\nabout 160,000 depends predominantly on agriculture, which, with other economic activities and\na substantial remittance flow from emigrants, support a GNP per capita of about US$600 per\nannum. Large scale emigration, mainly to New Zealand and the United States, is responsible\nfor the severe shortage of skilled and experienced managers, professsionals, and craftsmen.\n3. The country depends on biomass for about 65 per cent of its energy and on\npetroleum imports and electricity generation for its commercial energy needs. Petroleum\nproducts account for one third of energy usage and electricity generation makes up the balance\nof 3 per cent. Western Samoa has no known petroleum reserves and its relatively substantial\nhydropower resources are constrained by low dry season capability and limited storage\navailability.\n4. The responsibility for public electric power generation and distribution in the\ncountry rests with EPC which was established under the EPC Act of 1972 and is wholly\ngovernment owned. It is governed by a Board chaired by the Minister of Public Works. Other\nBoard members represent consumers, educational bodies, commerce, and the church. EPC is\nmanaged by a General Manager (a Western Samoan national), a Deputy General Manager, a\nPlanning Engineer, and a Generation Engineer, all of whom are foreigners with salaries financed\nor supported through multilateral and bilateral aid.\n5. EPC maintains power generation and distribution facilities on Upolu and Savai'i.\nUpolu, by virtue of its higher population and more advanced state of development, has the\nlargest power system. It has an installed capacity of about 15.9 megawatts (MW), made up of\n8 MW diesel capacity and 12.2 MW hydroelectric. On Savai'i, diesel generation is relied on\nexcept for a wood-waste (dendrothermal) power plant, utilizing material from a nearby saw mill,\nlocated on the western-most extremity of the island, near Asau. Power distribution is by 33-\nkilovolt (kV), 22 kV and 6 kV primary lines, and service is at 415/240 volts. Peak power demand\nin the Upolu system in November 1994 was 9.85 MW, and energy generation for the past 12\nmonths, 49,500 MWh. In Savai'i, the correspanding figures were 1.1 MW and 4,800 MWh.\n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  as Institutiona' Support for EPC in November 1994.", "6. Diesel generation on Upolu is provided from Tanugamanono power station on the\noutskirts of Apia. The station has an installed capacity of about 10.9 MW, which has been\ndownrated, because of age and technical reasons, to an available capacity of about 8.0 MW.\nSeveral run-of-river hydopower stations have been develped over the years with Bank and other\nmultilateral and bilateral financing. These total 6.9 MW of capacity. The largest are Fale-ole-Fee\n(1.74 MW), Samasoni (1.9 MW), Sauniatu/Lalomauga (3.7 MW), and Aba (1 MW). In May\n1994, the only storage hydroelectric project which has todate been identified as feasible, was\ncommissioned. The Afulilo scheme, with an installed generating capacity of 4 MW, is estimated\nto be capable of generating 24 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of energy per annum once fully\noperational. In the dry season, total hydropower generation peak capability drops from 12.2 MW\nto about 6.5 MW, with Afulibo, the only storage scheme, providing most of this capacity.\n7. In the past several years, EPC has had difficulty maintaining its hydro and diesel\ngenerating plant. The cause of the problem may lay in the less-than-optimum organizational\nstructure of EPC, its mix of professional staff, its salary structure, and a lack of professional\nexpertise and experience. To boost the strength of professional staff, EPC has recruited foreign\nstaff for certain senior management positions. The study will (i) determine if the staff expertise\nis in the correct proportion, (ii) determine if the structure of EPC is impeding its operations, and\n(iii) investigate other institutional matters. EPC has recently commissioned local consultants to\ndesign a computerized plant maintenace system. This has been necessitated by the\nunsatisfactory plant maintenance history of EPC in the past five-years, which has been a\nprincipal cause of plant breakdown, including the failure of its most important hydroelectric\ninstallations. The TA will assist EPC to install a first stage basic maintenance system, based on\nthe local consultants' recommendations, upon which EPC will progressively expand in future\nyears to incorporate all desired functions.\n8. Since the commissioning of the Afulilo hydroelectric scheme in July 1993, EPC\nhas operated a mix of storage hydropower, run-of-river hydropower and diesel generating units.\nHowever, little attention is given to efficiency, and no efficiency aids are in place to assist the\noperation of these plants or conservation of hydro storage to take into account seasonal rainfall\nvariations or system conditions. The study will develop computerized aids for EPC's operational\nstaff to more economically operate its hydropower and diesel plant. Furthermore, operation of\nthe Afulilo scheme has indicated that seepage through the reservoir assumed in all project\npreparatory studies appears to be not as great as anticipated and additional water resources are\ntherefore now available. This may justify the immediate installation of a third 2-MW turbine\ngenerator in the scheme's Taelefaga power station.\n9. EPC's Upolu system demand has grown significantly in the past 12 months, in\nexcess of the projected 5 per cent average annual growth rate. In November 1994, a new large\nresort hotel/casino development was announced and at least one other similar development on\nUpolu is possible. This may produce demand increases of up to 1 MW in the present 10-MW\nsystem, and require the immediate consideration of dry season generation expansion for the\nsystem. Planning studies for this expansion are urgently needed followed by a feasibility study\nfor the recommended first stage project.", "[CI\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n10. The TA will provide institutional support to improve EPC's managerial, financial,\nand operational efficiency. Additionally, the TA will assist EPC in planning and preparing its next\nphase of its generation development program, and in improving the reliability and efficiency of\nits transmission system.\nB.\t Scope\n11. The TA will recruit of a team of international consultants who, together with the\nsupport of counterpart staff from EPC, will study the following six components (detailed terms\nof reference are shown in Appendix 1).\n1.\t Institutional Support\n12. The study will review EPC's institutional structure to determine weaknesses and\nimpediments in carrying out its functions. In particular, its management structure will be\nexamined, especially the balance of professional expertise and the staff resources needed to\ncarry out EPC's administration, planning, financial control, and operations functions.\n2.\t Plant Maintenance System\n1 3.lnadequate and irregular plant maintenance, together with a deficient stock of spare parts,\nhave been a primary cause of the collapse of much of the Upolu generating plant in the past\nyears. The collapse has incurred enormous losses to EPC and the country's economy. Local\nconsultants have recommend that EPC install a comprehensive computerized plant maintenance\nand overhaul system that includes spare parts inventory control and purchasing systems. The\nTA will assist EPC in procuring and installing the first stage of a plant maintenance system.\n3.\t Upolu Transmission Study\n14. Studies are being arranged separately by EPC to upgrade its transmission system,\nespecially to eliminate distribution transformers from main trunk lines. The TA will provide a\nsmall amount of financing to purchase a suitable (for small systems) computer program to permit\nEPC to carry out its own system performance studies.\n4.\t Afulilo Augmentation\n15. Provision was made in the Afulilo scheme for a third 2-MW turbine-generator at\na later stage. Better-than-expected hydrological conditions (see para. 8) have provided the\nprimary justification for the installation of the extra machine. Also, a pumping scheme from a\nriver on a downstream catchment (the Vaipu project) can increase the Afulilo discharge. Further\nstudy of these two schemes is provided for under the TA. Because of dry season limitations,\nEPC needs to increase storage generation capability.\n..\t . \n-\t -\t -\t - eace.JL 1L11. \u2022\tfl V,JV_L,J._L_J\u2022t_J_V.V .f,-l?.\ttlt!

EPC's long-term generation development program was studied in 1991 under TA\nNo. 1311-SAM 1. With the Afulilo hydrological developments and the proposed associated\nstudies under the TA, EPC's development program needs to be updated. This is now an urgent\nrequirement because two resort hotel developments are currently being planned. The TA will\nupdate the earlier planning study and undertake a feasibility study for the first stage generation\ndevelopment. With limited dry season generation capability, this project is expected to be a\nthermal project.\n6. Generation Optimization/Watershed Management System\n17. The operation of EPC's generation facilities is becoming increasingly complicated,\nwith its plant now consisting of a mix of storage hydropower, run-of-river hydropower and diesel\nunits. Each requires different operating criteria: maximize utilization of run-of-river hydropower;\nconserve to the extent possible storage hydropower; and minimize diesel generation. The tools\navailable for the relatively inexperienced Samoan plant operators are insufficient to guarantee\nconformance to such operating rules. The TA will cover studies, and procurement of a small\namount of computer equipment, to provide a simple computer-based operating system and\nguidelines to ensure the optimal economic operation of the Upolu plant.\nC.\t Cost Estimate and Financing Plan\n18. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $367,000, $350,000 of which will be in\nforeign exchange and $17,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will provide $350,000 to\ncover the full foreign exchange costs. EPC will finance the local costs of $17,000. Detailed TA\ncost estimates are shown in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n19. The TA will be undertaken by a firm of international consultants that will be\nselected in accordance with the Bank's Guideilnes on the Use of Consultants. The Mission\nestimates that the study will require 11 .5 person-months of consulting services. The Executing\nAgency for the TA will be EPC. The study will be implemented over a period of six months. The\nconsultants will produce an interim report after the initial three months of their services (Phase\n1). The report will be utilized, during a study review period of one month, as a basis for\ndecisions on the direction to be taken for the two-month final phase (Phase 2) of the study. The\nconsultants will submit a draft final report at the completion of Phase 2 and a final report\nincorporating comments of EPC/Government and the Bank on the draft report. The final report\nwill define a project on which the Bank may appraise a loan to the Government for the country's\npower subsector.\n1 Power System Planning Study for EPC, approved on 5 June 1990.", "5\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n20. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, to be financed on a grant basis, to the\nGovernment of the Independent State of Western Samoa in an amount not exceeding the\nequivalent of $350,000 for the purpose of the Institutional Support and Power Development Study\nfor the Electric Power Corporation, and hereby reports his action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1\nPage 1\nTerms of Reference\nA.\t Scope of Services\n1. The principal tasks to be undertaken by the consultants to be recruited under the\nTA are as follows:\n1.\t Corporate Strengthening\n2. The aim of this section of the study is to determine weaknesses in EPC's corporate\nstructure, managerial balance, and capabilities of the Electric Power Corporation and its financial\nand technical planning and control functions.

Generation Optimization Management Studies\n3. This section of the study will develop computer-based system rules and\nguidelines, as well as the specifications of operational and control aids in order to ensure that\nthe various hydropower and diesel generating units in EPC's Upolu system operate in the most\nefficient manner to meet seasonal and system operating conditions. The consultants will:\n(i) review present status and planned rehabilitation plans for all diesel generating\nunits in the Upolu system; gather operational limitation information on all units;\nand detail or calculate, if necessary, the fuel efficiency of each unit;\n(ii) review unit control, protection, and indication facilities and other station\ninstrumentation facilities for each unit;\n(iii) review the present status and planned rehabilitation of all hydropower stations,\nexamine operational or load limitations of each station/unit, and review governor\ncharacteristics of each unit;\n(iv) review control room facilities at each station to determine the adequacy of control\nand indication instrumentation, and of data logging facilities for vital conditions of\neach station and set, including headpond/storage reservoir conditions;\n(v) review and recommend improvements in each hydropower and diesel station for\nthe control of each unit and/or station; recommend provision or improvements in\ndata logging facilities, including data transmission facilities, to integrate data into\none data base at one central station; recommend personal computer-based or\nother system, including software to accommodate the requirements and those\nbelow;\n(vi)\t devise guidelines for the most efficient operation of the generating units especially\nto maximize run-of-river hydropower generation, and conservation of", "8\nAppendix 1\nPage 3\nstorage hydropower when seasonal conditions require; devise spinning/standby\nreserve rules; and specify rules for reactive load control utilizing, to the extent\npossible, hydro units to minimize diesel operation;\n(vii) review the present load sharing techniques and recommend plans for an\nintegrated control of load/frequency to allow better balance of loading according\nto plant rating, and review the present underfrequency protection system and\nrecommend ammendments and/or additions; and\n(viii) conduct on-the-job training of EPC operating staff on this plant management\nsystem.\n3. Plant Maintenance System\n4. The objective is to provide assistance to EPC to install a basic plant maintenance\nsystem that was studied and recommended in 1994 by Smith Systems of Apia. Assistance will\nbe given to procure computer equipment and programs, within the financing provided under the\nTA, and to assist EPC in the installation and development of the system. The consultant will:\n(i) review reports and recommendations of the plant maintenance system\nconsultants;\n(ii) assist EPC in the selection of required basic computer system hardware and\nperipherals including, where necessary, communications and interfacing\nequipment, for a first phase system;\n(iii) review availability of suitable software to provide the required and recommended\nfacilities and performance;\n(iv) assist EPC in procuring the selected hardware and software including\nspecifying systems and software, preparing procurement documents, and\nconducting bid analysis/contract negotiation; and\n(v) assist EPC to install the hardware and software, assist in data collection and\ninput, and develop the system to the stage where EPC staff may continue to\ndevelop the system with minimal external assistance.\n4. Generation Development Studies\n5. Two studies will be completed to determine the next thermal and/or hydropower\ngeneration projects for the Upolu system taking into account developments since the\ncommissioning of the Afulilo hydro storage scheme. The aim is to build on the findings and\nrecommendations of the GibbAustraliastudy (TA No. 1311-SAM: PowerSystem Planning Study)\nto incorporate rehabilitation works recently completed on diesel and hydropower schemes and", "Appendix 1\nPage 4\nto factor in the hydrological performance of Afulilo. Recent large load development\nannouncements require new generation studies which are in advance of the timing anticipated\nby Gibb and other recent studies, and the completion of a feasibility study on the recommended\nfirst expansion project. The consultants will perform the following tasks, which are listed under\nthe two studies:\n(a)\t Hydropower\n(I) review the hydrological performance of Afulilo scheme since commissioning;\nreview previous hydrological studies for the project;
