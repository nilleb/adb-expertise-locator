In December 2002, the Government of Kazakhstan requested technical assistance (TA) \nfor  developing  a  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PM&E)  system  for  government \nprograms.  Programming  missions  and  missions  related  to  the  Governance  Assessment \nundertaken by Asian Development Bank (ADB) were fielded.1 An ADB Fact-Finding Mission \nduring 25 June\u201310  July  2003  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA \nobjectives, scope, and implementation arrangements.2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The development programs of the republican budget of Kazakhstan are divided into \nstate  and  sector  programs.  State  programs  are  aimed  specifically  at  addressing  national \nstrategic priorities and development needs. They are approved by the President and can cut \nacross  sectors.  Sector  programs  are  related  to  the  development  of  specific  sectors  or \nsubsectors of the economy and are approved by the Government. Currently there are 14 state \nprograms and 43 sector programs, covering the activities of all line ministries and agencies. \n   \n3.  Over the last few years, the Government has initiated a number of reforms to improve \nthe program development and budget formulation process. The Rules for Development of \nPrograms in the Republic of Kazakhstan (Rules for Program Development) was adopted in \n2000. Its primary objective was to rationalize and streamline programs and bring them in line \nwith the medium and longer-term priorities outlined in the Government\u2019s Strategic Plan of \nDevelopment  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  until  2010  and  Strategy  of  Development  of \nKazakhstan until 2030. Subsequently, the Government undertook an extensive review, and \neither merged or canceled several programs that had overlapping functions and those that \ndeviated from longer-term development needs. A better balance in the distribution of programs \nacross sectors was also achieved. \n \n4.  In  January  2002,  the  Government  amended  the  Rules  for  Program  Development, \nmaking requirements for program approval significantly more stringent. All program proposals \nare now required to submit program \u201cpassports,\u201d outlining program goals and performance \nindicators, and detailing the amounts and sources of funds (republican budget, loans, foreign \nand local investment, external grants, etc.) for the duration of the program. Programs also need \nthe Republican Budget Commission\u2019s approval before being approved by the President or the \nGovernment.  \n \n5.  While these initiatives provide a good basis for improving program performance, a lot \nmore needs to be done. The quality of information provided by line ministries and agencies in \nprogram \u201cpassports\u201d and evaluation reports thus far has not been  satisfactory. In particular, \nperformance measurements either are not specified, are inappropriate, or are submitted without \ncomparative benchmarks. This makes it difficult for central agencies to effectively monitor and \nassess program performance. \n \n6.  The President recently underscored the need for further reforms by issuing a decree: \nRules of State Program Development and Implementation in the Republic of Kazakhstan (Rules \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  Kazakhstan  for  the  Governance  Study  and  Capacity  Building  for \nAdministrative Reform. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in March 2003. ", "2 \nof  State  Program  Development,  Presidential  Decree,  No.  1099,  June  2003).  The  Decree \nstipulates that state programs that duplicate the objectives of ongoing programs will not be \napproved, and requires that all programs be based on clearly defined goals and performance \nindicators, and monitored regularly. It also outlines the main criteria for program evaluation: (i) \nefficient use of human and financial resources (ii) achievement of stated goals and targets and \n(iii) social and economic impact.  \n \n7.  Although the decree was originally directed at state programs, the Government plans to \napply the Rules for State Program Development to both state and sector programs. Accordingly, \nthe Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning (MEBP) has taken over the responsibility for \ndeveloping strategy and methodology for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of all  programs.  \nMEBP aims to address two key and related weaknesses. First, line ministries and agencies lack \ncapacity and incentives for effective M&E of programs they administer. Programs are either \nevaluated  on  the  basis  of  inadequate  and  inappropriate  criteria,  or  not  evaluated  at  all.  \nMoreover, the central authorities have yet to establish a mechanism for systematic and regular \nM&E of programs, and for incorporating performance criteria in funding decisions.  Programs \nare typically evaluated only when specific problems arise during implementation, or when \nexpenditure  limits  are  breached.  As  a  result,  underperforming  and  low-priority  programs \nsometimes continue to be approved, while potentially more effective ones may be denied \nfunding.   \n \n8.  To make efficient use of budgetary resources, and to improve the quality of public \nservice delivery, the Government has requested ADB assistance for developing a PM&E system \nfor government programs. The system will be pilot-tested in the Ministry of Education (MOE) \nand Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), to include a program each in the social sector and the \nproduction sector.  These ministries were selected in consultation with MEBP, and based on \ncapacity considerations. The specific programs for implementing of the PM&E system will be \ndetermined during the Inception Mission. The lessons learned from this pilot project will enable \nthe Government to develop a strategy for promoting wider and effective use of PM&E systems \nin government programs.  \n \n9.  In 2001 ADB prepared the Technical Assistance Performance Audit Report on Selected \nTechnical Assistance for Strengthening Evaluation Capacity in Developing Member Countries \n(TPA: OTH 2001-07).  Key lessons outlined in this report include the following: (i) high-level \nownership of and commitment to performance evaluation, clearly demonstrated by budget and \nstaff allocation, and status within the institutional hierarchy are crucial; (ii) incentive-compatibility \nissues need to be adequately addressed, and building capability with primary focus on the \ncentral oversight agency may weaken incentives for other entities to provide performance \ninformation; and (iii) care needs to be taken that PM&E systems do not become too complex \nand resource-intensive to sustain. These recommendations will be taken into account when the \nTA is formulated and implemented. \n \n10.  The purpose of this TA is in line with the strategic objectives of ADB assistance to \nKazakhstan, and serves to complement previous and ongoing activities in the country. During \n2001-2002 ADB provided assistance (TA 3595-KAZ)3 to strengthen government capacity to \nformulate and implement sound public investment programs (PIPs). The objective was to \ndevelop  an  effective  planning  framework  by  establishing  strong  links  between  the  central \nagencies, line ministries, and local governments, and to strengthen the PIP procedure by \ndeveloping specific guidelines for project submission and improving the process for project \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2000.

A  follow-up  small-scale  TA  (TA  4046-KAZ)4  is  supporting  the \ndevelopment  of  a  database  management  system  to  incorporate  information  requirements \nstipulated  by  the  Government\u2019s  revised  public  investment  programming  and  approval \nprocedures. An ongoing TA (TA 4072-KAZ)5 is helping the Government develop meaningful \ntarget indicators for poverty reduction, and a system for monitoring the indicators at the national \nand local levels. The TA aims to help the Government meet the poverty reduction goals of the \nState Poverty Reduction Program. The Governance Assessment (footnote 1) conducted by \nADB  has  highlighted  the  need  for  further  improvement  in  program  monitoring  and \nimplementation, and proposes ADB support in this area.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to strengthen the performance of government programs in \nKazakhstan. To this end, the TA will develop and pilot-test a PM&E system in MOE and MOA. \nThe lessons learned from the pilot cases will enable the Government to develop a strategy for \nwider implementation of PM&E  systems in government programs. Outputs will include (i) a \nPM&E system incorporating methodologies for internal and external evaluation and (ii) capacity \nbuilding for effective implementation of the PM&E system. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The key activities for achieving the outputs follow. \n \n  1.  Develop PM&E System \n \n13.  This output will entail these activities. \n \n(i)  Review current procedures for program M&E in Kazakhstan against international \nbest practice, assess capacity and resource constraints, and identify areas for \nimprovement. \n \n(ii)  Design an internal evaluation system that will clearly indicate the success and \nfailure of programs in relation to stated goals and objectives. This will involve \nidentifying  meaningful  qualitative  and  quantitative  indicators  that  measure \nprogram outcomes and impact, as well as monitor progress over time. The \ninternal  evaluation  system  will  include  guidelines  for  self-assessment  of \nprograms, including annual and end-of-program reports.  The system will also \nprovide a coherent linkage between review activities at all levels and the overall \ndecision-making,  planning,  and  management  systems  of  the  respective \nMinistries. \n \n(iii)  Design a small-scale survey of target beneficiaries of the selected programs. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.
