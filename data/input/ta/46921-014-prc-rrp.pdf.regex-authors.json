I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof CNY600 million (or its equivalent in US dollars) to the Longjiang Environmental Protection \nGroup Share Company Limited (LJEP) for the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and \nManagement Project Private Sector Facility, Phase 2 in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  The project is the second phase of the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and \nManagement Project Private Sector Facility,1 which is part of a broader multiproject initiative \nunder the East Asia Department and the Private Sector Operations Department of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to address acute water stress in the Songhua River basin (SRB) of \nnortheastern PRC.2  \n \n3.  Approved on 16 April 2010, phase 1 assists LJEP through (i) an equity investment of the \nlesser of $10 million or 15% of total paid-up equity capital, (ii) an A-loan of up to CNY250 \nmillion, and (iii) a B-loan of up to $100 million.3 Phase 1 supports LJEP\u2019s investment plan to \nbuild,  acquire,  upgrade,  and/or  expand,  and  then  operate  wastewater  treatment  plants \n(WWTPs) and water supply utilities. Equity and A-loan funds are fully disbursed and performing, \nbut the B-loan has been delayed by conditions in international financial markets.4   \n2.  Project Design \n4.  The project builds on the success of phase 1 by supporting LJEP in broadening its \ninvestment plan. The project is thus conceived as parallel assistance to LJEP that avoids \noverlap with phase 1.  \n \n5.  Sludge management. The PRC faces intensifying environmental and public health risks \nfrom untreated sludge, the waste byproduct of sewage treatment. Despite the country\u2019s recent \nprogress in expanding wastewater treatment, capacity for sludge treatment, disposal, and reuse \nremains severely underdeveloped.5 Most wastewater operators simply thicken sludge, minimally \ndewatering it before disposing of it in landfills. The resulting waste, high in water content, \noccupies scarce landfill capacity, contaminates groundwater and land, and emits greenhouse \ngases without control. The Government of the PRC has identified sludge management as an \nurgent development need and is promoting investments in treatment and disposal. The Twelfth \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Equity Investment \nand Loan for the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management Project Private Sector Facility in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Songhua River Water Quality and Pollution \nControl Management. Manila (TA 4061-PRC, approved on 19 December). The TA assisted the government in \ndeveloping its long-term SRB pollution clean-up program. This program has been supported by a series of urban \nprojects under ADB\u2019s East Asia Department and by phase 1 of the proposed project. \n3  The phase 1 borrower, Tongfang (Harbin) Water Engineering, was renamed LJEP in 2010. \n4  ADB\u2019s $10 million in equity financing was fully invested in April 2010. The CNY250 million A-loan was fully \ndisbursed in December 2010 and is currently outstanding. ADB\u2019s B-loan is not yet effective. \n5  Less than 25% of the country\u2019s WWTPs are adequately equipped to condition, stabilize, and dewater sludge to \nremove  pathogens,  eliminate  offensive  odors,  and  reduce  waste  volume.  Fewer  still  transform  sludge  into \nresources for agricultural, construction, or fuel applications. ADB. 2010. Promoting Beneficial Sewage Sludge \nUtilization in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. ", "2    \nFive-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 introduces the concept of technical routes for sludge treatment, \npromotes low-carbon approaches to sludge management, and sets the national goal of treating \n80% of sludge in large cities and 70% in small cities by 2015.6 Together, these policies establish \nnew national standards for sludge treatment and mandate local government implementation. \nThe 12th plan also envisions 10% of the CNY380 billion budgeted for the wastewater sector \nbeing used to address sludge. The government will soon require all new WWTPs to incorporate \nsludge treatment capability and will regulate treatment levels according to plant size.7 \n \n6.  Wastewater  treatment  plant  effluent  emissions  standards. In addition to volume \ntargets for wastewater treatment, a feature of past plans, the 12th plan calls for raising quality \nstandards. It states that by 2015, the PRC will reduce effluent chemical oxygen demand by 8% \nfrom  2010  levels,  nitrate  emissions  by  10%,  and  ammonia  nitrogen  emissions  by  10%. \nAccordingly, tighter effluent emission standards are being phased in for all WWTPs, subject to \nplant technology and location. To induce upgrades, the government has implemented higher \ntariffs for WWTPs meeting higher standards. \n \n7.  Songhua River basin. The SRB is the third largest river basin in the PRC, after those of \nthe Yangtze and Yellow rivers, with an area of 557,000 square kilometers and a population of \n62 million.8 The SRB is acknowledged by the government as one of the five most polluted river \nbasins in the country. Known and suspected contaminants include a number of trace organic \nchemicals and metals, as well as conventional pollutants. Significant portions of the river have \nquality categorizations of class IV or V, meaning the water is unsuitable for municipal domestic \nuse. In response, the government has made improved water quality and responsible utilization \npriorities in the SRB\u2019s plan, targeting class III water quality for the entire basin by 2020. ADB \nhas  supported  these  goals  through  multiple  loan  and  technical  assistance  projects  with \nprovincial governments in the SRB. \n3.  The Borrower and/or Sponsor \n8.  LJEP, the borrower, is the leading provider of wastewater treatment and related services \nin Heilongjiang. The company was founded in 2004 under the original name Tongfang (Harbin) \nWater Engineering.  \n \n9.  LJEP\u2019s  business  model  is  to  operate  WWTPs,  water  supply  systems,  and  related \ninfrastructure in the SRB. Projects are typically public\u2013private partnerships under build-operate-\ntransfer or transfer-operate-transfer concessions. LJEP operates 15 WWTPs with a combined \nprocessing capacity of 1.97 million t/d and two municipal water utilities with 680,000 t/d of \ntreatment and delivery capacity.  \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n10.  Impacts.  The  project  has  two  related  impacts.  First,  the  project  will  contribute  to \nimproved water quality and public health for urban residents in the SRB. Upgrading WWTPs will \ndirectly  support  the  government\u2019s  policy  of  tightening  environmental  standards  for  urban \nwastewater, improving water quality, and reducing public health risks. Second, the project will \ncontribute  through  its  demonstration  effect  to  increased  private  sector  investment  in \n                                                \n6  State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2012. The Master Plan for National Urban Wastewater Treatment \nand Recycling Facilities Under the 12th Five-Year Plan. Beijing (19 April). \n7  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Environmental Protection. 2010. Notice on Reinforcing Municipal Water \nTreatment Plant Sludge Pollution Prevention and Control. Beijing (26 November). \n8  The Songhua River catchment covers portions of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces and of the Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region. ", "    3 \nenvironmental infrastructure in second- and third-tier cities in the PRC.9 As the first major \ninvestment program in Heilongjiang for treating and disposing of sludge, the project will serve as \na model for future sludge projects in the water-short northern PRC. The approach of scaling up \na  high-performing  private  sector  firm,  while  cofinancing  with  international  banks  through \nunfunded  risk  participation  (URP),  has  strong  demonstration  effects  for  private  sector \ninvestment in PRC urban infrastructure and potential for replication in other developing member \ncountries of ADB.  \n \n11.  Outcome. The investment will improve sludge and wastewater management in project \ncounties in Heilongjiang. Capacity to treat effluents to a higher standard will be improved, as will \ncapacity to safely treat sludge. The project will not only improve sludge treatment, but the \nconversion of sludge into fertilizer for urban landscaping will underscore the viability of reusing \nsludge as a resource. \n \n12.  Output. The project will expand capacity for wastewater and sludge treatment. Other \nsocioeconomic benefits from the investment, captured in the design and monitoring framework, \ninclude  job  creation  at  WWTPs  and  sludge  facilities  and  spending  on  local  goods  and \nservices.10 Municipalities covered by the project will benefit from a package of unquantified \nbenefits that includes improved environmental services, capital investment, and technology and \nmanagerial expertise. \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n13.  Consistency with Strategy 2020. The project supports two of the five core operational \nareas of Strategy 2020: infrastructure and environment.11 Regarding infrastructure, the project is \nconsistent with the strategy\u2019s urban infrastructure focus on water supply, sanitation, and waste, \nas well as with its emphasis on public\u2013private partnership and private sector engagement. \nRegarding the environment, the project mitigates water pollution and health threats arising from \nurbanization and economic growth. \n14.  Consistency with country strategy. By supporting inclusive growth and environmental \nsustainability, the project directly addresses two of the three development goals of the PRC \ncountry partnership strategy and aligns with the country partnership strategy\u2019s affirmation of \nnatural resource and urban development as priority sectors.12 It strongly complements ADB\u2019s \ncurrent initiatives in water pollution control and wastewater treatment in the PRC. The project \nwill be the fifth component of a comprehensive and integrated river basin management strategy, \ninitiated  in  2002,  which  includes  private  and  public  sector  operations  to  improve  the \nmanagement of water supply, wastewater, and solid wastes in the SRB.13 It builds on ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n9  Recognizing the potential of private sector capital and expertise to improve municipal water and wastewater \nservices, the government is aggressively promoting public\u2013private partnership. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 ADB. 2008.

Consistency with ADB sector strategy and operations. The project is an example of \nthe type of intervention envisaged by ADB's Water Financing Program, 2011\u20132020, which \npromotes water as a core investment area and raises ADB\u2019s water investment target to $2.5 \nbillion a year, or $25 billion by 2020.15 It aligns with ADB's Water Policy, which recognizes that \nremedies to water stress must include reversing the degradation of water resources caused by \nagricultural, industrial, and municipal effluents.16 Similarly, the Water Operational Plan, 2011\u2013\n2020  identifies  wastewater  management  and  reuse  as  a  key  operational  focus  in  rapidly \nindustrializing countries like the PRC.17 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  LJEP will centrally control all subproject development, procurement, and financing. For \neach subproject, a feasibility study, environmental and social assessments, audit reports and \nplans, and project design will be prepared by LJEP, approved by local governments, and \nreviewed by ADB prior to financing. Table 1 summarizes implementation arrangements.18 \nTable 1: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nContractual framework  Subprojects will be structured as build-operate-transfer concessions with \nmunicipal governments, for which concession rights are awarded through \npublic tendering or bilateral negotiation with underlying competitive \nselection. Subprojects will be implemented in accordance with granted \napprovals and, during construction and operation, subject to government \ninspections of operational and environmental performance. \nManagement  LJEP management has considerable capability with wastewater, a track \nrecord of 15 wastewater treatment plants under operation, and additional \nmanagerial and financial support from THHC as needed. \nOperations arrangements    \nRevenue and cost  The concessions will include provisions for metered inflow and outflow \nstructure  volumes, contracted minimum offtake quantities, and regulated tariffs. In \naccordance with national tariff guidelines, tariffs will be set on a cost-plus \nbasis, including the costs of treatment, taxes, and specified rates of \nreturn. Costs of treatment include capital expenditure and direct expenses \nfrom wastewater or sludge treatment (including electricity, chemicals and \nother materials, and maintenance). \nOperation and  LJEP will manage project implementation, operation, and maintenance as \nmaintenance  part of its 25- to 30-year concession obligations. \nRelevant parties  Subprojects will be owned and operated by LJEP or its subsidiaries. \nFinancial, operational, and managerial support is available from THHC. \n                                                                                                                                                       \nDevelopment Project.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n17.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance is a loan of up to CNY600 million (or its equivalent in US \ndollars). It will carry an interest rate, commitment and front-end fees, and URP fees approved by \nADB\u2019s investment committee. ADB will enter into an URP agreement with eligible commercial \nbanks for at least CNY300 million (or its equivalent in US dollars) of the commitment.  \n \n18.  LJEP  will  act  as  borrower  and  direct  ADB  funds  to  subprojects  in  several  cities. \nSubprojects will be held either directly through LJEP or through special-purpose subsidiaries. \nRepayment will rely primarily on the cash flows from LJEP\u2019s portfolio of both new and existing \nsubprojects.  \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n19.  Catalyzing  private  sector  participation. The project provides a  pioneering private \nsector wastewater operator with access to needed finance, which is difficult to obtain from local \nbanks because of their relative inexperience in the sector and perceptions that private sector \nborrowers are riskier, or from international banks because of volatility in financial markets. In \naddition, the URP mobilizes cofinancing in an area with little international bank participation to \ndate.  \n  \n20.  Project  innovation.  The  project  combines  several  features  innovative  in  PRC \ninfrastructure finance. It is structured as a multiproject loan facility, in effect bundling small- and \nmedium-sized  subprojects  to  avoid  the  high  transaction  costs  associated  with  stand-alone \nproject financing and to diversify risk. In addition, ADB\u2019s loan will be provided in local currency, \nusing renminbi sourced from ADB\u2019s renminbi-denominated bond proceeds. \n \n21.  Demonstration  effects.  Through partnership with a highly competent operator, the \nproject will demonstrate how sludge and WWTP upgrade investments can be commercially and \ntechnically viable. Further, ADB\u2019s requirements will ensure that LJEP operates according to best \ninternational  practices  and  adheres  to  high  standards  of  corporate  governance  and \nenvironmental  and  social  protection,  serving  as  a  model  for  the  industry.  Finally,  ADB\u2019s \nexperience with the project can meaningfully contribute to the dialogue on wastewater sector \nmanagement and regulation in the PRC and the region. \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is category B \nfor  environment.  LJEP  has  established  an  environmental  and  social  management  system \n(ESMS) under phase 1. For phase 2, a corporate audit of LJEP\u2019s performance in implementing \nits ESMS was undertaken by independent consultants. The audit found the ESMS adequately ", "6    \naddressing  ADB\u2019s  environmental  safeguard  requirements  and  LJEP\u2019s  environmental \nperformance satisfactory. LJEP undertakes extensive and real-time environmental monitoring, \nmonthly reporting, and annual performance audits. To date, LJEP has complied with national, \nprovincial, and local environmental requirements and maintained ISO 14001-2004 certification.  \n \n34.  Subprojects are located at existing sites in suburban areas designated for industrial use, \nso land acquisition will be minimal. Hence, with respect to involuntary resettlement the project is \ncategory B, while for indigenous peoples the project is category C. The corporate audit found \nthat  LJEP\u2019s  due  diligence  is  limited  to  determining  whether  the  local  government  has \npossession of the land in accordance with national laws. Audits of two potential subprojects \nfound  that  compensation  implemented  by  the  local  government  complies  with  ADB\u2018s \nrequirements.  \n \n35.  Other social dimensions. LJEP upholds gender equality, provides equal benefits and \ntraining  opportunities  for  all  staff  members,  and  strictly  follows  national  labor  laws  and \nregulations.. LJEP will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy19 and report regularly to \nADB on compliance\u2014including that of its contractors\u2014with national labor laws consistent with \ninternationally recognized core labor standards.  \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n39.
