The Government of Nepal requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA)1 to establish effective micro-irrigation service delivery systems to the \npoorest and most disadvantaged groups\u2014including ethnic minorities, dalits (low occupational \ncastes), women, marginal farmers, and landless families\u2014to back up the Community-Managed \nIrrigated Agriculture Sector Project (CMIASP).2 Following the endorsement of the concept note \nby the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund in November 2004, ADB fielded a fact-finding \nmission  in  January 2005,  and  consulted  with  representatives  of  the  Government,  external \nfunding agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and beneficiaries; and agreed with the \nGovernment on the TA design, including the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nepal remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita annual income of \n$241 in 2003. Poverty is highly concentrated in rural areas, in particular among disadvantaged ethnic \nminorities (about 36% of the population) and dalits (about 13%). Nepalese society is governed by \ntraditional rules and behavioral norms embedded in ethnic and caste systems, within which upward \nmobility is limited and women are disadvantaged. Along with social exclusion, these marginalized \ngroups have limited access to natural resources and economic opportunities. They remain as landless \nor marginal farmers operating on most unproductive land, with little public development service \nreaching them. The continued socioeconomic inequality is one of the root causes of the recent violent \ninsurgency. Enhancing the capacities and incomes of these poorest excluded groups is one of the \nmost critical challenges for the country.  \n3.  Agriculture remains the most important source of livelihood for the rural poor, providing \nemployment for over 80% of the active workforce and meeting their nutritional needs. The \ncountry offers unique opportunities for smallholders to produce a wide range of high-value \nagriculture products on a commercial basis. However, the sector is still largely dominated by \ntraditional, subsistence-oriented crop farming. Key constraints include difficult terrains; poor \ninfrastructure;  low  technology  base;  and  limited  access  to  inputs,  output  markets,  and \nsupporting  services.  The  Tenth  Plan  (FY2003\u20132007),  which  is  the  Government\u2019s  poverty \nreduction strategy paper (PRSP), adopted in 2003, has accorded highest priority to agriculture \nand  rural  development  and  provided  a  comprehensive  framework  building  on  the  1995 \nAgriculture Perspective Plan (APP), with emphases on (i) progressive involvement of the private \nsector in input and output marketing, (ii) coordinated provision of critical public infrastructure and \nservices, (iii) partnership with private providers (including NGOs), and (iv) devolution of services.  \n4.  Due to the highly uncertain rainfall pattern in Nepal, irrigation is an essential input to a \nmodern production system, and is prioritized in PRSP and APP as a foundation to this end. \nAbout 1.13 million hectares (ha) of the country\u2019s net cultivated area of 2.64 million ha has \naccess to irrigation, among which farmer managed irrigation systems (FMIS) account for 55%. \nDespite  their  community-based  sustained  maintenance,  productivity  of  FMIS  remains  low \nbecause of fragile diversion and rudimentary distribution structures. Following the priorities set \nout in the Irrigation Policy (2004),3 the CMIASP was prepared to improve the performance of \nexisting FMIS in the Central and Eastern Development regions, while setting up sound service \ndelivery mechanisms and furthering sector policy and institutional reforms. CMIASP has also \nincluded  the  promotion  of  innovative  unconventional  micro-irrigation  systems,  to  support \nlivelihood enhancement in rainfed areas that cannot benefit from FMIS improvement.   \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 3 March 2005.  \n2  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project. Manila. \n3  Department of Irrigation. 2004. Irrigation Policy 2060. Kathmandu. ", "2   \n5.  In  recent  years,  micro-irrigation  has  emerged  in  Nepal  as  an  appropriate  solution \nadapted  to  small  farm  size,  land  fragmentation,  and  high  labor  to  land  ratio.  Low  cost \ntechnologies have also progressively developed. Available micro-irrigation technologies in the \nhills include drip and micro sprinkler (both through pipes connected to a bucket kit) that are \nconnected to existing community water supply systems or harvesting tanks, whereas those in \nthe terai (alluvial plain) include treadle pumps, tubewells, and dug wells. Individual household-\nbased  kits  and  equipment  are  affordable  to  and  manageable  for  smallholders,  including \nmarginal farmers.4 However, their meaningful innovation and adaptation started only in the mid-\n1990s by NGOs such as the International Development Enterprise; Center for Environment and \nAgriculture  Policy  Research,  Extension,  and  Development;  and  Support  Activities  for  Poor \nProducers  (SAPPROS).  In  2003,  Winrock  International, an  international  NGO,  initiated  the \nSmallholder Irrigation Market Initiative, which aims to promote drip, sprinkler, and treadle pump \nirrigation to 27,000 farm households through a farmer demand campaign and equipment supply \nchain development in West and Midwest Development regions.5 With inevitable positive impacts \non the livelihood of rural smallholders\u2014and using locally accepted NGOs as service providers\u2014\nthese programs are being implemented effectively under the present insurgency conditions.  \n6.  Available experience and lessons of micro-irrigation in Nepal have indicated substantial \ngains among micro-irrigation adopters, particularly through vegetable growing: (i) gross income \ngains of NRs3,500\u2013NRs4,500 per year (with just 0.01\u20130.02 ha of cropping); (ii) improved dietary \nstatus from increased intake of vegetables; and (iii) time and energy savings, with an overall \ninternal rate of return of well over 300\u2013500% (in case of adapters having access to water \nwithout source development and delivery).6 The technology, downsized in scale and cost, suits \nsmall and marginal farmers\u2019 needs in water scarce areas. It is particularly suited to women \nfarmers as it builds on their existing farming practices in vegetable gardening, given that about \n90% of women are engaged in agriculture compared with 64% of men. Drip and sprinkler \nirrigation has also proven to be environmentally sound, with (i) increased water use efficiency \nestimated at 90% compared with 20\u201330% under surface irrigation, and (ii) improved soil fertility \nthrough soil loosening and increased moisture with reduced soil erosion. Finally, necessary kits \ncan be delivered with sustained after care services by establishing private sector supply chains. \n7.  While 70,000 farmers use treadle pumps in the terai and 20,000 use drip and sprinkler \nirrigation in the hills across Nepal, micro-irrigation development is still at a very early stage, which calls \nfor concerted pioneering efforts to deliver a package of necessary services before rapid growth in \ntechnology adoption takes place. There are vast opportunities to promote the ready adoption of the \ntechnology in areas with existing water supply systems or water sources nearby. On the other hand, it \nis more challenging in areas that have little access to water, where support for community efforts is \nneeded to set up water acquisition facilities to connect to drip equipment, such as hybrid systems for \nwater supply-cum-micro-irrigation. Most critically, benefits to date have primarily accrued to upper poor \ngroups that were able to purchase the drip system and commensurate agro-seed-fertilizer package, in \nresponse to aforementioned program\u2019s focus on developing private market mechanisms. This has \nexcluded the poorest and most marginal farmers, especially disadvantaged women, ethnic minorities, \nand dalits in water stress areas, despite the good opportunities now offered by low-cost technologies \nas an entry point towards social and economic integration. (Lessons learned are shown in Appendix 4).  \n8.  The  Government  has  set  a  target  of  developing  10,000  ha  under  unconventional \nirrigation  systems  (including  micro-irrigation)  in  the  Tenth  Plan,  and  intends  to  prepare  a \n                                                 \n4  A standard small bucket-based drip irrigation system (for 250 square meters of land) costs in NRs1,000, with an \nannual operation and maintenance cost of NRs300. The cost of a treadle pump system is about NRs1,500.  \n5  ADB also undertook a small pilot drip irrigation demonstration in 2003 with the use of the Water Cooperation Fund \nfrom the Government of the Netherlands, with a focus on poor women\u2019s groups in a western hill district. \n6  Tushaar, Shah and Jack Keller. 2002. Micro-irrigation and the Poor: A Marketing Challenge in Small-holder \nIrrigation Development. Available: http://www.siminet.org/images/pdfs/mi-and-the-poor.pdf. ", "  3\nnational  policy  for  micro-irrigation.  In  this  context,  there  is  a  need  for  (i)  exploring  and \ndocumenting available technologies; (ii) defining institutional arrangements and responsibilities \nof the relevant organizations, including those of local government institutions (LGIs); and (iii) \ndefining suitable financing arrangements. The Government is of the view that the delivery of \nmicro-irrigation kits and support services should be done through private providers, while the \npublic sector should focus on (i) facilitation, coordination, and field level monitoring; and (ii) \npolicy formulation, programming, and technical backstopping at the central level. These need to \nbe clearly stipulated in line with the Government\u2019s decentralization policy.   \n9.  There is also a high need to define and operationalize effective mechanisms to deliver \nthe services to the poor\u2014in particular disadvantaged ethnic or caste women\u2019s groups, which \nhave  not  benefited  from  existing  programs\u2014by  exploring  necessary  incentives  such  as  a \npromotion grant and no-interest revolving fund; and careful beneficiary identification, motivation, \nand  extension.  This  should  also  be  pursued  with  strengthening  of  the  capacities  of  the \nresponsible organizations for effective program delivery, covering (i) farmer awareness and \ngroup mobilization, (ii) private sector supply chain of micro-irrigation equipment and spare parts, \nand (iii) supporting services for agriculture extension and marketing. The TA is needed to meet \nthese immediate needs. Its implementation will also follow the approach proven effective under \ninsurgency conditions, i.e., program delivery through locally accepted NGOs and private agents, \nalong with direct targeting of the most disadvantaged groups. Its successful implementation will \npave the way for effective targeting of the poor in implementing the relevant subcomponent of \nthe CMIASP while providing a model for wider program replication across Nepal towards rapid \ntechnology adoption by poor smallholders and landless sharecroppers and renters.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA is reduced extreme poverty and marginalization among the most socially \nand economically deprived households in the TA project areas, which covers five districts in three \nclusters, comprising two adjacent hill and two adjacent terai districts in the Central Development \nregions, and one hill district in the Eastern Development region. Its outcome is the development and \ndemonstration of effective delivery mechanisms of micro-irrigation support services to socially and \neconomically excluded ethnic minority and dalit groups, which will be further implemented in CMIASP \nwith a more pro-poor focus. TA outputs include (i) micro-irrigation delivery mechanisms operative in \nthe TA area with at least 2,500 poor households operating micro-irrigation, and (ii) draft policy and \nimplementation guidelines for promoting micro-irrigation for the poorest. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  To establish and put into operation the appropriate delivery and support mechanisms for \nthe poorest, the TA will take a flexible approach of starting with best practices and adapting to \nlessons learned. Services will be provided through local NGOs with the facilitation and technical \nbackstopping of line departments and LGIs, with the overall capacity strengthened support by \nthe consultants. The activities include (i) establishing operational procedures with training; (ii) \nprogram delivery through group formation, water acquisition as necessary, micro-irrigation, and \nagriculture extension; and (iii) TA project management and institutional support.    \n12.  Operational Procedures and Training. The TA will (i) start with documenting existing \nprograms,  their  impacts,  and  lessons;  and  (ii)  prepare  operational  procedures  and \narrangements, including the roles of parties concerned. This will be followed by training of line \nagencies, including the Department of Irrigation (DOI), Department of Agriculture (DOA), district \nagriculture development office (DADO), district technical office, district development committees \n(DDCs),  and  village  development  committees  (VDCs),  along  with  NGOs.  Local  training \n ", "4   \ninstitutions will also be trained to impart training as trainers for this purpose. Delivery will \nenvisage  (i) private  service  provision  with  facilitation  and  technical  backstopping  by  public \norganizations,  (ii)  synergy  with  ongoing  agriculture  sector  programs  assisted  by  external \nfinanciers,7 and (iii) progressive devolution of program delivery responsibility to DDCs.    \n13.  Program Delivery Targeted to Most Vulnerable Groups. This component will include \n(i) an awareness campaign, and formation and training of micro-irrigation groups; (ii) delivery of \nmicro-irrigation; and (iii) agriculture support services. The selected NGOs will implement the \nactivities, targeting disadvantaged people, including ethnic minority, dalits, and women with less \nthan 0.05 ha landholdings. Each group will organize themselves with three main responsibilities \nunder leader farmers, including (i) building technical capability for micro-irrigation agriculture \npractices and sustainable operation and maintenance; (ii) developing themselves as viable \ncommunity-based organizations to pursue community interests with a collective approach; and \n(iii) communicating with local bodies, implementing NGOs, project agencies, and other private \nparties associated with agriculture input and output marketing.   \n14.  The TA will provide about 2,500 households\u2014organized by groups of a minimum of \n10 families willing to develop high-value vegetable or cash crops\u2014with micro-irrigation facilities. \nThe program will focus primarily on areas with some water sources nearby, such as village \nwater supply systems, but a small number of water acquisition facilities will be developed as a \npilot project. The cost of micro-irrigation equipment will be supported through a promotion grant \nand interest-free loans8 to facilitate the poorest people\u2019s participation. The TA also supports \ndeveloping  supply  chains  for  equipment  and  spare  parts  with  training  of  manufacturers, \nwholesalers, and retailers. Farmer groups will be further provided with agriculture extension and \nfacilitation of output marketing through local NGOs, supported by DADO.9  \n15.  TA Management and Institutional Strengthening. The TA will support the program \ndelivery management and capacity strengthening of DOI, DOA, DDCs, VDCs, and NGOs in \nterms of technical backstopping, coordinated technical service delivery, and facilitation. TA \nprogress and impacts will be monitored regularly using a simple set of outcome, impact, and \nprocess indicators. Some core indicators will be selected from the poverty monitoring analysis \nsystem linked to the PRSP. These will be properly recorded and documented, along with the \nlessons learned under the TA, and will be shared among the implementing agencies, key \nstakeholders, and external funding agencies through a series of workshops and seminars. On \nthe basis of these activities, the TA will support the preparation of a draft policy for micro-\nirrigation development and guidelines for implementation, including the consultative process \ntowards finalizing the documents, with active stakeholder participation. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000 equivalent, of which $450,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund administered by ADB. \nThe  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $100,000  equivalent  by \nproviding office accommodation, two DOI vehicles for the consultants and NGO, counterpart \nstaff, and other expenditures. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n                                                 \n7  Including APP support program assisted by the Department for International Development. \n8  Up to NRs500 per household and less than 50% of cost as grant, and up to NRs1,000 per household as loans. The \nrecovered fund will be used by the NGO to provide follow-on services to the farmer groups after TA completion, \nfollowing a separate memorandum of agreement to be signed by the NGO, the Government, and ADB for due fund \nmanagement. The TA consultants will facilitate the process and arrange for necessary training.  \n9  The resettlement framework, environmental assessment procedures and arrangements, and sample indigenous \npeople\u2019s specific action plan for the CMIASP will be followed, as applicable, in implementing this component.    ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  DOI will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall TA management, coordination \n(including policy issues), and technical aspects of water acquisition and delivery. DOA will work as \na co-executing agency responsible for on-farm micro-irrigation equipment, crop extension, and \nmarketing facilitation. DOI will assign the head of its unconventional irrigation unit as TA manager, \nand  DOA  will  assign  a  managerial  staff  member  in  the  agriculture  extension/engineering \ndirectorate as co-manager. A working group headed by the director general of DOI will be formed \nto  guide  TA  implementation,  including  the  preparation  of  a  draft  policy  and  implementation \nguidelines, with the participation of line departments concerned, including DOA, DOI, Department \nof Women Development, Department of Water Supply and Sanitation (DWSS), and key NGOs \nand research organizations active in micro-irrigation.10 Field activities will be managed by district-\nlevel subproject management units following the CMIASP design and comprising managerial staff \nof the irrigation development division, DADO, and DDC.  \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 20 months from May 2006 to December 2007. A \nqualified team of consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants \nand NGOs. Given the demonstration nature of the work that calls for the best qualified staff to \ndevelop and operate effective service delivery and supporting mechanisms, the consultants will \nbe engaged individually by ADB. The TA requires a total of 17 person-months of domestic \nconsultants, who will also organize an external advisory group comprising international experts \nbased in Kathmandu, to review and advise on the TA  outputs.11 ADB will also engage a \nqualified national NGO associated with local NGOs through ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nselection  and  biodata  proposal  procedure.  Specific  field  services  will  be  provided  through \nassociated local NGOs. The outline terms of references of the consultants and national NGO \nare  in  Appendix  3.  The  consultants,  in  association  with  the  NGO,  will  prepare  inception, \nquarterly progress, and final reports. The TA will also use an advance payment facility to \nsupport the incremental operational cost of the line departments. The advance will be credited \nto the account number in Nepal Rustra Bank provided by DOI, which will establish and maintain \nall statements of expenditures. The DOI account will be audited through the Auditor General\u2019s \nOffice, and audited financial statements and accounts, together with the report of the auditor, \nwill be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the close of each financial year.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 to the Government of \nNepal to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for Economic and \nSocial Inclusion of the Disadvantaged Poor through Livelihood Enhancement with Micro-irrigation, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n10  In this context, DWSS and DOI will jointly prepare a guideline for the hybrid micro-irrigation-cum-water supply \nsystems appropriate for the hill regions. ADB will also join the working group as an observer.   \n11  Limited international consultant input is justified given the availability of a model to establish a private supply chain \nof micro-irrigation, and the experience and capacities of NGOs to follow such model and implement group \nformation, motivation, and services targeting the poorest people.   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  And Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nReduced extreme poverty  Improved livelihood of the  \u2022 Impact and outcome  Similar projects are \nand marginalization  disadvantaged population  monitoring system  implemented nationwide \namong the most socially  under extreme poverty  established at the  following the TA outputs \nand economically  targeted under the PRCF,  beginning, based on  demonstrated. \ndeprived households in  measured by (i) improved  multilevel indicators \nfive districts of Nepal  HDI; (ii) increased level of  from the initial baseline \n  food security; and  survey \n(iii) increased financial,  \u2022 Semiannual ADB review \ncapital, and skill assets,  missions \nby 2008    \u2022 Quarterly progress and \nTA completion reports \nby the consultants \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nDevelop and demonstrate  The following results  \u2022 Process, impact, and  Local security conditions \neffective implementation  indicators will be achieved  outcome monitoring  are conducive to operate \nmechanisms and local  by 2008:  system of the TA  the service delivery \ncapacities to deliver  \u2022 Incremental annual  \u2022 External poverty impact  mechanism.  \nmicro-irrigation support  family income of over  assessment   \nservices to socially and  NRs3,000  \u2022 Semiannual ADB review  Implementation \neconomically excluded  \u2022 Household food deficit  missions  arrangement is supportive \nethnic minority and dalit  months are halved  \u2022 Quarterly progress and  to the innovative grant \n(low occupational castes)  \u2022 Household financial and  TA completion reports   mechanism. \ngroups  skill assets are     \n  improving over time in    DOI, DOA, MLD, and \nterms of HDIs    DWD at central and \n\u2022 Most disadvantaged    district levels are \ngroups in the lowest-   committed to poverty \nincome quintile in the    reduction of marginalized \nlocality participate in the    groups\u2014including low \nprogram as a majority    castes and ethnic \nof beneficiaries    groups\u2014with gender \n\u2022 Level of confidence    consideration. \ntoward development     \ninitiatives is improved     \n     \nThe following institutional  (Same as above)  Services and funds are \nproperly and timely \nindicators will be achieved \ndelivered to beneficiaries, \nby 2008: \nin accordance with grant \n\u2022 Effective delivery \nprinciples. \nmechanisms for the \n \npoor are demonstrated \nEfficient grassroots \n\u2022 Draft policy and \nmonitoring and \nguidelines for micro-\ncommunication/feedback \nirrigation are developed \nsystem will guide the \n\u2022 Mechanism is duly \nprocess. \noperating CMIASP \n   \n\u2022 Replication will be \npursued in other ADB- \nand donor-assisted \nprojects ", "Appendix 1  7\nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  And Risks \nMechanisms \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.

Specific lessons learned through earlier micro-irrigation interventions are as follows:1 \n(i)  Micro-irrigation technologies are adapted to the increasing fragmentation of farm \nholdings of Nepal and to the low level of financial and technical assets of poor \nfarmers, to improve both capital (land and crop) and labor (profit) productivity, and to \nsave time (compared with manual watering), water (increase water use efficiency), \ntopsoil (less run-off and more progressive percolation) and fertilizer (crop specific \napplication and better controlled destination). \n(ii)  Micro-irrigation  technologies  can  benefit  marginalized  and  very  poor  groups, \nincluding ethnic groups, low castes, and women-headed households.  \n(iii)  With micro-irrigation, farmers tend to adopt more inputs such as fertilizer, improved \nvarieties, and pesticides, and are able to increase the value of their production \nthrough bari land (traditional rainfed upland) intensification (from 100% to 250%), \nyield increase (+ 25\u201335%), and crop diversification. \n(iv)  When landholding size is bellow 0.05\u20130.08 hectares (ha) per household member, \nmicro-irrigation  may  not  bring  notable  change  in  the  economic  status  of  the \nhousehold, but will improve the family\u2019s food security (food quality and security of \nharvest), and capital and labor productivity.  \n(v)  When  landholding  size  is  above  0.1  ha  per  family  member,  adopters  of  micro-\nirrigation develop a high-value cropping system with the sale of the surplus to local \nmarkets, and some are able to switch from a survival strategy to an accumulation \nstrategy (poverty reduction). \n(vi)  For marginalized rural groups living in chronic poverty, financial assistance, in terms \nof  collateral-free  low  interest  loan  or  subsidy,  is  needed  to  meet  their  upfront \ncontribution. \n(vii)  To promote micro-irrigation for poverty reduction on a wider scale, four factors have \nto come together: (a) national policy for the promotion of micro-irrigation technologies \n(for  small  landholders  and  marginal  farmers);  (b)  identification,  adaptation,  and \napplication of appropriate micro-irrigation technologies (research and development \napproach with Government, institutes, and nongovernment organizations [NGOs]); \n(c)  financing  for  the  implementation  of  these  technologies;  and  (d)  institutional \narrangement for the implementation of these technologies.  \n(viii)  In rural areas, development practices should target robust mobilization of the people. \n                                                 \n1 These are extracted from (i) Human Resource Development Center. 1999.
