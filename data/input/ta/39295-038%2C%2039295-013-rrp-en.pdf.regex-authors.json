THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the additional financing of the Third Urban Governance \nand Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project. \n \n2.  The current project1 supports strengthening urban governance  and improving urban \ninfrastructure and service delivery in pourashavas (municipalities)2 by investing in pourashavas \nbased on their governance improvement performance. The additional financing will expand the \ncurrent project, which is performing well, by supporting (i) additional priority infrastructure and \ngovernance improvements in pourashavas covered by the current project, and (ii) infrastructure \nand governance improvements in five more pourashavas.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Urban  development  challenges  of  pourashavas.  While  Bangladesh\u2019s  economy \ncontinues to grow at a healthy pace,4 the government needs to focus on achieving sustainable \nand inclusive growth while addressing the challenges of rapid urbanization. In 2015, only 32% of \nthe urban population had piped water supply and 58% of the urban population had access to \nimproved  sanitation  facilities. 5  Although  sanitation  coverage  is  improving,  fecal  sludge \nmanagement remains a major challenge, especially in urban slums. Drainage is underdeveloped \nand poorly maintained, resulting in frequent water logging. Many urban roads are dilapidated \nbecause of increasing traffic and lack of maintenance. Solid waste management is not systematic, \nand open dumping creates public health risks. The urban challenges are even more acute in \npourashavas  because  of  inadequate  governance,  capacity  constraints,  lack  of  community \nparticipation, and sustainable infrastructure deficiencies.6 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas supported infrastructure and governance improvement in pourashavas through the first and \nsecond  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  (Sector)  Projects. 7  Although \nimprovements have been made through these earlier projects, pourashavas still need significant \ninvestment to enhance municipal infrastructure service delivery, strengthen urban climate change \nresilience, and reduce regional disparities across the country.  \n \n4.  Performance-based  incentives  for  governance  improvement.  With  limited  but \neffective incentives for pourashavas to improve their governance, the first project introduced a \nperformance-based fund allocation strategy through the Urban Governance Improvement Action \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for the Third Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project. Manila. \n2  Bangladesh defines pourashavas per the level of own-source annual revenues, with class A being the highest. As of \nJune 2017, the country has 328 pourashavas (class A: 162, class B: 106, and class C: 60). \n3  Project preparation and due diligence was done under the current project loan and a technical assistance grant by \nthe Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under ADB\u2019s Urban Financing Partnership Facility. (ADB. 2015. \nTechnical Assistance for Promoting Urban Climate Change Resilience in Selected Asian Cities. Manila). \n4  Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  World Health Organization. 2015. Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation: 2015 Update. New York. \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Other Urban Infrastructure and Services (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n7  The first project (2003\u20132010) provided a loan of $65 million to support 27 pourashavas. The second project (2008\u2013\n2016) provided a loan of $87 million and cofinancing of $40.8 million equivalent to support 51 pourashavas. Major \ninfrastructure achievements under both projects include rehabilitation or new construction of 1,665 kilometers (km) \nof urban roads, 424 km of drains, 44 km of piped water supply, 7 solid waste disposal sites, and 82 municipal facilities. \n ", "2 \nProgram  (UGIAP),  effectively  supporting  governance  reforms. 8  This  shaped  the  Local \nGovernment (Pourashava) Act (2009) and other urban development projects supported by ADB \nand  development  partners. 9  Under  the  first  and  second  projects,  targeted  pourashavas \nsignificantly improved their governance performance while receiving investments to meet their \ninfrastructure needs.10 Major project governance achievements included (i) the establishment of \ntown  coordination  and  ward  committees,  supporting  citizens\u2019  participation,  including \nrepresentation of women and the poor; (ii) the development and implementation of gender action \nplans (GAPs) for pourashavas; (iii) computerization of tax and accounting records; and (iv) \nincreased local revenue generation.11 \n \n5.  Strengthening urban climate resilience. Climate change is a critical development issue \nfor Bangladesh. Major climate risks for pourashavas include rising temperature, higher intensity \nand frequency of rainfall and wind loads, storm surges, and riverine flooding. Rising sea levels \nmay affect pourashavas in coastal zones and intrude inland, increasing the salinization of both \ngroundwater and surface water. Pourashavas will need to enhance their institutional abilities to \nsustain operation and maintenance (O&M) of infrastructure and services, specifically increasing \nthe resilience of poor and vulnerable people. \n \n6.  Lessons  learned.  Lessons  from  earlier  projects  suggest  that  (i)  governance-led \ninfrastructure  improvement  has  worked  well,  (ii)  the  use  of  a  sector  lending  modality12 is \nappropriate for a multicomponent project with performance-based fund allocations through a \nphased approach, and (iii) good quality and front-loaded capacity building and strong institutional \nsupport  is  required  for  pourashavas.13 Thus,  the  overall  project  (current  project  including \nadditional financing) adopts the sector lending modality.14 Capacity building support was provided \nduring project preparation and continues during implementation. \n \n7.  Current  project  design.  The  current  project15 supports  pourashavas  through  two \nschemes.  The  first  scheme,  called  window  A,  provides  infrastructure  funds  and  capacity \ndevelopment support for governance improvement in 30 pourashavas with a total population of \n2.2 million. The support is provided in three phases based on compliance with UGIAP criteria.16 \n                                                \n8  The UGIAP for the current project covers (i) citizen awareness and participation, (ii) urban planning, (iii) gender \nequality and social inclusion, (iv) local resource mobilization, (v) financial management and accountability, (vi) \nadministrative transparency, and (vii) keeping essential pourashava services functional. \n9  ADB:  Secondary  Towns Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (Bangladesh), and  Local  Governance \nEnhancement Sector Project (Sri Lanka); World Bank: Municipal Governance and Services Project (Bangladesh); \nJapan International Cooperation Agency: Inclusive Governance Project (Bangladesh).

Manila. \n11 Under the second project, local revenue generation was increased by $4 million (106%) for holding tax and by $11.5 \nmillion (129%) for non-holding tax at the end of the project, compared with baseline figures. \n12 In earlier projects the sector lending modality contributed to a significant improvement in urban development and \nmanagement, and initiated several institutional and sectoral reforms, including the Local Government (Pourashava) \nAct (2009) and the draft National Urban Policy. \n13 ADB. 2014. Validation Report: Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project in Bangladesh. \nManila. Overall validation rating is successful. \n14 Sector Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15  Loan 3142-BAN (footnote 1), an Asian Development Fund loan of $125 million equivalent (now concessional loan \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources as of 1 January 2017), approved by the ADB Board on 17 July 2014, became \neffective on 4 November 2014; Loan 8285(OFID) for $40 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development \n(OFID) became effective on 9 April 2015. ADB administers procurement and disbursement under the OFID loan. \n16 With fulfillment of entry criteria by all 30 window A pourashavas, priority subprojects have been supported (phase 1). \nBased on substantial progress of such investments and compliance with intermediate criteria, additional subprojects \nare being implemented (phase 2) in all window A pourashavas. Meeting the advanced criteria and progress on the ", "3 \nThe second scheme, called window B, allocates funds based on well-defined performance criteria \non a competitive basis to all remaining pourashavas in the country. Funding of up to $2 million for \ninfrastructure improvement will be provided to each of the top 20 pourashavas in the governance \nassessment, which will be conducted twice during implementation.17 \n \n8.  Demand for expanding the current project\u2019s successful model. In the government\u2019s \nSeventh Five-Year Plan, urban development is a national priority to reduce urban poverty and \nimprove living conditions through better city governance and service.18 Given the successful \nperformance of the current project and the government\u2019s request to include five additional \npourashavas under window A,19 additional financing of $200 million was included in the latest \ncountry operations business plan.20 \n \n9.  The proposed additional financing will cover (i) the shortfall from the underestimation of \nthe investment requirements under the current project21 to enable the continued financing of (a) \npriority infrastructure and governance improvements in 30 window A pourashavas, and climate \nand disaster resilience aspects22 under output 1; and (b) infrastructure support for qualifying \nwindow B pourashavas under output 2; and (ii) the scaling up of the current project by (a) \nsupporting additional activities under output 1 and (b) adding five window A pourashavas. \n \n10.  Additional financing eligibility criteria. The additional financing meets ADB\u2019s eligibility \ncriteria.23 The overall project (i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially \nsound; (ii) is accorded high priority by the government; and (iii) is consistent with the current \nproject\u2019s  development  objectives,  the  government\u2019s  priorities,  and  the  country  partnership \nstrategy,  which  prioritizes  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  governance \nimprovement, and climate- and disaster-resilient infrastructure and services. The current project \nhas been rated on track since it started, and implementation progress and results are satisfactory. \nAs of 15 June 2017, with 45% of project time elapsed, contracts worth $94.55 million (84% of \nLoan  3142-BAN)  and  disbursement  of  $50.38  million  (45%  of  Loan  3142-BAN)  had  been \nachieved. Overall physical progress stands at 54% overall. 24 The current project has complied \nwith safeguard requirements and adequately managed risks. Project readiness for additional \nfinancing is high. The overall project will contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 1125 and is \nin line with ADB\u2019s urban operational plan.26 \n \n                                                \nearlier phases 1 and 2 subprojects will make window A pourashavas eligible for investment support in phase 3. As \nallocations of less than $3 million per pourashava for infrastructure improvement under earlier projects was \ninadequate to meet the demand, window A pourashavas will receive more substantial investment under the overall \nproject, depending upon need and absorption capacity. \n17 For window B, a separate set of UGIAP criteria using objective and measurable governance indicators has been \nprepared. Based on the first assessment in August 2016, the top 20 pourashavas selected are receiving infrastructure \ninvestment assistance under the current project. \n18 Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015.

Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2017\u20132020. Manila. \n21 The design of the current project envisaged additional financing. Additional financing is even more critical as all 30 \nwindow A pourashavas have performed well, meeting the intermediate criteria for phase 2. \n22 Project preparation, which followed an integrated, consultative process to mainstream climate change adaptation \nand mitigation in pourashavas included (i) climate risk and vulnerability assessments for wards; (ii) updates of urban \nmaster plans, incorporating climate and disaster risks and priority interventions; (iii) capacity building; and (iv) \nfeasibility studies for priority subprojects, including climate-responsive engineering designs. \n23 ADB. 2011.

The outcome will be municipal service \ndelivery and urban governance in project towns improved.27 The current and aggregated outcome \ntargets as a result of the additional financing are in the revised design and monitoring framework \nin Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Based on the reasons for the proposed additional financing (para 9.), the outputs of the \noverall project will be as described in paras. 13\u201314.28  \n \n13.  Output  1:  Municipal  infrastructure  improved  and  made  gender  and  climate \nresponsive. The overall project will provide the following: (i) 600 kilometers (km) of roads \nimproved or rehabilitated; (ii) 300 km of drains built or improved; (iii) 180 km of pipes installed or \nupgraded for water supply with 60,000 individual meters; (iv) slum improvement subprojects \ncompleted in all project towns with slums; (v) sludge management facilities built in 14 project \ntowns; (vi) solid waste disposal sites built or improved in 20 project towns (total capacity 200 tons \nper day); (vii) climate issues considered in designing 80% of subprojects and incorporated, if \nnecessary; and (viii) about 15,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide emissions reduced.29 \n \n14.  Output 2: Capacity of pourashavas in urban service delivery, planning, and financial \nmanagement improved. The overall project will provide the following: (i) town coordination and \nward committees formed in 35 project towns; (ii) urban master plans developed through gender-\ninclusive processes gazetted in 35 project towns; (iii) standing committees on woman and children \naffairs, poverty reduction, and slum improvement (with 40% women participation) operationalized \nin 35 project towns; (iv) pourashava development plans, GAPs, and poverty reduction action plans \n(PRAPs) approved in 35 project towns; (v) annual O&M plans approved and budget allocated for \nimplementation in 35 project towns; (vi) computerized tax records and billing systems made \nfunctional in 35 project towns; and (vii) top-performing pourashavas under window B awarded \nsubproject funding. \n \n15.  Subproject selection criteria. Although selection of subprojects will generally follow the \npriorities set by each pourashava, the overall project will focus on key infrastructure such as roads, \ndrainage, water supply, and sanitation, including septic tank sludge management, solid waste and \nfecal sludge management, and slum improvements. Other municipal facilities such as markets \nand bus terminals will be supported if sustainable O&M arrangements are clearly established. \nSubprojects in each phase will be stand-alone to avoid the risk of pourashavas not proceeding to \nthe next phase because of poor governance. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n16.  The overall project is estimated to cost $504.1 million, including additional financing of \n$200.0 million from ADB (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by expenditure categories and detailed \ncost estimates by financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).30 \n \n                                                \n27 \u2018Project towns\u2019 refer to preselected pourashavas under window A. \n28 In accordance with ADB\u2019s Updated Design and Monitoring Framework Guidelines (2015), output 3 in the design and \nmonitoring framework for current project will be removed and included under key activities with milestones. \n29 Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The \npourashavas will be the implementing agencies, supported by consultants for (i) management, \ndesign,  and  supervision;  and  (ii)  governance  improvement  and  capacity  development. \nImplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM \n(footnote 30). Goods and civil works procured using national competitive bidding will follow the \nnational procedures being used in the current project, which are acceptable to ADB. ADB and the \ngovernment have reviewed these to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time).32 Consultants will be engaged using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  August 2017\u2013June 2021 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2021 (loan closing date: 31 December 2021) \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body  Inter-ministerial project steering committee, chaired by secretary, LGD: LGED; \nDPHE; Department of Environment; Economic Relations Division; Finance Division; \nImplementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division; LGD; Ministry of Housing and \nPublic Works (Urban Development Directorate); Ministry of Women and Children \nAffairs; Municipal Association of Bangladesh; Planning Commission (Physical \nInfrastructure Division); National Institute of Local Government. \n(ii) Executing agencies  LGED and DPHE \n(iii) Implementing agencies  Pourashavas  \n(iv) Implementation unit  Pourashavas (total 35), 11 staff each  \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  About 5 contracts  $4.83 million \nNational competitive bidding  About 230 contracts  $174.56 million \nShopping  About 2 contracts  $0.07 million \n  Community participation in  About 170 contracts  $11.80 million \nprocurementa \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection   3,976 person-months (5  $7.90 million \npackages) \n                                                \n32 Universal procurement will continue to apply to the additional financing.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  Sample  subprojects  appraised  during  the  current  project  and  developed  during \npreparation of the additional financing confirmed the technical viability and compatibility with local \nimplementation and O&M capacity. The same approach will be followed for future subproject \ndesign in accordance with subproject selection and design criteria, considering climate change, \nextreme  weather,  and  natural  hazards  (footnote  30).  Subprojects  will  be  technically  and \noperationally most appropriate, sustainable and least-cost, and designed based on whole-of-life \nanalysis.33 Engineering designs will take into consideration the impact of climate change (flooding \nand waterlogging and, where relevant, increased salinity and wind loads) on vulnerable people \nand infrastructure systems and services.34 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic analysis. The expected economic benefits are mainly (i) reduced vehicle \noperating costs and travel time savings; (ii) reduced property damage and loss of income from \nflooding; and (iii) improved health and resource savings with getting water from piped supply. \nResults  of  economic  and  sensitivity  analyses  confirm  that  two  sample  subprojects  are \neconomically viable, as base economic internal rates of return are 18.2% and 19.5%, respectively, \nwhich are above the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%. Sensitivity analysis results are \nsatisfactory  unless  all  downside  risks  are  combined.35 Subprojects  to  be  prepared  during \nimplementation will need to meet the economic and financial criteria in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \n22.  Financial analysis. A financial analysis was conducted for two sample subprojects with \na cost recovery objective by estimating the incremental costs and revenues over the project life.36 \nThe financial internal rates of return were estimated at 4.2% for the water supply subproject and \n4.4% for the market development subproject, higher than the weighted average cost of capital of \n1.9%, indicating sufficient financial returns. For subprojects that will not generate revenue, the \nanalysis  focused  on  the  pourashava\u2019s  financial  capacity  to  meet  incremental  costs  of  the \nsubprojects.  The  overall  municipal  financial  position  was  projected,  reflecting  incremental \nrevenues and expenditures and debt service. The projection confirmed that the sample subproject \n                                                \n33 Refers to the total cost of ownership over the life of an asset. \n34 Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management Reporting (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n35 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \npourashavas would have adequate financial capacity to meet incremental O&M costs and other \nrequirements to sustain infrastructure and service delivery for the subprojects. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  The executing and implementing agencies were assessed on ADB\u2019s procurement and \nfinancial management requirements.37 Procurement contracts financed by ADB are subject to \nADB\u2019s review and include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine records \nand  accounts  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the additional financing. \n \n24.  The financial management risk rating is moderate. An assessment of LGED, DPHE, and \nthe pourashavas indicated that, with support of a dedicated financial management consultant in \nthe project management unit (PMU) and a dedicated accountant in each project implementation \nunit (PIU), financial management capabilities and implementation support will be adequately \nstrengthened.38 The procurement risk assessment rating is low.39 The LGED has experience in \nprocuring  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  in  accordance  with  ADB  procedures  and \nrequirements. The PMU and loan-funded specialists will support the PIUs in preparing and \nevaluating bid documents. This will be supplemented by regular training on procurement and \naccounting for the PIUs and other staff. Other measures to ensure transparency include the \npresentation of procurement information at public meetings to supplement online disclosure. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  Men and women, including the poor living in the pourashavas, will benefit from the overall \nproject,  which  is  classified  as  having  a  gender  equity  theme.40 The  project  will  enhance \ninclusiveness of poor and marginalized groups in municipal decision making by (i) ensuring their \nsufficient representation on town coordination and ward committees; (ii) having each pourashava \nprepare a PRAP and GAP;41 (iii) forming poverty-reduction and slum-improvement committees; \n(iv) improving infrastructure and basic services in slums; and (v) upgrading health, hygiene, and \nthe  environment  through  a  targeted  project  awareness-raising  program.  The  design  of \ninfrastructure improvements will consider women\u2019s needs. Women\u2019s decision-making capacity \nand the focus of services and infrastructure on women will be enhanced. Implementation of \nPRAPs and GAPs, including the pourashavas\u2019 budget allocation, will be monitored. With the \nadditional financing, the GAP activities in pourashavas that are included under the current project \nwill be continued, and the five new pourashavas will follow the same gender design as under the \ncurrent project. Adequate resources are allocated for implementation and monitoring. \n                                                \n37 ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly, or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \ncoercive practices relating to the project. \n38 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 Procurement Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible form the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  Safeguards  compliance.  The  current  project\u2019s  compliance  with  the  safeguard \nrequirements has been satisfactory and risks have been well-managed.42 A project-specific \ngrievance redress mechanism has been established and is functional. A corrective action plan \nwas prepared and is being implemented for one reported complaint. \n \n28.  Environmental  and  social  safeguards.  The  project  remains  category  B  for  the \nenvironment and involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. The additional \nfinancing  will  have  no  significant  impacts  on  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples, as subprojects with significant impacts will be excluded in accordance with \nsubproject  selection  criteria. 43  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework, \nresettlement framework, and indigenous peoples planning framework of the current project were \nupdated.44 Five draft initial environmental examinations, prepared for representative sample \nsubprojects, confirmed no significant environmental impacts.45 Subprojects are generally small, \nsites are outside sensitive areas, and any impact during construction and operation can be \navoided or mitigated through proper design, high-quality construction, and O&M practices. Initial \nenvironmental examinations will be part of the bidding and contract documents. No permanent \ninvoluntary land acquisition or physical displacement is identified for sample subprojects in two \npourashavas. 46 Four acres of land from five landowners will be obtained through negotiated \nsettlement.47 For the sample road and drainage subprojects, 53 shop owners and/or households \nare expected to temporarily lose access to government lands for economic activities or residence. \nNo impacts on indigenous people\u2019s communities were  identified in the sample towns, and \nbeneficiaries\u2019 population is completely urban. Due diligence report for a sample solid waste \nsubproject confirmed the absence of involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples impacts. 48 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  The  overall  risk  assessment  is  moderate.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.49 Intended benefits are expected to outweigh costs. \n \n                                                \n42 The current project\u2019s PMU and PIUs have developed institutional capacity to implement and monitor safeguards; \nPMU safeguard managers are in place and supported by loan-funded specialists. \n43 Potential safeguard category A subprojects with significant safeguard impacts will be excluded. \n44 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework, Resettlement Framework, and Indigenous Peoples Planning \nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n45 Initial Environmental Examination (IEE): Faridpur Water Supply; IEE: Mymensingh Solid Waste Management; IEE: \nGopalganj Roads; IEE: Cox\u2019s Bazar Drainage; and IEE: Kushtia Sanitation (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n46 Resettlement Plan: Mymensingh Roads and Drains and Resettlement Plan: Cox\u2019s Bazar Roads and Drains \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2), prepared in consultation with affected people, are \nappropriate to the identified potential impacts.
