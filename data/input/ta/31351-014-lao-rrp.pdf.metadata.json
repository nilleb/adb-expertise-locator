I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  additional  financing  of  the \nSmallholder Development Project (overall project).1 \n2.  The agriculture and forestry sectors remain Lao PDR\u2019s primary source of livelihood and \nplay a key role in reducing national poverty. The Smallholder Development Project (current \nproject)  has  therefore  been  promoting  sustainable  commercial  smallholder  agriculture  and \nassociated  agribusiness  through  strengthening  extension  services,  enhancing  access  to \ninformation and markets, capacity building, and increasing investments in agribusiness. The \nproposed additional financing, which will consolidate and expand well-performing investments \ninitiated under the current project, covers eight new districts in the existing four provinces. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Agriculture is the dominant sector in Lao PDR, accounting for about 40% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and more than 70% of employment. More than 85% of the population \nlives in rural areas, making a living largely by subsistence cultivation of rice. At the end of 2010, \nmore than 30% of the rural population was living in poverty. The incidence of poverty, which is \nclosely  linked  to  agricultural  performance,  can  be  reduced  by  moving  farmers  beyond \nsubsistence farming to more diversified and commercial agricultural production of cash crops \nwith  ready  markets  in  neighboring  countries.  The  irrigated  floodplain  of  the  Mekong  River \nproduces most of the country\u2019s marketable surplus of rice and other crops, and offers the \nstrongest potential for commercialization of agriculture. However, even in these areas, rice \nproductivity is below that of its neighbors. The productivity and quality of crops other than rice \nalso remain low because of limited information on markets, poor technical expertise, restricted \naccess to markets for inputs and products, lack of credit, low domestic demand, and a dearth of \nvalue-adding enterprises. The extension system has been largely dysfunctional because of \nsevere  budget  constraints,  poor  organization  and  staffing,  and  a  policy  environment  not \nconducive to the efficient functioning of input and product markets. By providing simple inputs, a \nlarge impact can be achieved, mainly through training, awareness raising, and application of \nappropriate policies.   \n4.  Against this backdrop, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Smallholder \nDevelopment Project for $12 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources in November \n2002.2 The completion date was 30 June 2011 and the closing date 31 December 2011.3 The \npurpose  of  the  current  project  was  to  establish  sustainable  smallholder  agribusiness.  The \ncurrent  project  focused  on  (i) effective  agricultural  extension  and  training  mechanisms,  (ii) \nimproved physical infrastructure and marketing of agricultural goods, and (iii) effective primary \nmarket networks. The current project has (i) established 162 farmer production and marketing \ngroups (FPMGs) and organized training on agricultural production techniques and post-harvest \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Smallholder Development Project. Manila (Loan \n1949-LAO and TA 4005-LAO). \n3  The original loan closing date of 31 October 2009 was extended to 31 December 2011 due to (i) startup delays in \nearlier years of implementation, and (ii) severe floods in July and August 2011 hindering the delivery of procured \npost harvest equipment and rice seeds to the project beneficiaries. \n ", "2 \npractices; (ii) developed agricultural extension services to assist farmers\u2019 groups, processors, \nand traders with the establishment of contract farming; (iii) upgraded 89.5 kilometers of access \nroads and built 70.8 kilometers of new feeder roads; (iv) delivered an agriculture and marketing \ninformation system; (v) constructed six markets; and (vi) provided post-harvest technology and \nassociated equipment. These investments created a favorable environment for the development \nof commercial agribusiness and contributed to the improvement of farmers\u2019 incomes. As a \nresult,  the  outcomes  of  the  Project  have  largely  been  achieved.  An  average  beneficiary \nsmallholder household income in Khammouan province, poorest among the project provinces, \nincreased to $675 in 2010 from $280 in 2002.4 The same trend has been observed in the other \nproject provinces.5 \n5.  As of 30 June 2011, overall physical progress was estimated at 99% against an elapsed \nloan  period  of  98%.  Total  cumulative  contract  awards  were  $12.8  million  (92%)  and \ndisbursements  were  $13.1  million  (94%).  The  rate  of  disbursements  and  contract  awards \nimproved significantly after the midterm review. No major issues were identified and applicable \nsafeguard policies have been observed. Since the midterm review, the Project has been rated \n\u2018satisfactory\u2019 in the project performance rating. Therefore, the current project is considered to be \nperforming well as stipulated in the Operations Manual Section H5/OP.6 \n6.  The current project has been successful in achieving the overall development objectives \nand demonstrated that (i) capacity building of farmers\u2019 groups is vital to produce surplus for \nagricultural commercialization; (ii) knowledge transfer and exchange visits stimulate new ideas \namong FPMGs and encourages adoption of new agricultural techniques, and (iii) strengthening \nlinkages amongst all members along the marketing chain promotes greater appreciation of their \nrespective issues. Further, a number of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) were initiated. These \ninclude (i) collaboration between rice miller groups in the rice value chain and FPMGs, (ii) the \ninvolvement of trading groups in contract farming arrangements and in providing extension \nservices and agriculture inputs to FPMGs, and (iii) cooperation with the Lao PDR\u2013India training \ncenter to train farmer groups and officials on entrepreneurship and marketing. \n7.  During  the  loan  review  mission  conducted  by  ADB  Lao  PDR  Resident  Mission  in \nFebruary  2011,  the  government  requested  ADB  for  additional  financing  to  strengthen \nsustainable smallholder commercial agriculture by consolidating and expanding the activities \nunder  the  current  project. 7  Building  on  the  established  capacity  and  implementation \narrangements,  the  additional  financing  will  replicate  well-performing  activities,  improve  the \nsustainability of existing interventions, and add eight new districts8 while rationalizing activities \nundertaken in the existing 16 districts of the current project. \n8.  The Project meets the four eligibility criteria for additional financing as stipulated in the \nOperations  Manual  H5/BP9 -  (i)  the  overall  performance  of  the  current  project  is  rated \nsatisfactory and no significant changes in approaches and methodologies are envisioned. This \n                                                 \n4  Government of the Lao PDR. 2011. Project Monitoring and Evaluation Survey, 2011.

Additional Financing. Operations Manual. H5/OP. Manila (para. 3). \n7  The new districts have been selected based on the following criteria: (i) demonstrated farmer initiatives in farmer \norganizations  or  farmer  groups,  (ii)  sense  of  ownership  and  participation  shown,  (iii)  existence  of  basic \ninfrastructure such as access roads, and (iv) potential for the selected crops and rice. \n8  New  districts  include  Khong  and  Sanasomboun  in  Champassak,  Mahaxai  and  Xebanfai  in  Khammouan, \nAtsaphangthong and Phalanxay in Savannakhet and Kasi and Xanakham in Vientiane provinces. \n9  ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. H5/BP. Manila (para. 4). \n ", "3 \nwill ensure that the Project will be technically feasible, economically viable, and financially \nsound; (ii) the government accords the Project high priority through its request for additional \nfinancing; (iii) while project outputs will be expanded to reach more beneficiaries, the Project will \nretain the same overall objectives; and (iv) the outcome is consistent with the current  country \npartnership strategy (CPS)10 which promotes agriculture and rural development in the context of \nsustainable economic growth and improved livelihoods of vulnerable groups. \n9.  The Project has a substantial degree of readiness. The capacity of the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Forestry (MAF) (the Executing Agency) and the National Agriculture Forestry \nExtension Service (NAFES) (the Implementing Agency) has improved over the course of the \ncurrent project implementation. Additional financing is considered to be a suitable instrument to \npromptly respond to the government\u2019s needs and sustain the development momentum of the \ncurrent project. Therefore, the overall project will enhance the positive impacts of sustainable \nsmallholder commercial agriculture and improve livelihoods through PPPs for agribusiness. The \nestablishment  of  PPPs  will  enhance  and  sustain  agriculture  production  techniques  and \nmarketing in the project areas. \n10.  Sustainable agricultural practices promoted by the Project will generate climate change \nbenefits by building more climate resilient agrisystems and reducing agricultural greenhouse \ngas emissions. Management practices and approaches to organic farming will optimize use of \n(i) bio-pesticides and minimum tillage systems; (ii) natural, locally available nutrients, mostly \nfrom manure, crop residues, and weed biomass; and (iii) nitrogen-fixing legumes grown in \nrotation.  The  interventions  will  promote  carbon  sequestration  and  soil  stabilization  through \nincreased storage of carbon in soil and plant biomass. \n11.  While the current project was classified in the some gender benefit category, the active \nparticipation of women was evident during its implementation. It involved women in various \ncapacity  development  activities  such  as  entrepreneurial  and  group  management  training, \nagribusiness workshops, and strategic community dialogue. Women took the lead in organic \nvegetable farming, corn production, food processing, and rice miller groups. The participation of \nwomen in study tours and farmer exchanges has demonstrated that entrepreneurship and \nmarketing skills of women have improved. Women took the initiative in preparing strategic \nproduction and marketing plans in farmer groups. This momentum needs to be continued and \nstrengthened. The overall project will give priority to women beneficiaries in implementing the \nplanned activities, and encourage more women to participate in project implementation, benefit \nmonitoring, dissemination of project achievements, and evaluation of project performance. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  expected  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  agricultural  productivity.  The \noutcome  will  be  the  improved  sustainability  of  smallholder  commercial  agriculture  in \nChampassak, Khammouan, Savannakhet, and Vientiane provinces. The outcome and impact \nstatements  of  the  Project  have  been  updated  to  better  reflect  the  focus  on  smallholder \nagriculture productivity and sustainability. \n                                                 \n10 The CPS focuses on five core areas: (i) education; (ii) agriculture, natural resources management, environment, \nand climate change; (iii) urban development including water supply and sanitation; (iv) public sector management; \nand (v) energy.  \n ", "4 \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The project design considered lessons learned from the current project, particularly with \nregard to the replication of integrated agribusiness models, expansion of organic farming and \npost-harvesting practices, and strengthening of the capacity of farmer groups in production \ntechniques. The Project will have five outputs. \n14.  Output 1: Strengthened farmer production and marketing groups.

The capacity development plan is included in the \nproject administration manual.12 \n19.  Value addition will be generated by (i) the application of integrated extension services, \n(ii) building the capacity of staff at the new district project management offices and of the project \nbeneficiaries, and (iii) engaging more women in undertaking activities in the overall project. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $5.50 million (Table 1). As of July 2011, the cost of the \ncurrent  project  was  $15.23  million  equivalent,  financed  by  an  ADF  loan  of  $12.00  million \nequivalent (denominated in SDR). The overall project is estimated to cost $20.73 million. \n21.  The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR3,155,000 \n($5.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan will be used for civil works, vehicles \nand  equipment,  training  and  workshops,  consulting  services,  incremental  operating  costs, \ninterest  during  implementation,  contingencies,  and  taxes  and  duties.  The  government  has \nrequested ADB to (i) consider approval of advance contracting for civil works13 and goods; and \n(ii)  retroactive  financing  of  about  $500,000  for  consulting  services,  civil  works,  and  goods \ncontract packages. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nOriginal  Amount Additional \nTotal \nItem  Project  Financinga \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The implementation arrangements are described in detail in the project administration \nmanual (footnote 12). The existing implementation arrangements for the current project will be \nretained  with  minor  changes  to  reduce  implementation  costs  and  improve  implementation \nefficiency. The Office of the National Project Director (ONPD) will continue to provide overall \ncoordination. Additional staff will be recruited for eight district coordination offices. The ongoing \nnational project steering committee chaired by MAF will provide overall guidance on project \nimplementation. Other existing organizations will be retained and include staff of NAFES, the \nprovincial agriculture and forestry offices, ATEC, and the district agriculture and forestry offices. \nThe project implementation period will be from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n24.  Project impact can be expected to be similar to that of the current project. Selection of \nthe targeted villages was carried out through various consultation meetings and government \nprocedures in the field and follows provincial and district development strategies. Economic \nbenefits, financial viability, and project sustainability were analyzed based on the demonstrated \nperformance of the current project. \nA.  Technical \n25.  A  national  project  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  vice  minister  of  MAF,  has \nfunctioned well to provide oversight on implementation and coordination. ONPD has effectively \ncoordinated with relevant agencies involved in the project implementation. The implementation \narrangements at central, provincial, and district levels, established under the current project, \nhave proved to be effective. These existing structures will provide a platform for the smooth \nimplementation of the Project and provide the opportunity for active participation by farmers. \nPost-harvest techniques, extension services, and new agricultural initiatives of organic farming \nprovided by the current project have demonstrated their relevance with farmers benefiting from \nhigher  incomes  and  improved  livelihoods.  The  agribusiness  models  established  under  the \ncurrent project have been effective and were important in supporting commercialization of \nagriculture under the framework of the Lao PDR agriculture sector strategy and master plan. \n                                                 \n14 ADB  and  the  government  agreed  on  counterpart  funding  in-kind  during  the  CPS  consultations  since  the \ngovernment faces challenges in providing cash contributions. \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  The economic benefits of the Project will include (i) improved agricultural productivity \namongst direct farmer group beneficiaries and those who can benefit indirectly from project \nactivities, (ii) improved household incomes amongst participating farmers, (iii) an expanded area \nof influence for project interventions, (vi) more diversified farming household income sources \nthrough the introduction of higher valued commodities, (v) improved input supply mechanisms \nthrough group initiatives for credit, equipment, animal health products, fertilizer, and agricultural \nmachinery,  (vi)  enhanced  technical  and  communication  capacities  amongst  extension  staff \nwithin  MAF,  (vii)  strengthened  PPPs  for  agribusiness,  and  (viii)  improved  technical  and \nmanagement  capacities  amongst  target  rural  communities.  The  economic  analysis  of  the \nadditional financing indicates an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 22.4% based on \nquantified incremental benefits from increased productivity in wet and dry season rice, maize, \nvegetables and from livestock production. While the reassessment of the current project shows \nan EIRR of 16.3%,15 the combined impact is to elevate the EIRR to an estimated 16.9%. The \ninvestment  is  sensitive  to  price  decreases  in  rice  but  this  risk  is  considered  minimal  as \nconservative estimates were used in the analysis. Overall the Project is considered a sound \ninvestment contributing to economic growth of the area, to farmer household incomes that will \nfurther reduce poverty as benefits are broadly distributed.16 \nC.  Governance \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  in  relation  to  project  activities.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 12). The \nProject will assist provincial and district administrations in addressing governance issues. The \ninvolvement of communities and extension workers in project implementation is expected to \nincrease the transparency of project-related decision-making and accountability. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The Project is located in provinces and districts primarily contiguous to the Mekong \nRiver. Thus, most of these districts are not among the poorest in the Lao PDR. However, of the \n16 districts where the project has been implemented since 2002, two in Champassak are rated \namong the 45 poorest districts nationally. Of the eight new districts, Phalanxay in Savannakhet \nis rated as among the poorest with over 11% poor households. Of the 64,400 households in \nnew districts, 1,830 are considered poor. Of the total, 3,930 households belong to various ethnic \ngroups, and 270 are households headed by women. The overall project will enable households \nto benefit from increased trade and economic growth through effective agricultural extension \nand marketing efforts. The eight new districts have villages with the same ethnic heterogeneity \nas in the current project. Villages are not remote and have a long history of cross-cultural and \neconomic  interaction with  other groups.  They  are  all  involved,  at  different levels,  in  some \ncommercial activities. The Project has been screened in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). As project processes are highly participatory, involvement in activities \nis based on the household\u2019s willingness to participate. \n29.  The main gender issues in smallholder development are low productivity among women \nproducers; limited knowledge, credit, and skills to engage in alternative income-generating \n                                                 \n15 At appraisal, the EIRR estimate was 19.9%. Due to startup delays, benefit streams were slow to materialize and \nthe reassessed EIRR at project completion was 16.3%. \n16 Details are in the economic analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nactivities such as agribusinesses, resulting in risk adverse attitudes; limited access to extension \nservices; limited knowledge of marketing; and limited participation in FPMGs. An important \nlesson learned from the current project is the need for explicit attention to gender equality such \nas  setting  targets  for women\u2019s  participation.  The  overall  project  will  address  this  issue  by \nintroducing gender-inclusive design features and targets, which are reflected in the gender \naction  plan.17 The  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  will  be  monitored  by  ONPD, \nassisted by a national gender and development specialist. \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Environmental  safeguards  (category  B).  None  of  the  proposed  activities  directly \nimpinges upon the environment. The Project will have limited environmental impact and, in all \nsuch cases, effective mitigation measures can be designed. Promotion of sustainable farming \nand associated marketing activities will have beneficial environmental impacts. Village post-\nharvest operations are small-scale and will therefore have no negative environmental impact. \nAwareness-raising  activities  will  increase  community  consciousness  of  the  need  to  follow \nsustainable  practices.  In  addition,  no  new  construction  of  major  facilities  or  physical \ninfrastructure is planned. Following the procedures set forth in the environmental assessment \nand  review  framework,  a  screening  process  will  be  established  to  categorize  subproject \nactivities  according  to  their  environmental  sensitivity.  Where  needed,  existing  initial \nenvironmental examinations and environmental management plans will be updated to address \nsite-specific  issues  consistent  with  government  requirements  and  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). An environmental safeguard specialist will assist project staff in complying \nwith the requirements and monitor these procedures. \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The Project has been screened for involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples safeguards against ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). Project activities will not involve any involuntary acquisition of land or assets, and no \ncompensation will be required. None of the project components, activities, or community works \n(e.g.,  construction  of  community  rice  drying  facilities,  training  rooms,  and  rice  storage)  is \nexpected to entail any land acquisition, conversion, donation, or restrictions of access that will \ntrigger ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The purpose of the Project remains the promotion of \ncommercial  smallholder  agriculture  and  associated  agribusiness  in  the  Lao  PDR,  with  the \noverall objectives of achieving sustained increases in rural incomes and long-term reductions in \nrural poverty through growth of the commercial agriculture sector. Guiding principles of village \nselection  to  achieve  this  aim  remain  the  same,  namely  in  areas  with  high  potential  for \nagribusiness and where farmers are already linked to external markets. The Project is not being \ncarried out in remote upland areas characterized by higher numbers of poorer ethnic groups. \nHouseholds from different ethnic groups in the overall project area have largely assimilated into \na settled agricultural production economy, and there continues to be no significant difference \nbetween ethnic groups, their needs, demands, social functioning, and development objectives. \nHousehold participation in the Project is based on individual willingness or interest determined \nthrough a community consultation process. Safeguards screening against ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  indicates  that  no  adverse  effects  on  different  ethnic  groups  are \nanticipated  and  no  commercial  development  of  cultural  or  natural  resources  is  involved. \n                                                 \n17 The Project is categorized as \u201cEffective Gender Mainstreaming\u201d. The Gender Action Plan is accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2. \n ", "9 \nOpportunities  under  the  overall  project  for  developing  commercial  agriculture  are  directed \ntowards households from all different ethnic groups that seek to take advantage of smallholder \nengagement in commercial agricultural production. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  The overall project is categorized as \u201clow risk\u201d as (i) the loan amount is $5 million; \n(ii) post-harvest technologies have been tested and proven to be technically viable; (iii) MAF \nand NAFES have gained the necessary experience and skills to implement the overall project; \nand (iv) the safeguard categorization is other than A. A risk assessment and risk management \nplan was prepared.18 Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan. \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measure \nLimited capacity of new district staff  The Project will build the capacity of the staff \nthrough training in project administration, finance, \nand procurement. \nLimited coordination among key stakeholders  The Project will address this through consultation \ninvolved in agribusiness  meetings and training of local officials, and facilitate \npolicy dialogue between officials and agribusiness \ngroups.\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n34.  The  government  has  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  overall  project  shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan agreement. \n35.
