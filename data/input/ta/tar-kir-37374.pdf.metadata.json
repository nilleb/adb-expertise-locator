Advisory technical assistance (TA) for supporting land use management on Kiritimati \n(Christmas)  Island  was  included  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  2003  nonlending \nprogram for Kiribati after the country consultation mission in May 2003 and the Government \nconfirmed its request to include the TA grant from ADB.1 The TA will promote the development \nof the island as a new growth center in the eastern part of the country. A Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited Kiritimati Island during 13-19 October and Tarawa during 26-29 October 2003 and held \nconsultations with Government officials, the private sector, and an assistance agency (Australian \nAgency for International Development [AusAID]). The Mission reached an understanding with the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, and the implementation arrangements of the TA.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Republic of Kiribati consists of three groups of islands: the Gilbert Islands, the \nPhoenix Group Islands, and the Line Islands. There are 33 islands with a total land area of 810 \nsquare kilometers (km2) within an exclusive economic zone of 3.5 million km2. Land on the \nGilbert Islands is generally customary land, whereas lands on the Phoenix Group and on the \nLine Islands, where people only recently settled, are state land.2 The northern Line Islands that \ninclude Kiritimati (Christmas), Teraina (Washington), and Tabuaeran (Fanning), which were sold \nto private owners in the colonial period, were purchased back by the Government in 1983. \nKiritimati (475 km2) was virtually uninhabited until the mid-1950s, but had a population of 5,500 \nin 2002.  \n \n3.   Four  acts  and  ordinances  govern  land  management  in  Kiribati.3  Two  of  the \nacts/ordinances  are  specifically  relevant  to  Kiritimati  Island.  The  Land  Planning  Ordinance \naddresses land use plans and development control for state lands. It regulates the issuance of \npermits to develop or redevelop state land for residential and business purposes; however, the \nGovernment specifies that only development for business is allowed for Kiritimati Island. The \nState  Land  Act  2001  focuses  on  contract  ownership  for  family  residential  development.  It \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  resettlement  program  from  densely  populated  Tarawa  to  outer \nislands.4 Thus, the Land Planning Ordinance and State Land Act complement each other: the \nLand Planning Ordinance emphasizes business development leases, whereas the State Land \nAct focuses on residential uses.  \n \n4.  To improve land management including the land registration system in Kiribati, ADB \nprovided  TA  to  enhance  the  Government\u2019s  information  capacity  in  urban  planning, \nenvironmental conservation, natural resource management, and infrastructure planning and \ndesign for Tarawa.5 The TA was closed in May 1999, after successfully providing the Land \n                                                 \n1 Memorandum of Understanding of the 2003 Country Consultation Mission signed by the Asian Development Bank       \nand the Government of Kiribati on 29 May 2003. The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet   \nedition) on 3 July 2003. \n2  Customary  lands  are  lands  traditionally  and  communally  own  by  communities  and  are  inherited  through     \ngenerations. State lands are lands under government control. \n3  The Land Planning Ordinance (CAP. 48, 1977), Native Lands Ordinance (CAP. 61, 1977), State Pre-Emptive Right \nof Purchase Act 2001 (Act to Afford Kiribati a Pre-Emptive Right to Purchase Certain Land for Land Planning \nPurposes), and State Land Act 2001 (Act to Establish A Land Tenure and Administration System for State-Owned \nLands on Islands in the Republic of Kiribati Where Development and Settlement to Be Encouraged). \n4  A resettlement program was carried out to resettle people from Tarawa to Teraina and Tabuaeran during 1988\u2013\n1992, but was suspended considering the carrying capacity of the islands. Kiritimati Island is now considered for \naccommodating people resettled from Tarawa. \n5  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to Kiribati for Aerial Photography and Mapping of Tarawa. Manila. ", "2 \nManagement Division in Tarawa with a computer-generated cadastral base for an effective land \nregistration system.  \n \n5.  To address emerging land issues on the Line and Phoenix Islands, the Government \nestablished the Land Management Division, Kiritimati (LMDK) in 2001 under the (now) Ministry \nof Environment, Lands, and Agricultural Development (MELAD). The Government commitment \nto  establish  LMDK  was  included  in  the  National  Development  Strategy  2000\u20132003.  The \nmandate of LMDK includes (i) providing a land planning framework for managing both private \nand  government  land;  (ii)  providing  an  efficient  land  information  system;  (iii)  undertaking \ncadastral survey, identifying boundaries, and producing maps and plans; (iv) taking a lead role \nin  management  and  planning  of  the  Line  and  Phoenix  (LINNIX)  group  islands;  and  (v) \nadministering and enforcing legislation relating to lands and land use planning. LMDK functions \nas  technical  secretary  of  the  Kiritimati  Local  Land  Planning  Board  (KLLPB).  KLLPB  is  an \ninteragency body chaired by the permanent secretary of LINNIX.6 Its major tasks are to (i) \nprepare detailed land use plans, and consider lease applications for land development and \nredevelopment within designated areas; (ii) maintain an applications register and a permission \ngranted  register;  (iii) impose  any  planning, building,  and  lease  conditions  that  it considers \nnecessary (development control); and (iv) prepare regulations prescribing the design, structure, \nand materials in constructing buildings within the designated area.  \n \n6.   In 2001, AusAID provided technical assistance for strengthening the newly formed \nLMDK.7 This assistance has been completed and provided moderate ability in LMDK to use a \ngeographic information system (GIS), mapping system, and a computerized land information \nsystem, including an inventory of commercial leases and freehold land sales on Kiritimati, \nTeraina, and Tabuaeran islands (called the Line and Phoenix Land Information System or \nLAPLIS). LAPLIS and the GIS provide a number of outputs, including a general land use plan \n(GLUP), draft detailed land use plans (DLUPs) for priority areas, location and details of lease \napplications, purchase of freehold land, and rental payments. The two systems are not yet \nintegrated  and  unfortunately  still  run  separately.  Furthermore,  sustainable  functioning  of \nequipment, repairs, and maintenance have proved to be key difficulties because technical \nsupport is not available on the island. A simple failure of the ethernet hub switch has resulted in \nthe breakdown of the network system that significantly affected the functioning of LAPLIS. Staff \nare now reverting to recording lease applications on a much simpler spreadsheet (about 20 \napplications for 2003 have not been included in LAPLIS).  \n \n7.  Land  is  made  available  through  development/redevelopment  leases  or  freehold \nownership.8 The procedure for obtaining a land lease permit requires submission of a lease \napplication and business plan to KLLPB which evaluates the application during its irregular \nboard meeting and decides whether to approve or reject the proposal. Successful application \nwill be further processed for endorsement by the Minister of MELAD (which process will also \n                                                 \n6  KLLPB  members  include  the  Land  Management  Division  (MELAD),  Agricultural  Division  (MELAD),  Wildlife \nConservation Unit (MELAD), Environment Division (MELAD), Commerce Division (Ministry of Commerce, Industry \n& Cooperative), Civil Engineering (LINNIX), Development Planning (LINNIX), Baneawa Women's Organization, and \nthe Land Planning Officer as KLLPB\u2019s Secretary. \n7 The technical assistance (A$1.2 million [equivalent to $600,000]), implemented from June 2001 to November 2002) \ncovered the following components: establishing office management and planning capabilities facilitating better \ncoordination  between  key  players  establishing  mapping  and  land  registration  system  promoting  community \nawareness responding to and resolving pressing land planning needs and facilitating effective project management \nprocesses. \n8  The size of land for development lease is normally 0.25 acre on Kiritimati Island, but can be larger. The lease rates \nregardless of location are as follows: commercial lease, A$1,129.50 per acre; residential lease, A$874.50 per acre; \nand land purchase price for freehold land, A$1,000 per 0.5 acre.  ", "    3 \ninclude  endorsement  by  the  Cabinet).  No  strict  time  limits  are  presently  followed  for  the \nprocessing and the time could stretch up to more than 2 years. The identified lot is leased for 25 \nyears, renewable for a further lease for one term only for a period no longer than 25 years, after \nwhich the land and unmovable structures will be returned to the Government (a practice that \ncan  discourage  long-term  investments).  From  October  1995  to  December  2002,  over  395 \nbusiness applications were submitted to KLLPB. Of that number, 77 applications were rejected, \nand those that were approved were forwarded to the Ministry. Until early 2003 only 115 had \nbeen endorsed by the Cabinet, and 203 applications were deferred.9 Among the reasons given \nfor rejection is the large number of business ventures proposed without a defined market, or \nmany similar business proposals. There are also cases where people had applied for a land \nlease for business, but built a house instead and lived there without engaging in any business. \n(Government entities and the churches can apply for residential leases with the same lease \nterms.) Thus, KLLPB has resolved not to consider any further lease applications until the \nCabinet has decided on the outstanding applications. To minimize inappropriate land uses, the \nCabinet recently approved the GLUP for Kiritimati Island. \n \n8.  There  is  a  relatively  large  amount  of  outstanding  rent  from  commercial  as  well  as \nresidential leases. According to LAPLIS, from October 1995 to December 2002, 106 recorded \nleases on Kiritimati Island with a total lease area of 96.5 acres (or 38.6 hectares) had a total \ncumulative  rent  of  A$325,049  (equivalent  to  $234,360),  of  which  the  overdue  rental  is \nA$223,516 (equivalent to $161,155) (69%). To date, the Ministry of LINNIX has neither enforced \nsanctions for noncompliance with the business lease requirements nor collected outstanding \nrent, although it routinely inspects the properties and reports on progress. Aside from those \nissues, several others also need attention, e.g.: (i) the GLUP inadequately covers the potentials \nof the island; (ii) there is no land valuation system and so land leases are uniform in all parts of \nthe island (it may lead to overcrowding in particular areas with better infrastructure facilities); (iii) \nbecause  LAPLIS  and  the  GIS  systems  still  run  separately,  implementation  of  the  land \nmanagement system is not optimal; (iv) there is no hardware and software maintenance; and (v) \nclear criteria and procedures for land allocation and leases need to be shed.  \n \n9.  As land is a basic requirement for residential and business development, improving the \nland management system should receive appropriate attention so that land for legitimate uses \ncan be more efficiently and effectively mobilized. The TA will help achieve the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment goals that will enhance and foster improvement in the standard of living of I-Kiribati \n(the people of Kiribati), faster and more equitable socioeconomic growth nationwide, and good \ngovernance-based service. Such goals are also reflected in the 2003-2007 Corporate Plan of \nthe Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Cooperatives (MCIC). The Corporate Plan will support \nnational  policy  and  five  key  areas  of  MCIC  that  focus  on  (i)  development  of  industrial, \ncooperative,  and  other  kinds  of  commercial/business  enterprises;  (ii)  private  sector \ndevelopment; (iii) improvement in both internal and external trade; (iv) attracting needed foreign \ninvestment  into  the  country;  (v)  and  improvement  in  the  regulation  of  trade  and  business \npractices.  The  Corporate  Plan  will  also  facilitate  achieving  the  projected  private  sector \ncontribution of over 20% of the country\u2019s economy with targeted average growth of more than   \n2.6% per year. Appropriate land use management, particularly proper spatial planning and \nzoning, will promote wise allocation of land that will ultimately foster sustainable use of scarce \nland resources and enhance environmental sustainability. \n \n10.  Tourism is presently the largest industry in the world. Kiritimati Island, known worldwide \nfor game fishing and scuba diving, has large conservation areas and still many unexplored \n                                                 \n9  The Minister, MELAD indicated that Cabinet recently approved 43 of the 203 outstanding cases, and the rest  \n    (160) are still being considered or may be reconsidered under the government\u2019s resettlement scheme. ", "4 \nresources. Its proximity to Honolulu will make it attractive to tourists if investment in the tourism \nindustry is increased. A multiplier effect from tourism can also provide more job opportunities to \nthe people, particularly when the Government\u2019s resettlement scheme is implemented. Overall, \nthese opportunities will facilitate the development of Kiritimati Island as a growth center in the \neastern part of the country and will ultimately result in more equitable socioeconomic growth \nnationwide.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The goal of the TA is to achieve sustainable economic growth. The purpose is to assist \nLMDK  to  improve  the  land  management  system  in  Kiritimati.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the \ninstitutional capacity of LMDK to implement the Land Planning Ordinance, the State Lands Act, \nand  government  policies  on  land  management;  and  will  streamline  the  existing  land \nmanagement system to meet the projected increasing demand for land for residential and \nbusiness  purposes,  so  that  accelerated  economic  growth  is  promoted.  The  improved  land \nmanagement system may also be applied to other state lands on the Line and Phoenix Islands.  \n \n12.  Key outputs will be (i) policy recommendations related to land management for state \nlands; (ii) updated GLUP to match the Government\u2019s vision of development of Kiritimati Island; \n(iii)  revised  existing  draft  DLUP  and  additional  DLUPs  prepared  for  priority  areas;  (iv) \nstreamlined  and  transparent  land  application  procedure  and  permit  system  (including  the \npossible threshhold for Cabinet involvement); (v) an acceptable incentive system to collect \noutstanding  rent;  (vi)  a  sustainable  system  for  maintaining  and  upgrading  the  technical \ncapabilities of LMDK, including twinning arrangements with suitable partners in the region; (vii) \nfurther staff strengthening for LMDK; and (viii) improved land management supported by a well- \nfunctioning integrated LAPLIS and GIS system. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will build on the achievements of the previous technical assistance provided by \nAusAID for strengthening LMDK. The TA will further strengthen the capacity of LMDK for land \n \nmanagement through the following activities: \n \n(i)  strengthen the implementation of the Land Planning Ordinance, the State Lands Act, \nand government policies on land management;   \n(ii)  assist the Government in updating and implementing GLUP, DLUPs, and strategy plans \nfor priority areas;  \n(iii)  address the present implementation constraints, including the need for a system for \nproper valuation of land at different sites, review land allocation procedures and permit \nsystem and identify ways to streamline the process and increase transparency, examine \nthe costs and revenues of a land management system, and recommend  incentives to \ncollect outstanding rent;  \n(iv)  develop a sustainable system for maintaining and upgrading the technical capabilities of \nLMDK, and further develop a staff training program; and ", "    5 \n(v)  strengthen the land management system by integrating the LAPLIS database and the \nGIS systems and incorporating procedural requirements of other agencies dealing with \nland management.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $375,000 equivalent, with $277,000 in foreign exchange and \n$98,000 equivalent in local currency (Appendix 2). The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance $300,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost ($277,000) and $23,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will contribute $75,000 equivalent by providing counterpart \nstaff, office space, administrative services, and data.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be LMDK within MELAD. The Government has \nassured ADB that suitably qualified counterpart staff will be assigned to the TA, and that it will \nprovide secretarial and administrative support, and adequate office space. KLLPB will act as the \nsteering committee of the TA to provide multisectoral input and guidance during implementation, \nas its present membership covers representatives of related agencies (footnote 6). The steering \ncommittee will meet at least three times to discuss the (i) implementation plan (inception report), \n(ii) midterm report, and (iii) draft final report. The consultants will submit five copies of all reports \nto ADB and LMDK, respectively. Additional meetings will be organized as necessary. Other \nstakeholders  will  be  actively  involved  by  organizing  a  stakeholder  workshop  during  TA \nimplementation  to  discuss  the  TA\u2019s  main  features.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants and the proposed work schedule are in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 9 months, beginning in April 2004 with completion in \nDecember  2004.  The  TA  will  finance  the  services  of  an  international  consulting  firm. \nInternational consultants working for 7 person-months will include a land use planning expert (4 \nperson-months,  as  team  leader)  who  has  extensive  experience  in  land  use  management \nsystem, including land tenure systems in the Pacific; an expert in land valuation (2 person-\nmonths) who has experience in valuing and classifying land; and a GIS expert (1 person-month) \nwho has experience in computerized land information systems, including MapInfo software. \nADB will recruit the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe consulting firm will be selected through the simple technical proposal and the quality- and \ncost-based selection method. Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Kiribati for Supporting Land Use Management on Kiritimati (Christmas) Island, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal   \nSustainable economic   Availability of land for   Government statistics on    \ngrowth  business development and  approved business   \ninvestment is no longer a  development and \nconstraint.  investments \nNational economic \ndevelopment indicators \nPurpose       \nAssist the Land   Business investment   Investment statistics from  Commitment to policy \nManagement Division,  increases by more than 5%  Ministry of Commerce,  reform  \nKiritimati (LMDK) to  per year.

Examine  the  need  for  classifying \napplications (e.g., based on the size of investment, area, etc.) and  suggest the \nlevel  of  final  approval  and  a  trigger/threshold  for  Cabinet  involvement  in \napproving  business  proposals.  Examine  the  need  for  lease  or  freehold \napplications to have more details on the nature of the intended use.  \n \n(v)  Thoroughly review the LAPLIS database and other available records on land \nmanagement system, and examine the costs and revenues of residential and \nbusiness leases (and residential land sales).  Recommend an incentive system \nto  collect  outstanding  revenues,  and  formulate  an  incentive  and  disincentive \nsystem  for  future  collection  of  rent  from  both  residential  and  business \nestablishments.  \n \n(vi)  Assess the training achievements of the AusAID technical assistance, and review \nthe institutional capacity of LMDK (staff capacity, technical skill, and required \nskills). Identify reasons why land management system, LAPLIS, and MapInfo-\nbased geographic information system (GIS) do not function properly. Based on \nthe review, refine/update a staff strengthening program for LMDK (training needs \nassessment) for the short- and medium-term, with indicative budgets. Training \nstaff in areas of LMDK\u2019s mandate (including LAPLIS and GIS MapInfo, and \noperation and maintenance of the systems) in coordination with other members \nof the consulting team to improve skills and to maintain sustainability of LMDK \nactivities. \n                                                 \n1 The State Land Act indicates the need to prepare a strategic plan for an area identified for development as \nresidential area. The plan will include a report proposing the number of plots that might be transferred in the next \nstrategic planning period, so sufficient land is reserved for future development needs. The strategic plan may \ninclude a land use plan prepared under GLUP/DLUP. ", "  Appendix 3  13 \n \n(vii)  To better understand land allocation procedures and mandated tasks of LMDK, \norganize consultations/workshops for concerned government agencies, private \nsector,  community  representatives,  and  nongovernment  organizations  on  the \nland  management  systems,  DLUPs  and  strategy  plans,  and  business  lease \npermit systems. \n \n(viii)  Strengthen the link between LMDK and concerned ministries, such as Ministry of \nLine and Phoenix Islands Development; Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and \nCooperatives;  and  Ministry  of  Communications,  Transport  and  Tourism \nDevelopment to increase understanding of the spatial plan, zonation, and land \nallocation under GLUP for the private sector and business investment to promote \neconomic development of Kiritimati Island. \n \n(ix)  Consolidate findings from the preceding analysis and findings of the other team \nmembers, and prepare policy recommendations for selected issues on a land \nmanagement system for government consideration.  \n \n(x)  Assist in specifying and procuring required equipment for LMDK. \n \n(xi)  Take responsibility for preparing the inception report, progress reports, draft final \nreport, and final report in full consultation with other team members, counterpart \nstaff, and ADB. \n \n2.
