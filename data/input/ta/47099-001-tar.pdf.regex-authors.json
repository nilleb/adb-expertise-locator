The government requested technical assistance (TA) during Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Management visits to Tajikistan in October 2012. It stressed the importance of private \nsector development and improving the business environment to attract private investment. ADB \nManagement  proposed  TA  to  support  economic  policy  changes  that  can  improve  growth \nprospects, support knowledge transfer, and attract potential investors to the country. \n \n2.  A reconnaissance mission was fielded in February 2013, followed by a consultation \nmission  in  March  2013.1 Discussions  were  held  with  government  agencies  including  the \nPresident's  Office,  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Trade  (MEDT),  the  State \nCommittee on Investments and State Property Management (SCISPM), and the Sugd Free \nEconomic Zone; private sector stakeholders; business associations; and development partners. \nOn 24 April 2013, the government expressed its concurrence with the ADB TA concept in the \nMarch 2013 mission aide-memoire, including the expected impact and outcome, implementation, \ncost, and financing arrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Despite a significant increase since the end of the civil war in 1997, Tajikistan has the \nlowest gross national income per capita in Central Asia ($860 in 2012). Limited employment \nopportunities in Tajikistan have encouraged up to 40% of the working population to seek jobs \nabroad.  Economic growth  has  been  mainly  driven  by  consumption, fueled  by  remittances. \nInvestment is relatively low, at about 20% of gross domestic product (GDP), which limits future \neconomic  growth  and  job  creation.3 Investment  is  largely  funded  by  the  government  and \ndevelopment partners; private investment was estimated at 4% of GDP in 2012. Given the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal constraints and limited borrowing capacity, the private sector needs to play \nan increasing role in investment. Tajikistan can benefit from increasing the share of remittance \ninflows that are allocated to investment and job creation rather than to consumption.\n \n4.  In spite of efforts to increase Tajikistan\u2019s Doing Business ranking,4 long-term private \ninvestment continues to be constrained by an unfavorable business environment that imposes \nhigh  uncertainty.  Arbitrary  taxation  reduces  the  prospects  of  fair  competition.  Financing  is \nexpensive  and  short-term,  limiting  private  investors\u2019  capacity  to  expand  and  compete \ninternationally.  Energy  supply  is  unreliable,  and  large  parts  of  the  country  do  not  receive \nelectricity during the 6-month winter period. Businesses have very limited knowledge of modern \nproduction techniques and of external markets. Just 16.7% of firms in Tajikistan reported having \nan  internationally  recognized  quality  certification  (2008).  Tajikistan  ranks  134th  out  of \n144 countries in cluster development.5 Other challenges to business include access to markets. \nOverall, Tajikistan\u2019s country risk is very high.6 As a result, the private sector has not been the \nengine of growth that Tajikistan requires. Its share of GDP has remained stable at an estimated \n                                                \n1  The March 2013 consultation mission was upgraded to a fact-finding mission on 29 May 2013. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 August 2013.  \n3  International Monetary Fund. 2012.

To attract foreign investment and technology, the government established free economic \nzones  in  which  qualified  investors  benefit  from  tax  incentives.8 However,  foreign  direct \ninvestment (FDI) remains sluggish and is yet to become the driver that was expected to help \nachieve the government\u2019s objective to increase the private sector\u2019s contribution to 66% of GDP \nby 2012. From 2009 to 2011, net FDI inflows averaged $4.1 million per year (Table 1). \nTable 1: Foreign Direct Investment in Tajikistan, 2009\u20132011 \nItem  2009  2010  2011 \nForeign direct investment, net inflows ($ million)  15.8  (14.7)  11.1 \nForeign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP)    0.3    (0.3)    0.2 \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: Foreign direct investment is the net inflow of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10% or more \nof voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital, \nreinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments. This \nseries shows net inflows (new investment inflows less disinvestment) in the reporting economy from foreign investors. \nSource: The World Bank. World Development Indicators. data.worldbank.org/indicator (accessed 25 November 2013). \n6.  Women  are  taking  on  new  responsibilities  as  male  labor  migration  has  increased. \nWomen work in the market, have small production units, and some travel as shuttle traders to \nneighboring countries. However their entrepreneurial progress is limited, especially in rural \ncommunities, by rigid notions of appropriate roles for men and women in society. Men and \nwomen have equal legal rights to land, property other than land, bank loans without the need for \nprior authorization, and contracts in their own names.  Even so, women represent a small \npercentage of registered land use owners and few women apply for loans, primarily because \nthey are not aware of their rights and do not understand the underlying procedures. \n7.  Some of the constraints faced by private investors and businesses in Tajikistan are \nbeing addressed through ongoing initiatives. ADB is supporting the development of energy and \ntransport infrastructure, and is considering project preparatory TA to support workers\u2019 skills \ndevelopment.  ADB,  GIZ,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the \nInternational Monetary Fund, and the World Bank are supporting financial sector development. \nThe World Bank\u2019s Private Sector Competitiveness Project approved in 2012 is  addressing \nfinancial infrastructure, business registration, inspections, and mining. The World Bank\u2019s Tax \nAdministration Reform Project approved in 2012 is taking forward previous support from ADB \nand the International Finance Corporation in improving the tax administration system. The GIZ \nFramework and Finance for Private Sector Development program has been strengthening value \nchains by providing business and consulting services, improving access to finance, encouraging \ncross-border trade, and promoting dialogue between policy makers, the private sector, and civil \nsociety. ADB and the European Union are supporting trade facilitation and policy.9 \n                                                \n7  The private sector share in GDP represents European Bank for Reconstruction and Development estimates based \non available statistics. The underlying concept of private sector value added includes income generated by the \nactivity of private registered companies and private entities engaged in informal activity where reliable information \non informal activity is available. \n8  The law on foreign economic zones provides tax incentives for investments of at least $500,000, which import at \nleast 90% of the technology and equipment. \n9  ADB. 2013.

Private sector development is an operational priority under ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy.10 The need to improve the investment climate and develop the private sector and \nentrepreneurship is also stressed in the country\u2019s 2010 Poverty Reduction Strategy.11 ADB\u2019s \nrecent engagement in the sector includes TA for Implementation Support for Private Sector \nDevelopment Strategy in Tajikistan, which revealed (i) the need to ensure that knowledge is \nshared in a way that it can be utilized by organizations where there is a high staff turnover; and \n(ii) the need to address weaknesses in the regulatory framework, particularly its consistent \napplication.12 The Women Entrepreneurship Development Project in the Kyrgyz Republic, 13 \nfunded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, will also provide lessons for pilot testing a \nbusiness incubator for women entrepreneurs in Tajikistan. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be an improved investment climate and business environment. The \ngovernment expects private investment to increase to at least 7% of GDP by 2020 (from 4% of \nGDP in 2012). At least 1,000 women entrepreneurs are expected to benefit from business \nincubator services by 2020. Annual average net FDI inflows are expected to reach $20 million \nfrom 2018 to 2020. The TA is expected to contribute to these targets. The outcome will be an \napproved program of economic policy reforms to improve the investment climate in Tajikistan.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA  will  be  implemented  in  two  stages.  Diagnostics,  stakeholder mapping,  and \nconsultations with the government, the private sector, business associations, and civil society \norganizations will be conducted first. This will help clarify stakeholders\u2019 willingness and ability to \nundertake different economic reforms, and identify and select ways to (i) mitigate risks that \ninvestors and businesses face when operating in Tajikistan, particularly legal and regulatory \nrisks; (ii) upgrade productive enterprises; and (iii) facilitate and encourage investments. In the \nnext stage, the TA will support the government in designing detailed blueprints for the most \nfeasible and effective institutional mechanisms and reforms. Capacity development activities for \nthe  investment  promotion  agency  (IPA)  and  for  a  pilot  business  incubator  for  women \nentrepreneurs (outputs 2 and 3) will also be preceded by a diagnostic and consultation phase. \n11.  Output  1:  Institutional  mechanisms  designed  for  implementation  of  economic \npolicy reforms to improve investment climate. The TA will prepare detailed blueprints for \nmissing institutional mechanisms that can mitigate investors\u2019 risks, help productive enterprises \nexpand, and attract investments.14 Possible institutional mechanisms to be supported include \nregulatory impact analysis for businesses; an investment protection framework, including partial \ncredit and investment guarantee schemes; support to international quality certification; support \nto innovation diffusion; and support to business incubators (Appendix 3).

Output  2:  Investment  promotion  agency\u2019s  capacity  developed. The SCISPM is \nresponsible for improving the investment climate and supporting entrepreneurship in Tajikistan. \nIt is also responsible for bringing investments into the Tajikistan economy, acting as Tajikistan\u2019s \nofficial IPA. The TA will take forward previous ADB assistance provided to the IPA (footnote 11), \nand aims to achieve quality certification for its management system. Consultants will guide the \nIPA in business process reengineering, including the development of basic knowledge transfer \ntools  such  as  a  document management  system  (simple  document  repository),  handbooks, \nguidelines, and a database for client investors. The TA will finance (i) the production of a limited \nquantity of investment promotion materials; (ii) upgrading of the IPA\u2019s website design and \ncontent; and (iii) a program of training on image building, investor facilitation, and investor \nservicing  (including  expediting  registration  and  approval  processes,  providing  necessary \ndocumentation for tax purposes, and other assistance in obtaining sites and utilities, etc.). \n \n13.  Output 3: Business incubator for women entrepreneurs developed on a pilot basis. \nModern business education is practically absent from Tajikistan. One exception is the National \nAssociation of Business Women in Tajikistan (NABWT), which provides services to its more \nthan 1,800 members.16 The TA will support a pilot business incubator for women entrepreneurs \nand the expansion of training courses to address new needs identified by NABWT members \n(e.g., basic accounting and new tax code requirements).17 Resource persons will provide short-\nterm entrepreneurship training to women entrepreneurs throughout the country. A competition \namong women entrepreneurs on innovative business proposals will select promising candidates \nfor a 3-month practical business course (a mini-master\u2019s degree in business administration). \n \n14.  TA implementation assumes stakeholders\u2019 buy-in for proposed reforms. High rotation of \ngovernment staff due to low salaries creates a risk of TA delays. The TA impact assumes that \nthere will be domestic political stability and major economic partners will continue engaging. \nInstability  in  neighboring  countries  and  perception  of  high  expropriation  risk  resulting  from \ninsufficient government efforts to fight high-level corruption may deter foreign private investment. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government \nagencies will provide counterpart support in the form of remuneration and per diem of staff, \noffice  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  logistics,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented from January 2014 to June 2016 for a total of 30 months. \nThe executing agency will be the Executive Office of the President, which will coordinate the TA \nthrough a steering committee. The implementing agencies will be the MEDT (output 1), the \nSCISPM  (outputs  1  and  2),  and  the  NABWT  (output  3).  Implementing  agencies  will  be \n                                                \n15 The OVOP is a Japanese regional development program wherein one village produces one competitive and high- \nvalue product as a profitable business to improve the village living standards.  \n16 The NABWT was founded in 1995 as a noncommercial public organization and has branches in nine cities. Its \nmandate is to expand economic opportunities for women. Its activities include improving women\u2019s business and \nvocational skills, promoting access to resources and education, and new markets. http://nabwt.tj. \n17 The pilot business incubator will provide services to start-up entrepreneurs in their first 2 years of activity, including \nsupport for communications, secretarial services, and equipment use. \n ", "  5 \nresponsible for reforms under their respective mandate: the MEDT for businesses regulation; \nand the SCISPM for investment protection and promotion, and support to entrepreneurship \n(innovation and quality certification). ADB has had good experience with all agencies.18  \n17.  ADB will administer the TA. It will engage the services of a consulting firm and resource \npersons in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Quality-  and  cost-based  selection  will  be  employed  for  the  firm  using \nsimplified technical proposals and a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. An estimated 72 person-months \nof consulting services will be needed, of which 16 person-months will be international and 56 \nperson-months  national  (Table  2).  Advance  contracting  will  be  used  to  recruit  the  TA \nconsultants. Outline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 3. Resource persons will be \nrecruited individually. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will \nfinance  the  purchase  of  limited  equipment  required  for  successful  completion  of  outputs, \nincluding hardware for the business incubator; software for the IPA\u2019s website; and investment \npromotion materials.

Objective \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will prepare detailed blueprints for missing institutional \nmechanisms that can mitigate investors\u2019 risks, help productive enterprises expand, and attract \ninvestments.  Possible  institutional  mechanisms  to  be  supported  include  regulatory  impact \nanalysis (RIA) for businesses; an investment protection framework, including partial credit and \ninvestment  guarantee  schemes;  support  to  international  quality  certification;  support  to \ninnovation diffusion; and support to business incubators. \n \n2.  The legislative process in Tajikistan does not include any systematic RIA that critically \nassess the positive and negative effects on businesses of proposed and existing regulations, \nand identify non-regulatory alternatives. Conducting RIA within an appropriate framework can \nunderpin the government\u2019s capacity to ensure that regulations are efficient and effective, and \nreduce unnecessary burden on businesses. Some form of RIA has been adopted by nearly all \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development members, although implementation \nis challenging. The TA will assess and propose possible institutional designs for a business-\noriented RIA in Tajikistan. \n \n3.  Although Tajikistan is party to a number of arbitration agreements and conventions, the \ncourts do not always respect or uphold international arbitration rulings. In May 2012, Tajikistan \nacceded to New York Convention of 1958 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign \nArbitral Awards, which should bring improvements in this area for foreign investors. The TA will \nidentify options to protect foreign and domestic investors from regulatory and political risks. \nLegal reforms to improve investors\u2019 rights to select the most favorable tax and legal regime, and \nto access international arbitration or alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, will be explored. \nIncreasing the transparency of business ownership and public access to regulatory documents \nare  options  that  can  bring  extensive  benefits.  An  internationally  recognized  investment \nguarantee facility can help address investors\u2019 concerns about political risks in the country by \nproviding political risk guarantees (insurance) for their investments. \n \n4.  Executive  documents\u2014presidential  decrees,  laws,  government  orders,  instructions, \nministerial memos, and regulations\u2014are often inaccessible, leaving businesses and investors \nunaware of existing rules. \n \n5.  The TA will help develop a strategic agribusiness product in one village in Tajikistan by \nsupporting the introduction of an internationally recognized quality certification. This pilot project \nwill use as a benchmark the Japanese One Village One Product (OVOP) approach. It will bring \nlessons that can help establish nationwide mechanisms to strengthen control over the quality of \ninputs and products, and improve the certification of quality management systems.1 At least one \nworkshop on international quality certification, product differentiation, and agribusiness value \nchain  development  will  be  conducted.  International  quality  certification  can  open  external \nmarkets to Tajikistan\u2019s products. \n \n6.  The TA will conduct a survey that will collect information about the origin and methods of \ndiffusion  of  innovation  among  Tajikistan  businesses  and  their  links  to  businesses\u2019 \n                                                \n1 N.

Other outputs include a report on private sector development, \ninnovation systems, and policy recommendations to improve innovation diffusion and business \ncompetitiveness. The following is an indicative allocation of resources and terms of reference \nthat is expected to comply with the TA requirements. However, the consulting firm can propose \na more efficient or effective allocation of consulting resources and implementation plan as long \nas it ensures timely delivery of good-quality outputs and outcome, and that the TA benefits \nreach all provinces in Tajikistan. \n \n8.  The consultants will report to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and to the Executive \nOffice of the President of Tajikistan. The consultants\u2019 reports will be first submitted to ADB for \ncomments in English, then translated into Russian and Tajik for review by the executing agency \nand implementing agencies.
