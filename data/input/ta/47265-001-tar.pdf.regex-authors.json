The Government of Armenia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  enhancement  of  its  investment  promotion  capacity,  including  for  the \npreparation of an international investment forum to be conducted in Armenia.1 An ADB fact-\nfinding mission was fielded on 7\u201314 October 2013 and an agreement was reached with the \ngovernment on the scope, monitoring framework, financing and implementation arrangements, \nand  schedule  for  a  $750,000  TA  for  Investment  Promotion.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  After  recording  12.2% average  annual growth  rates  in  2003\u20132008,  Armenian gross \ndomestic product (GDP) contracted by 14.1% in 2009, largely due to a sudden stop in capital \ninflows that disrupted the real estate and construction sectors. Gross fixed capital formation \ndeclined from 39.8% of GDP in 2008 to 23.7% of GDP in 2012. GDP per capita has been \nrecovering since 2010 and was $3,021 in 2012 but is still below 2008 levels ($3,606).3 Real \nGDP growth is expected to average 4.5% in 2013\u20132014. The national poverty rate stood at 35% \nin 2011 and is yet to recover from the 2009 economic crisis (the rate was 27.6% in 2008). \nCompetition and productivity are constrained in many sectors, particularly in nontradable goods \nand services. \n \n3.  Armenia continues to be highly dependent on external energy and financial resources. In \n2013, the current account deficit is expected to slightly decline from its 2012 level of 11.2% of \nGDP. The large trade imbalance has been covered by growing remittances, official grants and \nloans, and market-based financing. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been declining since the \nglobal financial crisis\u2014at only 4.8% of GDP in 2012 compared to 7.9% in 2008\u2014largely due to \na reduction of FDI in the construction sector. Overall, Armenia\u2019s country risk is high.4 \n \nTable 1: Foreign Direct Investment in Armenia, 2008\u20132012 \nForeign Direct Investment  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012 \nNet inflows ($ million)  925.2  724.8  561.8  447.5  473.6 \nNet inflows (% of gross domestic product)  7.9  8.4  6.1  4.4  4.8 \nNote: Foreign direct investment is the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10% \nor more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor.

This series shows net inflows (new investment inflows less disinvestment) in Armenia \nfrom foreign investors. \nSource: Central Bank of Armenia, Balance of Payments statistics. \n \n                                                \n1  The idea of an international investment forum was discussed between Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan and \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Vice-President Xiaoyu Zhao in July 2012 and July 2013. The Ministry of Economy \nsubmitted an official request for the technical assistance (TA) on 3 September 2013. On 20 September 2013, ADB \napproved  the  concept  paper  for  the  TA,  which  was  previously  designated  as  ARM:  Proposed  Capacity \nDevelopment Technical Assistance for High-Level Investment Forum. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 October 2013. \n3  International Monetary Fund. World Economic Outlook database. http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/02/ \n  weodata/index.aspx (accessed on 22 November 2013). \n4  Armenia has a high risk classification under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s \nArrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits (6, with 7 being the highest risk classification). Country risk is \ncomposed of transfer and convertibility risk (i.e., the risk of a government imposing capital or exchange controls \nthat prevent an entity from converting local currency into foreign currency and/or transferring funds to creditors \noutside the country); and cases of force majeure (e.g., war, expropriation, revolution, civil disturbance, floods, \nearthquakes). \n ", "2   \n4.  Armenia's external trade can be volatile, because most of its exports are concentrated in \na small number of product categories and are produced by a limited number of enterprises.5 \nArmenian  firms  export  only  80  products  with  comparative  advantage.6 The  lack  of  strong \ninstitutions promoting nontraditional exports (heterogeneous goods to new markets) results in a \nheavy concentration of Armenia\u2019s non-mineral exports to only a few geographical destinations. \nThe Russian Federation is the biggest export market for non-mineral goods and is the source of \n80%\u201390% of remittances. \n \n5.  Agro-processing  products,  such  as  beverages,  spirits,  and  vinegar  have  significant \nbackward linkages to agriculture but make up only about 12% of total merchandise trade. Other \nproducts that have demonstrated export potential include wine, fish and crayfish, cheeses, \ntomato paste, fresh and dried fruits, and vegetables. Many of these products are exported to \nmembers of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), where historical ties and migration \nflows have built consumer awareness and distribution channels. Armenian products, however, \nremain largely unknown to the rest of the world.7 Their quality standards, for example in food \nsafety, also require improvement to meet international standards. \n \n6.  The country needs to diversify economic opportunities and productive capabilities to \nensure sustainable economic development and poverty reduction. Success in this process will \nbe  determined  by  whether  manufacturing  firms  can  overcome  the  scale-related  cost \ndisadvantage  of  a  small  domestic  market,  and  whether  a  more  diversified  and  risk-taking \nmanufacturing base targeted to higher-value markets can be established. Attracting committed \nand specialized foreign investors\u2014particularly from the large Armenian diaspora\u2014and global \nmultinational corporations is critical for this endeavor, as they bring frontier knowledge and \nopportunities  to  integrate  Armenian  products  into  global  value  chains.  The  Armenian \nDevelopment  Agency  (ADA)\u2014the  official  investment  promotion  agency  (IPA)\u2014has  been \nunderperforming in attracting FDI compared with comparable countries.8 \n \n7.  The government\u2019s economic strategy foresees acceleration of structural transformation \nin  11  export-oriented  industrial  sectors  to  increase  export  diversification  in  products  and \ndestinations. Strategies and action plans for most of these strategic sectors have already been \napproved, and the remaining sector action plans are being finalized. Successful implementation \nof the action plans will help create jobs.9 The government is also developing an FDI strategy to \nattract committed foreign investors that are specialized in the strategic sectors. Free economic \nzones are being established to make investing in Armenia more attractive. The government will \ncontinue to pursue an economic reform agenda to simplify regulation and facilitate investments. \nInitiatives such as the elimination in 2011 of a large number of unnecessary regulations and the \nimplementation of a program of tax and customs administration reforms planned for 2013\u20132015 \nwill help improve the country\u2019s attractiveness to investors.10 \n                                                \n5  Exports in 15 product categories (of the 773 possible in the SITC4 product classification) represent 75% of \nArmenia\u2019s merchandise exports. Armenia\u2019s export basket has become extremely concentrated on minerals and \nnon-precious metals-related exports, a result mostly of real effective exchange rate appreciation in 2003\u20132008. \n6  ADB. 2013.

The 11 industrial \nsubsectors are brandy making, wine making, canned food production, water production, juice production, diamond \ncutting,  gold  and  jewelry  production,  watch  production,  precision  engineering,  pharmaceuticals,  and  textile \nproduction. \n10 Armenia ranks 37th in the World Bank\u2019s 2014 Doing Business ranking, leading among CIS countries. \n ", "  3 \n8.  Other  development  partners  are  supporting  the  government\u2019s  export-led  industrial \nstrategy  and  investment  promotion  capacities.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment is implementing the Enterprise Development and Market Competitiveness Project, \nwhich  is  helping  develop  value  chains  in  high  technologies,  pharmaceuticals  and \nbiotechnologies, food processing, and hospitality. GIZ financed an analytical study in early 2013 \nto assess existing investment promotion and facilitation policies and practices in Armenia. The \nEuropean Union is preparing a twinning project for the  ADA that includes support for the \ndevelopment  of  an  FDI  strategy.  The  World  Bank  is  designing  an  investment  project  for \nenterprise  modernization,  investment  attraction,  export  promotion,  and  quality  certification \ninfrastructure. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be increased net FDI inflows. The government estimates that FDI can \nincrease to an average of 6.5% of GDP in 2018\u20132020 from 5.4% of GDP in 2010\u20132012. The \noutcome  will  be  improved  capacity  to  bring  committed  investors  to  Armenia.  The  IPA\u2019s \nfacilitation performance score is expected to increase to at least 75% in 2016 (from 63.3% in \n2009).11 The government is expected to adopt policy actions to address binding constraints to \nprivate investment in sectors that can export strategic products. The proposed TA is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2012\u20132013 (Update),12 which includes private \nsector development as a core area of assistance, and is consistent with the draft country \npartnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 under preparation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will produce three outputs: (i) investment proposals and promotion materials \nupgraded,  (ii)  an  international  investment  forum  successfully  implemented,  and  (iii) \nrecommendations for improving the government\u2019s economic policy in strategic sectors identified. \n \n11.  The TA will finance upgrading of investment promotion materials, preparation of sound \ninvestment  proposals,  and  targeted marketing and  matchmaking  activities.  An  international \ninvestment forum will act as catalyst and end point for the investment promotion activities. The \nforum will be a private-sector-oriented event, and will mainly focus on strategic industrial sectors \nin Armenia that could benefit from foreign investment to expand their export potential. The forum \nis expected to take place in Yerevan in June 2015. The main target audience for the forum will \nbe multinational manufacturing companies that are looking to invest in Armenia\u2019s strategic \nsectors or to expand their activities in the region. The objective is to create opportunities for \nnetworking and support matchmaking between local and foreign firms by increasing foreign \ninvestors\u2019  familiarity  with  the  current  circumstances  in  Armenia,  its  business  climate,  and \nopportunities in strategic sectors. The TA will support marketing activities and international road \nshows. The forum will include focused discussions on the opportunities and export potential of \nselected strategic sectors, as well as the scope of these sectors to participate in global value \nchains. The forum will stress the opportunity to enter the CIS and European Union markets from \nArmenia  by  benefiting  from  lower  production  costs  and  a  well-educated  workforce. 13 \n                                                \n11 World Bank. 2009.

Country Operations Business Plan: Armenia, 2012\u20132013 (Update). Manila. \n13 Armenia has signed a preferential trade agreement with CIS countries; and in September 2013, the President of \nArmenia expressed his intention to have Armenia join the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia. \n ", "4   \nInternational experts (supported by resource persons, if needed) in these strategic sectors will \nbe invited to support sector discussions; undertake analysis of sector strengths, weaknesses, \nopportunities, and threats (SWOT); provide sector-specific advice; and strengthen investment \nproject proposals and their presentations. The market information collected throughout the TA \nwill be compiled and shared with all firms operating in strategic sectors in Armenia. \n \n12.  The TA will help identify policy actions needed to address major constraints to private \ninvestment in strategic sectors, as well as the export potential of strategic products in which \nArmenia  can  have  a  comparative  advantage.  This  will  help  the  government  fine-tune  its \neconomic policy for each strategic sector. Capacity development of the IPA will take place \nduring the preparation of the forum and during the follow-up activities in order to improve \ninvestor support and engagement. \n \n13.  Successful TA implementation rests on the assumptions that (i) there will be good \ncooperation between the private sector and government agencies, including sharing of complete \nand accurate data on a timely basis; (ii) Armenian businesses are willing to invest in project \npromotion in foreign countries; and (iii) the IPA\u2019s staff involved in the organization of the forum \nwill remain in the agency in the medium term. There is a risk that political or external economic \nshocks may reduce foreign investors\u2019 interest in Armenia, thereby limiting the expected impact \nof FDI net inflows. Uncertainty regarding free trade agreements with regional economic blocs \nmay also reduce investor interest (footnote 12). It is assumed that the government will continue \nto  be  committed  to  further  improving  the  business  environment  and  expanding  economic \nopportunities, and will be able to generate consensus around economic reforms. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of venue rental, food and beverages, forum-related \nmaterials, marketing and advertising, interpreting services directly related to the forum, travel \nand per diem of selected resource persons, remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation, office supplies, logistics, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from January 2014 through December 2015. \nThe Ministry of Economy will be the executing agency and the ADA will be the implementing \nagency. \n \n16.  Considering the private-sector-oriented nature of the TA, a steering committee with \nrepresentatives from the public and private sectors will be established. The committee will be \nchaired  by  the  Minister  of  Economy  and  will  have  full  oversight  over  TA  implementation. \nInternational financial institutions, bilateral development partners, and investment intermediaries \nwill be invited to sponsor the forum and will be regularly consulted. Armenian businesses and \nbusiness  associations  will  also  help  identify  multinational  companies  to  be  targeted  for \ninvestment partnerships. \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nArmenia and the European Union had been negotiating the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, but the \ntalks were interrupted after the announcement of Armenia\u2019s intention to join the Customs Union. \n ", "  5 \n17.  The TA will require 10 person-months of international and 26 person-months of national \nconsulting  services.  ADB  will  engage  the  services  of  an  international  consulting  firm \n(professional event organizer) that will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedure will be employed in recruiting the firm using biodata technical proposals. Individual \nconsultants and resource persons will be recruited by ADB on an individual basis in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Table 2 \ndescribes  the  consultant  inputs  and  areas  of  expertise.  All  procurement  will  be  done  in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). All \nequipment procured under the TA will become the ADA\u2019s property.
