", "   \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will synthesize lessons learned from the experiences of  \n(i) the east\u2013west partnerships for poverty reduction, (ii) community-driven development (CDD), \nand (iii) new microcredit systems, and propose how these three methods can be combined in \nthe western provinces. The TA will consider previous work, and hold discussions with east\u2013west \npairs to improve and deepen their partnerships. It will define workable poverty-reduction project \noptions using the three approaches, and incorporate a randomized evaluation process that can \nbe  used  to  monitor  results  of  the  new  project  options  and  provide  feedback  for  further \nrefinement.  Missions  visited  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  from  30  August\u201310 \nSeptember  2010 to  determine the  objectives, scope,  and  implementation  arrangements.  A \nmemorandum of understanding was signed with the State Council Leading Group of Poverty \nAlleviation  and  Development  (LGOP)  and  its  Foreign  Capital  Project  Management  Center \n(FCPMC) on 10 September 2010.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC has made significant progress in poverty reduction. Based on the official \nannual per capita poverty line of CNY1,196 ($175), the number of people living in absolute rural \npoverty has decreased from an estimated 250 million in 1978 to 35.97 million in 2010.2 However, \nsignificant challenges remain. Poverty has become increasingly centered in rural and more \nisolated parts of the country. It is more prevalent among vulnerable groups, such as those living \nin remote or environmentally threatened areas, the elderly, women, and members of ethnic \nminorities. Although the government is putting more resources into poverty reduction, the rate of \ndecline in poverty has been slowing markedly. Recent research has indicated that new forms of \npoverty and inequality are rising.3    \n \n3.  Various poverty reduction approaches have been tried in the PRC since 1995. One has \nbeen  the  east\u2013west  partnerships  for  poverty  reduction.  In  1996,  the  LGOP  held  the  first \nCongress of East-West Cooperation, where it paired 10 western provinces with 13 eastern cities \nand provinces and provided guidelines for voluntary cooperation between the pairs. The eastern \npartners  are  not  required  to  provide  funding,  but  moral  suasion  is  used  by  the  national \ngovernment to encourage support. The five types of support are (i) cash grants, (ii) industrial \ncooperation to encourage private investment from east to west, (iii) labor mobilization, (iv) social \nmobilization, and (v) staff capacity building. Eastern provinces and cities, through medium-term \nagreements, currently provide cash, training, and personnel through secondments to 15 poorer \nprovinces in the western regions. However, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) research on the \ninstitutional aspects of the east\u2013west partnerships completed in December 2009 showed that, in \nsome cases, donations from the eastern partners had been declining because of pressures \ncaused by the global financial crisis and a lack of sufficient incentives to continue increasing \nsupport.4 The partnerships appear to be both durable and beneficial, but can be enhanced to \nmake them more effective. During a workshop to discuss the research results and subsequently \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 23 April 2010. \n2   National Statistics Office. 2010.

Institution and Innovation of East\u2013West Pairing-Off Regional Cooperation for Poverty \nReduction in China. Report from subproject 2.8 of Facility for Policy Reform and Poverty Reduction (TA 4933-\nPRC). Beijing: ADB. ", "2 \nduring  the  fact-finding  for  this  TA,  the  four  western  provinces  of  Gansu,  Guangxi-Zhuang \nAutonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Yunnan asked for ADB support \nto help improve their poverty reduction activities.5 \n \n4.  A second approach to poverty reduction has been the devolution of some development \nfunds and decision-making to villages, known as community-driven development (CDD). LGOP \nhas conducted CDD pilot projects with ADB involvement since 1998, with six TA projects \nexceeding $4.3 million in value.6  The pilots have established the foundation for more advanced \nCDD initiatives, some of which have nongovernment organization (NGO) involvement. Field \nreviews demonstrate that CDD has resulted in more cost-effective public goods provision as a \nresult  of  villagers  taking  decisions  and  managing  the  funds  themselves.  However,  some \nsimplification may be needed and the legal question of allocating funds to villages when they \nare  not  registered  institutions  has  been  raised.  In  addition,  the  roles  of  NGOs  and  local \ngovernments may need to be refined. \n   \n5.  A third approach has been microcredit, which has also been actively supported by ADB \nwith numerous TA projects since the mid-1990s. Microcredit has been provided in three main \nways: (i) by LGOP through the Agriculture Bank of China and the Agriculture Development Bank \nof China; (ii) by rural credit cooperatives to farmers; and (iii) through an expansion of institutions \nproviding microcredit services, stimulated by the People's Bank of China and the China Banking \nRegulatory Commission.7 Recently, LGOP has also established village cooperative funds, which \nreceive small grants and use a group guarantee model for lending to villagers. The scaling up of \nmicrocredit  to  increase  geographic  and  client  coverage  has  been  limited  because  of \nweaknesses in the models and regulatory restrictions. The next phase of LGOP activities in \nmicrocredit needs to encourage sustainability, and better engagement between small farmers \nand formal financial institutions.     \n \n6.  Provinces  are  currently  considering  the  potential  to  reduce  poverty  through  a \ncombination of various forms of agricultural enterprises, support for labor migration to cities, and \nimprovements to schools, community centers, and other infrastructure.  However, questions \nhave been raised about the sharing of profits in agricultural enterprises, labor demands and \navailability  when  farming  systems  change,  a  shift  in  focus  from  increasing  economic \nopportunities to improving household access to services, and household management of risk. \nOther  concerns  have  been  raised  about  the  environmental  sustainability  of  changes,  food \nsecurity, market development, and the best form of agricultural enterprises, including farmer \ncooperatives. It is important that efforts to reduce poverty support not only income from farming \nbut also the large number of additional smaller income-generating activities rural households \nundertake,  such  as trade  and  processing  of agricultural  products.  Reviews  are  needed  of \n                                                \n5  The results were presented and discussed with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), \nLGOP, and representatives from four east\u2013west pairs in a cosponsored workshop on 2 March 2010. \n6  ADB. 1998.

", "3 \nchanges in the way intergovernmental transfers and international loan repayments are managed \nand of gender mainstreaming. The results of the pilots need to be synthesized into a set of \nguidelines for general field application. The three approaches (east\u2013west activities, CDD, and \nmicrocredit) are complementary and the potential for combining them needs to be developed.  \n \n7.  The proposed TA will help the PRC consolidate, combine, and expand the successful \nwork done over the last 10 years. It will address some of the broader poverty questions raised \nabove,  including  ensuring  gender  mainstreaming.  By  laying  down  essential  principles  for \napplication of each of the three approaches and of combinations of them, the government can \nhelp to guide poverty reduction processes at the provincial level. In this way the effectiveness of \nthe east\u2013west partnerships can be improved, thus further reducing poverty and inequality in the \nwestern provinces.8   \n \n8.  The government's priorities for poverty reduction were defined in the Eleventh Five-Year \nPlan, 2006\u20132010 and at the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2007. \nThey can also be found in ongoing consultations to develop the Twelfth Five-Year Plan and in \nthe forthcoming 10-year plan for poverty reduction. The goal is to establish a harmonious \nsociety through balanced and people-centered development. The government has proposed a \nscientific approach to addressing growing development gaps between rural and urban areas, \nbetween  western provinces and coastal regions, and  between the poor and more affluent \npopulations. An emphasis on rural development will continue under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, \nand may be deepened to include rural industrial expansion.  \n \n9.  The TA is fully consistent with both the government strategy for poverty reduction and \nthe ADB country partnership strategy.9  The emphasis of the country partnership strategy is on \nsupporting  the  PRC  in  its  work  to  ensure  environmentally  sustainable  development  and \ninclusive  growth.  This  includes  balanced  regional  development,  rural  infrastructure,  skills \ntraining,  financial  sector  reforms,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  development,  and \nsustainable rural ecosystem management. All of these aspects are present in the proposed \napproach. Enhanced poverty reduction models can specifically address rebalancing, as well as \nimproving rural livelihoods and reducing both poverty and household risks.     \n \nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be more effective east\u2013west partnership agreements signed \nand funded. The outcome will be enhanced systems for poverty reduction formally established \nfor east-west pairs, including current east\u2013west support areas, CDD, and microcredit.  \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Using the east\u2013west partnerships as the anchor, the TA will study and suggest ways of \nadding CDD and microcredit to the essential elements of the east\u2013west partnerships: grants, \nsecondments, and new business investments. The TA will analyze the activities and results of \neast\u2013west partnership activities, CDD, and microcredit, as well as gender issues, to better \nunderstand the key elements for success. The outputs will be reports showing (i) lessons \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n                                                \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n8  This TA will also benefit from lessons and activities being undertaken under RETA 7543 ADB. 2010.

Description drawn from \npage 15. \n ", "4 \nlearned, and documentary guidelines for use of each of these three approaches to poverty \nreduction in the PRC; (ii) three models that combine the approaches; and (iii) systems to \nconduct randomized evaluations of the results of the proposed models. \n \n12.  The TA will assess and define policy, operational, institutional, and technical aspects of \nthe east\u2013west partnerships, CDD, and microcredit, incorporating gender issues throughout the \nprocess. Reviews of documents, detailed discussions with the FCPMC and provincial poverty \nofficials, brainstorming exercises with field practitioners, and field visits and case studies in the \nwestern provinces will be used to produce the outputs. Specific attention will be paid to: \n \n(i)  the best way to attract private investment from eastern to western rural areas;  \n(ii)  building capacity to strengthen east\u2013west partnerships at county, township, and village \nlevels;  \n(iii)  experiences  of  village  cooperative  funds,  particularly  targeting  methods  for  poor \nhouseholds, and methods of expanding outreach;  \n(iv)  forms of agricultural enterprises that will maximize farmer incomes and eliminate the \nneed for subsidies or soft loans to enterprises or farmer cooperatives;  \n(v)  improved  CDD  models  that  are  less  time-consuming  and  more  effective,  including \ninvolving new types of NGOs, and the role of local government; and \n(vi)  the use of the randomized evaluation methods to monitor and evaluate poverty reduction \nprojects. \n \n13.  The TA will focus on establishing principles to guide poverty reduction expenditure \nrelated to east\u2013west partnerships, CDD, and rural and agricultural credit. The principles will be \nbased on both research and experience to date, and will be reviewed and discussed with \nstakeholders and practitioners. They may be applied at both national and provincial levels, and \ncan help determine investment priorities and approaches.   \n \n14.  Specific  models  blending  east\u2013west  partnerships,  CDD,  and  microcredit  will  be \ndeveloped, based on the principles, prior experience, and the needs of the western provinces. \nModels will need to be sufficiently flexible to enable provinces with very different needs and \ncircumstances to use them. They will incorporate aspects of timing and phasing of different \napproaches to maximize synergy, and will incorporate rigorous methods of evaluation to help \ndemonstrate results. They will be developed and discussed in detail with east\u2013west pairs and \nother interested stakeholders, then modified accordingly for field application.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $425,000 equivalent, of which the government \nhas requested ADB to finance $300,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014other sources). The government will provide \n$125,000 equivalent in-kind for counterpart staff, work space and logistics support, information \ngathering, and selected training costs. The TA will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem of \nconsultants, as well as training, workshops, and miscellaneous expenses. The detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The  TA  is  expected  to  begin  in  December  2010  and  end  in  January  2012,  an \nimplementation period of 13 months. The proposed executing agency and implementing agency \nfor the TA is the FCPMC of LGOP. Other ministries and offices are expected to be consulted, ", "5 \nincluding  the  Ministry  of  Finance, the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  the \nMinistry of Transport, the Ministry for Water Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture,  and  the  four  east\u2013west  paired  provinces  that  have  been  regularly \nengaged in the consultative process. The executing agency will provide the necessary office \nspace, counterpart staff, transportation, logistical and travel arrangements, and other relevant \nservices to the consultants and will arrange meetings and appointments with relevant agencies \nand organizations. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  recruit  one  international  expert  (2  person-months,  intermittent)  for \nrandomized  evaluation.  Four  national  consultants  (13  person-months,  intermittent)  will  be \nrecruited  for  CDD,  rural  finance,  east\u2013west  partnership  implementation,  and  rural \nindustrialization. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The \ninternational and national consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis by \nADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time \nto time). International and national consultants will work together under the direction of LGOP \nand with other national ministries and agencies and eastern and western provincial officials as \nappropriate.  The  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will finance training, \nseminars, and conferences. These costs will be administered by the executing agency using an \nadvance payment facility. The executing agency has administered numerous ADB TA projects \nand five World Bank loans, and has adequate capacity to manage the funds. \n \n18.  The  TA  provides  numerous  opportunities  for  information-sharing  and  knowledge \nproducts. ADB will involve, on an informal basis, a group of interested technical staff, continuing \nan interdepartmental group that begun in 2009 to engage in discussions about the PRC poverty \nreduction and village participatory approaches. The group will provide guidance and support, \nincluding additional research references and useful international experiences, and will advise on \ndraft principles and models through the project officer.  \n    \nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the East-West Partnerships for Poverty \nReduction, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms    Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nMore effective east\u2013west  Partnership agreement  NDRC annual meeting  Synthesizing several methods will \npartnership agreements  incorporating new  documents on east\u2013west  be more effective in areas with \nsigned and funded  elements in at least two  partnerships  more difficult poverty problems \npartnerships by end 2013     \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nEnhanced models for  poverty  New model framework  NDRC annual meeting  East\u2013west partners will wish to \nreduction with microcredit,  for east\u2013west poverty  documents on east\u2013west  deepen financing and capacity \nCDD, and gender balancing  reduction relationships  partnerships  building arrangements to add new \nformally established for east\u2013 with elements for    elements \nwest pairs  microcredit, CDD, and   \n  gender by end 2012  Risks \nSome eastern provinces and cities \nmay not wish to codify a long-term \nrelationship for poverty reduction \n \nGovernment may not wish to \ntransfer financial resources and/or \ndelegate poverty reduction project \nadministration to NGOs \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
