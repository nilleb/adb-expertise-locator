The INO-CS is to be provided as a single tranche \nloan  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Public sector management (economic and public \naffairs management) \nTheme (subtheme): Economic growth (promoting macroeconomic \nstability)  \nLocation impact: National (high) \n \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \nThe Program  The global crisis that intensified after September 2008 has affected the \nRationale  Indonesian economy in four related respects: (i) the first-round effects of \nthe global financial crisis had repercussions for the domestic financial \nsector, leading to significant capital flight and exchange rate depreciation \nin  the  second  half  of  2008;  (ii)  the  second-round  effects  of  global \ndemand destruction have hurt the real economy, resulting in a slowdown \nin  economic  growth  from  the  fourth  quarter  (Q4)  of  2008  until  now; \n(iii) the crisis has had feedback to fiscal policy, resulting in a decline in \ntax  revenue  collection  and  a  wider  government  budget  deficit  than \ninitially planned, at a time of limited access to global credit markets; and \n(iv)  the  economic  impacts  threaten  to  undo  recent  gains  in \nunemployment and poverty reduction.  \nIn the context of the second-round effects on the real economy and the \nemerging fiscal constraint, the Government of Indonesia has requested \nADB to provide a countercyclical support loan of $500 million to support \nits  public  expenditure  program  for  2009.  The  request  for  financing \nstemmed from the Government\u2019s concerns to ensure predictability in its \nbudget financing, given the necessity for a temporary fiscal stimulus \nwithin its medium-term fiscal program. The Government projects gross \nfinancing requirements for 2009 at $24.5 billion, including domestic and \nexternal debt that matures in 2009. Net financing (after amortization) for \n2009 is projected at $13.6 billion, of which 64% will need to be raised in \nthe second half of 2009. Therefore, the INO-CS will provide additional \nfinancing to the Government for its larger fiscal stimulus in 2009 and \n2010. This will allow the Government to stimulate an economic recovery, \nprotect  its  social  spending  and  poverty  alleviation  programs,  and \ncontinue with its longer-term development objectives in 2009 and 2010.   \nThe Government\u2019s fiscal policy response to the economic slowdown has \nbeen swift and broadly effective. Like most other developing economies, \nthe  national  government  budget  does  not  have  automatic  stabilizers \n ", " ii \n \nembedded on the expenditure side of the budget. Therefore, with the \neconomy  quickly  decelerating  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008,  it  was \nnecessary for the Government to announce an additional countercyclical \nfiscal program in February 2009 to compensate for the fall in private \nconsumption and investment and focusing on tax relief, carrying over \n2008  infrastructure  projects,  increasing  capital  spending  and \nmaintenance, expanding flagship social assistance programs, and policy \nmeasures to speed up disbursements of critical public spending. Overall, \nthe  Government's  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus  amounts  to  about \nRp113 trillion.  \n \nADB  staff  estimates  that  without  this  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus \npackage, economic growth would be between 2.0% and 3.0% in 2009. \nADB  staff  estimates  also  show  that  informal  employment  and \nunemployment  could  rise  by  more  than  1.8 million  persons.  Poverty \ncould also increase by about 3 million\u20134 million persons or about 1\u20132 \npercentage points of the population\u2014reversing recent gains in poverty \nreduction.  \nThe INO-CS is anchored by ADB\u2019s existing Development and Policy \nSupport  Program  (DPSP)  series.  Under  the  DPSP  series,  reform \nmeasures  relating  to  debt  and  fiscal  policy  management  have \ncontributed  considerably  to  lower  levels  of  debt  to  GDP  and  a \nconsiderable increase in non-oil tax revenues. Rating agencies have \nalso cited debt reduction and the Government\u2019s commitment to reforms, \nincluding changes to the investment law, customs and tax reforms, and \nfiscal reforms\u2014all activities supported by the DPSP\u2014as the reason for \nrecent sovereign rating upgrades. Policy actions supported under the \ninvestment  climate  have  led  to  significant  improvements  in  business \nstart-up times, value-added tax (VAT) refund times, and establishment of \na sounder and sustainable financial safety net. Important steps were \nalso  established  to  help  lay  the  groundwork  for  improving  poverty \ntargeting of basis services. As the 2005 fuel price hike made available \nmore funds for social spending, the DPSP series supported building \ncapacity  in  government  institutions  to  create  a  more  evaluative \ninstitutional  framework  that  would  improve  the  targeting  of  these \nreleased  funds.  Lessons  from  targeting  were  incorporated  into  the \nreactivated cash transfer program that accompanied the May 2008 fuel \nprice increase. \n   \nObjective, Scope,  The  objective  of  the  INO-CS  loan  is  to  provide  support  for  the \nand Coverage of  Government\u2019s countercyclical spending program for 2009 and therefore \nLoan  ensure predictability in its budget financing, given limited market access \nand  the  need  for  a  temporary  fiscal  expansion.  This  will  allow  the \nGovernment  to  stimulate  the  economic  recovery  in  2009  and  2010, \nprotect  its  social  spending  and  poverty  alleviation  programs  and \nobjectives, and continue with its longer term development objectives.   \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $500,000,000  under  the \nINO-CS  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n ", "  iii \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  plus  200  basis  points  (bps);  a  5-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. \n   \nPeriod and  The period specified for the INO-CS will be from 1 September 2009 to \nTranching  31 December 2010, with a single tranche loan of $500 million to be \ndisbursed  when  the  Government  has  met  the  conditions  for  loan \neffectiveness.\n \n   \nCounterpart  The Government will use the local currency counterpart funds generated \nFunds  by the loan proceeds to help maintain current social expenditure and \ninfrastructure spending. \n   \nExecuting Agency   Ministry of Finance (MOF)  \n   \nImplementation  MOF will be the Executing Agency to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate \nArrangements  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  countercyclical  expenditure \nprogram  supported  by  the  loan.  MOF  with  BAPPENAS  and  the \nCoordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  have  established  the \nmonitoring  arrangement  for  the  Government's  countercyclical \nexpenditure  program.  MOF  will  be  the  focal  for  monitoring \nmacroeconomic  performance.  BAPPENAS  will  be  the  focal  for \nmonitoring implementation of the Government's programs and projects \nsupported  by  the  INO-CS  loan.  ADB  will  meet  with  MOF  and \nBAPPENAS on a quarterly basis to discuss implementation progress. \nADB will provide a report to the Board of Directors on a semiannual \nbasis.  \n   \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs \nDisbursement  (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in \nADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed \nby other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements \nfor Program Loans. \n   \nBenefits and  The INO-CS will provide significant benefits and have a positive impact \nBeneficiaries  on the economy and the poor because of the following:  \n(i)  Higher infrastructure spending will generate long-term growth, \nstimulate investment, create jobs, and raise incomes. \n(ii)  The INO-CS will help close the budget financing gap within a \nmedium-term  fiscal  program,  thereby  supporting  economic \ngrowth and macroeconomic stability. \nRisks and  The loan supplements financing from other ADB programs such as the \nAssumptions  proposed the Fifth Development Policy Support. The DPSP is firmly \nembedded in the Government\u2019s national medium-term development plan \n(RPJM)  \n \nRisks include the following:  \n(i)  The global financial crisis has hurt Indonesia. A prolonged global \n ", " iv \n \nrecession will place further stress on the fiscal situation and the \nbudget  financing  gap.  A  weakening  economy  and  increased \nstress  in  the  labor  market  will  result  in  increased  poverty \nincidence in 2009. However, this will be partially offset through \nsocial assistance programs and the increase of infrastructure \ndevelopment in 2009 and 2010. \n(ii)  The  absorptive  capacity  of  key  spending  agencies  may  be \nstretched,  affecting  the  timeliness  and  effectiveness  of  the \ncountercyclical  expenditure  program.  The  Government  has \nintroduced several policy measures to expedite disbursements \nand this will mitigate some of these constraints. \n(iii)  Some  social  assistance  programs  and  infrastructure  are \nvulnerable  to  leakages,  poor  targeting,  and  corruption.  The \nGovernment is committed to addressing these problems through \ninstruments such as public financial reforms, enhancement in \nprocurement  practice,  and  its  anticorruption  and  anti-money-\nlaundering efforts.  \n ", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Countercyclical  Support.  The  development  policy  letter \nconfirming  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  implement  its  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus \nprogram and its medium-term development program is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE                                            \nCOUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY \n2.  The  proposed  loan  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  (CSF)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) comes at a critical time for Indonesia. 1  It is designed to maintain the \nmomentum of its economic recovery and key development efforts at a challenging time of \nlimited access to global financial markets and the first global recession since World War II. The \nglobal crisis that intensified after September 2008 has affected the Indonesian economy in four \nrelated respects: (i) the first-round effects of the global financial crisis had repercussions for the \ndomestic financial sector, leading to significant capital flight and exchange rate depreciation in \nthe second half of 2008; (ii) the second-round effects of the sharp contraction in global demand \nhave hurt the real economy, resulting in a slowdown in economic growth from the fourth quarter \n(Q4) of 2008 until now; (iii) the crisis has had feedbacks to fiscal policy, resulting in a decline in \ntax revenue collection and a wider government budget deficit than initially planned, at a time of \nlimited access to global credit markets; and (iv) the economic impact of the global financial crisis \nthreatens to undo recent gains in unemployment reduction and poverty reduction.  \n3.  Given the second-round effects on the real economy and the emerging fiscal constraint, \nthe Government of Indonesia has requested ADB to provide a countercyclical support loan of \n$500 million to support its public expenditure program for the second half of 2009 and 2010. \nThe  request  for  financing  stemmed  from  the  Government\u2019s  concerns  about  ensuring \npredictability in its budget financing, given the necessity for a temporary fiscal stimulus in 2009 \nand its continuation in 2010. The Government projects gross financing requirements for 2009 at \n$24.5 billion, including domestic and external debt that matures in 2009. Net financing (after \namortization) for 2009 is projected at $13.6 billion, of which 64% will need to be raised in the \nsecond half of 2009 (Table 4). Therefore, the INO-CS will provide additional official financing to \nthe Government for its larger fiscal stimulus in 2009 and 2010, while the costs of servicing the \nexisting debt are also projected to rise. The Government has met the access criteria under the \nCountercyclical Support Facility (Appendix 2). \n4.  Adverse effects of the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis has adversely \naffected the economy. This impact is manifested in several ways. While domestic consumption \ngrowth remained positive in the first semester of 2009, partly supported by the Government\u2019s \neffective fiscal stimulus, economic growth weakened to 4.0% in Q2 2009 from 4.4% in Q1, and \nis projected to weaken further in the second semester compared with 6.1% economic growth in \n2008. The contraction in exports of 27% in the first semester of 2009 and collapse in foreign \ndirect investment were the key factors behind this sharper than expected economic slowdown.2 \nIndonesia is also experiencing temporary fiscal stress because of the economic slowdown. Tax \nrevenues declined by 6.2% in the first semester of 2009 over the same period in 2008 and non-\ntax revenue (primarily natural resource revenues) declined by 33% over the same period. Debt \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Enhancing ADB\u2019s Response to the Global Economic Crisis\u2014Establishing the Countercyclical Support \nFacility. Manila.  \n2  Imports declined by 36% in the first semester of 2009 over the same period in 2008 in line with the fall in exports \nand softening domestic demand. \n ", "2   \ninterest costs are now projected to rise by an additional $1 billion in the revised 2009 national \ngovernment budget because of higher interest rates on government debt issuances. The 2009 \nnational government budget deficit is now projected to widen from the original programmed \ndeficit of 1.0% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 2.5% of GDP, which is still relatively low by \ninternational standards, reflecting the Government\u2019s prudent fiscal stance.  \n \n5.  Sound  macroeconomic  management.  The  Government  has  maintained  sound \nmacroeconomic management and introduced preemptive measures to manage the increased \ndownside risks to the domestic financial sector and external position. This is reflected in an \nimprovement in the external balance, with gross international reserves equivalent to 6 months of \nimport cover and servicing of official external debt, a low inflation environment, and a sound \nbanking sector. The Government has operated a prudent fiscal policy for the last several years, \nwhich has resulted in a continuous decline in Indonesia\u2019s public debt\u2013GDP ratio from over 55% \nin 2004 to around 32% at the end of 2008. \n \n6.  Prudent fiscal response. The Government\u2019s fiscal response to the crisis has been swift \nand  effective.  It  announced  a  countercyclical  spending  program  in  February  2009.  The \ncountercyclical program focuses on (i) providing substantial tax cuts to boost household income \nand payroll tax relief to firms operating in labor-intensive industries to protect jobs, (ii) expanding \ncapital  expenditure  and  carrying  over  the  2008  infrastructure  projects,  increasing  capital \nmaintenance and material spending, and (iii) scaling up key social assistance programs. \n \n7.  Fiscal  space  and  debt  sustainability.  In  the  context  of  its  debt  level,  the \ncountercyclical spending program is expected not to adversely affect debt sustainability as a \nlarge proportion of the 2009 budget stimulus is temporary in nature. A cross country comparison \ndrawing on IMF publications indicates that Indonesia is well placed to sustain its debt at prudent \nlevels (Appendix 9 Table A9.2). A more recent IMF country study finds that a primary surplus of \n0.3% of GDP will stabilize debt below 30% of GDP (Appendix 4).  \n \n8.  Donor  coordination.  The  INO-CS  is  an  outcome  of  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment  and  coordination  with  development  partners  under  existing  loan  programs  to \nIndonesia, and complements the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP)3 and the Public \nExpenditure Support Facility (PESF).4 The DPSP is a series of five annual, single-tranche loans \nsupporting the development policy agenda of the Government as envisioned in the national \nmedium-term  development  plan  (RPJM),  and  cofinanced  with  the  World  Bank  and  the \nGovernment of Japan. The cluster aims to help the Government achieve its medium-term \ngrowth and poverty reduction objectives through four core policy areas: (i) macroeconomic \nstability  and  creditworthiness  through  continued  monitoring  of  macroeconomic  indicators; \n(ii) improving the investment climate through regulatory reforms, tax and customs reforms, and \nstrengthening financial sector and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) access to finance; \n(iii) improving public financial management and governance by strengthening budgeting, internal \ncontrol systems, transparency and procurement, and civil service reform; and (iv) improving \ndelivery  of  public  services  to  the  poor  through  pro-poor  targeting  of  public  programs  and \nstrengthening community-driven development. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008.

Under the DPSP series, reform measures relating to debt and fiscal policy management \nhave contributed considerably to lower levels of debt to GDP and a considerable increase in \nnon-oil tax revenues. Rating agencies have also cited debt reduction and the Government\u2019s \ncommitment to reforms, including changes to the investment law, customs and tax reforms, and \nfiscal reforms\u2014all activities supported by the DPSP\u2014as the reason for recent sovereign rating \nupgrades.  Policy  actions  supported  under  the  investment  climate  have  led  to  significant \nimprovements  in  business  start-up  times,  value-added  tax  (VAT)  refund  times,  and \nestablishment of a sounder and sustainable financial safety net. Important steps were also \ntaken to help lay the groundwork for improving poverty targeting of basis services. As the 2005 \nfuel price hike made available more funds for social spending, the DPSP series supported \nbuilding capacity in government institutions to create a more evaluative institutional framework \nthat  would  improve  the  targeting  of  these  released  funds.  Lessons  from  targeting  were \nincorporated into the reactivated cash transfer program that accompanied the May 2008 fuel \nprice increase.  \n \n10.  In response to global financial market failure in September 2008 and subsequently \nIndonesia\u2019s restricted access to credit markets at that time, development partners (ADB, the \nGovernment of Australia, the Government of Japan, and the World Bank) approved the PESF. \nAs a stand-by loan facility, its key objective is to provide insurance in the event that global \nfinancial markets fail again as in Q3 2008. The access conditions to the funds include an \ninability to meet specified quarterly financing targets within agreed market access conditions \nand the continued maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework. Since then, \nglobal financial markets have begun to stabilize. Therefore, it is projected that the PESF funds \nwill not be disbursed in 2009 as market conditions improve relative to September 2008. The \nPESF  established  a  structured  mechanism  for  crisis-related  policy  dialogue  between \ndevelopment partners and the Government. It also established a macroeconomic monitoring \nmechanism  through  which  quarterly  reports  and  meetings  between  the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners are held. This mechanism will be used to monitor the macroeconomic \nperformance under the INO-CS (paras. 47\u201351). The formulation of the INO-CS has greatly \nbenefited from this consultative and monitoring process, as it has been an invaluable vehicle for \nproviding the Government with input on its countercyclical fiscal program, additional measures \nto mitigate the increased downside risks to the macro economy, and ways to strengthen poverty \nmonitoring and coordination efforts (Appendix 7).   \n \nIII.  THE GLOBAL CRISIS AND COUNTRY CONTEXT \n \nA.  The Global Crisis and its Impact on the Indonesian Economy, Employment, and \nPoverty \n \n11.  The global economic downturn, triggered by the collapse of the US subprime mortgage \nmarket, has turned into one of the sharpest global economic recessions in modern history. Most \ndeveloped economies are in deep recession in 2009, and the pace of economic growth in \ndeveloping countries has declined significantly, and in some cases has become negative. The \nlatest International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections suggest that economic growth in developed \ncountries this year will contract by 3.8%. The volume of world trade is expected to fall by 12.2% \nand foreign direct investment is estimated to fall by about 30% from 2008 levels. The IMF also \nprojects that the global economy will only moderately recover next year, as financial market \n ", "4   \nstabilization  will  take  longer  than  previously  envisioned.  Developing  countries\u2019  access  to \ninternational credit markets will remain curtailed as a consequence. 5 \n \n12.  First-round effects of the global financial crisis. Spillovers from the global financial \ncrisis on the Indonesian financial sector\u2014mainly equity markets and the balance of payments\u2014\nwere particularly severe in Q4 2008 and more so than in most other regional economies. Equity \nprices  fell  by  50%  and  investors  unbundled  financial  portfolios,  resulting  in  a  decline  of \n$6.5 billion in gross international reserves in Q4 and a 31% depreciation in the rupiah exchange \nrate from November 2008 to February 2009. Spillovers to the domestic banking system have \nbeen relatively muted because of the limited exposure to troubled US assets, and low exposure \nto securitization and off-balance sheet activities. The banking system remains sound, with a \ncapital asset ratio of 17% and gross nonperforming loans at under 5% as of June 2009.    \n  \n13.  However, the global credit crunch that started in mid-2008 and intensified in Q4 2008 \nhurt the Indonesian economy by making access to international and domestic credit markets \nmore expensive for both the public and private sectors. Yields on Indonesian domestic bonds \npicked up since mid-2008 and spiked sharply in October to as high as 20%, and spreads \non  Indonesia\u2019s international bond surged by about 650 basis points (bps) (Figure 1e). This was \ndue to a rapid increase in domestic lending of about 30%, in part attributable to the squeeze on \nUS dollar lines, and capital outflow and the associated rupiah exchange rate depreciation. \nElevated risk perceptions about the Indonesian financial sector and economy have limited \nIndonesia\u2019s access to international credit markets and raised the cost of borrowing.  \n \n14.  Second-round effects of global demand destruction. Indonesia is experiencing the \nsecond-round effects of the global economic downturn. Initially, it seemed the impact of the \nglobal downturn on Indonesia\u2019s growth conditions was moderate. Economic growth was 5.5% in \nQ4 2008 and a respectable 4.4% in Q1 2009. The latest economic data from the Central Bureau \nof Statistics indicate that the economy is weakening, with growth at 4.0% in Q2 2009 on a year-\non-year basis. Moreover, the data show that public expenditure on goods and services has \nbeen  the  main  engine  of  growth  in  the  first  semester  of  2009,  followed  by  household \nconsumption, benefiting from one-off election spending and tax cuts implemented as part of the \nstimulus package. Private consumption and investment growth are weakening and exports have \nseverely contracted (Figure 1a). As a consequence a negative output gap (actual economic \ngrowth below potential growth) of between 3.0% and 4.0% has emerged in 2009 (Figure 1b). In \nJanuary 2009, year-on-year export values had fallen about 36%. Although the rate of decline \nhas slowed, export values are still down by 27% in June 2009 on a year-on-year basis. Import \nvalues have also contracted by 36% in the first half or 2009 because of lower commodity prices \non resource exports, declining imports of components for the export sector and falling domestic \ndemand. Inflow of remittances also declined by 15% from $1.3 billion in Q4 2008 to $1.1 billion \nin Q2 2009 suppressing incomes of poorer families reliant on remittances. ADB staff estimates \nthat without the fiscal stimulus package implemented in the first half of 2009, economic growth \nwould have been between 2.0% and 3.0% (Appendix 3).   \n \n15.  With this background, the Government revised its macroeconomic framework in June \n2009 and now projects growth of 4.3% for 2009 with higher unemployment and poverty. The \nIMF and ADB staff project economic growth at 3\u20134% for 2009 because of suppressed export \ngrowth  and  falling  investments.  However,  because  of  lower  trade  intensity,  Indonesia\u2019s \nvulnerability to export fluctuations is less than its neighbors. These projections translate to \n                                                 \n5  International Monetary Fund. 2009. World Economic Outlook Update: Contractionary Forces Receding But Weak \nRecovery Ahead. Washington, DC (July). \n ", "                           5\n    \nreduced per capita incomes from about 4.5% in 2008 to 1.5%-2.8% in 2009. Past experience \nwith these lower growth rates suggest adverse effects for employment generation and poverty \nreduction (para. 17). \n \n16.  The  global  financial  crisis  and  economic  downturn  affects  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nposition  in  three  ways.  First,  the  tight  liquidity  in  global  credit  markets  and  elevated  risk \npremiums on Indonesian sovereign debt have increased the cost of financing the budget and \nrefinancing public debt. The government finances have been especially vulnerable because of \nthe country\u2019s large gross financing needs. During normal market conditions, Indonesia was able \nto  raise  a  sufficient  amount  (in  the  range  of  $12  billion\u2013$13  billion)  from  domestic  and \ninternational  markets  in  2007  and  2008.  Tighter  global  liquidity  and  higher  risk  premiums \ncombined  with  high  gross  financing  needs  have  raised  interest  rates  on  Indonesian  debt \ncompared  with  other  economies  in  the  region.  Consequently,  debt  interest  costs  are  now \nprojected to rise by an additional $1 billion in the revised 2009 budget. Second, with weakening \neconomic growth, the Government needs to provide a fiscal stimulus in 2009 and 2010. Third, \nthe collapse in commodity prices and a slowing economy have resulted in a decline in budget \nrevenues of about 13.6% in the first semester of 2009 over the same period in 2008. Income tax \ncollections have declined 4.5%, customs collection declined by 16.5%, and non-tax collection \n(including  resource  revenues)  declined  by  33%  (Figure  1f).  Tax  cuts  as  part  of  the  fiscal \nstimulus  also  contributed  to  the  decline  in  tax  revenue  collection  in  2009.  As  a  result  of \nincreased spending and decline in budget revenues, the 2009 budget deficit is now projected to \nwiden from the original programmed deficit of 1.0% to 2.5% of GDP, which is still relatively low \nby international standards reflecting the Government\u2019s prudent fiscal stance. It is programming a \nbudget deficit of 1.6% of GDP for 2010 to maintain the fiscal stimulus, given the projected \nfurther weakening of the economy.  \n \n17.  Poverty  alleviation  and  employment.  The  poverty  rate  has  fallen  by  about \n1 percentage point per year since 2003, reaching 17.8% in 2006, and falling further to 14.2% in \nearly 2009. However, poverty remains a serious problem in absolute terms in Indonesia with \nover 35 million people below the national poverty line and another 42% of the population \nvulnerable to falling into poverty if their circumstances suddenly deteriorate. Indicative of this \nvulnerability to poverty, the labor market has severely weakened in recent months. Figure 1d \ndescribes rising labor market stress in 2009. Four years of solid economic growth generated 2.7 \nmillion formal jobs (defined as regular wage jobs) from 2005 to 2008, of which 1.6 million were \ncreated  in  2008.  Coinciding  with  robust  employment  growth  was  a  continuous  decline  in \nunemployment from 11.5% of the labor force in 2003 to 8.1% in 2008. According to the latest \nhousehold labor survey carried out in February 2009, employers have significantly reduced \nhiring activity, with only about an additional 400,000 formal jobs created from February 2008 to \nFebruary 2009. On the other hand, the informal sector continues to expand with more than an \nadditional 2 million workers now engaged in informal activities (defined as casual workers, self-\nemployed, and unpaid family workers). The Government is concerned that the current global \nfinancial crisis will have adverse effects on its efforts to reduce poverty if there is a significant \nreduction in economic growth, retrenchments, and shrinking employment opportunities. Recent \nretrenchment data from the Department of Manpower and Transmigration point to increased \nlayoffs, particularly in the export sector. Based on the current low growth scenario of 3\u20134.% \ngrowth  for  2009,  ADB  staff  estimates  that  only  about  half  a  million  formal  jobs  would  be \ngenerated and informal employment and unemployment would rise by more than 1.5 million \npersons. ADB staff estimates also show that without the fiscal stimulus informal employment \nand unemployment could have risen by more than 1.8 million persons. Poverty could have also \nincreased  by  about  3  million\u20134 million  persons  or  about  1\u20132  percentage  points  of  the \npopulation\u2014reversing recent gains in poverty reduction.  \n ", "6   \nB.   The Government's Macroeconomic Management \n \n18.  Appropriate and responsive policy. The Government\u2019s macroeconomic policy stance \nto the increased downside risks to the economy from the global crisis has been appropriate and \nresponsive. Stability is reflected in the improvement of key macroeconomic indicators. On the \nexternal side, earlier concerns about external risks to the balance of payments arising from \ncorporate rollover and domestic resident capital outflows did not materialize. Foreign reserves \nhave stabilized since November 2008 to $57.9 billion at the end of August 2009, sufficient to \ncover 6 months of imports. Conventionally, at least 3 months of import coverage is considered a \nsufficient buffer against modest shocks to the balance of payments. On the monetary side, Bank \nIndonesia has broadly operated an appropriate monetary policy stance throughout the crisis. In \nearly 2008, it raised interest rates to counter the threat of second-round inflationary pressures \narising from the surge in global commodity prices. It then shifted to an expansionary monetary \nposition at the end of 2008 to provide sufficient liquidity to the banking system against the \nbackdrop of rapidly falling inflation. Inflation fell to 2.7% (year-on-year) in July 2009, from its \npeak of 12.1% in August 2008. Inflation is expected to remain benign for the rest of this year, \nindicative of the slump in domestic economic activity and lower commodity prices.  \n \n19.  The Government\u2019s response to mitigating the risk of the global financial crisis on the \nIndonesian  economy  was  swift  and  involves  a  number  of  proactive  measures  aimed  at \nreassuring confidence in the domestic financial sector, increasing liquidity in the banking system, \nand strengthening Bank Indonesia\u2019s lender of last resort facility. To maintain the confidence and \nstability of the financial system, the Government (i) issued a financial safety net regulation that \nclearly  establishes  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and  procedures  that  govern  the  actions  and \nresponses of Bank Indonesia, the minister of finance, and the Deposit Insurance Corporation in \nthe event of the failure of a financial institution; (ii) strengthened the role of Bank Indonesia\u2019s \nlender of last resort facility by allowing banks to borrow in the short term from the central bank, \nbacked up by high quality assets such as government bonds and Bank Indonesia Certificate; \n(iii) increased coverage of the deposit insurance scheme; and (iv) eased liquidity in the banking \nsector through monetary expansion. Policy measures on the latter include gradually cutting \nBank Indonesia policy rates from 9.5% in December 2008 to 6.5% by August 2009, injecting \nrupiah  liquidity  through  repurchase  agreements,  and  reducing  the  reserve  requirement  for \nforeign currency deposits. With these proactive measures in place, indicators show signs of \nimprovement. Bank liquidity eased at the end of 2008, and growth in bank lending started to \npick up to about 16% in the first semester of 2009 on a year-on-year basis; the stock market \nand the rupiah exchange rate recovered ground since December 2008; and yields on short-term \ndomestic bonds have declined, although yields on medium- and longer-term bonds remain \nelevated indicating a steeper yield curve compared to prior the global financial crisis.  \n \n20.  To strengthen the external position, the Government arranged multilateral and bilateral \nswap arrangements to gain ability to call for more foreign reserves when needed. For example, \nIndonesia has access to a $14.6 billion swap facility with the People\u2019s Republic of China. In this \ncontext of slowing exports and waning market confidence, Bank Indonesia has activated its \nrediscount window for trade receivables and the Government has established an export\u2013import \nfinancing agency that would provide different trade finance products, including export credit \nguarantees, as well as a mandate to support diversification of export markets and SMEs\u2019 access \nto trade finance.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "                           7\n    \n \nFigure 1: Key Economic indicators \n \n \n \n(a)  Economic Growth in 2009 by Major Expenditure Group     (b)  Potential and Actual Economic Growth \n \n        (% first semester growth year-on-year)                    (1980 \u20132009)                                   \n   \n    30 9\n    20 7\n    10 5\n    owth 0 3\n        % gr--2100 consumptionPublic ConsumptionPrivate Investment Exports Imports --131198119831985198719891991199319951997199920012003200520072009\n    -30 -5\n    2007 2008 2009 Actual Growth Potential growth\n        (c)  Export and Import Growth (year-on-year)       (d) Changes in Employment and Unemployment \n                                              (in number of persons) \n   \n    80.0 3000\n  2500\n  60.0  \n  2000\n  oy) 40.0 1500  \n          % growth (y--242J0000a....n0000-05May-05Sep-05Jan-06May-06Sep-06Jan-07May-07Sep-07Jan-08May-08Sep-08Jan-09May-09 -11-5050000000000 2005-07 2007-08 2008-09\n-1500\n    -60.0\n    Exports Imports Informal emp Formal emp Unemployed\n             \n     (e) Spreads on Sovereign Dollar Bonds                                   (f) Budget Revenues in 2009 over 2008     \n \n                                                                                                               Levels (first semester, Rp trillion) \n \n \n  1200\n300\n    1000\n250\n    800\n    600 n200\n     240000 Rp trillio110500\n   \n0 50\n      1-Jan 1-Feb1-Mar1-Apr1-May1-Jun1-Jul1-Aug1-Sep1-Oct1-Nov1-Dec 1-Jan1-Feb1-Mar1-Apr1-May1-Jun1-Jul 0 Income tax Customs Non-tax\n \n  Philippines East Asia Indonesia Malaysia\n  2008Q1 2009Q1\n \nNote:  Formal  employment  defined  as  regular  wage  employment.

Fiscal situation. With the sharp fall in global demand in Q4 2008 and the spillovers of \nthe  crisis  to  the  domestic  economy,  as  well  as  the  recognition  by  the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners that a larger fiscal expansion is needed, the Government revised the \n2009 budget in February 2009 and again in July 2009 to accommodate weaker economic \nprospects and the projected decline in tax collection, and provide additional fiscal stimulus \nmeasures. It now projects a national government budget deficit of 2.5% of GDP up from 1.0% \nas originally programmed, and up from a 0.1% budget deficit in 2008. The revised budget \ntranslates to a fiscal expansion of 2.4% of GDP from the 2008 budget, which is low by regional \nstandards. ADB staff projects that tax revenue collection will be slightly weaker than in the \nrevised budget. At the same time spending by line ministries is expected to be about 5% below \n ", "8   \ntheir revised budget. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to be slightly lower at 2.4% of \nGDP.  The  actual  fiscal  stimulus  component  of  the  fiscal  expansion  (incremental  budget \nspending and tax measures to stimulate the economy) is estimated at 1.4% of GDP. It covers \nabout one third of the expected negative output gap this year (i.e., the gap between potential \nand actual economic growth), suggesting the fiscal stimulus will have a moderate impact on \nstimulating  an  economic  recovery  (Appendix  3).  The  revised  budget  has  increased  gross \nfinancing needs from $18.2 billion to $24.5 billion for 2009. \n  \nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators for Indonesia, 2004\u20132009 \n \n  Fiscal Year \nItem  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009a \nA.

At the same time, despite Bank Indonesia reducing its policy rate by 300 bps since \nQ3 2008,  domestic  commercial  lending  rates  remain  relatively  high\u2014partly  because  of \nincreased risk premiums and also because of substantial government bond issuances this year. \nThis may have contributed to the decline in private investment growth in Q2 2009 (Figure 1a). \nBank Indonesia's policy interest rates are at a historical low and monetary policy easing will be \nlimited going forward. Therefore, the Government plans to maintain supportive role of fiscal \npolicy. The outgoing Government targets a deficit of 1.6% of GDP in 2010, although this \n ", "                           9\n    \ntranslates to a modest fiscal contraction of up to 0.8% of GDP over the 2009 revised budget. \nADB staff project the budget deficit for 2010 slightly higher in the order of 1.8% of GDP on the \nback of less optimistic macroeconomic projections, revenue collections and the possibility for a \nslightly  larger  second  round  fiscal  stimulus  program  in  the  2010  budget  than  currently \nanticipated. The Government also recognizes that budget stability could be improved over the \nmedium term by further reducing the subsidies in the budget, enhancing budget execution, \nexpanding the tax base, and strengthening tax administration. Based on the Government\u2019s \ncommitment to fiscal prudence and overall sound macroeconomic management, the three major \nrating agencies have maintained the Indonesia sovereign credit ratings at 2008 levels of B1 \npositive (Moody\u2019s); BB-stable (Standard and Poor\u2019s), and BB stable (Fitch).  \n \nTable 2: Budget and Fiscal Projections \n(trillion Rp) \n      2009  2010 \n  2007  2008  Initial  Proposed  ADB  Proposed   ADB  \n  Budget  Revised  Projections  Budget  Projections \nItem  Budget \nA.

Significant risks and challenges remain. The risks of the uncertain global economic \nand regional recovery on Indonesia\u2019s recovery and financial market are large. While some signs \nhave emerged that the export decline may have bottomed out, the weak external environment is \nexpected to continue to depress export performance. Weakening trade flows and economic \ngrowth are projected to continue to affect government revenue negatively. On budget financing, \nwhile the PESF has helped improve the Government\u2019s access to the capital market and yields \non sovereign debt have improved significantly since May 2009, domestic bond yields remain \nelevated above pre-crisis levels and bond tenures have shortened significantly. As a result of \nhigher  interest  rates,  the  Government\u2019s  interest  costs  are  projected  to  increase  by  about \n$1 billion in 2009. In real terms, bond yields have actually widened significantly because of \ndeclining inflation since early 2009 (Figure 2a). Issuing bonds at reasonable prices will continue \n ", "10  \nto be a challenge going forward since market conditions are expected to remain volatile, as \nexperienced in the first half of the year (Figure 2b). In addition, although the Government has \nraised about 80% of its market financing needs as of August 2009, it still needs to raise a \nsignificant  amount  (Rp85  trillion,  64%)  in  terms  of  net  financing  in  the  second  semester \n(Table 4).  \n \nFigure 2: Bond yields and Net Foreign Buying of Rupiah Bond \n \n(a) Domestic Real Bond Yields 2008\u20132009           (b) Net Foreign Buying (billion Rp)   \n20.0\n18.0 6000\n16.0\n14.0 4000\n12.0\n10.0 2000\n8.0\n6.0 0\n4.0\n2.0 -2000\n0.0\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul\nJan-08 Apr-08 Jul-08 Oct-08 Jan-09 Apr-09 Jul-09 -4000\n    Inflation 5Y-Domestic Bond Yield   -6000\n \nSources: Ministry of Finance. \n \n \nIV.  THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S COUNTERCYCLICAL FISCAL STIMULUS PROGRAM \n  \n24.  The Government\u2019s fiscal policy response to the economic slowdown has been swift and \nbroadly effective. Like most other developing economies, the national government budget does \nnot have automatic stabilizers embedded on the expenditure side of the budget. Empirical \nevidence for Indonesia suggests that only two budget items have historically exhibited a relation \nwith the economic cycle\u2014government purchases of goods and services, and debt servicing\u2014\nand the former has exhibited a distinct pro-cyclical response.6 Debt servicing costs have been \ncountercyclical  because  of  the  non-discretionary  nature  of  debt  service.  Government  bond \npremiums tend to rise during economic downturns along with currency depreciation. On the \nrevenue side, there appear to be modest automatic stabilizers, i.e., tax revenues and non-tax \nrevenues fall during downturns. Therefore, with the economy quickly decelerating in Q4 2008, it \nwas necessary for the Government to announce a national budget in February 2009 that was \ncountercyclical  focusing  on  increasing  priority  capital  spending  and  carrying  over  some \ninfrastructure projects from 2008, substantially increasing the materials and capital maintenance \nbudget, expanding flagship social assistance programs, and providing tax relief to businesses \nand  households.  The  Government  also  announced  additional  stimulus  spending  on \ninfrastructure and maintenance in July 2009 as part of its fiscal stimulus efforts. Overall, the \ncountercyclical  component  of  the  budget  is  estimated  at  Rp113  trillion.  To  enhance  the \neffectiveness of the countercyclical spending program the Government also introduced policy \nmeasures to speed up disbursements of critical public spending.  \n \n25.  The  Government  intends  to  undertake  a  second-round  fiscal  stimulus  in  the  2010 \nnational government budget focusing on infrastructure spending. The INO-CS will support the \nGovernment\u2019s infrastructure investments included in the revised 2009 budget and the 2010 \nbudget aimed at improving the welfare of targeted groups in the social sector, and especially \n                                                 \n6  International Monetary Fund. 2009. Indonesia: Selected Issues, IMF Country Report No. 09/231, Washington, DC \n(July). \n ", "                           11\n    \ncompetitiveness enhancing projects in the agriculture sector, the traditional distribution sector, \nand other investments with a clear development impact. It will also support scaling up of the \nsocial assistance programs in 2009 and its maintenance of this spending in 2010 (Table 3 and \nthe development policy letter in Appendix 1). A mechanism for monitoring implementation of the \nGovernment\u2019s countercyclical fiscal stimulus program has been established under the INO-CS \n(paras. 47\u201351). \n \n26.  Composition of the countercyclical fiscal stimulus. The central government budget \ndeficit is projected to increase from 0.1% of GDP in 2008 to 2.5% in 2009, which translates to a \n2.4% fiscal expansion. Overall, the countercyclical component of the budget amounts to Rp113 \ntrillion or about 2.1% of GDP to support domestic demand. Of this, about half stem from lower \nincome taxation and other tax exemptions and 36% from infrastructure, maintenance and other \nexpenditure  items.  Scaling  up  social  assistance  programs  account  for  the  rest  of  the \ncountercyclical program (Figure 3). The tax cuts were motivated and designed to have had an \nimmediate impact on stimulating household consumption as infrastructure spending is only \nexpected to have an impact in the second semester of 2009 and 2010 because of the longer \ntime involved in the procurement and disbursement process. The countercyclical fiscal stimulus \npackage announced in February 2009 was incremental to additional countercyclical spending \nthat has been incorporated into the 2009 budget.  The Government more than doubled capital \nmaintenance  spending  and  increased  material  spending  in  the  order  of  Rp25  trillion  with \nimmediate and significant stimulus effects in 2009 (Table 2). \n \n \n  Figure 3: Composition of Fiscal Stimulus Measures\n   (trillion Rp)\n \n  16\n \n \n \n \n  56\n \n \n41\n \n \n \n \n  Tax Cuts Infrastructure and Maintenance Social Assistance\n \nSource: Ministry of Finance budget reports. \n \n \n27.  Temporary components of the countercyclical fiscal stimulus. About 56% (0.7% of \nGDP) of the fiscal stimulus package is attributed to one-off or temporary policy measures, which \nwill be reversed once economic recovery sets in. These include the stimulus spending on \ninfrastructure and temporary payroll tax relief to businesses and indirect tax relief to families. At \nthe same time the 2009 budget includes a one-off election related spending and contingent \n ", "12  \nfiscal risk reserve of about 0.4% of GDP. The underlying (cyclically adjusted) budget deficit for \n2009 is therefore estimated at about 1.4% of GDP. 7 \n \n28.  Tax cuts. The tax cuts are a combination of temporary tax rate cuts to provide financial \nrelief to families and enterprises in labor-intensive sectors, and permanent rate reductions in line \nwith the Government\u2019s longer term tax reform program to increase tax registrations and the tax \nbase. The permanent tax cuts include lower personal and income tax rates and the increase in \nthe taxable income threshold to Rp15.8 million per year (benefiting mainly low-income earners) \neffective  from  January  2009.  The  tax  cuts  appear  to  have  had  an  immediate  impact  on \nstimulating  household  consumption  in  Q1  2009.  These  measures  are  expected  to  boost \nhousehold incomes by about Rp43 trillion (about $4 billion) in 2009, although some proportion \nwill be saved\u2014reducing the stimulus effect. With the onset of the economic slowdown, the \nGovernment introduced further temporary tax relief (such as reduction in VAT on cooking oil, \nimport duties on raw materials and capital goods, and payroll tax relief for firms in labor-\nintensive sectors) projected to total about Rp13 trillion. While the permanent tax cuts will reduce \nrevenue in the short term, some of the revenue loss will be recovered in the medium term \nthrough improved competitiveness of the economy and tax administration. \n \nTable 3: Indonesia\u2014Selected Infrastructure and Social Assistance Programs \nBudget Allocations in  Implementation \nTargeted Beneficiaries     2008, 2009 and 2010  Progress \nProgram  Program Description \nfor 2009  (where applicable)  (as of August \n2009) \n \nInfrastructure Programs \n \n    Competitiveness Enhancing Investments in the productive sector \n         \n1.

Infrastructure.  The  Government  has  announced  a  series  of  infrastructure  projects \nspecifically to support its fiscal stimulus efforts in 2009 and 2010 with a strong development \nfocus (Table 3), in addition to capital spending already in the pipeline for the 2009 budget. \nThese include projects already in the investment pipeline but with procurement advanced by 12 \nmonths ahead to have an impact in the second semester of 2009 and 2010. Other infrastructure \nprojects  are  new  and  designed  for  the  fiscal  stimulus  as  quick-disbursing,  labor-intensive \nprojects. The projects are also selected to have a social welfare impact (such as housing for \npoor families in remote coastal fishing villages) and are designed to enhance competitiveness in \nselected  sectors  especially  agriculture  and  downstream  sectors  such  as  the  traditional \ndistribution  sector  and  SMEs  operating  in  these  sectors.  These  include  enhancing  rural \nproductivity projects (construction and rehabilitation of feeder roads and irrigation in rural areas); \nenhancing  competitiveness  in  the  traditional  distribution  system  (construction  of  traditional \nmarkets  and  SME  support);  and  economy-wide  competitiveness  enhancing  projects \n(construction of national infrastructure). As noted above, the Government also doubled capital \nmaintenance spending in 2009 which are quick-disbursing, labor-intensive activities including \nnational road reparation, repairs to school buildings, health facilities etc. These competitiveness \nenhancing infrastructure and SME programs will continue in the 2010 budget.     \n \n30.  Social  assistance  programs.  The  Government  has  scaled  up  its  flagship  social \nassistance programs as part of its longer term reform program and also to mitigate the poverty \nimpacts of the economic slowdown. In recent years, the Government has introduced better \ntargeted social assistance programs in response to lessons learned from the 1998 economic \ncrisis  where  the  absence  of  effective  social  assistance  programs  resulted  in  substantial \nincreases in poverty. The new programs include the unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program \nfirst introduced in 2005 and its offspring program the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program \ncurrently  under  pilot  testing.  The  community-based  development  program  in  rural  areas \n(Kecamatan Development Program) and in urban areas (Urban Poverty Project) were pilot \ntested  after  the  1998  crisis,  and  recently  rolled  out  on  a  national  level  as  the  National \nCommunity Empowerment Program Mandiri (PNPM). Under the PNPM, the central Government \nprovides  block  grants  to  communities  for  community-based  development  projects  in \ninfrastructure, social and productive economy. \n \n31.  Cash transfer programs. In 2008, the Government reactivated the UCT program to \ncompensate poor households for the surge in commodity and food prices. The UCT program \ncovered 18.5 million households based on the database used in the previous UCT in 2005 and \n2006. Each household received Rp100,000 per month on a quarterly basis. Available data \nabout the antipoverty effectiveness of the UCT are encouraging. According to data from the \n2008 National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS), the UCT maintained the welfare levels of \n60% of recipient households and assisted 30% of recipient households to escape from poverty, \nwhile about 10% of households under the scheme fell into poverty because of food price \ninflation in 2008. The Government had extended the UCT program for 2 months in 2009 \n ", "                           15\n    \ncovering 18.5 million households. It was suspended in the lead-up to the national legislative \nelections in May 2009 and the presidential elections in July 2009. The CCT program is in pilot \nstage and covers about 720,000 households in 13 provinces. Families receive Rp100,000 per \nmonth conditional on meeting achievements on selected child education and health targets. The \nGovernment intends to use some of the proceeds of the INO CS loan to enhance the CCT \nprogram in 2010. \n \n32.  Other programs. The Government has allocated a total of Rp10.4 trillion for the PNPM \nfor  2009,  of  which  Rp0.7  trillion  was  added  as  part  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  package.  The \nOperational Aid to School Program (BOS) is the largest program and provides block grants to \nneedy  elementary  schools.  In  addition,  the  Government  provides  for  payment  of  health \ninsurance premiums for the poor under the Government's new social health insurance scheme. \nThese programs have advantageously placed the Government to channel resources to the poor \nin a timely and transparent manner, and thereby mitigate the worst effects of the economic \ndownturn and external shocks on the poor. \n \n33.  These social assistance programs are the pillars of the new poverty reduction framework \nintroduced in response to the current global crisis. In March 2009, the Government issued a \npresidential regulation on coordination of national poverty reduction efforts. The decree helps \ncoordinate and streamline the implementation of poverty reduction efforts at national and local \nlevels. The decree outlines the functions, responsibilities, and organization of the coordination \ncommittees for poverty reduction at national, provincial, and district levels. At the national level, \nthe  coordination  committee  is  led  by  the  coordinating  minister  for  social  welfare,  with \nmembership from all ministries. At the provincial level, the committee is chaired by the provincial \ngovernor and at district level by the district mayor or regent. The committees will have three \nprogram clusters focusing on social safety net programs, community empowerment programs, \nand  microcredit  and  small  business  development.  With  the  decree,  the  Government  will \nharmonize and streamline interventions from some 60 community-based projects executed by \n22 sectoral ministries. This will enable the Government to respond more efficiently to poverty \nimpacts  from  the  global  financial  crisis.  Supporting  the  framework,  the  Government  is \nestablishing a poverty monitoring mechanism designed to provide a timely assessment of the \npoverty impact of the current global financial crisis to stakeholders. \n \n34.  Subsidies. The central government budget still contains sizeable subsidies intended to \nprotect the welfare of the poor (such as subsidies applied to rice, gasoline, kerosene, and \nelectricity, among others) amounting to 14% of the central government budget in 2009. However, \nthese subsidies are poorly targeted and with leakages and the overall results in terms of net \nwelfare to intended recipient groups are mixed. While the Government has cut the share of \nsubsidies in the budget by half from 5.6% of GDP in 2008 to 2.9% of GDP in the revised 2009 \nbudget,  there  is  still  substantial  room  to  cut  them  back  further  and  allocate  savings  to \ndiscretionary  countercyclical  spending  in  social  assistance  programs  and  infrastructure. \nRecognizing the need to contain these subsidies, the Government is finalizing its regulatory \nframework for determining and allocating subsidies within the central government budget.   \n \n35.  Strengthening public financial management. The effectiveness of the Government\u2019s \nfiscal  stimulus  package  depends  on  better  budget  execution.  The  key  spending  agencies \n(Ministries  of  Education,  Health,  Public  Works,  Communication  and  Transportation)  have \nrelatively low absorptive capacity rates, causing delays in disbursements and procurement that \ncould  undermine  the  Government\u2019s  stimulus  package,  especially  with  its  record  of  under-\nexecution (especially in capital spending) and back-loaded spending toward the end of the year. \nFor  example,  only  about  19%  of  programmed  capital  spending  was  disbursed  in  the  first \n ", "16  \n5 months of 2008. To address the low disbursement rates in the first semester of the fiscal year, \nMOF  implemented  a  series  of  measures  at  the  end  of  2008  aimed  at  accelerating  the \nprocurement process and utilization of savings from the 2008 budget outturn. These measures \nincluded (i) implementing a campaign to promote advance procurement processing, appoint \nmultiyear treasury officers, and speed up disbursements through the Treasury; (ii) establishing a \nmonitoring committee for the budget activity list 2009 to improve budget disbursements; (iii) \nimproving the recording and reporting system in budget spending units; and (iv) issuing a series \nof circulars with simplified mechanisms and processes for carryover of unspent 2008 budget. \nThese measures have improved the disbursement rates of government expenditure, especially \ncurrent and social assistance. The measures provided a modest improvement in disbursement \nrates of capital spending in the first semester of 2009. The overall disbursement rate of line \nministries and agencies in the first semester of 2009 was 35.8% of the total 2009 budget, up \nfrom 28.5% in 2008 and 28.1% in 2007.  \n \n36.  Under  the  public  financial  management  reforms,  the  Government  is  introducing \nmeasures aimed at addressing problems with leakages and corruption with programs. This is a \nlong-term effort that is also shaped by the regional autonomy implemented since 2001. These \nmeasures include (i) developing a medium-term expenditure framework supplemented with a \nfiscal  policy  framework;  (ii)  program  and  performance  budgeting;  and  (iii)  modernizing  the \ntreasury system, including the establishment of a consolidated Treasury Single Account, and a \nfinancial management information system. Other supporting measures include unification of the \nplanning and budgeting processes, a revised chart of accounts and budget classification, new \ntreasury processes, and improved internal and external auditing. In addition, the Independent \nAnticorruption Commission (KPK) has been making substantial progress in investigating and \nprosecuting  senior  government  officials  involved  in  corrupt  practices  and  this  has  helped \nimprove Indonesia\u2019s global rankings in control of corruption.8 The oversight body has improved \nimplementation of the Government's PNPM Mandiri program.  \n \nV.  ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE COUNTERCYCLICAL PROGRAM \n \n37.  The economic stimulus effects. The fiscal stimulus package is projected at 1.4% of \nGDP, covering about half of the estimated output gap for 2009 (negative output gap estimated \nat about 3.0%\u20134.0% before the stimulus). On this basis, the stimulus appears to be of an \nappropriate size. ADB assessment indicates that the fiscal multiplier of the package could be \n1.5%\u20131.6% of GDP, depending on the type of fiscal stimulus, their multiplier effects, and their \ntiming (Appendix 3). For example, the total tax breaks of Rp56 trillion are likely to expand GDP \nby  less  than  this  amount  as  some  proportion  will  be  saved,  while  the  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure and social assistance spending of Rp57 trillion is likely to stimulate the economy \nby up to Rp68 trillion (assuming a multiplier of 1.2). The tax cuts, social assistance programs \n(especially the UCT) and the boost in capital maintenance spending have had an immediate \nimpact on household consumption. Some of the larger infrastructure projects, however, will take \nup to 12 months to have an impact because of the longer procurement and disbursement period. \nADB staff estimates that, without the stimulus package, economic growth for 2009 would be \nbetween 2.0%\u20133.0%. \n \n                                                 \n8  The World Bank governance indicators show that Indonesia\u2019s global ranking for control of corruption has improved \nsubstantially since 2000. Indonesia was ranked at the bottom 14.1 percentile in 2000, meaning that 86% of all \ncountries in the index had a higher score than Indonesia. In 2004, Indonesia\u2019s ranking improved to 18.9. It jumped \nto the 31st percentile in 2008, meaning that 69% (instead of 86%) of all countries have a better score. Indonesia\u2019s \nranking in Transparency International\u2019s corruption perceptions index also improved to 126 in 2008 from 133 in \n2004. \n ", "                           17\n    \n38.  Poverty impacts. An economic slowdown from 6% in 2008 to a projected 3.0%\u20134.0% in \n2009 will reduce the growth in per capita incomes from about 4.5% in 2008 to 1.5%\u20132.5% in \n2009. Based on experience with similar low growth rates, such as in 2001 to 2004, poverty is \nlikely to increase in the short term. Over the medium term, a slow economic recovery will create \npersistently higher unemployment and suppressed earnings in the informal sector as new labor \nmarket entrants outnumber new jobs created. The Government\u2019s fiscal stimulus through quick-\ndisbursing labor-intensive programs will and has partially offset the unemployment and poverty \nimpacts of the crisis. However, an economic growth rate of about 6% per annum in 2011 is \nnecessary to ensure a sustained reduction in unemployment and poverty (Appendix 3).  \n \nVI.  OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND COVERAGE OF THE LOAN \n39.  The Government has requested a loan of $500,000,000 under the CSF from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 200 bps; a 5-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; commitment charge of 75 bps on the undisbursed loan balance; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement presented to the Board. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n40.  The gross financing needs of the Government have increased from $18.2 billion in 2008 \nto $24.5 billion in 2009 based on the revised 2009 budget. These growing financing needs \nreflect increased levels of domestic and foreign debt principal repayments, and changes to the \n2009 budget. The revised 2009 budget projects a lower increase in revenues because of the \neconomic slowdown, and the need for additional spending to stimulate the economy in 2009 \nand  for  poverty  alleviation  programs.  Overall,  the  Government  is  budgeting  for  additional \nspending and countercyclical spending up to Rp113 trillion in 2009. The Government plans to \nmeet the financing needs from the following sources: (i) $13.8 billion from issuance of domestic \nand international bond issuance in the markets, (ii) $5.4 billion from the banking system and \nexcess financing from 2008, and (iii) $6.6 billion from the Official Development Assistance \nprogram and project lending (excluding the PESF). The Government will draw down the PESF \nand related support from other development partners when it cannot meet its financing targets \nfrom  the  markets  within  specified  market  access  conditions  specified  in  the  Government\u2019s \nfinancing plan and other conditions set out in the PESF loan agreement.  \n \nVII.

Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n44.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the INO-CS. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the INO-CS. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the INO-CS shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the INO-CS. \n \n45.  An update of the country\u2019s financial management systems was assessed for the INO-CS. \nThis assessment draws on recent economic and sector work undertaken by the World Bank, \nADB,10 and  is  anchored  in  the  results  of  a  public  expenditure  and  financial  assessment \nconcluded in June 2008.11 Based on this assessment, the fiduciary arrangements proposed for \nthe INO-CS remain acceptable. Over the past 12 years, substantial progress has been made in \nimproving the regulatory framework for improved public financial management, under the troika \nof laws (The 2003 Law on State Finance, The 2004 State Treasury Law, and the 2004 State \nAudit  Law),  and  other  complementary  laws  on  planning  and  procurement,  and  related \nimplementing regulations. The Fiscal Policy Office within MOF has a mandate to undertake \nmacro-fiscal projections and analysis. Budget documentation and disclosures to the public have \nimproved. A fiscal risk statement is now included in the annual budget documents\u2014making \nIndonesia one of the pioneers in fiscal risk analysis among emerging market economies. A more \nrecent focus has been on improving budget execution to avoid under-spending, as allocation of \nfunds and the implementation of budget remain serious constraints. The 2007 government cash \nmanagement regulations have contributed to consolidating government bank accounts, and \nimproved cash management by including off-budget accounts in the single treasury account. \nThe Corruption Eradication Commission has effectively prosecuted some very high-ranking \nofficials. Other major public financial management reforms are also under way in Indonesia \n(para 36): these include a medium-term expenditure framework; program and performance \nbudgeting; and modernizing the treasury system, including a financial management information \nsystem.  Other  complementary  measures  include  unification  of  the  planning  and  budgeting \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2007.

Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at the central bank (Bank Indonesia) to receive all loan proceeds. The \naccount will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nF.  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  of  the  Macro  Economy  and  the \nCountercyclical Expenditure Program  \n47.  In cooperation with the Executing Agency (para. 41), during the period specified for the \ncountercyclical  programs,  ADB  will  carry  out  semiannual  reviews  of  macroeconomic \nperformance and implementation of the Government\u2019s countercyclical expenditure program and \nreport to the Board of Directors. The mechanism for the proposed INO-CS loan is based on \ncountry  monitoring  systems  and  civil  society  participation.  The  monitoring  mechanism \ncomprises three parts: (i) an established interministerial committee (and process) for monitoring; \n(ii) use of country public financial management systems for monitoring budget execution of \nprojects and programs supported under the INO-CS loan (Table 3); and (iii) use of civil society \norganizations  and  development  partners\u2019  mechanisms  for  monitoring  selected  projects \nsupported under the loan and an assessment of their development impact.  \n \n48.  The monitoring mechanism (process). The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, \nMOF  and  BAPPENAS  have  established  a  coordination  arrangement  for  monitoring \nimplementation of the fiscal stimulus program of the Government. MOF will be the coordinator \nfor macroeconomic performance monitoring through the PESF mechanism (that meets quarterly) \ncomprising key development partners (ADB, AusAID, the Government of Japan, and the World \nBank). BAPPENAS through its Evaluations and Monitoring Directorate, in coordination with the \nrelevant line ministries, will report on implementation of the countercyclical expenditure program. \nADB staff meets with the monitoring committee quarterly and a report to the Board of Directors \nfor the loan will be done on a semiannual basis. MOF will provide budget disbursement data of \nthe spending line ministries. BAPPENAS will provide data on selected project implementation. \n \n49.  Monitoring macroeconomic performance. ADB will review and assess developments \nin the key macroeconomic indicators presented and described in the access criteria matrix in \nAppendix 2, including quarterly fiscal data and budget outturns, public debt ratios, external \nbalance, and monetary survey. In assessing macroeconomic performance, it will draw on the \nMOF  quarterly  reports  provided  under  the  PESF  monitoring  mechanism;  IMF  reports  on \nIndonesia, including its annual Article IV Consultations with the Government and the Selected \nIssues; and any other relevant materials. ADB staff will also draw on the results of the economic \ncrisis  monitoring  survey  that  will  be  carried  out  by  the  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  in \ncollaboration with BAPPENAS, the World Bank and funded by AusAID. 12 Finally, ADB staff will \nalso draw on the results of the broader dialogue over, and monitoring and evaluation of, reforms \nunder the DPSP series. \n \n                                                 \n12 The crisis monitoring survey was carried out in August 2009, and will be carried out again in November 2009 and \nFebruary 2010. The survey will comprise 12,000 households nationwide. The survey will collect information from \nhousehold heads on income, expenditure, access to public services and social assistance programs.  \n ", "                           21\n    \n50.  Monitoring  the  Government\u2019s  countercyclical  expenditure  program.  ADB  will \nmonitor and review the program in three respects. First, at the macro level it will monitor \naggregate budget outturns for the countercyclical expenditure program and disbursement rates \nof the key agencies, collected by MOF through its monthly budget outturn reports. Second, it will \nmonitor implementation of selected programs and projects supported by the INO-CSF loan and \nidentified in Table 3. These include investments in the social sector (such as low cost housing \nfor families remote fishing villages, and students) and competitiveness enhancing investments \nin the agriculture sector and downstream traditional distribution sector (such as farm to market \nroads, traditional wet and dry urban markets and SME support), among other investments, \nCollection  of  budget  disbursement  data  and  project  accomplishments  including  additional \nemployment generated under the projects will be coordinated through the Evaluations and \nMonitoring Directorate at BAPPENAS. BAPPENAS collects implementation data on a monthly \nbasis from all relevant line ministries using a standard template. BAPPENAS will provide ADB \nwith monthly fiscal stimulus monitoring reports13 on implementation of projects and programs \nunder the fiscal stimulus package, including the number of jobs created under the programs. \nThird, ADB in collaboration with BAPPENAS will report on the development impact of selected \nprograms and projects identified in Table 3 (such as the construction of traditional markets, rural \nfeeder roads, construction of low cost housing for the poor). This will be done through carrying \nout participatory audits and field surveys in 2010 of selected infrastructure projects supported by \nthe INO-CS loan at the end of the facility period (December 2010). This will also promote \nindependent quality control of selected infrastructure projects. The model for the participatory \naudit will draw on the proposed Philippines road sector institutional development and investment \nprogram  currently  under  processing  and  expected  to  be  submitted  to  the  Board  for \nconsideration in December 2009. The participatory audits and surveys will be jointly undertaken \nby BAPPENAS and civil society organizations engaged in the relevant sector to assess the \nwelfare and development impact of selected projects. The audits and surveys will be financed \nunder ADB technical assistance under preparation. \n \n51.  For the infrastructure projects under PNPM monitoring of its implementation will be \ncoordinated using mechanisms established under the PNPM and supported by previous ADB \nand World Bank programs. Mechanisms under the PNPM have established strict protocols for \nreporting and monitoring disbursements, engagement of civil society groups and community \nfacilitators. For the social assistance programs such as BOS monitoring of its implementation \nwill be coordinated using country mechanisms established under the BOS.    \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n52.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$500,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for Countercyclical Support from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 200 basis points; a term of 5 years, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n22 September 2009 \n                                                 \n13 The monthly reports are titled BAPPENAS.

Adverse Impact of    The Indonesian economy has been adversely affected by the global economic crisis in several ways. \nthe Global Economic  Government finances have been more vulnerable to the deteriorating external market conditions \nCrisis  because of the country\u2019s large gross financing needs and its reliance on international capital markets \nto finance its budget. The economy has also been under pressure from a sharp decline in trade flows \nand investment growth. Although the economy is still resilient, growth has weakened significantly. \nWith the external environment continuing to deteriorate, economic growth is projected to weaken \nfurther to a level significantly lower than that needed to continue the current pace of poverty reduction. \nWithout  strong  domestic  efforts  and  fiscal  stimulus,  poverty  incidence  is  projected  to  increase \nsignificantly. \n  Economic growth  Although domestic consumption remained robust, partly because of the fiscal stimulus, economic \ngrowth weakened significantly to 4% in Q2 2009 and is projected to weaken further to 3.0%\u20134.0% for \nthe rest of the year. \n  Exports and  Exports in June 2009 contracted by 27% and investment growth also weakened significantly to 3.5% \ninvestment  in Q1 2009 from 13.7% in the same period last year.    \n  Remittances  Remittances declined by 15% from $1.3 billion in Q4 2008 to $1.1 billion in Q2 2009. \n  Fiscal deficit  To accommodate the fiscal stimulus, the Government increased the budget deficit from 1.0% to 2.5% \nof GDP in the revised budget approved by the Parliament in July 2009. \n  Tax revenue  Tax revenue has softened considerably because of weakening growth, declining trade flows, and the \ncollection  tax-related stimulus package. Actual tax revenue for the first 6 months was about 43% of the 2009 \nannual target. \n  Impact on sovereign  Spreads surged on dollar bonds to about 1,100 bps in November 2008 from an average of 320 bps in \nbond spreads  the first 6 months of the year. Spreads have gradually declined since April 2009, but remain higher at \naround 430 bps and more volatile than those of other countries in Southeast Asia.  Spreads on \ndomestic bonds rose to over 650 bps in 2008. \nB. Countercyclical    The Government is implementing a countercyclical program that focuses on (i) supporting consumers\u2019 \nExpenditure Program  purchasing power, (ii) protecting the business sector from the global downturn, and (iii) generating \nemployment to mitigate the impact of job losses in the private sector. \n  Increased  The 2009 budget plans to increase infrastructure spending at all level of governments by 25% in real \ninfrastructure  terms, thanks to the reduction in public spending on subsidies. The stimulus package introduced in \nspending  February 2009 also includes an additional $1 billion spending for infrastructure beyond programmed \ncapital spending approved in the original 2009 budget. Proceeds from the INO-CS loan will support \npart of the Government's infrastructure program such as low cost housing program, enhancing rural \nsector productivity projects, among others (Table 3 page 12).  \nA\n  Social assistance  The Government has scaled up its National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM) for 2009.  p\np\nprograms  Under  lower  growth  scenarios  for  2009,  BAPPENAS  projects  that  poverty-related  spending  will  en\nincrease to about Rp36.3 trillion (Rp26.0 trillion for the existing social protection programs and Rp10.4  dix\ntrillion for the PNPM). The Government has budgeted Rp3.8 trillion for its unconditional cash transfer   2\nprogram for January and February 2009 to mitigate the poverty impact of the global crisis. The \nconditional cash transfer program is still in a pilot stage, covering 720,000 households, and is likely to \nbe scaled up to mitigate the poverty effects of the economic slowdown. The 2009 budget also  2\n7\n ", "   \nCSF Access Criteria  Indicators  ADB Staff Assessment  2\n8\nincreased education spending significantly, which would be threatened by declining tax revenue.   \nC. Sound    The Government has maintained sound macroeconomic management and introduced swift measures \nMacroeconomic  to mitigate the impact of a slowing global economy. This involved taking a number of preemptive  A\np\nManagement  measures aimed at maintaining the stability of the domestic bank system by increasing liquidity,  p\ne\nassuring the confidence of depositors, and strengthening the central bank\u2019s lender of last resort  n\nd\nfacility. The Government also introduced fiscal stimulus measures while easing monetary policy  ix\n 2\nappropriately to respond to weakening growth prospects.   \n  Monetary policy and \nBank Indonesia has responded prudently throughout the crisis. Inflationary pressure was a concern \ninflation \nprior to the crisis. To arrest emergent inflationary pressure, Bank Indonesia progressively increased \nits policy rate to 9.5% in October 2008. As inflationary pressure waned with the fall in global \ncommodity prices and economic growth prospects weakened rapidly, Bank Indonesia shifted its \npolicy direction and lowered its policy rate to 6.50% by August 2009. Year-on-year inflation declined \nto 2.7% in July. \n  Adjustment policy  The Government has taken a number of proactive measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of \nmeasures to address  further disruption, and maintaining the confidence and stability of the financial system. Key measures \nthe financial crisis  include the following: (i) creation of emergency powers that establish the roles, responsibilities, and \nprocedures that govern the actions and responses of Bank Indonesia, the minister of finance, and the \nDeposit Insurance Corporation in the event of the failure of a financial institution; (ii) the central bank \nstrengthened its lender of last resort facility; (iii) increased coverage of the deposit insurance scheme; \nand (iv) the central bank eased liquidity in the banking sector through monetary expansion. \n  Debt sustainability  Public debt is sustainable. Prudent fiscal policy has enabled Indonesia to reduce its public debt \nanalysis  burden significantly. In the past 5 years, Indonesia\u2019s public debt\u2013GDP ratio has fallen sharply, from \nover 55% in 2004 to around 33% at the end of 2008. The latest debt sustainability analysis suggests \nthat, under the baseline scenario of continued historical growth and low budget deficit, the debt\u2013GDP \nratio will decline to 28.5% in 2014. Under most types of shocks, Indonesia\u2019s debt levels and servicing \nobligations would remain sustainable. Fiscal contingent liabilities amounting to 10% of GDP could \nraise the public sector debt to almost 38% of GDP by 2014. A 30% depreciation of the rupiah would \nraise the debt ratio by 9 percentage points during the same period. Other macroeconomic shocks \nhave more limited impact on the country\u2019s debt sustainability. The fiscal space for the stimulus \npackage is sustainable as the primary balance required to stabilize debt is about 0.3% of GDP. \n  Public financial  The Government has an aggressive PFM reform program supported under the Development Policy \nmanagement  Support Program (DPSP) series and other development partners\u2019 assistance. Key reforms include \nsystems  strengthening the budgetary process, budget transparency, and civil service reforms.  \n  External balance  The external balance position is strong. Gross international reserves at the end of August 2009 were \n$57.9 billion, sufficient for 6.0 months of imports and servicing of official external debt. \nBAPPENAS = National Development Planning Agency, CSF = countercyclical support facility, DPSP = Development Support Program, GDP = gross domestic \nproduct, PFM = public financial management, PNPM = National Community Empowerment Program. \nSource: Bank Indonesia, International Monetary Fund, and Asian Development Bank.\n ", "  Appendix 3  29    \nECONOMIC AND POVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT  \n \nA.  Economic Contraction  \n \n1.  The economy began to slow in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2008 and growth decelerated to \n4% in Q2 2009 on a year-on-year basis, compared to a 6% growth rate in 2008. The slowdown \nin growth was broad-based, with most major economic sectors declining, driven by the export-\noriented manufacturing sector. Depressed external demand for goods and sluggish foreign \ndirect investment inflows were the primary drivers behind the economic deceleration in Q2 2009. \nOn the expenditure side, private consumption growth remained positive in the first semester of \n2009\u2014partly supported by the one-off election spending in Q1 and the tax cuts as part of the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  stimulus  package\u2014but  consumption  began  to  weaken  in  Q2.  Public \nexpenditure was a key engine of growth in the first semester of 2009, growing by 18% over the \nsame period in 2008, up from an average growth rate of 3\u20134% in first semesters of 2006 and \n2007, indicative of the large magnitude of the Government\u2019s spending program in 2009 (Figure \nA3a). \n \n2.  Another way of looking at economic performance is the output gap, which measures the \ndifference between potential output and actual output in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth. A small output gap suggests that the economy is at its long-run trend or full employment. \nIf growth exceeds the potential growth rate (i.e., a positive output gap), it suggests the economy \nrisks overheating associated with above-trend inflation. If actual growth is below potential (i.e., a \nnegative output gap), this suggests an economic downturn usually associated with below-trend \ninflation. Asian Development Bank (ADB) staff estimates indicate that Indonesia\u2019s potential \neconomic growth is 6.0%\u20136.5% per annum. Staff estimates also indicate the emergence of a \nsignificant output gap in 2009, projected at 3\u20134% (in the absence of the fiscal stimulus), similar \nin magnitude to the one that emerged in the late 1980s (Figure A3b). Inflation is subdued, \nindicative of weakening aggregate demand and the fall in commodity prices (Figure A3c).  \n \nB.   Impact of the Government\u2019s Countercyclical Public Spending Program   \n \n3.  Economic  stimulus  effects. In times of a negative output gap, governments  may \nstimulate the economy through a combination of policy instruments such as (i) expansionary \nmonetary policy and therefore lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and consumption, \nand (ii) fiscal expansion through tax cuts and increasing discretionary public spending. An \nappropriate fiscal expansion will depend on its size relative to the output gap and the multiplier \n(or second-round effects) of the different components of the fiscal stimulus. Empirical evidence \nfor  other  countries  indicates  that  infrastructure  spending  has  the  largest  multiplier  effects, \nfollowed  by  cash  transfers  to  poor  families;  tax  breaks  have  the  lowest  multiplier  effects \n(generally less than 1) as some proportion will be saved. \n \n4.  The Government is using both instruments to stimulate the economy. In aggregate, the \nnational government budget deficit is projected at 2.5% of GDP or an expansion of 2.4% over \n2008 (budget deficit of 0.1% in 2008). Overall, the fiscal stimulus component (incremental \nrevenue and spending measures) amounts to about 1.4% of GDP to support domestic demand. \nWith multiplier effects, the stimulus could add 1.5\u20131.6% to GDP. Of the stimulus package about \nhalf  stems  from  lower  income  taxation  and  other  tax  exemptions  and  the  rest  from  other \nexpenditure items, mainly new and/or advanced infrastructure projects. The tax cuts comprise a \npermanent  increase  in  the  taxable  income  threshold  to  Rp15.8  million  and  a  reduction  in \npersonal and corporate income tax rates. These tax cuts amount to Rp43 trillion. Other tax cuts \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \ninclude a temporary reduction in VAT and custom duties on selected products estimated at \nRp13 trillion.   \n  \nFigure A3: Output Gap and Fiscal Response \n   (a) Growth in GDP by Major Expenditure    (b) Potential and Actual Economic Growth 1980\u20132009 \n  Categories (first semester, % change year-on-year)            \n30 9\n7\n20\n5\n10\nth 3\nw\no 0\n%gr--2100 consumptioPublic ConsumptioPrivate Investment Exports Imports --131198119831985198719891991199319951997199920012003200520072009\nn n\n-30 -5\n2007 2008 2009 Actual Growth Potential growth\n   \n \n(c) Inflation rate (% change year-on-year)    (d) GDP Growth With and Without Fiscal Stimulus        \n14.0 7\n12.0 6\n10.0 5\ne8.0 wth4\n% rat6.0  gro3\n%\n2\n4.0\n1\n2.0\n0\n0.0\nJ M M J S N J M M J 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\nan-08 ar-08 ay-08 ul-08 ep-08 ov-08 an-09 ar-09 ay-09 ul-09 Growth with stimulus Growth w/o stimulus\n    \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nNotes: Indonesia's potential economic growth rate is estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, which estimates a \nnonlinear trend in the economic growth data.

ADB staff estimates that without the fiscal stimulus, economic growth could bottom at \nabout 2.0%\u20133.0% in 2009 and recover to about 4.7% in 2010 in line with a modest global \neconomic recovery.

This is just under about half of the negative output \ngap that would emerge without the fiscal stimulus. The fiscal response from the 2009 budget is \nexpected to carry over into early 2010 at a much smaller magnitude, perhaps in the order of \n0.3% of GDP (Figure A3 d).  \n \n6.  Poverty impacts. The economic slow down in the order of GDP by 3.0%\u20134.0% in 2009 \nwill reduce per capita incomes growth to 1.5\u20132.5% in 2009. This could increase poverty in the \nshort run through a weak labor market and reduced household earnings. Over the medium term, \na slow economic recovery will create persistently high unemployment and suppressed earnings \nin the informal sector as new labor market entrants outstrip new jobs created. This in turn will \nlead to persistently higher poverty. The Government's fiscal stimulus through quick disbursing \nand labor intensive projects will partially offset the unemployment and poverty impacts of the \ncrisis. However, employment\u2013GDP elasticity indicates that an economic recovery of 6\u20137% in \n2011 is necessary to ensure a sustained reversal in deterioration of the labor market (Table A3).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nTable A3: Poverty Impact Assessment Matrix  3\n2\n \nSupport for the Government's countercyclical fiscal stimulus program. The global economic crisis is likely to hurt the poor in the short and medium term through \nthree channels. The first channel is the weak labor market as hiring activity across most sectors has slowed with loss of jobs in the export sector and shift to \nA\ninformal labor markets in 2009. The second channel is through lower household incomes with lower consumer spending. The third channel is through poor families  p\np\nreduced access to social services such as education, health and sanitation. This may also increase the poverty incidence rate in the medium term. The  e\nn\nGovernment's countercyclical fiscal stimulus program (CFSP) is designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis on the poor by creating employment and mitigating  d\nix\nthe impact of job losses through the labor intensive infrastructure construction policy, increased spending in the social sectors and scaling up key social assistance   3\nprograms.

This is expected to increase poverty in the short run through a weak labor market and reduced household earnings. Over the medium term, a slow \neconomic recovery will lead to persistently high unemployment and lower earnings in the informal sector as new labor market entrants outstrip new jobs created.  \nThis in turn will lead to higher poverty. Structural poverty may persist as poor families' access to social services is reduced. The Government's fiscal stimulus will \npartially offset the unemployment and poverty impacts of the crisis however, an economic recovery in the order of 6 percent in 2011 is necessary to ensure a \nsustained reduction in unemployment and poverty. The increased coverage of social assistance program will have an immediate impact on welfare of families and \nin reducing longer term poverty by supporting access to employment, maintaining access to education for poor households and ensuring access to targeted cash \ntransfers. \n \nTime dimensions: The increased spending in social assistance programs will have an immediate positive effect on the poor.

Public Debt \n \n1.  Public sector debt has declined as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) since \n2000.1 The ratio fell to a post-crisis record-low level of 33% in 2008 (Figure A4.1) owing to \nprudent fiscal management, which led to fiscal surpluses averaging almost 2% of GDP per year \nin the last decade. Reduced risk premiums, lower interest rates, and high real GDP growth also \ncontributed to debt consolidation. Foreign-currency debt (mostly to multilateral institutions) has \nfallen markedly to about half of total debt, as the improved fiscal position facilitated government \naccess to the domestic capital market.  \n \n2.  In  the  baseline  scenario,  a  moderate  further decline in public sector  debt  is  likely. \nDespite a larger fiscal deficit, public debt is projected to fall to about 31% of GDP in 2009, \nreflecting rupiah appreciation and falling interest rates. In the medium term, the public debt\u2013\nGDP ratio is expected to decline gradually to 28.5% by 2014. Strong growth from 2011 and \nsustained fiscal prudence drive this result. A return to positive primary balances from 2011 is \nconsistent with accommodating extra resources for development spending. \n \n3.  Standard stress tests suggest that the projected decline in the debt ratio could be \nvulnerable to contingent liabilities, sharp exchange rate movements, and higher interest rates \n(Figure A4.1). Fiscal contingent liabilities amounting to 10% of GDP could raise the public sector \ndebt to almost 38% of GDP by 2014, with the ratio above 40% in 2010 (a level not seen since \n2005). A 30% currency depreciation would raise the debt ratio by 9 percentage points compared \nto the baseline. A large increase in real interest rates would have smaller, but still sizeable, \neffects, with the debt ratio reaching 33% by 2014. Other macroeconomic shocks have a more \nlimited impact.  \n \nB.  External Debt \n \n4.  Indonesia\u2019s external debt has also declined steadily since the crisis, from over 150% of \nGDP in 1998 to 29% in 2008 (Figure A4.2). External debt as a percentage of exports has also \ndeclined, from 288% to 97%, over the same period. \n \n5.  In the baseline scenario, the external debt dynamics are projected to be sustainable. \nThe debt\u2013GDP ratio is projected to decline to around 22% by 2014. The main driving factors are \n(i) the projected increase in real GDP growth to 5%\u22126% over the medium term; (ii) a projected \npositive  growth-interest  rate  differential;  and  (iii) an  expected  increase  in  non-debt-creating \ncapital inflows. The favorable trend in external debt may be reversed if these expected positive \ndevelopments do not occur. \n \n6.  The external debt ratio is most vulnerable to shocks to the exchange rate. A one-time \n30% real exchange rate depreciation would raise the debt ratio by 14 percentage points in 2010, \nwith the impact falling to 12 percentage points over the baseline by 2014. \n                                                 \n1  Extracted with permission from International Monetary Fund. 2009.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) has five basic strategies for poverty reduction: (i) broadening \nopportunities,  (ii)  empowering  community  institutions,  (iii)  increasing  capacity,  (iv)  providing  social  protection,  and \n(v) promoting global partnerships. The NPRS is to be implemented through macroeconomic strategy and policies for fulfilling \nbasic rights, promoting gender justice and equality, and regional development. It considers macroeconomic policies as the \nfoundation for reducing poverty through a supportive business environment and broad opportunities for increasing the \ncapability of the poor through four related objectives: (i) create macroeconomic stability, (ii) promote economic growth, \n(iii) increase  opportunities  for  employment  and  entrepreneurship,  and  (iv)  reduce  inequalities  between  regions.  The \nGovernment\u2019s medium-term national development plan (RPJM) includes the main tenets of the previous draft NPRS and \nincorporates the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This provides an overarching framework that places human \ndevelopment and poverty reduction at the center of the development agenda. \n \nThe country poverty assessmenta and country poverty partnership agreementb consider macroeconomic stability as a \nfundamental underpinning to poverty reduction. The poverty agreement also calls for expanding and improving such key basic \nservices as health, education, water supply, and sanitation through public\u2013private partnerships; and points out the need to \nexpand the system of social protection. The Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF) provides support to government measures \naimed at mitigating the impact of the global financial crisis and keeping the country on track to meet MDG targets. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nThe current global financial crisis is expected to lead to reduced economic growth, retrenchments, move to informal sectors, \nand decreased real wages and living standards for a significant portion of the population. The economy is slowing down in \n2009, with growth projections ranging from 3.0% to 4%. Exports in June declined by 27% on a year-on-year basis, suggesting \nthat the lower end of projections is an increasingly likely outcome for 2009. ADB staff estimates that without the fiscal \nstimulus, poverty could rise by 3 to 4 million person or 1 to 2 percentage points of the population.  \n \n2. Design Features  \n \nIndonesia Countercyclical Support (INO-CS) supports government efforts to mitigate the effects of the crisis by supporting a \nstimulus package, cash transfer programs for the poor, and maintaining critical spending on social sectors and infrastructure. \n \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nThe recent fall in inflation and thus food prices has benefited the poor, which spend a larger proportion of their budget on food \nthan the average household. The poverty rate declined to 14.2% in early 2009 from 14.4% in early 2008, showing the effects \nof the good rice harvest, stability in food and fuel prices, and the impact of the unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program to \nthe poor and near poor that was implemented in 2008\u20132009. The country defines poverty based on a consumption bundle \nthat consists of food items (to satisfy 2,100 calories) and basic non-food items determined by the pattern of consumption of \nreference households near the poverty line. As in most developing economies, poverty is mostly a rural phenomenon in \nIndonesia.  \n \nThe unemployment rate decreased to 8.14% in February 2009 from 8.46% in February 2008.However, stress in the labor \nmarket is showing up in a surge in people entering the informal sector in 2009, with new hire in the formal sector declining to \n400.000 from about 1.8 million in 2008. Public services also remain inadequate in Indonesia from a middle-income country \nstandard. High malnutrition and maternal mortality rates, inadequate access to safe water and sanitation, and poor education \noutcomes are other dimensions of poverty. Access to rural infrastructure is also limited. Inequality has increased over time \n ", "                       Appendix 6  43\n      \nand disparities between regions remain high, with regional pockets of relatively higher poverty in East Indonesia, Papua, and \nLampung.   \n \nEconomic growth, with rapid formal employment creation and stable prices, remain the most important anti-poverty drivers in \nIndonesia. The CSF supports the Government\u2019s fiscal stimulus package, aimed at mitigating the impact of the crisis\u2014\nparticularly on poor and vulnerable groups\u2014as well as measures aimed at reducing poverty. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nAccording to data from the 2008 National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS), the Government\u2019s UCT program maintained \nthe welfare levels of 60% of household UCT recipients and assisted 30% of recipient households to escape from poverty. The \npolicy actions under the CSF support the Government to maintain progress achieved under the UCT and other poverty \nalleviation and social protection programs. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nAs part of program preparation, extensive consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, including the private \nsector, civil society groups, and development partners. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. The CSF process supports the Government\u2019s C&P process.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nThe INO-CS has an indirect gender impact through the National Community Empowerment Program and its role in reducing \npoverty and unemployment by supporting an increase in public expenditure to social services. The improved poverty \norientation of public spending increases women\u2019s access to essential services needed for achieving MDG targets, including \nimproving child and maternal health.  \n \n2.

Development Policy Support Program Cluster \n \n1.  The Development Policy Support Program (DPSP)1 supports the development policy \nagenda  of  the  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL)  series  prepared  by  a  joint  team  of  the \nGovernment of Indonesia, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Government of Japan, and the \nWorld  Bank.  The  DPL  is  a  series  of  five  annual,  single-tranche  loans  supporting  the \ndevelopment policy agenda of the Government of Indonesia, as envisioned in the national \nmedium term development plan (RPJM). The cluster aims to help the Government achieve its \nmedium-term  growth  and  poverty  reduction  objectives  through  four  core  policy  areas: \n(i) macroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness  through  continued  monitoring  of \nmacroeconomic indicators; (ii) improving the investment climate through regulatory reforms, tax \nand  customs  reforms,  and  strengthening  financial  sector  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises\u2019  (SMEs\u2019)  access  to  finance;  (iii)  improving  public  financial  management  and \ngovernance  by  strengthening  budgeting,  controls,  transparency  and  procurement,  and  civil \nservice reform; and (iv) improving delivery of public services to the poor through pro-poor \ntargeting of public programs and strengthening community-driven development.  \n \n2.  Support for the RPJM through parallel cofinancing of the DPSP series is a key pillar of \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program 2006\u20132009.2 Under the country strategy and program, a \ndual-track approach is adopted to ensure that the high-level macroeconomic and governance \nreforms  supported  through  the  policy  dialogue  of  the  DPSP  series  complement,  and  are \nreinforced by, ADB\u2019s sector programs. The approach involves structuring ADB support through \n(i) participation in the DPSP to strengthen the macroeconomic and fiscal framework while \naddressing crosscutting concerns; and (ii) sector-specific policy interventions in the areas of \ninfrastructure,  financial  deepening,  local  government  finance,  and  poverty  reduction  and \naccelerated progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). ADB\u2019s dual-track \napproach aims to harmonize and align development partner strategies with Indonesia\u2019s country \nstrategy and priorities. Moreover, development partner harmonization around the Government\u2019s \nown programs has bolstered country ownership of the reform process.  \n \n3.  Key  features.  At  its  inception  in  2004,  the  DPL  series  was  designed  to  support \nIndonesia\u2019s  transition  from  postcrisis  stabilization  to  more  long-term  development.  It  was \nexpected to provide the foundation for continued, medium-term policy engagement in the areas \nof  macroeconomic  stability,  the  investment  climate,  and  public  financial  management  and \nanticorruption. It also provided for a flexible means of taking into account the pace and direction \nof the reforms. Hence, as the program has evolved, the scope of the reform agenda has \nbecome broader. The broadening of the agenda has also been accompanied by deepening of \nreforms, whereby successive DPL and PSP operations have built on previous ones to ensure \nincremental  implementation.  The  theme  of  the  DPL-1  was  on  restoring  and  maintaining \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  consolidating  macroeconomic  achievements  at  a  time  when \nIndonesia was leaving its postcrisis International Monetary Fund program. In this context, the \nfocus was on macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, the investment climate, and public \nfinancial management and governance. The theme of the DPL-2/DPSP-1 progressed toward \ncreating fiscal space. This led to themes more focused on implementation. The emphasis of the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "46   Appendix 7 \nDPL-3/DPSP-2 was on utilizing the fiscal space that had been created in the DPL-2 to have a \ngreater impact on service delivery, while the theme of the DPL-4/DPSP-3 carried this further \nforward by deepening the process of institutional reform. Reflecting the flexibility of the program \nand  the  Government\u2019s  success  in  achieving  macroeconomic  stability  and  attaining \nmacroeconomic triggers ahead of time, the Government and development partners agreed in \nearly 2006 to remove the macroeconomic pillar for the DPL-4/DPSP-3, but to continue the policy \ndialogue on macroeconomic stability. At the same time, the increased fiscal space generated by \nreduction in fuel subsidies, declining debt service payments, and increasing revenues had \nopened up opportunities for a greater focus on public service delivery as a new policy area. \n \n4.  Accomplishments. Policy actions under the macroeconomic pillar relating to debt and \nfiscal  policy  management  contributed  considerably  to  lower  levels  of  debt  to  GDP  and  a \nconsiderable increase in non-oil tax revenues. Rating agencies have also cited debt reduction \nand  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms,  including  changes  to  the  investment  law, \ncustoms and tax reforms, and fiscal reforms\u2014all activities supported by the DPL/DPSP\u2014as the \nreason for recent sovereign rating upgrades. Policy actions supported under the investment \nclimate have led to significant improvements in business start-up times, value-added tax (VAT) \nrefund  times,  and  the  establishment  of  a  sounder  and  sustainable  financial  safety  net. \nDPL/DPSP  policy  measures  have  also  supported  revisions  to  the  Tax  Law  in  2008,  the \nimplementing decree relating to tax audit procedures, implementation decrees supporting the \ninvestment law, and the rollout of a national single window with online clearance of merchandise. \nA key achievement under the public financial management pillar has been the implementation of \nthe Treasury Single Account to improve cash management of public finances. The DPL/DPSP \nhas helped move forward reforms to reengineer business processes across the budget cycle.  \n \n5.  The  national  budget  is  now  compatible  with  the  international  standard  government \nfinance  statistics  classification.  Fiscal  reporting  is  more  comprehensive  and  timely,  and \nelements of a medium-term expenditure framework have been introduced, although they are not \nfully operational in the budget system. Initial steps to address civil service reform have also \nbeen  launched.  As  an  initial  measure,  the  DPL/DPSP  supported  the  development  of  a \ncomprehensive  reform  of  the  structure  and  remuneration  framework  for  high-ranking  state \nofficials. A task force was set up to examine the entire compensation package with the goal of \ncreating a more transparent, systematic, and coherent framework for pay and allowances based \non a comprehensive job evaluation and pay grading. Building on this, the Ministry of Finance \nhas developed a comprehensive civil service reform action plan, which is being pilot tested in \nother agencies. Important steps were also established to help lay the groundwork for improving \npoverty targeting of basis services. As the 2005 fuel price hike made available more funds for \nsocial spending, the DPL/DPSP supported building capacity in government institutions to create \na more evaluative institutional framework that would improve the targeting of these released \nfunds.  Lessons  from  targeting  were  incorporated  into  the  new  cash  transfer  program  that \naccompanied the May 2008 fuel price increase. The DPSP/DPL also supported critical actions \nto improve the quality of public service delivery in education and community-based development. \n \nB.  Public Expenditure Support Facility  \n \n6.  The Public Expenditure Support Facility (PESF)3 is part of a joint effort of the World \nBank, ADB, Government of Australia, and Government of Japan to support a common crisis-\nmitigating action agenda with the Government of Indonesia, and provide contingent budget \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for Public Expenditure Support Facility Program. Manila (Loan 2521-INO). \n ", "              Appendix 7         47   \nfinancing in the event of further instability in credit markets that may result in a shortfall in \nbudget financing needs. The PESF complements the World Bank\u2019s DPL and ADB\u2019s DPSP \nseries, which reflect the Government of Indonesia\u2019s commitment to reforms over the medium \nterm. \n \n7.  Under the PESF, the Government will implement a series of confidence-boosting policy \nmeasures aimed at sending a strong positive signal to the markets, making it more likely that \nIndonesia will meet its commercial market borrowing targets for 2009. These policy measures \naddress the increased short-term vulnerabilities and risks to the Indonesian economy from the \nglobal financial crisis and sharp slowdown in the global economy, and underpin the key priorities \nof the Government\u2019s reform agenda. These measures include actions to (i) reassure financial \nmarkets and maintain financial system stability, (ii) sustain critical public expenditures while \nmaintaining budget discipline to mitigate the poverty impacts of the growth slowdown, and \n(iii) crowd in private investment and support exports.  \n \n8.  Key features of the PESF include (i) a single tranche loan with scheduled and multiple \nwithdrawals;  (ii)  a  small  number  of  high-impact  policy  measures  designed  to  address  the \nadverse impacts of the ongoing financial crisis completed prior to consideration by ADB\u2019s Board \nof Directors; (iii) a financing plan for the Government\u2019s projected gross financing needs for 2009, \nincluding  projected  commercial  borrowings  in  the  domestic  and  international  markets;  and \n(iv) withdrawals  of  the  loan  amount  to  be  made  when  the  drawdown  triggers  set  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s financing plan are met and the policy measures introduced under the Program \ncontinue to remain in place. In this way, the PESF program mirrors features of the World Bank\u2019s \nPESF parallel cofinancing loan of a development policy loan with a deferred drawdown option \nwhereby subsequent withdrawals of the single tranche loan are contingent on the drawdown \ntriggers set out in the financing plan being met. Under the best case scenario, where the \nGovernment meets all of its financing targets from market sources, in which the global financial \nconditions do not deteriorate substantially, and approval of the PESF sends a strong positive \nmarket signal, no withdrawal would be expected under the PESF. Under a second scenario, in \nwhich the market condition remains tight and the drawdown triggers set out in the financing plan \nare met, the Government can exercise its options to access the PESF funds. Under a third \nscenario,  in  which  there  is  a  sharp  deterioration  in  the  global  financial  market  creating \nmacroeconomic  instability  and/or  a  balance-of-payments  crisis,  the  PESF  is  unlikely  to  be \neffective and Indonesia will need crisis mitigation support. \n \n9.  The Government has indicated that its first preference is to use its access to domestic \nand/or  international  markets  to  meet  its  financing  targets.  The  financing  plan  incorporates \nquarterly  targets  for  rupiah  and  US  dollar  bond  issuances.  Under  the  financing  plan,  the \nGovernment has projected financing requirements from the market of $12.5 billion equivalent for \n2009. However, in the event of tight market conditions, the Government and development \npartners  have  established  broad  parameters  on  the  basis  of  which  the  Government  may \nwithdraw the $5.5 billion funds available from the PESF to meet its quarterly financing shortfall \nduring  the  program  period.  The  Government  and  development  partners  will  assess  the \nGovernment\u2019s financing shortfall every quarter and determine if disbursement from the PESF is \nrequired.  \n \n10.  In  line  with  the  financing  plan,  the  Government  and  development  partners  have \ncommitted to the principles that the loan would be used only in the following circumstances: \n \n(i)  Sound  macroeconomic  framework.  The  overall  macroeconomic  situation \ncontinues to be sound and the policy program on track. However, given the \n ", "48   Appendix 7 \nglobal financing crisis and the importance of the Government\u2019s financing plan, \nthe development partners and the Government have decided that a review of the \nGovernment\u2019s macroeconomic policy framework and its progress in carrying out \nthe PESF (including its financing plan) will be undertaken on a quarterly basis in \naccordance with the jointly agreed governance arrangements. \n(ii)  Limited market access. Indonesia has limited market access because of global \nand/or domestic liquidity constraints, so it needs access to the facility to maintain \npublic spending and/or requires additional fiscal stimulus. The withdrawals will be \nlinked to Indonesia\u2019s access to market finance, where access will be assessed \nfrom a set of objective criteria.    \n(iii)  Phased withdrawals. Withdrawals from the PESF are phased as needed. The \nfull  amount  of  the  loan  is  unlikely  to  be  required  at  once.  Therefore,  the \nGovernment has articulated a schedule of withdrawals in line with its financing \nplan. It is expected that the loan will be withdrawn each quarter after the joint \ngovernment  and  development  partner  review  meeting,  with  a  cap  on  the \nmaximum amount that can be drawn down each quarter.  \n(iv)  Proportionate disbursement from development partners. The financing plan \nindicates that if the withdrawal is warranted, the Government will draw down \nsupport from development partners proportional to their commitment. This way, \nthe support and risk would be spread across all the partners participating in the \nPESF.  \n \n11.  The financing plan includes a governance arrangement that allows the Government and \nits development partners, including ADB, to meet in the quarterly meetings or extraordinary \nmeetings  to  (i)  assess  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic  policy  framework,  (ii)  evaluate \nprogress  in  implementation  of  the  financing  plan,  and  (iii)  determine  the  amount  that  the \nGovernment  will  draw  on  support  provided  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  The \nGovernment and any development partner could also request additional meetings to respond to \nevolving economic conditions. In the event that the Government proposes changes to the \nfinancing plan, but the changes do not involve a change to the objective of the financing plan \n(such as changes in the Government\u2019s financing targets or its market access parameters), these \nwill be done on a consensus basis with the Government and other development partners. The \nrevisions to the parameters will be guided by, but not limited to, the following considerations: \n(i) inflation rate, (ii) increased cost of bonds with longer maturities, (iii) bond maturities structure \nand volume consistent with past practice and prudent debt management, and (iv) possible \ncrowding effects on the private sector. \n \n \n ", "                       Appendix 8  49\n      \nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n1.

This  appendix  summarizes  the  determinants  of  the  size  and  composition  of  fiscal \nstimulus packages and draws on the findings a number of recent International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) cross-country studies.1 Two sets of factors help explain the relative size of stimulus \npackages: (i) differences across countries in the need for stimulus, and (ii) differences in fiscal \nspace. \n \n2.  Need  for  stimulus.  The  magnitude  of  the  overall  fiscal  expansion  (including  both \ndiscretionary and nondiscretionary components) should depend on the size of the output gap \nthat each country faces in the absence of fiscal support. The fiscal expansion in a particular \ncountry should also be larger if multipliers are lower.   \n \n3.  Composition of stimulus. Fiscal stimulus packages are typically comprised of (i) tax-\nrelated measures, (ii) social sector spending, and (iii) infrastructure expenditures. However, the \nweight given to any one of these components depends on preexisting fiscal characteristics. \nCountries in which the automatic stabilizers are smaller (e.g., those that have less extensive \nsocial benefits programs) will require greater discretionary stimulus\u2014this is true of most of the \ncountries  in  Asia  in  relation  to  developed  economies.  Tax  stimulus  measures  can  be \nimplemented relatively quickly and their impact is already being felt in the fiscal accounts. \nExpenditure measures, however, tend to proceed more slowly, reflecting normal budgetary \ncontrols and typical start-up delays in new programs. Multipliers, however, tend to be higher for \nexpenditure-related stimulus measures than for tax-related ones. A recent IMF paper suggests \nthat in a global recession fiscal multipliers for an individual economy will be higher if other \ncountries operate fiscal stimulus programs through spillovers to imports, than if an individual \ncountry operates a fiscal expansion in isolation.2 The fiscal multipliers are larger if monetary \npolicy is also accommodative.  \n \n4.  Differences in fiscal space. Key factors that determine a country\u2019s fiscal space to \nexpand include levels of deficits, public debt, contingent liabilities, and interest rates. Countries \nfacing relatively higher real interest rates or elevated debt levels have less room to expand; \ncompeting crisis-related needs, such as that for financial sector support (mainly in the US and \nEurope), are also factors in determining available fiscal space. \n \n5.  Increasing  fiscal  space.  The  available  fiscal  space  can  be  increased  through \nappropriate policy design. Ideally, a larger fiscal expansion in times of economic crisis can be \naccommodated if policy design increases the likelihood of a fiscal tightening once conditions \nimprove, to ensure long-term fiscal solvency. In this respect, the IMF has offered a number of \nrecommendations: \n \n(i)  Stimulus packages should not have permanent effects on deficits. Table A9.1 \nprovides  a  cross-country  comparison  of  stimulus  packages  in  terms  of  the \npermanent or temporary nature of their fiscal impact. \n(ii)  Medium-term fiscal frameworks should clarify the Government\u2019s commitment to \nfiscal correction once economic conditions improve. \n                                                 \n1  IMF. 2009.

Debt stabilizing primary budget balances. The necessary effort for each country to \nstabilize  its  level  of  debt  and  ensure  long-run  fiscal  sustainability  will  depend  on  its  own \ncircumstances.3 In this respect, emerging economies in Southeast Asia may be more favorably \nplaced than most advanced economies as they have lower initial debt positions, and are less \nsubject to fiscal challenges brought about by aging populations. Table A9.2 provides a cross-\ncountry comparison of debt positions and the debt-stabilizing primary balance needed to bring \ndebt down to threshold levels commensurate with maintaining market confidence as estimated \nby the IMF.4 As can be seen from Table A9.2, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, and Malaysia only require primary budget balances in the range of 0.3%\u20131.1% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) to stabilize debt.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  The debt\u2013gross domestic product (GDP) ratio evolves according to the identity: \u0394 (D/Y), = (r-g/1+g)(D/Y) -pb, \nt-1\nwhere D is the debt stock, Y is GDP, r is the nominal interest rate, g is the nominal growth rate, pb is the primary \nfiscal balance as a share of GDP, and \u0394 indicates a change over the previous year. The debt ratio is constant when \npb = (D/Y)(r-g)/(1+g). \n4  The threshold may be higher for some countries such as the US. \n ", " \nTable A9.1: Composition of Fiscal Stimulus Packages  5\n2\n    Major     \n  Selected SERD economies  emerging  Major developed economies \nA\n  economies  p\np\nItem  INO  PHI  VIE  MAL  SIN  THA  IND  PRC  CAN  FRA  GER  ITA  JAP  UK  US  e\nn\nd\nExpenditure  ix\n 9\nInfrastructure   \nT  T  T  T      T  T  T  T  T    T  S  T \ninvestment \nSupport to \n    T  T    T          T    T     \nSME/farmers \nSafety nets \nT  T  T  T  T  T    T  T  T  T  T  T  T  T \n \nHousing/ construction \nT    T  T        T  T  T  T    T  T   \nsupport \nStrategic industries \n    T  T      T  T  T    T         \nsupport \nIncrease in public \n  T  T  P                       \nwages \nOther \nT  T    T  T    T  T  T  T  T    T  T  T \n \nRevenue \nCorporate income tax/ \nP  P  T  T  P  T      P  P      P    P \ndepreciation/incentives \nPersonal income tax/ \nP  P    T  T  P      P    P    P  P  P \nexemptions/deductions \nIndirect tax \nT    T  T    P  T  P    T  P      S   \nreductions/exemptions \nOther \n        T                P  P   \n \nCAN = Canada, FRA = France, GER =  Germany, IND = India, INO = Indonesia, ITA = Italy, JAP = Japan, MAL = Malaysia, P = permanent measures (with \nrecurrent fiscal costs), PHI = Philippines, PRC = People's Republic of China, S = self-reversing measures (costs are recouped by compensatory measures in \nfuture years), S: self-reversing measures (costs are recouped by compensatory measures in future years), SERD = Southeast Asia Department, SIN = Singapore, \nT = temporary measures (with explicit sunset provisions or time-bound spending), THA = Thailand, UK = United Kingdom, US = United States, VIE = Viet Nam. \nSource: Country Authorities, Asian Development Bank, International Monetary Fund. \n ", "  Appendix 9  53 \nTable A9.2: Debt and Primary Balance \n(% of GDP) \n \n  Pre-crisis WEO projections     Current WEO projections \nDebt-stabilizing \n  Debt  PB    Debt  PB \nPB or PB needed \n   \nto bring debt to \n  2009  2012  2009  2012  2009  2014  2009  2014  benchmark levela \nItem \nCanada  61.0  51.3  1.2  0.5    75.6  65.4  (3.5)  (0.4)  1.0 \nFrance  63.0  60.5  (0.3)  0.8    77.4  95.5  (5.3)  (2.1)  3.1 \nGermany  61.1  59.4  2.1  2.0    79.8  91.4  (2.3)  1.9  2.8 \nItaly  104.1  102.0  2.5  2.6    117.3  132.2  (0.9)  0.5  5.8 \nJapan  194.2  189.6  (1.8)  (0.2)    217.4  239.2  (9.0)  (5.1)  9.8 \nUnited Kingdom  42.9  42.5  (0.5)  0.2    68.6  99.7  (10.0)  (3.8)  3.4 \nUnited States  63.4  65.8  (0.8)  (0.3)    88.8  112.0  (12.3)  0.3  4.3 \nChina, People's  13.4  11.2  (0.4)  (0.6)    20.9  21.3  (3.8)  (0.4)  0.2 \nRepublic of  \nIndia  69.8  61.5  0.2  0.5    83.7  73.4  (4.1)  0.7  2.8 \nIndonesia  32.8  27.7  0.1  0.6    31.1  28.4  (0.5)  0.2  0.3 \nMalaysia  40.7  35.8  (1.1)  (1.6)    39.0  50.0  (3.3)  (5.2)  1.1 \nPhilippines  45.1  42.7  2.2  1.9    52.1  45.1  1.2  3.1  0.7 \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, PB = primary budget balance. \na Average primary balance needed to stabilize debt at end-2014 level if the respective debt-to-GDP ratio is less than 60 \npercent for advanced economies or 40 percent for emerging market economies (no shading); or to bring debt ratio to 60 \npercent (halve for Japan and reduce to 40 percent for emerging market economies) in 2029 (shaded entries).
