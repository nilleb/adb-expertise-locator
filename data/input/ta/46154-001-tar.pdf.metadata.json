INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 commits the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nexpanding  operations  in  education,  with  a  focus  on  post-basic  education,  technical  and \nvocational education and training, and higher education. The objective is to promote human \ncapital  development  and  the  acquisition  of the  skills  demanded  by the  market to  improve \nemployment  prospects  for  the  labor  forces  of  developing  member  countries  (DMCs),  and \nincrease resilience to economic shocks.1 This commitment is especially relevant to the Pacific, \nwhere human capacity development that enables productive, sustainable employment remains \na  significant  challenge.  The  Pacific  Approach,  2010\u20132014,  which  acts  as  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for the 10 smaller Pacific DMCs, highlights the particular need to involve \nwomen and youth in the development process to enable them to participate in the benefits of \ngrowth through increased employment and greater economic empowerment.2  \n \n2.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) aims to improve labor market outcomes in the \nPacific, including for women and youth, by supporting deeper analysis and understanding of \nlabor markets, sharing knowledge on approaches that improve labor market performance, and \npromoting more collaborative approaches to developing and implementing labor market policies \nand programs. The TA complements ongoing economic policy TA,3 and seeks to strengthen \nlabor market links to infrastructure and education sector operations in the Pacific. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Pacific  labor  markets  are  generally  performing  poorly.  While  there  is  considerable \ndiversity  among  the  14  Pacific  DMCs,  there  are  examples  across  the  region  where \nunemployment and underemployment are both high, with a large proportion of the labor force \nengaged in subsistence activities; women\u2019s labor force participation is low; youth unemployment \nis high relative to other age groups; and the number of formal private sector jobs is limited. If \nthese current challenging labor market conditions persist and recent population trends continue, \nthe number of unemployed and underemployed people in the Pacific is likely to rise sharply in \ncoming decades. Given the size of the regional labor force is expected to increase by about 45% \nto 9.6 million people by 2030, to avoid further increases in unemployment, nearly 1 million new \nformal sector jobs (an increase of 44% over current levels) need to be generated. This does not \ninclude  providing  formal  jobs  for  a  further  830,000  workers  who  will  otherwise  join  the \nsubsistence economy.5 \n \n4.  Poor  labor  market  outcomes  result  from  the  interaction  of  many  factors.  Skills \nmismatches can lead to a gap between the supply of skilled workers and industry demand. \nInappropriate labor market regulation may limit the demand for labor by constraining private \nsector development. Large informal sectors in many Pacific DMCs result in low levels of labor \nproductivity; while higher levels of public sector employment may crowd out private sector \nemployment. Gender stereotyping and other forms of discrimination may limit the participation of \nwomen  and  youth  in  labor markets.  A growing  number  of  young  people  have  inadequate \nfoundational capabilities, so are unable to find productive employment. Fragile situations in \nmany Pacific DMCs compound the labor market challenge. In these countries, weak institutions, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Pacific Economic Monitor, July 2014 for analysis and data on Pacific labor markets.  \n ", "2   \ninsufficient  capacity,  and  social  tension  may  undermine  effective  policy  and  program \nimplementation.  \n \n5.  There is a substantial body of ongoing and recently completed analysis on labor market \nissues in the Pacific. Information gaps will be assessed on a country-by-country basis. For \nexample, in the case of Fiji, the TA will build on analytical work being undertaken by the \nEconomics and Research Department.6 In two other Pacific DMCs, which will be selected during \nTA implementation, analytical work supported by the TA will be used to synthesize existing \nknowledge and data, and identify gaps. Key issues in labor market policy will be identified and \nsupported  through  the  preparation  of  action  plans  and  establishment  of  multi-stakeholder \npartnerships.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be that national development plans for Pacific DMCs systematically \nincorporate policies and programs to improve labor market performance. The outcome will be \nthat labor market policies and programs in participating Pacific DMCs are more evidence-based, \ncollaboratively determined, and gender-focused.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will have the following outputs: \n \n8.  Output 1: Development of regional knowledge sharing and analysis platform on \nPacific labor markets. A regional conference, planned to be held in Fiji, will launch the TA as a \nplatform for knowledge sharing on labor market performance in Pacific DMCs, and promoting \ngreater  dialogue  between  public  and  private  stakeholders  on  labor  market  policies  and \nprograms. In consultation with a cross-section of countries, regional organizations, and donors, \nfive or six priority labor market themes will be identified, around which TA activities will be \nsupported and the conference organized. The themes will have broad relevance across Pacific \nDMCs, but given the wide variety of labor market challenges, not all themes will be relevant for \nall countries. Preparatory discussions and meetings will take place to ensure the conference is \nresponsive to country- and region-specific concerns and questions. During the conference, \ndiscussions will be facilitated to enable Pacific DMCs to review available evidence, highlight \ngood practice, identify gaps, and plan follow-on activities. Initial analysis under output 2 will \nprovide contextual analysis for discussion at the conference. Conference proceedings will be \nprepared and disseminated, including online.   \n \n9.  Output 2: Analysis of labor market performance in selected Pacific developing \nmember  countries.  To  strengthen  the  link  between  (i)  evidence-based  analysis  on  labor \nmarkets, and (ii) policies and programs to improve labor market outcomes, the TA will build on \nthe broad body of knowledge to which ADB and other development partners have already \ncontributed on skills development,7 school-to-work transitions,8 and the links between private \n                                                \n6   ADB.  2011.

At the same time, the TA will test the \nreplication of the Fiji labor market assessment approach in at least two other Pacific DMCs, to \nbe determined during TA implementation in consultation with country stakeholders. Particular \nattention will be given to assessing the barriers to, and options for, increasing labor market \nparticipation of women and young people. Action planning in support of improved labor markets \nfor these countries will also be undertaken.  \n \n10.  Output 3: Development of and support for partnerships to improve labor market \noutcomes. The TA will act as a convenor of stakeholders with an interest in improving Pacific \nlabor  market  outcomes.  The  engagement  of  stakeholders,  such  as  regional  organizations, \ndevelopment partners, government departments, private sector and civil society organizations, \nwill be proactively sought in TA activities. Partnerships will be enacted through joint research, \nsharing of experiences, and policy dialogue. The TA will support at least four country, regional, \nor thematic multi-stakeholder partnerships formed during the regional conference that will define \nand implement action plan activities in support of improved labor market outcomes. An initial \nconsultation meeting will be organized in Manila to bring together regional stakeholders to take \nstock of the current labor market situation in Pacific DMCs and to provide input into planning TA \nactivities. As part of the process of forming labor market partnerships, the TA will facilitate policy \ndialogue between public and private stakeholders to review regional data and analysis, develop \ncapacity for deciding on priority labor market actions for each partnership, and determine how to \ntranslate plans into action. A reference group comprising development partners and regional \norganizations is being formed that will provide a venue to share knowledge, and coordinate and \ndevelop regional partnerships.  \n \n11.  All  TA  outputs  are  designed  to  be  scalable.  If  cofinancing  and/or  other  additional \nfinancing becomes available, additional activities will be programmed to contribute further to \nachievement of the TA project\u2019s outputs, outcome, and impact. For example, TA activities could \nbe expanded to cover more countries, deliver more in-depth thematic studies, and include \nadditional national or regional knowledge-sharing events. Additional countries would be selected \non the basis of interest expressed to participate in the TA and adequate representation of the \ndifferent groups of Pacific DMC economies. \n \n12.  The high vulnerability of many Pacific DMCs to external economic shocks or natural \ndisasters pose a threat to the implementation of TA activities. Successful implementation of TA \nactivities will entail securing sufficient institutional and logistical support from Pacific DMCs \nparticipating in the TA. And stakeholders in participating Pacific DMCs will need to be able to \narticulate,  agree,  and  cooperate  on  addressing  key  challenges  for  improving  labor  market \nperformance. Insufficient capacity and commitment to implement actions agreed through TA-\nsupported  activities  may  threaten  success  of  the  TA.  Continued  effort  to  engage  and \ncommunicate with stakeholders constitutes an important action to minimize these risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V).  \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2013.

Participating DMCs will provide counterpart support in the form of in-kind contributions to \ncover logistical support and the provision of government data and other information. The cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB  through  the  Pacific  Department  will  be  the  executing  agency.  Implementation \nresponsibilities will rest with the Pacific Department in cooperation with the appropriate national \nministries  and  agencies  in  participating  DMCs.  TA  activities  will  commence  only  after \nconfirmation of no-objection is obtained from each participating Pacific DMC. All 14 Pacific \nDMCs will be invited to participate in outputs 1 and 3, and selected Pacific DMCs (Fiji and at \nleast two other Pacific DMCs) will participate in output 2. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 36 months starting in January 2015. The \nTA design is scalable and can accommodate possible cofinancing, as well as additional ADB \nfinancing subject to satisfactory TA performance. Evaluation of the effectiveness of TA activities \nwill take place through formal and informal feedback mechanisms. For the regional conference, \na learning evaluation will be administered. Knowledge products will be expected to meet ADB\u2019s \nestablished quality control standards, including for peer review. Regular informal feedback will \nbe elicited from stakeholders participating in TA activities and reported on through regular \nupdates. Dissemination activities both in-country and through ADB\u2019s communities of practice will \nbe included as part of the TA activities.   \n \n17.  The TA will require an estimated 40 person-months of consulting services (15 person-\nmonths of international and 25 person-months national). ADB will engage a consulting team \nfollowing a fixed-budget method of selection using a simplified technical proposal. In addition, \ntwo individual consultants will be hired\u2014a project coordinator and a research analyst. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nImproving the Performance of Labor Markets in the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact  By 2021:    Assumptions \nNational development  Number of country labor  Country labor market  Political and \nplans for Pacific  market action plans  action plans  institutional \nDMCs systematically  developed and    commitment to improve \nincorporate policies  implemented with support  National development  labor market \nand programs to  from development  plans  performance is \nimprove labor market  partners    sustained \nperformance   (Baseline: none.

An  estimated  total  of  40  person-months  of  consultant  services  (15  months  of \ninternational and 25 months of national consultants) will be required to implement the technical \nassistance (TA) project. The consulting team engaged will produce a defined set of analytical \nproducts and organize and deliver one knowledge-sharing event. In addition, a full-time TA \nproject coordinator will be hired for an initial period of 12 months to assist in managing the \nimplementation of TA activities, and to undertake defined analytical tasks; and a part-time \nresearch analyst will be hired for 6 months under an output-based contract to conduct case \nstudies on Pacific labor markets. \n \n2.  Multi-disciplinary  team  (international,  15  person-months;  and  national,  7  person-\nmonths, intermittent). A team of economists and other specialists, with expertise in undertaking \napplied analytical work on labor markets, especially in the Pacific, will be required to design and \noversee the delivery and evaluation of one conference on regional labor markets. The team will \nalso prepare a country labor market action plan for Fiji and at least two country labor market \nperformance assessments for other Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) that will be \nproposed by the team based on their skills and experience and ensuring representative nature \nof issues. Both the action plan and the assessment will be based on analysis of available data, \nstudies, and reports, backed up by in-depth country consultations with government, private \nsector representatives, civil society organizations involved in delivering skills development and \nother  employment-related  services,  and  other  development  partners.  Given  the  gender \ndisparities in the Pacific, the team will ensure adequate representation by women in the analysis \nand consultations.  \n \n3.  International consultants are expected to have 5 or more years of experience, and \npreferably a master\u2019s degree in an appropriate discipline. National consultants are expected to \nhave 5 or more years of experience, and preferably a master\u2019s degree in economics or a related \ndiscipline. Given the nature of the TA, proposals from academic institutions and think-tanks \nwould be especially welcome. To promote greater regional cooperation, joint-venture proposals \nthat include team members from more than one institution will receive greater weight during the \nselection process. \n \n4.   The multi-disciplinary team will undertake the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Prepare a country labor market action plan for Fiji building on ongoing analysis \nbeing supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other available \nanalysis.  Based  on  the  available  analysis,  the  plan  will  identify  a  range  of \npossible  actions  for  discussion,  consultation,  and  agreement  with  key \nstakeholders that are designed to reduce or remove key labor market constraints. \nIn consultation with stakeholders, the consultant will determine and collaborate \nwith  stakeholders  to  implement  activities  to  address  identified  labor  market \nconstraints.  \n(ii)  Conduct at least two detailed country labor market performance assessments in \nagreed Pacific DMCs, including  \n ", "  Appendix 3  9 \n(a)  labor market structure\u2014formal and informal employment, labor force by \nage and gender, major sectors and geographic location of employment, \nmain  occupations  and  related  skills,  and  patterns  of  migration  and \nremittances; \n(b)  skills  development\u2014technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \nsystems  including  education  and  training  service  providers,  courses, \nnumber of students, and level of skills;  \n(c)  private  and  public  sector  demand  for  skills\u2014major  employers  and \npurpose of business; current, short-term, and longer-term profile of skills \nneeds; and human resource planning;  \n(d)  policy,  institutional,  and  legal  arrangements  on  employment\u2014laws  on \nminimum  wage,  employment  protection,  labor  organization;  and \nresponsible institutions;  \n(e)  review  of  data  sources\u2014census,  household  income  and  expenditure \nsurveys, enterprise surveys, and ad hoc employment assessments; and \n(f)  challenges to the participation of women and youth in the labor market.  \n \n(iii)  Disseminate the labor market assessments through in-country workshops and \nseminars, including the outline of a draft labor market action plan for review by \nkey stakeholders to identify possible policies and programs to improve labor \nmarket outcomes.  \n(iv)  Review and synthesize data and recent analytical and knowledge products on \nlabor market-related issues in the Pacific. \n(v)  Based  on  initial  consultations  with  regional  stakeholders  and  ADB,  develop \nspecific analytical case studies on labor market performance in selected Pacific \nDMCs  \n(vi)  Coordinate with ADB staff and the project coordinator to provide regular updates \nof progress, highlighting any significant implementation challenges. \n(vii)  In consultation with ADB, design, organize, and deliver a regional conference to \npresent  and  discuss  the  draft  country  assessments  and  action  plans,  and \nshowcase the analytical work on Pacific labor markets of other researchers. \n(viii)  Following  the  conference,  prepare  conference  proceedings,  and  revise  and \nfinalize  the  initial  country  assessment  and  action  plan,  including  an \nimplementation plan for follow-up activities to improve labor market performance \nagreed with government and stakeholders.  \n \n5.
