INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 2005, the Government of Viet Nam began an effort to introduce an electricity market \nto ensure the sustainability of the power sector. The Electricity Regulatory Authority of Vietnam \n(ERAV) under the Ministry of Industry and Trade has been tasked with implementing power \nsector reform and is preparing for the wholesale electricity market, which is expected to be \nlaunched on a pilot basis in 2015. The ERAV requested the support of development partners to \nhelp with the reform process, and particularly requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nsupport building the capacities of the key market players that will play critical roles in the \nwholesale electricity market, including the five regional distribution companies (known as power \ncorporations) and the National Load Dispatch Center (NLDC).  \n \n2.  Energy  is  one  of  ADB\u2019s  priority  sectors  of  engagement  in  Viet  Nam.  The  country \npartnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015 indicates that energy sector operations will focus \non reform and market development to meet electricity demand with reliable, environmentally \nsustainable supply.1 The government\u2019s request is consistent with ADB\u2019s priorities and, based on \nthe government\u2019s demonstrated commitment to reform, ADB will provide assistance through this \ncapacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA).  The  TA  was  designed  through  detailed \ndiscussions with the Ministry of Industry and Trade and ERAV by ADB team members stationed \nin the Viet Nam Resident Mission, and through extensive development partner coordination. \nThe government and ERAV concur with the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The power sector in Viet Nam is characterized by (i) the dominance of state-owned \nenergy enterprises, with Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) being the major national power utility; (ii) an \naverage electricity retail tariff of D1,500 per kilowatt-hour, which is lower than the long-run \nmarginal  cost  estimated  to  be  in  the  range  of  D1,700\u2013D1,900  per  kilowatt-hour;  (iii)  vast \ninvestment needs to satisfy anticipated electricity demand growth of more than 10% per annum \nfor the next decade; and (iv) the weak financial position of EVN. The government does not \ndirectly subsidize EVN but supports it indirectly, e.g., through provision of fuel at submarket \nprices and low-interest loans. To ensure the sustainability of the sector, the government enacted \nthe  Electricity  Law  in  2005  and  embarked  on  power  sector  reform  starting  with  the \nestablishment of the ERAV as the regulator. In 2006, a road map to establish the electricity \nmarket was approved, which stipulates the market\u2019s gradual development in three phases: (i) \nestablishment of the Viet Nam competitive generation market (VCGM) from 2012; (ii) pilot test of \nthe Viet Nam wholesale electricity market (VWEM) from 2015, with full implementation from \n2019; and (iii) establishment of a competitive retail market from 2021 (Supplementary Appendix \nA).3 The objectives of the reform include   \n \n(i)  developing a competitive electricity market in a phased and sustainable manner, \n(ii)  attracting new investors to the power sector, \n(iii)  reducing the state\u2019s investment and subsidies in the power sector, \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2012.

Ha Noi.  \n ", "2   \n(iv)  improving the efficiency of the power sector and ensuring a stable and reliable \nsupply of electricity, and \n(v)  reducing the pressure of increasing electricity tariff.4 \n \n4.  The government has demonstrated a strong commitment to implement the reform by \nrestructuring EVN from a vertically integrated utility into a holding company, establishing the \nElectric Power Trading Company as the single buyer and NLDC, both of which are currently  \n100% owned by EVN. Subsequently, the transmission function was unbundled as the National \nPower Transmission Corporation in 2008, and five power corporations were established in 2010 \n(Supplementary Appendix B).5 \n \n5.  Phase 1 of the road map (establishment of the VCGM) was launched in July 2012 with \nthe  unbundling  of  EVN\u2019s  generation  function  into  three  power  generation  corporations.6 \nCurrently, 102 power plants participate in the VCGM, which is designed as a mandatory cost-\nbased pool market with day-ahead bidding.7 Monitoring and assessment of the VCGM have \nconcluded that it has been operating largely according to the market rules.8 However, several \nshortcomings  have  also  been  identified,  which  should  be  addressed  as  the  government \ntransitions to the second phase of the road map (the VWEM). \n \n6.  Based on the conceptual design of the VWEM prepared with the assistance of the World \nBank in 2012, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement has recently mobilized consultants to \ndevelop the detailed design of the VWEM. Further assistance is expected from the United \nStates Department of State and the World Bank to monitor and improve the VCGM and to \nestablish the market rules and the legal and regulatory frameworks of the VWEM.  \n \n7.  Despite these efforts to develop the VWEM, little attention has been paid to helping the \nmarket players effectively participate in the proposed VWEM. In particular, the new roles of the \npower corporations and the NLDC will change, and their functions will be critical for the effective \nimplementation of the VWEM. The power corporations currently purchase electricity from EVN \nat assigned transfer prices called bulk supply tariffs before selling the electricity to end users at \nnationally regulated retail tariffs that are assessed to be below the cost of supply. In the VWEM, \nthe power corporations will initially purchase up to 5% of their electricity on the spot market, \nwhile the remainder will be purchased at bulk supply tariffs. The volume purchased at bulk \nsupply tariffs will gradually be reduced to zero, and the power corporations will only either \npurchase electricity on the spot market or in competition with other wholesalers through power \npurchase agreements that they will conclude with the power plants. A new fund is expected to \nbe established under VWEM to protect the power corporations from shocks related to market \nprice spikes, since they are not able to pass on any price increase to customers until phase 3 of \nthe  roadmap  (establishment  of  a  competitive  retail  market).  Under  the  VWEM,  the  power \ncorporations  will  also  become  network  service  providers,  and  to  ensure  open  and \nnondiscriminatory access to the distribution network by all network users, their distribution and \nretail functions need to be separated. \n \n                                                \n4 This is the language used in Prime Minister Decision 26/2006/QD-TTg (footnote 3). Introducing market principles \nmay result in tariff increases, because the current regulated retail tariff level is assessed to be lower than the long-\nrun marginal cost of supply. Such adjustments may be necessary to attain the other objectives of the reform. \n5 The five power corporations are Hanoi Power Corporation, Ho Chi Minh City Power Corporation, Northern Power \nCorporation, Central Power Corporation, and Southern Power Corporation. \n6  Pilot VCGM started in July 2011. \n7 A day-ahead market is a forward market in which prices are calculated for the next operating day. \n8 World Bank. 2012. Assessment of Full Vietnam Competitive Generation Market Outcomes. Ha Noi. \n ", "  3 \n8.  The NLDC will be transformed into the system and market operator (SMO). On top of the \nsystem operation function, it will need to further manage the market under the VWEM, including \noperating the sales and purchase of electricity, facilitating market settlements, and reconciling \nenergy accounts and monetary accounts. Furthermore, based on the assessment made by the \nWorld Bank, the NLDC needs to build its capacity in load forecast, day-ahead and hour-ahead \nscheduling, and calculation of water value for the hydropower plants, which is the basis of the \nbid price of the hydropower plants (footnote 8). The reliability and transparency of the SMO is \ncritical to boost confidence to attract new investors into the market. \n \n9.  The TA focuses on building the capacity of key market participants as well as that of \nother  market  participants,  including  power  generation  corporations,  the  National  Power \nTransmission Corporation, the Electric Power Trading Company, and new market entrants such \nas renewable energy developers and potential wholesalers. Since one of the main objectives of \nthe reform is to attract private investment to the power sector and gradually reduce the state\u2019s \ninvolvement,  new  entrants  should  understand  the  mechanism  and  build  the  necessary \nconfidence to participate in the VWEM. \n \n10.  ADB was instrumental in launching the reform through the provision of six TA projects \nduring 1995\u20132009 that contributed to the promulgation of the Electricity Law.9 ADB is also \nimplementing  the  Electricity  Transmission  Pricing  Review  in  the  Context  of  Power  Sector \nRestructuring in Viet Nam, which reviews the transmission wheeling charges payable to the \nNational Power Transmission Corporation.10 The government\u2019s strong commitment to introducing \nthe electricity market and improving the performance of the sector has been confirmed through \nsuch engagements, and ADB recognizes the imminent need to support the ERAV in the process.  \n \n11.  Past experiences show that development partner coordination is critical to effectively \nsupport sector reform and to spur agreement on the direction of the reform. This TA was \nformulated in close coordination with Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, the United States \nDepartment of State, and the World Bank. ADB has also dispatched two resident advisors under \nthe  Capacity  Building  of  Renewable  Energy  Development  Project to support  the  ERAV  in \nmaking informed decisions on the design and implementation of the VWEM, and to coordinate \nthe activities of the development partners.11 \n \nIII.

The TA will have two outputs: (i) increased capacity and knowledge of relevant power \nagencies to operationalize effective wholesale electricity market mechanisms, and (ii) power \ncorporations and the SMO effectively participate in the VWEM. \n \n14.  Key activities associated with output 1 are \n(i)  a basic training workshop on generic wholesale electricity market mechanisms \ntargeting all VWEM participants, \n(ii)  a basic training workshop on the proposed detailed design of the VWEM to all its \nparticipants once the detailed design is drafted, and \n(iii)  exchange of information and experience with the governments of Indonesia and \nthe  Philippines  where  ADB  expects  to  provide  TA  to  support  power  sector \nreforms. \n \n15.  Key activities associated with output 2 are as follows: \n(i)  An  advanced  training  workshop  to  strengthen  the  understanding  of  power \ncorporations and the NLDC on the functions of distribution companies and SMOs \nin a generic wholesale electricity market. \n(ii)  An  overseas  study  tour  to  an  ADB  member  with  a  functioning  wholesale \nelectricity  market  (e.g.,  the  Philippines,  Singapore).  Participants  will  be  from \npower corporations, the NLDC, and the ERAV, and they will be expected to \npresent findings and recommendations at a subsequent workshop. \n(iii)  An advanced training workshop on the proposed detailed design of the VWEM \nfor  the  power  corporations  and  NLDC  on  how  their  roles  and  functions  will \nchange under the VWEM.  \n(iv)  An  assessment  of  the  detailed  design  of  the  VWEM,  and  the  provision  of \nrecommendations for the power corporations and NLDC on modifications to their \ncharters,  objectives,  business  registrations,  legal  status,  functions,  business \nmodels,  financing,  budgeting,  staffing,  information  and  communication \ntechnology  hardware  and  software  requirements,  retrenchment,  training \nrequirements, etc. In particular, the information and communication technology \nrequirements include the following: \n(a)  For  NLDC,  purchasing  of  a  software  license  and  arranging  software \ntraining for dispatch scheduling and calculation of water value needed to \nset bid prices of hydropower plants in the electricity market. \n(b)  For the power corporations, upgrade requirements for supervisory control \nand  data  acquisition  systems,  energy  management  systems,  demand \nmanagement  systems,  metering  systems,  and  software  and  tools  for \nmanaging operation of distribution networks.  \n(v)  Preparation of action plans and cost estimates to implement the recommended \nsolutions. \n(vi)  Monitoring  and  assistance  to  support  the  power  corporations  and  NLDC \nimplement the recommended actions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $780,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, office supplies, secretarial \nassistance,  access  to  relevant  information  and  data,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The \n ", "  5 \nproceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017. The executing \nagency is the ERAV, which will handle policy, legal, and regulatory issues. The implementing \nagencies are (i) the five power corporations (footnote 5); and (ii) the NLDC, which will be \ntransformed into the SMO. A steering committee comprising power sector stakeholders is being \nestablished by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and ERAV to decide on policy matters and, \nwith the support of the resident advisors dispatched by  ADB, coordinate the development \npartners\u2019 activities. \n \n18.  To implement the TA activities, a team of consultants (a consulting firm) will be recruited. \nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using a quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod with a 90:10 ratio on the basis of a simplified technical proposal. It is estimated that 20.0 \nperson-months of international consulting services and 4.0 person-months of national consulting \nservices are required. The consultants will include (i) an electricity market expert and team leader \n(international, 5.5 person-months); (ii) a utility management expert (international, 5.0 person-\nmonths); (iii) a system and market operations expert (international, 3.5 person-months); (iv) a \ncorporate financial management expert (international, 3.0 person-months); (v) an information and \ncommunication expert (international, 3.0 person-months); and (vi) a power sector expert (national; \n4.0 person-months). \n \n19.  In addition, a power sector research assistant (national, 2.0 person-months) will be \nrecruited through individual consultant selection to conduct additional research necessary by \nADB to ensure that the recommendations made by the consulting firm are suitable for Viet \nNam\u2019s power sector. 12  \n \n20.  Good  practices  and  lessons  learned  will  be  disseminated through  the  uploading of \nconsultants\u2019 reports and the TA completion report on the ADB website. They will also be shared \nwith stakeholders in Indonesia and the Philippines, where ADB is expected to support power \nsector reforms.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.
