THE ENSUING PROJECT \n1.  The proposed Advanced Knowledge and Skills for Sustainable Growth Project (AKSI) \naims to support Indonesia\u2019s higher education system in providing advanced skills and knowledge \nto  support  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  project  will  support  upgrading  of  four  public \nuniversities, three in Sumatra and one in Bandung, to provide high quality and demand-based \nprograms as part of the first phase support to the longer-term higher education reform strategy.  \nThe project is aligned with the Medium-term Development Plan (RPJM) 2015\u20132019, and Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Country Partnership Strategy (2016\u20132019), which highlight the critical \nrole of vocational and tertiary education in providing the skilled human capital needed to support \nIndonesia\u2019s economic growth.1 The impact of the project will be increased income and productivity \nof the working age population. The proposed outcome is strengthened relevance and quality of \ntargeted higher education institutions (HEIs). The following two outputs are proposed: (i) market \nresponsive programs delivered by selected HEIs in Aceh, Jambi, and Riau deliver; and (ii) \nimproved teacher training provided by the Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). The total \nindicative cost for the project is $223.6 million, with $200 million financed by a loan from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  $23.6  million  financed  by  the  Government  of  Indonesia.  A \ntransaction technical assistance (TA) for $1.0 million is proposed to be attached to the loan to \nsupport implementation of the project.2  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n2.  To design the project, a participatory process involving relevant stakeholders will be \nconducted. Given the proposed scope and scale, a transaction technical assistance (TA) is \nrequired to support the government to timely complete a quality design of project.3 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n3.  Output 1: Scope and coverage of the proposed AKSI finalized. The first output of the \nTA will finalize the scope and coverage of the AKSI, based on a careful review of the current draft \nproposals, the agreed concept, and other relevant project documents. This involves adjusting and \nstrengthening the proposals from the University of Malikussaleh, the University of Riau, the \nUniversity of Jambi and UPI to maximize development impact.  \n \n4.  For output one of AKSI, the TA will support (i) strengthening the industry focus of the \nproposals  including  identifying  changed  curricula  and  applied  research  proposals;  (ii) \nstrengthening  collaboration  arrangements  with  the  other  HEIs  and  industry  and  identifying \npossible  skills  development  to  be  provided  by  other  HEIs;  (iii)  strengthening  the  specific \narrangements  in  each  university  for  developing  into  a  center  of  excellence;  (iv)  further \nstrengthening the quality and readiness of the physical investment proposals to ensure they meet \nall requirements, including gender responsive and inclusive infrastructure development like toilets \nsuitable for female students, and sufficient safety features for female students, among others; (v) \nidentifying required capacity development needs for university staff and other stakeholders; and \n(vi) at the sector level, preparing the approach to developing the 8 to 10-year investment plan.  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

For output two of AKSI, the TA will support (i) aligning the UPI proposal with the long-term \nvocational teacher education strategy by identifying possible models that can be implemented for \nvocational teacher education; (ii) strengthening the analysis of the need for vocational subject \nteachers; (iii) further strengthening the quality of the physical investment proposals to ensure they \nmeet all requirements, including gender responsive and inclusive infrastructure development like \ntoilets suitable for female students, ramps and other disability supporting facilities, sufficient safety \nfeatures for female students, among others; (iv) identifying the capacity development needs for \nUPI staff and other stakeholders; and (v) at the sector level, preparing the approach to further \nfine-tune the vocational teacher education strategy.  \n \n6.  The TA will do the adjustments in a collaborative manner. For the nonphysical part of \nscope finalization, the following activities will contribute to these adjustments: (i) an updated \nsector analysis which includes the current status, enrollment, results, capacity and financing of \nhigher  education  and  skills  development,  policy  directions,  economic  development  policy, \nregional developments and policy of Aceh, Riau and Jambi, and teacher employment, recruitment \nand education, specifically at vocational subject teachers; (ii) an analysis of the local labor market \nsituation based on available data and additional primary data collection of the Aceh, Riau, and \nJambi labor market and collaborative design activities (based on the human centered design \napproach) to identify more demand-oriented interventions; (iii) an analysis of best practices and \nlessons learned of earlier and ongoing interventions in advanced skills development, with a \nspecific focus on identifying successful models for vocational teacher education to be introduced \nin UPI; and (iv) a social, poverty, and gender analysis related to advanced skills development, \ntransition from school to work, and labor market and economic development (especially in the \npriority sectors in Riau, Aceh and Jambi, and for vocational education teachers), to identify \nbarriers and propose interventions.  \n \n7.  For the physical investment part, the TA will assess the feasibility of the proposed \ninvestments, and ensure maximum readiness. The proposed investments in infrastructure and \nequipment will need to stay aligned with the strategic direction of the universities. In addition, the \nTA will assist in finalizing architectural and preliminary designs and costing, support development \nof terms of reference for detailed engineering design, including determination of suitability for \nprocurement advance action, and if applicable supporting advance contracting and management \nof  the  firms  developing  the  detailed  engineering  design  firm,  and  assist  in  finalizing  the \nprocurement plan and the appropriate (master) bidding documents. \n \n8.  During these design activities and consultations, all relevant stakeholders are to be \nincluded: university management, staff and students, local industry, industry associations, and \nvocational subject teachers, among others. While finalizing the scope, the TA is expected to \nassess the feasibility of the proposals and propose mitigating actions in case more capacity would \nbe needed. The TA will ensure that the final scope is one project to be managed by a project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  in  the  Ministry  of  Research  Technology  and  Higher  Education \n(MORTHE), with certain activities delegated to the project implementation units (PIUs) in the four \nuniversities. This development into one proposal involves aligning and merging existing university \nlevel proposals and identifying which activities are to be managed by the PMU and which by the \nPIUs.  This will include allocating roles and responsibilities to PIUs and the PMU. For the PMU, \nthis is expected to include progress reporting, monitoring and evaluation, knowledge management \nand quality assurance, managing external relations and other sector policy issues, backstopping \nfor procurement and other relevant topics, audit, and implementation of the long-term plan \ndevelopment activities including upscaling of the models and experiences developed and gained \nin the local implementation.  \n ", "3 \n \n9.  These activities will lead to the finalized scope of the project. An initial draft scope is \nexpected  to  be  completed  by  January  2018  and  finalized  in  March  2018.  Implementation \narrangement and first results framework with indicators and targets will be part of the draft scope. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Due  diligence  requirements  for  the  proposed  project  component \nconducted.  The  TA  will  conduct  the  following  due  diligence  assessments:  (i)  financial \nmanagement and procurement capacity of the universities and MORTHE; (ii) economic and \nfinancial analysis; (iii) development partner coordination and sector assessment; (iv) social and \nenvironmental safeguards, especially of the infrastructure components; (v) poverty, social and \ngender analysis; and (vi) risk assessment, including recommendations for mitigating actions. This \nphase is expected to be completed by March 2018 and is done concurrently with finalizing the \nscope, as some findings might lead to adjustments in the design. \n \n11.  Output 3: Project implementation arrangements prepared. The TA will prepare the \ncost estimates and financing plan and prepare the project administration manual, including \ndetailed  specific  project  components,  detailed  implementation  arrangement  and  planning \n(including proposed sequencing of consultant recruitment and procurement bidding and awarding \nfor each implementing agency, relevant bidding documents, advance procurement action, if any, \nand  terms  of  reference  for  consultants),  costing,  procurement  and  financial  management \narrangements, procurement plan with suggested level of priority or, if applicable, post review \nbased on executing agency and implementing agency capacity assessment, results framework \nand monitoring and evaluation plan, technical assistance arrangements and terms of reference, \nthe gender action plan and other gender inputs required in the project documentation package, \nand specific details on implementation of environmental and social safeguards framework and \nrisk management plan. The TA is also expected to support the development of the piggybacked \nTA. This final output is expected to be completed by April 2018.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $840,000 equivalent, of which $800,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, provision \nof office space, logistical support, and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. MORTHE will be the executing agency for the TA. A project \npreparation steering committee will be established, including MORTHE, the four universities, the \nMinistry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Planning (BAPPENAS), and the Ministry of \nFinance to guide the strategic direction of the project preparation, including involvement of the \nMinistry  of  Education  in  the  implementation  of  the  project.  A  technical  committee  with \nrepresentatives from MORTHE and the universities will be established to guide technical aspects \nof the design. While the steering committee will meet 2\u20133 times during TA implementation, the \ntechnical committee will meet regularly to guide and monitor progress and ensure effective design \nof the AKSI. The technical committee can invite other stakeholders as required. \n ", "4              \nTable A3.1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  November 2017 \u2013 September 2018 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education \nImplementing agency  ADB Southeast Asia Department, Human and Social Development Division \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual Consultant  19 person-months  $380,000 \nSelection \nQuality-Cost Based  16 person-months  $420,000 \nSelection \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSources: ADB estimates \n \n15.
