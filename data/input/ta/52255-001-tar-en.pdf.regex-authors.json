INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the knowledge-driven \noperational approach of the country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022 of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  by  providing  knowledge  support  for  infrastructure  investment \nplanning,  institutional  strengthening,  and  capacity  building  in  India\u2019s  less-developed   \nnortheastern region.1  The TA meets ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy priorities of inclusive \naccess to infrastructure and social services in low-income states, regional cooperation and \nintegration (RCI), and the priority agendas in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.2  \n \n2.  The  TA  will  provide  knowledge  and  capacity  support  for  state  agencies  in  Assam, \nManipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura, following specific requests by \nthe state governments.3 The TA will also support infrastructure investment planning, institutional \nstrengthening,  and  related  activities  of  the  North  Eastern  Council  (NEC),  the  Ministry  of \nDevelopment of North Eastern Region (MDONER), and other central agencies in these states.4 \nThe TA has been included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for India, 2019\u20132021.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Government of India\u2019s Act East Policy aims to boost the northeastern region\u2019s \neconomic development as one of its key objectives.6 India\u2019s RCI endeavor focuses on the \nregion,  pursuing  RCI  through  forums  such  as  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation, supported by ADB, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical \nand Economic Cooperation. The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation focuses on \npromoting  RCI  through  transport  connectivity,  energy  cooperation,  economic  corridor \ndevelopment, and trade facilitation with the neighboring South Asian countries and the rest of \nIndia, while linking the region with countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. With \nRCI progress, the region is expected to become an economic growth center and driver for South \nAsia and Southeast Asia. \n \n4.  The northeastern region has rich natural resource endowments and high development \npotential through RCI, but the region\u2019s economic growth has not kept pace with that of the rest \nof  India.  Poor  infrastructure  facilities  and  limited  access  have  hindered  its  socioeconomic \ndevelopment.  The  development  of  core  infrastructure\u2014including  energy  and  urban  and \ntransport connectivity within the region, with the rest of India, and with neighboring Bangladesh, \nMyanmar, Nepal, and Bhutan\u2014is critical to promote rapid, inclusive, and sustainable growth \nand to drive regional integration with  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Despite \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2018\u20132022\u2014Accelerating Inclusive Economic Transformation. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 June 2019. \n4  The NEC is a central government agency established as a regional advisory and planning body. The Ministry of \nDevelopment of North Eastern Region (MDONER) is responsible for matters relating to planning, executing, and \nmonitoring development schemes and projects in the northeastern region. \n5  ADB. 2018. Country Operational Business Plan India, 2019\u20132021. Manila. \n6 The Government of India formally enunciated the \u2018Act East Policy\u2019 at the 12th ASEAN-India Summit and 9th East \nAsia Summit, in November 2014, held in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar. \n ", "2 \ncontinuous efforts by the central and state governments, the efficiency of public and private \ninfrastructure investment in the region remains constrained.7 \n \n5.  The  most  critical  constraint  on  the  region\u2019s  rapid  infrastructure  development  is  the \nsevere  lack  of  investment  project  proposals  that  are  ready  for  financing  and  backed  by \ninvestment prioritization strategies and plans at the sector or state level. Project implementation \nis also generally slow, with numerous cases of time and cost overruns. These are associated \nwith  insufficient  human  resources  and  capacity  of  the  state  infrastructure  departments  to \nundertake investment and project planning, project preparation including detailed designs, pre-\nconstruction activities (such as statutory clearances for environment and forestry, and land \nacquisition), and implementation. Moreover, development projects in the northeastern region \nhave more complex procedures between the state and federal governments in terms of project \nappraisal, budgetary process, and fund flow mechanisms, posing additional challenges. \n \n6.  With this backdrop, the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, \nGovernment  of  India  has  requested  ADB  to  help  relevant  states  (para.  2)  strengthen  the \ninstitutional systems and capacities for state-wide infrastructure vision and investment project \nplanning and preparation, by providing TA in response to states\u2019 specific requests received by \nthe DEA. \n \n7.  ADB  approved  several  knowledge  management  TA  projects  for  India  to  provide \nknowledge support for operational relevance. These TA projects have helped to carry out front-\nend  strategic  studies  in  a  large  country  like  India,  with  multiple  government  ministries, \ndepartments, and agencies at the central and state levels. The TA will provide knowledge \nsupport for strategic studies to help achieve the development vision of India\u2019s less-developed \nnortheastern region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: improved project delivery leading to more \nsustainable and inclusive economic growth in the northeastern region. The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: knowledge-driven investment-ready infrastructure projects prepared.8 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Knowledge support for infrastructure planning provided. Key outputs will \nbe enhancing the capacity of state departments and agencies through knowledge support for \nbetter infrastructure planning and project preparation, and developing NEC/MDONER as a \nknowledge resource center to support the above.
