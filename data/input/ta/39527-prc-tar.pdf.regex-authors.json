INTRODUCTION \n1.  According to the 11th Five-Year Plan, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) will prioritize the development of public transportation with mass rapid transit (MRT) as a \nkey  transport  mode  in  mega  cities.  However,  limited  municipal  government  budgets  may \nconstrain the development of MRT projects, which typically require substantial investments. As \na result, the Government of the PRC has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  suggest  appropriate  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP) \nfinancing modalities for financing urban rail-based transportation systems.1 The advisory TA is \nconsistent with the PRC Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008) dated 8 August \n2005, which supports innovative PPPs, especially in the provision of infrastructure. The fact-\nfinding mission that was conducted from 24 to 26 October 2005 reached an understanding with \nthe Government on the TA objectives, scope, financing, implementation arrangements, and \nterms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 Consistent with the \nAgreement Establishing ADB, the Government of the PRC will be requested to confirm that it \nhas no objection to the proposed TA. No activities under the TA will commence and no TA \nconsultant will be contractually engaged by ADB unless and until the Government no-objection \nhas been attained. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Urbanization in the PRC has become an increasingly dominant phenomenon in recent \nyears, with the urban population growing at a faster pace than the total population. It is forecast \nthat the urban population in the PRC will increase from 536.0 million in 2005 to 694.4 million in \n2015, and to 827.0 million in 2025. The percentage of the urban population in the PRC is \nexpected to rise from 40.5% in 2005 to 49.5% in 2015 and 57.2% in 2025. By comparison, the \npercentage of the urban population in the whole of Asia is forecast to be 45.5% in 2015 and \n51.4% in 2025. Currently, three out of the 30 largest urban agglomerations in the world are in \nthe  PRC  and  there  are  23  cities  in  the  PRC  with  populations  over  2  million.3  Though \nurbanization could bring in benefits in terms of increasing economic activity, employment and \nincome  generation,  poor  or  unorganized  urban  management  could  cause  negative \nconsequences stemming from uncontrolled growth, environmental degradation, and inadequate \nsocial, transport, or other public services. Rapid motorization, traffic congestion and pollution \nhave become common in many large cities in the PRC. The Government is therefore promoting \nthe  development  of  public  transportation,  including  urban  rail  systems,  to  relieve  traffic \ncongestion, reduce pollution, and enhance mobility for urban commuters. \n \n3.  Urban rail systems4 are currently operating in Beijing, Changchun, Chongqing, Dalian, \nGuangzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Wuhan, with a total length of 420 \nkilometers (km). Many other large and medium-sized cities consider new or expanded MRT \nsystems  the  backbone  of  their  integrated  transportation  network  plans.  Fifteen  cities  have \nproposed  building  MRT  systems  to  the  State  Council  as  part  of  their  urban  transport \ndevelopment plans.5 These MRT projects will involve the construction of 65 routes totaling 1,700 \nkm in length at a total investment cost of about CNY600 billion over the next decade.  \n                                                 \n1 In this TA paper, the terms \u201cmass rapid transit (MRT)\u201d and \u201curban rail\u201d will be used interchangeably. MRT includes, \nfor the purpose of this TA, light rails, metros, and trams. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 5 August 2005.   \n3 United Nations. 2004. World Urbanization Prospects: The 2003 Revision. New York. \n4 Including metros, light rails, and railways that connect urban and suburban areas. \n5 Out of these 15 cities, seven\u2014Chengdu, Guangzhou, Harbin, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Shenzhen\u2014\nhave already obtained approval from the State Council.  ", "2     \n4.  The preparation of an urban rail project requires multifaceted assessment not only in the \ncontext of overall urban and transport network development, but also in view of competing \nagendas,  which  call  for  systems  that  are  at  once  (i)  technically  efficient,  (ii)  financially \nsustainable,  and  (iii)  socially  fair  and  affordable.  Technically  efficient  systems  tend  to  be \noversized and financially unviable without high fares, which are not deemed socially acceptable. \nLess expensive systems allow for lower fares, but might be technically suboptimal and increase \nthe burden on the government budget. In the past, these conflicting goals have frequently led to \nimplementation delays or selection of systems that, while less expensive, are inappropriate. \nFurthermore, there has been little evidence internationally that MRT projects can generate \nsufficient revenue from fares and other sources to cover both operation and maintenance and \ninvestment costs.6 While public budget funds can be utilized to finance investment in MRT, \nprivate sector participation would allow public budget funds to be used in other priority areas, \nsuch as education and social services, and enhance the operational efficiency of MRT systems. \n \n5.  In the PRC, the development of an urban rail transportation system must be included in \na  city's  urban  transport  development  plan,  which  is  subject  to  review  by  the  National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC),  in  consultation  with  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction,  before  being  submitted  to  the  State  Council  for  approval.  Once  the  urban \ntransport development plan is approved, the municipal government must prepare a feasibility \nstudy of its urban rail project and submit it to NDRC for final approval. NDRC takes into \nconsideration  certain  criteria,  such  as  gross  domestic  product,  fiscal  revenue,  fiscal \nmanagement capability, and the investment track record of the municipality, in reviewing the \nfeasibility study and determining an appropriate type for an urban rail. However, there is no \nmeaningful  overview  of  the  financing  plan.  Once  the  feasibility  study  is  approved,  the \nmunicipality takes full responsibility for mobilizing finances for its project. Existing MRT systems \nin the PRC were financed by municipal government budgets, domestic bank loans, and foreign \nloans, mainly from export credit agencies. However, these traditional sources of financing will be \ninadequate for the massive funds required for the many MRT projects in the pipeline. Municipal \ngovernments are experiencing rising expenditure burdens as a result of the increasing urban \npopulation and higher demand for social services. Their revenues, which come mainly from \nland-use charges, local taxes, and fees, are insufficient to cover these rising expenditures.  \n \n6.  To  relieve  the  extremely  heavy  burden  of  MRT  investments,  the  Beijing  municipal \ngovernment has adopted a PPP modality for the construction of the Beijing No. 4 urban rail \nline.7 Shenzhen municipal government is also considering PPP financing for the expansion of its \nurban rail system. It is thus envisaged that PPP financing will play an important role for MRT \nfinancing  in  the  PRC.  Going  forward,  there  is  a  need  for  guidelines  to  evaluate  different \nfinancing alternatives, including PPP structures. Specific criteria to select concessionaires or \nprivate sector operators are also needed, as is a clear and transparent legal and regulatory \nframework to attract potential investors. Currently projects have to comply with a broad policy \ndocument that sets out general operational and safety requirements for urban rail systems, and \nother relevant laws such as contract law, foreign joint venture law, and urban planning law. \nHowever, neither PPP laws nor concession laws or regulations are in place.  \n                                                 \n6 World Bank. 2002. Cities on the Move: A World Bank Urban Transport Strategy Review. Washington, DC. It is \nestimated that investment for urban rail varies from $10 million to $30 million per km for light rail, to $30 million to \n$100 million per km for full heavy rail metros, the most expensive of which are fully automatic underground \nsystems. Regarding the financial performance of select MRT systems, the revenue to operating cost ratio ranges \nfrom 0.42 in Kolkata, India to 1.84 in Santiago, Chile. \n7 The Beijing municipal government will bear infrastructure investment costs, while a project company owned by \nBeijing Capital Group, Beijing Infrastructure Investment Company, and Hong Kong MTR Corporation will invest in \nrolling stock. \n ", "  3\n7.  While  some  large  municipalities  have  experience  in  structuring  and  operating  MRT \nsystems, many other municipalities will be implementing their first MRT projects. These will \nmost likely be the largest single investments these cities have ever made. Due to a lack of \nexperience  and  guidelines,  these  municipalities  are  struggling  to  come  up  with  financing \nschemes for these complex mega projects. A PPP manual or set of guidelines will thus serve as \na useful tool during the project preparatory phase to assess different PPP modalities, which vary \nin  terms  of  return  and  risk  allocation  mechanisms  as  well  as  operational  and  financing \narrangements. Municipalities will also have to look for alternative revenue sources to fund public \ntransport projects\u2014not only from property or other ancillary services related to MRT projects \nthemselves, but also from expanded tax bases that cover both direct and indirect beneficiaries. \n \n8.  ADB has supported urban transport in the PRC before. Major lessons learned from an \nearlier  ADB  TA  on  Beijing  Urban  Transport  will  be  incorporated  into  the  implementation \narrangement under this TA (para. 14).8 An important lesson from that TA is that it is vital to \ninvolve all relevant agencies in preparing multisectoral plans. In addition, key suggestions for \nplanning MRTs suggested by a study on China Urban Transport Strategy sponsored by ADB \nand the World Bank in 1995 could be applicable in the current context.9 In the past ADB has \nalso provided technical assistance to develop institutional capacity to promote private sector \nparticipation in the PRC. TA projects on build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes in the water-\nsupply sector10 were rated as successful, and helped strengthen institutions dealing with the \nwater supply.11 In the transport sector, ADB provided technical assistance to prepare guidelines \nand build the capacity of government officials to facilitate the application of the BOT modality \ncorporatization, leasing, and securitization mechanisms to highway projects.12 Lessons learned \nfrom previous TA projects have been incorporated into the design of the proposed TA. Such \nlessons include the importance of establishing a steering committee to address inter-agency \ncoordination issues, and the importance of publishing the TA findings in the local language.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will aim to facilitate private sector investments, or PPP financing, for urban rail \nprojects, and as a result contribute to enhancing mobility and reducing traffic congestion and \npollution in urban areas of the PRC. The three pillars in the ADB-sponsored study Connecting \nEast Asia: A New Framework for Infrastructure are (i) inclusive development, (ii) coordination, \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance Completion Report on TA 2212-PRC: Beijing Urban Transport. Manila. The TA \nwas designed in response to a request from the Government to provide a loan to extend line 1 of the Beijing metro \nbut the Government subsequently indicated that it would not request further assistance from ADB to prepare a loan \nproject. \n9 The study includes only limited analysis of financing alternatives because almost all MRT systems operating at that \ntime were financed by public budget funds, while PPP financing was not widely prevailing. \n10 ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n ", "4     \nand (iii) accountability and risk management.13 Taking into account those three pillars, the TA \nwill (i) address the tradeoff between the financial sustainability of an MRT project and the \naffordability to users; (ii) deliver outputs based on consultative processes and coordination, both \nvertically  between  central  and  municipal  governments,  and  horizontally  between  various \nmunicipal  agencies  (such  as  those  covering  urban  management,  inter-modal  transport \nnetworks, and financing); and (iii) enhance transparency and accountability during the decision-\nmaking process through the introduction of a PPP manual, which will clearly delineate return \nand risk allocation mechanisms and the responsibilities of the public and private sector under \neach PPP modality. Lessons learned from previous infrastructure projects implemented under \nADB\u2019s private sector operations highlight the importance of a conducive policy environment and \na well-established regulatory framework to mitigate political and commercial risks.14 Moreover, \nin line with the ADB draft Transport Sector Strategy, the TA will represent ADB assistance at an \nearly  stage  to  build  the  capacity  of  relevant  agencies  to  develop  MRT  systems,  and  will \npotentially lead to the first ADB-financed PPP urban rail project in the PRC.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will cover four key components: (i) summarizing international best practices and \nurban rail project case studies; (ii) modeling concession structures and alternative revenue \nsources,  and  suggesting  revisions  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  to  facilitate  the \napplication of PPP modalities; (iii) creating a PPP manual and organizing seminars and/or \ntraining sessions to apply the manual in practice; and (iv) recommending one or two pilot cities \nfor further ADB financial assistance. \n \n11.   The first component will involve desk reviews of previous studies on PPP modalities and \nalternative revenue sources to finance existing urban rail projects in both the PRC and other \ndeveloped and developing countries.15 In the past, fare-box revenues, development of real \nestate,  and  advertisement  along  MRT  lines  were  the  main  income  drivers  for  cities  with \nsustainable MRT systems, such as Hong Kong, which adopted a property model to enhance its \nfinancial viability. Little attention has been given to exploring how indirect beneficiaries, who \nexperience  intangible  benefits  like  less  traffic  congestion  and  more  efficient  infrastructure \nservices, can share the massive investment costs of MRT. The TA will look beyond project-\nrelated  ancillary  revenues  and  consider  MRT  projects  in  the  broader  context  of  municipal \nfinancing (e.g., collection of taxes and/or fees from direct and indirect beneficiaries or bond \nissuance).  The  TA  will  study  funding  methods  for  public  transport  in  other  countries,  and \nsuggest appropriate forms of alternative revenues, taking into account the existing legal and \nregulatory framework and consultative discussions with relevant agencies in the PRC.  \n \n12.   To develop a PPP manual and/or practical guidelines in the context of the PRC, the TA \nwill  seek  input  from  all  stakeholders,  including  the  central  and  municipal  governments, \nbeneficiaries, investors, operators, suppliers, financiers, and potential users of MRT systems. \nSubsequently, the TA recommendations will be disseminated and the PPP manual explained to \ngovernment officials in training sessions. Lastly, the multidisciplinary consulting team will review \nthe feasibility studies of MRT projects in the pipeline, paying special attention to ridership \nforecasts and the technical, economic, and financial grounds for the proposed projects. Pilot city \nrecommendations will be made based on this review.  \n                                                 \n13 ADB, The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, Japan Bank for International \nCooperation. 2005.

Manila. \n15 Experience indicates that the BOT model may require adjustments to suit MRT projects. For example, reverse-\ntender BOT, whereby bids are evaluated on the basis of the lowest public subsidy required, may be considered. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $500,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will finance $125,000 equivalent in-kind through the provision of office space, office \nequipment, in-city transportation, and counterpart staff, while secretariat and administrative \nsupport will be financed under the TA budget. The detailed cost estimate and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency of the TA, with technical \nsupport from NDRC. NDRC will provide technical advice and suggestions to a consulting team \nto be recruited under the TA, as well as logistical support and coordination with, especially, \nmunicipal governments. MOF will designate an individual to coordinate with the consultant and \nwill  set  up  a  steering  committee  to  supervise  TA  implementation  at  the  policy  level.  It  is \nenvisaged that the steering committee will consist of representatives from MOF, NDRC, the \nMinistry of Construction, and the municipal governments. The committee will discuss the TA \noutputs,  provide  feedback  to  the  consultant,  and  recommend  how  to  implement  the  TA \nrecommendations in practice. MOF will assume the secretariat function of the committee. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented by a consulting firm over a period of 18 months starting in \nMay 2006 and ending in November 2007. The TA will engage 30 person-months of consulting \nservices consisting of 10 person-months of international and 20 person-months of domestic \nconsultants. The areas of expertise include PPP financing, municipal financing, relevant laws \nand regulations, and MRT technical expertise. The TA will involve multidisciplinary and complex \nconsulting activities covering urban rail transport, PPP financing, municipal financing, and legal \nand regulatory aspects, and will require innovative approaches. Therefore, the quality-based \nselection method and full technical proposal will be used in recruiting the consultant. The firm \nwill be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  An inception report and detailed work plan will be submitted within 1 month of the \ncommencement of the TA. The TA deliverables will first be discussed with the working-level \nstaff, and subsequently with the steering committee, before being finalized. It is envisaged that \nthe outputs under component A will be submitted within 4 months, and component B outputs will \nbe submitted within 9 months. The PPP manual and recommendations of the pilot cities under \nthe other two components will be finalized within 15 months of TA start-up. The final PPP \nmanual and other key reports will be prepared in both English and Chinese and distributed to \nrelevant agencies in both central and municipal governments. The seminars and/or training \nsessions will be organized within 3 months of the submission of the final version of the PPP \nmanual. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Application of Public\u2013Private Partnerships \nin Urban Rail-Based Transportation Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign   Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/ Indicators  Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhanced mobility and reduced traffic  Percentage of  Reports from the  \u2022 Urban transport \ncongestion and pollution in cities with  person-trips using  Ministry of  development is \nurban rail-based transportation systems  public transport (as  Construction and  well planned and \nin the People's Republic of China  opposed to all other  municipal  managed.  \n(PRC).  transport modes)  governments.  \u2022 Urban rail-based \n  increased by 5% in    transportation is \ncities with urban rail-   well integrated with \nbased transportation    the entire \nsystems within 5    intermodal \nyears of technical    transport network. \nassistance (TA)     \ncompletion.

Special attention will be given to concession \nstructure; risk and return allocation; the roles of each project participant (government, investor, \noperator,  constructor,  financier,  etc.);  the  initial  capital  funding  structure  and  arrangement; \nrevenue  generation  modalities;  provision  of  subsidies,  tax  concessions,  and/or  revenue \nguarantees; financing obligations of future capital investments and/or expansion; operation and \nmaintenance arrangements; and government policies and regulatory framework. Concession \nstructures  and  alternative  revenue  sources  will  be  designed  (i)  to  enable  a  municipal \ngovernment (or a project) to realize additional revenues or reduce expenditures, (ii) to allow the \nproject to make independent commercial decisions for operation and maintenance and for future \ncapital investments, (iii) to provide incentives to increase ridership directly or indirectly so as to \nimprove overall utilization of the projects, and (iv) to balance the financial and nonfinancial \nburden of the investment between direct and indirect beneficiaries. The TA will consist of the \nfollowing four components.  \n \nA.  International Best Practices and Case Studies  \n2.  Component A will require 3 person-months of consulting services in the areas of PPP \nstructure and urban rail-based transportation, comprising 1 person-month of international and 2 \nperson-months of domestic consultants to carry out the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Summarize international best practices in developing, structuring, and financing \nurban rail projects involving private sector participation or PPP in developed \ncountries.  Present  various  cases,  highlight  the  key  factors  to  mobilize  and \nmaximize the benefits of private sector involvement, and draw any lessons that \nmight be applicable for developing member countries.  \n \n(ii)  Present and analyze the development and implementation of urban rail projects \ninvolving  private  sector  participation  or  PPP  in  large  cities  in  Asia  such  as \nBangkok,  Hong  Kong,  Kuala  Lumpur,  Manila,  and  Singapore.  Compare  with \nthose in developed countries in point (i) above, and present any lessons learned \nfrom the Asian cases. \n \n(iii)  Conduct diagnostic analysis of urban rail projects that have been planned or are \noperating in the PRC with or without private sector participation. Additionally, \nanalyze financing modalities and subsidy policies for such projects. \n \n(iv)  Assess the application of each case in points (i) and (ii) above in the context of \nthe  PRC,  taking  into  account  the  findings  in  point  (iii)  above.

Alternative revenue sources should aim to relieve the fiscal \nburden of municipal governments and enhance the private sector\u2019s role in the \nsector, and will include not only ancillary revenues for specific projects (such as \nincome from property development), but also taxes or fees that could potentially \nbe  collected  from  both  direct  beneficiaries  (e.g.,  users  and  commuters)  and \nindirect beneficiaries (e.g., owners of motor vehicles benefiting from less traffic \ncongestion).1 Taxes and fees might include environmental taxes on the use and \nownership  of  cars  and  taxes  to  be  collected  from  enterprises  in  the \nmunicipalities.2  \n \n(iv)  Recommend how the innovative concession structures and alternative revenue \nsources suggested in point (iii) above could be contractually realized in practice, \ntaking into account legal and institutional frameworks in the PRC. \n \nC.
