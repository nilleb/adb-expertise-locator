With a population of 96.2 million in 2019, \nViet Nam\u2019s access to water supply increased from 65% in 2000 to 95% in 2017.1 In 2020, the \nwater supply system in Viet Nam has a total treated water production capacity of 9.5 million cubic \nmeters per day with piped water supply coverage in urban areas reaching 88%. The improvement \nhas been driven by the government\u2019s sector reforms, which started in 2007 through gradual \nequitization of state-owned water utilities.2 In 2007\u20132009, the government issued key water \nlegislation to transform water from a social commodity to a commercial commodity. Water supply \ntariffs are set on a full cost-recovery basis. Water supply service companies are required to \ncomply with ambitious targets in reducing non-revenue water to 18% by 2020, from an average \nof 30% in 2010. As of January 2020, about 110 private or partly state-owned water supply service \ncompanies were operating across Viet Nam. \n \n2.  Sector challenges. In 2017, the government decided to fully open its provincial water \nservice companies to private sector ownership. However, the ongoing reform faces various \ninstitutional and financial challenges. First, the Ministry of Construction is responsible for policies \nand regulations governing water supply for urban areas and industrial zones, and the provincial \npeople\u2019s committees (PPCs), i.e., the provincial governments, manage service delivery. The \nchallenges are whether (i) such devolution of responsibility is matched with accountability in terms \nof complying with central regulations and standards, and performing obligations to users; and \n(ii) PPCs can effectively fulfill their roles in planning, implementing, managing, and operating \nessential  services,  with  necessary  accountability  mechanisms  in  place.  There  is  limited \ncontractual relationship between water supply service companies and PPCs in many provinces, \ndespite the government\u2019s regulatory guidance. Limited oversight at the central and provincial \nlevels poses the risk of a privatized water supply service company steering its strategic business \ndecisions towards maximizing returns rather than ensuring equitable and affordable public service \ndelivery.  \n \n3.  Second, a privatized water service company faces the following challenges: (i) weak legal \nbasis of operation and therefore low commitment to improve service standards because of the \nabsence of contractual relationships with PPCs, (ii) limited access to financing for long-term \ninvestments because of insufficient creditworthiness, and (iii) slow transformation of operations \nand corporate culture from a state-owned enterprise to that of a fully privatized commercial entity. \nSince water supply tariffs are approved by PPCs, transferring financial obligations from the \ngovernment (public) to the private sector by reducing the government\u2019s ownership can expose \nthe water supply service companies to heightened risk of financial unsustainability. Developing \nequitable and financially sustainable water supply service in Viet Nam through sector reform \nrequires continuous support to provide access to financing and enhance privatized water supply \nservice companies\u2019 creditworthiness and institutional and operational capacity. \n \n4.  Project  identification.  Since  2011,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been \nsupporting Viet Nam\u2019s water sector reform through a $1 billion multitranche financing facility.

Ha Noi.  \n2 Equitization is a term used in Viet Nam since 1992 to refer to the process of transforming a state-owned enterprise \ninto a joint stock company. The government considers equitization as partial privatization. \n ", "2   \nongoing Water Sector Investment Program3 helps selected Vietnamese water supply service \ncompanies improve their service and invest in key infrastructure by providing access to sovereign-\nguaranteed financing. Building on the sovereign program, ADB and the Binh Duong Water \nEnvironment Joint Stock Company (BIWASE) have explored the potential for private sector \n(nonsovereign) financing since 2019.4 ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Regional Department and Private \nSector Operations Department, working as one team, concluded that ADB can tailor its support \nto BIWASE through a combination of nonsovereign corporate loan and technical assistance (TA). \n \n5.  Project rationale. Binh Duong province, where BIWASE operates and which adjoins Ho \nChi Minh City, is one of the fastest developing provinces in Viet Nam. The province has attracted \n$5.7 billion in foreign direct investment since 2016. More than 25 industrial zones and clusters, \nincluding the Vietnam\u2013Singapore Industrial Park, provide jobs to nearly 1.3 million local workers \nand more than 500,000 foreign workers. Provincial water demand increased annually by 16%\u2013\n20% during 2016\u20132019, and BIWASE projects that the provincial water demand will exceed its \nproduction capacity by 2020\u20132021. \n \n6.  Project design. The project will support the expansion by 100,000 cubic meters per day \nof water production capacity of the Tan Hiep Water Treatment Plant in Binh Duong province. The \ncapacity will serve domestic consumption and industrial zones in Ben Cat town, Tan Uyen town, \nand Thu Dau Mot city. The expansion includes additional water intake pumps and 9 kilometers of \nraw water transmission pipes from the Dong Nai River and the downstream distribution network. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n7.  Financial  management  and  business  planning.  BIWASE\u2019s  financial  management \ncapacity is adequate as it successfully implements sovereign loan projects financed by ADB and \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency. However, BIWASE needs to improve further to \ncomplete its transition from state-owned to commercial entity. Improvements include (i) adopting \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards to better communicate with potential domestic and \ninternational investors; and (ii) developing a long-term corporate business strategy and plan to \nadapt to future climate risk and necessity of mobilizing financing from various sources. \n \n8.  Legal framework. Binh Duong PPC and BIWASE agreed on the service areas, and state-\nowned water supply service assets have been transferred. Water supply tariff calculations in Binh \nDuong follow the national government regulations that provide guidance, methods, and an \nequation which provincial governments shall use for appraising and approving tariff levels.5 The \nwater tariff plan for 2018\u20132022 has been approved by the Binh Duong PPC after being appraised \nby the Department of Finance, Department of Construction, and Department of Labor and Social \nAffairs. However, BIWASE and the Binh Duong PPC need to strengthen their legal framework by \n \n3  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing \nFacility  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Water  Sector  Investment  Program. \nManila. https://www.adb.org/projects/41456-013/main. \n4  BIWASE is participating in the program by taking out a sovereign-guaranteed loan of $39.9 million to upgrade its \nwater supply system under Tranche 2 of the Water Sector Investment Program (ADB.

The attached TA complements the project by strengthening BIWASE\u2019s creditworthiness \nand institutional capacity to provide sustainable and affordable water supply services. The TA will \n(i)  provide  capacity  building  on  financial  management  and  climate-resilient  business  and \noperational planning and (ii) enhance the legal foundation of the business and operational \nframework between BIWASE and the Binh Duong PPC. The TA will be administered by ADB. \nBIWASE will closely coordinate with the Binh Duong provincial government. The TA will be \nincluded in the upcoming country operations business plan for Viet Nam.7 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  The  outputs  will  result  in  the  following  outcome:  BIWASE\u2019s  creditworthiness  and \ninstitutional capacity enhanced. The transaction TA will have outputs and activities as outlined in \nTable 1. \n \n11.  Output 1: Binh Duong Water Environment Joint Stock Company\u2019s creditworthiness, \nclimate-resilient water business and operations, and corporate governance enhanced. The \noutput includes (i) training on financial management including financial reporting aligned with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards; (ii) climate- and disaster-resilient operational support \ntraining on asset management, equipment maintenance, and non-revenue water reduction using \nan  enhanced  data  and  information  management  and  decision  support  system;  and \n(iii) preparation and implementation of a business plan including expected capital investment and \nreinvestment requirements in the medium to long term (e.g., 30 years). \n \n12.  Output 2: Binh Duong Water Environment Joint Stock Company\u2019s legal basis of \nbusiness and operations enhanced. The service agreement between BIWASE and the Binh \nDuong PPC will be improved with appropriate key performance indicators based on international \nand Vietnamese best practices.
