INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 1998, the Government of Sri Lanka decided to unbundle the Ceylon Electricity Board \n(CEB)  into  independent  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  companies,  and  also  to \nestablish an energy regulatory commission. This restructuring program was developed under \nADB-funded technical assistance (TA)1 (the phase I TA). To assist in the implementation of the \nrestructuring program, the Government has now requested additional TA (the phase II TA). This \nTA is included in the 2002 Country Assistance Program for Sri Lanka. Fact-finding was carried \nout in October 2001.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The power sector in Sri Lanka struggled through the late 1980s and 1990s to satisfy the \ngrowing demand for electricity and also achieve financial sustainability. During this period it \nbecame apparent that the traditional mode of public sector finance and control of the power \nsector by one large public utility is not the best framework for meeting the current and future \nchallenges in the power sector. \n \n3.  Recognizing the need for power sector reform, the Government published its power \nsector policy in 1998, which called for unbundling the power sector into separate companies for \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution. ADB and the World Bank supported this decision, \nand subsequently ADB approved TA (footnote 1) to advise the Government on the structure, \noperations, and management of the power sector and the entities within the sector. The World \nBank also approved a facility amounting to $500,000 to advise on the legal and regulatory \naspects of restructuring the sector. The two consulting teams commenced work on the same \ndate, and both are completing their work during the second quarter of 2002. \n \n4.  It was evident that the power restructuring process would require resources additional to \nthose approved in phase I of the restructuring. However, in 1998 neither ADB nor the World \nBank were certain of the Government\u2019s ability to move the restructuring process forward, and \naccordingly approved funds sufficient for the preparation stage of the restructuring process. The \npreparatory stage is now being completed, after some delays, and the Government is ready to \nembark on the implementation phase. The implementation phase is crucial to the success of the \nrestructuring and it is appropriate to support the Government\u2019s request to provide international \nexperience to ensure a successful implementation. \n \n5.  In  terms  of  progress  made  under  phase  I,  the  Government,  through  its  Steering \nCommittee for Power Sector Reforms (the steering committee), which consists of top-level \nGovernment officials and representatives of the private sector, approved the new power sector \nstructure on 6 April 2001. The approved unbundling of CEB and LECO calls for establishing (i) \ntwo  hydropower  generation  companies  and  one  thermal  generation  company,  (ii)  one \ntransmission company with two subsidiaries for bulk-power activity (purchase and sales of \nelectricity) and the transmission activity, and (iii) four distribution companies. An independent \nregulatory commission will be established to regulate the new power sector structure. The \napproved future power sector structure is in accordance with ADB\u2019s energy sector policy, and is \nappropriate for the local environment of Sri Lanka. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance for Preparing the Power Sector Restructuring Project. Manila \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 2001. ", "2 \n6.  The draft reports covering the overall structure as well as specific areas of the power \nsector have been produced by the legal and operational consulting teams. These reports which \nincorporate options on major issues, have been submitted to the Government, through the \nsteering committee, for its evaluation and decision making. This approach ensures that the \ndecisions arrived at will (i) create a Sri Lankan solution to the issues, (ii) increase the ownership \nof the decision, and (iii) assure that restructuring will be implemented. The ADB consulting team \nhas produced the following detailed reports: the engineering report, the personnel report, the \nfinancial report including the tariff report, and the draft implementation report. The finance and \nthe  draft  implementation  reports  are  being  reviewed  by  the  steering  committee\u2019s \nsubcommittees, and they are both scheduled to be considered by the steering committee during \nthe second quarter of 2002. \n \n7.  The steering committee is currently focused on the draft electricity legislation, which was \nscheduled  for  presentation  to  the  Cabinet  in  November  2001.  However,  the  call  for \nParliamentary elections on 5 December 2001 delayed the consideration of the new legislation \nuntil  after  the  elections,  and  the  legislation  was  submitted  to  the  Cabinet  in  March  2002. \nFollowing the deliberation by the Cabinet, the new electricity act will be presented to Parliament \nfor its consideration. \n \n8.  The World Bank has been supporting the legal and regulatory aspects of the power \nsector reforms through grant funds, with the focus on the new electricity legislation. The current \nWorld Bank-funded program is divided into two phases. Phase 1 has covered the development \nof the new electricity legislation, and phase 2 will cover the establishment of the regulatory \ncommission. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The  TA  will  support  the  actual  physical  unbundling  of  CEB\u2019s  vertically  integrated \noperations into separate Government-owned entities, each incorporated under the Companies' \nAct, and help establish and develop the three generation companies, the transmission company \nand the four distribution companies. The TA's objective will be considered achieved when these \nnew companies and the regulatory commission have been established and are functioning in \naccordance with sound commercial business practices. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The design stage (phase I) of the restructuring is scheduled to be completed by June \n2002. After enactment of the new legislation, the regulatory commission is to be established and \nthe commissioners appointed. Before that date, CEB's financial position should have been \nrestored through collection of public sector receivables, elimination of unmetered supply points, \nand replacement of faulty meters. \n \n11.  In phase II, the Steering Committee, through its reform office and subcommittees, will \noversee the work of a series of specialist groups and functional teams that report to them. Two \nfull-time staff are required to manage the day-to-day operational process: a legal manager, who \nwill be responsible largely for the effective establishment of the regulatory commission, its legal \nfoundation,  and  its  procedures;  and  an  implementation  manager,  supporting  the  steering \ncommittee and the boards of CEB and LECO, and ensuring the timeliness and success of ", "    3 \nimplementation.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  to  support  the  legal  and  implementation \nmanagers. \n \n12.  The implementation stage (phase II) will commence prior to the end of the design stage, \nas  a  transition  period  is  required  to  ensure  a  smooth  commencement  of  the  detailed \nimplementation.  In terms of ADB-funded consultants, phase I has fully utilized its allocation as \nof first quarter of 2002, and consultants are needed under phase II to maintain the momentum \nof the restructuring process and prepare for the detailed implementation tasks. The Government \nwill  be  assisted  by  international  and  local  consultants  and  focus  on  six  interrelated  work \npackages. The first is to provide advisory and project planning and management support to the \nsteering committee. Other work packages are designed to (i) provide specialist support to the \nteams  establishing  the  new  companies;  (ii)  provide  customer  and  financial  management \nsystems to ensure prompt collections and efficient management of financial resources; (iii) \ndesign and promulgate sound and effective governance procedures for directors, managers, \nand  civil  servants;  (iv)  develop  and  assist  the  introduction  of  detailed  private  sector  style \norganization  structures,  recruitment  procedures,  and  remuneration  practices;  (v)  implement \ninvestigations to identify and ensure proper allocation of assets and liabilities among the new \ncompanies, to identify material risks and appropriate risk management actions, and to advise on \nappropriate  capital  structures  and  working  finance;  and  (vi)  design  technical  operational \nparameters, and procurement procedures as required for each new company. \n \n13.  Detailed planning and implementation of activities is to be the responsibility of dedicated \nteams of suitably qualified people drawn from CEB, LECO, and other institutions as deemed \nappropriate. The exact number of teams will be determined following the deliberations of the \nsteering committee concerning the detailed implementation plan and the inception report of the \nconsultants. The company teams and functional working groups will focus on specific areas like \nfinance,  tariffs,  and  financial  management  information  systems  (FMIS);  human  resources; \ngovernance; contracts and procurement; customer services; and future electricity supply. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The estimated total cost of the TA is $1.025 million equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange cost is $695,000 and the local currency cost is $330,000 equivalent. ADB will finance \n$800,000, which will cover the foreign exchange costs and $105,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency costs. The budget also provides for workshops for the officials and stakeholders of the \nnew companies, and for travel costs for a Government observer to participate in the contract \nnegotiations in Manila. The Government will contribute $225,000 equivalent, mainly covering \noffice accommodation and counterpart staff. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are \nprovided in Appendix 2. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA \nSpecial Fund. Parallel cofinancing could materialize during the implementation stage. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE) will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The \nGovernment-appointed  Steering  Committee  for  Power  Sector  Restructuring,  composed  of \nsenior  Government  officers  and  chaired  by  the  Secretary,  MOPE,  will  supervise  the \nrestructuring  work  and  guide  the  consultants  and  other  associated  work  groups  or \nsubcommittees. The day-to-day work of the consultants will be done in close association with \nthe Power Sector Reform Office (PSRO), which reports to MOPE and is responsible for the \ndetailed work related to power sector restructuring matters. The steering committee will continue ", "4 \nto meet on a monthly basis, or more often if necessary. ADB staff will participate in these \nmeetings.  \n \n16.  Consultants will be engaged by ADB under the TA to assist the Government with the \ndetailed restructuring of the power sector. For this work, an international consulting firm or \nconsortium, in association with domestic consultants, will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will provide about 24 person-months of \ninternational  consulting  services  for  establishing  the  regulatory  commission  and  the  new \ngenerating, transmission, and distribution companies; and about 25 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services to assist in the unbundling process. The consultants will have relevant \nexperience in unbundling a power sector and establishing new companies. In particular, the \nareas of expertise sought are legal, corporate financial analysis and accounting, and power \nsystem planning and operations. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are provided \nin Appendix 3. The consultants will be required to follow the detailed implementation plan \napproved by the steering committee. The TA is expected to commence on 30 June 2002 and \nwill be finished by 30 December 2003. The major reports required from the consultants and the \nnumber of months after TA commencement by when the reports should be submitted are: \n \n(i)  an inception report to describe in detail the work program of the TA, with a time \nschedule and detailed work assignments (one month); \n \n(ii)  monthly status reports describing progress of work, and status in accordance \nwith  the  original  work  program  (from  the  second  month  to  the  end  of \nassignment); \n \n(iii)  a draft final report describing the assignment on an overall basis, and highlighting \nany unfinished tasks (17 months); and \n \n(iv)  a final report, which is the draft final report after incorporating the Government\u2019s \nand ADB\u2019s comments (18 months), including a suitable summary for posting on \nthe ADB website. \n \n17.  ADB missions will meet with the consultants and the Government periodically throughout \nthe TA period, to review progress and provide guidance as required. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Restructuring the Power \nSector\uf8e7Phase II, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \n   \n1  To ensure that in  \u2022  Ensure adequate total \nfuture electricity will  financing for power \nbe supplied in Sri  sector development, \nLanka in adequate  with total investments \nquantities, in an  of about $300 million \nefficient manner, and  annually to serve load \nwith tariffs that  growth of about 8%, or \nachieve full cost  about 150 megawatts \nrecovery overall.
