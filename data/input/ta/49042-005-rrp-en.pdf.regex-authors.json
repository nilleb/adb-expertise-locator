THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the additional financing of the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Corridors 2, 5, and 6 (Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa) Road Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing will support an increase in the scope of the current \nproject  by  constructing  a  40-kilometer  (km)  road  section  connecting  Chashmasoron  to \nKurgonteppa in Khatlon Province,2 improving safety on priority sections of the national highway \nnetwork, and continuing to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Transport \n(MOT).3 The overall project will improve the connectivity between the capital Dushanbe and \nKurgonteppa, which are two major cities and economic hubs in Tajikistan, and enhance the safety \nof the national highway network. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Tajikistan depends heavily on its road transport corridors to support investment, job \ncreation, trade, and ultimately economic growth and poverty reduction. Almost 70% of the \npopulation lives in rural areas, in a largely mountainous territory where only 10% of the land is \nsuitable for cultivation. The road transport sector suffers from low quality, long travel times, and \npoor reliability. Four CAREC regional corridors (2, 3, 5, and 6) cross parts of Tajikistan, offering \nthe opportunity for Tajikistan to enhance its connectivity and trade competitiveness. \n \n4.  The  government  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to \nprogressively upgrade the 82 km Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa road, for which ADB has programmed \ntwo projects: one in 2016 (current project) and one in 2018 (proposed additional financing).4 \nThe road is a strategic north\u2013south link, and one of the most heavily traveled roads in the country, \nas well as the confluence of CAREC corridors 2, 5, and 6. The project road passes through terrain \nthat varies from flat to mountainous. A further 90 km beyond Kurgonteppa, connects Dushanbe \nto Afghanistan. The government has also requested ADB assistance through the project to \nimprove several short sections of the national highway network that have substantial road safety-\nrelated deficiencies. \n \n5.  Current project. The current project that is improving 33 km of the road from Dushanbe \nto  Chashmasoron  was  approved  on  31  October  2016,  with  a  combined  loan,  grant,  and \nadministration of a grant of $67.2 million equivalent. The ADB loan and grants were signed on \n15 November 2017 and declared effective on 26 May 2017, with a closing date of 30 September \n2021. In addition, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International \nDevelopment (OFID) provided a $12 million loan for the current project, which is not administered \nby ADB. The OFID loan is effective and also has a closing date of 30 September 2021. \n \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan, Grant, and Administration of Grant to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Corridors 2, 5, and 6 (Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa) Road Project. Manila. \n2  Kurgonteppa was renamed Bokhtar in January 2018. \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the CAREC Corridors 2, 5, and 6 Road (Dushanbe\u2013\nKurgonteppa) Project (TA 8945-TAJ). \n4  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Tajikistan, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n \n ", "2 \n6.  The current project is rated on track to deliver its expected outputs and meet its intended \noutcome, with cumulative contract awards amounting to $42.3 million (61% of total loan and \ngrants financing) and cumulative disbursements amounting to $6.3 million (9%) against an \nelapsed time of 26% as of 13 February 2018. Disbursements will increase by the end of 2018, as \nhigh-value pavement works will have commenced by that time.5 \n \n7.  The project management and contract supervision consultant (PMCSC) contract was \nawarded on 28 June 2017 and the civil works contract was awarded on 28 September 2017. \nThe PMCSC was mobilized in August 2017 and the civil works contractor was mobilized in \nOctober 2017. The works commenced in November 2017 and are expected to be completed by \nOctober  2020.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been  fully  implemented  and  the  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) is being implemented without major issues. A grievance redress \nmechanism was established and there are currently no unresolved grievances or complaints. \n(output 1). Capacity building activities on financial management, road safety, and road asset \nmanagement are progressing as planned (output 2). The current project, through the PMCSC\u2019s \nsupport, has contributed to substantially improving the readiness of the additional financing, which \nwill  help  synchronize  the  award  of  the  PMCSC  and  main  civil  works  contracts  with  the \neffectiveness of ADB-provided financing (output 3). The risks identified during project preparation \nare being adequately managed with the PMCSC\u2019s assistance. \n \n8.  Proposed additional financing. Additional financing is sought to scale up the project by \nimproving a contiguous 40 km road section (Chashmasoron\u2013Kurgonteppa) to the current project\u2019s \n33 km road section. It is expected that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will \nhelp finance, through collaborative parallel financing, the remaining 9 km section in Kurgonteppa \nto complete the project road improvement. The additional financing will also support the MOT\u2019s \nprogram to improve the road safety situation on selected priority sections of the national highway \nnetwork, which may include existing tunnels, intersections, black spots, and failed lengths of \npavement. \n \n9.  The proposed additional financing will continue strengthening the MOT\u2019s capacity on \nfinancial management, road safety, and road asset management. The MOT will revisit and update \nits current standard technical specifications, which follow the highway construction standards \n(1998), to improve quality of bidding documents for typical road rehabilitation projects. The MOT \nwill also inventory and geo-reference the main bridges on the national highway network to build \nup the bridge module of the road asset management system, which is being developed with the \nWorld Bank\u2019s assistance.6 \n \n10.  Suitability  of  additional  financing.  The  proposed  additional  financing  meets  the \neligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing,  as  the  overall  project  is  (i)  technically  feasible, \neconomically viable, and financially sound based on the due diligence carried out; (ii) accorded \nhigh priority by the government as reflected by its inclusion in the National Development Strategy;7 \n(iii) consistent with the transport development objectives of the current project, as it will enhance \nthe outcome and outputs of the current project; and (iv) consistent with the country partnership \nstrategy, 2016\u20132020 for Tajikistan, which aims to improve physical connectivity and enhance \nregional integration.8 Given the strong links with the original project in terms of design and \n                                                \n5  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  World Bank. 2015.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nimplementation arrangements, the additional financing will offer substantial efficiency gains in \nproject processing and help meet the project outcome in a timely manner.  \n \n11.  Value added by ADB assistance. The current project enabled the introduction of clean \nenergy technology, in the form of solar-based LED road lighting and enhanced road safety \nfacilities, such as traffic calming and speed reduction elements, and much improved edge of road \ndrainage and protection features. These are essential and comply with current international \npractice.  They  would  not  have  been  incorporated  without  ADB  assistance.  The  proposed \nadditional financing will scale up these design elements to the entire project road (73 km). \nThe use of high-level technologies to inventory the main highway bridges, which may include \ndrone-based inspections and cloud database systems, will also be explored. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The overall aggregate impact of the project will remain unchanged as a result of the \nadditional financing. The overall project will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) the strategic \npillar on promotion of economic growth of the Tajikistan National Development Strategy (footnote \n7), and (ii) CAREC\u2019s strategic goal of establishing competitive corridors across the CAREC \nregion.9 The overall aggregate outcome will be improved efficiency and safer movement of goods \nand people on selected sections of the Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa road, and improved safety on the \nnational highway network.10 \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The proposed additional financing will enable expansion of existing outputs and include a \nnew output to address safety deficiencies on the national highway network. The overall aggregate \noutputs will be (i) improved road conditions, facilities, and safety along, and in the vicinity of, the \nproject road (expanded); (ii) strengthened institutional capacity of the MOT regarding financial \nmanagement, road safety, and road asset management (expanded); (iii) completed procurement \nreadiness for the Chashmasoron\u2013Kurgonteppa road section (unchanged); and (iv) improved \nsafety on selected priority sections of the national highway network (added). \n \nD.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $90 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The government has also \nrequested grant financing from JICA, which will be parallel and collaborative, and will not be \nadministered by ADB. \n \n16.  The government will provide counterpart funding of $17.5 million equivalent to cover taxes \nand duties, land acquisition and resettlement costs, incremental administrative expenses, and \nother miscellaneous costs.

The MOT will be the \nexecuting agency and its project implementation unit for roads rehabilitation (PIURR) will be the \nimplementing agency. The PIURR will be assisted during project implementation by relevant MOT \ndepartments and the PMCSC to be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, \nas amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time).  \n ", "5 \n \n18.  The civil works contracts will be supervised by the PMCSC, which will render the following \nservices: \n \n(i)  Contract supervision. The PMCSC will function as the engineer in administering \nthe civil works contracts in accordance with the conditions of the contract, and will \nadvise the employer on all matters concerning implementation of the contracts, \nincluding quality control, work progress, and dispute resolution. \n(ii)  Project management. The PMCSC will provide support to the employer for \nenvironment  and  resettlement  monitoring,  road  safety  audits,  financial \nmanagement, and design and procurement for the selected safety improvements \nworks on the national highway network. \n \n19.  The proposed small civil works will be high-priority and urgent network improvement works \nthat have safety and asset management benefits. The works selected will have no resettlement \nimpacts and minimal environmental impacts, and shall be completed no later than the physical \ncompletion of the project road. \n \n20.  JICA and ADB agreed that each of their respective policies and procedures will be followed \nin (i) the procurement of works and goods, and the use of consulting services to be financed by \ntheir respective loans and grants; (ii) the disbursement arrangements and establishment of \naccounts used for payments from their respective loans and grants; (iii) the reporting mechanisms \nand auditing of project accounts relating to their respective loans and grants; and (iv) the \nmeasures against fraud, corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. \n \n21.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  The  design  of  the  Chashmasoron\u2013Kurgonteppa  road  section  (additional  financing) \nessentially follows the standards and specifications used for the Dushanbe\u2013Chashmasoron road \nsection  (current  project).  Present traffic  volumes  range from  approximately  7,000  to  9,000 \nvehicles per day. As with the current project, the civil works under the proposed additional \nfinancing will consist of (i) expanding the road width from two to four lanes to address projected \ncapacity  constraints,  (ii)  improving  the  road  surface  condition  through  construction  of  new \npavements, and (iii) providing well-designed safety facilities to address existing road safety \ndeficiencies. \n \n24.  The completed road will have two carriageways, each with two traffic lanes typically \n3.5 meters wide, separated by a median typically 2.0 meters wide in rural areas and narrower \nwhere the road passes through villages and difficult mountain terrain. The project road alignment \nwill follow the existing road alignment because of terrain considerations and to minimize land \nacquisition, with some adjustments to horizontal and vertical alignments to meet the required \nstandards. The design speed will typically be 100 km per hour, which is appropriate for a road of \nthis class in the terrain through which it passes. \n \n25.  The completed road will have a flexible pavement with asphaltic concrete surfacing. \nThe pavement structure has been designed using appropriate design methods based on the traffic \nprojected to use the road over a 20-year period (2021\u20132040) following project completion, \nassuming one asphaltic concrete overlay during this period to provide the additional strength \nrequired for traffic loading for the latter part of the road\u2019s service life. The road design takes into \naccount the severe weather conditions that the road will experience, which range from high \ntemperatures in summer to below freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall in winter. Adverse \nweather  events  beyond  projected  parameters  may  however  be  a  risk  that  could  delay \nconstruction. \n \n \n ", "7 \n26.  Relevant disaster risks and climate change adaptation measures have also been factored \ninto the design, which are estimated to cost $900,000. The road design meets internationally \naccepted standards and practices in terms of road safety, which have been introduced and piloted \nthrough the current project. The design will be subjected to detailed road safety audits before \nconstruction commences, during construction, and prior to final acceptance of the completed \nroad. The road safety audits will be conducted in close coordination with the traffic police. The \nroad design also reflects consultations with communities living adjacent to the road, which have \nresulted in the inclusion in the project road\u2019s design of several underpasses for people, livestock, \nand agriculture, as well as pedestrian crossings with appropriate warning devices. The smaller \nsafety-related works will be designed in accordance with the same standards as the project road \ndesign.  \n \n27.  This technical due diligence has confirmed that the project road\u2019s technical design, \nalignment,  cross-section,  drainage  structures,  pavements,  and  road  safety  provisions  are \nappropriate for a road of this standard in this location, and for the volume of traffic that is projected \nto use it. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n28.  Economic viability. The economic evaluation of the project was undertaken using the \nhighway development and management model, and following ADB guidelines.13 For the economic \nanalysis, the with-project scenario assumed the improvement of the 39.6 km road section from \nChashmasoron to Kurgonteppa. Without the project, the road is expected to deteriorate to an \naverage international roughness index value of 9 within about 7 years, rendering it in very poor \ncondition. Future traffic was estimated based on classified traffic counts conducted in 2016 and \n2017, and available gross domestic product growth forecasts. The project is economically viable \nwith an estimated economic internal rate of return of 15.4%, with a net present value of $20.1 \nmillion at a 12% discount rate. The principal quantifiable benefits are reduced vehicle operating \ncosts, reduced travel time, and reduced maintenance costs. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the \neconomic viability of the project is robust against project cost increases of up to 34% and \ndecreases in vehicle operating costs savings of up to 27%. \n \n29.  Financial sustainability. The project is nonrevenue generating. The design of the project \nroad pavement and structures has been carefully developed with a view to ensuring the road\u2019s \nlong-term  sustainability.  The  project  will  support  the  development  of a  tailored  road  asset \nmanagement system in close coordination with other development partners (e.g., the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development,  JICA, and the World Bank), all of which have \noperations that involve some forms of operation and maintenance. The government is committed \nto maintaining the project road and facilities at the required standard as reflected in the grant \nagreement.14 The financial analysis concluded that the MOT has sufficient financial capacity, \nwithin the government\u2019s budgetary procedures, to meet recurrent expenditures to operate and \nmaintain the project road in a sustainable manner. \n \nC.  Governance \n30.  Financial management. The proposed additional financing does not entail any changes \nin the existing financial management arrangements. Financial management functions under the \nproposed additional financing will remain the responsibility of the PIURR, as under the current \n                                                \n13 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); ADB. 2017. Guidelines \nfor the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n14 Grant Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nproject. The original financial management assessment concluded that the financial management \nrisk of the implementing agency is substantial, which remains relevant for the overall project. The \nPMCSC team for the current project includes an international financial management specialist \nand a national financial management specialist who will both assist the PIURR in implementing \nkey actions and measures to address the deficiencies identified in the financial management \nassessment. The MOT and PIURR will maintain adequate and separate project records and \naccounts, which will be audited annually by an independent auditor. \n \n31.  Procurement. The procurement classification for the current project (category B) remains \nrelevant  for  the  overall  project  since  procurement  arrangements  will  not  be  changed. \nThe MOT and PIURR have an adequate understanding of ADB\u2019s procurement and financial \nmanagement policies and procedures as a result of the sizeable portfolio of ADB-supported \ntransport  operations  in  Tajikistan.  The  PMCSC  team  for  the  current  project  includes  an \ninternational procurement specialist who will assist the PIURR with procurement of contracts for \nthe proposed additional financing, including for small road safety works. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Integrity Principles and Guidelines and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) were explained to and discussed with the government, the MOT, and the \nPIURR.15 The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nproject administration manual (footnote 12). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n33.  The project will directly benefit residents in Dushanbe, Kurgonteppa, and 19 villages \nlocated along the project road by improving access to jobs, markets, and public services while \nreducing the likelihood and severity of road collisions. The project will also enhance the reliability \nand efficiency of power solutions along the project road by introducing solar-based street lighting \nand power backup systems for communities living adjacent to the project road. Socioeconomic \nsurveys were carried out for project preparation and a summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy was prepared.16 \n \n34.  The  gender  categorization  for  the  current  project  (some  gender  elements)  remains \nrelevant for the overall project since the additional financing is essentially scaling up the project \nfollowing the same project design elements. The current project design already addresses the \ngender issues identified during the project preparation, which include increasing safety features, \nenhancing connectivity of villages (pedestrian crossings and livestock underpasses), constructing \nbus stops, improving rest areas and road bazaars, and promoting confidence in the new road \nconfiguration through road safety awareness training and workshops. The current project also \ncontributes to reducing women\u2019s household drudgery with improved access to electricity through \nthe installation of power backup solutions. The MOT and PIURR are taking all necessary actions \nto encourage women living in the project area to participate in planning and implementing project \nactivities in line with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998). \n \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement impacts. The census carried out during project preparation identified approximately \n246 affected households\u2014including private agriculture plots, owners and users of land and \nbuildings, business owners, renters, and employees\u2014with 1,956 household members affected. \nOf the 246 affected households, 92 households with 766 members will experience severe impacts \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2015. Integrity Principles and Guidelines.

A total of 18 residential buildings and 39 main business buildings will be permanently \nimpacted. The small road safety-related works will not have impacts on resettlement. \n \n36.  A land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) has been prepared to mitigate and \naddress all the associated losses in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nrelevant national legislation.17 The LARP was disclosed on the ADB website in January 2018. \nConsultations with the project stakeholders and displaced persons were undertaken during LARP \npreparation and will continue throughout implementation. If modification of the LARP is required, \nor additional land requirement or involuntary resettlement impacts are identified, the LARP will be \nupdated in accordance with applicable laws, and ADB approval will be obtained prior to any further \nimplementation. All displaced people will receive compensation in accordance with the LARP \nprovisions. The land required for the project will be made free of encumbrances in sections prior \nto commencement of construction. A grievance redress mechanism is in place in accordance with \nthe LARP to assist affected persons in resolving grievances and complaints. The MOT will submit \nsemiannual safeguards monitoring reports to ADB for review and disclosure. \n \n37.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environmental  impacts. \nThe environmental assessment established that the project will have site-specific environmental \nimpacts related to air and water pollution, noise and vibration, soil erosion, loss of roadside trees, \nrelocation of utilities, and traffic disruption during the construction stage. Additionally, it was found \nthat the project could result in split communities, disruption of farming patterns, and loss of access \nto roadside businesses during road operation. \n \n38.  An initial environmental examination and an EMP have been prepared for the project and \nwere disclosed on the ADB website in January 2017, in accordance with the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement.18 Public consultations were conducted during initial environmental examination \npreparation involving people from roadside villages, nongovernment organizations, and other \nproject stakeholders. Adequate mitigation measures are included in, and will be implemented \nthrough, the EMP. The project design incorporates measures for preserving community cohesion \nsuch as improved road crossings, access to public facilities, and access of agricultural machinery \nto fields and livestock to pastures. The cost for implementing the EMP will be financed by the \nproject  through  the  civil  works  contract  (mitigation  measures)  and  the  PMCSC\u2019s  contract \n(environmental monitoring). \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples. There are no indigenous peoples, as defined in the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, in the project area, and thus the project is classified as category C for \nindigenous peoples\u2019 impacts. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The project risks are considered manageable \nthrough the prescribed mitigating measures. Integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. \n \n                                                \n17 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate financial monitoring  The PMCSC team for the current project includes an international financial \nand reporting systems  management specialist and a national financial management specialist who will \nboth support the PIURR in reviewing and strengthening its financial reporting \nand monitoring system by providing adequate tools and on-the-job training \nduring project implementation. \nInsufficient allocation of funds to  The government and ADB have agreed on a covenant to ensure that the project \nmaintain the project road and  road and facilities will receive timely and adequate maintenance.
