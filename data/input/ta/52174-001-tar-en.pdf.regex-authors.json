The proposed Emergency Assistance Project will support the Government of Bangladesh \nin addressing the urgent needs of the  displaced persons from Myanmar in Coxsbazar District, as \nidentified by the United Nations (UN) in its Joint Response Plan (JRP) (displaced persons).1 The \nproject is aligned with the following impact: social recovery of displaced persons in Teknaf and \nUkhia camps accelerated.2 The project will have the following outcome: living conditions and \nresilience of displaced persons improved. The project will improve water supply and sanitation, \ndisaster risk management, sustainable energy supply, and access roads. The project is estimated \nto cost $120 million ($100 million through an Asian Development Fund grant and $20 million from \nthe Government of Bangladesh).3  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) will support government agencies,4 including the Refugee \nRelief and Repatriation Commission (RRRC)5 and implementing agencies,6 in (i) strengthening \nand sustaining institutional and technical capacities; (ii) planning, designing, and implementing \nthe proposed subprojects; and (iii) establishing an effective monitoring and evaluation system.  \n \n3.  The emergency assistance project will be implemented by multiple implementing agencies   \nand the project is envisaged to substantially use the advance fund procedure. The risk due to \nweak capacity of accounting staff to adequately manage the internal controls and financial \nmanagement is high. Financial management assessment of the implementing agencies has \nindicated that the consolidation of expenditures and their liquidation will be a challenge. Similarly, \nnoncompliance with the financial management system can expose the project to fiduciary risks \nand audit objections.  \n \n4.  The project follows the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The \nimplementing agencies need support in familiarizing with the new ADB procurement policies. \n                                                \n1 UN, Strategic Executive Group. 2018. 2018 JRP for Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis, March\u2013December 2018. Cox\u2019s \nBazar. Various terminology is used in media, official and unofficial documents to describe the affected people. \nTerminology used herein is intended solely to identify such people for the purposes of this paper, and not to assert \nany view regarding the manner or circumstances of such persons\u2019 displacement. Such terminology may not reflect \nthe terminology used or accepted by any government or any agency thereof. ADB expresses no view and takes no \nposition herein regarding the legal rights or political assertions or the characterization of any such persons. The use \nof the term \u201cdisplaced persons\u201d in this paper is not intended to have the same meaning as the term \u201cdisplaced \npersons\u201d defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n2  Defined by the project. \n3  The provision of a grant to Bangladesh from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Special Fund resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund [ADF]) for the project is subject to the Board\u2019s approval of a separate proposal (submitted in \nparallel to this paper) waiving provisions of applicable ADB policies that would otherwise prohibit such grant support. \nPrior to submission of this proposal to the Board, ADF donors endorsed the allocation of $100 million in ADF \nresources to provide special grant support to Bangladesh for the project. \n4  Government agencies include the divisions of the line ministries who are responsible for executing the projects, such \nas Local Government Division under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operatives; Road \nTransport and Highways Division under the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges; and Power Division under the \nMinistry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources; and the Deputy Commissioner of Coxsbazar.  \n5  RRRC is a designated coordinating agency acting on behalf of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief for \ninteragency coordination and support for displaced persons in Coxsbazar. \n6 Implementing agencies include (i) Local Government Engineering Department; (ii) Department of Public Health \nEngineering; (iii) Roads and Highways Department and (iv) Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board. \n ", "2 \nBeing an emergency project, procurement actions need to be fast-tracked using open competitive \nbidding with local advertisement, limited competitive bidding, request for quotation, or direct \ncontracting, as appropriate. Fast-tracking procurement activities require additional procurement \nsupport to executing and implementing agencies. Lack of transparency, collusion among the \ncontractors, and nontransparency in distribution of goods and equipment to beneficiaries are \nforeseen.  Substantial  monitoring,  audit,  reviews,  and  procurement  support  will  be  needed \nthroughout project implementation.  \n \n5.  Risk assessment during project due diligence has indicated that the likelihood of weak \ncapacity  and the  lack of  dedicated key  staff will  hamper  subproject selection, fast-tracked \nimplementation, and the timely completion of due diligence. Subproject selection, preparation and \napproval of development project proforma and technical assistance project proforma, and project \nimplementation are challenging under capacity constraints and low subprojects\u2019 readiness. The \nimplementing agencies are not prepared to deal with the scale of the emergency project at short \nnotice. The project will need strong support in subproject selection, project planning, design, \npackaging, and procurement (including contract management).  \n \n6.  Because of the influx of new population into the communities, the risk of increased human \ntrafficking, drug trafficking, and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV) is high. Awareness-\nraising programs on the gender equity and social inclusion action plan will need to be conducted \nin all campsites throughout the project period. Some project areas may fall under the protected \nforest and critical natural habitat, which will need a high level of safeguard due diligence during \nsubproject selection and implementation. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Institutional capacity strengthened. The TA will focus on enhancing the \nproject implementation capacity of government and implementing agencies by providing capacity \nbuilding and resource support in (i) procurement; (ii) financial management and audit; (iii) project \nmanagement; (iv) environmental and social safeguards, (v) disaster risk management and climate \nresilience; and (vi) gender empowerment and social inclusion. In addition to a full-time financial \nmanagement consultant, ADB staff will provide capacity support to project implementation unit \nstaff on ADB\u2019s financial management requirements and disbursement guidelines  to ensure \nrobustness  and  transparency.  A  project  liaison  office  in  Coxsbazar  will  be  established  to \ncoordinate and facilitate subproject development, implementation, and monitoring. The TA will \nsupport the government\u2019s RRRC and the liaison office on logistics including vehicles, office \nequipment, and capacity building. \n \n8.  Output  2:  Planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  the  proposed  subprojects \nsupported. The TA will mobilize adequate national consultants to help implementing agencies \novercome their capacity constraints and low readiness on subproject selection, technical and \nsafeguard due diligence, design, procurement, and contract management. TA consultants for \neach sector will support (i) the preparation of development project proforma, technical assistance \nproject proforma including technical and economic due diligence and bid documents; and (ii) bid \nevaluation. Similarly, project implementation units will be reinforced with consultants to help with \nconstruction supervision, safeguard application, sound application of communication strategy, \ngender equity and social inclusion action plan, and reporting. In addition, pilot testing of project \napproach will be supported. \n \n9.  Output 3: Effective monitoring and evaluation established. A well-functioning project \nmonitoring and management information system will be established in four project implementation \n  ", "3 \nunits and their district counterparts to monitor progress on procurement, quality of equipment and \ncivil works, contract management, implementation, fund flows, accounting, audit, and reporting \nfunctions.  TA  consultants  will  operationalize  the  system  through  a  project  liaison  office  in \nCoxsbazar. Quarterly coordination meetings among ADB, RRRC, the local deputy commissioner, \nUN agencies, and development partners will be held at the liaison office.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,100,000, of which $3,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) of ADB. The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, office accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, local transportation, and other \nin-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will administer the TA. The Bangladesh Resident Mission will select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants; and procure goods under the TA. The overall consultants\u2019 inputs will be \nfinalized in consultation with the implementing agencies. The TA will be implemented over 36 \nmonths from July 2018 to June 2021. \n \n12.

Consulting services. Consultant recruitment will follow the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions. TA implementation will be carried out through national individual consultants \n(279 person-months). Consulting firms, if required, will be recruited through open competitive \nbidding procedures, local advertisement, and/or limited competitive bidding using quality- and \ncost-based selection method, simplified technical proposal, or biodata technical proposal. Other \nselection methods such as consultants\u2019 qualification-based selection is also envisaged. Individual \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  following  individual  selection  method,  international  or  local \nadvertisement, based on project requirements. Consultants engaged in ADB-financed projects \nfor similar services may either be extended or selected through single-source selection, subject \nto the satisfactory performance of the consultant. This arrangement will provide an efficient way \nto recruit consultants under the circumstances. Some social and gender studies and support may \nbe provided using local nongovernment organizations. The option to have a direct contract or \nmemorandum of understanding with nongovernment organizations and/or UN agencies already \nengaged in the project area will also be explored, as appropriate.  \n \n14.  Consulting  services  will  commence  in  July  2018,  to  be  rendered  full  time  and/or \nintermittently until June 2021.7 \n \n15.  The  consultants  will  support  the  preparation  of  engineering  designs  for  the  typical \nsubproject such as (i) mini piped water supply systems with production tube wells (chlorinated, \nsolar-powered, groundwater-based); (ii) integrated waste management (both fecal and solid \nwaste) and resource recovery facilities (with collection system) at the outskirts of the camps; (iii) \nconstruction of surface water treatment plants for supporting water supply at Coxsbazar District \nand surrounding areas, with a capacity of 350 m3 per hour water intake from Bankhali river; (iv) \nsurface water reservoirs and associated facility to expand the existing surface water treatment \nsystem from 300 m3 to 450 m3 per day; (v) construction of 33/11 kilovolt (10 megavolt-ampere) \nsubstation at Palongkhali (Ukhiya); and (vi) installation of mini-grid solar system for household \nelectricity use within the camp (150 households per cluster). The consultants will also support in \nfinalizing design scheme tender packages for all other subprojects. \n \n16.  Pilot testing. The TA will support the pilot testing of (i) a thunder and lightning alert system \nat the campsite by establishing a weather station and a mobile application, and (ii) a biomass \nwaste-to-energy production. The scope, sites, permits and clearances, and treatment of assets \nof the pilot test will be finalized in consultation with RRRC and implementing agencies during the \ninception mission. The activities will not result in any potential adverse environmental and/or \nsocial impact. The procurement plan will be prepared and updated once the scope of the pilot test \nis finalized. \n \nE.  Governance \n \n17.
