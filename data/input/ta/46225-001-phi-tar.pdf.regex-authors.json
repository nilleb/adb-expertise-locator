INTRODUCTION \n1.   In September 2011, the Government of the Philippines, through its Climate Change \nCommission (CCC), requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to conduct a pilot study on the Upper Marikina River Basin Protected Landscape,1 as a \ndemonstration site for the eco-town framework as espoused in the National Climate Change \nAction Plan, 2011\u20132028 (NCCAP).2 An eco-town is a planning unit comprising a group of \nmunicipalities located within and around the boundaries of critical biodiversity areas, and is used \nas an implementation vehicle for the convergence of adaptation and mitigation actions, and for \ndemonstration of an integrated ecosystem-based management approach. The proposed TA3 \nseeks to pursue strategies for climate resilience and green growth in the Upper Marikina River \nBasin  Protected  Landscape  for  effective  integration  of  climate  change  concerns  into \ndevelopment plans at the level of local government units (LGUs) to reap multiple benefits in \nterms of environmental sustainability, job creation, and long-term economic growth. \n \n2.   A series of meetings took place from October 2011 to February 2012 between CCC and \nADB to clarify the outcomes and outputs of the proposed TA. CCC held additional consultations \nwith local stakeholders during this period. ADB circulated a draft TA concept paper for comment \nby government departments and other stakeholders. A consensus emerged on the need to \ndemonstrate the eco-town framework in the Upper Marikina River Basin Protected Landscape. \nFollowing a fact-finding mission, a memorandum of understanding was signed with the vice-\nchair of CCC on 22 May 2012, agreeing to the core elements of the TA (impact, outcome, \noutputs, cost, financing, implementation arrangements, and the consultant terms of reference). \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The country is \nranked highest in the world in terms of vulnerability to tropical cyclones and third in terms of the \npopulation\u2019s  exposure  to  floods  and  droughts.4 The  National  Economic  and  Development \nAuthority estimated that economic losses from typhoons, floods, and landslides in 2011 equaled \nP59.2 billion. Enhancing the climate resilience of the economy and the adaptive capacity of the \npopulations is thus crucial for sustainable development. \n \n4.  Climate change-induced economic losses are particularly high in urban and peri-urban \nareas largely because of the increasing fragility of urban ecosystems and the low adaptive \ncapacity of communities. The need to develop ecologically stable and economically resilient \nurban areas or \u2015eco-towns\u2016 has been recognized but the concept has not been demonstrated. \n \n5.  To address climate change, the government enacted the Climate Change Act of 2009 \n(Republic Act 9729), which established the CCC as the government\u2019s sole policy-making body \ntasked  with  coordinating, monitoring,  and  evaluating  programs  and  action  plans  related  to \nclimate change. The Climate Change Act provided the principles guiding the formulation of \nNCCAP, which prioritizes food security, water sufficiency, ecosystem and environmental stability, \nhuman  security,  climate-smart  industries  and  services,  sustainable  energy,  and  capacity \n                                                \n1  Proclamation No. 296 of 24 Nov. 2011, issued by the President of the Philippines, defines the Upper Marikina River \nBasin Protected Landscape as covering the Marikina watershed reservation situated in the city of Antipolo, and the \nfour municipalities of Baras, Rodriguez, San Mateo, and Tanay in the province of Rizal.  \n2  Climate Change Commission. 2011.

(p. 43) \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 18 May 2012. \n4  Climate Change Commission. 2010. National Framework Strategy on Climate Change 2010\u20132022. Manila.  \n ", "2   \ndevelopment.    The  NCCAP  is  based  on  the  building  of  eco-towns  at  the  local  level. \nDemonstration of the eco-town framework, through implementing priority climate resilience and \ngreen growth measures, is expected to not only address the impacts of climate change on \ncommunities but also bring about sustainable development and poverty reduction benefits. \n \n6.  The TA seeks to pursue strategies for green growth and climate resilience in the Upper \nMarikina River Basin Protected Landscape. The area was chosen because of its (i) high bio-\nphysical vulnerability to climate change impacts; (ii) high levels of urban poverty and population \ndensity with settlements in vulnerable locations; and (iii) high demonstration potential to the rest \nof the country, in terms of mainstreaming climate resilience and green growth, and eco-town \ndevelopment.  \n \n7.   The TA has strong links to the Philippines Development Plan, 2011\u20132016,5 especially \nwith regard to goal 3 (enhanced resilience of natural systems and improved adaptive capacities \nof human communities to cope with environmental hazards, including climate-related risks) of \nthe strategic framework for conservation, protection, and rehabilitation of the environment and \nnatural resources. The TA has robust linkage to ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy 2011\u20132016 \nand  its  thematic  assessment  paper  on  climate  change  and  disaster  risk  reduction,6 which \nrecognises the urgent need to increase the resilience of the Philippines to climate change and \nnatural  disasters  while  harnessing  opportunities  for  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  mitigation.  In \naddition to contributing to the objective of strengthening the capacity of national and local \ninstitutions, the TA closely aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,7 Southeast Asia Department\u2019s \nclimate change implementation plan,8 and various sector assessments, strategies, and road \nmaps in terms of increasing resilience to climate stresses (agriculture and natural resources \nsector), promoting use of renewable energy (energy sector), and enhancing water sanitation \nthrough effective waste management (urban development sector).  \n  \n8.   The TA builds on vulnerability assessment methodologies developed under the ADB-\nfunded regional TA on adaptation9 and disaster risk reduction projects undertaken in Manila and \nother  areas.  It  will  promote  synergies  with  ADB  lending  programs  such  as  the  proposed \nIntegrated  Natural  Resources  and  Environmental  Management  project,  aimed  at  restoring \ncritical watersheds in four upper river basins. The TA will benefit from other climate change \nprojects funded by the German Agency for International Cooperation, the Global Green Growth \nInstitute,  and  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development.  The  TA  is  considered \nessential, however, as the eco-town framework has not yet been demonstrated in the Upper \nMarikina River Basin Protected Landscape.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The expected impact is enhanced climate resilience and green growth in the Upper \nMarikina  River  Basin  Protected  Landscape.  Improvements  in  resilience  will  be  monitored \n                                                \n5  National Economic and Development Authority. 2011.

The expected outcome is that by the end of TA, LGUs in the Upper Marikina River Basin \nProtected Landscape have increased capacity to mainstream climate resilient and green growth \noptions  in  development  plans,  programs,  policies,  and/or  projects.  The  capacity  to  bring \ntogether the concepts of low-carbon development, resource efficiency and adaptation to climate \nchange will be strengthened. By doing so, LGUs can significantly contribute to the achievement \nof the Millennium Development Goals, especially with regard to poverty alleviation (goal 1) and \nenvironmental sustainability (goal 7). Demonstration of the eco-town framework will advance the \npursuit of green growth and reduce the impacts of climate change on communities, while also \ncontributing to sustainable urban development and poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The proposed TA includes (i) creation of a \u2015green growth road map\u2016 for the Upper \nMarikina River Basin Protected Landscape based on local circumstances, political leadership, \nthe capacity for change, and the needs and priorities of stakeholders; (ii) preparation of an \ninventory of GHG emissions, assessment of vulnerability to climate change, and economic \nvaluation of ecosystem services; (iii) identification and prioritization of interventions to adapt to \nthe impacts of climate change and trigger green growth; (iv) development of local climate \nchange  action  plans that  can  be  integrated  into  comprehensive  development  plans  of  the \nconcerned LGUs; and (v) piloting of selected green growth and resilience measures. The TA will \nconsider five dimensions relevant to green growth\u2014(i) economic development; (ii) resilience to \nclimate change; (iii) biodiversity, ecosystems, and social development; (iv) GHG emissions \nreductions; and (v) poverty alleviation\u2014in the delivery of the following four outputs.  \n \n12.   Output 1: Collection of baseline information, and assessment of vulnerability to \nclimate change. This output is aimed at stocktaking and vision setting based on consultations \nwith diverse stakeholders, including vulnerable communities, and women. The baseline will be \ndefined to illustrate the business-as-usual path for economic growth, environmental quality, and \nsocial development in the absence of climate change measures. Baseline will be determined \nthrough (i) data collection; (ii) review of development plans and literature; (iii) survey of  local \ninstitutions, governments, and businesses; (iv) vulnerability assessment (including likely future \nclimate change scenarios and localized impacts);  (v) economic valuation of natural resources \nand ecosystem services; and (vi) GHG emission inventory. Scenario setting will be conducted to \nproject future trends in usage of the natural resources and their associated impacts. To the \nextent possible, the GHG emissions inventory at the LGU level will be prepared following the \nglobal protocol for community-scale GHG emissions.10  \n \n13.   Output  2:  Identification,  analysis,  and  prioritization  of  locally  appropriate \nadaptation and mitigation measures. This output aims to identify measures with the most \nsignificant impact across the five dimensions relevant to green growth. A menu of options will be \ndeveloped by first preparing an inventory of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures \n                                                \n10  ICLEI-Local  Governments  for  Sustainability  and  C40  Cities  Climate  Leadership  Group  published  a  draft \ncommunity protocol for GHG emissions.

A short list of options will then be prepared on the \nbasis  of  feedback  from  stakeholders\u2014including  vulnerable  communities,  women,  and  the \nprivate sector\u2014on the feasibility of implementing such measures. A multi-criteria cost-benefit \nanalysis will be used to assess the business-as-usual scenario and proposed measures to \nestablish potential outcomes across the five dimensions relevant to green growth. \n \n14.   Output 3: Selection of pilot demonstration areas and implementation of gender-\nequitable  adaptation  and  mitigation  measures.  Based  on  specific  criteria,  sites  will  be \nchosen to implement priority adaptation and GHG mitigation measures such as promoting \nrenewable energy, forest rehabilitation and reforestation, and creation of alternative livelihoods \nfocusing on sustainable management of natural resources. The primary focus of the TA will be \non non-structural measures, although a few cost-effective structural measures may be piloted. 11 \nLGUs will implement such measures by involving local communities including vulnerable groups, \nwomen and the private sector. Community-based activities that improve climate resilience and \nlivelihood diversification of women, children, and marginalized groups will be prioritized.  \n \n15.   Output 4: Development of knowledge products and strengthening of stakeholder \ncapacity. This output is aimed at (i) disseminating the TA findings to decision-makers from the \ngovernment, industry, and civil society through workshops and seminars; (ii) documenting the \nprocess for future reference of stakeholders in demonstrating the eco-town framework in other \nareas; (iii) preparing local climate change action plans and guidelines for effective integration of \nclimate change concerns in development plans; and (iv) strengthening  the capacity of key \nstakeholders (including women and the private sector) in vulnerability assessment, economic \nanalyses, and piloting of climate change actions. Knowledge products will be developed on the \nbasis of an iterative learning process to reflect on-the-ground experiences and realities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nClimate  Change  Fund. 12   The government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in the form  of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented for 2 years from 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2014. \nADB will be the executing agency. CCC will be the implementing agency, in close collaboration \nwith the Protected Area Management Board, LGUs in the Upper Marikina River Basin Protected \nLandscape, and other agencies such as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources \nand the Department of Interior and Local Government.  \n \n                                                \n11 Structural  measures  include  any  physical construction  to  reduce  or avoid possible impacts  of  hazards,  or \napplication of engineering techniques to achieve hazard-resistance and resilience in structures or systems. \nNonstructural measures are any measures not involving physical construction that uses knowledge, practice or \nagreement to reduce risks and impacts, in particular through policies and laws, public awareness raising, training \nand education.

The TA will finance an estimated 64 person-months of national consultant inputs (for six \nconsultants,  in  the  areas  of  climate  change  adaptation,  mitigation,  natural  resources \nmanagement, capacity building and gender mainstreaming, geographic information systems \nand multimedia), to be engaged through a consulting firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The quality- and cost-based \nselection method (90:10) and simplified technical proposal procedures will be followed. The \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Procurement and disbursement will be \ndone in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) \nand ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). For surveys including baseline data collection and demonstrations, an advance payment \nfacility may be used.  \n \n19.  CCC  will  be  responsible  for  coordination  and  implementation  of  all  TA  activities, \nincluding effective monitoring of the work progress of consultants. CCC will assign a senior staff \nmember as the focal person to coordinate project activities and delivery outputs of the TA. CCC \nwill  also  designate  an  alternate  staff  member  to  assist  the  focal  person.  ADB  will  accept \nconsulting firm\u2019s claims upon receipt of a CCC endorsement certifying that work was done \nsatisfactorily for the period, with the corresponding progress reports attached.   \n \n20.  CCC will serve as the focal organization among involved LGUs and national agencies. \nCCC will organize a project technical working group comprising representatives from Protected \nArea  Management  Board,  LGUs  in  the  Upper  Marikina  River  Basin  Protected  Landscape, \nagencies  such  as  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources,  Department  of \nInterior and Local Government, Department of Energy, Department of Science and Technology, \nDepartment  of  Transportation  and  Communications,  National  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  and \nManagement Council, academia, civil society organizations and the private sector. All LGUs in \nthe Upper Marikina River Basin Protected Landscape will be involved in capacity building and \npiloting specific climate actions. CCC will work with the LGUs in the formulation, signage, and \nimplementation of the memorandum of agreement between CCC and the LGUs stipulating that \n(i) CCC will provide the necessary technical and financial support from ADB; while (ii) the LGUs \nwill provide free access to data, information and facilities, ensure safety and security of the \nproject personnel, and facilitate effective coordination among stakeholders in implementation of \nthe local climate change action plans and demonstration of the eco-town framework.  \n \n21.   Progress of the TA will be monitored using intended outcomes and outputs described in \nthe design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). With support from the consulting firm, CCC \nwill submit quarterly progress reports to ADB. CCC will monitor project progress in accordance \nwith  the  project  implementation  schedule,  and  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant \ndeviations from the schedule. Within 3 months of the TA\u2019s completion, CCC will submit a project \ncompletion report to ADB. The form and content of the reports will be agreed upon by ADB and \nCCC during the TA inception mission.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.
