The Asian Development Outlook (ADO), a flagship publication of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), is an important vehicle to promote ADB\u2019s knowledge and expertise about the \nregion, providing insights into the economic issues faced by Asia and the Pacific. Its content \ninforms  ADB  Management  opinion  and  guides  institutional  views  about  the  region\u2019s \nmacroeconomic prospects and important development issues. The production of the ADO has \nbeen regularly supported by technical assistance (TA) funding.1 The objectives, scope, and \nactivities to be covered by the regional TA are in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Inclusive economic growth is one of the three development agendas under Strategy \n2020.3 The ADO, by regularly providing comprehensive analysis on evolving developments in \nADB developing member countries (DMCs), provides a basis for understanding the key drivers \nof and constraints on economic growth\u2014a critical element for inclusive economic growth as a \npriority research area. This important role of flagship publications such as the ADO in monitoring \nthe major economic issues and trends of DMCs was recognized in the TA Strategic Forum 2008. \nAlso, under ADB\u2019s streamlined business processes, the ADO has become the main reference \nfor the economic assessment and outlook section of country partnership strategies.  \n \n3.  The ADO is one of the publications most frequently downloaded from ADB\u2019s website.4 It \nis a source of much international and national news commentary that features analysis, views, \nand opinions from ADB. Thus, a concerted effort to produce a high-quality publication every \nyear is vital to elevate the publication\u2019s profile and ensure its relevance and usefulness in \nresearch and policy dialogues and formulation in ADB DMCs. For example, the ADO has \nrecently  featured  in-depth  analysis  on  such  topics  as  rebalancing  growth,  macroeconomic \nmanagement beyond the global financial crisis, inequality in developing Asia, and the energy \nchallenge in Asia. Discussion of these topics has important policy implications as developing \nAsia strives to sustain long-term growth in the face of global uncertainties. \n \n4.  Rapid economic growth has lifted hundreds of millions of Asians out of poverty and \nvastly improved the region\u2019s living standards in the past few decades. Nevertheless, throughout \ndeveloping Asia demand for more inclusive growth is rising, partly in response to widening \ninequality. 5 More specifically, there are growing calls for governments to play a more direct role \nin narrowing disparities and helping disadvantaged groups. Government intervention to promote \nmore inclusive growth depends heavily on fiscal policy, e.g., government spending programs \nthat benefit the poor and progressive taxation to generate sufficient revenue fairly. \n \n5.  Another topic that has become important for developing Asia is in the area of global \nsupply chains (GSCs) and trade in value added. The fragmentation of production processes and \nthe  rise  of  GSCs  since  the  1980s  have  become  increasingly  important  factors  in  linking \ndeveloping  countries  to  international  production  networks  and  markets.  A  large  share  of \n                                                \n1  ADO 2014 was identified as a corporate priority TA in the resource allocation meeting held in January 2013. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 July 2013. \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n4  From 2007 to 2013, the ADO and ADO Update have consistently ranked among the top ADB downloads from the \nmonth of launch until the following year. Their launches have regularly generated significant coverage in both \nglobal and regional top-tier media, such as the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal Asia, and International Herald \nTribune. \n5  Developing Asia refers to the 45 developing member countries of ADB. \n ", "2   \nproduction within GSCs is now taking place in developing countries, especially in East Asia and \nSoutheast Asia. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the TA will be for the ADO to influence the environment within which policy \nformulation in selected DMCs occurs. The outcome will be citations of the ADO by the media \nand by economic researchers within ADB and beyond. Appendix 2 contains the outline of ADO \n2014 and ADO 2014 Update. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The main outputs of the TA will be the disseminated ADO 2014, ADO 2014 Update, and \nADO  Supplement  reports.7 The  TA  will  support  the  following  key  activities:  (i)  preparing \nbackground analytical papers; (ii) further developing and refining analytical methods; (iii) drafting \nADO content; (iv) economic editing and copyediting; (v) preparing and laying out materials for \npublication; and (vi) disseminating key results and policy messages. The TA will also support \ninitiatives to build capacity for macroeconomic modeling, generating growth projections, and \nmonitoring markets. These initiatives will be linked to a bigger plan within the Economics and \nResearch  Department  (ERD)  to  build  a  \u201cmodeling  culture\u201d  within  ADB,  and  will  include \neconomists in the regional departments, especially those involved in preparing the country \nchapters, and possibly the Office of Regional Economic Integration. Several activities for the \npreparation of ADO 2015 may be supported under the TA.  \n \n8.  Continuous effort should be exerted to improve the analytical rigor and policy relevance \nof the reports if they are to remain a credible, independent source of knowledge and information \nabout  Asia  and the  Pacific.  Background  research  papers  to  provide a  solid  empirical  and \nanalytical  foundation  for  ADO  content  will  be  produced  under  the  TA.  These  papers  will \nsupplement the research of the Macroeconomics and Finance Research Division (ERMF) on \nthe selected theme topics, analyzing issues and policy implications for the DMCs covered. \nThese papers will be consolidated in an edited research volume to provide researchers with \nmore extensive background information and analyses related to the theme topic. The research \nvolume may be copublished with a reputable publishing house and will likely entail a buyback \narrangement. \n \n9.  Building on the recommendations of ADO 2012: Confronting Rising Inequality in Asia, \nthe theme chapter for ADO 2014 will focus on fiscal policy for inclusive growth. The ADO 2014 \ntheme  chapter  will  analyze  the  current  state  of  the  relationship  between  fiscal  policy  and \ninclusive  growth  in  the  region,  considering,  for  example,  whether  taxation  is  generally \nprogressive and whether government programs promote equality. It will study the international \nexperience of the relationship between fiscal policy and inclusive growth in advanced countries \nand Latin America. Advanced countries have a long history of using fiscal policy to reduce \npoverty and inequality, and Latin America offers some interesting case studies of, for example, \nconditional cash-transfer schemes. Based on the analysis of current fiscal policy in the region \nand international experience, policy lessons will be drawn to guide developing Asia\u2019s policy \nmakers on how best to leverage fiscal policy for more inclusive growth. Of utmost importance for \n                                                \n7  The ADO Supplement is a short report prepared by the Regional Economic Outlook Task Force to provide \nquarterly updates of macro forecasts between ADO and ADO Update releases.  \n ", "  3 \nAsia are fiscal policies that enhance inclusion without compromising fiscal sustainability or \neconomic growth.  \n \n10.  ADO 2014 Update will build on the results of research and development TA on Global \nSupply Chains and Trade in Value Added. The Update\u2019s theme chapter will focus on answering \ntwo questions of relevance for Asia\u2019s involvement in the global supply chains (GSCs): (i) How \nhave GSCs affected trade and production in Asia, and what does this say about the future of \nFactory Asia? (ii) How do GSCs help to transmit supply and demand shocks across countries, \nand do they magnify or dampen these shocks?  \n \n11.  The theme will focus on issues such as the development and future of Factory Asia, \nGSCs and occupational transitions in Asia, the GSC linkages at the corporate level with detail \non geography and company type, and the impact of GSCs on macro phenomena like the \nnarrowing of global imbalances. The theme will also look at the relationship between GSCs and \nmacro stability by analyzing the intensity with which a GSC demand or supply shock transmits \nacross borders; the relative quantitative importance of demand shocks in explaining changes in \nAsian trade and output during several recent downturns; the effect of natural disasters on trade, \nemphasizing  failures  in  supply  chains  as  the  potential  transmission  mechanism;  and  the \nvulnerability of production in Asia to other shocks. \n \n12.  The  TA  will  support  the  development  and  refinement  of  analytical  methods  to \nsupplement ADB\u2019s short- and medium-term country economic monitoring and reporting. This will \nstrengthen the economic underpinnings of country programs and strategies for the DMCs, \nthereby making economic policies better informed and designed and enhancing ADB\u2019s country \nassistance. \n \n13.  Workshops and conferences will be organized as part of ADO preparation to strengthen \nthe content. The writers\u2019 workshop, which will be co-organized with the HR Policy and Programs \nDivision, will focus on macroeconomic analysis of current issues, growth accounting, economic \nprojections and macroeconomic modeling, and effective writing skills. The workshop will target \nselected economists and national staff in regional departments and resident missions who are \nresponsible for writing the country chapters. This will impart skills that are of broader relevance \nto the economic and sector work that underpins country strategies. The conferences will focus \non the reports\u2019 theme chapters. Distinguished economists in the region will be invited to discuss \ninitial drafts of the background papers to improve the analytical rigor and policy relevance of the \ntheme chapters. \n \n14.  To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in approach across the ADO and the \nedited volume of background research papers, high-quality editing services will be provided by \ninternational consultants. \n \n15.   The publications will be widely disseminated in collaboration with the Department of \nExternal Relations (DER). The international media launch will be followed by presentations \ncohosted by ADB development partners within and outside Asia and the Pacific. Outreach will \ninclude analytical discussions of the issues in partnership with academic institutions and think \ntanks. \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency, responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA. \nGiven the high institutional profile of the ADO, the chief economist will report to the vice-\npresident for knowledge management and sustainable development and to the President at \ncritical points in the publications\u2019 preparation. The TA is expected to start in September 2013 \nand be completed by 30 June 2015. \n \n18.  The production of the ADO will be a joint effort (led by ERMF) of ERD economists, \ncountry  economists  of  the  regional  departments  and  resident  missions,  national  experts, \ninternational consultants, and economics editorial advisors. As in previous years, ERMF will \ncollaborate with regional departments and resident missions to prepare the country chapters. \nFor the theme chapters, experts within ADB will be consulted. ERD may explore institutional \npartnerships  with  global  centers  of  excellence  if  appropriate.  For  example,  the  East\u2013West \nCenter of the United States, which leads the national transfer accounts database project, is a \npotential institutional partner, especially on fiscal sustainability and economic growth dimensions. \nFor global supply chains and trade in value added, ERD has been exploring the opportunity for \njoint work with the Fung Global Institute. The research output of the collaboration with this \nregional center of excellence will be tailored to provide the policy focus of the Update\u2019s theme \nchapter.  \n \n19.  The TA will require 18 person-months of international consultancy from economists who \nwill prepare the background papers and analyses on issues pertaining to the theme topic. In \naddition, the TA will require an estimated 25 person-months of international economic advisory \nand editing consultants\u2019 time for the economic and technical editing of ADO manuscripts before \nthe final publication of ADO 2014 and ADO 2014 Update. The TA will also require 7 person-\nmonths  of  national  economic  consultants\u2019  time  to  assist  in  conducting  research  on \nmacroeconomic topics, and another 6 person-months will be needed for the desktop publishing \nand graphic design requirements of the publication. Consultants will be hired as individuals.8 \nResource persons will be engaged for a maximum of 10 working days to conduct training on \nmacroeconomics and economic forecasting and may also serve as discussants during the \nworkshops.  Consultants  and  resource  persons  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for the consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 4.  \n  \n20.  The TA will finance the procurement of information and knowledge services such as \nsubscription to macroeconomic data providers as may be required to inform relevant and up-to-\ndate  content.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  accord  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Information and knowledge \nservices will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n                                                \n8  The TA will involve independent studies and require the rapid mobilization of consultants to ensure that there are \nno delays in the publications\u2019 tight production schedules. In addition, the experience and qualifications of the \nindividual consultants will be the primary considerations. Thus, the consultants will be hired on an individual basis.  \n ", "  5 \n \n21.  Workshops will be conducted to review and discuss the initial country chapters and \nbackground papers prepared for the ADO. They are tentatively scheduled for December 2013, \nFebruary 2014, May 2014, and July 2014 at ADB headquarters. The TA may cover travel \nexpenses of selected resident mission staff participating in the workshops as resource persons. \n \n22.  The TA will support dissemination by ERD and DER. The major results and key policy \nmessages emerging from ADO 2014 and ADO 2014 Update will be disseminated to the media, \nDMC policy makers, and academic communities. The media launch and subsequent roadshows \nwill be undertaken by ERD in coordination with DER. Separate launches will be undertaken by \nresident missions in selected DMCs in coordination with their regional departments and DER. \nRoundtable discussions and workshops in different academic and economic institutions will also \nbe conducted to reach a wider audience. Both ADO 2014 and ADO 2014 Update will be \nfeatured on the ADB website, and copies, either in print or on CD-ROM, will be distributed \nworldwide. ADO Supplement reports will be produced in between the publication of the ADO \nand the ADO Update to provide updated assessment on the DMCs. The TA may also support \nthe translation of the ADO into other languages, as may be required, to support dissemination in \nselected DMCs. This will be arranged by regional departments in coordination with resident \nmissions and DER. \n \n23.  As team leader, the assistant chief economist (ACE), ERMF will monitor the work under \nthe  TA  to  ensure  its  effective  implementation.  ERD  researchers  will  review  the  work  of \nconsultants  engaged  to  verify  that  tasks  are  completed  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of \nreference and that draft reports are delivered on time, with the ACE, ERMF managing the \ncombined outputs of the consultants. Peer review of papers within ADB and, if possible, by \nother research and academic institutions will be used to evaluate the quality and depth of \nanalysis of the research papers. The ACE, ERMF will set the production schedule; assure that \nadequate  staff  are  assigned;  and  be  responsible  for  meeting  the  deadlines  for  the  timely \ndelivery of publications. The success of dissemination will be monitored through web download \nstatistics and media monitoring reports provided by DER. \n \n24.  Outputs and outcomes will be evaluated to measure the success of the TA. ERMF \nevaluation  of  the  overall  ADO  process  will  be  conducted  to  determine  strengths  and \nweaknesses as well as areas for improvement that will serve as inputs for the next ADO. \nMonitoring and back-to-office reports on the ADO and ADO Update launches will also be \nreviewed to gather feedback on the publications and learn lessons from them. \n \n \nIV.
