During the 2005 Country Programming Mission for the People's Republic of China (PRC), \nthe Government confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) to prepare integrated roads \ndevelopment projects in Gansu Province and Sichuan Province.1 The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in June 2005; traveled to the project areas; carried \nout an initial poverty and social assessment (IPSA) and rapid environmental assessment (REA); \nand discussed economic, social development, and project-specific issues with officials of the \ncentral and local governments. This report is based on the understanding reached with the \nGovernment  on  the  objectives,  scope,  costs,  terms  of  reference,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA, and the Mission's observations in the field. A design and monitoring \nframework, outlining the impact, outcome, outputs, and activities, is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  PRC\u2019s economic growth over the last decade has substantially increased the demand for \ntransport  services.  The  economy\u2019s  changing  structure  and  increasing  diversification  have \naltered the pattern of transport demand. The demand for road transport has outpaced that of \nother transport modes. There is a need to rapidly move goods and passengers by roads, which \nare more flexible and responsive than other modes to the needs of a market economy. The shift \nin  transport  demand  also  reflects  the  loosening  of  anticompetitive  restrictions  in  the  road \ntransport industry itself. Between 1990 and 2004, road traffic grew by 9.0% yearly for passenger \ntraffic,  reaching  876.5  billion  passenger\u2500kilometers  (km);  and  by  6.0%  yearly  for  freight, \nreaching  759.7  billion  ton\u2500km.  In  2004,  roads  accounted  for  53.7%  of  the  country\u2019s  total \npassenger traffic and 11.4% of the total freight traffic. With the country\u2019s rapid economic growth, \nlow vehicle ownership rates, and large investment in automotive manufacturing, rapid expansion \nin the vehicle fleet will continue in the coming years. PRC\u2019s road network was 1.86 million km in \n2004, an increase of 46,000 km from 2003. Of this, the expressway length increased from 29,745 \nkm to 34,200 km during the same period.2 However, the road network is still underdeveloped in \nquality and extent. High-standard roads3 account for only about 14% of the total road network; the \nremaining 86% (class III road and below) are medium- to low-grade paved and gravel roads. With \nonly 1,431 km of roads per million inhabitants and 19.4 km per 100 km2 in 2004, the density of \nPRC's road network is low, resulting in serious transport capacity constraints and bottlenecks. \n \n3.  The road network in Gansu Province is underdeveloped in both quality and extent. In 2004, \nGansu\u2019s road network accounted for 2.2% of the country\u2019s total, with 40,751 km. Of this total, \n31,614 km comprised: 686 km of expressways, 143 km of class I roads, 4,826 km of class II \nroads, and 25,961 km of class III\u2013IV roads. Unclassified roads covered 9,137 km. The road \ndensity in Gansu was 9.0 km per 100 km2, lower than the national average; and the proportion \nof road class II and above is significantly lower than the national average. In Sichuan Province, \nthe road network also remains underdeveloped. Sichuan\u2019s road network accounted for 6.1% of \nthe country\u2019s total, with 113,043 km. Of this, 76,401 km comprised: 1,758 km of expressways, \n1,496 km of class I roads, 9,633 km of class II roads, and 63,514 km of class III\u2013IV roads. \nUnclassified roads covered 36,642 km. The road density in Sichuan was 23.3 km per 100 km2, \nslightly higher than the national average, but the proportion of road class II and above  is \nsignificantly lower than the national average. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 5 April 2005. \n2  The PRC has the world\u2019s second longest expressway system after the United States. \n3  This is defined as roads above class II that are generally capable of accommodating 3,000\u20137,500 vehicles per day \nin medium-sized truck equivalent within the expected design life. ", "2 \n4.  The impact of road investments on poverty reduction is supported by the results of \nstudies and evaluations of several completed road projects financed by ADB4 and the World \nBank.5 Well-integrated  road  development  helps  ensure  that  the  benefits  derived  from  the \nexpressway filter down to the poor. Benefits from transport cost savings and time savings, along \nwith an increase in incomes, will be passed on through the transport chain to townships and \nvillages. The results affirm the relevance of ADB\u2019s strategy in the PRC road sector. A case \nstudy in Shaanxi Province found that improved roads correlated with poverty reduction, and that \n(i) 3.2 poor people are lifted out of poverty for every CNY10,000 invested in roads; and (ii) for \nevery 1% increase in kilometer of road per capita, household consumption increases by 0.08%.6  \n \n5.  While the national trunk highway system is being developed, accessibility in most of \nPRC\u2019s rural area is still low. Currently, 145 townships and 50,124 villages, most of which are in \nthe western region, have no access to all-weather roads. Many townships and villages still \ndepend on earth tracks that are not suitable for motorized traffic and become impassable during \nrainy season. Even where all-weather roads have been built in the past, the standard of rural \nroads is low, maintenance is poor, and many roads are in need of rehabilitation. In view of the \nneed to improve rural accessibility, the central Government completed 71,000 km of rural roads \nat the cost of CNY60.9 billion, supported by the local governments that constructed 68,000 km, \ncosting CNY57.6 billion in 2004. The Government plans to invest CNY100 billion in developing \nrural roads during the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). By 2010, all villages in the eastern \nregion will be linked with paved roads.  The same targets will be applied to 80% of villages in \nthe central region and 90% of towns in the western region. The Government\u2019s commitment to \nreducing  poverty  through  transport  infrastructure  investment  is  reflected  in  the  poverty \npartnership agreement between the Government and ADB.7 \n \n6.  Gansu Province is one of PRC\u2019s five northwestern provinces. Remote and isolated, with \nharsh natural conditions, it is one of the least developed provinces. Its key problem is poverty: \nthe per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 2004 was CNY5,898, only 57% of the national \naverage of CNY10,502. Per capita rural income was CNY1,852, or 63% of the national average \nof CNY2,963. Despite considerable investments, the road network is still inadequate and does \nnot provide efficient transport access to markets and social services, such as education and \nhealth. The number of poor rural people below the provincial poverty line of CNY882 is 261,500 \n(33.6%) in the project area. One of the reasons for the high poverty incidence is slow economic \ngrowth, due partly to inadequate infrastructure, particularly poor local road conditions. Despite \nconsiderable investments, the road network is still inadequate, and does not provide efficient \ntransport access to many parts of the province. \n \n7.  Sichuan Province is situated in southwestern PRC, with mountains on all sides. Its \nisolation  has  been  reduced  by  improved  navigation  on  the  Yangtze  River,  by  railway \nconstruction, and by the construction of several major highways. The majority of its population \nare concentrated on the flat, fertile plain in the east and central part, but it has several poverty- \nstricken  areas  on  its  mountainous  periphery.  Despite  rapid  development  in  recent  years, \n                                                 \n4  In Liaoning and Yunnan provinces, construction of expressways, complemented by upgrading local roads, was \nassociated with a significant increase in rural incomes in the project area. This is reported in ADB. 2000. Project \nCompletion Report on the Liaoning Expressway Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila; and ADB. 2001. \nProject Completion Report on the Yunnan Expressway Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n5  Hajj, Hatim, and V. Setty Pendakure. 2000.

", "  3 \nSichuan ranks seventh lowest of all provinces in per capita GDP: CNY7,514 in 2004, or 72% of \nthe national average. The per capita rural income was CNY2,580, or 88% of the national \naverage. Of the 2.12 million people in the project area, 216,700 poor people, or 10%, live below \nthe provincial poverty line of CNY1,000. One of the reasons for the high incidence of poverty is \nslow economic growth due partly to inadequate infrastructure. As in Gansu, the road network is \nstill inadequate, particularly the local roads, and does not provide efficient transport access. \n \n8.  The proposed project in Gansu will be the second in that province to be funded by ADB. \nThe first project8 is being implemented satisfactorily. The Gansu Provincial Communications \nDepartment  (GPCD)  has  experience  in  implementing  three  internationally  financed  road \nprojects.9 Lessons learned from these projects will be incorporated in the project design. The \nproposed project expressway, planned for completion in 2013, forms a southern section of the \nLanzhou-Sichuan corridor and constitutes a 132-km access-controlled 4-lane expressway (Map). \nIt will connect with Chengdu and Chongqing, two major growth centers in the southwestern \nregion.  The  expressway  is  located  in  high  mountainous  terrain,  and  involves  extensive \nconstruction of tunnels and bridges that will account for 56% of the expressway\u2019s total length. It \npresents a technical challenge, and therefore, a careful review of the design and construction \nmethods will be an important feature of the TA. The existing road in this area is 269 km long, with \nsteep gradients and many sharp turns, so the average vehicle speed on this road is low. The \nexpressway will shorten the distance by more than 50%.  Recent traffic counts indicate that the \ncurrent traffic on the existing road is 2,776 vehicles per day, and has been growing at about 5% \nper annum in the last decade. The existing road conditions are deteriorating in some sections due \nto poor maintenance and are affecting road safety. \n \n9.  The proposed project in Sichuan will be the fourth project under ADB financing that will be \nundertaken by the Sichuan Provincial Communications Department (SPCD). The first project10 \nwas completed successfully and opened to traffic in December 2003, while the second project 11 \nis progressing well. The third project12 is being processed for consideration in 2005. Lessons \nlearned from these ADB-financed projects will be incorporated in the project design. The proposed \nproject expressway, connecting Dazhou and Wanyuan in eastern Sichuan, constitutes a 138-km \naccess-controlled  4-lane  expressway  (Map).  It  forms  part  of  the  eight  western  development \ncorridors  between  Arongqi  and  Beihai  that  will  provide  an  important  link,  connecting  the \nnorthwestern  and  southwestern  regions  by  2015.  The  expressway  is  located  in  hilly  to \nmountainous terrain, and involves extensive construction of tunnels and bridges that will account \nfor 38% of the expressway\u2019s total length. The proposed project presents a technical challenge; \ntherefore, a careful review of design and construction methods will be an important feature of the \nTA. The existing road in this area is 142 km long, with steep gradients and many sharp turns, so \nthe average vehicle speed on this road is low.  Recent traffic counts indicate that the current \ntraffic on the existing road is about 2,580 vehicles per day, and has been growing at about 4% to \n9% per annum in the last decade.

ADB's operational strategy13 in PRC\u2019s road sector is designed to remove infrastructure \nconstraints and support policy and institutional reforms. Since 1991, ADB has provided 30 \nloans, totaling nearly $5.6 billion, to finance about 4,100 km of expressways, together with 7,600 \nkm of associated local road networks. Since 1995, local roads have been included in the scope \nof road projects to make ADB\u2019s interventions in the road sector more pro-poor. All the ADB \nloans are generally being implemented satisfactorily.14  The strategy supports (i) constructing \nroads  that  connect  major  growth  centers  and  improve  access  in  the  western  and  central \nregions;  (ii)  integrating  the  national  trunk  highway  system  with  local  road  networks;  (iii) \npromoting road safety and vehicle emission reductions; (iv) strengthening the corporatization \nand commercialization of expressway organizations; (v) adopting appropriate pricing policies to \nensure optimum use of road transport capacity; and (vi) using alternative methods of investment \nfinancing, including private sector participation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.   The TA will help create an integrated road transport system supporting sustainable \neconomic growth in Gansu and Sichuan provinces. The TA will (i) assist GPCD and SPCD in \nupgrading  the  feasibility  studies,  including  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs)  and \nresettlement plans for the ensuing projects in conformity with ADB\u2019s requirements; and (ii) \nreview road sector issues and provide the basis for strengthening the ongoing policy dialogue \nwith the Government in the key areas, focusing on the poverty impact of road projects, road \nsafety, vehicle emissions, commercialization and corporatization, private sector development, \npricing policies for road users, and public transport services. The output will be projects suitable \nfor ADB financing. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The IPSA and REA carried out during fact-finding for the Gansu and Sichuan portions \n(Appendix 2) helped identify the social and environmental issues that need to be addressed \nduring project preparation. The fact-finding also reviewed the need for assessing the social and \nenvironmental aspects for which ADB has established policies and norms of good practice. The \nIPSA examined poverty conditions, minority issues, resettlement effects, gender issues, and \nvulnerable groups, and concluded that the key social issues to be assessed during project \npreparation are poverty impact and resettlement effects. The IPSA concluded that both projects \nshould be in involuntary resettlement category A,15 requiring a full resettlement plan. The REA \nconcluded that both projects should be in environmental category A, requiring a full EIA. The TA \nwill examine the available project documents, and prepare projects that are feasible from the \ntechnical, economic, and financial points of view and are in compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard \npolicies on the environment, resettlement, and indigenous people. The TA will help develop a \nresults-based monitoring system with adequate baseline data. The key activities will include \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2005.

Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent comprising $490,000 in \nforeign exchange and $510,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $800,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $310,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent \nto  $200,000,  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and  other  support \nservices. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  Two  teams  of  consultants  from  an  international  consulting  firm  in  association  with \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  using  the  simplified  technical  proposal \nprocedures  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The TA will require about \n17  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  32  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services to carry out the study as defined in the terms of reference (Appendix 4). The \ninternational consultants will have expertise in the following fields: (i) highway engineering, (ii) \ntransport  economics,  and  (iii)  financial  analysis/expressway  operation.  The  international \nconsultants  will  utilize  domestic  consultants  with  expertise  in  (i)  highway  engineering,  (ii) \ntransport economics, (iii) financial analysis/expressway operation, (iv) environmental analysis, \n(v) poverty and social analysis, (vi) resettlement, and (vii) road transport services. \n \n15.  GPCD and SPCD will be the Executing Agencies (EAs) for the respective parts of the TA. \nThey  will  appoint  suitable  counterpart  staff  who  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  and \ncoordinating TA activities, including monitoring of progress, resolving any issues that may arise \nduring implementation, assisting in arranging meetings, and liaising with various Government \nagencies and organizations. The Ministry of Finance will ensure coordination among the National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission,  Ministry  of  Communications,  State  Environmental \nProtection Administration, GPCD, SPCD, and other government offices relevant to the TA. The \nconsultants are expected to be fielded by November 2005, and their work will be carried out over \n4.5 months, with completion in April 2006. Workshops involving the Government, ADB, and the \nconsultants will be held in the PRC to review the consultants' reports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  preparing  the  Western  Roads \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nTargetsa  Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nAn integrated road  The gross domestic  Provincial and county  \u2022 Government and ADB \ntransport system  product and rural  statistics office  sign loan agreement. \nsupporting  income increase in     \nsustainable economic  the project areas.    \u2022 Project design is \ngrowth in Gansu and      implemented \nSichuan provinces  Poverty incidence in  Provincial and county  effectively as agreed \n  project areas  poverty reduction office  upon during appraisal. \ndeclines.     \n    \u2022 Forecast economic \nA road transport  Provincial  growth rates are \nsystem integrating  communications  realistic and \nlocal road and  departments and  achievable. \ntransport services will  project completion   \nbe established.   report   \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nProject design and  Memorandum of  Memorandum of  \u2022 Government is willing \nfeasibility study  understanding signed  understanding  to address necessary \nimproved to a level  by Government and    changes in priorities. \nsuitable for ADB  ADB during appraisal    \u2022 Government obtains \nfinancing and agreed  mission of July 2006     necessary sources of \nupon by Government    funding. \nand ADB   \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.

Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe project will directly contribute to poverty reduction in the project area by generating construction \nemployment opportunities in the short term and improving access to market for specialty cash crops, such \nas medicinal herbs and mushrooms. The project will substantially improve transport infrastructure that will \nfacilitate  economic  development  and  thereby  indirectly  provide  greater  employment  and  income- \ngenerating opportunities for local people.   \n \nFurther, the project will improve access to social services in the county centers and larger cities. The local \npeople have poor transportation and very basic education and medical facilities. Poverty incidence in the \nproject area is estimated to be 12% (320,700 people) based on the national poverty line of CNY668 \nincome per capita and 37% (996,700 people) based on the provincial poverty line of CNY919 income per \ncapita. \n \nA detailed poverty analysis will be carried out to identify the causes of poverty in the project area and \ndemonstrate how the project will help reduce poverty by incorporating specific measures in the project \nscope. The analysis will be based on the Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis and Handbook for \nIntegrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \nc.

Consulting services will fall into seven major categories.  The consultants\u2019 specific tasks \nunder each category are described in the following paragraphs. \n \nA.  Highway Engineering \n  \n2.  Review all technical aspects in the feasibility studies and available engineering designs. In \nview of the difficult topography in the project area, undertake a thorough technical review including \n(i) horizontal and vertical alignment; (ii) subsurface investigation, particularly where tunnels are \nproposed; (iii) availability and quality of local construction materials; (iv) pavement, bridge, and \ntunnel design options; (v) drainage facilities; (vi) siting and configuration of interchanges, toll \nstations,  and service areas; (vii) provision for cross-expressway access; and (viii) road safety \nfeatures.  Assess  the  need  for  reviewing  the  prefinal  design  documents  for  major  structures, \ndepending on their complexity; and if found necessary, carry out the review before finalizing the \ndocuments. \n \n3.  On the basis of traffic  volumes, forecast traffic, traffic  mix,  and axle loads,1 review the \nadequacy  of  the  proposed  road  capacity  and  pavement  design,  and  recommend  measures  to \nprevent overloading on the project expressway, e.g., installing vehicle weighing stations at selected \nentry points, and other measures. \n \n4.  Prepare an inventory of the local roads for each county of the project area. Identify an \nimprovement  program  for  secondary  and  tertiary  road  networks,  including  provincial,  county, \ntownship, and village roads. Incorporate the local roads development program into the project and \ndesign it to enhance the distribution of the anticipated project benefits to the hinterland and the \nrural population in the project area. Give particular attention to including roads in poverty and \nminority  counties  and  townships  as  appropriate.  Review  the  local  government\u2019s  road  asset \nmanagement  systems  at  provincial,  county,  township,  and  village  levels,  and  recommend \nmeasures for improvement. \n \n5.  Review  bills  of  quantities,  unit  prices,  and  costs  of  (i)  civil  works  for  expressway \nconstruction and road improvement, and (ii) equipment and other facilities to be procured under the \nproject. Review the current road maintenance, operation, and management systems. Estimate the \ncosts  of  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  for  the  expressway  and  local  road  development \ncomponents. Recommend suitable road maintenance operation and management systems and \nnecessary equipment. Review and update the project cost estimates and indicate the foreign \nexchange (direct and indirect) and local currency costs, giving due consideration to the actual costs \nof recently awarded contracts of a similar nature in Gansu and Sichuan. \n \n6.         Review (i) current design methodology in relation to road safety; (ii) road safety monitoring \nsystem and latest accident statistics in Gansu, Sichuan, and the project area; and (iii) road safety \ndata and management systems in Gansu and Sichuan. Design a suitable road safety component \nfor inclusion in the project in discussion with the Executing Agency and the Provincial Public \nSecurity Bureau. \n \n7.  In cooperation with the social and poverty specialist and transport economist, explore the \npossibility of introducing the roadside station concept2 in the service areas or other suitable areas \nalong the expressways or other major roads as part of the project. \n                                                 \n1  If information about axle loads is not available, the consultants will undertake an axle loads survey along the project \nroads.  \n2  The concept was developed in Japan as part of road infrastructure to contribute to local community development, and \nit has been adopted in Thailand with assistance from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. See World Bank. \n2004. Guidelines for Roadside Stations.  Washington, DC. ", "18   Appendix 4 \nB.  Transport Economics \n \n8.  Review the current status and future plans (Tenth Five-Year Plan [10FYP] and Eleventh Five-\nYear Plan [11FYP] of road development in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Gansu Province, \nand Sichuan Province, including the project area (maps will be prepared for this purpose). Identify \nthe role of the project in the framework of the Western Development Strategy in supporting pro-poor \ngrowth and poverty reduction in the western part of the PRC in general and Gansu Province and \nSichuan Province in particular. \n \n9.  Review the revenue and expenditures in the Gansu and Sichuan road sector in the past \ndecade  and  make  projections  for  the  10FYP  and  11  FYP  (2001\u20132010).  Analyze  the  level  of \nexpenditures for maintenance of local roads (as against expressways and national highways) in the \npast decade and financing plans for future maintenance. Examine the role of the road sector in the \nfiscal position of the province and analyze how the sector contributes to poverty reduction. \n \n10.  Review  existing  traffic  counts  and  origin-destination  surveys,  and  obtain  any  additional \nnecessary information on the present pattern of traffic by vehicle type and mode in the zone of \ninfluence of the project.  Assess capacity of the existing road networks and the effects of the capacity \nconstraints on vehicle operating costs (VOCs), travel time, and patterns of transport movement. \n \n11.  Using the most recent data for each vehicle type, prepare traffic forecasts at a range of toll \nrates for the project for normal, generated, and diverted traffic. Traffic diversion from the railways and \nwaterways should also be assessed, as appropriate. Based on the effect of the toll rates on traffic \ndiversion, prepare traffic forecasts for the project at various toll rates. In developing the traffic \nforecasts, take into account the long-term gross domestic product and other forecasts for the PRC \nprepared by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n12.  Undertake economic evaluation in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Economic Analysis \nof Projects3 for the expressway and the local road components and for the project as a whole over \nthe construction and operation period by calculating the economic internal rate of return (EIRR).  \nTake into account construction, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, VOCs, passenger and \nfreight  time  savings,  producer  surplus,  accident  savings,  and  any  other  quantifiable  benefits \nattributable to the project. Undertake sensitivity analysis by appropriately varying benefits, costs, \nimplementation period, traffic diversion, generated traffic, shadow price factor, and a combination of \nthese  factors.  Calculate  switching  values  and  compare  with  evidence  for  existing  expressway \nprojects. The sensitivity analysis of the EIRR and the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) to \nchanges in the toll rates should cover a sufficiently wide range to indicate the toll level at which (i) the \nEIRR falls to the cutoff rate of 12% and (ii) the FIRR reaches the maximum value. Present the result \nof the sensitivity analysis graphically. Carry out risk analysis4 using the monte carlo method by \nconsidering the possible values for key variables based on past PRC experience, and the probability \nwith which they may occur. Recommend ways in which project risks can be reduced. With the \nassistance of the social and poverty specialist, carry out distribution analysis of project benefits, \ncalculate  the  poverty  impact  ratio,  and  undertake  a  cause-and-effect  analysis,  following  the \nmethodology set forth in ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \n13.  To  ensure  that  the  project  achieves  its  envisaged  objectives,  develop  a  results-based \nmonitoring  system,  using  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  in  an  ADB  format,  including \nmonitoring indicators that will be used to assess project performance, and baseline and target values \nfor  the  selected  indicators,  covering  economic,  transport,  socioeconomic,  poverty  impact, \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001.

", "    Appendix 4  19\nenvironmental, and resettlement aspects. Develop a detailed monitoring framework for selected \ntownships in the project area and a control area, and collect baseline data and target values for key \nindicators. Prepare implementation arrangements, including data sources and reporting mechanism. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis and Expressway Operations \n \n14.       Review and update the proposed financing plan of the project including the share of ADB, \nMinistry of Communications, Gansu Province, Sichuan Province, domestic banks, and other sources, \nas  appropriate.  Calculate  a  discounted  return  to  equity  over  the  project  life,  and  assess  its \nattractiveness  to  private  investment.  Review  project  cost  estimates  and  proposed  drawdown \nschedules  as  provided  by  the  engineers.  Compute  price  contingencies  and  interest  and  other \nfinancing charges during construction in accordance with Guidelines for the Financial Governance \nand Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank. Assess and \nprepare  financial  projections  for  the  proposed  operating  entity  over  10  years  of  expressway \noperation, including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements in nominal terms.  \n \n15.  Carry out financial evaluation for the project over the construction and operation period by \ncalculating the FIRR, using proposed toll rates, and compare it with the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC). The FIRR and WACC should be computed on an after-tax basis in real terms using \nconstant 2005 prices. In collaboration with the transport economist, determine and justify appropriate \ntoll rates by vehicle type, taking into account the relationship between the toll rates and cost of \nproviding the road services; and ensure consistency of approach and assumptions between financial \nand economic analyses activities. \n \n16.  Assess the financial management of the operating entities, including (i) corporate planning \nand budgetary control, (ii) financial and management accounting, (iii) cost accounting, and (iv) \ninternal control and audit system. Suggest appropriate financial covenants to monitor financial \nconditionalities  of  the  project.  In  light  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Governance\u2014Sound  Development \nManagement  (1995),  recommend  ways  to  improve  corporate  governance  of  the  expressway \noperating entity, e.g., by entering into a concession agreement with the provincial communications \ndepartment. \n \n17.  Review the current status of private sector participation in expressway development and \noperations in Gansu Province and Sichuan Province and assess the potential for operating the \nproject expressway as a corporation or as a concession by the private sector. Identify appropriate \narrangements to implement such a strategy, considering options such as leasing, securitization, joint \nventure, build-operate-transfer, and other arrangements for O&M. \n \nD.  Road Transport Service \n \n18.  Assess  the  provision  of  trucking  and  public  transport  services  in  the  project  area \nconsidering pricing, quality, and frequency of service. Assess the degree of competition and the \nproportion of the reduced transport costs that are likely to be passed on to end users.  Review the \ncurrent conditions of road transport services, including passengers and freight in Gansu in general \nand Longnan City in particular, and examine how such services could be improved to provide \nefficient services in poor remote areas. Recommend suitable components, e.g., public transport \ncenter, freight distribution center, improvement of bus services, and any others, for inclusion in the \nproject.  For Sichuan Province, review the current conditions of public transport in the project area \nand determine the need to incorporate the public transport component into the project so as to \nimprove services to poor remote areas. \n \n \n ", "20   Appendix 4 \nE.  Social and Poverty Analysis \n \n19.  Prepare socioeconomic and poverty profiles for the project area. Collect data through \nstatistical records, field surveys, key informant interviews, and participatory community appraisal \ntechniques. Include data on population, income levels, occupations, unemployment, education, \nhealth conditions, and other relevant socioeconomic data. Separate data by gender. The data and \nprofiles  should  be  sufficiently  comprehensive  to  serve  as  the  baseline  for  socioeconomic \nperformance indicators. Assess poverty incidence using the government poverty lines and $1 a day \n(equivalent to CNY900 per year). \n \n20.  Based on the initial poverty and social analysis, conduct a full poverty and social analysis in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis. Assess how the proposed \nproject  may  help  improve  people\u2019s  livelihood  systems.  Assess  gender  issues,  identify  ethnic \nminorities and other vulnerable groups, and recommend appropriate measures to address impacts \nand  promote  development  opportunities  during  construction  and  operations  of  the  project.  \nEstimate (i) the number of project beneficiaries by area, occupation, and income level (poor, low, \nmedium, and high); and (ii) the number of adversely affected people, by type of impact. If any \nethnic  minorities  are  affected,  formulate  special  measures  to  safeguard  their  livelihood  and \ncustoms. In particular, develop strategies to ensure project benefits accrue to ethnic minorities in \nthe Gansu project area. Specify how the project will improve benefits (market access, employment \nopportunities, lower transport costs, reduced travel time, etc.) for local people, by income group. \nRecommend measures to enhance benefits and minimize adverse impacts, particularly for the \npoor. The cost of such measures and the means for implementation will be clearly proposed for \npossible incorporation into a social development action plan implemented as part of the Project. \n \n21.  Assist in establishing consultation and participatory processes during project preparation \nthat will continue throughout project design, construction and operation.  Identify stakeholders and \nconsult representatives so that their needs and demands can be considered for incorporation into \nthe project or as parallel initiatives. \n \nF.  Environmental Impact Assessment \n22.  Review  the  project  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs),  as  prepared  by  the \nexecuting  agencies  (EAs),  to  ensure  they  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). Assist the EAs to carry out further investigations \nand  analysis,  as  required,  to  ensure  that  the  EIAs  conform  to  the  above  ADB  policies  and \nguidelines.  Finalize the EIAs by incorporating comments from ADB. Also prepare summary EIAs \n(SEIAs) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). \n \n23.  Ensure  that  each  EIA  includes  (i)  description  of  the  project;  (ii)  description  of  the \nenvironment,  including  physical  resources,  ecological  resources,  economic  development,  and \nsocial and cultural resources; (iii) assessment of project alternatives; (iv) anticipated environmental \nimpacts  (direct,  indirect,  induced,  and  cumulative)  and  mitigating  measures;  (v)  economic \nassessment;  (vi)  environmental  management  plan,  including  institutional  management  and \nmitigating measures for identified environmental impacts; (vii) environmental monitoring plan; and \n(viii) public consultation and information disclosure. \n \n24.  Based on a preliminary environment scoping, assess the major specific environmental \nconcerns, including (i) impacts on surface water, (ii) impacts on groundwater, (iii) impacts on air \nquality, (iv) soil erosion, and (v) impacts of construction activities on the community.  Estimate the \ncosts of implementing the proposed environmental mitigating measures and the environmental \nmonitoring  plan.  Assess  the  level  of  costs  against  expected  environmental  benefits,  where \npossible,  in  a  quantifiable  manner.  Assist  the  highway  engineers  in  incorporating  appropriate ", "    Appendix 4  21\nenvironmental  mitigating  measures  into  the  project  design;  make  recommendations  on  the \nenvironmental  training  requirements.  Prepare  contractor  specifications  for  environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring.  Prepare  the  terms  of  reference  and  budget  for  independent \nenvironment monitoring and evaluation. \n \n25.  Assist the EAs in conducting appropriate public consultation, as required, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s requirements. Public consultation and disclosure for this project (category A) requires \n(i) public consultation on environmental issues during the early stages of EIA fieldwork, and (ii) \npublic consultation on environmental issues when the draft EIA report is available, and prior to loan \nappraisal by ADB. Ensure that the EIA includes proposed measures for public consultation during \nproject construction and operation. \n \nG.  Resettlement Planning \n26.  Review the draft resettlement plan (RPs) and prepare modifications, as required, to comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), Handbook on Resettlement (1998), and other \nrelevant requirements. The RPs should address all project components including the expressway, \nlocal roads, access roads, and construction areas. Review the results of the socioeconomic profiles, \nvillage surveys and household surveys conducted by the EA (data should be disaggregated by \ngender). Quantify the types and degree of impacts on the affected people, including income levels \nand sources, housing conditions, occupations, expenditure patterns, landholdings, skills base, and \nassets (production and living). Assess the socioeconomic condition, needs, and priorities of women \naffected by land acquisition and resettlement; and identify specific measures to assist them and \nensure that land acquisition and resettlement do not disadvantage women. \n \n27.  Document in each RP the extent to which the project design and alignment have avoided or \nminimized land acquisition and displacement of people and businesses. Include in the RPs village-\nlevel  impact  assessment  of  project-affected  people,  land,  assets,  and  occupations.  Identify \npotential impoverishment risks and vulnerable groups, including those severely affected through \nloss of land, those with low income, and others (e.g., the disabled, the elderly, ethnic minorities, \nunemployed, illiterate, women, children) and develop special mitigating measures, as required.  \n \n28.  Assess the policy and legal framework for resettlement, identify any gaps between ADB \nand PRC policies and propose measures to bridge the gap. In collaboration with the EA and local \ngovernment officials, define impact categories and compensation eligibility of affected people, and \nprepare an entitlements matrix covering compensation and other assistance for all types of impacts \nto achieve full replacement for lost assets, income, and livelihood systems. \n \n29.  Assist the EAs and expressway companies to prepare a public consultation and disclosure \nplan,  develop  a  format  for  documenting  consultation  with  affected  people,  and  initiate  a \nparticipatory process for RP preparation and implementation among affected communities, local \nleaders, proponents, and other stakeholders. Assist the EAs to prepare a resettlement information \nbooklet for distribution to all affected villages and households. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20050912141607+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20050831142053+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - BC_03Aug05_WB_text.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "E72", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
