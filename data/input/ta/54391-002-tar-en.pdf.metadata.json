Increasing  financial  and  non-financial solutions  targeting  gender  equality  can boost \neconomic growth, bolster well-being to all stakeholders, and create compelling opportunities for \ninvestment1. Evidence from recent research suggests  that promoting a business  culture that \ninvests in  women beyond social responsibility  standards  by incorporating a gender  lens in \nbusiness results in a double benefit through both improving the lives of women and girls and \ngenerating higher economic returns.2 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) \nworks to  benefit  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  clients  while  driving  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment in Asia and the Pacific in alignment with ADB Operational Plan for Priority 2 (OP2): \nAccelerating Progress in Gender Equality, 2019\u201320243. As such, providing guidance and capacity \nbuilding to clients to develop, administer and report on their gender action plans (GAPs), and thus \nensuring  satisfactory achievement of gender  results\u2019  is  a key element of PSOD\u2019s gender \nimplementation plan. \n \n3.  PSOD is starting to reap the fruits of its labor with increasing success in integrating gender \ninto its project processing. The three-year rolling average for PSOD projects for the years 2017 \nto 2019 was 13% of projects categorized as Gender Equity Theme and 16% categorized as \nEffective Gender Mainstreaming. A greater number of higher gender category projects means a \ncumulative increase in the number of Gender Action Plans (GAPs) requiring implementation by \nclients and monitoring by ADB. PSOD clients that have committed to gender measures under \ntheir GAPs may not always have at their disposal the full complement of capacities and resources \nnecessary to successfully deliver on the measures within the target timeframes. For example, \nchallenges may include, companies having basic information on the gender inequality in their \nworkforce along with the aspiration to address it but lacking the expertise on methodologies to \nattract and retain female talent; or companies unfamiliar with how to appropriately tackle sexual \nexploitation, abuse and harassment (SEAH) within their workplace. In some cases, clients may \nseek partnership with external organizations to complement their limited internal resources to \ndeliver. \n \n4.  The  proposed  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  Cluster  Subproject  to  Strengthen \nImplementation  of Gender  Mainstreaming  in  Nonsovereign  Investments  (hereafter the  TA \nSubproject) is designed to address gaps in PSOD client capacity and to support the delivery of \nquality gender development results. \n \nI.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n5.  This TA Subproject is being processed in parallel with the Technical Assistance for Gender \nMainstreaming and Gender Initiatives in Nonsovereign Operations Cluster proposal (TA Cluster), \nwhich preliminary comprises of five subprojects. The TA Cluster includes the following sub- \nprojects (i) support private sector projects categorized Effective Gender Mainstreaming or Gender \nEquity Theme under ADB categorization system in the implementation of their gender action \n \n1 Christie D.

", "2 \n \n \nplans; (ii) increase women\u2019s access to finance in the Pacific for women businesses through the \nWAVES Program; (iii) enhance gender mainstreaming in climate finance projects under the \nAustralian Climate Financing Partnership; (iv) develop knowledge and tools to promote gender- \nlens financing by financial institutions; and (v) enhance gender mainstreaming in venture capital \nfinancing operations. The TA Cluster specifies that the subprojects are not mutually dependent \nand may be presented and approved in any order. Not all these five subprojects may materialize \nand/or additional subprojects may be developed over the course of the TA Cluster. \n \nB.  Subproject Scope \n \n6.  The TA Subproject aims to assist PSOD clients in improving quality delivery of their gender \ndevelopment results and meeting their gender commitments reflected in the projects\u2019 GAPs. The \nfocus of the TA Subproject is to provide support in developing gender measures through corporate \ninitiatives and adapt business practices to become more gender inclusive. \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities \n \nOutput 1: Capacities of ADB PSOD clients are improved to provide more gender equitable \nbusiness offerings to their customers \n \n7.  The TA Subproject will seek to increase beneficiaries\u2019 understanding  of how gender \nmainstreaming applies to their business and will enhance their capacities to develop products that \nrespond to the female market, i.e. female service providers, female distributors, women-owned \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (WMSMEs) and female customers. The output deliverables \nare likely to include the development of new products and services targeting female markets and \nthe production of case studies, guidance or tip sheets to inform beneficiaries on good business \npractices. \n \n8.  Expected activities under Output 1 may include: \n\u2022  Capacity building of beneficiaries to develop specific communication /messaging and \ntargeted dissemination of information on specific products that can apply to WMSME \nbusinesses and/or female entrepreneurs; \n\u2022  Capacity building of beneficiaries to develop tools and provide (online or in-person) \ntraining  modules  or  capacity building  to  boost  knowledge  and  skills  of  female \nentrepreneurs and WMSMEs on business management; \n\u2022  Capacity building of beneficiaries to develop digital platforms to enable greater access \nto services and/or providing support in mitigating limitations on accessing technology \nand digital services that the female market may encounter; \n\u2022  Production of guidance notes for PSOD clients on legal, social and economic barriers \nfor women to access resources and market opportunities (per sector and country as \napplicable); and/or \n\u2022  Production of case studies  on business  offerings that take gender  equality  into \nconsideration. \n \nOutput 2: Abilities of ADB PSOD clients are strengthened to create more conducive work \nenvironment for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment \n \n9.  Under this output, the TA Subproject may support the beneficiaries in developing tools \nand corporate initiatives aimed at raising awareness, capacity building and addressing gender \nspecific issues that impact women\u2019s ability to work safely and productively, in view of promoting ", "3 \n \n \nequal  access  to  employment, career  development  and  leadership  participation.  Output  2 \ndeliverables  notably include the implementation by the TA beneficiaries of gender sensitive \nhuman resources (HR), Policies, professional  development programs targeting  female staff, \nproduction of training, communication material or good practice case studies, guidance or tip \nsheets. \n \n10.  Expected activities under Output 2 may include: \n\u2022  Advisory services to review and create a response plan in relation to the company\u2019s \npolicies on gender related matters, notably on equal pay and work conditions, work \narrangements and leave provisions; \n\u2022  Raising awareness of HR, management and other relevant teams on gender issues \nthat may be encountered at the workplace, as a result of the working environment or \nduring a crisis; 4 \n\u2022  Capacity building of HR and management teams in implementing the gender-related \npolicies (on SEAH or gender inclusivity), in providing adequate support to staff who \nare survivors of sexual abuse for example, and associated training modules for a \ncorporate audience. The TA may also support facilitating the actual assistance to staff \nand training for beneficiaries; \n\u2022  Capacity building of HR and management teams in elaborating and implementing \ntalent management programs that respond to their female staff\u2019s professional needs; \n\u2022  Production of training  modules  or communication tools  for internal  and external \naudiences on SEAH or on unconscious biases (e.g. stereotypes, roles, discrimination, \ninequalities); and/or \n\u2022  Production of guidance notes, tip sheets or case studies for PSOD clients on how to \nimplement HR practices on gender inclusive workplaces, such as on recruitment and \nretention of female talent or communicating on zero tolerance towards SEAH. \n \nOutput 3: ADB PSOD clients\u2019 capacity to implement and report on their gender measures \nand Gender Action Plans is enhanced \n \n11.  The TA Subproject will seek to enable beneficiaries to better implement, monitor and \nreport on the development results generated by their actions to promote gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s  empowerment. Deliverables  under  this  output  will  be  measured  in  terms of  the \napplication of gender responsive data collection, analysis and reporting by the TA beneficiaries, \nand delivery of periodic GAP progress reports of high quality and on-time. \n \n12.  Expected activities under Output 3 may include: \n\u2022  Capacity building of relevant implementation teams to assess, revise and apply sex- \ndisaggregation in data collection and analysis for their operations, and report on them \nin development effectiveness matrices and tools; \n\u2022  Capacity building of implementing teams to effectively understand monitoring and \nreporting on the measures identified in their GAPs for ADB projects; \n\u2022  Capacity building of relevant corporate team members to develop gender-integrated \nperformance reports and share good business practices or case studies  through \n \n \n4 This may also include ski, For example, to close an identified gender gap e.g., female entrepreneurs on business \nskills, male managers on how to support staff who are survivors of sexual abuse increased risk of maternal mortality \n(due to weaker healthcare services) or rise in domestic violence cases or sexual assaults are examples of gender \nissues more present during crisis. In addition to threatening women\u2019s rights and freedoms, these issues also have \nrepercussions on women\u2019s ability to work or earn a living. Including bringing attention to anti-sexual harassment and \nanti-human trafficking measures, as applicable.

Subproject Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA Subproject is estimated to cost USD 500,000, which will be financed on a grant- \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-income transfer).5 The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1. Given the regional  scope of the TA Subproject, respective \ngovernment's non-objection requests will be submitted for each TA Subproject intervention in line \nwith  ADB Operations  Manual and  in  particular  its  Technical  Assistance  and  No-Objection \nProcedure sections.6 \n \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The TA Subproject will  run for an initial  period of three years from January 2021 to \nDecember 2023. ADB\u2019s PSOD gender team, which is part of the Private Sector Transaction \nSupport division, will administer the TA and will recruit and manage the consultant individual/s or \ncompany/s to be engaged  to implement TA activities targeting the beneficiary clients. It is \nprovisioned that a TA Cluster Program Coordinator will oversee the tasks and deliverables of the \nconsultants recruited as part of this TA. The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n15.  The TA Subproject will operate in parallel to PSOD transactions and will target PSOD \nprojects classified as Gender Equity Theme and Effective Gender Mainstreaming as per ADB \nGender Categorization  System. The TA will deploy capacity building activities to companies \nincluding financial institutions (the beneficiaries) to improve their institutional ability to deliver their \nrespective gender measures and GAPs. The request for TA will be submitted by the client and \ntransmitted to the PSOD gender team. The TA Program Coordinator will be responsible  for \nassessing  the requests  against  the TA Cluster  output measures  and for preparing  the TA \nconsulting work plan to be approved by PSOD gender team (see Appendixes 2 for selection \ncriteria) on a quarterly basis. \n \nTable 1: Subproject Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  January 2021 \u2013 December 2025 \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nImplementing agencies  Private Sector Operations Department, Transaction Support Division \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nSelection method  Package title  $ (amount) \nIndividual selection  TA Program Coordinator  120 \nIndividual selection*  Gender Specialists in  365 \nwomen\u2019s economic \nempowerment, human \n \n5 This is the preliminary allocation for the first year of allocations.
