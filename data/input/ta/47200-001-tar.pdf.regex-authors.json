INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  improve  transparency  and  efficiency  in  public  financial \nmanagement.1 A TA fact-finding mission from 28 March to 4 April 2014 reached an agreement \nwith  the  government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost \nestimate and financing plan, and terms of reference for the TA consulting services. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Transparency in public financial management is necessary to make the government \nmore accountable, and to build trust with the citizens of Mongolia, while efficiency in public \nfinancial management is necessary to use limited public resources effectively. The keys to \ntransparent  and  efficient  public  financial  management  are  budget  planning  and  execution. \nInvestment  budget  planning  should  meet  short-term  local  needs  and  support  a  country\u2019s \nmedium-  to  long-term  development.  It  is  also  important  to  clearly  define  the  process  of \ninvestment budget execution, and to make the related information publicly available. Moreover, \na stable and efficient taxation system is a fundamental element of public financial management, \nand  needed  to  support  national  economic  development.  Taxation  systems  include  various \nelements such as taxpayer registration, tax and debt collection, verification, and accounting \nmanagement. Therefore, tax agencies seeking to establish an efficient taxation system must \nmanage administrative costs and make the system user friendly and enforceable. Transparency \nin taxation is also critical to strengthening taxpayer compliance and trust.  \n \n3.  The Government of Mongolia has made substantial efforts to improve transparency and \nefficiency in public financial management. To further support the government\u2019s initiative, key \nchallenges are to improve transparency and efficiency in (i) public investment budget planning \nand execution, and (ii) the taxation system. \n \nA.   Improve Transparency and Efficiency in Public Investment \n   \n4.  The Budget Law, enacted in 2002, has defined and regulated budget planning and its \nexecution  in  Mongolia.  It  was  further  amended  in  2011  to  improve  the  efficiency  and \npredictability  of  public  resource  allocation,  and  increase  transparency  in  public  financial \nmanagement. The following areas are included in its key regulations: (i) investment planning, \nfinancing, and monitoring; (ii) transparency in budgeting and accountability; and (iii) citizens \nparticipation in budgeting. As a step to implementing the amended Budget Law, the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) initiated establishment of a public investment information management and \nmonitoring platform to enhance transparency and efficiency in public investment through the use \nof information and communication technology (ICT).3  \n \n5.  This platform is intended to make relevant information and data publicly available, and \nmanage and supervise public investment. The platform will therefore include both a public \nmonitoring  portal  for  public  investment  (PMPPI)  and  a  public  investment  management \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan. ADB. 2014. County Operations Business Plan: \nMongolia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 October 2014. \n3  The public investment covers all investment budgets managed by the MOF, including the Local Development \nFund. \n ", "2      \n \ninformation system (PIMIS). The PMPPI will provide relevant data and information to the public, \nand is expected to enable citizens to monitor public investment planning and execution.4 The \nPIMIS is an ICT system designed to manage and supervise public investment.5  \n \n6.  The MOF is preparing physical facilities to establish the platform (e.g., constructing the \nnecessary ICT facilities). However, no assessment has been made of PMPPI and PIMIS quality \nor their readiness for full implementation. Moreover, MOF is critically behind in developing \nintegrated  system  management  to  support  PMPPI  and  PIMIS  functions  and  the  linkages \nbetween them. Quality integrated system management is critical to ensure the functions and \nsecurity of the platform.    \n \nB.   Electronic Taxation System \n \n7.  Improving  tax  administration  has  been  a  challenge  for  the  General  Department  of \nTaxation (GDT) in Mongolia. Electronic taxation (e-taxation) is a promising approach to improve \nefficiency and transparency in tax administration through appropriate ICT adoption. Successful \nelectronic  tax  administration  is  expected  to  increase  taxation  efficiency  by  reducing \nadministrative  costs,  enhancing  taxpayer  convenience,  and  increasing  tax  compliance. \nElectronic administration also strengthens transparency by standardizing taxation processes \nand procedures. An e-taxation system will address the administrative needs of the tax agency \nand the tax compliance requirements of taxpayers. Therefore, an e-taxation system needs to \nincorporate various taxation functions\u2014for taxpayer registration, return filing, and tax payment\u2014\nand be an interactive system that supports various users (e.g., taxpayers, tax agency staff, and \nstatutory auditors). Hence, establishing an e-taxation system will require substantial investment \nin ICT infrastructure, networks, and business process standardization. \n \n8.   The GDT began transitioning to an electronic system in the early 2000s. It has been \nworking to establish a tax information system to automate registration of taxpayers and tax \ntypes, tax accounting, tax payment, and the tax refund process. As of 2012, the e-taxation \nreturns accounted for about 77% of the total collected value-added tax, 20% of the income tax, \nand 15% of the withholding tax.6 The GDT has also been establishing an online data exchange \nsystem to link the taxation system with other government agencies.7 The GDT has made a \nsignificant  effort  to  develop  these  major  functions,  but  this  is  not  sufficient  to  establish  a \nfunctional e-taxation system, given such a system\u2019s complex nature. In particular, the quality of \nand linkages between the following four elements are essential for a functional system: (i) \nbusiness process and procedures; (ii) database management; (iii) ICT application software; and \n(iv) ICT infrastructure.  \n \n9.  Business processes and procedures related to tax administration (business architecture) \nare very complex, and the lack of a standard process is one of the most serious obstacles a tax \nagency  faces  when  it  adopts  ICT  to  its  taxation  system.  Therefore,  business  process \nstandardization  is  the  most  fundamental  element  of  an  e-taxation  system.  Database \nmanagement (data architecture) involves the design of a data structure to ensure consistency in \nand  manage  redundancy  of  all  related  data  in  the  system.  The  database  covers  various \ntaxation-related  data,  including  taxpayer  records,  tax  returns,  tax  accounting,  appeals  and \n                                                \n4  This portal will not be interactive (citizens will not enter data or information). \n5  This system will be interactive, and provide both information and transaction services for its main users\u2014\ncompanies that are implementing projects, ministries (implementing agencies), and the MOF (supervisor).  \n6  ADB. 2014. Promoting ICT in Mongolia: ADB Assistance Options. Manila. \n7  Tax Related Information Program Assistance, funded by the World Bank, helped the GDT establish the necessary \nICT system for data collection, taxpayer registration, and tax collection records. \n ", "3 \n \nobjections, and audit trails; it also holds the data that must be exchanged with other agencies \nsuch as banks and relevant ministries. Therefore, effective database management is essential \nfor a functional and efficient e-taxation system. ICT application software (application architecture) \nseeks to streamline taxation and compliance processes and ensure adequate internal controls, \nand  thus must  identify specific  software to  support  standardized  business  procedures  and \ndatabase management, and ensure the major taxation system functions are linked. Furthermore, \nICT infrastructure (technology architecture) is the base of the e-taxation system, which hosts the \napplication software, and must identify specific ICT technology that will support the needed \nnetwork, programming language, and risk management functions. To establish a functional e-\ntaxation system, the GDT needs to assess the quality and readiness of these core elements, \nwith integrated management that ensures those functions, the linkages between them, and \nsecured operations.  \n \n10.  The  Mongolia  Interim  Country  Partnership  Strategy,  2014\u20132016  identified  good \ngovernance as a thematic driver of change to support the effective use of public resources in \nMongolia.8 The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 emphasizes the importance of governance \nand institutional capacity in sustaining growth momentum and ensuring inclusive development.9 \nTransparency and efficiency in public financial management are underlying factors for good \ngovernance that have been critically lacking in Mongolia. Previous ADB support was provided to \nimprove public financial management in Mongolia through strengthening of accounting systems, \nrelevant regulations, and public auditing.10  \n \n11.  The proposed TA is a continuation of ADB support for strengthening public financial \nmanagement  in  Mongolia.  It  will  provide  further  assistance  to  the  government  to  improve \ntransparency and efficiency in public investment and taxation by using ICT. Specifically, it will \nsupport the MOF to establish a public investment information management and monitoring \nplatform, including the PMPPI and PIMIS, by focusing on their quality and readiness for full \nimplementation and an integrated system management analysis to ensure the platform is both \nfunctional and secure. The proposed TA will also support the GDT to establish an e-taxation \nsystem, with particular attention to the four major elements of a functional e-taxation system: \nbusiness processes and procedures, database management, ICT application software, and ICT \ninfrastructure. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The  impact  will  be  improved  transparency  and  efficiency  in  public  investment  and \ntaxation. The achievement will be measured by enhanced utilization of a public investment \ninformation management and monitoring platform, and an e-taxation system. The outcome will \nbe  improved  functionality  and  system  integration  of  the  public  investment  information \nmanagement and monitoring platform, and the e-taxation system.  \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.

The  proposed  TA  will  deliver  six  major  outputs  in  the  following  components:  (i) \ntransparency and efficiency in public investment and (ii) an e-taxation system. \n \n14.  The following outputs will be delivered to support transparency and efficiency in public \ninvestment:  \n(i)  A  policy  recommendation  (knowledge  product)  on  ensuring  the  respective \nfunctions  of  the  PMPPI  and  PIMIS,  and  establishing  integrated  system \nmanagement. \n(ii)  Capacity development for (a) relevant government officials and companies that \nimplement public investment projects in the proper operation and use of the \nPIMIS, and (b) MOF ICT personnel in the platform\u2019s maintenance and secured \noperation. \n(iii)  Enhanced public awareness and understanding of the issue of public investment \ntransparency and the function of the PMPPI, with development of a general users\u2019 \nguide. \n \n15.  The policy recommendation will be produced based on an analysis of integrated system \nmanagement that supports the respective functions of the PMPPI and PIMIS, and the linkage \nbetween those functions. The TA will also assess the quality and readiness of the PMPPI and \nPIMIS  for  full  implementation,  and  produce  a  system  management  manual  to  ensure  the \nplatform\u2019s  sustainable  operation.  Trial  platform  testing  will  be  also  supported,  and  an \nassessment of the platform\u2019s functionality with an action plan for full implementation will be \nincluded in the policy recommendation.  \n \n16.  The following outputs will be delivered to support an e-taxation system: \n(i)  Policy  recommendation  (a knowledge  product) for  technology  upgrading  and \nsystem integration for an e-taxation system. \n(ii)  Risk management system support for operation of tax administration. \n(iii)  Capacity development for relevant GDT officials and ICT personnel to sustain \nsecured operation of the e-taxation system with development of training materials, \nand increased public awareness of the e-taxation system. \n \n17.  The policy recommendation will be produced based on a diagnostic assessment of the \ncurrent ICT system for electronic tax administration with particular attention to (i) business \nprocesses  (business  architecture),  (ii)  database  management  (data  architecture),  (iii)  ICT \napplication  and  software  (application  architecture),  and  (iv)  ICT  infrastructure  (technology \narchitecture). The diagnostic assessment will focus on the quality and readiness of those four \ncore  elements,  and  the  linkage  of  those  elements  for  technology  upgrading  and  system \nintegration  for  a  functional  e-taxation  system.  Based  on  the  diagnostic  assessment,  an \ninvestment and action plan for full implementation of e-taxation system will be produced and \nincluded in the policy recommendation.  \n \n18.  To  support  the  risk  management  system,  taxation  workflow  management  will  be \nanalyzed, and associated risks and mitigation measures identified for secure tax administration. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,155,000, of which $1,100,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \n ", "5 \n \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  assistance  in \narranging meetings with relevant agencies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from November 2014 to November 2016. \nThe Fiscal Policy and Planning Department of the MOF is the executing agency. The Local \nDevelopment Fund Division is the implementing agency for component 1, and the GDT is for \ncomponent 2. \n \n21.  The TA will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem of consultants, as well as the costs \nof workshops, seminars, and miscellaneous expenses. Disbursements under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Two data servers will be procured under component 1. Procurement will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time).    \n \n22.  A  firm  will  be  recruited  for  both  components  respectively;  a  firm  will  provide  two \ninternational consultants and three national consultants for component 1, and another firm will \nprovide  three  international  consultants  and five  national  consultants for  component  2. The \npreferred selection method is quality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20, \nusing a simplified technical proposal. One individual consultant will be required to address \ncomponents 1 and 2. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for \nconsultants with deliverables linked to the design and monitoring framework are in Appendix 3. \nThe respective team leaders will develop a detailed work plan with the executing agency and \nthe implementing agencies at the outset of the TA, and will be responsible for coordinating with \nother consultants working on their respective components. The consultants will maintain close \nworking relations with the executing agency, the implementing agencies and ADB, and will \nregularly discuss project progress. \n \n23.  The executing agency and the implementing agencies will supervise the consultants\u2019 \nday-to-day work. The project outputs, including knowledge products, will be disseminated at \nworkshops and seminars. Workshops and seminars will be attended by government officials, \nprivate sector representatives, civil society members and specialists to ensure the inclusion of \ndiverse views and the wide dissemination of project outputs. The project-specific indicators and \ntargets in the design and monitoring framework, including outcome evaluation, will be monitored \nby the executing agency and the implementing agencies with ADB support. Policy dialogue will \nbe maintained with the relevant government agencies, and project-specific issues will be taken \nup  with  government  counterparts  during  review  missions.  Technical  milestones  will  be \nmonitored by reports to be prepared by the consultants and reviewed by the executing agency, \nthe  implementing  agencies,  and  the  ADB  project  officer.  Milestones  related  to  TA \nimplementation will be monitored by the team leader. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,100,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Transparency and Efficiency in \nPublic Financial Management, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved transparency and  By 2023, 50,000 instances of  Relevant official  The government will \nefficiency in public investment  public access to PMPPI  documents  continue to support \nand taxation  (measured by the number of  improving \nOperation of the \nvisits to a website), with at  transparency and \nplatform, including the \nleast 50% of public investment  efficiency in public \nPIMIS and PMPPI  \nprojects managed through the  financial \nPIMIS (Baseline 2014: 0)  Operation of e-taxation  management. \n  system \nRisks \nBy 2023, at least 50% of tax \npayers filed their tax payment  Needed equipment \nthrough the e-taxation system  will not be available \n(Baseline 2012: 20%)  for citizens to access \n  PMPPI and file their \ntax payment through \nthe e-taxation \nsystem. \nTax payers will not \nhave necessary skills \nto file their tax \npayment through the \ne-taxation system. \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved functionality and  By 2017, integration of PMPPI  Relevant official  Necessary ICT \nsystem integration of  the  and PIMIS completed  documents  experts are available \npublic investment information  (Baseline 2014: N/A)  to be hired in the \nTA completion report \nmanagement and monitoring    labor market. \nplatform, and the e-taxation  By 2017, integration of each \nRisk \nsystem  module under e-taxation \nExisting modules of \nsystem completed \ne-taxation system \n (Baseline 2014: N/A) \nare incompatible.  \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
