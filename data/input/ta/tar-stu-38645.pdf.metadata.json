The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nindependently evaluates the development effectiveness of ADB\u2019s operations. The operations \nevaluation program includes (i) assessing the performance of completed projects, programs, \nand  technical  assistance  (TA);  (ii)  reviewing  and  validating  self-evaluation  activities  of \noperational departments; (iii) providing feedback for the design and review of new operations, \nstrategies,  and  policies;  (iv)  monitoring  and  reporting  on  ADB\u2019s  and  executing  agencies\u2019 \nresponses to OED evaluation recommendations; (v) building evaluation capacity in developing \nmember countries (DMCs); and (vi) harmonizing evaluation practices and sharing evaluation \nexperience  with  other  multilateral  development  banks  (MDBs)  through  the  Evaluation \nCooperation  Group  (ECG).1  In  recent  years,  OED  has  increased  the  number  of  broad \nevaluations that assess impacts and lessons from groups of sector or country operations, or that \naddress institutional development issues, themes, approaches, or policies. OED is increasingly \ndisseminating its findings in printed form and on the Internet.  \n2.  On 1 January 2004, OED\u2019s independence and effectiveness were enhanced when it \nstarted  to  report  directly  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  through  the  Board\u2019s  Development \nEffectiveness Committee (DEC).2 OED independently selects completed projects, programs, \nand TAs for individual performance audit. In consultation with operational departments, topics \nfor broad evaluation studies are selected on the basis of upcoming work on new policies, \nstrategies,  programs,  and  projects  that  would  directly  benefit  from  the  evaluations.  DEC \nprovides overall guidance to OED. In 2004, DEC endorsed for the first time a 3-year rolling work \nprogram for OED, covering 2005\u20132007 (Appendix 1). The 2005 work program is fully specified; \nthe 2006\u20132007 work programs are provisional and flexible enough to respond to changes in \ninstitutional evaluation priorities. The 2005 slice of the program was presented to the Board in \nthe overall administrative budget of ADB for 20053 as the basis for Board approval of OED\u2019s \nbudget for 2005. \n \n3.  OED\u2019s  2005\u20132007  work  program  features  (i)  a  continuing  but  declining  number  of \nevaluations of randomly selected individual operations; (ii) an increase in broad evaluations in \nthe form of impact and special evaluation studies, country assistance program evaluations \n(CAPEs), sector assistance program evaluations (SAPEs), and evaluations of ADB policies and \noperational  approaches;  (iii)  continued  improvement  of  the  evaluative  content  of  the  OED \nannual reports on portfolio management and evaluation results; (iv) preparation or revision of \nevaluation guidelines; and (v) a sequencing of evaluations so that those done in the earlier part \nof the 3-year period feed or link into evaluations planned for the later years.  \n \n4.  OED\u2019s 2005 work program includes (i) 23 individual performance audits of completed \nADB-assisted operations (20 in the public sector, 3 in the private sector) and 4 TA performance \naudits; (ii) 10 broad evaluation studies that will begin in 2005 and be completed in 2006;  \n(iii)  several  other  recurring  outputs,  including  the  two  OED  annual  reports  to  the  Board;  \n(iv) evaluation of selected ongoing operations; and (v) updating of guidelines for evaluation of \n                                                 \n1  ADB chairs the ECG in 2005/06. Established in 1995, the ECG aimed to: (i) strengthen the use of evaluation for \ngreater effectiveness and accountability of MDBs; (ii) share and help disseminate lessons from MDB evaluations; \n(iii)  harmonize  performance  indicators,  evaluation  methodologies,  and  approaches;  (iv)  enhance  evaluation \nprofessionalism within MDBs and collaborate with the heads of evaluation units of bilateral and multilateral \ndevelopment organizations; and (v) facilitate the involvement of borrowing member countries in evaluation and \npromote their evaluation capacity. \n2  ADB. 2003.

The 10 broad evaluation studies in the 2005 OED work program (Appendix 1) will \nconsist of the following:  \n \n(i)  One impact evaluation study. Impact evaluation studies assess the results of a \ngroup of activities in a sector, or compare the results of similar activities in \ndifferent  DMCs.  They  emphasize  the  broad  institutional  and  development \noutcomes of ADB-assisted activities and combine impact evaluations of ADB \noperations and of ADB policies. \n(ii)  Two special evaluation studies. Such studies are undertaken on a wide range \nof topics, frequently operational approaches or strategic concerns of ADB.  \n(iii)  Three policy and procedure evaluations. These evaluations reassess ADB \npolicies and modalities in implementing the long-term strategic framework and \nreform agenda. \n(iv)  Two CAPEs. CAPEs assess the full range of ADB activities within a DMC over a \ndecade or more. They address issues relating to, and make recommendations \non, the focus of ADB activities in a DMC, including the sector mix and use of \nassistance modalities. CAPEs assess current country strategies and programs \n(CSPs) and are used as input to formulate new CSPs. Given the country focus of \nADB operations, country-level evaluations play a large role in evaluation. \n(v)  Two SAPEs. SAPEs assess the relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability of \nADB\u2019s assistance to a sector\u2019s development and financing, as well as the impact \nof such aid on economic development and poverty reduction in a DMC. \n \n6.  The 10 broad evaluation studies are complex, requiring consulting and other external \nservices and materials. These inputs are financed through regional TA. This resource allocation \nis included in the Technical Assistance Special Fund envelope in the President\u2019s operational \nresource parameters for 2005. In the context of these parameters, the external services and \nmaterials for 3 of the 10 studies could be covered through funds available from a previous \nregional TA approved for the same purpose.4 This proposed TA is required to fund the external \nservices  and  materials  for  the  remaining  seven  new  studies  as  well  as  dissemination \nenhancement and ECG-related activities. These outputs are described in the next section, \nwhich presents the TA proposal. \n \n7.  The  broad  evaluation  studies  will  require  a  longer  time  and  a  larger  budget  than \nevaluations of individual operations because they are significantly more complex.5 For the same \nreason, the seven studies are expected to be completed in 2006 rather than 2005, and require \nmore OED staff time to accomplish. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004. Proposed Technical Assistance for Selected Evaluation Studies for 2004. Manila (TA 6169-REG, for \n$1,400,000). \n5  A broad evaluation requires on average three times more resources than an evaluation of an individual operation. \n   ", "3 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  A design and monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 2.6 The goal of this TA is to \nhelp improve the development effectiveness of ADB operations and policies based on lessons \nand  recommendations  resulting  from  a  sound  evaluation  of  relevance,  efficacy,  efficiency, \nsustainability, and impacts. The purpose of the TA is to generate useful and practical lessons \nand recommendations that will support the formulation of new CSPs, sector strategies, policies, \nand projects. Performance targets and indicators are defined in the attached framework.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA\u2019s nine outputs and their respective scopes, approaches, and activities will be as \nfollows. \n \n10.  Impact  Evaluation  Study  on  the  Road  Sector  in  Indonesia.  Road  transport  is \ndominant  in  Indonesia,  carrying  92%  of  total  freight  transport  and  84%  of  passenger \nmovements. ADB\u2019s road sector strategy recognizes the need to balance service to resource-rich \nand  resource-poor  provinces,  to  decentralize  administration  to  local  governments,  and  to \nfinance road projects through innovative private and public partnerships. ADB lending has \nfocused on (i) improving the quality of the road network and (ii) strengthening the capacity of \ncentral and regional government agencies. The CSP for Indonesia7 covers 2003\u20132005, so a \nnew CSP is planned in 2006. An ongoing CAPE and the study will provide critical inputs to the \nnew CSP. The study will be designed to measure the development impact of ADB\u2019s activities to \ndate in the road sector and to make recommendations for road projects under the new CSP.  \n \n11.  Special  Evaluation  Study  on  Approaches  to  Local  Institutional  Capacity \nDevelopment in Water Resource and Rural Infrastructure Projects. Most of these projects \nhave capacity development components. However, the impact of capacity development on \nproject sustainability in these sectors has not been assessed in-depth. Capacity development \ncomprises activities that aim to improve the capabilities of DMC agencies to plan and design, \nimplement, and operate and maintain projects and programs. The study will focus on capacity to \noperate and maintain projects and programs as it is directly related to project sustainability. The \nstudy will further focus on local technical and financial capacity, which is key for successful and \nsustainable project performance. The evaluation results will be used in the ADB-wide review \nthat has been initiated on approaches to supporting capacity development in DMCs in general. \n \n12.  Special Evaluation Study on Involvement of Civil-Society Organizations (CSOs) in \nADB\u2019s  Social  Infrastructure  Operations.  Integrating  the  experience,  knowledge,  and \nexpertise of CSOs into ADB operations helps ensure that development interventions effectively \nserve  people\u2019s  priorities  and  needs.  In  its  operations  ADB  interacts  increasingly  with \ninternational, regional, and national CSOs, including nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \ntrade unions, indigenous peoples\u2019 movements, foundations, and faith-based organizations. ADB \ninteracts with CSOs that actively collaborate in operations as well as with policy advocacy \ngroups. ADB's policy, established in 1987 and broadened in 1998, mandates that ADB increase \nits cooperation with CSOs. A range of modalities for partnerships between ADB and CSOs has \nevolved, and new modalities for participation continue to be explored, particularly in the social \n                                                 \n6  The regional TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 19 December 2004. \n7  ADB. 2002. Country Strategy and Program (2003\u20132005): Indonesia. Manila. \n ", "4 \ninfrastructure sector. The study aims to (i) assess the scope of CSO involvement in ADB social \ninfrastructure operations, (ii) compare the effectiveness and assess the key success factors and \nlimitations of such CSO involvement, and (iii) identify key lessons for optimizing the impact of \nCSO involvement.  \n \n13.  Evaluation of the Effectiveness and Efficiency of TA Operations. In 2003, the Board \ndiscussed the R-paper that reviewed the management and effectiveness of TA operations8 and \napproved some changes to the current policy. Key issues were identified and, subsequently, an \naction plan was formulated and its implementation monitored during 2003\u20132004. More recently, \nan ADB-wide task force on TA reform has been set up to review the TA management structure \nand recommend options to allocate TA resources more strategically. After this initiative, OED \nwill carry out an independent evaluation to answer two basic questions: (i) How effective and \nefficient have TA interventions been over time? (ii) What conditions are necessary to make them \nefficient and effective? The study will compare poverty reduction impacts under ADB-financed \nprojects with and without related TA, and will link issues, lessons, and recommendations to \nADB\u2019s broad knowledge products and services program. \n \n14.  Evaluation of the Effectiveness of ADB\u2019s Partnering Approaches. ADB\u2019s formal \npartnership  policies  include  cofinancing,  cooperation  arrangement  with  international \norganizations and bilateral sources,9 promotion of cooperation with NGOs, and the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction. Essential to the CSP process is effective partnership with each DMC. \nGlobal  demand  for  much  greater  partnership  among  all  stakeholders  in  development  and \npoverty reduction has accelerated.10 In 2004, in dialogue with other MDBs, ADB launched the \nreform agenda, a major goal of which is to enhance the partnership framework with middle-\nincome countries and countries that use ordinary capital resources. An independent evaluation \nof the effectiveness of ADB\u2019s partnering approaches to date would be timely. The study will \nassess which partnership agreements and approaches have added more to ADB operations \nthan others, and recommend directions for further partnering. \n \n15.  Evaluation  of  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Sector  Strategy  and  Operations.  Cities  in  Asia  are \ngrowing rapidly. The pressure on urban and municipal infrastructure is increasing and many \ncities  are  suffering  from  poverty,  overcrowding,  and  environmental  problems.  In  2004,  the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department decided to review ADB\u2019s urban sector \nstrategy of 1999, and to update it to address important developments that it does not adequately \nreflect,  such  as  ADB\u2019s  adopting  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  and  joining  the  Cities \nAlliance  in  2002.  To  support  the  review,  OED  has  agreed  to  independently  evaluate  the \neffectiveness of implementation of the strategy. OED\u2019s evaluation will assess ADB urban sector \nprofiles, road maps, and projects in four countries (the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, \nPhilippines, and Thailand), as well as special institutional initiatives such as the Cities Alliance.11 \n16.  Sector Assistance Program Evaluation on the Transport Sector in the Central \nAsian Republics (CARs). Efficient, reliable, and safe transport is a condition for economic \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002. Review of the Management and Effectiveness of Technical Operations of the Asian Development \nBank. Manila. \n9  Under preparation at this writing. \n10 The Second High-Level Forum on Joint Progress toward Enhanced Aid Effectiveness held in Paris in March 2005 \ntook stock of progress in implementing the Rome Declaration on Harmonization. \n11 To enable the evaluation to start and to be in tandem with the review by RSDD, a small-scale TA for $150,000 was \napproved on 21 April 2005 (ADB. 2005. Small-Scale Technical Assistance for Special Evaluation Study on Urban \nSector Strategy and Operations. Manila [R-08/2005]). The balance required to complete the evaluation will be \nfunded through the proposed TA. \n   ", "5 \ngrowth of the CARs and for subregional cooperation. Roads and rail dominate the transport \nsector, but most networks are badly deteriorating as a result of poor construction and the lack of \nmaintenance, and reflect outdated traffic volume assumptions, especially on cross-border traffic. \nThe governments in Central Asia propose to improve the major highways, but financing remains \na major obstacle. Budget constraints are severe and private entities are reluctant to invest. The \npolicy environment, particularly for cross-border traffic, must be improved. ADB has helped \nrehabilitate  transport  through  lending  and  TA.  ADB  has  been  asked  to  cofinance  the \nrehabilitation of the highway linking Almaty in Kazakhstan with Bishkek in the Kyrgyz Republic, \nwhich could be a possible model for action. The SAPE will (i) assess the impact of ADB\u2019s \ncountry and subregional assistance on the sector\u2019s development and on poverty reduction;  \n(ii) identify lessons, especially for project preparation; and (iii) recommend key strategies for \nADB\u2019s country and subregional programs. \n17.  ECG Support Work. This consists of (i) ADB\u2019s term as the ECG chair, (ii) a public \nsector benchmarking study, and (iii) development of good-practice standards (GPS). The ECG \npromotes harmonization by developing GPS and undertaking benchmarking studies. This work \nis cofinanced by participating MDBs. In addition to such costs, the TA will finance some costs \nassociated with ADB\u2019s chairing of the ECG in 2005/06.  \n \n18.  Enhancing Dissemination of Lessons from OED Evaluations.  The  primary  output \nenvisioned is the development of a user-friendly evaluation site from which the database on \nlessons learned from OED evaluations can be readily accessed and searched by staff members \nand the public. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing of Inputs \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.25 million (Appendix 3). It will be financed by ADB on a \ngrant basis from its TA funding program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  OED will implement the TA and prepare an evaluation report as the output of each \nselected evaluation study. OED staff members will undertake the studies with the assistance of \ninternational and domestic consultants, who will be recruited individually. Altogether, about  \n37 person-months of international and about 65 person-months of domestic consulting inputs \nwill be required. The individual areas of expertise, duration of engagement of consultants, and \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. In keeping with OED\u2019s practice, a position paper \nfor each study outlining the detailed approach, methodology, and terms of reference will be \nprepared  before  engaging  consultants  and  commencing  the  studies.  Consultants  will  be \nengaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. Operational departments and \nDMC  governments  will  be  consulted  at  all  stages  of  formulation  and  implementation  and \ninvolved in discussion of results. The TA will commence in June 2005 and be completed by the \nend of 2006. Implementation arrangements will be flexible enough to allow changes in the \nscope should OED\u2019s work program need to be changed. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n21.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,250,000 on a grant basis for Selected Evaluation Studies for \n2005.\n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nEVALUATION WORK PROGRAM, 2005\u20132007 \n \nTable A1.1: 2005 Work Program \n \nCategory   Number \n         \nI.
