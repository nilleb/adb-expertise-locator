The Government of the Republic of the Philippines requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to provide advisory technical assistance (TA) for strengthening the Department of \nEnergy (DOE) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) for the development of the natural \ngas industry in the country. The Fact-Finding Mission, conducted from 22 May to 2 June \n2003,  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost \nestimates, financing, and implementation arrangements of the TA.1  The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  discovery  and  the  ensuing  development  of  the  Malampaya  gas  field,  offshore \nnorthwest of Palawan, gave birth to the Philippine natural gas industry. With reserves estimates \nranging from 2.26 trillion to 4.58 trillion cubic feet (TCF), the Malampaya gas field is currently \nsupplying gas to three power plants with overall capacity of 2,760 megawatts (MW) of power in \nBatangas, South Luzon, and will be able to provide fuel for another 1,000 MW capacity of power \nplants for at least the next 20 years. The additional demand for gas for power plants and other \nuses is planned to be met by new reserves to be proven, or by imported gas, either as liquefied \nnatural gas (LNG) in the medium term and/or through the Trans-ASEAN gas pipeline2 in the \nlong term.  \n \n3.  With the assistance of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Government \nhas developed a master plan study for developing the natural gas industry in the Philippines.3  \nOn the basis of a least-cost analysis of energy supply options and an assessment of the energy \ndemand,  the  study  prepared  a  comprehensive  medium-  and  long-term  master  plan  for \npromoting natural gas utilization in the Philippines, including an action plan to implement priority \nprojects  in  the  medium  term.  After  public  consultations  with  public  and  private  sector \nstakeholders, the Government approved the master plan. The Government is introducing policy \nmeasures and fiscal incentives to further promote the use of natural gas because it is consistent \nwith the country\u2019s economic sustainability objective and energy self-sufficiency program. It is \nnoted, in particular in line with the ongoing power sector reforms in the Philippines under the \nADB-supported Power Sector Restructuring Program,4 that it is critical to ensure the successful \nestablishment of the natural gas industry, to avoid the forecast power shortages in 2007-2008.   \n \n4.  Based on DOE\u2019s projections in consideration of competitive oil and coal prices, the \nnatural gas demand would increase annually from 93.7 billion cubic feet (BCF) in 2003 to 145.5 \nBCF by 2012. Demand in the power sector will account for the bulk of the total demand, with up \nto 4,200 MW additional capacity expected during the period. The demand for nonpower use \n(clustered industries near or along the gas pipeline) is also expected to grow from about 1.0 \nBCF  in  2005  to  16.0  BCF  in  2012.  Moreover,  with  ADB's  assistance,5 DOE  is  currently \nundertaking a study to develop a master plan for the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) in \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 May 2003.  \n2  A memorandum of understanding was signed by the energy ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) in July 2002 to develop the Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline Project, which includes seven gas \ninterconnections among ASEAN countries covering a total length of 4,500 kilometers. The total cost is estimated to \nbe $7 billion and completion is expected by 2020. \n3  DOE/JICA. 2002.

", "2 \npublic transport, including a pilot project phase, toward full commercialization of vehicles run by \nnatural gas. Based on the current and expected market conditions for the supply of natural gas, \nthe master plan established LNG imports as a feasible and economically viable option to meet \ngas demand in the Philippines in the medium term. Estimates of gas demand from the power \nsector indicate the need for imported LNG of about 23.2 BCF by 2008 to as much as 194.2 BCF \nby 2012. LNG may be imported from Australia, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, or Qatar depending \non market conditions. An efficient infrastructure system that will enable the Philippines to meet \nthe anticipated demand for natural gas will include the transmission, distribution, and city gas \npipelines; LNG terminals; CNG refilling stations; and related facilities. DOE has identified two \nmajor pipelines to be constructed in the next few years: (i) 100-kilometer (km) Batangas-Manila \npipeline and (ii) 150 km Bataan-Manila pipeline, and corresponding LNG receiving terminals.  \nAn innovative public-private sector partnership needs to be developed to realize the needed \ninvestment. Moreover, the prospect of large scale LNG imports calls for rationalization of fiscal \nincentives  to  promote  further  private  sector  investment  in  domestic  petroleum  and  gas \nexploration and production (E&P) activities.  \n \n5.  The Natural Gas Bill is currently being deliberated in Congress. Prior to the adoption of \nthe Bill, ADB assisted6 DOE to issue the interim rules and regulations (IRR) governing the \ntransmission, distribution, and supply of natural gas, which aim to promote competition by \nliberalizing entry into the industry and by adopting pro-competition and fair trade measures with \ndue regard to sustaining the financial viability of industry participants. The ERC, an independent \nregulator that the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) established in 2001 to succeed \nthe Energy Regulatory Board, in principle, has responsibility for the price regulation over the \nnatural gas industry. However, EPIRA did not explicitly define ERC\u2019s mandate in regulating the \nnatural  gas  sector.  Since  it  is  inappropriate  for  Government  to  carry  out  both  policy  and \nregulatory functions, a governance structure has to be established such that a clear distinction \nis drawn between the policy-making functions exercised by the Government and the regulatory \nfunctions that should be left to an independent energy regulator. It is necessary to assess \ngovernance to formulate relevant recommendations for streamlining the role of DOE and ERC in \nthe natural gas sector. \n \n6.   Development of the natural gas industry should be pursued with best international \ntechnical  practices,  international  safety  standards,  and  Philippine  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard policies. The technical and safety standards need to be clearly defined and issued by \nthe relevant authority to provide a clear and stable technical framework for private sector \ninvestors. Since development of natural gas infrastructure may have some implications for \nindigenous cultural communities, it is also necessary to strengthen DOE's capacity for screening \nand handling environmental and social safeguard concerns, specifically, for indigenous peoples.   \n \n7.  Consultation was held with various stakeholders. On the upstream side, the Government \nof Norway is providing TA to assess resources and to strengthen the technical capacity of DOE \nto administer its oil and gas exploration and development contracts. On the downstream side, \nthe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  has  contributed  to  the \npreparation  of  the  IRR  on  transmission,  distribution,  and  supply  of  natural  gas.  JICA  has \nsupported the preparation of the master plan study on the development of natural gas in the \nPhilippines (para. 3).  Building on the work carried out the previous TAs provided by ADB, \nUSAID, and JICA, this TA seeks to strengthen DOE\u2019s institutional capacity to implement the IRR \nand the master plan study so as to promote public-private sector partnership in developing the  \nnatural gas industry, particularly the downstream gas infrastructure in the Philippines. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1997.Technical Assistance to the Philippines for Gas Sector Policy and Regulatory Framework.

The TA aims to strengthen DOE\u2019s institutional capacity to implement the master plan on \nthe development of the natural gas industry through public-private partnership. The TA will \nmake  recommendations  for  streamlining  DOE\u2019s  planning  and  policy-making  functions,  and \nERC\u2019s regulatory functions in developing the natural gas industry efficiently. Introduction of \ntechnical and safety standards as well as compliance with environmental and social safeguard \npolicies in the Philippines will ensure the sustainable development of the natural gas industry. \n \n9.  The TA will have three main components: (i) develop planning and policy tools for \nadministering and regulating the natural gas industry, (ii) develop needed standards for the \ndownstream  areas  of  the  natural  gas  industry,  and  (iii)  transfer  technology  by  providing \neconomic, financial, and technical training to DOE and ERC staff. The TA will also identify areas \nthat require further assistance from development financing institutions in the medium term. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will adopt a participatory approach where DOE staff will be directly involved in a \nhands-on manner, to build core competency and establish the necessary tools that will aid in \nadministering  and  implementing  activities  for  downstream  development  of  the  natural  gas \nsector. The ERC staff will also be trained in carrying out regulatory functions effectively. \n \n 11.  To develop the planning and policy tools for administering and regulating the natural gas \nindustry, the TA will have the following key activities. \n \n(i)  Analyze the legal and regulatory environment and formulate recommendations to \nclarify ERC\u2019s regulatory function and DOE\u2019s policy-making role in the natural gas \nsector. \n(ii)  Undertake institutional analysis and formulate recommendations to strengthen \nDOE\u2019s natural gas office to perform its policy making mandate, including the \npromotion of private sector investment in downstream infrastructure in the natural \ngas sector. \n(iii)  Propose  an  integrated  planning  methodology  for  the  natural  gas  sector  that \nincludes (a) reviewing the overall energy sector framework including legislation, \nregulation and contractual arrangements; (b) developing relevant base case for \nnatural gas, covering exploration, development, production, and utilization; and \n(c) formulating/adopting appropriate fiscal incentives to promote private sector \ninvestment in petroleum and gas E&P activities. \n(iv)  Review the demand forecasts of natural gas in the country and recommend \nmeasures that will promote efficient use of natural gas. \n(v)  Formulate  recommendations  on  modalities  of  public-private  partnership  to \ndevelop the necessary downstream natural gas infrastructure in the medium \nterm. \n(vi)  Review  the  existing  assessment  of  medium-term  investment  requirements, \nidentify  areas  that  require  further  assistance  from  development  financing \ninstitutions, and prepare an assistance plan for the natural gas sector. ", "4 \n(vii)  Organize workshops, conferences, consultations, and road shows to promote \ninvestment opportunities in the downstream areas of the natural gas sector in the \nPhilippines.    \n \n12.  To develop the needed technical standards for downstream projects in the natural gas \nsector, the TA will include the following key activities. \n \n(i)  Prepare  an  inventory  of  international  technical,  safety,  and  environmental \nstandards which could be applied for downstream infrastructure for the natural \ngas  sector  (including  pipelines,  LNG  terminals,  natural  gas  vehicles,  CNG \nrefueling stations, cylinders, ancillary equipment, and other related facilities) in \nthe Philippines. \n(ii)  Develop  technical,  safety,  and  environmental  standards  for  downstream  gas \ninfrastructure. \n(iii)  Promote the use of natural gas in ecozones7 and develop manuals for evaluating \ntechnologies  (cogeneration  technologies,  as  well  as  heating  and  cooling \nsystems) with respect to technical performance, environmental impact, and social \nand economic viability. \n(iv)  Recommend  strengthening  of  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies, \nspecifically for indigenous peoples, due to the projected rapid growth of gas \nindustry. \n  \n13.  For technology transfer, the TA will include the following key activities. \n \n(i)  Assess the training needs of DOE and ERC. \n(ii)  Recommend  integrated  (upstream  and  downstream  infrastructure)  planning \nmethodology for natural gas (e.g., pipeline, LNG terminals, natural gas vehicles, \nCNG  refueling  stations,  ancillary  equipment,  other  related  facilities,  markets \nrouting, etc.), and on-the-job training. \n(iii)  Recommend best international practices for evaluating applications for permits \nfor using natural gas-related infrastructure facilities based on defined criteria \n(economics,  market  demand,  existing  capacity,  upstream  and  downstream \ncapacity, eminent domain, etc.). \n(iv)  Arrange a study tour for DOE and ERC officials to selected developing and \ndeveloped countries that have successfully experienced the E&P of natural gas \nresources, administered and regulated the gas sector.  \n(v)  Conduct training courses on evaluating technologies for E&P of natural gas, and \nnatural  gas  use  in  industrial  ecozones  covering  technical,  economic,  and \nenvironmental aspects. \n(vi)  Conduct training courses on economic and financial assessment of natural gas- \nrelated projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.15 million equivalent, comprising foreign \nexchange of $716,000 and local currency of $434,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $800,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis through the Japan Special Fund to finance the entire foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $84,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.
