INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  country  program  consultations  (March  2007),  the  Government  of  the \nPhilippines requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to prepare a comprehensive \nupland  development  program  in  tandem  with  possible  support  for  the  third  phase  of  the \nCordillera Highland Agricultural Resource Management Project (CHARMP2) recently approved \nby the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).1 In subsequent discussions with \nthe  Government,  ADB  was  requested  to  prepare  a  framework  which  would  help  prioritize \ninvestments in watersheds of national importance in all regions of the Philippines. The Fact-\nFinding Mission for the technical assistance to prepare the Integrated Natural Resources and \nEnvironmental Management (INREM) Sector Development Program was fielded in February \n2008 to develop the scope of work and implementation arrangements with the Government. A \ndesign and monitoring framework for the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is in \nAppendix 1 and initial poverty and social analysis in Appendix 2.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Watersheds  Degradation  and  Poverty.    Watersheds,  which  constitute  a  large \nproportion of the total land base of the Philippines, provide vital resources for the well-being of \nthe society. Most watersheds are located on mountainous and steep slopes, with 16.3 million \nhectares (ha) on slopes over 18% (upland), and 68% of this upland area is on slopes of more \nthan 30%. These watersheds are also a source of livelihood for rural communities. Degradation \nof these watersheds, especially in the uplands, which constitute the bulk of these resources, is a \nsignificant contributor to poverty, inequality, and loss of livelihood. About 18 million of the \npoorest of the poor upland farmer households, mainly indigenous people and landless peasants, \ndepend  on  marginal  hilly  uplands  for  their  livelihood;  subsistence  farming,  a  mixture  of \nagriculture, forestry, and fishing is the main source of their livelihood. Unsustainable land use \npractices leading to accelerated erosion and watershed degradation adversely impact the life \nand  well-being  of  these  poor  communities,  rendering  them  poorer  and  more  vulnerable  to \nclimatic extremes associated with such degradation. Poverty incidence in the Philippines, which \nis largely a rural phenomenon, varies widely among regions. The poverty incidence in all regions \nin Mindanao is higher than the national average. The poorest is the Autonomous Region of \nMuslim Mindanao (ARMM) with a poverty incidence of 55.3%. In contrast, Luzon has a poverty \nincidence of 20% with intraregional differences as in the Cordillera Autonomous Region (CAR) \nwhere  the  incidence  is  28.8%.  Both  Mindanao  and  CAR  have  the  largest  populations  of \nindigenous people. The present trend of increasing food prices is expected to further erode the \npurchasing power of the poor and is already leading to competing demands on arable land. This \nfurther  underscores  the  need  to sustainably expand  the  productive  capacity  of  the  natural \nresource assets that provide livelihood and food to the rural communities.      \n \n3.  Watershed Integrity and Climate Change. Slash and burn farming, forest fires, illegal \nlogging, deforestation, and illegal mining concessions within proclaimed watersheds contribute \nto  severe  degradation  of  watersheds,  adversely  impacting  their  ecological  functions,  and \ncompromising their integrity. Deforestation alone has contributed to accelerated soil erosion with \n                                                 \n1  Earlier, ADB and IFAD have cofinanced the Highland Agriculture Development Project in 1987-1993 and the \nCordillera Highland Agricultural Resource Management Project (CHARMP) in 1997-2004. IFAD has now asked \nADB to cofinance CHARMP2 approved by IFAD in April 2008. At a high-level meeting held in Manila in April 2008, \nADB reiterated its commitment to allocate $10 million for CHARMP2 from the ensuing loan expected to result \nfollowing the proposed PPTA (Integrated Natural Resources and Environmental Management Sector Development \nProgram), subject to the preparation of the Program in agreement with the Government and consideration by the \nADB Board. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 March 2008. \n ", "2   \n \nan estimated soil loss between 74 million and 81 million tons per year, and affecting about 77% \nof the country. Consequently, the storage capacity of the reservoirs and the dry season served \narea of irrigation systems is reduced directly contributing to reduced agricultural production. \nSilting of rivers and lake systems has shortened the life-span of reservoirs and dams affecting \npower generation. Furthermore, the loss of forest coupled with the expansion of economic \nactivities results in positive net emission of greenhouse gases. \n \n4.  The Philippines, being an archipelagic country with a prevailing tropical climate remains  \nhighly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The effects of climate change on agriculture, \nforestry and water resources will further encumber a country already reeling from a host of \nsocioeconomic and environmental problems. In the uplands, predictions indicate that changes in \nrainfall pattern may increase the rate of conversion of forests to agricultural lands due to human \nmigration from areas degraded by drought and erosion to more productive forest lands. A \ndecrease  in  soil  moisture  in  drier  areas  may  accelerate  forest  loss  while  an  increase  in \nprecipitation beyond evaporation demand could increase runoff resulting in soil erosion and \nflood occurrences. Adaptation to climate change impacts would mitigate potentially adverse \nimpacts on food production and associated adverse environmental impacts. \n \n5.  Inadequacy  of  Support  to  Decentralized  Environment  and  Natural  Resource \nManagement in Watersheds. Effective functioning of local government units (LGUs) at the \ndecentralized levels of administration have been constrained due to institutional fragmentation \nand funding limitation.  Unless the appropriations and qualified personnel for the devolved \nfunctions are transferred to the LGUs, there remain limited incentives for the LGUs to accord \ndue  priority  to  effective  management  of  natural  resources  in  the  watersheds  under  their \njurisdictions. Furthermore, no incentives are being provided to LGUs to invest in environmentally \nrewarding interventions in watershed management under a fiscally decentralized framework, a \nconstraint that must be addressed for sustaining the integrity of the watersheds. \n \n6.  Multiplicity  of  Institutions  and  Ineffective  Policies.  Despite  the  Government\u2019s \ndemonstrated commitment to environmental protection and natural resource management in the \nform of legal and regulatory instruments, the problem of watershed degradation continues to \nexacerbate.  Lack  of  institutional  integration  in  planning  and  management  is  a  continuing \nconstraint  in  instituting  a  financially  sustainable  decentralized  regime  of  integrated  natural \nresource management for the watersheds that, by their very nature, are multi-sector. A weak \ninstitutional  framework  has  resulted  in  fragmented  approaches  to  watershed  management. \nRegulations pertaining to watershed management are scattered in several policy issuances and \nadministrative  orders.  In  addition,  several  laws  intended  to  prevent  further  degradation  of \nwatersheds have been enacted but they fail to address the key areas of watershed management \nsuch as (i) conflicting land uses and practices within watershed areas, (ii) inappropriate land \nclassification  and  disposition  of  watershed  areas;  (iii)  continued  encroachment  and  illegal \noccupancy; and (iv) lack of economic incentives for watershed protection by the LGUs. \n \n7.  Experiences and Lessons. Several interventions by the Government on its own and \nwith  development  partner  assistance  have  resulted  in  the  design and  implementation  of a \nnumber of projects, programs, and strategies. In this context, IFAD\u2019s evaluation of CHARMP \nand the recommendations that have been integrated in the design of CHARMP2 are particularly \nrelevant to INREM, and include  (i) improving internal capacity for implementers rather than \nreplacing  it;  (ii)  focusing  local  implementation  needs  at  the  municipal  level,  with  greater \nemphasis on strengthening engagement of the LGUs and community groups; (iii) exploring \nopportunities for innovation through agricultural research by improved focus on applied research \nand replication processes; and (iv) further developing the level of environmental best practices \n ", "3 \nby continuing work on valuing environmental services, improving environmental assessment for \ninfrastructure construction, and strengthening the link between sustainable agriculture and forest \nmanagement. Lessons from other upland interventions include (i) detailed sector analysis prior \nto project design for identifying appropriate modalities for effective implementation; (ii) national \nagencies and LGUs can be effective, equal partners in achieving national goals under well-\ndefined  roles  and  constructive  partnerships;  (iii)  adoption  and  implementation  of  joint  and \ncomplementary initiatives by government agencies to harmonize programs; (iv) participatory \nprocesses reduces politicization of project activities, increases stakeholders\u2019 confidence, and \npromotes transparency and accountability; (v) the needs, situation and resource use patterns of \nindigenous people, which are different from lowlanders and upland migrants, should be studied \nseparately  so  that  approaches  more  suitable  to  a  particular  group  can  be  formulated;  (vi) \ninterventions to support agricultural productivity needs to be compatible with the principles of \nsustainable natural resource management; (vii) economic incentives for watershed protection \nneed to be institutionalized; and (viii) projects and programs attempting to address multi-sector \nproblems  through  single-sector  interventions  using  multiple  institutions  without  adequate \nattention  to  the  institutional  integration,  and  cohesive  and  concerted  implementation  in  an \nenabling policy environment are unlikely to succeed.  \n \n8.  IFAD is launching CHARMP2, following successful completion of CHARMP. Interventions \nunder  CHARMP2,  which  covers  all  six  provinces  of  the  CAR,  include  a)  social  mobilization, \nparticipatory  planning  and  land  titling;  b)  community  watershed  management,  reforestation  and \nagroforestry;  c)  agricultural  services,  value  chain  development  and  micro-finance;  and  d)  rural \ninfrastructure.  Being implemented in highland areas, these interventions are directly relevant to \neffective and sustainable management of watersheds in CAR and will provide valuable lessons for \ndesign  and  implementation  of  INREM  in  similar  watersheds  in  other  regions.  In  line  with  the \nagreement with the Government, policy and design parameters enshrined under CHARMP2 and \nthose being pursued by other development partners, such as the World Bank-assisted National \nProgram Support to Environment and Natural Resource Management Program, need to be \ncarefully assessed to ensure sector-wide complementarity in further developing a robust policy \nand institutional framework required to promote an integrated approach to environment and \nnatural resource management. This requires a detailed sector review and policy analysis as the \nbasis for an investment framework to address the challenges facing watershed management. A \nsector development program approach, which provides a long-term policy improvement and an \ninvestment framework to address such challenges, appears to be the most plausible approach.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  TA  will  be  adoption  of  financially  sustainable  and \nenvironmentally sound investment practices for management of watersheds. The outcome of the \nTA will be an agreed design of an investment proposal through a sector development program \nmodality for priority watersheds.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  PPTA  will  adopt  a  phased  sequential  approach  starting  phase  I  with  a \ncomprehensive  sector  analysis  and  an  assessment  of  experience  and  lessons  to  better \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nunderstand  the  issues,  constraints  and  opportunities  that  have  not  been  appropriately \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \naddressed. This will lead to the preparation of the strategy and investment program. Phase II will \ninclude preparation of a feasibility study for a possible SDP endorsed by all stakeholders, using \nwatershed as the management unit. A summary of key activities follows. \n ", "4   \n \n \n11.  Phase  I.  Key  activities  include  (i)  sector  analysis  and  other  associated  analyses \nincluding  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  existing  policies  and  legislation,  assessment  of \norganizational capacities and desire for institutional change, and identification of criteria for \nprioritization; (ii) stakeholder identification and workshops at various levels to obtain feedback; \n(iii) preparation of a draft strategy and investment program including its strategic environmental \nassessment, climate change implications, associated adaptation measures, and national food \nrequirements;  and  (iv)  finalization  of  the  strategy  and  the  investment  program,  taking \nstakeholder response into account, for priority watersheds in selected river basins. \n \n12.  Phase II. The feasibility study for an SDP under the strategy\u2019s investment program will \ncomprise an investment proposal and a policy reform agenda. Key activities include (i) collecting \nand analyzing of information for preparing reports for (a) detailed design for an SDP for INREM \nof priority watersheds; (b) poverty and social assessment, and poverty reduction strategy; (c) \nexternal assistance and lessons; (d) environmental assessment encompassing potential climate \nchange implications, adaptation measures and national food requirements, and assessment of \nthe  environmental  implications  of  the  policy  reform  agenda;  (e)  indigenous  peoples\u2019 \ndevelopment plan (if applicable); (f) involuntary resettlement plan (if applicable); (g) institutional \nassessment and capacity building plan; (h) cost estimates; (i) financing options; (j) economic \nand financial analysis; (k) gender action plan; (l) procurement plan; and (m) terms of reference  \n(TOR) for consulting services; (ii) preparing a policy reform agenda; (iii) conducting stakeholder \nworkshops to present the SDP; and (iv) preparing a final feasibility study. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1.15 million equivalent. ADB will provide \n$850,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government \nof Japan.3  The Government, through the concerned agencies, will provide in-kind contributions \nto the value of $300,000. The detailed cost estimates and proposed financing plan are in \nAppendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the PPTA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing program.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) will be the Executing \nAgency  for  the  PPTA.  The  National  Convergence  Steering  Committee  will  monitor \nimplementation progress. A technical working group, coordinated by DENR and comprising \nparticipating agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Agrarian Reform, \nNational Irrigation Administration and National Commission on Indigenous People, will provide \ntechnical  guidance  and  support  during  implementation.  To  ensure  coordination  with  all \ndevelopment  partners  and  relevant  stakeholders,  ADB  and  DENR  will  dedicate  staff  and \nconsultancy resources through an appropriate secretariat to facilitate consultations with the \ndevelopment partners and nongovernment organizations.    \n \n15.  Implementation will be carried out in two phases: Phase I will last for about 4.5 months \n(August\u2013November 2008) and culminate with the preparation of the strategy and the investment \nprogram. Stakeholder workshops will be held during various stages of implementation to discuss \nand agree on the strategy, program, and scope of the SDP. Phase II, expected to last for about \n                                                 \n3 Application for project development funding will be made to the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The TA is \nexpected to be co-financed by GEF on  a grant basis to support detailed studies for specific  GEF-eligible \ninterventions in selected sites including climate change impacts and adaptation measures. \n ", "5 \n4.5 months (December 2008\u2013April 2009), will result in the preparation of the SDP feasibility \nstudy. During the interim, following the conclusion of phase I and prior to initiation of phase II, an \nopen forum of concerned development partners will be organized where the approved strategy \nand  the  investment  program  will  be  presented,  and  the  development  partners  invited  to \nparticipate in the implementation of the investment program. Also, during this period, a decision \nwill be made regarding adoption of the SDP modality, and accordingly, the work program for \nphase II will be refined, and the TOR and implementation plan updated taking account of the \nfinal outcome of phase I and agreed scope of SDP. Progress and performance will be monitored \nby design and implementation of a project management information system.  \n \n16.  The  two  phases  of  implementation  will  require  an  estimated  27  person-months  of \ninternational consulting and 46 person-months of national consulting. Given the broad focus of \nphase I, flexibility will be required for undertaking a range of tasks to enhance engagement with \nthe stakeholders and prepare a stakeholder responsive strategy and investment program. Key \nexperts will therefore be engaged on an individual basis following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). An international consultant with expertise \nin integrated natural resources and environmental management will be engaged as the team \nleader (resource person) for phase I. In addition, international and national expertise will be \nrequired  in  policies  and  institutions,  social  and  poverty  development,  public  participation, \nstrategic environmental assessment, and land use planning and management.  For phase II, a \nconsulting firm will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time) following the quality- and cost-based selection procedure \n(technical and cost ratio of 80:20). While the level of effort of consultants may change in phase \nII, depending on the outcome of phase I, the international and national expertise required is \nanticipated to comprise economics and finance, policies and institutions, social and poverty \ndevelopment,  land  use  planning  and  management,  geographic  information  systems  and \nmapping, upland agriculture, and environmental safeguards.  Procurement will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended).  Upon  completion, \nequipment will be handed over to DENR.  \n \n17.  To provide continued leadership in adjusting the TOR following stakeholders\u2019 agreement \non the scope of phase I, provide continuity in design, and ensure the updated scope of work \nfinalized in the phase I is adhered to and the final output is fully responsive to the requirements \nof the feasibility study and objectives of the PPTA, the phase I team leader will be retained as an \nadvisor for phase II. The consultants\u2019 TOR are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Philippines  for  preparing  the  Integrated  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironmental Management Sector Development Program, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.  \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and/or \nPerformance Targets  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Reporting \nand/or Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact         Assumptions \nAdoption of financially  \u2022  Completion of the  \u2022  Appropriate annual  \u2022 Government \nsustainable and  Sector Development  budgetary  demonstrates its \nenvironmentally sound  Program by 2015  appropriations, and  willingness to adopt  \ninvestment practices for  \u2022  Appropriate INREM  Government  INREM \nintegrated natural  strategies and  approved policy  \u2022 Government continues \nresources and  policies adopted for  guidelines  its program on poverty \nenvironmental  all watersheds across  \u2022  Executive  reduction and \nmanagement (INREM)  the country by 2013.

POVERTY ISSUES \n \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nThe Philippine country sector and theme road map clearly convey the intention of the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  continue  concentrating  on  agriculture,  environment,  natural  resources,  and  rural \ndevelopment as priority development sectors. This reflects the four thematic constraints that impede rapid \npoverty  reduction  in  the  Philippines  as  identified  in  the  2005-2007  country  strategy  and  program: \ngeographic inequalities, inadequate infrastructure, poor management of assets and resources, and low \ninstitutional capacity. The proposed sector development program (SDP) will respond to these constraints \nthrough its geographic and demographic focus and components. Its geographic focus is on priority \nwatersheds within selected river basins within the poorest regions of the Philippines, which are home to a \nlarge rural population and where poverty is high. The percentage and number of poor people living in \nrural  areas  are  about  twice  that  of  urban  areas.  Those  living  in  the  upstream  and  midstream  of \nwatersheds are even poorer than those downstream. In the upstream and midstream areas, indigenous \npeople are poorer than the migrants but their socioeconomic conditions are interlinked. For the SDP to \nreduce the poverty of one group, it must include both as its demographic focus. The SDP is expected to \ncover selected watersheds in Luzon and Visayas, with its greatest emphasis in the Mindanao region, \nwhich lags the two geographic regions in all development indicators. The Mindanao region is a special \nfocus area of ADB and the Government; the SDP is part of the effort to put it on equal footing with rest of \nthe country after long years of conflict and neglect.    \n \nThe SDP will provide a more systematic and rational approach to poverty reduction and environmental \nrehabilitation in the priority watersheds through three levels of effort. The first is the formulation of a \nstrategy  and  a  phased  investment  program  for  integrated  natural  resources  and  environmental \nmanagement (INREM) of watersheds, using a watershed based approach in the selected river basins. \nThrough this strategy and investment program, experienced-based interventions for natural resource \nconservation, rehabilitation, and management will be prepared for priority watersheds in selected river \nbasins (watersheds will be prioritized based on stakeholders\u2019 agreed criteria and resource availability) \nand coherence in interventions will be attained. Second, INREM plans will be developed for priority \nwatersheds  in  selected  river  basins.  The  plans  will  define  site-specific  interventions  given  existing \nconditions, needs, inputs, and institutional and financial requirements. Third, investment packages will be \nprepared from among the watershed interventions identified under the INREM. These packages may \ninclude small-scale infrastructure, land tenure provision, targeted resource management interventions, \nand strengthening of policies and institutions. Small-scale infrastructure such as farm-to-market roads, \ncommunal irrigation systems, and foot bridges are needed to raise productivity by improving farm input \nquality and increasing market links. More secure tenure through ancestral domain titling for indigenous \npeoples and stewardship certification for upland migrants will increase their ownership of land and \nmitigate  open  access.  Resource  management  interventions  revolve  around  quality  market  access \nimprovement, demand-driven applied research, and sustainable financing development for conservation.  \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \n \n \nB.     Targeting Classification    \n       \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);   Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income \nMDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n2.   Basis for the classification: The SDP is expected to cover geographic areas with higher incidence of \npoverty than the national average. The possible inclusion of areas in Mindanao is likely to respond to \nthe priorities in the country strategy and program and the Medium Term Philippines Development \nPlan (2004-2010). The 2006 provincial poverty measures highlight regional income disparities in the \ncountry in 2006 given that 6 out of 10 poorest provinces were in Mindanao. The SDP components aim \nto address the constraints responsible for rural poverty and their link to environmental degradation in \na comprehensive and integrated manner.                                                                            \n \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is \nneeded? Not Applicable  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? The Asian Development Bank will provide \n$850,000 from the Japan Special Fund and the Government will provide $300,000 equivalent as in-\nkind support. In addition, sufficient emphasis is placed on analyzing issues directly relevant to \nresource poor and marginalized communities including land tenure and access to markets and \nservices by the upland poor.   \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, \npro-poor governance, and pro-poor growth)? The design is geared to improve the lives of the rural \npoor particularly those in the upstream and midstream portions of priority watersheds. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \n \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded \nbenefit from the project? The rural population in priority watersheds whose poverty will worsen under \nthe downward spiral of environmental quality will benefit. These include indigenous people and upland \nmigrants who are among the poorest and long excluded from lowland and urban-biased development \ninvestments.   \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? Comprehensive and \nintegrated  management  of  watershed  areas;  improvement  of  security  of  tenure  over  natural \nresources; access to markets, capital and services; sustainable management of  the resource base; \nand the responsiveness of policies and institutions to their poverty reduction and environmental \nmanagement requirements.   \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the \nproject address them? The gaps in government plans and resources as well as in the capacity of \nvarious stakeholder groups to produce the proposed benefits and services will be filled by the SDP by \nproviding financing, technical assistance, and management guidance. \n \n ", "Appendix 2  13\n \n \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.   Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. (i) National government agencies including Department of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources, Department of Agrarian Reform,  National Commission on \nIndigenous People, and Department of Agriculture; local government units with jurisdiction over \ncritical watersheds; (ii) users of upland resources such as water for domestic, commercial and \nagricultural  purposes;  timber;  non-timber  forest  products;  hydro  and  geothermal  power;    and \nagricultural produce; (iii) corporations (e.g., plantation, mining and hydropower operators) and small \nand  medium  scale  enterprises  dependent  on  watershed  products  (e.g.,  wood  processors  and \nconstruction aggregates extractors); (iv) community-based organizations; indigenous peoples groups; \nupland migrants; and nongovernment organizations.       \n \n2.   What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing \n(e.g.,  workshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  non-government  organizations  and \ncommunity-based  organizations,  etc.)?  National  stakeholder  consultation  workshops  will  set  the \ncriteria, prioritize critical watersheds, and key issues to be addressed. Stakeholder analysis will be \ncarried out in selected watersheds; the results will provide a basis for on-site consultations. The \nissues identified in the national level consultation will be validated in a stakeholder workshop in \nselected watersheds and actions taken will be drawn upon to guide the preparation of investment \npackages.    \n \n3.    What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n \n           Information sharing          Consultation      Collaborative decision making      Empowerment \n4.   Will a C&P plan be prepared?   Yes     No   The consultation and participation plan will be \nprepared based on the result of the stakeholder analysis and capacity assessment. The social \ndevelopment specialist will prepare the plan. The plan will specify activities to involve the stakeholder \ngroups in the following activities: (i) data collection and analysis, (ii) criteria for prioritization of \nwatersheds, (iii) identification of issues and responsive actions, (iv) validation of the feasibility of the \nactions proposed, (v) management arrangements to conduct participation activities, and (vi) budget \nformulation for the participation activities.      \n \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.    What  are  the  key  gender  issues  in  the  sector/subsector  that  are  likely  to  be  relevant  to  this \nproject/program?  They are exclusion of women in granting of tenure instruments, displacement of \nwomen in the adoption of new production and marketing practices, alteration of existing work \nrelationship between genders, and existing values that may put women at a disadvantage.    \n \n2.   Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s \nempowerment  by  improving  women\u2019s  access  to  and  use  of  opportunities,  services,  resources, \nassets, and participation in decision making?     Yes      No   A gender action plan will be \nprepared during the project preparatory technical assistance to ensure the following: (i) women will \nnot be disadvantaged by the interventions, (ii) interventions will rectify any existing gender inequities, \n(iii) opportunities that will be realized from the interventions will equally benefit men and women, (iv) \ninvolved institutions will have the capability to ensure that gender equity will be upheld in project \nimplementation, (v) the SDP will be consistent with the national gender plan.  \n \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ninequality?
