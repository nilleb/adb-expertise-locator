Following the First and the Second Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nProjects (the earlier projects), the Third Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nProject  (the  project)  will  support  the  ongoing  efforts  of  the  Government  of  Nepal  (the \ngovernment) to further improve water supply and sanitation service delivery in small towns in \nNepal. The project will follow the government\u2019s 15-year Development Plan1 (the Development \nPlan) to develop the water and sanitation sector for small towns. The PPTA will leverage the \nexperience gained from the earlier projects, and incorporate lessons learned to prepare for the \nproject. The PPTA will assist the government in amending the Development Plan, preparing \ncost estimates and financing plan and the feasibility studies of the sample subprojects, with a \nspecial  focus  on  structuring  and  refining  the  project  design,  including  rationale,  modality, \nappraisal, financing, implementation and institutional arrangements, and developing eligibility \nand evaluation criteria for future subproject selection in close consultation with the government \nand ADB. Upon finalizing the project modality, the PPTA will prepare the project, following \nADB\u2019s  due  diligence  requirements.  The  PPTA  will  also  support  consultations  with  various \nstakeholders. Implementation of the PPTA is for 18 months, from July 2013 to December 2014. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The PPTA will gain a thorough understanding of the government\u2019s objectives through \nconsultation, identify the hindrances of current institutional arrangements and capacity of the \nresponsible agencies, advise on measures to mitigate institutional deficiency, and incorporate \nthe lessons learned from past project implementation in the design of the project. The PPTA will \nprepare a sector development plan and a sector road map for the sector project. One essential \ntask the PPTA will undertake is to evaluate, on a sampling basis, the infrastructure proposal by \nthe  government  in  conjunction  with  the  PPTA\u2019s  analysis  of  the  existing  water  supply  and \nsanitation situation for eight subproject towns (sample subproject towns), including five newly \nidentified subproject towns and three subproject towns from earlier projects, determine the \nadequate  subproject  scope  for  the  sample  subproject  towns,  establish,  as  a  result  of  the \nevaluation, feasible and prioritized selection criteria for the remaining subproject towns under \nthe  project, and assist to institutionalize the subproject implementation procedures. The PPTA \nwill  conduct  surveys,  feasibility  analysis,  financial  and  economic  analyses,  and  social  and \nenvironmental safeguard assessments in accordance with ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines.
