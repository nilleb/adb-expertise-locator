INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) did not appear in \nthe country strategy and program for Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR), and Viet Nam because the innovation described in the TA was not envisioned at the \npreparation of the country partnership strategy. The regional capacity development TA concept \nwas initially presented and endorsed by the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries at the \n10th Annual Meeting of the Working Group for Human Resource Development held in the Lao \nPDR in May 2011. The GMS countries requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to identify \nand develop programs and actions for climate change and disaster-affected communities. In \nJuly 2011, a fact-finding mission was fielded in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam and \nagreements were reached on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference.1 The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Climate change impacts are not gender neutral. There is a strong rationale to link the \nimpacts of climate change on natural resource depletion and livelihoods with gender roles and \nresponsibilities. In the face of seasonal and/or catastrophic climate change events, women are \nless equipped to respond and, due to gender roles, often face the brunt of these events. Women \nand  girls  have  disproportionately  poor  access  to  employment  and  income  generating \nopportunities, and low socioeconomic status. In addition, the provision of services (clean water, \nwaste management, and household energy) and associated exposure to environmental hazards \nare linked to gender roles. Disproportionate impacts on poor and vulnerable groups, and in \nparticular on women, disrupt livelihoods, produce unsafe environments and limit access to clean \nwater and essential services. \n \n3.  Women are powerful agents of change in promoting climate change responses\u2014and not \nsimply hapless victims of climate change\u2014as they are traditional stewards and managers of \nwater, fuel, and waste resources. Evidence, including from Nepal and India,2 demonstrates that \nlinkages that serve to empower women as resource managers and entrepreneurs constitute a \npowerful  strategy  to  address  local  and  global  environment  concerns.  Despite  this,  an \ninstitutional gender blindness to women\u2019s participation and contributions results in resource \nmanagement being incorrectly treated as \u2015gender neutral\u2016. National energy, transport and urban \ndevelopment policies and organizations overlook women\u2019s specific needs and contributions.  \n \n4.  Climate  change  financing  mechanisms  have  neglected  sustainable  development \nconcerns. As a result of the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to mobilize $30 \nbillion in climate change financing for 2010\u20132012, and $100 billion per year by 2020. Dedicated \nfinancing windows and partnerships have been established, but despite increasing attention on \nlow-carbon and climate-resilient growth paths, the social dimensions of climate change are \npoorly understood. Climate change financing mechanisms have been criticized for prioritizing \ngreenhouse gas emission reductions over sustainable development concerns. Many financial \ninstruments responding to the climate change challenge are new and just beginning to consider \nsocial safeguards to govern their distribution. Vulnerable, resource-dependent groups such as \nindigenous peoples are being taken into account in emerging policy discussions, but gender \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 September 2011. \n2   http://www.wepco.org.np/what-we-do/swm-activities/ and http://labl.teriin.org/.  \n ", "2 \nconcerns are sorely missing. A new approach is needed to weave gender concerns into national \nor subnational strategies, action plans, and screening processes so that (i) gender concerns are \nincorporated in project design guidelines, (ii) impacts are monitored or verified, and (iii) wider \nstakeholder representation in national climate change planning forums is enabled. Innovative \napproaches are needed to ensure climate change financing mechanisms value sustainable \ndevelopment benefits and facilitate projects with high development impact and gender co-\nbenefits. \n \n5.  In addition to recognizing the impact of climate change on national development and the \nimportance of developing strategy and action plans in response, there is a need to include \ngender in policy discussions and institutional capacity development. These include (i) national \nand provincial authorities responsible for the capture, regulation, and distribution of climate \nchange  finance;  (ii)  national  women\u2019s  ministries,  which  are  mandated  to  promote  gender \nmainstreaming, but lack expertise to respond to technical sectors related to climate change; and \n(iii) communities positioned to identify projects that meet local needs and priorities, but that lack \nknowledge of technical and financial requirements to access carbon finance opportunities. \n \n6.  Low-carbon  technologies  and  access  to  carbon  financing  opportunities  present  co-\nbenefits for women. The considerable funding mobilized under the existing carbon finance \nmechanisms  provides  opportunities  for  projects  with  significant  implications  for  local  and \nwomen\u2019s livelihoods. Carbon finance projects can reduce the vulnerability of women to climate \nchange by providing more secure livelihoods and access to modern technology, while also \npromoting  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  for  environmental  sustainability  and  gender \nequality (goals 3 and 7). Women could spend less time obtaining fuel wood, have access to \ncleaner  energy  sources  and  clean  water,  provide  safe  local  environmental  conditions  and \nimprove their own livelihoods. In urban areas, renewable energies, landfill methane recovery \nand  utilization  as  energy,  comprehensive  waste  management,  and  alternative  waste \nmanagement (recycling,  composting  and  others)  have  been  identified  as  priority  mitigation \noptions that also address these issues. \n \n7.  There are a number of established low-carbon technologies, but inadequate financing is \navailable to enable these to spread. The transaction costs are expected to be high, which has \nhindered both small-scale project development and access to climate finance. Despite their \noften significant social development impact, the distributive costs associated with high client \nspread may make international finance institutions less inclined to make significant investments \nin  human  resource-intensive  projects.  An  additional  challenge  that  can  inhibit  small-scale \nprojects from accessing climate finance is high upfront project development costs. However, \ndespite these development challenges, climate financing is attractive as it offers a long-term \nsource of revenue to sustain projects. Further, given women\u2019s roles and responsibilities in fuel \nand waste management, low-carbon technologies provide a platform to improve the global \nenvironment and empower women through co-benefits.3 Revenue from market-based climate \nmechanisms, such as carbon markets, provides an important opportunity to empower women\u2019s \ngroups to implement these technologies as an entrepreneurial initiative, earning benefits from \nthe carbon revenue and developing skills to handle clean technologies and improved waste \nmanagement approaches. \n                                                \n3  Co-benefits reduce time from fuel collection; enable income generation opportunities from distribution/maintenance \nof low-carbon technologies; reduce health and sanitation risks; and increase access to clean energy sources. \n ", "3 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the regional capacity development TA will be improved access to low-\ncarbon  technology  and  improved  livelihoods  of  women  in  urban  and  peri-urban  areas  in \ndeveloping member country (DMC) pilot sites through carbon revenue financing. The expected \noutcome of the TA will be an improved enabling environment for gender sensitive climate \nchange mitigation policies and finance in target DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The purpose of the TA is to influence the supply and demand of gender-equitable \nclimate change responses. Increasing supply driven responses involves building the skill levels \nof  government  agencies  responsible  for  subnational  climate  change  responses  such  that \nclimate change strategies, actions plans and screening mechanisms are gender-inclusive. The \npromotion  of  supply  and  demand-driven  responses  from  women\u2019s  ministries  (which  are \nmandated to support gender mainstreaming) involves equipping them with the skills needed to \nengage  in  and  promote  gender-equitable  benefit-capture  from  climate  change  responses. \nBeneficiary demand-driven responses include support that (i) develops the skills of beneficiaries \nto effectively advocate to influence policy, (ii) improves their knowledge, and (iii) helps them \nacquire the skills needed to access resources from climate change finance mechanisms. The \nTA will have three main outputs. \n \n10.  Output 1. Gender concerns mainstreamed in national or provincial climate change \nstrategies, action plans and mitigation plans. This component will develop the capacity of \nnational and provincial agencies responsible for climate change responses to integrate gender \nanalysis  into  climate  change  strategies,  action  plans,  screening  criteria,  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and benefit distribution of low-carbon projects.4 The capacity of national and/or \nprovincial women\u2019s agencies, which are mandated to support gender mainstreaming, will be \nstrengthened in terms of the expertise needed to engage in and promote more gender-equitable \nbenefit capture in technical sectors related to climate change. In addition to creating an enabling \nenvironment  for  wider  stakeholder  participation  in  policy  dialogue  and  a  greater  share  of \nbenefits from low-carbon projects, the TA will build the strength of women\u2019s entrepreneur groups \nthrough the provision of functional training and follow-up support related to women\u2019s leadership, \nnegotiation and advocacy skills, monitoring and evaluation, and know-how to access carbon \nfinancing. \n \n                                                \n4  The TA will respond to the different opportunities and stages in climate change policy development present in each \ncountry. Cambodia is in the initial stage of preparing a Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan to provide a \nstrategic framework for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The National Adaptation Programme of Action to \nClimate Change (NAPA) was prepared in October 2006. The Cambodia Climate Change Alliance, coordinated by \nthe Ministry of Environment, manages a trust fund to support climate change projects. The current cycle of \napplications prioritizes adaptation projects based on the NAPA. The Viet Nam Climate Change Strategy to 2050 \nhas recently been drafted by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment for consultation.

Effective mechanism supporting stakeholder engagement process and \ngender-equitable  benefit  distribution  identified  for  replication.  A  Regional  Knowledge \nCoordination Hub will be established to support an enabling environment, share and exchange \nnational pilot lessons, provide a convening platform for stakeholder consultations, and promote \ncontinuous monitoring and  evaluation  and  enhancement  of  capacity-building  activities. The \npurpose will be to facilitate communication and build capacity to mainstream gender issues into \nclimate  change  planning  at  operational  and  policy  levels.  At  the  operational  level,  the \nconsultation  will  build  upon  lessons  from  developing  guiding  principles  for  evaluation  and \nrevenue  sharing,  while  policy-level  consultations  will  focus  on  enabling reforms  needed to \nintegrate gender  into  nationally  appropriate  mitigation  actions  and  national  climate  change \nstrategies. Starting with the sharing of outcomes and lessons from this TA, knowledge will be \nreflected through established sector and knowledge-sharing groups5 to sustain best practice \napproaches in and outside the region. \n \n12.  Output 3. Three pilot projects successfully implemented by women\u2019s groups6 to \ndevelop  local  tools  and  mechanisms  in  order  to  access  climate  financing.  The  pilot \nprojects will demonstrate a model of female entrepreneurs addressing climate change issues. \nThe pilot will focus on women\u2019s groups as agents of change, enabling them to take action to \nimprove urban services, including small-scale renewable energy systems and upgrading and \nmaintaining distributed wastewater treatment and solid waste management systems.7 The TA \nwill assist women\u2019s groups in accessing climate financing to demonstrate how climate financing \ncan provide benefits to women for their contributions to greenhouse gas reductions, in addition \nto productive industries. The Technical Support Facility from ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Program \nand other support agents will work in close coordination with regional and national coordinators \nand national women\u2019s groups in helping to identify and develop low-carbon projects that seek \nco-benefits and are prospective for various sources of climate change financing, including the \ncarbon markets. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $3 million equivalent, of which $2.7 million equivalent \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) to be administered by \nADB. Technical support will be allocated according to need and will be balanced among the \nthree countries. The governments of Cambodia, the Lao PDR and Viet Nam will fund the \nremaining $300,000 equivalent in kind by providing office accommodation, counterpart staff, and \nsupport facilities. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency.  Overall  supervision  and  guidance  for  TA \n                                                \n5  Established sector and climate change knowledge sharing groups include GMS Working Group on Agriculture, \nGMS Working Group on Environment, Cities Development Initiative for Asia platform, Asia Pacific Water Forum \nWater knowledge hubs, Environment Operations Center, The Institute for Global Environmental Strategies and \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change platforms etc. \n6  One pilot project per country.  \n7  Small-scale  renewable  energy  refers  to  production  and  marketing  of  improved  cook  stoves.  Low-carbon \ntechnologies  for  distributed  water  and  waste  management  may  include  (i)  community-based  garbage  and \nrecyclables collection and/or sale, (ii) engaging women\u2019s groups in management of solid waste entering municipal \nlandfills through solid waste separation and composting of the organic portions, and (iii) improved solid waste \nmanagement and handling of organic component through decentralized anaerobic digestion (with the additional \nbenefit of biogas and fertilizer generation at small and medium scale). \n ", "5 \n \nimplementation and stakeholder coordination will be provided by a steering committee led by \nthe GMS Working Group Agriculture coordinator (Cambodia); GMS National Secretariat (Lao \nPDR); and Quang Binh Provincial People\u2019s Committee (Viet Nam). The Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry and Fisheries will be the implementing agency in Cambodia. The Ministry of Natural \nResources  and  Environment  will  be  the  implementing  agency  in  the  Lao  PDR,  and  the \nDepartment of Natural Resources and Environment will be the implementing agency in Viet \nNam.  The  TA  technical  support  unit  will  be  based  in  the  GMS  Environmental  Operations \nCenter,8 located in Bangkok, to ensure synergy with other GMS regional cooperation programs. \nThe ADB resident mission teams will work closely with implementing agencies to supervise \npilots,  depending  upon  capacity.  The  implementation  structure  is  within  existing  country \ninstitutional  arrangements  as  diagrammed  in  the  Supplementary  Appendix  (available  upon \nrequest). \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, from 1 January 2012 to 31 December \n2014. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Four types of consulting \nservices are required, using 69 person-months of international consultant services and 95 \nperson-months of national consultant services. Consulting  recruitment arrangements are  in \nAppendix 4. ADB will select and engage consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will \nbe made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  All  procurement  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Advance actions for recruitment \nwill be undertaken to ensure timely fielding of consultants immediately after TA effectiveness. \nAfter completion of the TA, the equipment will be handed over to the implementing agencies. \n \n16.  The Regional Knowledge Coordination Hub will provide the institutional structure for \ndissemination of good practices and lessons from the pilot projects and benefit distribution \nmechanisms. In addition to transfer of technical knowledge and capacity to DMC national \nagencies and women\u2019s groups\u2019 project participants, outcomes and lessons generated from this \nTA will be reflected through established sector and knowledge-sharing groups  to sustain such \nbest practice approaches in and outside the region. The key results and lessons of the TA will \nbe disseminated through national, regional and international seminar briefings; NDF briefing \nmaterials; ADB Southeast Asia Urban Development and Water Division knowledge products; \nand the ADB website.
