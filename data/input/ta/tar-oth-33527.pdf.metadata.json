The Board of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Policy on Indigenous\nPeoples  in April 1998. The policy provides a framework for ADB's commitment to recognize the\n1 \nvulnerability  of  indigenous  peoples  and  identify  measures  to  satisfy  their  needs  and\ndevelopment  aspirations.  The  policy focuses on the  participation of  indigenous  peoples in\ndevelopment and the mitigation of the undesired effects of development processes.\n2.  This regional technical assistance {TA  ),2 one of the initiatives induded  in the policy, was\nrecommended by the First Indigenous Peoples Forum conducted in conjunction with the 33rd\nAnnual meeting of ADB's  Board of Governors. The T A aims to improve the implementation\nquality of ADB-financed loans and build the capacity of governments and indigenous peoples\nand ethnic minority groups and organizations to address issues facing indigenous peoples and\nethnic minorities in the developing member countries (DMCs).\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3.  The  Indigenous peoples  policy describes indigenous peoples or  ethnic minorities as\ngroups that have a social or cultural identity distinct from the dominant or mainstream society\nwithin a particular country. This can make them vulnerable in the process of development. With\na substantial portion of the world's indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities living in Asia and the\nPacific, virtually every country in ADB's region has an indigenous or minority population.3 Many\nstudies show that Asian indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities belong to the poor and extremely\npoor strata; most live in increasingly degraded socioecological environments.4 The vast majority\nof Asian indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities are no longer isolated from the forces of\ndevelopment, which are often introduced at the price and loss of traditional  livelihoods and\nlifestyles. Most indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities ancestral territories now contain the last\nremaining natural resources in Asia.\n4.  In the past decades,  an increasing number of ADB-sponsored  development projects\nhave spread to quite remote areas where indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities live. Some of the\nprojects  are  specifically  designed  to  benefit  certain  indigenous  peoples/ethnic  minority\ncommunities,  while  others  are  designed  to  benefit  much  wider  communities  with  certain\ncomponents of the project being geared to addressing the specific needs of the indigenous\npeoples/ethnic minority communities  and other components entirely neglecting their needs.5\nHowever, there have not been any systematic efforts to evaluate if ADB-sponsored programs\n1 The working definition of indigenousp eoples employedb y ADB identifiesi ndigenousp eoples as groups with a\nsocial or cultural identity distinct from the dominant or mainstream society.

The Fact-finding Mission comprising of I.

Since  1998,  ADB  has  recognized  the  vulnerability  of  indigenous  peoples/ethnic\nminorities in development 'processes. The indigenous peoples policy states that development\ninterventions should be compatible in substance and structure with the affected people's culture\n,\nand socioeconomic institutions, and in line with the needs, aspirations, and demands of the\naffected  people.  Concern for  indigenous  peoples/ethnic  minorities should  be  reflected  and\nintegrated into each step of policy development cycles, programming, project design, project\nprocessing,  project  implementation,  and  project  monitoring and  evaluation  processes.  The\npolicy provides the institutional framework, initiatives, and mechanisms for ADS's commitment\nto maximize the benefit of ADS's interventions for indigenous/ethnic minority peoples and, at the\nsame time, minimize the negative impacts. One of the important points of the policy is the\nindusion  of  a  safeguard  provision.  If indigenous  peoples/ethnic minorities  are  likely to  be\nsignificantly affected by an ADS intervention, an indigenous peoples development plan should\nbe prepared as part of the project or program for ADS financing. The  plan can provide an\nopportunity  for  proactive  interventions  to  improve  the  status  and well-being  of  indigenous\npeoples/ethnic minorities.\n6.  ADB also recentlya dopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal.6 This strategy has\ncaptured the  basic problems that should be addressed in efforts to reduce  poverty among\nindigenous peoples/ethnic minorities. ADB defines poverty as \"a deprivation of essential assets\nand opportunities to which every human is entitled.\" The ADB strategy affirms that  beyond\nincome and basic services, individuals and societies are also poor-and  tend to remain so-if\nthey are not empowered to participate in making the decisions that shape their lives.  Many of\nthe problems that shape the poverty among indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities lie precisely in\nthe process of decision making of projects and programs that affect their lives. ADB (footnote 6)\nacknowledges that poverty measurements should go beyond income and basic services to also\n\"serve as a proxy for other important intangibles, such as feelings of powerlessness and lack of\nfreedom to participate.-  In connection with poverty among indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities,\nADB's strategy for poverty reduction recognizes clearly that people might be poor on account of\ntheir ethnic/cultural identity. The strategy challenges the development practice that has often led\nindigenous peoples/ethnic minorities to feel ppwerless and to lack freedom to participate.\n7.  ADB's  indigenous  peoples  policy  calls  for  a  strong  commitment  to  recognize\nsociocultural  rights  of  indigenous  peoples/ethnic  minorities  and  specific  circumstances.\nHowever, many DMCs need to build their capacity to adequately respond to policy requirements\n.\nwhen  processing ADB-sponsored  programs and  projects. Although governments  may have\ngenuine goodwill to follow ADB's policy requirements, often they lack the tools, skills, resources,\nconceptual  understanding, or  institutional  capacity  to  respond adequately  to  the  needs of\nindigenous  peoples/ethnic minorities. Similarly, indigenous peoples/ethnic minority groups or\nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are hampered from actively participating in the program\nor project formulation and implementation cycle. This is partly because of the limited familiarity\nwith  processing  procedures and partly due to their  lack of  institutional capacity to fruitfully\ncontribute to and become part of the process.\n- \ne R-179-99:F ightingP  overtyi n Asia and the Pacific  The Poverty ReductionS trategyo f the Asian Development\nBank, 9 November.", "3\n8.  In the Philippines, indigenous peoples/ethnic minority groups  and organizations have\nplayed a major role at the national, regional, and intemationallevels.  The state policies relating\nto  indigenous  peoples/ethnic  minorities are quite well developed.  The  Indigenous Peoples'\nRights Act of  1997 protects indigenous peoples' rights with  regard to ancestral domain and\nlands,  self-govemance  and  empowerment,  social justice  and  human  rights,  and  cultural\nintegrity. Under the act, the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples was founded in 1998\nto comprehensively manage indigenous peoples issues. The World Bank has prepared a study\non the legal profiles of indigenous peoples/ethic minorities in the Philippines. At least 10 ADB-\nsponsored  projects are  significantly  affecting or targeted at  indigenous  peoples and ethnic\nminorities in the Philippines.\n9.  In Indonesia indigenous peoples/ethnic minority groups and organizations only recently\nbegan  to  playa  strong  role  at  the  national  level. At  least  nine  ADB-sponsored  projects\nsignificantly affect or are targeted at indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities. The Indonesian Basic\nAgrarian Law of 1960 recognizes indigenous peoples rights to communal land, and under the\nWorld Bank-sponsored Land Administration Project, there has been an attempt to register the\nlands  under traditional  title.  In  Indonesia there is no specific  government  agency primarily\ndealing with indigenous peoples/ethnic minority issues, and comprehensive state policies are\nyet  to  be developed.  The  Indonesian Government and  indigenous  peoples/ethnic  minority\ngroups have begun to dialogue in an attempt to formulate a policy.\n10.  The  Governments  of  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam  have  expressed  keen  interest  in\nstrengthening  their  policies  relating  to  indigenous  peoples/ethnic  minorities  and  poverty\nreduction. At least five ADS-sponsored  projects are significantly affecting  or are targeted at\nindigenous peoples in Viet Nam, and the number of such types of projects will increase in the\nnear future. In 1996, the World Sank also prepared a Viet Nam ethnic minorities' country profile,\nwhich covers a range of issues such as population, health and nutrition, education, cultural\nvitality, land and production systems, and participation. Cambodia has likewise been a recipient\nof ADS TA. In 1999, about 14 TAs were provided to the country. It is likely that ADS-sponsored\nprojects earmarked for indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities will continue to expand in the near\nfuture in Cambodia and in the Greater Mekong Region in general.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\nObjective\n11.  The TA   has two objectives: (i) to strengthen ADS's Policy on Indigenous Peoples with a\npoverty assessment of this sector in selected DMCs, and (ii) to develop,  using participatory\nmethods, an appropriate agenda for action to ensure poverty reduction for indigenous groups.\nThe specific objectives are to (i) conduct a poverty assessment of indigenous peoples/ethnic\nminorities and examine the DMCs' relevant national policies and legislation, programs, projects,\nand  initiatives  pertaining  to  indigenous  groups/ethnic  minorities  as  these  address  the\nmultifaceted dimensions of poverty; (ii) evaluate and assess the impact of ADS's interventions\nthat address the vulnerability and poverty of indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities in the DMCs;\nand  (iii)  provide  capacity  building  for  government,  NGOs,  and  indigenous  peoples/ethnic\nminority groups so that they can actively participate in formulating action plans as well as in\nADS-sponsored programs and projects. The T A framework is attached as Appendix 1.", "4\nScope\n12.  The T A will cover four DMCs-Cambodia,  Indonesia, Philippines, and Viet Nam. These\nDMCs have a significant number of indigenous peoples/ethnic minority communities that are\ndisproportionately poor and where ADB-sponsored programs and projects have a good potential\nto include the communities' concerns. The governments of the four countries ha'/e exhibited\ngoodwill in following ADB's policy requirements. The need for similar T A in other DMCs will be\nconsidered at the successful conclusion of the T A.\n~\n13.  The TA   consists of two phases. Phase 1 will take three months and phase 2 2.5 months.\nPhase 1 will comprise information gathering; identification of policies, agencies, programs, and\nactivities; and primary research on indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities and poverty reduction\nacross the  region and  on  a country-specific  basis. A participatory  poverty  assessment will\nfollow, and six provincial training workshops (two for Indonesia, two for  the Philippines, and one\neach  for  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam) will  be conducted.  In this  phase,  an  analysis  will  be\nconducted of the various policies relating to indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities and poverty\nreduction, as well as how policies and institutions are effectively and efficiently translated into\nprogram and project implementation. ADB's interventions through projects and programs will\nalso be evaluated. A background paper will examine priority issues in the DMCs for addressing\nthe needs of indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities. The paper will be developed in consultation\nand in liaison with key actors, including the governments, international agencies, NGOs and\nindigenous  organizations,  drawing  on  their experiences  and analysis.  This  component will\nprovide the basis for phase 2.\n14.  Phase 2 will comprise country-specificc apacityb  uilding for governmenta nd indigenous\npeoples/ethnicm  inority groups and organizations,n ationalw  orkshops,o ne regional workshop,\nand completiono f the final report and action plans. Capacity building will focus on enhancing\nstakeholders'a ctive participationi n the program-projecct ycle. Whichw  ill include developinga \nparticipatorya  pproach to identifying, planning, implementing,m  onitoring, and evaluating the\nprogram or  project.  The  national workshops will  build  awareness about  indigenous\npeoples/ethnicm  inority issuesa  nd poverty issuesa  mongs takeholders.E ach nationalw  orkshop\nwill develop an action plan for the concerned country and a preliminary guideline that will\nprovide a step-by-step procedure on how to estimate the impact of ADB's interventionso n\nindigenousp eoples/ethnicm  inorities.K  ey stakeholdersf rom the four countriesw  ill be invited to\na regional workshop. Broader regionwide concems of indigenous peoples related to poverty\nreductionw  ill be discussed.A   synthesis overviewr eport, a guideline to estimate the impact of\ninterventionso n indigenousp eoples/ethnicm  inorities,a  frameworkf or stakeholderp articipation\nin the project cycle, as well as a regionala  ction plan will be prepared.R  epresentativeso f other\ninternationala genciesw  ill be invitedt o share informationi n the workshop.\n.\nc.\nCost Estimates  and Financing  Plan\n15.  The total cost of the T A is estimated at $400,000.The TA   will be financed by ADB on a\ngrant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA    program. The cost  will  cover  consulting  services,\nworkshops  and consultations, travel, and contingencies. The cost estimates for the T A are\nshown in Appendix 2.", "5\nD. ImplementationA rrangements\n16.  The TA   requires 5.5 person-months for international consulting services together with 40\nperson-rnonths of domestic consulting. Individual international and domestic consultants will be\nrecruited according to ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The international consultant\nshould be an expert in indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities and poverty issues. and be gender\nsensitive.  She/he  should  have  experiences  with  the  government,  NGOs,  and  indigenous\npeoples/ethnic minority groups and organizations in at least two of the proposed countries, and\nbe familiar with the operations and social policies of international organizations/agencies. Being\ngender  sensitive,  all  domestic  consultants will  have significant  experience  with  indigenous\npeoples/ethnic minority issues and poverty issues in their respective country. The international\nconsultant,  designated  as team  leader, will  take  responsibility for  organizing  the  research,.\nconsultations with stakeholders, and national and regional workshops; supervising the country\nstudies;  and  producing the  inception,  interim, and final  reports. The  domestic  consultants,\nsupervised by the international consultant, will prepare the country studies. The four country\nstudies will  be submitted  at the  end of  month four.  The outline terms  of  reference  are  in\nAppendix 3.\n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA  . The Social Development Division will\nguide TA implementation. In each selected country, the most relevant government agency will\nbe the focal  agency. As appropriate, various other agencies will  participate actively. These\ninclude the ministries or departments relevant to indigenous peoples/ethnic minority affairs and\npoverty reduction, indigenous peoples/ethnic minority groups and organizations,  NGOs, and\nother related civil society organizations.\n18.  The TA   is expected to commence on 15 November 2000 and be completed within 12\nmonths after the consultantsa re fielded.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of regional technical assistance, on a grant basis, in the amount not exceeding the\nequivalent  of $400,000 for the  purpose of Capacity Building for  Indigenous  Peoples/Ethnic\nMinority  Issues  and  Poverty  Reduction,  and  hereby  reports  such  action  to  the  Board.", "9\n .\nf;tl'ddeup!x ~  de6e ~\n.J3>:HNI>:W f\\N>:3~~3MO~f)\n)~eleJeu>:e !U tecp: deBa \u00a3 'deJe\" ~ ~ (", "7\nAppendix 1, page 2\nOutputs .  .  . \nInception workshop  Finalize inception  Inception report  Delay in identifying\n. \nreport for the T A  Phase 1 framework  appropriate consultants\nPhase 1  .
