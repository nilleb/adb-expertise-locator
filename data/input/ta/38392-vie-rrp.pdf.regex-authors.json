Environmental implications were reviewed and no \nAssessment  adverse environmental impacts identified. \n   \nProgram Description  The  program  loan  will  support  implementation  of  the  Poverty \nReduction Program outlined under the Fourth Poverty Reduction \nSupport Credit (PRSC 4), as part of the Government\u2019s overall \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \n(CPRGS). This annual PRSC is part of the current PRSC cycle, \nwhich covers 5-years, the same as the CPRGS. The CPRGS \nprovides  a  medium-term  framework  (2002-2006)  for  poverty \nreduction policies, programs, and actions with specific targets for \ndevelopment outcomes by 2006. \n   \nRationale  Over  the  last  decade  the  Government  has  quickly  reduced \npoverty and achieved a high level of economic growth. Poverty \nreduction largely resulted from economic growth, which created \njobs and provided better livelihoods. To maintain this trend, the \nGovernment must continue its program of effective policy reform, \nto  remove  remaining  structural  weaknesses,  promote  socially \ninclusive  development,  and  modernize  governance  and  public \nadministration.  The  proposed  program  loan  supports \nimplementation  of  the  CPRGS,  which  is  designed  to  reduce \npoverty and realize other Viet Nam Development Goals. As part \nof  the  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  community,  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has adopted the CPRGS as the \nreference  document  for  planning  external  assistance.  The \nCPRGS  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy, \ncountry  strategy  and  program,  and  the  poverty  partnership \nagreement with Viet Nam. \n   \n  World  Bank  support  includes  four  PRSCs,  approved  in  2002 \n(US$250 million), 2003 (US$100 million), 2004 (US$100 million), \nand 2005 (US$100 million). The focus of these operations has \ngradually shifted from reform of state-owned commercial banks \n(SOCBs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to a broader policy \nagenda,  covering  a  number  of  sectors  and  issues  affecting \npoverty reduction and growth. \n   ", "ii   \n  The  ODA  community  considers  the  PRSC  an  important \ninstrument for supporting CPRGS implementation. In 2005, 10 \nmajor ODA partners, namely ADB, Canada, Denmark, European \nCommission,  France,  Ireland,  Japan,  Netherlands,  Spain,  and \nUnited Kingdom, are cofinancing PRSC 4 with the World Bank. \n   \n  ADB has been actively involved in formulating PRSC 4. ADB has \npromoted policy dialogue on similar issues through its program \nlending activities and sector policy reforms. PRSC 4 complements \nADB support of Viet Nam\u2019s policy and institutional reforms. As a \nmultisector  instrument  covering  a  range  of  issues  related  to \npoverty reduction, the PRSC framework provides ADB with an \nopportunity to (i) advance and widen national policy dialogue in a \nwell-coordinated and comprehensive manner, (ii) provide lending \nand  nonlending  assistance  in  coordination  with  other  ODA \npartners, and (iii) ensure that key policy issues affecting ADB \noperations  in  Viet  Nam  are  addressed  in  the  policy  dialogue \nbetween  the  Government  and  the  ODA  community  to  help \nachieve the common goals of poverty reduction and growth. \n   \n  The proposed program loan adheres to ADB\u2019s recent endeavors \nto  adopt  program-based  and  sector  approaches  in  its  lending \noperations to reduce transaction costs for its developing member \ncountries  as  well  as  for  its  own  operations.  The  approach  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  reform  agenda,  Long-Term  Strategic \nFramework,  and  Medium-Term  Strategy,  and  will  directly  help \nfulfill ADB\u2019s obligations to the Rome Declaration on harmonizing \nprocedures  of  multilateral  development  banks  (February  2003) \nand the recent Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (February\u2013\nMarch 2005). \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of the proposed program loan is to reduce \npoverty and sustain high economic growth in Viet Nam. The loan \nwill  help  fund  PRSC  4  and  thereby  produce  the  following \noutcomes:  (i)  reduced  structural  weaknesses  and  improved \nbusiness  environment,  (ii)  promotion  of  socially  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  development,  and  (iii)  modernized \ngovernance. \n   \nCost Estimates  Policy  measures  supported  by  PRSC  operations,  such  as  the \nsafety net for redundant SOE workers, restructuring of SOCBs, or \ncreation of provincial health care for the poor require additional \nspending. These are costly and PRSC-specific programs. The \nPRSC cost of adjustment is therefore greater than the cost of \nthese  four  items.  The  external  financing  needs  for  the  2005 \nbudget (including grants) is estimated at US$1.4 billion, calculated \nas  financing  needs  less  revenue  carried  over  from  2004  and \ndomestic borrowing. \n   ", "                       iii\n \n  The estimated cost of some specific PRSC-related programs for \nthe 2005 budget is approximately US$770 million, i.e., (i) health \nfunds  for  the  poor\u2014about  US$90  million  due  to  expanded \ncoverage of beneficiaries according to the new poverty definition; \n(ii)  increased  spending  on  education  proportional  to  the \nGovernment budget\u2014about US$400 million; and (iii) social safety \nnet program for retrenched SOE workers, covering more than \n50,000  workers\u2014at  least  US$80 million;  and  (iv)  resolution  of \nnonperforming  loans  and  other  related  costs\u2014about  US$200 \nmillion.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A total of approximately US$225 million is expected to be funded \nfor PRSC 4 operations through ODA resources. The World Bank \nhas  already  approved  a  US$100  million  credit  from  the \nInternational Development Association to support PRSC 4. Three \nother cofinanciers will provide concessional loans, namely ADB \n(US$15  million),  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation \n(US$22.8  million  equivalent),  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (\u20ac10 million). The remaining seven cofinanciers \nwill  provide  grants,  i.e.,  Agencia  Espa\u00f1ola  de  Cooperaci\u00f3n \nInternacional  (\u20ac2  million),  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency (Can$6 million), Denmark (US$10.8 million equivalent), \nEuropean  Commission  (\u20ac8  million),  Ireland  (\u20ac1.5  million), \nNetherlands (\u20ac8 million), and United Kingdom\u2019s Department for \nInternational Development (\u20a420 million). \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of US$15 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will \nbe provided. The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period \nand 1.5% during the amortization period, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan \nproceeds may be used to finance eligible imports incurred within \n180 days prior to the date of loan effectiveness. The loan reflects \nADB\u2019s support for implementation of the CPRGS following the \npolicy framework of the PRSC 4 program. The loan will contribute \nto financing adjustment costs resulting from implementation of the \npolicy  matrix,  particularly  prior  actions  for  PRSC  4,  and  will \nsupport and facilitate the Government\u2019s continued and deepened \nreform program for poverty reduction. \n   \nDisbursement  The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The loan will be fully utilized by 31 December 2006. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) will be the Executing Agency; \nit works in close collaboration with the World Bank to prepare and \nimplement the PRSCs. \n   \n ", "iv   \nImplementation  Three  main  arrangements  have  been  made  to  implement  this \nArrangements  program. First, the National Steering Committee was established \nin May 2002 to implement the CPRGS and PRSCs. It is chaired \nby the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reforms, and \ncomprises representatives from 24 relevant line ministries and \ngovernment agencies. An SBV deputy governor acts as standing \nvice  chairman.  The  steering  committee  has  several \nrepresentatives  from  key  economic  ministries,  such  as  the \nministries  of  agriculture  and  rural  development;  education  and \ntraining; finance; justice; labor, invalids, and social affairs; and \ntrade;  as  well  as  the  Office  of  the  Government;  the  Party's \nEconomic Commission; and SBV; representing PRSC 4\u2019s policy \nreform areas. \n   \n  Second, an interministerial working group was established in the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment, comprising representatives \nfrom key ministries responsible for the policy reform areas under \nthe  PRSCs.  Its  goal  is  to  help  implement  the  CPRGS  at \nsubnational  levels.  Third,  also  established  with  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning  and  Investment  is  the  CPRGS  Secretariat,  which \nsupports provincial governments in adapting the CPRGS to their \nown context, and reformulating plans and budgets accordingly. \nSBV is assigned as the agency responsible for preparing and \nimplementing the PRSCs.  \n   \nProcurement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program \nloan will be disbursed to Viet Nam as the Borrower.  \n   \n  No supporting import documentation will be required, if during \neach year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the \nvalue of Viet Nam\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other \nODA is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected \nto be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its \ncompliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will \nbe  required.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s \ncertification. \n   ", "                       v\n \nProject Benefits and  The program loan will benefit Vietnamese people and businesses \nBeneficiaries  on three fronts. First, through policy actions designed to facilitate \nViet Nam\u2019s transition to a market economy, the loan will increase \nefficiency, accelerate economic growth, and create jobs. These \npolicy  actions  include  preparing  for  World  Trade  Organization \naccession,  accelerating  the  divestiture  of  SOEs  and  SOCBs, \nintensifying  banking  reforms,  improving  the  business \nenvironment, and introducing a regulatory body for infrastructure \nservices.  Second,  through  policy  actions  addressing  social \ninclusion  and  environmental  sustainability,  the  benefits  include \nimproved  quality  of  education  (especially  in  poor  areas), \navailability  of  medicines  at  affordable  prices,  secured  asset \nownership through the implementation of a new land law, and \nmore  sustainable  management  of  forests  and  improved \nenvironmental quality. Third, through policy actions addressing \nmodern governance, the benefits are increased transparency and \naccountability of public finances, and improved legal transparency \nand accessibility. These will be achieved through, among others, \nfinancial  disclosure  of  all  state  budget  entities,  piloting  of  the \nMedium-Term Expenditure Framework, and decentralizing public \ninvestment decisions to lower governments.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Three  potential  risks  are  associated  with  the  program  loan: \ncontainment  of  contingent  liability,  social  inclusion  and \nenvironment sustainability, and a fiduciary risk related to public \nfinancial management.  \n   \n  First, the ambitious economic growth target could be a source of \npressure to expand commercial and policy loans for infrastructure \ndevelopment especially at local levels, without proper appraisal. \nThe  overall  quality  of  lending  may  be  undermined  by  such \npressure, thereby undermining the banking reform agenda and \nleading to a build-up of contingent liabilities. This risk could be \naddressed  by  enhancing  the  credibility  of  government  policies \nregarding nonperforming loans and strengthening the commercial \norientation and autonomy of SOCBs with decisive policy actions. \nThrough the PRSC process, the Government has already decided \nto  adopt  loan  classification  based  on  international  accounting \nstandards. \n   \n ", "vi   \n  Second, some key service delivery programs are underfunded \neven though policies in health and education aim to target the \npoor and improve the quality of service delivery. While service \nproviders  were  given  incentives  to  charge  fees,  they  are  not \naccountable  to  provide  basic services  at  a  low  or  no  fee.  To \nprotect the environment, increasingly sophisticated legislation and \nits  implementation  are  still  needed  to  ensure  effective \nadministrative, economic, and information tools. This risk could be \naddressed  through  improvements  in  data  availability  and \nanalytical  work  on  issues  arising  from  rural-urban  disparities \nincluded as part of the PRSC process. Regarding environmental \nsustainability,  the  country  environmental  assessment  and  the \nPRSC policy actions on land, water, and environmental protection \nshould help mitigate risks. \n   \n  Third, while gains have been made in budget transparency and \nexecution, the management of state assets and liabilities will need \nmuch improvement. Concerns have been raised regarding the \nrapidly emerging and fast-growing provincial investment funds, \nwhich suffer limited transparency and accountability. While the \nGovernment is working toward effective anticorruption measures, \na rapidly growing economy and the opportunities for graft could \noutpace improvements and efforts in anticorruption policies. This \nrisk  could  be  addressed  by  initiatives  that  provide  effective \ncounter mechanisms. A comprehensive diagnostic of corruption \nand  its  modality  will  be  finalized  and  publicly  disclosed.  An \nanticorruption  law,  to  be  passed  by  the  National  Assembly  in \nNovember  2005,  will  introduce  stronger  accountability \nrequirements  for  heads  of  agencies,  monitoring  of  assets  of \nsenior government officials and their families, and introduction of \na  more  effective  whistle-blowing  mechanism.  The  Government \nhas  also  encouraged  the  media  to  apply  a  more  proactive \napproach in detecting and reporting corruption.  \n   \n  The  Government  is  aware  of  the  potential  risks.  Through \nappropriate  measures  and  proactive  programs  during  program \nimplementation, the Government will take into consideration risk-\nmitigating measures. ADB along with other PRSC cofinanciers \nhave  provided  technical  assistance  and  conducted  analytical \nstudies to help policymakers formulate and execute mitigating and \ncorrective measures in anticipation of these potential risks. \n \n \n \n ", " \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to Support the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction \nProgram II. The loan follows a program-based approach and is part of the Fourth Poverty \nReduction Support Credit (PRSC 4), jointly processed by several development partners, in \nsupport  of  the  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \n(CPRGS).1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n   \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  The Government is committed to poverty reduction. Poverty reduction is an overarching \nobjective in its national socioeconomic development process and is addressed in the 2002 \nPoverty Reduction Partnership Agreement2 with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and a \nseries of strategic plans and documents, including the CPRGS, the 5-Year Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Plan  (SEDP)  (2001-2005),3  and  the  10-Year  Socioeconomic  Development \nStrategy  (2001-2010).4  The  CPRGS  is  unique  and  widely  recognized  as  a  blueprint  for \ndevelopment.  Based  on  empirical  analysis  and  broad  consultation,  it  identifies  clear \ndevelopment  goals,  specifies  policies  to  attain  the  goals,  and  aligns  public  resources  to \nimplement these policies.     \n \nA.  Development Objectives, Strategies, and Plans \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s development strategy is embodied in the CPRGS. The CPRGS embraces \nthree broad pillars: Pillar I\u2014High growth through the transition to a market economy, which \nrequires implementation of an ambitious structural reform agenda; Pillar II\u2014Equitable, socially \ninclusive, and environmentally sustainable growth, which requires appropriate sector and social \npolicies and programs; and Pillar III\u2014Adoption of a modern public administration, and legal and \ngovernance system, which is essential for the first two goals to be attainable. The CPRGS \npillars are intertwined with crosscutting themes such as employment generation for poverty \nreduction, and the link between public financial management and effective delivery of social \nservices to the poor. Details on the CPRGS are given in Appendix 2.  \n \n4.  The Government is currently preparing a new 5-year SEDP (2006\u20132010), to be issued in \n2006. The new SEDP is expected to provide Viet Nam\u2019s new national strategy for poverty \nreduction and growth, incorporating the fundamentals of the CPRGS, 2002 development goals, \nand Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement with ADB. The SEDP has a target of 7.5\u20138.0% \nannual average gross domestic product (GDP) growth, elimination of hunger by 2010, and \nhalving of poverty from 29% in 2002. In response to public health scares, the Government is \ncontrolling  public  health  outbreaks,  including  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  and  avian  influenza,  with  special  strategies  and \nprograms supported by official development assistance (ODA) partners.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Inter-Ministerial Group of the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. 2002.

Viet Nam is making good progress in improving its policy environment. During 2003-\n2004, the National Assembly approved, among others, laws on land, bankruptcy, competition, \nand electricity. In 2005, it passed 15 laws in the first session, and plans to consider 14 other \nlaws  for  approval,  including  a  law  on  anticorruption  and  unified  laws  on  enterprises  and \ninvestments. In addition, the Civil Code amendment is expected to be approved in 2005. The \ncode will clarify rights and obligations of citizens, and facilitate private sector transactions. In \nApril  2005,  the  Government  hosted  the  Sixth  Steering  Committee  meeting  of  the  ADB\u2013\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development Anticorruption Initiative in Hanoi. It is \nimplementing the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Agreement; and it has \nbeen active in the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program activities with \nPrime Minister Phan Van Khai participating in the second Greater Mekong Subregion Leaders \nSummit in Kunming in July 2005. Viet Nam has advanced negotiations for its planned World \nTrade  Organization  (WTO)  accession  at  the  end  of  2005.  It  is  also  actively  pursuing \nimplementation  of  the  Development  Assistance  Committee  (Organization  for  Economic \nCooperation  and  Development)  Paris  Declaration  2005.  Preparations  for  holding  the  10th \nNational Party congress in the first quarter of 2006 are under way.  \n \nB.  Recent Economic Performance \n \n6.  In  the  past  decade,  Viet  Nam  has  experienced  both  high  economic  growth  and \nimpressive poverty reduction. This trend continues in spite of recent adverse shocks, including \nan  outbreak  of  avian  influenza;  severe  flood  and  droughts;  a  sharp  rise  in  key  imported \ncommodity prices; and the introduction of market barriers in textile, garments, and other export \nproducts. In spite of those adverse conditions, GDP has grown by more than 7% for the third \nconsecutive year (Table 1). The strong economic performance reflects the increasing strength \nand buoyancy of the private sector, as evident in buoyant private consumption and investment, \nand  fast  export  growth.  While  the  number  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  is  steadily \ndeclining, an additional 35,000 new businesses were registered in 2004, representing a year-\non-year increase of 26% in number and 24% in registered capital. Private sector industrial \nproduction rose 23% in 2004, compared with 12% for the state sector. Foreign direct investment \ncommitments reached a 7-year high of US$4.2 billion in 2004, or nearly 10% of GDP. Overall, \nhelped by high oil prices, exports grew by 29%, reaching 57% of GDP. Being a net oil exporter, \nViet Nam has benefited from high crude oil prices in the past couple of years. With its stable \npolitical  regime  and  robust  macroeconomic  fundamentals,  Viet  Nam  has  been  among  the \nworld\u2019s fastest growing economies in recent years. Along with the broad-based growth, the \nVietnamese population has enjoyed widespread improved living conditions. Results from the \n2004 Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey indicate that the number of people living in \npoverty has substantially declined since the 2002 survey. While a poverty rate cannot yet be \nreported  with  confidence,  sustained  progress  toward  the  attainment  of  the  Viet  Nam \nDevelopment Goals (VDGs) and other key development outcomes is expected.  \n \n7.  The  sectors  that  contributed  most  to  overall  economic  growth  were  industry  and \nservices, together accounting for nearly 80% of GDP. Industry expanded by 10.2% and the \nservices sectors by 7.4%, while agriculture grew at 2.8%, marking the slowest growing sector. \nThe consumer price index rose by 9.5% in December 2004 and annual average inflation was \nestimated at 7.7%, up from 3.2% in 2003. Broad money supply rose by 28% in 2004. Credit \ngrowth also accelerated to 42% in 2004, mainly after the inflationary peak. The credit growth \nraised concerns over the quality of lending. Since then, the Government has taken measures, \nincluding raising the reserve ratio and discount rate on refinancing of commercial banks, to \nreduce the credit growth rate in 2005 to 25-30%.

Sector Description and Performance \n1.  Progress with Reducing Poverty \n8.  Viet Nam has made impressive progress in social development and in reducing poverty \nduring the last decade. The achievements should be seen in the context of the experience of \nsome other transition economies where poverty reduced and social indicators deteriorated in \nthe initial stage of transition. Viet Nam halved poverty in about 10 years. The poverty rate \ndropped from 58.1% in 1993 to 37.4% in 1998, 28.9% in 2002, and 24.1% in 2004. However, \nthe rate of poverty reduction slowed in recent years, i.e., 4.8 percentage points during 2002\u2013\n2004 compared with 9 percentage points during 1998\u20132002.6 Poverty reduction is slow or \nunchanged in the northern mountains and in pockets of the Red River delta region and north \ncoastal region, contributing to regional disparities. The VDGs show a steady improvement in \nsocial indicators, such as school enrollment and infant mortality, and improvements in other \nhuman development indicators. Viet Nam ranks 112th of 177 countries in terms of the human \ndevelopment index, i.e., 0.691 in 2004,7 which is much lower than other countries in the region, \nbut ranks much higher at 41 in terms of the human poverty index.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

Although  Viet  Nam,  like  many  other  countries  in  the  region,  has  experienced  high \neconomic growth, income per capita is still low. With US$600 annual per capita income, Viet \nNam is still categorized as a \u201cleast income\u201d country.8 With around 24% of the population still \nliving below the poverty line, poverty remains a major concern for the Government. Social \ntension, lack of access to social services, demographic reasons like migration, land ownership, \ngender  and  ethnic  constraints,  and  environment-affected  risks  are  additional  obstacles  for \neconomic growth and the main reasons for people to return to poverty. Support for these people \nshould  come  on  time  and  be  delivered  effectively.  Thus,  a  careful  approach  (in  terms  of \nplanning and delivery) will be required to reduce poverty and to prevent the return to poverty. \nThis is reflected in CPRGS implementation.  \n \n10.  Poverty reduction efforts must (i) focus on high impact and sustainable poverty reduction \nprograms and projects (i.e., asset creating, infrastructure, and/or income-generating activities); \nand  (ii)  improve  opportunities  for  the  poor  to  access  market  facilities  and  social  services \nespecially  targeting  to  women,  children,  and  ethnic  groups  (i.e.,  creating  an  investment \nenvironment and strengthening market institutions, improving quality of services with effective \npolicies, decentralizing, and strengthening local public administration). Forests, water resources, \nand tourism/ecotourism should and can play an important role in moving and keeping these \ncommunities out of poverty. \n \n  2.   The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy  \n \n11.  In  May  2002,  Viet  Nam  embarked  on  CPRGS  implementation.  The  CPRGS  was \nprepared  with  support  of  the  development  assistance  community,  including  ADB,  and  in \nconsultation with stakeholders and civil society (Appendix 2 provides details). Implementation of \nthe policy reform agenda as stipulated in the CPRGS, has been largely through pooling of ODA \nresources, both grant and lending, under the PRSC framework, prepared by the development \npartners in close consultation with government agencies, and the Government\u2019s own resources. \nWith these supports, incorporation of the CPRGS into socioeconomic development plans has \nbeen conducted in more than 20 provinces to ensure the planning process captures CPRGS \nprinciples, which focus on poverty and social inclusion, results-based planning and monitoring, \nand  broad  consultation.  This  planning  reform  is  important  to  ensure  all  policy  actions  are \ncaptured  into  the  long-  and  medium-term  strategies  at  all  levels  and  sectors.  In  addition, \ndevelopment partners must align their country strategic plans with Government plans while \nmoving toward policy-based lending. Several development partners have jointly and actively \nconducted the formulation and review of PRSCs. The PRSC framework has gradually shifted \nfrom narrowly defined structural reform, such as the reform of state-owned commercial banks \n(SOCBs) and SOE sector to a broader and deeper policy reform agenda, encompassing the \nthree pillars of the CPRGS (para. 3). \n \n12.  The  Government  has  well-established  coordinating,  monitoring,  and  oversight \narrangements for poverty reduction programs funded by various ODA resources. The National \nSteering Committee, established in September 2002, is chaired by a deputy prime minister, with \na deputy governor of the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) as standing deputy chair. Its members \ncome from all concerned government ministries and agencies. The steering committee guides \nimplementation  of  CPRGS  poverty  reduction  programs  within  the  PRSC  framework.  The \nGovernment undertakes detailed reviews of implementation progress of the CPRGS reform \nagenda, and discusses findings and emerging issues with its development assistance partners, \nusually at the annual Consultative Group meeting. The Poverty Task Force meetings provide a \n                                                 \n8 The World Bank criterion for a least income country is US$765 annual per capita income for 2005. ", "              5  \n \nforum  to  review  and  discuss  emerging  issues  in  line  with  CPRGS  implementation.  These \nmeetings are usually cochaired by one aid representative and the Government. ADB, World \nBank, and Department for International Development (DFID) cochair the meetings on a rotating \nbasis.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n  1.   Problem and Constraints Analysis \n \n13.  Overall, CPRGS progress has been significant, but important structural issues and social \nchallenges need to be addressed. Regarding the transition to a market economy, the reform \nagenda has relied on restructuring the state sector, and not on massive divestiture. Important \nsteps have been undertaken, especially in terms of liberalizing trade and fostering competition. \nBut addressing hard budget constraints faced by the SOEs has proved more difficult. On the \nsocial side, regional disparities may widen as Viet Nam integrates with the world economy. Also, \nethnic minorities have benefited less from economic growth than the majority of the population. \nThe effective delivery of social services to the poor, especially for disadvantaged regions and \nethnic minorities, is essential to keep development inclusive. But reform of the social sectors \nrequires changes in their financing, and needs to be carefully sequenced and aligned with the \ndecentralization  process.  As  for  governance,  institutional  reform  lags  the  rapid  economic \ntransition, creating opportunities for abuse. The Government has recently taken measures to \nstrengthen the State Inspectorate and State Audit. An ambitious initiative to strengthen public \nfinancial management is under way. But considerable weaknesses persist in the selection of \npublic investment projects; in the integration of capital and recurrent expenditures; and in the \nsupervision of project implementation, especially at the local level. Weak financial management \nsystems  and  insufficient  transparency  create  the  risk  of  inefficiency  in  the  allocation  of \nresources, mismanagement, and corruption. \n \n14.  In 2003, major movements and initiatives were undertaken on a broad range of reforms, \nespecially in relation to integrating with the world economy, permitting public investment in large \nSOEs and SOCBs, and designing a new approach to fight corruption. The Government is \ncommitted to following these activities through as they promise to solidify and accelerate the \nneeded reforms. The Government is also committed to adopting a more decisive stance on \nbanking reform. As part of this, the Government will outline a clear separation of the functions of \nSBV  as  owner  of  commercial  banks  and  supervisor  of  the  system,  and  take  actions  to \nrestructure the SOCBs and improve their credit culture. The Government recognizes that for it to \nincrease lending from the ODA community, it will need to expedite implementation of its recent \ndecision on accession to WTO; increase private sector investment in large SOEs and SOCBs; \ntackle directed lending; and make progress on governance and public administration reforms, \nthe anticorruption agenda, as well as financial sector reform.  \n \n2.  Country Strategy and Program of the Asian Development Bank \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is based on three pillars: (i) pro-poor economic growth, \n(ii) social development, and (iii) good governance. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (2002-\n2004)9 emphasizes (i) generating economic growth and new employment through private sector \ndevelopment; (ii) improving governance and public administration; and (iii) paying attention to \nsocially inclusive development and focusing on the central region, where the incidence of \npoverty remains high.  \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2001. Country Strategy and Program: Viet Nam 2002\u20132004. Manila.  \n ", "6      \n \n16.  The  2003  joint  poverty  assessment  completed  by  the  Government  and  several \ndevelopment partners, including ADB,10 confirmed that economic growth continues to reduce \npoverty,  but  that  since  the  pace  of  poverty  reduction  is  slowing,  targeting  of  the  poor  is \nbecoming more necessary. At the same time, to deal successfully with the accelerating pace of \ninternational economic integration, Viet Nam needs to modernize its economy and institutions, \nand accelerate investment (to an estimated 35% of GDP). Faster growth, which is likely to \nbenefit the more advanced areas, will need to be accompanied by measures to distribute the \nbenefits of growth, including targeting of poor areas and groups. \n   \n  3.  Lessons Learned  \n \na.  Multiple-Tranche Program Loan \n17.  A special evaluation on program lending11 reported that since 1987 program loans have \ngenerally been limited to two tranches. The report suggested that uniform adherence to two-\ntranche program loans should be abandoned; and that multiple and floating tranches could be \neffective in providing flexibility in meeting policy change, preserving an incentive for policy \nchanges, and maintaining continuous engagement with a longer term outlook. \n \n18.  The proposed program loan uses an innovative approach of a single-tranche loan that is \nactually part of a continuum multiple-tranche program loan. Since all of the 15 policy actions \nincluded in the proposed program loan have already been achieved prior to loan approval, the \nloan proceeds will be disbursed as soon as the loan becomes effective. While this arrangement \nmay  on  the  surface  seem  overly  flexible,  the  PRSC  operation  is  outcome  oriented  with \nambitious but specific outcomes/targets set to be achieved in 5 years after the inception of the \nCPRGS.  To  identify  the  prior  conditions  for  each  annual  PRSC,  the  Government  and \ncofinanciers undergo several rounds of policy dialogue to discuss and select effective but \nfeasible  prior  actions  from  a  pool  of  many  more  policy  measures.  The  identification  and \nsequencing of a comprehensive medium-term reform agenda require strong analytical work. \nLessons learned from similar World Bank programs note the importance of conducting joint \nanalytical work between development partners and the Government, with wide consultation with \nacademia, and civil society. The development partners and academia can help the Government \nin terms of analytical tools and sharing of international experiences.  \n \n19.  The flexibility of the PRSC operations is evident in the expanding reform areas covered \nunder the last few PRSCs. In addition, the PRSC operations promote coordinated aid effort in \nassisting  Viet  Nam  under  an  overall  development  framework  as  evident  by  an  increasing \nnumber of PRSC cofinanciers. The identification and sequencing of a comprehensive reform \nagenda that covers a medium-term period requires strong analytical work. It is important to \nconduct joint analytical work between donors with wide consultation with academia and the civil \nsociety with the Government.  \n \n20.  The assessment of the first three PRSC programs showed that progress was achieved \nwithin most sectors, but with room for improvement, particularly for SOE and financial sector \nreform.  However,  Government  leaders  are  committed  to  accelerating  banking  reform.  This \nincludes a partial equitization of SOCBs and movement for SBV to focus entirely on monetary \n                                                 \n10 World Bank. 2003.

The National Assembly has been considering a large backlog of laws and \nregulations necessary for WTO accession. The acceleration in considering and passing those \nlaws and regulations would limit progress in passing laws in other areas.  \n \n    b.  Asian Development Bank Policy-Based Lending \n \n21.  Lessons from the experience of previous program loans and postevaluation studies are \nthat (i) continued ownership and commitment of government are fundamental to achieving \ndevelopment outcomes; (ii) monitoring and evaluation should be based on both process (inputs \nand outputs) and outcome indicators; (iii) outcome indicators will depend on successful follow-\non actions, as passage of a decree or law alone will not produce any meaningful results if the \nlaw  is  not  brought  into  effect  (which  will  require  regulations,  circulars,  etc.),  and  proper \nenforcement (which will require institutional capabilities); and (iv) sector or subsector-based \nprogram loans have limited scope to address economywide policy and institutional issues. \n \n4.  Justification for the Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit  \n \n22.  PRSC 4 aims to address three key areas of macro policy and institutional reforms for (i) \nsupporting  the  transition  to  a  market  economy  by  removing  structural  weaknesses  and \nimproving  the  business  environment,  (ii)  making  development  socially  inclusive  and \nenvironment friendly, and (iii) modernizing governance and the public administration system. \nPRSC 4 preparation was expected to build on the foundations of the existing strong ODA \ncommunity\u2019s commitment to support Viet Nam\u2019s reform agenda through nationwide CPRGS \nimplementation and galvanize interest for the reform program among stakeholders. Increasingly \ndevelopment partners have united around the PRSC as an instrument for policy dialogue. They \nhave already been actively involved in supporting implementation of the reform agenda, through \nanalytical work, technical assistance, project lending, and direct budget support. The PRSCs, \nincluding PRSC 4, fall in the last category. The rationale for direct budget support comes from \nthe external financing needs under the state budget. The policy actions supported by the PRSC \nprocess entail a substantial additional burden on the budget. Among these are recapitalization \nof SOCBs, operation of a safety net for workers who become redundant as a result of SOE \nrestructuring, expansion of budget appropriations for the education sector, and creation of \nprovincial health care funds for the poor.  \n \n23.  The justification for PRSC 4 is grounded on three criteria: (i) prudent macroeconomic \nmanagement to ensure that progress with the long-term reform agenda will not be undermined \nby short-term instability; (ii) the Government\u2019s own assessment of the progress accomplished in \nCPRGS implementation; and (iii) the need to meet the reform triggers (measures and actions) \nfor PRSC 4 (established with PRSC 3), except for unforeseen circumstances.   \n \n24.  The International Monetary Fund\u2019s assessment of Viet Nam\u2019s economic performance12 \nconfirms the country\u2019s solid macroeconomic performance in 2004, despite the adverse effects of \ndroughts and the outbreak of avian influenza. The Governments\u2019 progress report13 on CPRGS \nimplementation was presented to the Consultative Group meeting in December 2004. The \nreport highlights the accomplishments in reform implementation (e.g., opening of the economy, \nmore favorable investment climate, better public financial management, substantial poverty \nreduction,  and  attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals),  but  it  also  identifies \n                                                 \n12  Letter of assessment prepared by the International Monetary Fund to accompany PRSC 4, available on request. \n13  Government of Viet Nam. 2004.

The joint staff assessment of the CPRGS led by the \nWorld Bank and observations by other key development partners acknowledges the frankness \nin reporting and also notes the challenges. The assessment indicates that the progress across \nmost of the 15 triggers chosen for PRSC 4 preparation was generally satisfactory or highly \nsatisfactory with a few partially satisfactory. The progress of all triggers related to the first pillar \n(transition to a market economy) was either satisfactory or highly satisfactory. The progress of \nthe trigger related to the second pillar (social inclusion and environmental sustainability) was \nmostly satisfactory or highly satisfactory with one trigger on the water sector assessed as \npartially satisfactory. The progress of the third pillar (modern governance) was noted markedly \nuneven  in  relation  to  the  other  two  pillars.  Slow  progress  was  noted  for  public  financial \nmanagement and legal development reforms. \n \n5.  Rationale for the Proposed Program Loan \n \n25.  PRSC 4, which was jointly processed by major development partners including ADB, \ndeepens the reforms supported by PRSCs 1-3 and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. \nThe policy actions it endorses are all firmly rooted in the three pillars of the CPRGS. It identifies \nactions to support the unfinished reform agenda, including the preparations for WTO accession, \nopening  of  the  equity  capital  of  large  SOEs  and  SOCBs  to  private  investors,  progress  in \nplanning  processes  and  public  financial  management,  and  the  move  to  a  more  systemic \napproach to addressing corruption. In addition, the PRSC 4 policy agenda includes several \nmeasures  to  promote  socially  inclusive  economic  development.  These  are  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, country strategy and program for Viet Nam, and poverty \nreduction agreement with Viet Nam. \n \n26.  CPRGS  implementation  supported  by  the  PRSC  programs  is  expected  to  lead  to \nsubstantial improvements in development outcomes. The current PRSC-cycle covers 5 years, \nmuch the same as the CPRGS. While the reform program focuses on a set of strategic policy \nactions, its implementation should translate into improved economic and social indicators. The \npreparatory work for PRSC 4 commenced in late 2004. The identification of the policy actions \nneeded to attain the development outcomes spelled out in the CPRGS has been strongly \ninfluenced by analytical work. ADB and other development partners, including the International \nMonetary Fund14 are instrumental in providing factual information and analysis, thus contributing \nto the monitoring of progress in implementing reforms and sharing international good practices. \nThe  PRSC  process  has  been  supported  by  a  series  of  comprehensive  analytical  reports \ncovering the CPRGS\u2019s three pillars. The analytical work also helps the development partners \nand  the  Government  identify  the  PRSC  policy  actions  needed  to  attain  the  development \noutcomes outlined in the CPRGS. The annual Viet Nam development reports (VDRs), a joint \ndonor report to the Viet Nam Consultative Group meeting, provide crucial information and \nanalyses on focal issues relevant to the Government\u2019s reform agenda. VDR 2004, entitled \nPoverty,15  examined  issues  regarding  social  inclusion.  VDR  2005,  entitled  Governance,16 \n                                                 \n14 The International Monetary Fund\u2019s 3-year loan arrangement with Viet Nam under the Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth Facility expired in April 2004. However, the International Monetary Fund remains fully committed to \ncontinuing a partnership with the Government to support CPRGS implementation. It has contributed actively to the \nbroader dialogue between the Government and its development partners, and also provides the required letter of \nassessment for the PRSCs.  \n15 ADB, Australian\u2019s Government\u2019s Overseas Aid Program, DFID, German Agency for Technical Cooperation, JICA, \nSave the Children UK, United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. 2003.

And the forthcoming VDR 2006, entitled Business, will \nmainly deal with structural reforms. VDRs are prepared in partnership with PRSC cofinanciers \nincluding ADB, with substantive inputs from Vietnamese policymakers and academics.  \n \n27.  The ODA community has adopted the CPRGS as their reference document for planning \nexternal assistance for the country. The focus of these operations has gradually broadened to \ninclude all the essential pillars of poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth, and is \nincorporated in PRSC programs. The ODA community in Viet Nam considers the PRSC a useful \ninstrument in support of CPRGS implementation. In 2005, 10 major ODA partners, namely ADB, \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency,  Denmark,  European  Commission,  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, Ireland, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Netherlands, \nAgencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional, and United Kingdom\u2019s DFID are cofinancing \nPRSC 4 with the World Bank. All cofinanciers have participated in the preparation of PRSC 4, \nand have been actively involved in the policy areas where they are strong. Because many \ndevelopment agencies are active in Viet Nam, several cofinanciers are involved in the same \nreform sectors. However, when considering subsectors, certain cofinanciers may have more \ncomparative advantage than others. For example, for the financial sector, while the World Bank \nand Japan Bank for International Cooperation specialize on banking reform, ADB is specialized \non nonbanking reform. Through the ongoing Financial Sector Program loans I and II, ADB has \nassisted the Government in developing the capital market, insurance market, leasing sector, \nmoney market, secured transactions, and accounting and auditing system, and anti-money-\nlaundering regulation. ADB has participated in policy dialogue related to many reform sectors as \nit has a large portfolio of about US$2.0 billion, compared with the World Bank\u2019s portfolio of about \nUS$2.7 billion. Appendix 3 provides the aid coordination matrix. \n \n28.  ADB has promoted policy dialogue in Viet Nam on similar sector issues through its \nprogram lending activities (such as loans for the Agriculture Sector Program, Financial Sector \nProgram I, Public Administration Reform Program Cluster in 2003; and the Small- and Medium-\nSized Enterprise Development and Financial Sector Program II in 2004). PRSC 4, which has a \nnational economywide reform agenda, complements these ADB-assisted activities (Appendix 2, \nFigure A2.2). In addition, ADB staff have actively participated in PRSC policy dialogue with \nother cofinanciers, thus ensuring synergy between the PRSC\u2019s multisector policy actions and \nADB sector-based programs/projects. This allows ADB to verify that PRSC 4 conditions do not \nconflict with policy conditions under ADB\u2019s ongoing sector loans. In fact, ADB\u2019s participation in \nthis dialogue enables it to influence the reform agenda to complement ADB\u2019s ongoing sector \nloans. In other words, ADB\u2019s participation in the PRSC operations complements ADB\u2019s own \nsector programs, because the PRSC provides a clear picture of ADB\u2019s intervention as part of \nand in relation to the aggregated efforts of all Viet Nam\u2019s development partners. The proposed \nloan therefore would provide great leverage in aid coordination and formulation of the results-\nbased country strategy and program for Viet Nam.  \n       \n29.  As a multisector instrument covering a range of issues related to poverty reduction, the \nPRSC will provide ADB with an opportunity to (i) advance policy dialogue in a well-coordinated \nmanner with other relevant ODA partners of Viet Nam, and (ii) ensure that key policy issues for \nimplementation of ADB operations in Viet Nam are adequately considered and addressed in the \npolicy dialogue between the Government and the ODA community. The proposed program loan \n                                                                                                                                                          \n \n16 ADB, CIDA, Danish International Development Agency, DFID, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, \nSwedish International Development Agency, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, and the World Bank. 2004.

By participating in this multilateral cross-sector loan, ADB gained insight to permit fine-\ntuning of the sector-based loan. \n \n30.  To  reduce  transaction  costs  for  the  Government  and  the  participating  development \npartners in a rather complex operation, the proposed loan pursues a program-based approach. \nThis is in line with ADB\u2019s recent move and practices to adopting program-based and sector \napproaches in its lending operations to reduce transaction costs for its developing member \ncountries as well as for its own operations. The approach is not only consistent with ADB\u2019s \nreform agenda,17 Long-Term Strategic Framework,18 and Medium-Term Strategy,19 but also will \ndirectly help fulfill ADB\u2019s obligations to the Rome Declaration on harmonizing procedures of \nmultilateral  development  banks  (February  2003)  and  the  recent  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid \nEffectiveness (February\u2013March 2005). \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n31.  The  program  loan  aims  to  help  Viet  Nam  reduce  poverty  and  sustain  high-level \neconomic growth, as envisaged in the CPRGS. The outcome envisaged is to support the \nGovernment\u2019s Poverty Reduction Program under the policy framework of PRSC 4, together \nwith other development partners, with a focus on reducing structural weaknesses, promoting \nsocially inclusive development, and modernizing governance and public administration. To \nreduce poverty and sustain rapid economic growth, the program loan will strengthen Viet Nam\u2019s \nreform program on three main fronts: \n \n(i)  Promote  growth  and  create  employment  by  increasing  internal  and  external \ncompetition; accelerating the divestiture of SOEs and SOCBs; and improving \ntransparency and accountability in SOE operations, banking, and the financial \nsector. \n(ii)  Advance  human  development  by  increasing  the  budget  appropriation  for \neducation and increasing education standards; providing resources to cover the \nhealth care costs of the poor; developing mechanisms to complete the transfer of \nland-use rights to households, especially in upland and ethnic minority areas; \nand providing support measures to improve environmental and water resource \nmanagement.  \n(iii)  Increase transparency and accountability of public finances; promote simplified \nadministrative procedures, and work to decrease corruption as part of a broader \neffort  to  build  modern  governance;  and  revamp  the  planning  processes  by \nmoving away from a command approach to aligning policies and resources with \nthe attainment of well-specified development goals based on empirical analysis \nand wider consultations.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions\n32.  Preparatory work to formulate PRSC 4, aiming to support the Government with CPRGS \nimplementation, was initiated in September 2004 with the participation of key development \n                                                 \n17  President Chino\u2019s memo of 25 August 2004 entitled Today: Achieving Results Together.  \n18  Asian Development Bank. 2001.

SBV \ncoordinated the overall processing of PRSC 4 on behalf of the Government, while the World \nBank took the lead for the development partners (Appendix 2 provides summary details of the \nformulation of the program loan).  \n \n33.  The PRSC 4 policy framework includes both deepening and broadening reforms under \nthree  pillars:  (i)  transition  to  a  market  economy,  (ii)  social  inclusion  and  environmental \nsustainability, and (iii) modern governance. The policy matrix is presented in Appendix 4 and the \ndevelopment policy letter in Appendix 5.  \n \n1.  Pillar I: Transition to a Market Economy  \n \n34.  Under this pillar, PRSC 4 supports reform actions in areas such as trade integration, \nSOE reform, financial sector reform, and improving the business environment. Such reforms are \ncritical to maintain the momentum of high economic growth. The key thrusts in trade integration \nare Viet Nam\u2019s accession to WTO and harmonization of the legal environment pertaining to \ntrade  and  investments  in  the  integration  process.  Under  previous  PRSCs,  quantitative \nrestrictions on a number of imports were removed and a strategy for lowering tariffs adopted. \nViet Nam continues to make significant progress in the negotiations for WTO accession. In \nparallel with the negotiation process, related legislation is being formulated or revised. In March \n2005, the Prime Minister issued Decision 41 on regulations of import licensing consistent with \nWTO requirements. The Government also revised the Decree on Foreign Investment to abolish \nthe requirement that foreign invested companies must export as least 80% of their outputs.  \n \n35.  Viet Nam also committed to comply with WTO\u2019s Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement \nfrom the date of accession. As part of the commitment, a national phytosanitary notification \nbody and enquiry point was established under Decision 99 in May 2005. This is to facilitate \ncommunication both between Viet Nam and other countries and among government agencies. \nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is the focal agency in this process. An action \nplan is being developed to address phytosanitation, food safety, and agriculture health issues. \nThis aims to support the exploitation of new export opportunities in agriculture and fisheries, as \nwell as protect Viet Nam from cross-border, disease-related threats.   \n \n36.  The revised Customs Law, passed in May 2005, shifts the approach of the customs \nadministration from control to trade facilitation. In the past, customs documents were manually \nfilled and processed while goods were subject to physical inspection. This delayed goods \nclearance and raised the transaction cost. The new law introduces an electronic environment for \ninteractions between traders and customs, allows self-assessment of traders\u2019 liabilities, and \nfacilitates risk management techniques to minimize physical inspections.  \n \n37.  Restructuring  and  ownership  transformation  of  SOEs  constitute  a  major  component \nunder the PRSCs. The agenda for SOE reform is evolving with some progress. Equitization of \nSOEs  is  accelerating.  Positive  developments  include  the  Government\u2019s  determination  to \ndecrease  government  ownership  in  certain  sectors  and  to  facilitate  the  divestiture  or \nrestructuring of large enterprises. Decision 155/2004/QD-TTg reduced the list of sectors in \nwhich full state control is justified: 100% state ownership is now stipulated only for strategic \n                                                 \n20  Adapted from the jointly processed PRSC 4 report. \n ", "12      \nsectors such as explosives, national defense, printing of banknotes, national electricity grid, rail \nnetwork, and major ports. Decision 155 provides for equitization of electricity generation units, \nan area previously deemed strategic. A hydropower plant was equitized through auction in \nMarch 2005. An action plan for the equitization of another seven power plants was approved.  \n38.  The significance of Decision 155 extends beyond the equitization of large SOEs. In 2003 \nevery  line  ministry,  government  agency,  province,  and  general  corporation  drew  up  an \nequitization list defined according to the criteria in Decision 58.21 These were the so-called 104 \nrestructuring plans approved by the Prime Minister to serve as the basis for the equitization \nprocess over the following 3 years. The necessary revision of all these plans in light of Decision \n155 will lead to the divestiture of many more SOEs, including large ones. A preliminary count \nindicates that 736 SOEs will be added to the 2,400 already identified for equitization, sale, or \nliquidation in the so-called 104 restructuring plans. Also SOEs whose equitization plans have \nbeen approved are being reexamined as the proportion of shares to be sold may now increase. \n39.  The Government also issued Decree 153 in August 2004 to convert large groupings of \nSOEs, currently organized under the form of a general corporation, into holding companies. The \nholding company model was recommended by a series of operational reviews, and promises to \nimprove corporate governance of general corporations. The conversion of general corporations \ninto holding companies should greatly strengthen their management. As defined in Decree 153, \na holding company in Viet Nam is not a large entity involved in a wide variety of industries. \nConverting into a holding company involves the corporatization of entities whose activities are \nlargely  restricted  to  one  sector.  The  general  corporation  structure  of  Viet  Nam  is  unique. \nGeneral corporations do not control the SOEs in their clusters through ownership of equity in the \nmanner that conventional limited liability companies own their subsidiaries. This has resulted in \nsuboptimal performance of general corporations in terms of their ability to drive sector growth \nand  competitiveness.  Decree  153  is  designed  so  that  a  \u201cmother\u201d  general  corporation  can \nexercise  appropriate  management  control  over  its  \u201cchildren\u201d  companies.  In  the  future,  this \nstructure rationalization should make equitization of whole general corporations, including their \nchildren companies, easier.  \n40.  Decree  187  also  introduced  key  changes  on  conversion  of  SOEs  into  joint  stock \ncompanies, as of 16 November 2004, to facilitate the equitization process, whereby valuations \nmust be conducted by outside agencies, the ability of strategic investors and other outsiders to \nbuy shares has been extended, the shares themselves are to be sold through auctions, and \nincentives for linkage between equitization and listing are enhanced. Decree 187 defines the \nresponsibilities of SOE managers in financial settlement, and stipulates the transfer of assets \nand debts not included in enterprise valuation to the Debt and Assets Trading Company. The \ntwo sources of subsidies for retrenched SOE workers include (i) the redundant workers fund, \nand (ii) the SOE equitization support fund. The Ministry of Finance manages both funds. The \ndecree stipulates that a proportion of equitization proceeds must be contributed to the funds. \nThe redundant workers are eligible for retraining and the redundancy allowances.22 The decree \nmandates  the  employment  of  outside  agencies  to  carry  out  valuations,  and  makes  land \nvaluation consistent with the new Land Law. It extends the ability of strategic investors and \nother outsiders to buy shares, and links share prices to market value determined by auctions. \n                                                 \n21 On 26 April 2002 the Prime Minister issued Decision 58/2002/QD-TTg issuing criteria for classifying SOEs and \ngeneral corporations and a list of sectors where the state must retain 100% ownership or more than 50% \nownership. Based on the list of sectors and the criteria, line ministries and local authorities formulated a list of \nSOEs to be equitized that do not fall into the categories in Decision 58. \n22  The redundant workers\u2019 pension fund is managed by an independent agency, namely the Viet Nam Social \nSecurity. ", "              13  \n \nThe  decree  also  provides  clearer  guidelines  on  how  sales  proceeds  are  to  be  used:  for \nseverance benefits, to support retraining, and transfer of the remaining funds to the Ministry of \nFinance.  \n41.  The PRSC includes banking reform as a core component. Restructuring SOCBs to \nimprove  their  financial  health  and  operational  efficiency  is  imperative  to  sustain  economic \ngrowth especially as the financial sector is mostly bank-based, through which most investments \nare financed. As the sector is more liberalized in light of WTO accession, strengthening bank \nsupervision  should  be  on  the  top  of  the  banking  reform  agenda.  Under  PRSC  4,  SBV \nannounced separation of SBV\u2019s management of SOCBs from its supervision functions. This \nannouncement is based on inputs prepared for the Banking Development Strategy up to 2010. \nThe strategy was submitted to the Government, which is expected to endorse most if not all of \nit. Through a separate document, the Government has confirmed the noncontroversial aspects \nof this submission. They include the development of new laws on SBV and credit institutions, to \nbe passed in 2008 based on WTO requirements and Basel core principles. This document also \nenvisages the transformation of the SBV into a modern central bank, charged with the conduct \nof market-based monetary policy and financial sector supervision. The commercial orientation \nand autonomy of SOCBs is another key objective of the reform. The equitization of all SOCBs is \nseen as an important step in that direction.  \n42.  As the banking reform proceeds, an assessment of the asset quality of banks is needed. \nThis is important to provide for substandard assets and to develop a realistic plan to address \nnonperforming  loans  (NPLs).  In  April  2005,  SBV  promulgated  Decision  492  on  asset \nclassification  and  loan-loss  provisioning  for  banks  in  line  with  international  practices.  The \nregulation includes a mandatory classification of debt based on repayment status into five \ncategories,  with  associated  specific  provisioning  ratios.  Banks  will  also  have  to  apply  a \nqualitative risk-based classification of debts using internal credit-rating systems, which need to \nbe approved by SBV. Initially banks will have the option to defer the qualitative risk-based \nclassification, but they must have implemented it after 3 years. The regulation represents a \nsignificant improvement over the use of Vietnamese accounting standards and will enhance the \noverall evaluation of asset quality in the banks, as well as ensure appropriate provisioning for \npotential losses. All banks will have to produce their first reports based on the new classification \nby June 2005, and submit the corresponding NPL resolution plans shortly after. SBV provided a \npreliminary  estimate  of  NPLs,  based  on  the  new  regulation.  The  estimate  is  in  line  with \nindependent audits of the SOCBs using international accounting standards.   \n43.  Along with the measures to address financial aspects of the banking reform, PRSC 4 \nalso supported the strengthening of banking practices and operations. Adoption of the credit \nmanual  and  loan  computerization  are  among  the  measures  taken.  This  helps  banks  to \nstandardize their credit policy and procedures, and to enhance the efficiency of lending activities \nand portfolio monitoring. Banks are also required to establish internal audit committees to \nimprove accountability and governance.  \n44.  The Government, for the first time, established an anti-money-laundering regime through \nissuance  of  Decree  74  on  June  2005.  The  decree  requires  suspicious  transactions  to  be \nrecorded and tracked. Financial institutions are obligated to set an internal procedure for the \nprevention  of  money  laundering.  An  information  center  for  anti-money  laundering  will  be \nestablished within SBV to receive and process information and reports on individuals and \norganizations that perform suspicious financial transactions. Interim measures to combat money \nlaundering include suspension of transactions, freezing the account, and temporary seizure of \nassets. The decree specifies the responsibilities of the SBV, Ministry of Public Security, and \n ", "14      \nother relevant ministries in tracking and dealing with money-laundering activities. It also defines \nthe mechanism for international cooperation to fight money laundering. The Government is also \nproceeding to become a member of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering. \n \n45.  Decree 28, issued on 9 March 2005, sets out a framework for establishment, operation, \nand regulation of microfinance institutions. Despite some restrictions with regard to geographic \noperation coverage and range of services, the decree represents a significant step forward in \nrecognizing microfinance operations and improving their outreach and governance. To date, this \narea has not had any formal regulation despite the existence of a wide variety of organizations \nthat provide financial services. Decree 28 defines microfinance institutions and licensing criteria; \nand provides for supervision of the institutions based on specific parameters in areas such as \ncapital,  corporate  governance,  and  business  plans.  The  supervision  of  the  microfinance \ninstitutions is not as strict as for banks as the institutions are much smaller in scale and \ntherefore should not have to contend with the relatively complex regulations that apply to banks. \n \n46.  Improving  the  business  environment  for  the  private  sector  has  presented  the  most \nremarkable and persistent achievement of Viet Nam over the last 5 years. The streamlined \nbusiness  registration  procedures  have  led  to  a  significantly  increased  number  of  new \nenterprises\u201427,700 enterprises with the registered capital of D58 trillion in 2003 and 37,230 \nenterprises with the registered capital of D76 trillion in 2004. Under PRSC 4, progress is being \nmade to enhance the environment for private sector development. The National Assembly \npassed the Competition Law in December 2004, which serves as a governing framework for fair \ncompetition. Open competition will apply to all sectors and types of enterprises including SOEs. \nUnder the open competition policy, private enterprises will be protected against anticompetition \nacts from dominant public sector competitors, and enterprise monopolies are discouraged. A \ncompetition commission will be established under the law. Effective implementation of the law \nand independent operation of the competition commission are critical to ensure fair market \naccess and competition \n \n47.  In infrastructure, the Electricity Law passed by the National Assembly in November 2004 \nwill  facilitate  restructuring  of  the  power  sector,  including  the  separation  of  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution. It will allow for greater diversity of ownership and financing of \npower sector assets, as well as create the conditions for greater competition in power sector \ngeneration and supply markets in the longer term. The law foresees the establishment of an \nelectricity  regulator  to  ensure  more  transparent  oversight  of  existing  operators  and  new \noperators; as well as to evaluate electricity tariffs, investment, quality of service, and operation. \n \n2.  Pillar II: Social Inclusion and Environmental Sustainability \n \n48.  Issues related to social inclusion and environmental sustainability include policy actions \nin education, health, water, and environment. For education, concern for quality has taken \npriority as strategies to improve access and equity are being implemented. A standards-based \napproach is being employed to upgrade quality. The fundamental school quality standards for \nprimary schools have been adopted nationwide. They refer to physical infrastructure, teaching \nstaff,  school  organization  and  management,  social  participation  in  education,  educational \nactivities and quality, and expected educational outcomes. A survey covering all districts was \nconducted to audit the current situation relative to the standards. Typically, schools in poorer \nzones fall far short. To ensure equity, poorer zones are given priority in upgrading quality. \n \n49.  Low teaching skills and content knowledge are major constraints for enhancing student \nachievement, as demonstrated by a recent study of academic performance at the end of the ", "              15  \n \nprimary school cycle. These constraints are being addressed through the introduction of a clear \nteacher profile as an assessment tool to improve teaching competencies, to guide professional \ndevelopment, and to set up a remuneration-related grading system. The teacher profile consists \nof three dimensions (attitudes, knowledge, and pedagogical skill) defined through four levels of \ncompetency  (beginning,  regular,  senior,  and  lead).  The  profile  has  been  refined  through \nstakeholder consultation and a trial application with 2,200 teachers. By now 25,000 primary \nschool teachers (or 7% of the total) have been evaluated against the new profile. \n50.  Recent legal changes will promote and safeguard poor people\u2019s access to forestland \nand forest resources as a source of livelihood. State forestry enterprises currently control 40% \nof the 11 million hectares of land classified as forested, which are often located in the poorest \nparts  of  the  country.  State  forestry  enterprises  generally  have  contracted  out  all  forest \nmanagement  activities  to  local  households.  But  because  tenure  security  is  weak  and \narrangements lack clarity, the local population benefits only marginally from forestry activities. A \nclear separation between the public service provision role of state forestry enterprises and their \nbusiness activities is needed to improve the well-being of those whose livelihoods depend on \nforestland and to enhance conservation. Decree 200/2004/ND-CP on the restructuring of state \nforestry enterprises provides criteria for their transformation into either commercially viable \nwood businesses or effective public service entities, in particular, for forest protection. In the \nprocess, land use certificates (LUCs) for the remaining underused land and scattered forestland \nwill  be  transferred  to  households,  communities,  and  other  users,  including  private  sector \nenterprises. \n51.  The revised Law on Forest Protection and Development, approved by the National \nAssembly in November 2004, provides the overall framework for the move to more social and \ncommunity-based forestry. For the first time, it recognizes the forest use right of households, \ncommunities, and other sectors, as well as their ownership of plantation forest. It provides a \nframework for multiple uses of the vast areas of protection forest in the uplands, and exploitation \nrights in these areas, which could lead to new management systems combining protection with \nproduction.  The  law  provides  terms  and  conditions  for  the  leasing  of  production  forest  to \neconomic units including farm households, and proposes to assign an economic value to each \nforest production area as the basis for its allocation or lease. In parallel, key stakeholders have \nstarted the consultation process to revise the Forest Sector Strategy, which is expected to \nproduce a long-term broad positive impact not only on poverty reduction but also on sustainable \nmanagement of forest, land, water, and environment in upland areas. \n52.  The foundations for an effective set of policies, tools and incentives for environmental \nprotection  are  being  laid  out.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  development  over  the  last  decade  has  created \nsustainability challenges that are not appropriately addressed by the existing legislation. The \namendments to the Law on Environmental Protection, submitted to the National Assembly in \nMay 2005, should lead to improvements in two main areas. First, they clarify line ministries\u2019 \nresponsibilities for environmental protection, and decentralize responsibilities within the Ministry \nof Natural Resources and Environment to its local and regional departments. Second, they \nenable  new  policy  tools  and  remedies  for  various  environmental  issues  such  as  pollution \nprevention and cleanup, adjustments to cover the private sector, improvements in financial \nmechanisms  for  environmental  protection,  and  initiatives  for  raising  public  awareness  and \nsupport for environmental protection. \n53.  Guidelines for the implementation of the Land Law represent a key step in strengthening \nland registration and land valuation. Under the new law, the limitations previously imposed on \ndistricts and provincial governments for their authorities to issue LUCs have been abolished. A \n ", "16      \nunified system of land administration agencies is also to be set up. Decree 181/2004/ND-CP \ncovers these aspects. It also addresses zoning issues, with the requirement that provinces \nsubmit their complete land-use plans in 2005. The recalling of unused or inappropriately used \nland  is  assigned  to  provincial  People's  Committees.  Decree  188/2004/ND-CP  provides \nguidelines in the crucial area of valuation, serving as the basis to calculate taxes on LUC \ntransfers, and to set the value of LUCs and rents when the government decides to lease or \nallocate land to businesses. The system will also be used to define the value of LUCs for \ncompensation claims when the government withdraws land. The new valuation system is much \nmore flexible than the previous one and will be adjusted in accordance with changing market \nvalues. The previous mechanism often fixed land prices at much lower rates than their market \nvalue, resulting in residents being reluctant to move out of construction areas because of low \nresettlement packages. \n  3.  Pillar III: Modern Governance \n \n54.  The focus of this reform pillar is on improving the planning process, public financial \nmanagement,  delivery  of  public  administration  services  to  people  and  businesses,  and \nanticorruption initiatives. The CPRGS approach is more integrated into the 5-year SEDP at \nnational and local levels. The Prime Minister recently issued Directive 33/2004/CT-TTg to guide \nthe preparation of the 5-year SEDP for 2006\u20132010. The last planning period (2001\u20132005) \ninvolved the production of both a SEDP and the CRPGS. The CPRGS was described as an \naction plan for the SEDP by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and accepted as a \npoverty reduction strategy by the international development community. The Prime Minister\u2019s \ninstructions state that these two planning instruments\u2014which have differed in both approach \nand substance\u2014will be merged in the coming plan period. The CPRGS has not had the same \ncentral role in directing government activities but has pioneered some new approaches to \nsocioeconomic planning, both in terms of process and substance. The SEDP takes most of the \nCPRGS  important  principles,  with  a  result  that  consultations  for  planning  this  SEDP  were \nbroader, involving groups outside of government including local organizations and some poor \ncommunities. The process has involved three main activities: (i) regional workshops to discuss \nthe approach and its implications for sector and local planning processes, (ii) community and \nlocal  consultation,  (iii)  other  stakeholder  workshops,  and  (iv)  an  international  consultation \nworkshop. The SEDP also has a stronger analytical framework for growth and poverty reduction \nuses of a wider range of credible data mechanisms to monitor progress, framed around VDGs \n(localized versions of the Millennium Development Goals); some of the participatory approaches \nto planning were emulated; and achievement of strategic outcomes\u2014rather than production \ntargets\u2014motivates the policy measures and public actions identified for the SEDP.  \n \n55.  Implementation  of  the  CPRGS  over  the  past  2  years  has  been  \u2019rolled  out,\u2019  i.e., \ndecentralized, with more ownership of MPI and local government line ministries. The roll-out \nwas started with 32 subnational governments. With collaborative MPI-province-aid activities \nunder way in 18 provinces, supported by 10 funding agencies, skills are being built to enable \nnational and subnational governments to adjust to a more bottom-up style of planning. This will \nbe important over the next year as provincial authorities seek to implement the Prime Minister\u2019s \ndirective for a more participatory, evidence-based, and bottom-up planning process. These \nchanges  locate  the  responsibility  for  identifying  strategic  actions  for  growth  and  poverty \nreduction  where  much  of  the  responsibilities  for  allocating  public  resources  are  provincial. \nExperience  with  the  CPRGS  implementation  has  been  mixed.  At  a  recent  meeting  of  the \nPoverty Task Force,23 representatives from the more advanced provinces described a planning \n                                                 \n23  Poverty Task Force meeting in Hanoi, October 2004 and April 2005. ", "              17  \n \nrenovation process that incorporates a more strategic thinking, results-oriented and participatory \napproach. Some provinces have already organized training courses to prepare officials in those \nareas. However, planning reform that changes the whole mindset, skills, and approach away \nfrom more centrally directed approaches is challenging. Thus, MPI proposed to expand the roll-\nout process in all provinces and cities based on the experience and lessons learned, which \nidentified the need for more attention to capacity building. This will be important and essential \nfor maintaining momentum. \n \n56.  The preparation of the 2006\u20132010 SEDP provides an opportunity to strengthen national \nand provincial planning. Directive 33 instructs that CPRGS principles be incorporated into the \nSEDP. Not only does this bode well for modernizing national planning, but it holds promise for \nprovincial plans. Over the last 2 years, 20 provinces have experimented with preparing strategic \nplans, in the context of an aid-supported initiative to implement the CPRGS at subnational \nlevels. Based on the experience and lessons learned from the ongoing process, MPI has \nproposed to scale up the roll-out process in all provinces and cities in Viet Nam. Because of the \nongoing decentralization process, local governments will play an increasingly important role in \nattaining national development goals. Roughly half of budget spending is now under the control \nof provinces, districts, and communes. The success of decentralization, and the ability to keep \ndevelopment inclusive, will crucially depend on the ability of local governments to embrace \nstrategic  planning,  leading  to  sound  policy  choices,  supported  by  commensurate  budget \nallocations, and monitored through an appropriate set of provincial development indicators. \n57.  Disclosure requirements for the state budget at all levels, as well as for entities using \nstate budget resources, have been considerably strengthened. The regulation is applicable to \nfunds financed by state budget resources, such as the Development Assistance Fund, Viet Nam \nSocial Security, provincial investment funds, SOEs, and organizations financed by contributions \nfrom the public. Under the regulation, allocation norms approved by the National Assembly and \nthe People\u2019s Councils must be publicized at each budget level. Organizations funded from the \nstate budget must disclose their state budget support, budget plans and final accounts, and \nmethods used to determine their state budget support. For state capital investment projects, \nannual budget allocations, budget plans, final accounts, and bidding results for procurement \nmust  be  disclosed.  Funds  financed  by  the  state  budget  must  make  public  their  charters, \nfinancial  arrangements,  annual  financial  plan,  and  operational  performance.  For  SOEs, \nmandatory disclosure includes their financial position, operational performance, provision for \nand use of welfare funds, remittances to the state budget, per employee income, and return on \nstate  equity.  Methods  of  disclosure  include  announcements  at  public  meetings,  printed \ndocuments, posting at offices and websites, and publicity through the mass media. Ministries \nand  provincial  People\u2019s  Committees  are  responsible  for  monitoring  compliance  of  their \nsubordinate bodies. The normal requirement for responses to questions regarding disclosures is \nwithin 10 days. \n58.  The launching of a comprehensive assessment of the fiscal risks associated with SOEs, \nSOCBs, and the Development Assistance Fund signals the Government\u2019s intention to venture \ninto more active management of assets and liabilities. Much of the focus has been on estimating \nthe share of NPLs in the portfolios of commercial banks and policy-lending institutions. A \nsomewhat implicit assumption is that the delinquent debtors, most of them SOEs, do not have \nthe ability to repay their debts. However, not servicing the debts is not the same as not making \nprofits. More importantly, most of the delinquent SOEs are occupying prime land, whose sale or \nlease could be an important source of revenue. \n ", "18      \n59.  The newly acquired independence of the State Audit of Viet Nam (SAV), which is now an \nagency established under the National Assembly, is a milestone for transparency. The SAV law \napproved in May 2005, gives the National Assembly the authority to appoint, and if necessary to \ndismiss, the auditor general. SAV reports that have been approved by the National Assembly \nwill be publicly disclosed through several channels, including the official gazette, the SAV \nwebsite, and mass media. This is in sharp contrast with the situation that prevailed previously, \nwhen audit findings were not made public except with government authorization. In this context \nof increased transparency, the audit of SBV financial statements for 2003 was launched in April \n2004,  and  the  Government  intends  to  submit  a  copy  of  the  audit  report  to  the  National \nAssembly. \n60.  The move to increase transparency is reflected in the emerging approach to fighting \ncorruption. The appointment of the Government Inspectorate as the leading agency for the \npreparation  of  a  new  anticorruption  strategy  has  been  associated  with  an  invitation  to \ndevelopment agencies to cooperate with its implementation. Previous efforts to curb corruption \nfocused on punitive measures, rather than on rigorous diagnoses and systemic remedies. \nLaunching the first comprehensive study on the modalities and mechanisms of corruption in Viet \nNam took years, with little information about this study being filtered to outsiders. In sharp \ncontrast, the findings of pilot surveys in seven cities are being brought to the mid-2005 informal \nConsultative Group meeting for discussion with development partners, jointly with a framework \nto ask for support with key components of the emerging anticorruption approach. A call to the \nmedia to be more proactive in the investigation and reporting of corrupt acts suggests that \ntransparency is seen as an important component of the new approach. \n61.  The  criteria  for  measuring  poverty  have  been  brought  into  line  with  international \nstandards. Based on the recommendations of a task force led by the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, \nand Social Affairs and the General Statistics Office (GSO), an expenditure-based poverty line \nwill be estimated using GSO\u2019s Viet Nam household living standards survey. The poverty line \ncomprises a food component, which is the value of a typical basket of food items in Viet Nam \nproviding 2,100 calories per person per day, and a nonfood component. The latter is the value \nof a set of basic nonfood items that are typically consumed by people whose food expenditures \nare around the food poverty line. The earlier method combined a participatory approach with a \nrudimentary survey to estimate household incomes of those generally considered poor. The \nparticipatory approach consists of village consultations to classify households according to their \npoverty status. While this method accurately identified the poorest of the poor households it did \nnot  necessarily  identify  all  the  poor.  The  methodology  was  inconsistently  applied  across \nprovinces and was subject to manipulation by provinces who wished to report faster progress. \nC.  Important Features \n62.  A social and poverty impact assessment was undertaken in relation to the program loan \n(a  summary  is  in  Appendix  6  and  additional  details  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A).  The \nassessment concludes that the activities will have no adverse impacts on indigenous people or \nhave gender implications. The loan will not involve land acquisition and/or resettlement.  \n63.  An environmental assessment of the potential environmental impacts associated with \nthe program loan policy matrix is available in Supplementary Appendix B. The assessment \nreveals that most policy reforms will produce positive impacts on urban and rural environments. \nMost  reforms  aimed  to  improve  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency.  While  not \nspecifically designed for environmental protection, these reforms tend to promote optimal and \nefficient  use  of  resources,  including  natural  resources.  Some  reforms  aim  to  improve ", "              19  \n \nenvironmental protection and management; and some aim to improve health and education, \nwhich tend to have indirect positive impacts on environmental sustainability. These reforms fit \nwell with Viet Nam\u2019s environmental policy needs, and are therefore considered practical and \nnecessary next steps for the nation\u2019s environmental management framework.  \n64.  Some  policy  reforms  will  likely  have  no  impact  on  the  environment.  These  include \nreforms related to public financial management and financial sector reform. These could have a \npositive  \u201ctrickle-down\u201d  effect.  The  reforms  related  to  trade  integration,  private  sector \ndevelopment, and SOE reform may cause indirect negative impacts if they lead to pressure on \nthe environment and natural resources due to increased economic activities. The links between \nsuch  indirect  positive  and  negative  impacts  cannot  easily  be  evaluated  or  monitored.  No \nenvironmental impact assessment has been conduced to evaluate the policy implications of the \nViet Nam\u2019s WTO accession and the CPRGS.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n65.  Policy measures supported by PRSC 4, such as the safety net for redundant SOE \nworkers, restructuring of SOCBs, or the creation of provincial program Health Care for the Poor, \nrequire  additional  spending.  These  are  costly  and  PRSC-specific  programs.  The  cost  of \nadjustment of the PRSC is therefore greater than the cost of these four items. While total \ngovernment revenue is increasing from US$10.5 billion in 2004 to US$11.3 billion in 2005, the \ntotal budget expenditure is increasing even faster from US$13.3 billion in 2004 to US$15.2 \nbillion in 2005. The financing needs are increased from US$1.5 billion in 2004 to US$2.1 billion \nin 2005. The external financing needs for 2005 (including grants) is estimated at US$1.4 billion, \nresulted from the financing needs less revenue carried over from 2004 and domestic borrowing. \nThe cost estimate for financing requirements for PRSC activities includes the cost of some \nspecific  PRSC-related  programs  and  the  external  financing  need  of  US$1.4  billion.  The \nestimated costs of some specific PRSC-related programs for the 2005 budget add up to about \nUS$770  million,  i.e.,  (i)  health  funds  for  the  poor\u2014about  US$90  million  due  to  expanded \ncoverage of beneficiaries according to the new poverty definition; (ii) increased spending on \neducation proportional to the Government budget\u2014about US$400 million; and (iii) social safety \nnet program for the retrenched SOE workers that covers more than 50,000 workers\u2014at least \nUS$80  million;  and  (iv)  resolution  of  nonperforming  loans  and  other  related  costs\u2014about \nUS$200 million. \n \nE.   Financing Plan \n \n66.  ODA  resources  of  approximately  US$225  million  are  expected  to  fund  PRSC  4 \noperations, led by the World Bank, which has already approved a US$100 million credit from the \nInternational Development Association to support PRSC 4. Three other cofinanciers will provide \nsupport in the form of concessional loans in parallel, namely ADB (US$15 million), Japan Bank \nfor  International  Cooperation  (US$22.8  million  equivalent  loan),  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (\u20ac10 million). The remaining seven cofinanciers will contribute financial support \nas  grants,  channeling  the  fund  to  the  multi-aid  trust  fund.  These  donors  include  Agencia \nEspa\u00f1ola  de  Cooperaci\u00f3n  Internacional  (\u20ac2  million),  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency (Can$6.0 million), Denmark (US$10.8 million equivalent), European Commission (\u20ac8 \nmillion), Ireland (\u20ac1.5 million), Netherlands (\u20ac8 million), and DFID (\u20a420 million). \n \n67.  The Government has requested a loan of US$15 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources as ADB\u2019s support to CPRGS implementation of the following policy framework of \n ", "20      \nPRSC 4 program. The program loan would contribute to financing the cost of adjustment \nresulting from implementing the policy matrix, particularly the prior actions for PRSC 4, and to \nsupporting  and  facilitating  the  Government\u2019s  continued  and  deepened  reform  program  for \npoverty reduction. The loan will be disbursed upon declaration of loan effectiveness. \n \n68.  The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan proceeds may be used to finance \neligible imports incurred within 180 days prior to the date of loan effectiveness. The loan closing \ndate will be 31 December 2006. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n69.  SBV will be the Executing Agency. The program is being implemented through 24 line \nministries and government agencies in accordance with the Loan Agreement. The ODA fund \nraised through the PRSC process and providing resources to the state budget to implement the \nreforms,  and  the  PRSC  operations  serve  as  effective  coordination  devices  between  the \nGovernment and large number of cofinancers. On behalf of the Government, SBV coordinated \nthe  overall processing of  PRSC  4,  while  the World  Bank  coordinated  the  process  for  the \ndevelopment partners. The number of cofinanciers has been continuously increasing\u2014from four \nin the case of PRSC 1 approved in 2002 to 10 for PRSC 4. The cofinancers have participated in \nthe PRSC process by forming working groups with the Government, which cover all economic \npolicy  areas.  ADB,  DFID,  and  World  Bank  rotate  as  cochairs  of  the  Poverty  Working \nGroup/Poverty Task Force with MPI. Staff of the ADB resident mission actively participate in \nseveral other working groups including Partnership to Support the National Target Program, Viet \nNam Business Forum, People\u2019s Participation Working Group, and Public Administrative Reform \nPartnership.  Given  the  comprehensive  nature  of  the  PRSC  reform  process  and  the  ever-\ngrowing number of cofinanciers, in January 2005 SBV established the Program Coordination \nUnit,  which  is  comprised  of  competent  staff.  It  deals  with  the  program  agenda,  including \nmonitoring  and  reporting,  awareness  raising,  capacity  building,  and  reform  outcome \ndissemination. The unit has frequently interacted with the World Bank and the cofinanciers of \nPRSC 4, including ADB. \n \n70.  The National Steering Committee for implementation of the CPRGS and PRSCs is led \nby the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reforms, and consists of representatives \nfrom  relevant  line  ministries  and  government  agencies.  SBV  is  assigned  as  the  agency \nresponsible, in close collaboration with the World Bank, for preparing and implementing the \nPRSCs.  An  SBV  deputy  governor  acts  as  standing  vice  chair  of  the  National  Steering \nCommittee.  This  quasi-advisory  body  has  several  representatives  from  key  ministries \nrepresenting the policy reform areas under PRSC 4 and subsequent PRSCs. Among the goals \nof the interministerial working group is subnational implementation of the CPRGS. The CPRGS \nSecretariat  at  MPI  supports  provincial  governments  in  adapting  the  CPRGS  to  their  own \ncontext, and reformulating plans and budgets accordingly. Several provinces24 have already \nstarted implementing pilot projects to (i) build capacity of provincial officials on new planning \nmethods, and (ii) form working groups to carry out policy dialogue. At present, more than 20 \nprovinces are going through this process, with financial support from development partners.  \n                                                 \n24  Ten pilot projects are being implemented in 10 provinces, of which 5 projects are administered by the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural Development and the other five by the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment.   ", "              21  \n \n \n71.  PRSC operations have been cofinanced by several bilateral and multilateral agencies, \neither through grants or parallel lending. The role of cofinanciers has been transformed from \nproviders of finance to reform partners. Cofinanciers have collectively and substantially engaged \nin the preparation of the operations and the policy dialogue with government. The dialogue is \norganized by policy areas, in which development partners engage selectively, based on their \ninterests and technical capacity.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n72.  The program period will be from 30 June 2005 to 31 December 2006. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n73.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding \nineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loan, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to Viet \nNam as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, if during each year \nthat loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Viet Nam\u2019s total imports minus \nimports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official \ndevelopment assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be \ndisbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with \neach withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be \nrequired. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification \n \n4.  Disbursement Arrangements \n74.  The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche, contingent upon loan effectiveness. The \nloan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to a negative list of \nineligible items (Appendix 7). Loan proceeds will be disbursed on the basis of a certification \nprovided by the Government that the value of total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember \ncountries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed under other ODA, is equal to or greater \nthan the amount expected to be disbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower's certification. As such, the \nprocedures for procurement and disbursement of funds, and the user of counterpart funds are \nfelt to be satisfactory.   \n \n75.  Various measures have been taken to ensure that the overall fiduciary policies and \ninstitutions are adequate to proceed with support from the proposed program lending. The \nanalytical underpinnings for the operation are largely complete: (i) the crosscutting assessment \nof  the  country\u2019s  development  policies  (social,  structural,  and  sectoral)  covering  the  policy \nreforms and institutional development priorities for sustainable growth and poverty reduction has \nbeen discussed with the Government in a number of recent joint reports; (ii) an assessment of \nthe country financial accountability arrangements has been made in the World Bank\u2019s following \nassessments:  Public  Expenditure  Review-Integrated  Fiduciary  Assessment  (PER-IFA),  the \nCountry  Financial  Accountability  Assessment,  and  the  Country  Procurement  Assessment \nReview. In addition, the implementation arrangements adopted for the loan have been effective. \nThe Country Financial Accountability Assessment (5 October 2001) concluded that the public \n ", "22      \nfinancial management system then represented some level of fiduciary risk. However, since \n2001  many  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment  recommendations  have  been \nimplemented, or are in the process of being implemented. The PER-IFA (May 2005) reviewed \nthe accounting and reporting process in the public sector, the oversight functions in the public \nsector, and financial reporting and auditing in SOEs. The PER-IFA recognizes recent changes \nto improve transparency and accountability, including the new Audit Law passed by the National \nAssembly in May 2005. This law will significantly enhance oversight by the National Assembly \nand the provincial People\u2019s Councils over public finances and substantially increase public \naccess to information on government finances. SBV\u2019s data management, financial reporting, \nand internal control system are also expected to be improved through a planned World Bank \nInternational Development Association credit in 2006. The implementation of the Treasury and \nBudget Management Information System to support establishment of an integrated financial \nmanagement system is expected to improve financial management in the public sector. The \nPER-IFA  identifies,  however,  a  large  agenda  for  improvement.  The  key  areas  include \nstrengthening SAV effectiveness, streamlining the internal control framework, and adopting \ninternational  public  sector  accounting  standards.  Implementation  of  the  PER-IFA \nrecommendations is being supported by the PRSC program and other World Bank grant funds. \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n76.  The Government will prepare and provide semiannual progress reports on the program \nloan. ADB will participate in all joint assessments by the Government and development partners \non  the  outcomes  of  PRSC  4  and  PRSC  5  triggers  (measures  and  actions).  Details  are \npresented the program framework in Appendix 1. \n \n6.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n77.  Viet Nam continues to make good use of information and analysis in its policy making \nand development of individual components of the PRSC program. PRSC 4 continues to build on \nthis experience, streamlining the numerous ongoing monitoring and evaluation initiatives. Key \nsources of monitoring information for poverty and program outcomes include the proposed \nbiannual household living standard survey, periodic participatory poverty assessments, small \nbusiness registration survey, public expenditure tracking survey, as well as quarterly progress \nreports from the relevant sector ministries and committees implementing the reform program.  \n \n78.  Efforts for national and provincial implementation of the CPRGS rely on the development \nof appropriate monitoring indicators. Gradually, the number of indicators for monitoring the \nCPRGS, including monitoring development outcomes for VDGs, has been narrowed to around \n140,  of  which  40  were  proposed  to  provinces  to  choose.  These  narrower  indicators  were \nmerged with 285 indicators of the national statistical system collected by GSO, which are partly \ngenerated by the household living standard surveys. The recent survey in 2004 by GSO will \nprovide information for many indicators in the system. However, despite the efforts to refine the \nindicator system, line ministries do not agree on about 47 indicators and GSO considers 16 as \nunknown.25 The indicators for monitoring the SEDP have not been specified as integration of the \nCPRGS into the SEDP is in progress. In that context, for monitoring arrangements, ADB, World \nBank, and UNDP are doing some joint work to strengthen monitoring system for the CPRGS \nand SEDP, which will give definite results to monitor outcomes of the PRSCs.  \n                                                 \n25 TA 4612-VIE (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Results-based \nMonitoring of Poverty Reduction and Growth. Manila) UNDP has also been implementing a US$1.6-million project \nfor strengthening capacity of statistical system. ", "              23  \n \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n79.  The proposed program loan will benefit Vietnamese people and businesses in three \nfronts. First, through policy actions addressing transition to a market economy, the benefits \ninclude increased efficiency, rapid economic growth, and job creation. The reforms under this \npillar aim to move the economy toward greater competition and faster integration with the world \neconomy. This entails policy actions aimed at gaining accession to WTO, accelerating the \ndivestiture of SOEs and SOCBs, adopting a more determined approach to banking reform, \nimproving the business environment, and introducing the regulatory bodies for infrastructure \nservices.  Second,  through  policy  actions  addressing  social  inclusion  and  environmental \nsustainability, the benefits include improved quality of education (especially in poor areas), \navailability  of  medicines  at  affordable  prices,  secured  asset  ownership  through  the \nimplementation  of  the  new  Land  Law,  and  more  sustainable  management  of  forests  and \nimproved environmental quality. Third, through policy actions addressing modern governance, \nthe benefits are increased transparency and accountability of public finances, and improved \nlegal  transparency  and  accessibility.  These  were  to  be  achieved  through,  among  others, \nfinancial disclosure of all state budget entities, independence of the State Audit, increased \neffectiveness of anticorruption actions, and improved information systems especially in relation \nto poverty measurement and targeting, piloting of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, \nand decentralized public investment decisions to lower levels of government.  \n \n80.  Three potential risks are associated with the proposed program loan: containment of \ncontingent liability, social inclusion and environment sustainability, and a fiduciary risk related to \npublic financial management. First, the ambitious economic growth target could be a source of \npressure to expand commercial and policy loans for infrastructure development especially in the \nlocal levels, without proper appraisal. The overall quality of lending may be undermined by such \npressure,  thereby  undermining  the  banking  reform  agenda  and  leading  to  a  build-up  of \ncontingent liabilities. Second, some key service delivery programs are underfunded even though \npolicies in health and education aim to target the poor and improve the quality of service \ndelivery. While service providers were given incentives to charge fees, they are not accountable \nto provide basic services at low or no fee. To protect the environment, increasingly sophisticated \nlegislation and its implementation are needed to ensure effective administrative, economic, and \ninformation tools. Third, while gains have been made in budget transparency and execution, the \nmanagement of state assets and liabilities will need much improvement. Concerns have been \nraised regarding the rapidly emerging and fast-growing provincial investment funds, which suffer \nlimited  transparency  and  accountability.  While  the  Government  is  working  toward  effective \nanticorruption measures, a rapid growing economy and the opportunities for graft could outpace \nimprovements and efforts in anticorruption policies. \n \n81.  The Government is aware of the potential risks. Through appropriate measures and \nproactive  programs  during  the  program  implementation,  the  Government  will  take  into \nconsideration risk-mitigating measures. ADB along with other PRSC cofinanciers have provided \ntechnical  assistance  and  conducted  analytical  studies  to  help  policymakers  formulate  and \nexecute mitigating and corrective measures in anticipation of these potential risks. The risk \nrelated to growing contingent liabilities could be addressed by enhancing the credibility of \ngovernment  policies  regarding  nonperforming  loans,  and  strengthening  the  commercial \norientation and autonomy of SOCBs with decisive policy actions. Through the PRSC process, \nthe  Government  decided  to  adopt  a  loan  classification  based  on  international  accounting \nstandards. The second risk related to social inclusion and environmental sustainability could be \naddressed through improvements in data availability and analytical work on issues arising from \n ", "24      \nrural-urban  disparities  included  as  part  of  the  PRSC  process.  Regarding  environment \nsustainability, the country environmental assessment and the PRSC policy actions on land, \nwater, and environmental protection should help mitigate the risk. Finally, the fiduciary risk \nrelated to public financial management caused by uncontrollable corruption could be addressed \nby  initiatives  that  provide  effective  counter  mechanisms.  A  comprehensive  diagnostic  of \ncorruption and its modality will be finalized and publicly disclosed. An anticorruption law, to be \npassed by the National Assembly in November 2005, will introduce stronger accountability \nrequirements for heads of agencies, monitoring of assets of senior government officials and \ntheir families, and introduction of a more effective whistle-blowing mechanism. The Government \nhas also encouraged the media to apply more proactive approaches in detecting and reporting \non corruption issues.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n82.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the State Bank of Viet Nam \nhave given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The  measures  and  actions  included  in  the  program  and  specified  in  the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and the policy matrices will continue to be in effect for \nthe sustainability of the poverty reduction program under the CPRGS and PRSC \nframeworks; and \n(ii)  Adequate and timely counterpart funds will be available for the implementation of \nthe poverty reduction program under PRSC 4. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n83.

The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy  \n \n1.  Evolution of the Strategy \n \n1.  The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS)1 is the outcome of \nextensive  discussions,  stakeholder  consultations,  and  review  work  undertaken  by  the \nGovernment, working closely with development agencies through the Poverty Task Force. The \nformulation of the CPRGS was coordinated by the CPRGS Secretariat based in the Ministry of \nPlanning  and  Investment  and  supported  by  several  official  development  assistance  (ODA) \npartners, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n2.  The CPRGS, approved by the Prime Minister in May 2002, translated the vision of a market \neconomy with a socialist orientation presented in the Ten-Year Socioeconomic Development \nStrategy for 2001\u20132010 into concrete public actions. Unlike previous planning documents, the \nCPRGS is focused and clearly defines development targets, identifies appropriate policies to \nattain those targets, and aligns resources to those policies. The country\u2019s development goals, \nwhich are a local version of the Millennium Development Goals, are among the key targets \npursued in the CPRGS (Table A2). In 2003, the CPRGS was expanded, with a thorough \ndiscussion of the role of large infrastructure in promoting economic and social development. \n \n3.  The CPRGS provides a framework for poverty reduction policies, programs, and actions \n(Figure A2.1). The ODA community has adopted the CPRGS as the reference document for \nplanning and formulating external assistance.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Inter-Ministerial  Working  Group  of  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy.  2002.

The  policy  actions  supported  through  the  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Credit  (PRSC) \nprocess can be seen as a distillation of the CPRGS and other development strategies and \nplans. The PRSC policy actions aimed to identify a coherent sequence of key measures in each \narea  over  the  medium  term.  The  identification  of  the  policy  actions  needed  to  attain  the \ndevelopment  outcomes  spelled  out  in  the  CPRGS  is  strongly  influenced  by  the  CPRSG \nprogress reports, funding agencies\u2019 analytical work carried out in recent years. The annual Viet \nNam Development Reports have played a very important role in this respect. These reports are \nprepared in partnership by the World Bank and other development partners, including ADB. In \naddition  to  these  CPRGS-PRSC-related  studies  and  reports,  sector  work  reports  and \nassessments done under sector-based programs/projects of each development partner provide \ninput to ensure the complementary and efficiency of the PRSC reform agenda. Figure A2.2 \nbelow illustrates the timing and relation of the strategy, implementation, analyses, and sector \nwork.  \n \n3.  Implementation and Monitoring  \n \n5.  Formulation of policy reforms and programs under the CPRGS involves many ministries \nand is coordinated by the National Steering Committee. The committee is led by the deputy \nprime minister in charge of economic reforms, and comprises representatives from relevant line \nministries and government agencies. The State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) is assigned as the \nagency  responsible,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  World  Bank,  for  preparation  and \nimplementation of PRSCs. A deputy governor of SBV acts as standing vice chair of the National \nSteering Committee. This quasi-advisory body has several representatives from key ministries \nrepresenting the policy reform areas under PRSC 4 and subsequent PRSCs. Among the goals \nof the interministerial working group is subnational implementation of the CPRGS. The CPRGS \nSecretariat at Ministry of Planning and Investment supports provincial governments in adapting \nthe CPRGS to their own context, and reformulating plans and budgets accordingly. Several \nprovinces2 have already started implementing pilot projects to (i) build capacity of provincial \nofficials on new planning methods, and (ii) form working groups to carry out policy dialogue. At \npresent, more than 20 provinces are going through this process, with financial support from \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n6.  SBV is responsible for formulating and implementing the PRSCs. To improve consultation \nand coordination with all stakeholders and to promote public discussion of the PRSCs, given the \ncomprehensive  nature  of  the  PRSC  reform  process  and  the  ever-growing  number  of \ncofinanciers,  in  January  2005  SBV  established  a  program  coordination  unit,  comprising \ncompetent  staff.  This  unit  deals  with  program  agenda,  including  monitoring  and  reporting, \nawareness  raising,  capacity  building,  and  reform  outcome  dissemination.  The  unit  has \nfrequently interacted with the World Bank and the cofinanciers of PRSC 4, including ADB. The \ndevelopment partners have participated in the PRSC process by forming working groups with \nthe  Government,  including  all  economic  policy  areas.  ADB,  Department  for  International \nDevelopment, and the World Bank rotate to cochair the Poverty Working Group/Poverty Task \nForce with the Ministry of Planning and Investment.

The Government \npresents its annual CPRGS progress report in December at the Consultative Group meeting. \n \n4.  Financing \n \n7.

The remaining seven cofinanciers will contribute financial support \nas grants. They include Agencia Espa\u00f1ole de Cooperaci\u00f3n International (\u20ac2 million), Canadian \nInternational Development Agency (Can$6.0 million), Denmark (US$10.8 million equivalent), \nEuropean Commission (\u20ac8 million), Ireland (\u20ac1.5 million), Netherlands (\u20ac8 million), and the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (\u20a420 million). \n \n5.  Progress with Implementation \n \n8.  The Government has steadily pursued its reform agenda. It recently completed the first \nannual  progress  report  on  growth  and  reduction  of  poverty  for  2003\u20132004.  The  CPRGS \nprogress report was presented at the midterm Consultative Group meeting in June 2005 and \nindicated that implementation of the reform agenda was on schedule. Although considerable \nprogress in the transition to a market economy has been achieved, the Government recognizes \nthat to keep development inclusive and to modernize governance, important challenges remain. \nKey recommendations of the CPRGS progress report include (i) improving the coordination \n \nbetween the ministries, agencies, and provincial governments for CPRGS implementation; (ii) \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  the  ministries,  agencies,  and  provincial  governments  in  the \npreparation  of  their  respective  5-year  plans  (2006\u20132010)  linking  with  the  CPRGS;  (iii) \nstrengthening data collection and analysis for plan implementation, monitoring, and evaluation; \n(iv) continuing to integrate the targets and policies of the strategy in the 5-year socioeconomic \ndevelopment  plan  (SEDP)  (2006\u20132010)  and  the  annual  development  plan  2006;  (v) \nstrengthening the participation of the community/population in the planning, monitoring, and \nevaluation of the SEDP; (vi) designing the handbook on integrating the CPRGS in the SEDP; \nand (vii) strengthening resource mobilization for implementing the objectives and targets of the \ndevelopment plan. The Government presented the Viet Nam Report 2005 on Implementation of \nthe Millennium Development Goals and Vietnam development goals. This report is still in the \nprocess of generating comments from various stakeholders, including development partners. In \nSeptember 2005 this report will be presented at the United Nations in New York. It is a laudable \neffort of the Government to finalize this specific report. \n \n9.  Over  the  last  12  months,  the  Government  has  adopted  many  substantive  actions  for \nimplementing its socioeconomic reform agenda. It has taken steps for trade liberalization in \npursuit of World Trade Organization (WTO) accession and integration with the world economy. \nThe Government has substantially accelerated the pace of ownership transformation of state-\nowned  enterprises,  improved  the  transparency  and  accountability  in  the  financial  sector, \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \nstrengthened  the  regulatory  framework  for  policy  lending  by  the  Government,  encouraged \ncompetition  in  telecommunications,  and  unified  corporate  tax  rates.  Several  initiatives  are \ncurrently under way to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Finance to exercise the state\u2019s \nshareholders rights. A production of more reliable data on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and \nstate-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) is much needed. \n \n10.  In  respect  of  social  inclusion  and  environmental  sustainability,  Viet  Nam  has  ensured \nappropriate budget allocation for education and for contribution to the provincial health funds for \nthe poor; raised the quality standards of primary education, and adopted a multisector action \nprogram  to  implement  its  national  human  immunodeficiency  syndrome/acquired \nimmunodeficiency  virus  (HIV/AIDS)  strategy.  To  improve  environmental  management,  the \nGovernment has implemented the polluter pays principle, issued regulations to handle the worst \npollution  offenders,  and  strengthened  the  environmental  assessment  capacity  of  local \nadministrations. The new Land Law\u2014effective 1 July 2004\u2014supports access to land for all \nsectors  and  recognizes  community  land-use  practices\u2014an  important  issue  for  upland  and \nethnic minority areas.  \n \n11.  To  build  modern  governance,  the  Government  has  taken  measures  to  increase \ntransparency in public finances, improve financial accountability, and ensure dissemination of its \nlegal documents and consultation with stakeholders. It continues to move forward on public \nadministration reform by simplifying administrative procedures using the one-stop shop model. It \nhas taken steps to strengthen the public procurement process, and to curb abuses in business \ntransactions. The Government intends to integrate the CPRGS approach into future 5-year and \n1-year planning processes. A series of consultations on the SEDP (2006\u20132010) was conducted \nin more than 10 provinces (ongoing and planned including Ben Tre, Cao Bang, Gia Lai, Hoa \nBinh,  Ninh  Binh,  Ninh  Thuan,  Quang  Tri,  and  Thua  Thien-Hue).  Preliminary  results  are \nencouraging since the quality of inputs/community feedbacks as well as the sense of ownership \nis  highly  appreciated  by  the  different  stakeholders  (i.e.,  provincial  governments,  agencies, \nprivate sector, and especially different groups of the communities). \n \nB.  Socioeconomic Performance and Key Policy Issues  \n \n12.  The overall assessment of the Government shows that economic growth has only nearly \nreached the planned targets but productivity is still low. Contribution to growth mainly comes \nfrom capital and labor. Though scientific and technological factors have been promoted, they \nonly account for a small proportion. The current quality of development is shown in three \naspects: economically, the competitiveness of products as well as the whole economy is still \nlimited and weak; socially, social advances are not parallel to economic growth, social evils still \nprevail, social morality worsens, corruption has become more serious; environmentally, the \nenvironment has been badly polluted and ruined, as no effective solution has been found. \n \n13.  While  the  Government  has  had  great  success  in  reducing  poverty,  regional  income \ndisparity remains a concern. The recent DFID Vietnam Inequality Report 2005: Assessment and \nPolicy Choices (June 2005) provides new insights and directions for pro-poor and pro-equity \ngrowth. Key \u201cdrivers of inequality\u201d such as state-sector bias, urban bias, secondary education \nbottleneck, limited access to safety nets, gender bias, multiple reinforcing vulnerabilities of \nethnic minorities, and corruption will provide inputs for the formulation process of the SEDP \n(2006\u20132010). Coastal development and further urbanization should cater to the employment \nneeds of the surplus labor coming from rural areas. This should also take into account possible \nrestructuring and modernization of the agriculture sector. \n ", "Appendix 2                39 \n14.  Agriculture  continues  to  develop.  The  production  value  of  agriculture,  forestry,  and \nfisheries, on average, has increased by 5.4% for the past 5 years, higher than the planned \ntarget  of  4.8%.  The  production  value  of  agriculture  increased  by  4.0%,  forestry  by  1.3%, \nfisheries by 10.7%. The average added value of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries is 3.6% (the \ntarget is from 4.0% to 4.3%). Agricultural production has moved in the direction of producing \ngoods with higher quality and value, which is responsive to market demands. However as in the \npast,  agriculture  sector  growth  resulted  from  (i)  reliance  on  higher  input  use  (labor,  land, \nfertilizer, tractors, and irrigation); (ii) policy reforms for land, markets, and trade; and (iii) high \npublic investment, mainly in irrigation and roads. This strategy will not likely be able to sustain \ngrowth in the future because (i) the potential for expanding the rural labor force and land under \ncultivation is limited; (ii) new investment in irrigation exhibits decreasing marginal returns, as the \nstock of irrigation capital is already very high and requires increased operation and maintenance \nrather than new expansion; and (iii) net revenue from rice export is declining. Viet Nam is \nalready  experiencing  overproduction  of  rice,  coffee,  and  other  commodities,  and  declining \nexport revenues from unprocessed primary commodities. \n  \n15.  The Government has made a good progress in specializing in a number of agriculture and \nfishery products (e.g., coffee, shrimps, catfish) and by taking advantage of increased market \naccess to regional and international high-income countries. However, predominantly traditional \nfarming practices that produce relatively low-value crops are holding back further success. \nAdvanced agriculture technology needs to be developed and disseminated. Agribusinesses and \nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises need to be developed for agroprocessing to increase \nadded value. Credit delivery to farmers needs to be improved, with consideration for introducing \ncrop and livestock insurance schemes in collaboration with the private sector or by promoting a \nfull-fledged microfinance system. \n \n16.  Carefully planned and efficiently managed large infrastructure projects such as seaports, \nairports, power plants, and national railways and roads properly linked with feeder roads can \nactively contribute to national socioeconomic development, as well as regional and international \neconomic integration. Nationally and subregionally they help (i) strengthen linkages between \npoor and developed regions; (ii) provide access to socioeconomic opportunities as well as \npublic  services;  (iii)  create  conditions  for  exploiting  local  resources  for  meeting  national, \nregional, and international demands; (iv) improve connectivity between people and businesses; \nand (v) eventually facilitate transformation of economic structures toward industrialization.  \n \n17.  The Government has emphasized the importance of large infrastructure development in the \ncontext  of  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Infrastructure  development  also  has  a \nsubregional dimension, whereby the potential demand from neighboring countries/subregions \nshould be taken into account. Development of large infrastructure will require large capital \ninvestments.

This could adversely affect economic competitiveness, \nresult in productivity losses due to pollution-related health problems in the workforce, and \nreduce the welfare and quality of life of the people. The Prime Minister approved the National \nStrategy for Environmental Protection until 2010 and Vision towards 2020 on 2 December 2003. \nThe strategy outlines the rapid deterioration of the environment and offers 36 priority programs \nto  strengthen  environmental  protection  through  the  expected  future  of  continued  rapid \nindustrialization and modernization. Viet Nam\u2019s Agenda 21 was approved in August 2004, and a \nnew, expanded environmental protection law is expected to be approved in 2005.  \n \n19.  To achieve efficient management of its development process and poverty reduction, the \nGovernment  should  ensure  (i)  transparency  and  accountability  of  central  as  well  as  local \nbudget/spending; (ii) proper accounting and auditing of public revenue and expenditure; (iii) \nsimplification and harmonization of internal central and provincial procedures; (iv) accelerated \nimplementation  of  public  administration  reform  (including  computerization  of  state \nadministration, and training of civil servants to build local capacity/capabilities); and (v) regular \nmonitoring and evaluation of development projects, involving beneficiaries and civil society.   \n \n20.  The  Government  is  preparing  a  new  5-year  SEDP  (2006\u20132010).  The  plan  will  be \nfundamentally different from the past 5-year plans. The next plan will anticipate further opening \nof the economy through implementation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nFree Trade Area; bilateral agreements with the European Union, Japan, and the United States; \nand WTO commitments. This will result in increased access to regional and global markets, and \nincreased external competitive pressure (through imports) for domestic suppliers, which may \nresult in short-term adjustment costs affecting mainly poor households. A major thrust of the \nnext 5-year plan should be on removing development weaknesses and exploiting the country\u2019s \nopportunities and strengths. \n  \n21.  On the macroeconomic front, prudence is required to ensure stability and sustain high \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. The Government should aim to achieve economic \ngrowth  from  (i)  more  efficient  utilization  of  existing  stock  of  capital  (i.e.,  improving \ncompetitiveness by removing inefficiencies, and maximizing capacity utilization in productive \nsectors);  and  (ii)  efficient  allocation  and  use  of  new  capital  investments  (i.e.,  health  and \neducation, infrastructure development, modernization and restructuring of agriculture, industry, \nand service sectors). New investments should ideally be maintained around 35% of the gross \ndomestic product, above this level may mean excess money supply leading to high inflation and \nother  associated  problems  as  the  economy  may  have  difficulty  absorbing  that  extent  of \nadditional capital deployment. \n \n22.  On the social front, income disparity, both geographic and demographic, will increase if \neconomic growth is not socially inclusive, and policy loopholes and weak governance continue. \nReducing poverty for the remaining 29% of the population will become increasingly difficult. \nODA (i.e., grants and soft loans) should be targeted at developing remote areas and reducing \nchronic poverty. The implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area and WTO commitments \n(assuming successful WTO accession in 2005) should be carefully planned and monitored to \nmitigate likely social costs. \n \n23.  The Government has indicated that the next 5-year plan will be integrated with the CPRGS \nand the master program for public administration reform (2001\u20132010). This would mean (i) \nintegrating CPRGS strategic and process elements into socioeconomic development planning, \nand (ii) strengthening public administration to efficiently implement Government policies and \nprovide public services to people and businesses.

During the Country Programming Mission of ADB (15 April\u20134 May 2005), the Government \nformally asked ADB to provide financing for implementation of the CPRGS,4 under the multi-\ndevelopment  partner  assisted  PRSC  4  led  by  the  World  Bank.5  ADB,  recognizing  the \nimportance of this request and the Government\u2019s commitment to poverty reduction, responded \npositively. Subsequently, the proposed program loan was considered \u201cfirm\u201d for 2004 in the \nCountry Strategy and Program Update 2005,6 and endorsed by the ADB Board of Directors on \n30 August 2004.   \n \n25.  Preparatory  work  to  formulate  PRSC  4  was  initiated  in  September  2004  with  the \ninvolvement  of  key  development  partners  and  government  agencies.  ADB  was  invited  to \nparticipate in the formulation of PRSC 4, including in the policy discussions and negotiations \nwith the Government. On behalf of the Government, SBV coordinated the overall processing of \nPRSC 4. For the development partners, the formulation process was led by the World Bank. \n2.  The Program Loan Proposal Formulation Process \n \n26.  From the outset, the Government and the ADB mission recognized the very tight timetable \nwithin which the ADB loan proposal had to be prepared, and the need to ensure that the \nprogram loan proposal be conceived as substantive, credible, and defensible. From the ADB \nperspective, for a program loan proposal, the Government had to (i) demonstrate commitment \nand support at all government levels, and (ii) facilitate the fullest possible participation by all key \nstakeholders during the formulation and implementation of the program loan. These two crucial \nconditions were accomplished during PRSC 4 processing. \n   \n27.  The Fact-Finding Mission from 15 April\u20134 May 2005, used the diagnostic work on the \nissues and challenges that the Government is seeking to address in PRSC 4 under the CPRGS \nframework.  The  mission  identified  the  policy  and  institutional  measures,  actions,  and \nimplementation arrangements necessary to ensure effective CPRGS implementation utilizing \nODA  funding.  The  mission  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  and  other \ndevelopment partners on the objectives, scope, financing, and implementation arrangements for \nthe proposed loan. The Government proposed that the processing of the loan follow simplified \nprocedures since ADB was one of the key development partners that had participated in the \npreparation of the CPRGS and formulation of PRSC 4; PRSC 4 has already been approved by \nthe Government and the World Bank, and the Government would follow simplified procedures \nfor its internal processing and approval.  \n \n28.  To  reduce  transaction  costs  for  the  Government  and  ADB,  the  mission  pursued  the \npossibility of applying a program-based approach in close consultation with ADB\u2019s Strategy and \nPolicy Department. This approach is in line with ADB\u2019s recent move to adopt program-based \n                                                 \n4  Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2003.

The \nGovernment has been continuously formulating and implementing this economic reform agenda \nas  described  in  a  series  of  Government  strategies  and  plans.  The  most  comprehensive \nsummary of the reform agenda is presented in the Ten-Year Socio-Economic Development \nStrategy (2001-2010). Key planning documents for the period covered by the ongoing cycle of \nPoverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) are the Five-Year Socio-Economic Development \nPlan  (SEDP)  2001-2005  and  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \n(CPRGS). The CPRGS was formulated and adopted in 2002 to concretize the reform agenda \nand reaffirm its commitment to poverty reduction; this was the same year that the Government \nsigned a poverty reduction partnership agreement with ADB. In 2003, the CPRGS was also \nexpanded to include a development policy for large-scale infrastructure. \n \nThe Government\u2019s reform program envisions a path of transition towards a market economy \nwith  socialist  orientation,  while  achieving  the  twin  goals  of  high  economic  growth  and \nsubstantive poverty reduction. The CPRGS was prepared with the assistance of the donor \ncommunity, including the ADB, and in consultation with stakeholders and civil society. The \nCPRGS has been used as an action plan for achieving the envisioned goals. The CPRGS spells \nout clear development targets, identifies appropriate policies to attain those targets, and seeks \nto align resources to those policies. The Viet Nam Development Goals, which are Vietnam's \nversion of the Millennium Development Goals, are among the targets of the CPRGS. The \npolicies  considered  encompass  three  main  areas:  high  growth  through  completion  of  the \ntransition to a market economy; an equitable, socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable \npattern of growth; and the modernization of governance systems.  \n \nWe view this ADB assistance (the program loan) as being supportive of the Government\u2019s entire \npoverty reduction and growth strategy and ensuing PRSC reform agenda, which is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, and Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement with \nViet Nam. ADB\u2019s assistance will contribute towards financing the cost of adjustment resulting \nfrom PRSC 4 policy matrix. To date this program has been supported by Poverty Reduction \nSupport Credits (PRSCs) from the International Development Association with co-financing from \nother bilateral and multilateral donors. The policy actions under the proposed program loan \nreflect the reform directions set out in our planning documents and in the CPRGS in particular. ", "Appendix 5                51 \nThe actions supported by the proposed program loan also reflect the emerging reform agenda \nfor the next planning cycle, when the CPRGS approach will be fully integrated in the five-year \nSEDP 2006-2010. The integration will require a broad consultation with stakeholders within the \nGovernment agencies as well as civil and donor communities. Key agendas of the consultation \nwill include both the attainment of development outcomes such as the Viet Nam Development \nGoals and the strengthening of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. The integration of the \nCPRGS approach into the SEDP, together with its previous expansion to address infrastructure \npolicies, eliminates the need for two separate planning documents.  \n \nAs we are approaching the end of one planning period and defining the directions for the next \none, we have formulated many policy actions based on both existing strategies and emerging \ndirections.  All  of  these  emerging  directions,  jointly  with  the  CPRGS  and  other  planning \ndocuments of the Government, have shaped the policy actions supported by this proposed \nprogram loan. The opening speech of Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to the seventh \nsession of the National Assembly on 5 May 2005 articulated the same themes and reviewed \nsome of the same actions covered by PRSC 4. Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung is also \nthe Chairman of the Steering Committee for the PRSC process. His speech to the National \nAssembly confirms that the proposed program loan is fully aligned with Viet Nam\u2019s reform \nagenda. \n \nWith respect to the first reform area of our development strategy, we have made a great effort to \nsteer the transition to a market economy. In fact, the past two years have been characterized by \nintense efforts to accelerate Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the WTO and to integrate with the world \neconomy, which in turn has influenced policy actions related to international trade and legal \nframework. Over the past twelve months we have made significant progress in multilateral and \nbilateral negotiations towards WTO accession. We have also reduced substantially the number \nof activities where full state-ownership is to be retained, especially through the auctioning of \nshares. Regarding banking reform, an ambitious strategy has been prepared for the coming five \nyears  with  some  important  steps  undertaken  recently.  Actions  undertaken  to  improve \ntransparency and accountability in the financial sector include the issuance of an anti-money \nlaundering decree and a microfinance institution decree, both of which benefited from ADB \nadvisory  technical  assistance  projects.  We  have  also  continued  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  private  sector  development,  especially  through  the  issuance  of  a  new \nCompetition Law limiting the dominant market position of SOEs; and a strengthened legal \nframework that allows private participation in the electricity and telecommunication sectors. \nThese actions can be traced to Part III sections I and II, and Part IV of the CPRGS. \n \nWith respect to the second reform area, we have taken a number of important steps to ensure \nsocial inclusion and environmental sustainability through education, health, land and forest and \nenvironment policies. In line with the National Education for All Action Plan 2003-2015 and our \nEducation Development Strategy 2001-2010, we have taken steps to improve the quality of \nprimary education and to open up tertiary education to private providers. Through health policy, \nwe  issued  an  action  plan  for  tuberculosis  prevention,  accounting  for  its  interaction  with \nHIV/AIDS  and  strengthened  the  regulation  and  pricing  of  pharmaceuticals.  To  improve \nenvironmental  management,  we  have  passed  a  new  Law  on  Forest  Protection  and \nDevelopment,  improvements  in  the  implementation  of  the  revised  Land  Law  and  the \ndevelopment of guidelines to govern the transfer of land from State Forestry Enterprises to \nhouseholds and communities. Actions in these areas are related to Part V section I, Part III \nsections I and III, and Part IV section IV of the CPRGS.  \n \n ", "52  Appendix 5 \nWith respect to the third reform area, we have instituted a number of measures to build modern \ngovernance.  In  November  2004,  the  Government  described  the  progress  it  had  made  in \nimplementing the CPRGS in the second Annual Progress Report. This report explains the \nreforms we are introducing to the overall planning framework. The new direction is reflected in \nthe decision to base the SEDP on robust data and evidence and to link the proposed policies to \nboth a monitoring framework and resource needs. We have also taken a number of actions to \nstrengthen  public  financial  management  and  increase  transparency.  Increased  financial \ndisclosure for all state budget entities, and the transformation of the State Audit of Viet Nam into \nan independent specialized agency, are among those actions. As you are aware of our strong \ncommitments  and  partnership  with  ADB  in  implementing  the  Public  Administration  Reform \nMaster Program, we also continue to move forward on public administration reform under this \nproposed  program  loan  by  aligning  civil  servants\u2019  salaries  with  the  market.  These  actions \ncorrespond to Part VII Section I, and Part III sections I and II in the CPRGS. Our intention to \nintegrate  the  CPRGS  approach  into  future  five-year  and  one-year  planning  processes  is \ndescribed in the CPRGS Progress Report. \n \nTackling corruption is also part of the third reform area, which is also discussed in Part II of the \nCPRGS. The Government has maintained a strong commitment to fighting corruption. The \nResolution of the 6th Central Committee plenum in December 2003 set the framework for \ndeveloping a comprehensive anticorruption program. The building blocks of this program are \nreducing opportunities for corrupt behavior and increasing the probability that those abusing \nsuch opportunities get caught. The Prime Minister has instructed the Government Inspectorate \nto take the lead in designing anticorruption policies. This instruction came at a time when the \nfirst comprehensive diagnostic of corruption, relying on an internationally organized approach, is \nnear completion. In addition the anticorruption law has been drafted and debated openly in the \nparliament. The debates were also disseminated to the public. The draft law was envisaged to \nbe passed by the National Assembly in November 2005.  \n      \nWe have noted gratefully the increasing number of co-financiers, which has increased from four \nin the case of PRSC 1, to ten, including ADB, for the current PRSC 4. The Government \nrecognizes that the support of donors goes beyond filling the gap for external financing needs. \nDonors also participate in partnership groups with the Government, which cover all economic \npolicy  areas,  and  are  instrumental  in  providing  factual  information  and  analysis,  thus \ncontributing to the monitoring of progress in reform implementation, sharing international good \npractices. Given the intensive and complex coordination that is required to manage this very \ncomprehensive  reform  program,  SBV  created  a  Program  Coordination  Unit  (PCU)  with \ndedicated staff in January 2005. This PCU deals with the program agenda, including monitoring \nand  reporting  types  of  work  to  awareness  raising,  capacity  building  and  reform  outcome \ndissemination. The PCU has engaged in frequent interactions with the World Bank and the co-\nfinanciers of the PRSC, including ADB.  \n \nWe are vigorously committed to pursuing the PRSC process to create momentum to promote \nand sustain national growth and development. We assure you that the measures and actions \noutlined  in  this  Development  Policy  Letter  and  specified  in  the  Policy  Matrix  of  PRSC  4 \ndocument and subsequent ADB loan documents will be adopted in a timely and sustainable \nmanner.  \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 5                53 \nWe are thankful for the active and valuable support, which the ADB has been providing for its \nCPRGS and SEDP implementation and especially for ADB\u2019s commitment to support the PRSC \n4.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam:  \nThe  program  loan  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  supporting  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). As a multisector instrument covering a range of \nissues related to poverty reduction, the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) and the program loan provide an \nopportunity to advance restructuring of the economy to achieve equitable economic growth and well-being. The \nCPRGS is an important vehicle to reduce poverty and improve social service delivery and other social indicators in a \nsustainable manner. This will be achieved by implementing a broad-based reform agenda, which has its foundation on \nthree key pillars: (i) transition to a market economy, (ii) social inclusion and environmental sustainability, and (iii) \nmodern governance. The Government is developing its 5-year socioeconomic development plan (SEDP), which \nintegrates  the  principles  of  the  CPRGS:  (i)  growth,  (ii)  social  development  and  poverty  reduction,  and  (iii) \nenvironmental sustainability. The integrated agenda of the SEDP and CPRGS requires major policy reform involving \ntrade integration, and reforms for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), financial sector, infrastructure, education, health, \nland,  water,  environment,  planning  process,  public  financial  management,  financial  accountability,  public \nadministration, and anticorruption. These reforms are valuable essential contributors for achieving poverty reduction, \ngrowth, and social development in a sustainable, equitable, and cost-effective manner. The planning renovation \nprocess, initiated by the Decree 2215/TH-BKHDT and the Circular 33/ Ttg dated 24 Aug 2005, is helping improve the \npolicymaking process. The program loan, which follows the PRSC 4 framework, calls for accelerating the policy \nchanges and  reforms that increase  efficiency, transparency, and  accountability; and stimulate growth, thereby \nreducing poverty and improving social services to poor people. The CPRGS and thus the program loan are consistent \nwith the poverty reduction strategy; the country strategy and program for Viet Nam (2006\u20132008); the Poverty \nReduction Partnership Agreement (2002) with Viet Nam of the Asian Development Bank (ADB); and the attainment of \nthe Viet Nam Development Goals, the country version of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? A comprehensive poverty analysis was jointly carried out as background \nto the preparation of PRSC 4.1 Viet Nam\u2019s achievements in terms of social development and poverty reduction have \nbeen remarkable. Almost one third of the total population was lifted out of poverty in less then 10 years. Poverty \nincidence was halved during 1993\u20132002 and from 28.9% in 2002 to 24.1% in 2004.2 Economic growth underpinned \nthe rapid poverty reduction. The elasticity of poverty reduction to economic growth was higher than one. The decline in \npoverty was widespread as the increase in inequality has been modest so far. Social indicators improved markedly, \npositioning Viet Nam well to attain key MDGs, which is shown remarkably in access to education, health care for \nchildren and the poor, and gender equality. The last decade was thus characterized by undeniable progress in the \nlives of the Vietnamese population.  \n \nPoverty incidence is high in remote mountain and highland areas and in the pockets of densely populated deltas and \nriver basins. Living standards in these areas are much lower than other regions. Ethnic people account for 14% of the \npopulation but 30% of the poor. The share of poverty in these regions increased during 2002\u20132004.3  \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB, Australian\u2019s Government\u2019s Overseas Aid Program, DFID, German Agency for Technical Cooperation, JICA, \nSave the Children UK, United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. 2003.

", "  Appendix 6           55 \n \nWhile decentralization has many advantages, the trend to decentralized government could amplify disparities between \nrich and poor regions, because rich regions have higher local resources and revenues, and thus will be able to spend \nsubstantially  more  on  development  and  social  services  than  poorer  regions,  which  are  dependent  on  central \nGovernment transfers. Conscious of this phenomenon, the Government has prepared the explicit session on ethnic \nsupport in the draft SEDP 2006\u20132010, which means poverty reduction interventions have been integrated in the \noverall socioeconomic development strategy. Also the Government has preferential and special programs for the poor \nand special programs for ethnic people in these regions like the comprehensive Hunger Eradication and Poverty \nReduction Program 2001\u20132005 and other targeted programs, such as Program 135, which are in place and have \ngenerally benefited the poor. The recent overall evaluation of the two programs4 proposed that the two programs be \nextended to the second phase up to 2010 and that they should be integrated into the government development \nprograms and be further decentralized, focus on capacity building, and include the participation of people in planning, \nmonitoring, and evaluation to increase the programs\u2019 effectiveness.  \n \nTo further reduce poverty and sustain the high level of economic growth, Viet Nam needs to remove structural \nweaknesses, promote socially and environmentally inclusive development, and modernize governance and the public \nadministration system. Viet Nam needs to develop policy solutions for sustainable poverty reduction such as creating \nan environment for sustainable growth, effective implementation of the social safety net, and \u2018socialization\u2019 (i.e., have \nthe private sector and community make decisions on and financially contribute to social services) of the poverty \nreduction programs. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nThe formulation of the CPRGS and the PRSCs (and thus the program loan) has involved comprehensive consultations \nand discussions with a wide range of stakeholders. It included stakeholder consultations with beneficiaries, national \nand  local  officials,  development  agencies,  and  nongovernment  organizations.  The  international  development \ncommunity has supported this process by financing studies, participatory poverty assessments, surveys, and analysis \nunder a number of activities. The Government, during 2005, has made effort to integrate the CPRGS into its SEDP \n2006\u20132010. They have adopted the approach of developing plans by organizing wide stakeholder consultation \nincluding grassroots communities. With the commitment and proactivity of the Government, ODA partners, and \nnongovernment organizations have provided support to MPI in technical and financial matters. The results out of this \nprocess will be very useful for ODA partners to align their strategy with the Government\u2019s SEDP. The comprehensive \nVietnam Development Report 2005 involved seven major development agencies, including ADB and with the Vietnam \nAcademy of Social Science (VASS) in studies and data analysis such as on poverty and social impact assessment of \nWTO accession. Besides, ADB, the World Bank, in collaboration with the Development Strategy Institute prepared the \nreports  on  regional  perspectives  on  poverty  and  growth  for  the  central  region,  Mekong  Delta  and  northern \nmountainous regions. These reports provided an input for PRSC 4 and the program loan. The Government\u2019s report on \nthe progress of MDGs, which has comments from stakeholders, has been prepared and the annual CPRGS progress \nreports continue to be a good monitoring and evaluation document for the Consultative Group meeting. \n \n \n                                                 \n4  Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs, and United Nations Development Programme. 2004.

It continued with implementing the \nCPRGS in more than 20 provinces. Development agencies, including ADB, financed the initial implementation and the \ncapacity building for local governments to conduct studies such as participatory poverty assessments and participatory \nplanning, and strategic planning of key programs for the poor. During 2005, ODA partners and nongovernment \norganizations have committed to conduct participatory community consultation, together with a series of regional \nworkshops with local governments, workshops with ministries, and workshops with business groups and ODA \ncommunities on the SEDP. This represents good implementation of the CPRGS in the context of pillar III reforms, \nwhich aims to encourage greater participation of the poor, ethnic minorities, and other marginalized groups in \ncommune decision making. These are envisaged in the new Budget Law and the Grassroots Democracy Decree. \nTraining support, career development, and mechanisms to increase participation of these groups (large and small) in \nlocal authorities, management boards, and service delivery are being promoted by the Government working jointly \nwith development agencies, including ADB. To prepare for PRSC 4 and future PRSCs, ADB and the World Bank will \njointly organize a consultation workshop among all development partners including the Government, funding agencies, \nand civil society.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe CPRGS and PRSC 4 support actions to benefit women. The Government is committed to gender equality through \npolicies and actions that will warrant a gender sensitive implementation of the program loan. The Government has \nsigned the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; the National Committee for \nthe Advancement of Women has been established and comprises 18 members at the deputy-minister level from key \nministries and central organizations; a National Strategy for the Advancement of Women in Viet Nam by 2010 is in \nplace (This strategy includes discrete targets for 2010, which relate to equal rights for women in labor, employment, \neducation, and health care; an increase in the number of woman candidates for leadership positions at all levels and \nin all sectors; and strengthening of the machinery for the advancement of women. The 2001\u20132005 National Plan of \nAction for Advancement of Women guides the first 5 years of implementation of the National Strategy; the National \nAssembly in 2003 adopted a resolution to draft and promulgate a law on gender equality, and an 11-member drafting \ncommittee has been appointed, headed by the president of the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union. The Government asked \nADB to provide advisory technical assistance to support the preparation of this law. ADB has also supported gender \nmainstreaming in the agriculture sector. Gender mainstreaming has been implemented into the national SEDP; ADB \nsupported  the  Government  in  organizing  the  gender  mainstreaming  workshop  during  August  2005.  Gender \nmainstreaming also has been conducted in several ministries like Ministry of Education and Training, Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural Development, Ministry of Labor Invalids and Social Affairs, etc.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?

First, it will promote growth and create \nemployment through greater internal and external competition, accelerate the divestiture of SOEs and SOCBs, \nestablish a sound regulatory framework, and improve transparency and accountability in SOE operations and in the \nfinancial sector. Second, it will advance human development and economic growth through expanded budget \nappropriation and higher quality standards for education; resources to cover the health care costs of the poor; \nmechanisms to complete the transfer of land-use rights to households, more secure asset ownership in the form of a \nnew land law especially in upland and ethnic minority areas; and measures to improve environmental and water \nresource management. Third, the program loan will increase transparency and accountability of public finances, \npromote simplified administrative procedures, reduce corruption, and revamp the planning processes as part of a \nbroader effort to build modern governance. The reforms will pursue the attainment of well-specified development goals \nbased on empirical analysis and wider consultations. \n \nThe reforms will result in increased private investment and exports, which will lead to additional job creation. Further \ndecentralization of public administration leading to better service delivery to the poor and increased local beneficiary \nparticipation are other expected benefits. Through appropriate measures and proactive programs, the Government will \nneed to mitigate the potential adverse economic, social, and environmental impacts of increased trade openness, \nreduction in state enterprises, and liberalization in land transactions. \n \nStrong direct and indirect benefits are expected to reach the poor in terms of increased and more rewarding \nemployment  opportunities,  improved  service  delivery,  decentralized  planning,  and  promotion  of  beneficiary \nparticipation. Any increase in employment opportunity and efficiency gain in service delivery will directly benefit the \npoor. The Government has special programs and policies in place to ensure that women and the poor have access to \njobs, basic health services, education, and infrastructure, especially in the mountainous regions and poor urban areas, \nand have priority. Its commitment to enhancing the well-being of ethnic minorities is reflected in the country\u2019s \nconstitution and the creation in 1983 of the Committee for Ethnic Minorities with ministry status. \n \nGreater exposure to world markets could lead to higher risk/variability in prices and hence the income of wage earners \nand farmers, but its overall impact is likely to be positive for the rural sector. Analytical work is ongoing for the coffee \nsector. Further commercialization of the economy may increase inequality, unless rectifying measures are taken early. \nAn assessment of the poverty and social impact of WTO accession is being undertaken, and includes a combination \nof analyses at three levels (a computable general equilibrium model to predict changes in prices of goods and \nservices; regional models to determine changes in prices of factors of production that are not mobile, such as land and \nlabor; and estimated impact on consumption at the household level). The regions of Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai \nPhong, and Danang City are expected to benefit most from WTO accession, while the poverty reduction effect for the \nmountainous areas could be more modest.  \n \nRestructuring and divesting of SOEs will cause labor retrenchment. To offset the adverse impact of retrenchment, the \nGovernment has established a fund for retrenched SOE workers. This fund has been in place since mid-2002 and an \nevaluation rates the fund as highly effective. \n \n ", "62     Appendix 6 \nPossible  Effects on the Poor  Effects on Other  Mitigation or \nChannels    Stakeholders  Enhancement Measures \nof Effect     \nReliance on market forces and private sector involvement in providing basic services could help expand the availability \nof services and create new employment opportunities, but prices of services may increase. To minimize such impacts, \nbasic services for low-income groups are provided free of charge or at reduced costs and as part of safety nets. These \nprograms already exist but may need to be expanded depending on the scope and pace of privatization/cost recovery. \nCareful consideration must be given to interregional equity when reforming service delivery, particularly for health, \neducation, transportation, and communication infrastructure. \n \nDecentralization should make local government more accountable to the poorest and include their participation in \ndecision making on development programs and delivery of services. The current participation of the poor in the \nplanning and decision-making process is low, but ongoing efforts to increase the participatory process will have \npositive impacts. These efforts include community consultations on the 5-year SEDP (2006\u20132010) and participatory \nsmall infrastructure planning in selected projects such as CBRIP, NMPRP (World Bank). The experiences on \ncommunity participation for these projects will give substantial inputs for the design of the \u201cnew 135\u201d program. Poor \nhouseholds are usually physically remote and socially marginalized. The Government has programs to accelerate \naccess to social services and education for the poor and ethnic minorities in remote areas. The recent Viet Nam \nInequality Report 2005 (Department for International Development) provides insights for better inclusion of the poor, \nthus ensuring the access of the poor to basic social services. \n \nThe new land law is expected to benefit poor and vulnerable people. As the land market develops in the medium term, \npotential adverse social impacts may have to be addressed. Two studies on the potential implications of a land market \nhave been undertaken as part of preparation of PRSC 4. Studies on land markets were also completed as part of the \nongoing Making Markets Work Better for the Poor Project being implemented by ADB. \n \nIncomplete structural reform could jeopardize growth and stability in the longer term. A fiduciary risk is associated with \ninadequate progress on enhancing budget transparency and tackling corruption. Haphazard introduction of market \nforces in the social sectors, and the trend toward decentralization have put service delivery under strain. At the same \ntime, fast integration with the world economy may lead to increased inequality, at least temporarily, as the benefits \naccrue to specific regions and skills disproportionately. Growth in Viet Nam could become less inclusive in the years to \ncome. These issues are well understood and several programs are already well established to offset the adverse \neffects. \n \nFurther details are presented in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n ", "  Appendix 6           63 \nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n1.
