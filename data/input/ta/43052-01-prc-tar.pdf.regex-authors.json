INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the country programming mission in December 2009, the government of the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ncapacity development technical assistance (TA) to help the Tianjin municipal government (TMG) \npromote  energy  conservation  in  Tianjin.  The  TA  was  included  in  ADB's  2010  non-lending \npipeline for the PRC.1 The concept paper was approved on 10 June 2010 and the fact-finding \nmission was fielded from 10\u201313 August 2010, during which an agreement was reached with the \nGovernment of the PRC on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \nand financing plan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Tianjin is located 137 kilometers southeast of Beijing. It is one of four municipalities in \nthe PRC that have provincial status, reporting directly to the central government. 2 Like many \nprovinces and municipalities in the PRC, Tianjin has experienced rapid economic growth over \nthe  past  two  decades.  In  2009,  its  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  by  16.5%  to \nCNY750 billion ($112 billion) compared with 2008\u2014the second-fastest growth among all PRC \nprovinces.3 Its GDP per capita reached CNY62,403 ($9,328), the third highest of the provinces.4 \nThe robust growth despite the global financial crisis was mainly attributable to the municipality's \nhuge investment on fixed assets, which in 2009 reached CNY500.6 billion ($74.8 billion), a \n47.1% surge over the previous year and a record high in the past 18 years.  \n \n3.  Tianjin's economic growth is largely propelled by the Binhai district, officially known as \nBinhai New Area, which is a major economic development zone within the jurisdiction of Tianjin \nmunicipality.  Binhai  New  Area  is  considered  the  strongest  and  most  dynamic  economic \ndevelopment in the Bohai Rim region5 of Northern China, and is expected to emulate the \nsuccess in the special economic development zones of Shenzhen in Guangdong and Pudong in \nShanghai. In 2009, Binhai New Area's GDP reached CNY381 billion ($57 billion) and accounted \nfor about 50% of Tianjin's GDP.  \n \n4.  Tianjin's economic development has been energy intensive. Total energy consumption in \n2008 was 53.6 million tons of coal equivalent (tce)\u2014up 8.5% from 49.4 million tce in 2007. But \nenergy intensity has dropped gradually as Tianjin adjusted its industry structure and phased out \nold production facilities.6 In 2008, Tianjin's energy intensity was 0.95 tce per CNY10,000 GDP, \ndown  6.8%  from  1.02  tce  in  2007.  This  is  about  13.8%  lower  than  the  national  average \n(1.102 tce in 2008). Tianjin ranked 8th among 30 provinces and municipalities.7 Sulfur dioxide \n(SO ) emission was also reduced, from 244,700 tons in 2007 to 240,100 tons in 2008, and \n2\nchemical oxygen demand (COD) fell from 137,300 tons to 133,100 tons. In 2009, energy \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 August 2010.  \n2  The other municipalities are Beijing, Chongqing, and Shanghai. \n3  Source: Tianjin Municipal Statistics Bureau. 2010. \n4  Report on the Work of Tianjin Municipal Government, Mayor Huang Xingguo, 26 January 2010. \n5  The Bohai Rim region centers on the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, and includes the provinces of Hebei, \nLiaoning, Shandong, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Jilin and Heilongjiang. An alliance with these cities and \nprovinces will be established within the proposed energy conservation platform. \n6  Beginning in 2006, Tianjin implemented mandatory energy-saving standards, and environmental protection policies \nand regulations for all new industrial projects. From 2006\u20132010, outdated facilities in small factories of the steel, \ncement, papermaking, glass, and chemical industries were shut down, accounting for 4.5 million tons of iron, \n1.95 million tons of cement, 7,500 tons of glass, and 18,000 tons of chemicals.  \n7  State Statistics Bureau. 2009. Report of Energy Consumption per CNY10,000 GDP of all Provinces in 2008. \n ", "2   \nintensity was down 6% from 2008, while SO and COD dropped 1% each. Expected energy \n2 \nintensity reduction in 2010 is 4%. \n \n5.  Major industries operating in Tianjin are petrochemicals, machinery, car manufacturing, \nelectronics,  mechanical  industries,  and  textile.  Tianjin's  rapid  industrial  development  and \nurbanization, if left unmanaged, could result in energy supply problems, severe air and water \npollution, and environmental degradation that could badly affect its 11.8 million population. TMG \nrecognizes that the municipality's present growth trajectory for energy and related emissions is \nunsustainable and has initiated plans toward energy conservation. Tianjin\u2019s target is aligned \nwith the national target, which is to achieve energy intensity reduction of 20% per unit of GDP \nby 2010, and emission intensity reduction of 40-45% per unit of GDP by 2020, taking 2005 as \nthe baseline. Considering Tianjin\u2019s heavy-industry-based economic structure, these are huge \nchallenges for TMG. \n \n6.  To overcome these challenges, TMG has developed an overall action plan that includes \nconserving energy, optimizing the industry structure, phasing out old production lines, and \ndiversifying the energy mix. TMG is aware of the enormous potential for energy conservation8 \nand the benefits it can provide not only by bolstering energy supply security but in reducing \nenergy resource use, associated financing needs, and emissions. TMG has set forth its energy \nconservation  plan  focused  on  six  energy-intensive  industries  (metallurgy,  petrochemical, \nconstruction, transportation, power generation, and machinery). TMG recognizes that meeting \nenergy  intensity  and  emission  reduction  targets  needs  more  concerted  efforts.  A  vigorous \nenergy conservation drive will be its next strategy for achieving its goal of sustainable economic \nand social development. \n \n7.  TMG's goal is to achieve a sustainable mechanism for promoting energy conservation \ntechnologies and providing suitable financing. However, there is an urgent need to rationalize \nthe  various  energy  conservation  technologies  available  and  customize  them  for  energy-\nintensive industrial sectors. TMG needs support in the following areas: (i) acquiring knowledge \non  international  and  national  best-practice  technologies  for  energy  conservation  in  these \nindustries  and  their  processes;  (ii)  performing  energy  audits  and  establishing  an  energy \nconservation platform (ECP) that will develop a database integrating both supply and demand \ndata, and provide guidance on the technologies best suited to these industries; (iii) identifying \nand designing suitable financing instruments for required investments; (iv) promoting energy \nconservation awareness among industrial enterprises; and (v) developing capacity. TMG is \nseeking  ADB  assistance  to  analyze  these  issues,  and  develop  a  systematic  energy \nconservation mechanism and comprehensive ECP that can serve the growing needs of the \nmunicipality and its neighboring areas in the Bohai Rim region. The TA can provide a potent tool \nfor TMG and the industry participants to determine and realize the large potential for energy \nconservation  by  selecting  the  most  suitable  technologies,  matching  them  with  innovative \nfinancing tools and financing sources, and monitoring and verifying them through a best-practice \nregulatory regime.9 \n \n                                                 \n8  TMG has established its energy conservation service capability through the Tianjin Science and Technology \nCommission. In 2008, it created four service teams for the chemical and metallurgy industries, industry boilers, and \ndistrict heating. In 2009, it added service teams for light emitting diode lighting, gas-fueled vehicles, water resource \nprotection, and building energy efficiency. \n9  An  Energy  Conservation  Ordinance,  issued  in  2001,  requires  enterprises  and  businesses  to  adopt  energy \nconservation measures and meet national energy consumption targets. TMG has since issued several supporting \nordinances. \n ", "  3\n8.  ADB's Long-Term Strategic Framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)10 made achieving \nenvironmental sustainability a priority, with energy as a core operational sector. New initiatives \n(e.g. Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility) have been introduced to augment ADB \nassistance  to  developing  member  countries  for  acquiring  low-carbon  technologies  and \nimplementing energy efficiency projects. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC11 also \nemphasized balanced and sustainable growth with more efficient use of resources and more \nstringent protection of the environment. One of the key priorities of the 11th Five-Year Plan of \nthe PRC is to improve energy efficiency by 20%, making it a flagship program to address \nclimate change and environmental challenges arising from rapid economic growth. The TA has \na close fit with both ADB's and the PRC's priorities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n   \n9.  The impact of the TA will be greater energy conservation and emission reduction in \nTianjin municipality. The outcome of the TA will be stronger capacity to plan and implement \nenergy conservation and emission reduction projects in Tianjin. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The outputs of the TA will be (i) review and analysis of international and national proven \nenergy conservation technologies, and their possible applications in selected energy-intensive \nindustries; (ii) development of a strategy and action plan to implement energy conservation \nthrough the ECP; (iii) establishment of an ECP and its implementation; (iv) priority selection of \nenergy conservation projects; and (v) capacity development and information dissemination. \n \n11.  The TA components are described below:  \n \n(i)  Review and analysis. This will (a) investigate nationally proven technologies \nand practices, and prepare comparative analysis with international best practice; \n(b) develop an inventory of establishments and the technologies that can be \napplied in six selected industries in Tianjin or the Bohai Rim region; (c) compare \nand identify the potential for energy conservation through technology upgrades; \n(d) examine the incentive or regulatory structure in place to promote energy \nconservation in these industries, compare them with international best practices \nand define the gaps, if any; and (e) analyze the financing needs and develop an \ninvestment  plan  for  energy  conservation  in  the  selected  industries.  For  the \nindustries located in Tianjin, consultants will use the information and data to be \nprovided by the executing agency and supplement them with findings from a \nsurvey conducted as part of the TA. The survey will cover about 100 companies \nin the six selected industries and obtain specific data on the technologies now \nemployed for various processes, the related energy consumption and emission \ndata, energy conservation practices, etc.   \n \n(ii)  Strategy  and  action  plan.  Based  on  the  above  data  and  its  analysis,  this \ncomponent will develop a strategy and recommend an action plan to promote \nenergy conservation through the ECP. It will determine how the activities that \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2008.

It will also (a) recommend policy considerations and an \ninstitutional  setup;  (b)  advise  on  a  regulatory  framework  that  enables \nimplementation  of  the  proposed  action  plan,  and  (c)  specify  the  responsible \nimplementation agencies and industry participants at various levels. \n \n(iii)  Establishment  of  an  ECP. This will be the main output of the TA and will \nintegrate the analysis and recommendations described in components (i) and (ii). \nThe consultants\u2019 work will include (a) developing the website and establishing \nlinks with international networks, and selected cities and provinces within the \nBohai  Rim  region;  (b)  setting  up  the  database  to  integrate  the  output  of \ncomponent (i) and data obtained through the survey, including energy saving \ninformation,  technologies,  experts,  available  resources,  opportunities; \n(c) identifying sources of funding for possible energy conservation projects; and \n(d) developing a user manual for the operation of the ECP. The consultants will \npurchase the necessary software or engage information technology services to \nhelp perform these tasks. \n  \n(iv)  Priority  selection  of  energy  conservation  projects. This will consider the \nreplication  potential  of  the  type  of  energy  conservation  measures  that  are \nselected upfront for demonstrating the ECP. It will also (a) provide a set of criteria \nfor  selecting  priority  projects,  including  technical  considerations,  investment \nrequirements, financing arrangement, and implementation schedules; and (b) \ndefine  critical  issues  to  be  addressed,  steps  to  be  taken  by  the  TMG,  and \nassistance required to develop the proposed projects. \n \n(v)  Capacity development and information dissemination.  This component will \n(a) train the executing and implementing agencies on the operation, maintenance \nand upgrade of the ECP; (b) develop a public dissemination strategy to promote \nthe use of the ECP by various industries and share the TA outputs with other \nmunicipalities  and  provinces;  and  (c)  conduct  a  consultation  workshop  with \nstakeholders,  an  international  field  study  program  for  selected  staff  of  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, and the final workshop to disseminate the \nTA outputs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). It is proposed \nthat ADB provide $400,000 equivalent on a grant basis from TASF-others. The Government will \nfinance the remaining $200,000 equivalent through in-kind contributions, including providing \ndata and other information needed for the TA, counterpart staff, office accommodations and \nfacilities, and transportation for site visits as required. The cost estimates and financing plan is \nin Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Tianjin Science and Technology Commission (TSTC) will be the executing agency \nand  responsible  for  overall  TA  management  and  supervision.  Tianjin  Intertech  Consulting \nCompany,  a  non-profit  energy  consulting  organization  co-owned  by  TSTC,  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. It will select the consultants, oversee the day-to-day implementation of \n ", "  5\nthe TA activities, and provide logistic support to the consultants. TSTC will own and manage the \nfuture  operations  of  the  ECP.  This  TA  will  be  carried  out  as  a  delegated  TA  under  the \nagreement of ADB and the Ministry of Finance.12 Consultants will be hired based on procedures \nrequired  by  ADB  and  in  close  cooperation  with  ADB\u2019s  Central  Operations  Services  Office \n(COSO). For this purpose, a capacity assessment was undertaken jointly with COSO during the \nfact-finding mission and a separate report was prepared. ADB will be responsible for signing the \ncontract with the consultants, while the executing agency will be responsible for supervising the \nconsultants\u2019 work. The executing agency will provide counterpart staff, office accommodation \nand facilities, and transportation for site visits, as required. Likewise, TSTC will make available \ndata and other information needed for the TA as well as guidance on the design of the system \ninfrastructure for the proposed ECP. \n \n14.  The TA will require a total of 5.0 person-months of international and 14 person-months \nof national consulting services. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. As a delegated \nTA, the experts will be selected by the executing agency through a consulting firm using biodata \ntechnical proposal procedures based on the quality- and cost-based selection method (quality\u2013\ncost ratio of 80:20) and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April \n2010, as amended from time to time). Survey and system development services will be part of \nthe consultants\u2019 contracts. Procurement of equipment, supplies, and materials by consultants \nunder the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Equipment purchased under the TA will be turned over to the executing agency after \ncompletion of the TA. The executing agency, with inputs from the consultants, will finalize scope \nand content of the training and information dissemination programs. Financial arrangements for \ntraining,  workshops,  survey  and  system  development  services  will  be  included  in  the \nconsultants\u2019 contracts. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (May 2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months beginning in March 2011, with an expected \ncompletion date of June 2012. The consultants will submit\u2014an inception report within 1 month; \nsurvey reports within 5 and 8 months; interim reports within 6 and 9 months; an information \ntechnology report within 12 months; a draft final report within 13 months; and the final report \nwithin 15 months of the TA start date. Information on the progress of implementation and on TA \noutputs will be disseminated through regular communications with the executing agency and \nscheduled  workshops.  Knowledge  dissemination  through  workshops  with  participation  from \nselected industries, energy service companies and government officials will be organized. At the \nend of the TA, an ECP will have been developed and made operational, and the related output \nreports and TA activities will be completed. The outcome of the TA will be subject to evaluation \nby both ADB and the government in accordance with their respective evaluation policies and \nrequirements. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.
