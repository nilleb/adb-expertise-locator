INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2014  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare a green transformation guide for resource-based \nregions of Shanxi Province. 1 The TA was included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n2015\u20132017.2 In  August  2015,  an  ADB  mission  visited  Shanxi  Province  and  reached  an \nunderstanding with Shanxi Provincial Environmental Protection Department (SPEPD) and other \nstakeholders on the TA project\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing  arrangements,  and  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As the PRC has industrialized, some resource-oriented regions have emerged as fast-\ngrowing economies. However, though industrialization can promote rapid economic growth in \nthe short term, it brings problems such as overreliance on their resources and associated heavy \nindustrial structure. Narrow-based and resource-intensive economic growth has also caused \nproblems such as tight restrictions on resources, serious pollution, and a degraded ecological \nsystem. With the resource depletion, these regions are facing serious challenges to sustainable \nand inclusive development.   \n \n3.  Shanxi  Province  is  typical  of  such  a  resource-oriented  economy.  The  province\u2019s \neconomic development relies heavily on overexploitation of coal resources and preliminary \nprocessing. It is rich in coal and mineral resources, with 62,000 square kilometers of coal-\nbearing area accounting for 40% of its total land area. It has about 265.2 billion tons of identified \ncoal resource reserves, representing 26% of coal resources nationwide. Of its 119 counties and \ncities, 94 have coal resources. Shanxi Province has made a great contribution to national \neconomic  construction  and  reform  through  its  coal  resources.  As  the  pillar  industry,  coal \nproduction in Shanxi Province amounted to 960 million tons in 2013, with about 620 million tons \nsold to other parts of the PRC. The coal industry contributes to about 30% of the province\u2019s \ngross domestic product (GDP). More than 1 million people work in the coal mining industry in \nShanxi  Province. 3  As  one  of  the  strategic  national  energy  bases,  Shanxi  Province\u2019s \ndevelopment is heavily influenced by the overall energy policy and sector development strategy \nof the PRC. \n \n4.  However,  overreliance  on  a  resource-based  economy  has  led  to  problems  in  the \nprovince such as an undeveloped economy and an industrial structure narrowly based on the \ncoal industry. This region may suffer from the \u201cresource curse,\u201d where abundant resources do \nnot bring rapid and comprehensive development but generate a series of severe constraints. \nCoal mining in Shanxi Province has caused serious damage and deterioration to the ecological \nenvironment,  excessive  use  of  resources,  and  a  decline  in  the  sustainable  development \ncapacity.  \n  \n5.  The pollution from industries such as coal, coking, and thermal power\u2014and the long-\nterm extensive growth mode\u2014have made Shanxi Province one of the provinces with the most \nserious environmental pollution and ecological destruction. According to various reports, the \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 August 2015.  \n2  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2015\u20132017. Manila. \n3  Government of the PRC, Shanxi Provincial Statistic Bureau. 2014. Yearly Statistics Report. Taiyuan. \n ", "2   \nunderground  goaf  caused  by  coal  mining  reaches  5,000  square  kilometers,  of  which \n3,000 square kilometers are mining subsistence areas.4 The cumulative coal gangue and/or \nwaste have reached more than 1 billion tons and have formed more than 1,500 coal gangue \nmountains.5 Overdependence on the mining industry has caused serious pollution. In 2013, \nShanxi Province\u2019s total emissions of smoke and powder dust amounted to 1.02 million tons and \nranked second among the provinces in the PRC; sulfur dioxide, at 1.25 million tons, ranked \nfourth; and nitrogen oxide, at 1.16 million tons, ranked seventh. The emissions per unit area of \nsulfur dioxide were 3.77 times the national average and nitrogen oxide 3.19 times the national \naverage. The air quality in 11 cities did not meet the Class II air quality requirements of the \nnational environmental standard.6 About 32% of the monitored river sections suffered serious \npollution, particularly the sections near cities and industry concentrated areas. It is estimated \nthat among the resource-based small mining cities by 2020, one-third of state-owned coal mines \nand  half  of  town-owned  coal  mines  will  have  been  shut  down  as  a  result  of  resource \nexhaustion.7   \n \n6.  Overall, the traditional economic growth pattern is a great challenge for Shanxi Province. \nShanxi Province\u2019s economic growth was stagnant in recent years, and the GDP growth rates \nwere declining since 2010. In 2014, its GDP growth stood at 4.9%, the lowest among the \nprovinces in the PRC.8 How to turn \u201cBlack GDP\u201d to \u201cGreen GDP\u201d becomes a key issue. Shanxi \nProvince has been selected to pilot comprehensive reforms for economic transformation of \nresource-intensive economies. Green transformation and moving out from the \u201cresource curse\u201d \nis necessary for the province\u2019s sustainable development for healthy economic development and \nbetter  ecological  environment.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  and  the  Shanxi  Provincial \nGovernment  are  promoting  green  transformation  in  Shanxi  Province;  and  international \nexperience is needed in the transformation process, particularly for assistance in developing a \nguide,  including  methodologies  and  indicators  for  green  transformation  planning;  and  its \napplication in selected cities and counties in Shanxi Province.  \n \n7.  The  studies  in  the  selected  pilot  cities  and  counties  will  serve  as  models  for \ndemonstration to other regions in Shanxi Province and other resource-based provinces in the \nPRC.  As  a  representative  case  of  a  resource-based  region,  Shanxi  Province\u2019s  green \ntransformation will provide both experiences and lessons to other regions that are attempting to \nbreak the resource-advantage dilemma, and to realize green and circular development toward \nachieving the national government\u2019s goal of ecological civilization. \n \n8.  The national government has introduced ecological civilization as a new concept for \ngreen, circular, and low-carbon development. Ecological civilization denotes a departure from \nthe past emphasis on economic growth as the core of development to an approach that focuses \non the quality and efficiency of development, and which is more balanced between humans and \nnature. Ecological civilization was incorporated into the overall plan for promoting economic, \npolitical, cultural, social, and ecological progress in 2012 at the Eighteenth Party Congress. The \nCongress stated that \u201cpromoting ecological progress is a long-term task of vital importance to \nthe people\u2019s well-being and [the People\u2019s Republic of] China\u2019s future.\u201d9 The Decision of the \n                                                \n4  Goaf refers to the part of a mine from which the mineral has been partially or wholly removed; the waste left in old \nworkings. \n5  Gangue refers to the worthless rock or vein matter in which valuable metals or minerals occur. \n6  Government of the PRC. 2012.

Environmentally sustainable growth is a strategic priority of ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC, and it is expected that the next country partnership strategy \nwill continue to support the national government\u2019s goal of environmental protection and green \ntransformation.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be  achievement of (i) green and circular economic development in \nShanxi Province, and (ii) transformation from a narrow-based industrial structure to a balanced \nand diversified one in Shanxi Province. The outcome will be improved strategic planning for the \nregionally balanced green transformation of resource-based regions in Shanxi Province.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA aims to achieve the outcome through the following outputs and associated \nactivities.  \n \n12.

Output 4: Formulation of two green transformation pilot studies for Liulin County \nand Xiaoyi City. This output will include (i) conduct of detailed studies on social and economic \nconditions,  natural  resources  development,  environmental  carrying  capacity,  and  industrial \nstructure in Liulin County and Xiaoyi City of Shanxi Province; (ii) an assessment or evaluation of \nthe environmental carrying capacity and industrial structure improvement each for Liulin County \nand Xiaoyi City; (iii) preparation of a policy note for regionally balanced green transformation of \nresource-based Liulin County and Xiaoyi City; and (iv) development of regionally balanced \ngreen transformation zoning and a pilot plan each for resource-based Liulin County and Xiaoyi \nCity by applying the indicators and guide developed under output 3. \n \n16.  The TA will take into account the relevant findings of previous ADB-funded studies and \nrelevant work from other donors. It will attach importance to case studies to learn best practices \nworldwide. The TA will assume that (i) relevant officials from Shanxi Provincial Government will \nactively  participate  in  the  discussions  on  the  development  of  the  technical  guidelines  and \nindicators, (ii) inter-sector cooperation and data sharing among key sectors are adequate, and \n(iii) Liulin County and Xiaoyi City governments fully support the pilot studies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, necessary data, office space, local \ntransportation to the project sites, pilot testing, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented from 15 January 2016 to 30 June 2017. SPEPD will be the \nexecuting  agency.  A  TA  management  office  will  be  established  in  SPEPD  and  will  be \nresponsible for day-to-day operations with ADB, consultants, and related government agencies.  \n \n19.  An expert panel will be set up to obtain experts\u2019 opinions, as required, on the work of the \nTA consultants and counterpart team. The panel will consist of national experts from various \nagencies. The panel will collaborate with the counterpart team to organize at least two panel \nmeetings during the TA implementation. \n \n20.  It is estimated that the TA will require 7 person-months of international and 30 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. Four international (environmental planning specialist and \ndeputy team leader, environmental economist, industrial planning specialist, energy and climate \nchange specialist) and nine national specialists (environmental planning specialist and team \nleader, environmental policy specialist, climate change specialist, air quality specialist, water \nenvironment specialist, water resources specialist, macroeconomist, industry planning specialist, \nand land use planning specialist) will be required for the TA. The specialists will be engaged \nthrough a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection method and simplified \n ", "  5 \ntechnical  proposal,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  weighting  ratio  of  90:10  given  the  high  technical \ncomplexity. Equipment will be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended from time to time) and will be handed over to SPEPD upon completion of the TA. \nOperational expenses for translation, printing, and organizing TA-related workshops will be \nincluded in the consultant\u2019s contract. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The draft \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n21.  The ADB inception, interim, and final review missions will be conducted; and tripartite \nmeetings will be held during the missions to review the consultants\u2019 performance, and TA \nimplementation progress and deliverables, based on the design and monitoring framework and \nthe consultants\u2019 work plan. The missions will also monitor the national and local governments\u2019 \ninputs and contributions, as documented in the TA report. The performance of the TA, including \nits outputs and outcomes, will be evaluated during the final review mission based on the design \nand monitoring framework. Good practices and lessons will be disseminated through workshops, \nconferences, and publications.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Study on Green Transformation \nGuide for Resource-Based Regions of Shanxi Province, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with: \n(i) Green and circular economic development in Shanxi Province achieved;a and \n(ii) Transformation from narrow-based industrial structure to a balanced and diversified one in Shanxi \nProvince achieved.a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks  \nOutcome  By 2017,     \nStrategic planning for  The technical guidelines  Shanxi Provincial  Shanxi Provincial \nthe regionally  issued by Shanxi Provincial  Environmental  Government not \nbalanced green  Government as a  Protection Department\u2019s  actively participating \ntransformation of  government circular for  annual environmental  in the discussions on \nresource-based  implementation in Shanxi  protection report   the development of \nregions in Shanxi  Province (2015 baseline: 0)  the technical \n \nProvince improved  guidelines and \nindicators  \nOutputs  By 2017,     \n1.
