THE ONGOING PROGRAM \n1.  The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Customs Reform and Modernization \nfor  Trade  Facilitation  Program  will  contribute  to  Nepal\u2019s  national  goals  in  promoting  and \ndiversifying  exports,  and  help  the  country  fulfill  its  commitments  to  the  Trade  Facilitation \nAgreement (TFA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and related international standards on \ncustoms.1 The program\u2019s impact will be expanded exports and increased export competitiveness \nof Nepal. The outcome will be increased access by legitimate trade to simplified, harmonized, and \nmodernized trade processes. The four outputs of the program will be: (i) national policy and legal \nframework  for  trade  facilitation  improved;  (ii)  customs  procedures  improved;  (iii)  Nepal\u2019s \nDepartment of Customs\u2019 (DOC) organizational structure strengthened; and (iv) DOC\u2019s capacity \nenhanced. The Government of Nepal has requested a concessional loan in various currencies \nequivalent to SDR15,341,000 ($21 million)  from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance \nthe program.2 The funds will be released in two tranches\u2014$10 million on loan effectiveness, \nexpected in August 2017, and $11 million about 24 months later\u2014once the government has \ncomplied with the policy conditions.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n2.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) is needed to help strengthen DOC\u2019s capacity to \nexecute reform measures captured in the policy matrix of the ongoing policy-based loan, which \nare in turn the strategic priorities of the 4-year national strategy\u2014the Customs Reform and \nModernization Strategies and Action Plan (CRMSAP) 2017\u20132021\u2014with which the program is fully \naligned. The program\u2019s policy measures include sector reforms to (i) improve the national policy \nand legal framework for trade facilitation, bringing it in line with international standards; (ii) improve \ncustoms procedures to reduce the cost of trade; (iii) strengthen institutions to enable effective and \nsustainable trade facilitation; and (iv) institutionalize capacity development plans to enhance \noperational capacities in a sustainable manner. \n \n3.  Although the overall risk rating for program implementation is assessed as moderate, a \nnumber of identified key risks and issues have pointed the need for TA support, including: (i) weak \ncoordination within DOC and between DOC and other trade facilitation stakeholders; (ii) frequent \nDOC staff turnover; (iii) inadequate DOC human resources, in terms of low staff numbers and \nlimited  technical  expertise  of  the  serving  staff;  and  (iv)  limited  experience  in  project \nimplementation and monitoring. Delivery of well-targeted training and provision of technical \nexpertise, underpinned by long-term policy dialogue\u2014the main ingredients of the TA\u2014cannot be \nsubsumed in the policy-based loan\u2019s budget support. The TA and the policy-based loan were thus \nincluded  in  the  Country  Operations  Business  Plan:  Nepal,  2017\u20132019  and  the  Regional \nCooperation Operation Business Plan: South Asia, 2016\u20132018.3 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

The TA first \nappeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 July 2017. \n ", "2 \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n4.  The TA outputs will help achieve the ongoing program\u2019s policy actions, and the four \noutputs  of  the  ongoing  program.  Capacity  development  support  will  be  provided  to  DOC, \ncomplementing ADB TA provided under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \n(SASEC) program.4 \n \n5.  Output 1: Legal and regulatory frameworks aligned with international standards. \nThe TA will support drafting of necessary legal and regulatory amendments to ensure compliance \nwith the revised Kyoto Convention (RKC) General Annex and the WTO TFA provisions; and \ncompile relevant manuals, standard operating procedures, and other tools for implementing the \nnew regulations in six specific priority areas: (i) risk management; (ii) post-clearance audit; (iii) \nadvance ruling; (iv) trade facilitation measures for authorized operators; (v) pre-arrival processing; \nand (vi) expedited shipments. The TA will also support the conduct of legal gap analysis and \ndrafting of legal amendments on 19 additional TFA provisions and customs procedures with \neconomic impact. To help introduce the legislative amendments to the field customs operations, \nhandbooks,  manuals,  standard  operating  procedures,  and  other  relevant tools  will  also  be \ndeveloped. Publications, particularly manuals and tools, will be printed for dissemination to \ncustoms field offices and other stakeholders present at the border areas, where access to \nelectronic information continues to be limited. This output will also require intensive workshops, \nstakeholder consultations, and training on implementing the updated rules and guidelines, for \nbetter understanding of the legal amendments among the trade and the government authorities.   \n \n6.  Output  2:  Enhanced  automated  systems  and  streamlined  customs  processes \noperationalized. To further improve compliance levels of the six identified trade facilitation \nmeasures,  the  TA  will  support  continuing  efforts  to  advance  and  expand  the  roll-out  and \nimplementation of the Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) World system. In \nparticular, a road map will be designed to launch ASYCUDA World functionalities and module \nconfiguration,  including  associated  subsystems;  a  business  re-engineering  process  will  be \nconducted for the declaration processing path; trainings will be conducted for selected customs \nofficials on new procedures and ASYCUDA World modules; gap analyses will be undertaken on \ninfrastructure and information technology requirements for e-Customs in Nepal\u2019s 18 main customs \noffices; and support will be provided to finalize the ASYCUDA World operation and maintenance \ncontract with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The DOC\u2019s move to \nrisk-based approaches is key to successful compliance with the RKC and TFA provisions. The \nTA will develop and start implementing a risk management framework and associated standard \noperating procedures, accompanied by training workshops and seminars. \n  \n7.  Output 3: DOC\u2019s organizational structure strengthened. The TA will support the \nlaunch of the major organizational restructuring plan. Major organizational change will be required \nto optimize the benefits of introducing risk-based customs procedure and automation. The TA \nwill assist in formulating new organizational structure for DOC supported by organizational \nchange management to ensure sustainable benefits.  \n \n8.  Output 4: DOC\u2019s capacity enhanced. Various TA activities will strengthen the capacity \nof DOC to ensure the timely and effective implementation of the CRMSAP 2017\u20132021\u2014DOC\u2019s \nroadmap to achieve risk-based and paperless e-Customs, and introduce customs procedures to \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2016.

Based on the capacity gap analysis conducted under the program\u2019s tranche 1, \nthe TA will help formulate a long-term DOC capacity development plan, including standard \noperating procedures and training manuals for the key strategic priorities of CRMSAP. Following \nthe results of tranche 1\u2019s mapping of existing experts in CRMSAP priority areas, the TA will assist \nDOC launch the \u201cpool of experts\u201d scheme, starting in areas where sufficient expertise was \nidentified.5 This scheme aims to fill DOC\u2019s technical capacity gaps and address staff rotation \nconstraints.  This  will  involve  a  roster  of  customs  experts  to  act  as  trainers  or  undertake \nspecialized assignments with DOC. The DOC officials, retirees, and other ex-DOC officials will \ncomprise  the  pool  of  experts  on  customs  technical  areas.  It  will  also  provide  CRMSAP \nimplementation monitoring support, including the CRMSAP mid-term review and time release \nstudies. Other knowledge support under the TA includes: a tariff review, integrity plan, hardware \nreplacement plan, standard operating procedures for coordinated border management, and a \nuniform layout for customs offices. As part of the CRMSAP 2017\u20132021 objective to improve \navailability of trade information to the public, the TA outputs will, whenever possible, be published \non DOC website, and outreach and consultation activities carried out. To this end, the TA will \nalso support overall enhancement of DOC website.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 1.  \n \n10.  The following are ineligible expenditures under the 2016 JFPR policy guidelines6 and are \nnot included in the financing plan (Appendix 1): (i) purchase of vehicles, (ii) salary for civil servants, \n(iii) any foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) detailed engineering, (vi) civil works \nand other related expenses, and (vii) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or Negative List) \nand Prohibited Investment Activities.7  \n \n11.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nand housing accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The TA will be implemented from August 2017 to February 2020 with DOC as the \nexecuting agency. ADB will administer the TA led by the South Asia Department\u2019s Regional \nCooperation and Operations Coordination Division and supported by the Nepal Resident Mission. \nThe Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division will recruit consultants and \nprocure goods.  \n \n13.
