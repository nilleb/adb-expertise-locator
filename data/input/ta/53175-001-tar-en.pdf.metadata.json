INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will advance cooperation in the \nmaritime sector of five countries\u2014Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka\u2014under \nthe South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Program. The TA will focus on \naddressing common issues adversely impacting on the performance of the subregion\u2019s ports. It \nwill conduct analytical studies to identify infrastructure projects designed to enhance maritime \nconnectivity in South and Southeast Asia, and ensure effective knowledge sharing and capacity \ndevelopment of relevant agencies on how best to address these issues. The TA is designed to \ninclude activities that encourage dialogue among stakeholders in the maritime sector in the SASEC \ncountries.1 \n \n2.  The TA is fully aligned with the strategic priorities laid out in the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Operational Plan, 2016\u20132020 and the SASEC Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025. Under the \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  operational  plan,  strengthening  connectivity  involves \nenhancing international transport linkages as well as addressing related policy constraints.2 \nLikewise,  the  SASEC  operational  plan  underscores  multimodal  connectivity  and  expanding \ntransport  and  trade  facilitation  efforts  through  maritime  cooperation. 3  This  will  assist  in \nstandardizing operations and enhancing overall trade activity. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  SASEC member countries recognize that transport is a prime catalyst for international trade \ncompetitiveness and economic growth. The inclusion in SASEC of Maldives and Sri Lanka in 2014, \nand Myanmar in 2017, has raised the importance of maritime connectivity. However, SASEC does \nnot have a modal cooperation mechanism for maritime transport despite its importance in intra-\nSASEC trade and trade with the rest of the world. At SASEC ports, productivity gains and \nenhanced operational performance are becoming more critical, with shipping clients demanding \nimprovements. Considering current delays in container transit, the ability to expedite transit times \nbetween discharging from the vessel and delivering cargo to the end user will reduce trade and \ntransport costs and ensure the reliability of international logistics chains. \n \n4.  Trade in South Asia is expected to continue to increase significantly both in terms of \nintraregional movements and trade outside the region. Most of this import and export traffic will be \ncarried via the maritime mode. Thus, advancing cooperation in the maritime sector in the SASEC \ncountries is crucial in realizing the subregion\u2019s potential economic growth, particularly as income \ngenerated by trade can be used to address poverty reduction. \n \n5.  A core problem faced by SASEC ports is the limited maritime connectivity among member \ncountries. Contributory causes include (i) the high cost of trade and transport, (ii) delays in the \ntransit of containers and/or excessive dwell times at SASEC ports,4 (iii) redundant and manual \ndata exchanges between various parties in the port  community, (iv) prolonged cargo clearance \nprocedures, (v) limited inland transport and port infrastructure adversely impacting on hinterland \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on 10 May \n2019.  \n2  ADB.  2016.  Operational  Plan  for  Regional  Cooperation and  Integration, 2016\u20132020:  Promoting  Connectivity, \nCompetitiveness, Regional Public Goods, and Collective Action for Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2016. South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025. Manila. \n4  Dwell time refers to the amount of time a container waits to be picked up at a marine terminal after being unloaded   \nfrom a vessel or post-delivery before loading (Pacific Merchant Shipping Association. 2016. Container Dwell Time \u2013 \nMetrics for Port Efficiency and Velocity). \n ", "2 \nlogistics, (vi) legal and regulatory barriers, and (vii) limited knowledge of maritime cooperation and \ncoordination and international best practices in port operations. \n \n6.  Redundant and manual data exchange between port players. The use of information \nand communication technology within the SASEC ports is increasingly comprehensive, particularly \nat an individual container terminal level and within national customs organizations. However, the \nuse of information and communication technology is much lower in other organizations in the port \nenvironment, resulting in the duplication of data exchanges between various parties in the port \ncommunity. Leading global ports have addressed this issue by developing port community systems \n(PCSs) that link all the players in the port community\u2014eliminating the need to key in data \nseparately to each party. This enables faster clearance procedures, resulting in lower cargo dwell \ntimes in the port area. \n \n7.  Legal and regulatory issues. The legal and regulatory framework needs to be reformed \nto ensure that any residual national legal and regulatory barriers to maritime connectivity between \nSASEC member countries are eliminated or modified to reflect changes in the maritime trading \nenvironment. Identified issues include the need for coastal shipping arrangements, cabotage, \nreservations of cargo for own flagged vessels, access to national waterways, and competition \ncontrols. These areas can directly affect the nature of shipping connectivity between SASEC \ncountries. \n \n8.  Underdeveloped hinterland logistics. Underdeveloped infrastructure to support port \noperations includes a lack of \u201clast mile\u201d dedicated port access roads and a shortage of supporting \ninland container depots and container freight stations.5 The absence of such infrastructure remains \na major bottleneck to reducing terminal dwell times. Underdeveloped infrastructure is manifested \nin gate congestion, often caused by bunching of truck arrivals and complex operations at the port \ngate, and external curfews on connecting roads. The shortage of inland container depots and \ncontainer freight stations results in the need for more container clearances within the port area, \nincreasing dwell times and incurring additional cargo handling costs. \n \n9.  Limited port facilitation. Key agencies affecting terminal dwell times are cross-border \nregulatory agencies such as national customs organizations and other border protection agencies \n(e.g., sanitary and phytosanitary). However, moving containers through a port requires additional \nclearances by several nonregulatory bodies such as port authorities, stevedores, shipping lines \nand their agents, and transport companies. These procedures are also a factor in extended dwell \ntimes. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is already actively engaged in covering the cross-\nborder regulatory agencies through the SASEC trade facilitation program.6 \n \n10.  Growth  in  passenger  traffic.  The  number  of  cruise  passengers  in  Asia  has  been \nincreasing by an estimated annual average of 33%, from 775,000 in 2012 to nearly 4.26 million in \n2018.7 The desire to visit new destinations, combined with a growing middle-income population in \nSouth Asia, suggests that more passenger vessels will regularly visit SASEC ports in the future. \nThis trend can adversely impact on freight-handling operations and extend cargo dwell times \nbecause of the priority given to such vessels at ports lacking dedicated passenger berths. Handling \npassenger vessels on freight berths often has a knock-on effect on cargo dwell times. Certain \nSASEC ports will need to plan adjustments to their procedures and infrastructure in support of \ntourism promotion by their national governments. \n                                                \n5  Last mile refers to the final leg of freight movements, which are often made on local roads.

Two SASEC countries\u2014Bangladesh and Maldives\u2014are prone to rising sea levels \nas a result of climate change. The rise in sea levels can exacerbate current environmental \nproblems such as ship- and cargo-handling pollution as well as vehicle emissions. To combat such \nclimate  change  risks,  ports  are  increasingly  adopting  \u201cgreening\u201d  programs  to  balance \nenvironmental challenges with economic demands. Greening will incorporate handling climate \nchange in terms of adaptation and mitigation. This will have an impact on port management as \nwell as the development and operation of port infrastructure. Training and guidance on the latest \nenvironmental  management  system  standards,  with  best  practices  and  the  most  suitable \ntechnologies, will be necessary to enable SASEC ports to become \u201cgreen ports.\u201d \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) port infrastructure to enable the efficient \nhandling of the subregion\u2019s maritime trade developed and capacity to cope with the anticipated \ngrowth in container traffic expanded; and (ii) port logistics and facilities for the efficient handling of \ncargo in major SASEC ports improved (footnote 3). The TA also aligns with the interim outcome \nof the United Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity (ARTCF)\u2014improved \ninfrastructure design and policy processes toward greater regional connectivity and trade. The TA \nwill have the following outcome: pipeline of SASEC maritime projects and initiatives finalized.8 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  Output  1:  Analytical  studies  promoting  maritime  cooperation  in  South  Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation conducted. ADB will conduct analytical work to assess the \ncore nature  of the  issues, identifying their  present  and future  impact. The studies  will include \n(i) identification of the current status and plans for introducing PCSs in the subregion, preparation \nof business process analysis of all clearance procedures, and the formulation of PCS development \nplans, together with funding needs for the selected ports; (ii) identification of the nature and impact \nof legal and regulatory constraints to shipping services and proposals for remedial strategies to \nmitigate the adverse impact of these barriers; (iii) examination of the demand for and location of \nadditional logistics infrastructure and dedicated access roads to enhance the movement of traffic \nbetween the port and its hinterland for selected sites; (iv) assessment of the potential growth of \ncruise tourism and actions required by ports to accommodate such traffic, including the cost of \nfacilities that will be needed to support the sector at the selected ports; and (v) assessment of the \ncurrent environmental status of the key SASEC ports and identification of greening strategies to \npromote healthy oceans through efficient pollution control and sustainable port infrastructure. The \nstudies will attempt to identify future investment projects as well as the critical path leading to their \nsuccessful implementation. The research methodology for all studies will employ quantitative \nmethods grounded in relevant economic theory, supplemented by qualitative analysis. Where \nrelevant, ADB will conduct enterprise surveys and primary interactions with stakeholders. The \nknowledge products will consider gender elements, as appropriate. \n \n14.
