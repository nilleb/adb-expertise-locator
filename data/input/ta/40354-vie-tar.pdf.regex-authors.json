The Government of Viet Nam (the Government) has requested ongoing assistance from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the health sector as the Government continues to \nstrengthen and develop the country\u2019s health systems. This is consistent with ADB\u2019s support for \nViet Nam\u2019s 5-year Socioeconomic Development Plan,1 which includes social development and \nenvironmental protection as one of the three pillars forming the basis of Viet Nam\u2019s overall \ndevelopment. Development of the health system will be integral to achieving national goals in \nrelation to this pillar and to the overall plan. The proposed program is the second health sector \nactivity2 included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and project for 2007\u20132010,3  which includes a strong \nfocus on inclusive social development with the goal of reducing morbidity and improving health, \nlife expectancy, and quality of life.  \n \n2.  The ADB project preparatory technical assistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission was fielded \nfrom 6\u201320 July 2007 and reached an understanding with the Government on the scope and \nmodality of the proposed program as well as the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements and indicative terms of reference for the TA.4 \nAppendix 1 presents the design and monitoring framework. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.  Sector Performance \n \n3.  The Government remains strongly committed to providing quality health care for all \ncitizens. Through ongoing efforts to upgrade the network of services, which range from village \nhealth workers to national-level hospitals, and as a result of rapid economic growth, Viet Nam \nhas achieved significant improvements in key health indicators and is on track to achieve most \nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 related to health.5  \n \n4.  Yet  despite  investments  in  the  health  sector  and  the  improvements  in  key  health \nindicators, Viet Nam\u2019s efforts to provide equitable access to high-quality health services, to \nimprove health outcomes, and to respond to the changing demands and needs of its rapidly \nurbanizing and increasingly prosperous population face major challenges. Gains in national \nhealth indicators are driven by the heavily populated areas of the Red River (Hanoi) and \nMekong (Ho Chi Minh City) deltas, while remote and rural areas in the north, center, and south \nhave  not  enjoyed  such  gains  and  lag  significantly  in  relation  to  MDG  achievements.  For \nexample, child malnutrition levels, as indicated by the prevalence of low weight for age among \nchildren under 5, fell from 37% in 1999 to 25% in 2005 nationally; however, in poor central \nprovinces, such as Kon Tum, the prevalence of low weight for age remains high at 36%. \n \n5.  Rapid economic growth has led to increased expectations and rising demand from the \nemerging  middle-class  for  higher-quality  services,  including  modern  medical  technologies. \nOvercrowding  in  urban  hospitals  is  an  acute  problem  facing  both  the  national  and  local \ngovernments  as  consumers  express  increased  frustration  with  the  situation.  Moreover,  as \neconomic growth affects people\u2019s lifestyles, the disease profile in urban areas is changing from \none  dominated  by  infectious  disease  to  one  dominated  by  chronic  diseases,  in  particular, \n                                                 \n1  Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. 2006.

Hanoi.  \n2  The first project, Health Care for the South Central Coast, is under preparation and is scheduled for consideration \nby ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in early 2008.  \n3  ADB. 2006. Viet Nam: Country Strategy and Program 2007\u20132010. Manila.  \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 7 September 2007. \n5  Key indicators on which Viet Nam is not expected to reach MDG targets relate to HIV infection rates (MDG 6) and \naccess to safe water supplies and sanitation (MDG 7). \n ", "2 \ncardiovascular conditions and tobacco-related respiratory diseases. Accident-related morbidity \nand  mortality,  related  predominantly  to  traffic  accidents,  are  also  becoming  a  significant \ncomponent of the disease burden and placing increasing the demand for health and social \nservices. Low levels of expenditure underlie many of the remaining and persistent problems in \nthe health sector, with annual health expenditure per capita estimated to be approximately $26 \nin 2003, of which only $8 came from public sources. \n \n6.   The Government recognizes that while ongoing investment in physical infrastructure is \nneeded, the health system\u2019s ability to respond to the remaining, and to emerging, challenges will \nrequire renewed efforts to strengthen the key policies and institutional structures that underpin \nthe sustainability and quality of service delivery. Politburo Resolution Number 46 (2005) notes \nthat the health system has been stagnant in relation to reforms and urges \u201crenewing and \nimproving the health system along the lines of equity, efficiency and development to facilitate \nthe protection, care and promotion of health for all with increasingly higher quality in conformity \nwith the socio-economic development of the country.\u201d6 In response, the Ministry of Health\u2019s \n(MOH\u2019s) Master Plan (2006\u20132010)7 calls for making access to and use of health services more \nequitable and for making health services more effective. The plan also aims to improve the \nquality of health care at all levels, especially for the poor, women, children, the disabled, \nminority groups, and those living in remote and disadvantaged areas. \n \nB.  Sector Priorities \n7.  While  the  needs  for  policy  development  and  investment  are  diverse,  complex,  and \nintricately interwoven, the Government has identified three areas that require particular attention \nin the short to medium term if it is to advance its overarching goals of equity, efficiency, and \ndevelopment. These areas\u2014human resources, health financing, and health service provision\u2014\nhave already been the focus of some intensive policy analysis and donor-supported TA, but \nmore analysis and donor support are needed. Moreover, the Government\u2019s legislative and \npolicy reform agenda for the next 3\u20134 years provides important opportunities to introduce critical \nreforms and other measures that could significantly develop and strengthen the health system. \n \n8.  Human Resources. While Viet Nam has a relatively large number of health workers, the \nlevel  of  skills  and  the  distribution  of  these  workers  are  major  constraints  to  achieving \nimprovements in health services and outcomes. Medical specialists, nurses, college-trained \npharmacists, rehabilitation workers, public health workers, managers (particularly for hospitals), \nand the like are in short supply. Among the trained workforce, the systems and incentives for \nongoing  skills  development  and  maintenance  are  poor.  Distribution  issues  include  acute \nshortages in rural and remote areas, where health needs are the greatest, while public sector \nservices in urban areas are facing growing losses of highly skilled health professionals to the \nemerging private sector. Policies and institutional structures to address these constraints have \nhad limited success to date, and the Government is now giving high priority to these issues \ngiven the critical role the health workforce plays in every aspect of health system strengthening. \n \n9.  Health Financing. In addition to the low levels of public spending on health (1.5% of \ngross domestic product), social health insurance coverage remains low (approximately 30% of \nthe population). The Government has a goal of universal health insurance coverage, although \nthe original plan for achieving this by 2010 is under review. Moreover, while coverage has been \nslowly growing, in recent years, increases in premiums have quickly overtaken income growth, \n                                                 \n6  Politburo. 2005. Resolution No. 46-N QJW: On People\u2019s Health Protection, Care and Promotion in the New \nContext. Hanoi.  \n7  Government of Viet Nam. 2006. Master Plan for Health System Development in Viet Nam by 2010 and Vision to \n2020. Hanoi. \n ", "3 \nleading  to concerns about  the  financial  viability  of  the  current  system.  A  significant  policy \ndevelopment in 2005 was the adoption of the health care funds for the poor policy, which \nprovides free health services and approved drugs to approximately 14.3 million poor people.8 \n \n10.  Health Service Provision. The quality of health services and low consumer satisfaction \nwith service provision are persistent and growing problems for consumers and the Government \nalike. The systems and guidelines for internal quality control in hospitals and levels of service \nprovision are weak, and the regulatory frameworks and institutions for external quality reviews \nand inputs are not well developed. These deficits are becoming increasingly acute with the \nrapidly expanding availability of and demand for private sector services. The growing flow of \npatients seeking services at higher than necessary levels of care even for relatively minor \nailments and from the private sector even at great personal expense indicate the high level of \nconsumer dissatisfaction. \n \nC.  Development Partners and Financing Modalities \n11.  International development partners, including ADB, have provided continued support to \nthe health sector, although total official development assistance (ODA) financing for the health \nsector is low relative to overall expenditures (less than 10%). Since the mid-1990s, ADB has \napproved financing for six major health projects,9 with a seventh (see footnote 2) scheduled for \nconsideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in early 2008. For the most part, ADB and other ODA \nfinancing has been directed to provincial and district-level health service investments in civil \nworks, equipment procurement, and workforce training as well as to targeted programs, such as \nthose aimed at reproductive health, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. With more recent concerns \nabout  Viet  Nam\u2019s  vulnerability  to  newly  emerging  infectious  diseases,  exemplified  by  the \noutbreaks of SARS and avian influenza in Viet Nam, ADB and other development partners have \nalso provided financial support and TA to strengthen Viet Nam\u2019s preventive health services. \n \n12.  In recent years, the Government and international development partners have looked at \nreforming the mechanisms for providing ODA in particular sectors. The Paris Declaration (March \n2005)10 and  the  Hanoi  Core  Statement  (June  2005)11 call  for  new  funding  modalities,  in \nparticular, reduced use of project management units, with their effect on lowering efficiency for \nthe Government and partners alike. There is now some experience with the development and \nimplementation of program based financing in several sectors and increased interest in the \ndevelopment of similar mechanisms for the health sector. The Government has expressed its \nsupport for ODA to be more closely coordinated within the health sector and for strengthening \nsupport to the Government\u2019s ongoing policy and investment agenda. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  Government of Viet Nam. 2002.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The intended impact of the Program is to accelerate the attainment of improved health \noutcomes  through  strengthened  health  systems.  The  program  will  support  key  policy \ndevelopment and associated investments in one or more of the following areas: (i) human \nresources, with a focus on planning for and monitoring workforce needs, providing in-service \ntraining,  and  examining  workforce  distribution;  (ii)  health  financing, particularly  capacity  for \nadministering the health insurance system; and (iii) health service provision, with a focus on \nsystems that improve the quality and financing of services and associated monitoring and \nevaluation processes. \n \n14.  The outcome of the TA will be a feasibility study and a design for a sector development \nprogram agreed to by ADB and the Government.12 The feasibility study and program design will \ninclude a policy matrix that describes technically and economically feasible policy goals and \nmonitorable actions along with an accompanying investment component that will support policy \ndevelopment and implementation in selected key areas. Appendix 2 presents an initial poverty \nand social analysis. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The TA will (i) analyze key policy measures in the three priority areas and identify areas \nwhere further developments are planned and needed; (ii) conduct extensive consultations within \nthe Government and among other stakeholders on the priorities for policy reform and capacity \nbuilding; (iii) provide technical support to key stakeholders, particularly the MOH, in relation to \nongoing policy development work; and (iv) prepare a policy matrix, investment proposal, and \nimplementation plan for possible assistance from ADB and other international development \nagencies. \n \n16.  In the first month, the TA team will review the health sector\u2019s performance, national \npolicies and plans, and previous sector reviews and analyses. The team will also consult with \nministries and sector partners in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, selected provincial officials and \nhealth sector staff, and consumers. The findings from these reviews and consultations will be \nused to identify the main issues and key opportunities for policy support through TA and linked \ninvestments. Technical specialists will work closely with Government counterparts to support \npolicy developments already under way while coming to understand the opportunities for further \nreform and support consistent with existing processes and systems. Specialists will contribute \nindependent  analyses  of  and  contributions  to  policy  options  drawing  on  international  best \npractice and technical reviews of relevant local experience. \n \n17.  Each  specialist  subteam  will  identify  technically  sound  and  realistic  proposals  for \ninclusion in the policy matrix and will develop more detailed plans for a set of closely linked \ninvestments that will support program implementation. Initial proposals for inclusion in the policy \nmatrix and investment program will be discussed at the midterm workshop (month 3) and further \nrefined based on feedback from stakeholders and continued technical analysis. The team will \nconsult  closely  and  regularly  with  other  development  partners,  including  the  World  Health \nOrganization, the World Bank, the European Commission, and the Government of Australia to \nensure technical coordination and to develop and explore options for cofinancing and technical \ncollaboration. \n \n                                                 \n12 The three proposed areas of focus are not currently covered at the national policy level by other ODA financing in \nthe health sector and the proposed financing modality will be innovative for this sector.  \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $830,000. The amount of $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment of Australia will provide a grant of $180,000 to be administered by ADB. The \nGovernment will provide the equivalent of $150,000 through in-kind contributions for counterpart \nstaff, workshops, and facilities. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  the  TA  does  not  commit  ADB  or  the \nGovernment of Australia to finance any ensuing program.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The MOH will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will appoint a part-time TA \ndirector and a full-time TA deputy director. A steering committee chaired by a vice minister will \nbe established in the MOH to review and guide TA work. The Department of Science and \nTraining will be responsible for TA implementation. The vice minister responsible for human \nresources will  provide  overall  leadership,  and  will  arrange  monthly  meetings  to  guide  and \ncoordinate TA activities. The MOH will establish, manage, and administer an advance payment \nfacility to facilitate disbursements in accordance with procedures agreed on with ADB. \n \n20.  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Australia  financing  will  support  28  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services (person\u2013months are in parenthesis), including a team leader \nand health system planning expert (6); a human resources development expert (6); a health \nworkforce training, skills development and institutions expert (4) a health financing expert (4); a \nhealth services expert (6); and, a poverty, gender, and ethnic minority specialist (2). ADB and \nthe Government of Australia financing will also support 36 person-months of national consulting \nservices, including experts in health systems planning (6), human resources (6), workforce \ntraining (6), health insurance (6), hospital services (6), social development (4) and a financial \nmanagement (2). ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Given the highly specialized knowledge \nthat will be sought along with experience specific to Viet Nam, a firm is unlikely to be able to \ngather such specialized expertise in a single team, therefore consultants will be appointed as \nindividuals. Indicative terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. The MOH will \nprocure equipment under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). The MOH will retain the equipment on completion of the TA. \n \n21.  The project director and team leader will submit an inception report to the MOH and ADB \nwithin 1 month of TA implementation. A detailed sector analysis will be submitted at midterm, \nalong with a draft policy matrix, investment project concept, and draft program framework. The \ndraft  final  report  will  be  submitted  after  5  months  and  the  final  report  after  6  months. \nConsultation workshops will be held with the MOH and other stakeholders at inception, at \nmidterm, and at the time of preparing the draft final report. The TA will become effective around \nJanuary 2008 and will be completed by December 2008. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.
