At  the  request  of  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  technical \nassistance (TA) for employment services (ES) for migrant workers was included in the country \nstrategy and program update 2007\u20132008.1 TA fact-finding was undertaken in August 2006 and \nan agreement was reached with the Government, including the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the \nNational Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the Ministry of Labor and Social \nSecurity  (MOLSS),  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact  and  outcome,  outputs,  costs  and  financing, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Over the past two decades, an estimated 120 million workers in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina have migrated from rural to urban areas in search of improved employment and income \nopportunities.2 Rural\u2013urban migration is continuing at a high pace, and an estimated 10 million \nworkers are expected to migrate from the countryside each year during the 11th five-year \nprogram period (2006\u20132010) in search of employment in urban areas. While migrant workers \nhave made a significant contribution to economic growth in key urban areas, the massive influx \nof migrant workers, most with limited employable skills and education, or even basic urban \nsurvival skills, has raised a large number of employment-related and social issues. The majority \nof migrant workers have relied on assistance from friends and relatives and the word-of-mouth \nnetwork for migration and job seeking; and about one third left their homes without any public or \nprivate assistance. According to MOLSS estimates, only about 15% of all migrant workers have \nreceived assistance from publicly supported ES. In addition, migrant workers, as an expanding \npopulation group, have joined the ranks of the urban poor. \n \n3.   The current ES system no longer meets ES needs, which have risen markedly with the \nrate of rural\u2013urban migration. Processes, information systems, and staffing levels and capacity \nare inadequate to meet current needs and urgently need to be reviewed and strengthened. An \nimproved ES system, when effectively implemented, will deliver significant benefits. For migrant \nworkers, effective public ES will reduce the costs of migration, resulting in (i) less time and \nresources spent on moving and job seeking, (ii) improved opportunities to find better and stable \njobs; (iii) improved working conditions and rights protection; and (iv) higher earnings garnered in \nthe longer term, thus improving living standards. At the macro level, strengthened ES will \n(i) reduce overall transaction costs, (ii) improve the effectiveness of the labor markets, and \n(iii) enhance sustained economic growth. A better ES system will lead to more orderly and \neffective rural\u2013urban migration, which in turn will contribute to balanced development with less \ndisparity between rural and urban areas and between more affluent coastal and less-developed \ncentral and western regions.3 Strengthening the public ES for migrant workers is consistent with \nthe overall development strategies of the Government. Chapter 9 of the 11th five-year plan \nspecifically cites the strengthening of ES as a key element in supporting the transfer and \nemployment of the rural labor force.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. People\u2019s Republic of China: Country Strategy and Program Update (2007\u20132008). Manila. The TA first \nappeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 August 2006. \n2 This estimate includes only interprovincial migrant workers. If intraprovincial migrant workers were included, the \nnumber would be about 200 million.  \n3 According to statistics, annual remittances from migrant workers amount to $60 billion\u2013$70 billion, contributing \nsignificantly to raising the living standards of the rural population. ", "2   \n4.  Lack of Public ES Infrastructure for Migrant Workers. The publicly supported ES \nsystem  was  established  in  the  1980s  to  support  market  reforms  and  sustained  economic \ndevelopment. Until a few years ago, however, the system was focused on urban unemployment \nand  reemployment,  particularly  those  losing  their  jobs  because  of  state-owned  enterprise \nrestructuring or groups with special difficulties in finding employment (e.g., the elderly and \nothers with limited education and skills). Since 2005, high priority has been placed on improving \npolicies and services for migrant workers in support of more orderly and effective rural\u2013urban \nmigration.4 Improving ES for migrant workers is a key pillar in the Government\u2019s employment \npolicy  framework.5  However,  the  effective  implementation  of  these  policies  will  require  a \nsignificantly improved ES system capacity. First, the established national ES network, covering \nneighborhoods  and  communities,  exists  only  in  urban  areas.  Effective  mechanisms  and \nmeasures will be needed to ensure that migrant workers receive pertinent advice and guidance \nbefore or as they start to migrate. Second, several agencies deal with migrant worker\u2013related \nissues at the central and local government levels, and interagency policy coordination and \nimplementation needs to be strengthened.6  \n \n5.  Labor Market Information and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) \nConstraints.  Systematic  information  systems\u2014collecting,  analyzing,  processing,  and  using \ninformation about migrant workers and job market demand and supply, and disseminating and \ncommunicating this information effectively to users\u2014are essential to effective migrant worker \nES. A migrant-worker indicator system urgently needs to be established. This system should be \nbased on the main phases or steps of the migration process and a clear understanding of \ntypical issues and problems faced by migrant workers at each step. The information that is \ncurrently being collected is local and segmented, and is insufficient for providing effective ES to \nmigrant workers. A dynamic indicator system should include information from both source and \ndestination locations. The next step would be to design and put in place effective means and \nmechanisms for disseminating ES information to migrant workers. It is particularly important to \nprovide them with appropriate advice and guidance in the early stages of the migration process.  \n \n6.   Migrant workers have tended to work in a limited number of industries and professions, \nparticularly in services that have grown fastest and have generated the most jobs. However, the \nES system has not kept up with the growing need for timely information about job classifications \nand  descriptions,  technical  and  preparatory  requirements,  and  other  employment-related \ninformation. This detailed information about jobs rather than professions\u2014the latter group is \nmuch broader and often too general to be useful for specific job guidance\u2014will be instrumental \nin  guiding  migrant  workers  in  their  job  search.  The  development  of  job  classifications  in \nprofessions and industries with high migrant-worker concentrations is thus a task that requires \nurgent attention. \n \n7.   The  Government  has  invested  significant  resources  in  computerizing  the  public  ES \nnetwork over the years, but much remains to be done. Today, the local networks established in \nmore than 100 medium-sized and large cities are playing an important role in improving the \neffectiveness and efficiency of public ES and labor markets. Extending the reach of the local \nnetworks, connecting them to regional and eventually national networks, and increasing their \neffectiveness are among the major challenges facing the system. A systematic approach is \n                                                 \n4  As  the  wave  of  restructuring  of  state-owned  enterprise  is  subsiding,  the  employment  of  school  graduates \n(secondary, senior secondary, and tertiary) is also receiving increasing policy attention.  \n5  Recent policy documents include the State Council Directives #36 (December 2005) and #5 (January 2006).   \n6  In April 2006 an interagency coordinating group was established under the State Council as a mechanism for \ncoordination at the central government level. MOLSS is the lead agency in the group. Similar mechanisms are \nbeing established at the provincial and lower government levels.  \n ", "  3\nneeded to assess holistically not only the resources required for expanding the ICT networks, \nbut also measures and mechanisms for making the system more effective.  \n \n8.  Staff Capacity Constraints. There is an acute shortage of ES professionals, especially \nat the advanced level. At present, there are fewer than 40,000 qualified employment guidance \nprofessionals nationwide, for a ratio of one professional to 50,000 people, compared with the \nratio of 1:3,000 in advanced economies. In addition, there are severe shortcomings in the \nqualifications of staff and the quality and effectiveness of the advice and guidance provided by \nES  staff  to  migrant  workers.  The  shift  in  focus  of  the  publicly  supported  ES  from  urban \nunemployed (mainly from state enterprises) to migrant workers took place only recently, and \nmost staff lack experience and qualifications to be effective in serving migrant workers. Only 6% \nof the 40,000 qualified vocational guidance professionals have qualifications at the advanced \nlevel, and there are few qualified vocational information analysts. Of these professionals, even \nfewer have expertise and experience in working with migrant workers. While capacity building is \na long-term task, specific mechanisms and efforts to build capacity for public ES staff targeting \nmigrant workers can bring significant benefits in the short and medium term. An urgent task is to \nimprove the quality of the advice they give regarding job descriptions, job requirements, and \nrequired  preparations  in  industries  where  migrant  workers  tend  to  concentrate,  including \nprocessing and manufacturing, construction, social services, hotel and restaurant, and retailing \n(para. 6). As such capacity-building needs are systemic, it is essential to assess not only timing \nand resource needs but also effective methods of capacity building so that migrant workers can \nbenefit at both source and destination locations in a relatively short time.  \n \n9.   Public-Private Sector Partnership. While MOLSS and provincial labor bureaus are \nexpected to provide basic ES, government policies encourage private sector participation in \nproviding ES. Private firms providing fee-based employment services are particularly active in \ncoastal  urban  cities  and  areas  with  a  concentration  of  migrant  workers.  A  number  of \nprofessional associations and federations, including migrant workers\u2019 groups, also provide ES. \nThere is a need to (i) review and improve ES policies and measures, including the regulatory \nenvironment  for  private  ES  providers;  and  (ii)  assess  the  effectiveness  of  measures  and \nmechanisms through which public ES and fee-based private ES can complement each other in \nbetter serving migrant workers by reducing their search costs and time, and helping them find \nappropriate jobs.  \n \n10.  Gender Issues. Women, while accounting for less than 50% of all migrant workers, tend \nto concentrate in a narrow range of jobs and industries. For example, young women workers \nfrom other provinces dominate in numbers in many large manufacturing and processing plants \nin coastal urban areas. Issues specific to young women migrant workers must be systematically \nreviewed and ES must be tailored to their special needs.   \n \n11.  MOLSS, the Executing Agency of the TA, has effectively collaborated with other bilateral \nand international agencies on urban employment issues.7 However, the TA is the first instance \nof international cooperation of this scale undertaken by MOLSS on ES for migrant workers. The  \nTA will coordinate closely with the recent and ongoing TA provided by the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  recent  policy  focus  on  urban  poverty,  including \nmigrant workers.8  \n                                                 \n7  MOLSS has successfully cooperated with the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom \nand the International Labour Organization on general employment and urban employment issues.  \n8  ADB. 1999.

The TA will strengthen the capacity and effectiveness of public ES for rural\u2013urban \nmigrant  workers.  As  a  result  of  the  TA,  higher  authorities  in  the  central  and  provincial \ngovernments are expected to consider key measures for improving ES for migrant workers.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA outputs will be (i) key policy recommendations on measures and mechanisms \nfor improving public ES for migrant workers, and (ii) widely disseminated publications on key TA \nfindings and recommendations. The policy recommendations will be drawn from the analysis \nand assessment in the main TA report of the key issues discussed in paras. 2\u201310 above, \nincluding (i) policy environment, (ii) capacity constraints and efficiency issues, (iii) labor market \ninformation  systems,  (iv)  capacity  building  for  ES  staff,  (v) strengthening  of  public-private \npartnership,  and  (vi)  gender  issues.  These  policy  measures  and  effective  mechanisms  for \nimplementation should be identified, prioritized, and costed. Supporting technical reports will be \nprepared on (i) ICT systems and networks, and effective modes and means of information \ndissemination to migrant workers; and (ii) staff capacity-building needs in key areas including \ninformation management, coordination, and networking, to improve vocational guidance for \nmigrant workers. Policy recommendations and key TA findings will be processed and packaged \nas  knowledge  products  for  dissemination  among  the  stakeholders  and  the  general  public \nthrough  a  variety  of  media  including  websites,  printed  materials,  and  presentations  at \nconferences. \n \n14.   A  survey  will  be  conducted  and  its  results  carefully  analyzed  at  the  start  of  TA \nimplementation to gain a better understanding of the migration process, and the need for ES at \neach step of the process. This knowledge will be essential to the design of a set of migrant-\nworker indicators, on which the systematic reporting, processing, and use of migrant-worker \ninformation for public ES will be based. A better information system, in turn, is needed to \nstrengthen the capacity of ES staff and the effectiveness of the services provided to migrant \nworkers by the public ES system. The survey will also provide information about poverty among \nmigrant workers and how ES can help improve the situation through better jobs and higher \nincome. \n \n15.   Three workshops and one conference will be held. The workshops will serve as a venue \nand platform for (i) sharing TA findings at various stages, (ii) building consensus among TA \nstakeholders, and (iii) getting feedback for improving the TA work and findings. The workshops \nwill be issue-oriented and are tentatively scheduled to be held at the start of the TA, halfway \nthrough the TA, and before the conference. The conference will be held toward the end of the \nTA to (i) disseminate the main findings of the TA, (ii) exchange experiences and information \nabout public ES for migrant workers within the country and those going abroad, and (iii) provide \ninputs for improving and finalizing the main report.  \n \n16.   A study visit will be held early in the TA implementation. The participants will be officials \nfrom central and provincial government who make and implement policies relating to public ES \nfor migrant workers. The visit will allow these key officials to (i) experience good practice \nfirsthand  in  a  country  with  rich  experience  in  migrant-worker  issues,  and  (ii)  exchange \nexperiences and lessons learned with officials from other countries.  \n \n ", "  5\n17.  The TA will work with MOLSS to address issues of concern at the central level, and will \nfocus on Shandong, Shanxi, and Sichuan provinces, which have typical employment issues \nrelating to migrant workers, to address provincial and local level issues.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $450,000 equivalent, of which $300,000 will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government\u2019s  contribution, \nestimated at $150,000 equivalent, will be in kind and will cover remuneration of counterpart \nstaff, office space, furniture, administrative support, and logistics. Detailed cost estimates are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented in 10 months, from December 2006 to October 2007. \nMOLSS will be the Executing Agency, and the China Employment Training Technical Instruction \nCenter (CETTIC), which is affiliated with MOLSS, will be the Implementing Agency. MOLSS and \nCETTIC  will  coordinate  with  provincial  government  agencies  to  ensure  the  timely \nimplementation of all TA activities. ADB will establish an advance payment facility with CETTIC \nto facilitate the timely implementation of TA activities. A project advisory committee, consisting \nof representatives from MOF, NDRC, and MOLSS, will provide overall guidance and supervise \nthe TA implementation.  \n20.  The  TA  will  require  29  person-months  of  consulting  services,  to  be  provided \nintermittently  during  the  implementation.  The  consultants  will  comprise  one  international \nconsultant (3 person-months) and four national consultants with expertise and experience in (i) \nES policies, systems, and implementation; (ii) employment policies for migrant workers; (iii) \nvocational guidance; and (iv) labor market information and ICT systems and networks. The \ninternational consultant will be the team leader and one of the national consultants will be the \ndeputy team leader. The consultants will be recruited individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Employment  Services  for  Migrant \nWorkers, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
