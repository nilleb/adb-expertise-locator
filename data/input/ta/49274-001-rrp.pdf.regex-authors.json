I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $45,000,000 in the Creador III L.P. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Description. Creador III L.P., a Mauritius registered limited partnership, is a closed-end \nprivate  equity fund  with  a  target  capitalization  of  $450 million.  The general  partner  will  be \nCreador Management III Limited, a Mauritius registered company.  \n \n3.  The general partner will enter into investment advisory agreements with advisors selected \nby  the  general  partner  to  provide  investment  advice  and  other  administrative  support  in \nconnection with the fund (collectively the investment advisor). The general partner will establish \nan advisory board comprising representatives of the limited partners selected by the general \npartner. The advisory board will provide advice and counsel as requested by the general partner \nin connection with the fund\u2019s investments, potential conflicts of interest, and other fund matters. It \nis expected that ADB will have the right to appoint a member to the advisory board. The fund, the \ngeneral partner and the investment advisor are collectively referred to as Creador. \n \n4.  Investment identification. As part of its market-mapping exercise of private equity fund \ninvestment  opportunities  within  the  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  ADB  identified  Creador  as  a  high  potential  private  equity  firm \ninvesting in middle-market companies in South and Southeast Asia. In June 2014, ADB initiated \ndialogue with Creador and since then has followed the firm\u2019s platform with increasing interest as \nCreador operates in geographic regions and sectors that align with ADB\u2019s mandate. ADB was \nalso attracted to Creador\u2019s record of generating attractive co-investment opportunities for its \nlimited partners, particularly in underserved markets in Southeast Asia that ADB is keen to \nsupport. \n \n5.  Creador follows a middle-market-focused, multi sector investment strategy that fits well \nwith ADB\u2019s criteria for private equity fund investments. In Indonesia and Malaysia, Creador was \none of the early firms to set up a private equity fund and, thereby, has been able to position itself \nas one of the leading private equity fund managers by leveraging its sizable local teams to \nidentify attractive investment opportunities before other investors enter the market. In India, \nCreador targets middle-market companies, a niche segment for private equity funds, as this is a \nmarket  that  is  increasingly  dominated  by  larger  private  equity  funds  pursuing  large  buyout \nopportunities. Importantly, Creador\u2019s middle-market focus offers significant development impact \npotential through investments across multiple DMCs, including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines, and Sri Lanka. Given Creador\u2019s competitive advantage in terms of performance \nrecord, regional reach (including a sizeable regional platform with local teams and a dedicated \nplatform for operations), access to direct proprietary deal flow, and investor base, ADB considers \nCreador III to be a high-quality investment opportunity for ADB\u2019s private equity portfolio. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n6.  The fund will make equity and equity-linked investments in middle-market companies that \ncater  primarily  to  middle-income  segments  in  South  and  Southeast  Asia,  including  India, \nIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. Within these segments Creador III will ", "2 \nconcentrate on three broad investment themes: (i) financial services (e.g., banks and finance \ncompanies);  (ii)  consumer  goods  and  services  (e.g.,  health  care  and  education);  and  \n(iii) business services (e.g., business-to-business services, outsourcing, payment processing, \nand logistics). \n \n7.  Creador  III  aims  to  provide  growth  capital  to  leading  established  middle-market \ncompanies with high growth prospects and the potential to gain or consolidate significant market \nshare in their respective industries. The fund proposes to target more than 10 equity investments \nof approximately $10 million or more each, while investing no more than 20% of its committed \ncapital into any one asset. The fund will generally seek to become a minority partner in investee \ncompanies and anticipates holding the investments for 3\u20135 years to allow the assets to be \ndivested in an orderly manner. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n8.  Ownership. The fund is organized in Mauritius as a limited partnership that will comprise \nstrategic  investors,  foundations,  family  offices,  and  other  institutional  investors.  The  Global \nForum  on  Transparency  and  Exchange  of  Information  for  Tax  Purposes  has  categorized \nMauritius as largely compliant with internationally agreed tax standards.1 The fund holds a tax \nresidency  certificate  issued  by  the  Mauritius  revenue  authorities,  and  its  investments  are \nexpected to benefit from India\u2013Mauritius double taxation treaty arrangements in line with market \npractice for similar funds investing in India. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s review of the fund does not give ADB cause to believe that it has been established \nor is being used for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing in the \njurisdictions involved in the investment. \n \n10.  Management. The fund will be managed by the general partner. Creador is led by its \nchief executive officer and founder, Brahmal Vasudevan, formerly of ChrysCapital, one of the \nlargest private equity firms in India. In 2011, B. Vasudevan left ChrysCapital to start Creador in \nhis home country of Malaysia. The Creador III management team also includes two senior \nmanaging directors, Cyril Noerhadi and Anand Narayan; managing director Kevin Loh; executive \ndirector Lim Sze Mei; and four directors: Stefanus Ade Hadiwidjaja, Amit Dabas, Akash Jain, and \nWong Pau Min. The broader investment team comprises more than 32 investment professionals \nacross four offices\u2014Chennai, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, and Manila (the most recently opened). \nCreador\u2019s  9-member  dedicated  management  team  for  operations,  Creador+,  supports  the \ninvestment team. The team members help portfolio companies develop and implement strategies \nto improve growth and profitability. \n \n11.  General partner contribution. The general partner\u2019s contribution was financed by each \nof the general partner\u2019s shareholders, including the chief executive officer and members of the \nsenior management team. This provides for strong alignment of the interests of the general \npartner with the limited partners. \n \n12.  Governance structure. The general partner typically conducts a three-stage investment \nprocess: (i) investment screening of each potential portfolio company\u2019s operations, products, \nmarket opportunity, and valuation against the fund\u2019s mandate and strategy; (ii) deal structuring \n                                                \n1  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of \nInformation  for  Tax  Purposes.  http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/exchange-of-information-on-request/peer-\nreview. Other jurisdictions categorized as largely compliant include Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, \nand the United States. ", "3 \nand due diligence; and (iii) preparation of investment proposals for presentation to the fund\u2019s \ninvestment committee. \n \n13.  The investment advisor is responsible for scanning the market to identify investment \nopportunities. Once a deal is identified as an opportunity, the investment advisor conducts a \npreliminary assessment of the market and the specific target company, and prepares a detailed \ninvestment memorandum to be presented to the general partner. \n \n14.  Once accepted, the general partner refers the investment opportunity to the investment \ncommittee.  The  committee  reviews  all  prospective  opportunities  at  weekly  meetings.  Once \ncommittee approval is received, the general partner prepares an initial term sheet, which typically \nidentifies a period of exclusivity that may vary depending on the nature of the opportunity but will \ngenerally range from 45 to 120 days. \n \n15.  Once the term sheet is executed by the general partner and the target company, the \ngeneral partner conducts a rigorous due diligence process with the assistance of the investment \nadvisor. In parallel, the general partner engages legal counsel to complete the documentation. \nThe general partner then presents the findings of the due diligence to the investment committee \nfor final approval. Once the final investment committee approval is received, the general partner \nsubmits the investment documentation to the board of the general partner for final approval and \nexecution, completion of other formalities, and the funding process. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n16.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $45,000,000 in Creador III L.P., not to \nexceed 25% of the fund\u2019s total capital commitments and not resulting in ADB being the single \nlargest investor in the fund. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n17.  Overall returns for the fund are expected to be strong, in line with return expectations for \nCreador\u2019s first two funds. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  Exit strategy. The fund has a 10-year term from initial closing, with two options to extend \nfor a maximum of one year each. The fund\u2019s exits will likely come from trade sales and initial \npublic offerings (IPOs). Trade sales will involve finding buyers among global strategic investors \nkeen to expand their presence in high-growth emerging economies. IPOs are also envisioned to \nprovide liquidity for the fund\u2019s minority investment positions where the sponsors plan to remain \ninvested for the long term. \n \n19.  Reporting  arrangements.  The  general  partner  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly \nunaudited  reports;  and  (ii)  audited  annual  reports,  including  financial  statements,  a  fund \noverview, and an overview of the portfolio with brief information on each portfolio company\u2019s \nperformance and valuation. ADB will review this information and follow up with the general \npartner if more information or clarification is needed. If the information received from the general \n ", "4 \npartner raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in the fund, ADB could \ndecide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent review and closer attention. \n \n20.  The general partner will be required to adopt an environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS) acceptable to ADB prior to its first disbursement, and to report annually on \nenvironmental and social safeguard issues and development effectiveness indicators. ADB will \nmonitor the receipt and quality of the ESMS reports, and offer guidance should the general \npartner require clarification of ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n21.  Catalyze  private  sector  investment.  Asian  mainstream  investors  have  traditionally \nfocused on larger regional funds and/or country-specific funds, and have limited interest in \ninvesting in smaller, regional funds, particularly in Southeast Asia. The middle market is also a \nspecialized segment within the private equity asset class, with limited distribution and visibility \namong institutional investors. ADB\u2019s participation in the fund is, therefore, expected to raise the \nvisibility of the capital needs in the fund\u2019s targeted core sectors and market segments. ADB\u2019s \nintervention is expected to catalyze both institutional and non-institutional participation in private \nequity funds investing in middle market companies in South and Southeast Asian markets where \nprivate equity fund activity is still in nascent stages. \n \n22.  Raise standards. ADB is expected to be the first multilateral partner in Creador\u2019s funds, \nand is expected to encourage the general partner to ensure that its investee companies comply \nwith the highest environment and social safeguard standards, and to report on development \nindicators. ADB\u2019s role, along with other members of the fund\u2019s advisory board, will be to assist in \nproviding  oversight  on  important  governance  matters  that  are  critical  for  companies  to \ndemonstrate as they seek additional sources of growth capital from institutional and/or individual \ninvestors. \n \nE.  Risks \n23.  Deal sourcing. The proposed investment has a strong rationale, the realization of which, \nhowever, depends on the development of a larger deal pipeline for Creador III. Given that \nCreador I is 100% deployed and Creador II is 79% deployed to date, there is confidence that \nCreador III will also be able to successfully deploy capital across target markets given Creador\u2019s \ndeep local presence in India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Regardless, ADB expects submission of \nan expanded transaction pipeline from Creador before financial close. \n \n24.  Fund raising. Comfort is taken from the fact that Creador has successfully raised two \nfunds in the recent past \u2013 $130 million for Creador I (2011) and $331 million for Creador II (2014) \nand is confident of reaching its target size of $450 million for Creador III by final close. To the \nextent Creador III is unable to reach its target fund size of $450 million, ADB will seek to cap its \ncommitment to Creador III at the lower of 10% of committed capital and $45 million. \n \n25.  Fund track record. Creador funds have a relatively untested track record. The Creador \nteam completed two successful exits (from India and Malaysia) out of 17 investments under \nCreador I and II within 2\u20133 years from investment date. While this is promising, Creador I and II \nare relatively young vintages in markets that have experienced steady positive growth in real \ngross  domestic  product. The  team takes  comfort from  the fact  that the  sensitivity  analysis \nundertaken on underlying investments in Creador I and II demonstrates that entry multiples for \ninvestees have a buffer for downside risks.    ", "5 \n \n26.  Key person risk. The market for experienced investment professionals in Southeast Asia \nis highly competitive, and the loss of one or more senior professionals from either the general \npartner or the portfolio companies may adversely impact the performance of the fund. The \ngeneral  partner\u2019s  current  investment  team  has  a  long  history  of  working  together,  and \ndiscussions indicate the risk of members leaving this group is low. The due diligence confirmed \nthat carried interest compensation is adequately distributed among Creador\u2019s senior investment \nteam,  which  would  help  Creador  retain  its  investment  staff  for  the  long  term.  \nTo help mitigate the risk of key professionals leaving portfolio companies, Creador can leverage \nits extensive local professional network developed since its establishment in 2011 in Southeast \nAsia to assist in recruiting professionals to fill key positions if necessary. \n \n27.  Exit  risk.  The  fund  expects  to  exit  investments  through  trade  sales  and  IPOs.  As \nmentioned earlier, Creador has a relatively limited track record of realizing exits, having fully \nexited only two investments. Prior to committing to investments, Creador\u2019s investment team is \nrequired to identify time frames for an exit and multiple exit strategies. To further mitigate exit \nrisks, prospects are monitored continually for all investments, and portfolio companies\u2019 relevant \nmetrics  are  tracked  (e.g.,  financial,  operating,  and  market  positions)  to  help  optimize  exit \nopportunities.  \n \n28.  Foreign exchange risk. Contributions and distributions to and from the fund will be \ndenominated in US dollars, while investments may be made in currencies other than the US \ndollar. Therefore, investments may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange \nrates, changes in monetary policy, and foreign exchange control regulations. The fund does not \nintend to reduce foreign exchange risk through hedging or other financial derivative instruments \ndue to prohibitively high costs in the relevant markets. To cushion its returns against exchange \nrate  impacts,  Creador aims  to  use  natural  hedges (e.g.,  targeting  portfolio  companies  with \nforeign currency earnings) and structure deals with downside protection from foreign exchange \nmovements whenever possible. \n \n29.  Legal, tax, and regulatory risks. Many private sector laws and regulations in the target \nmarkets are at an early stage of development, and may not provide adequate protection of the \nfund\u2019s  rights  as  a  shareholder  in  the  event  of  disputes.  The  administration  of  laws  and \nregulations by the governments in target countries may be inconsistent. In some countries, legal \nframeworks are vague and subject to interpretation. The extensive experience of the fund\u2019s \nmanagement team and its advisory board in India, Indonesia and Malaysia, drawn from previous \nprofessional  experience  and  existing  Creador  transactions,  provides  comfort  that  investee \ncompanies are top industry players that are aware of regulatory risks. Creador\u2019s locally-based \nteams  are  also  expected  to  provide  market  intelligence  to  senior  management  of  investee \ncompanies on decisions impacting continued investment or exits to mitigate regulatory risks.     \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n30.  Impact. The impact will be increased private equity funding in the Asian middle-market \nsegment. The fund\u2019s success is expected to catalyze additional private equity funding in ADB \nDMCs, which is measured by the increase in private equity funding in Asia. \n \n31.  Outcome. The investment will demonstrate the financial sustainability of private equity \ninvestments in the Asian middle-market segment. The provision of finance through the private \n ", "6 \nequity modality to middle-market companies and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in \nthe target sectors and geographic areas is expected to enhance risk-adjusted financial returns. \nThe fund estimates that at least 75% of its portfolio companies will target increased availability of \ncapital to middle-market companies. At the conclusion of the project, the fund will exit 100% of its \ninvestment portfolio at a minimum IRR of 8%. As indirect and qualitative measures, the fund also \nexpects  to  improve  the  corporate  governance  and  transparency  of  its  investee  companies \nwherever possible, and to contribute to increased job creation and tax revenue for host countries. \n \n32.  Outputs. A private equity fund will be established with a target size of $450 million \nfocused on the middle-income segment and three main investment themes: (i) financial services, \n(ii) consumer goods and services, and (iii) business services. The fund aims to mobilize capital \nfrom a diversified base of Asian and western institutional investors and invest in companies \nacross South and Southeast Asia, including in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and \nSri Lanka. The fund reached its first close of approximately $207 million in July 2015, and will be \nconsidered successful if it commences fund operations by the first quarter of 2016 and deploys \nits capital within the proposed 5-year investment period. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n33.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The proposed investment in the \nfund  aligns  well  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  which  seeks  to  promote  inclusive  growth.2 \nAccordingly, the fund intends to invest in financial services by increasing the capacity of financial \nintermediaries to expand lending to middle market companies and low- and middle-income \nconsumers, which is essential to ensure sustainable private-sector-led growth. The fund plans to \ninvest in health-care businesses, including those that support delivery of more cost-effective \nhealth services and goods. In addition, the fund proposes to participate in secondary and tertiary \neducation institutes, thereby helping to improve access to and quality of skills development in \ntarget  markets  to  reduce  skills  shortages.  These  targeted  investments  are  consistent  with \nCreador's prior funds, Creador I and Creador II, wherein several investments align with the first \npillar of the strategic framework on inclusive economic growth. These include (i) an affordable \nhousing company in India, (ii) a tertiary education center that aims to improve the quality of \nhealth-care professional skills (medical and pharmacy) in Malaysia, and (iii) a housing finance \ncompany in India focusing on underpenetrated nonmetropolitan areas. Finally, the fund supports \nADB\u2019s vision of expanding its partnerships with a diverse group of stakeholders to maximize \nreturns as well as the development impact potential of its investments. \n \n34.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  fund\u2019s \ninvestment goals strongly align with ADB strategies for encouraging the development of private \nsector  middle  market  companies  (including  SMEs),  removing  barriers  to  financing  for  such \ncompanies, and promoting social and inclusive growth.3 Furthermore, the fund\u2019s investments are \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s plan for finance sector operations, which prioritizes the need to enhance \naccess  to finance for middle market  companies  as  part  of the finance  sector  development \nagenda, and the need to support the three key pillars of the real economy: households, SMEs, \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2008.

", "7 \nand infrastructure. 4 The fund\u2019s exit strategy includes IPOs and trade sales, which are expected \nto contribute to the development of local capital markets in the investee countries. \n \n35.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  ADB  has  accumulated  several  lessons  from \nmanaging its legacy private equity fund portfolio. These include reducing exposure to (i) first-\ntime, small funds; (ii) single country funds; and (iii) emerging fund managers without an exit track \nrecord. Consequently, ADB made a deliberate choice in selecting a fund manager with a large \nregional fund mandate. ADB views this fund as an opportunity to increase its portfolio exposure \nto Southeast Asian markets, financial services, and more recent fund vintages. While recognizing \nthat Creador is relatively new in the Asian private equity market, ADB takes comfort from the \nsignificant track record of B. Vasudevan, Creador\u2019s chief executive officer. At his previous firm \nChrysCapital, a leading growth capital private equity firm focused on India, B. Vasudevan was \none of three senior managing partners responsible for investing over $2 billion in more than 45 \ninvestments  over  multiple  economic  and  market  cycles.  He  also  successfully  helped \nChrysCapital raise five successive funds, growing its assets under management from $64 million \nto $2 billion with vintages ranging from 1999 to 2007. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), ADB\u2019s equity investment is \nclassified category FI, based on potential impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand  indigenous  peoples.  The  fund  will  exclude  from  ADB  financing  any  investment  rated \ncategory  A  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  proposed  investment's  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts, the risks associated with the fund\u2019s existing and/or likely future \nportfolio,  and  its  commitment  and  capacity  strengthening  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement were assessed. The operations of the fund are not expected to have significant \nimpacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  In  the  unlikely  event  of  any \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples' impacts, the ESMS will provide guidance on \nmatters pertaining to due diligence and corrective actions. The fund will apply ADB's prohibited \ninvestment  activities  list  and  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds  are  compliant  with \napplicable national laws and regulations. The fund\u2019s ESMS will be updated by enhancing the \nscreening and due diligence process, and including ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguards \nclassification,  and  monitoring  and  reporting  requirements.5 ADB  has  also  discussed  the \npossibility of its safeguard team providing periodic environmental and social safeguard training to \nthe relevant Creador personnel to strengthen the fund\u2019s environmental and social safeguards \ncapabilities. The ESMS will be updated to meet ADB requirements before the first disbursement. \nThe training would include ADB\u2019s screening process, project categorization system, knowledge \nsharing on local and national environment and social laws and regulations, and environmental \nissues associated with the fund\u2019s pipeline.6  \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2011. Financial Sector Operational Plan. Manila. \n5  A corrective action plan will be required to be implemented for subprojects if gaps are identified during the due \ndiligence. Creador\u2019s strategy is to take minority stakes with board seats in investee companies to allow them to work \nwith management in implementing necessary operational and environment, social and governance improvements \n(e.g., Corrective Action Plans). \n6  Details of the safeguard and social dimensions and recommended improvements to the ESMS, which have been \nagreed with the fund, are in the Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System (accessible \nin the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n37.  No specific gender measures are integrated into the project design, thus it is classified as \nno gender elements. The operations of the fund are not expected to cause any specific cultural \nor social impacts or exclude any socioeconomic group, including women, from benefits. The fund \nwill comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy, will take \nmeasures to comply with the internationally recognized  core labor standards.7 The fund will \nreport regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. \nInformation disclosure and consultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance \nwith applicable ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n38.  The fund, the general partner, and the investment advisor were advised of ADB\u2019s policy \nof implementing best international practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, \nand the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes \nappropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; \nand remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n39.  The proposed equity investment is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle investment exposure limits for non-sovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n40.
