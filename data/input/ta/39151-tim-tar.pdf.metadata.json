Technical  assistance  (TA)  to  strengthen  project  management  in  Timor-Leste\u2019s \ninfrastructure ministries has concept clearance.1 A joint Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID) TA Fact-Finding and Design Mission \nvisited Dili from 23 October to 10 November 2006. The Minister of Planning and Finance signed \nthe fact-finding mission memorandum of understanding, which describes the proposed TA. The \nTA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ADB and AusAID will cofinance the \nproposed TA.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Budgeting  for  National  Development.  The  Government  of  Timor-Leste\u2019s  National \nDevelopment Plan (NDP) 2002 sets clear medium- and long-term targets for the delivery of \ninfrastructure and social services. The annual national budget process is guided by these NDP \ntargets and by the poverty reduction strategy contained in the NDP. Each line ministry each \nyear updates a 5-year rolling sector investment program (SIP) for its particular sector and \nprepares  an  annual  action  plan.  These  program  budgeting  exercises  underpin  the \nGovernment\u2019s  annual  budget  bill  submitted  to  Parliament.  Each  national  budget  therefore \ncontains a rigorous developmental and poverty reduction rationale. But the rationale is valid only \nto the extent that the capital budget is spent and produces the intended outputs. Capital budgets \nare significantly under-spent in Timor-Leste; therefore, infrastructure-related NDP and poverty \nreduction targets are at risk. \n \n3.  Development Priorities. Against a background of ongoing political instability and civil \nunrest, the Government is working with the United Nations and other development partners to \nprepare a development compact setting out priorities for government, development partner, and \nother  stakeholder  programs.  Rebuilding  security  and  judicial  institutions  are  the  highest \npriorities.  While  the  primary  underlying  causes  of  the  2006  violence  were  political  and \ninstitutional, discontent associated with poverty and the lack of jobs also contributed. Therefore, \nthe Government also ranks increased public capital spending as a high development priority. \nIndeed, the former Government had before the crisis announced it would more than quadruple \nthe capital development budget from a net $28 million in financial year 2005/06 (FY2006) to \nalmost $120 million in FY2007. The then Prime Minister explained that, with private investment \nlikely to be sluggish for some years, the Government would take the lead to make the economy  \ngrow at a target 8% per annum to create jobs sufficient to absorb school leavers and others. \nThe strategy requires the Government to execute larger capital works programs.  \n \n4.  Medium-Term Capital Expenditure Program (Supplementary Appendix A).2 Public \nsector capital expenditure over the next 5 years (2007\u20132012) could total approximately $1 \nbillion, with expenditure due to reach around $150 million in 2007\u20132008 and averaging over \n$200 million a year over the following 4 years. The Government\u2019s own consolidated budget will \naccount for just under half the total of capital works funding over the next 5 years, with the \nproposed Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) program accounting for almost a third, and \nother official development assistance a fifth of total support. \n \n5.  Capital Budget Execution (Supplementary Appendix A). The Government spent 6.5% \nof its net capital development budget in FY2006: $1.83 million out of $28 million. It may have \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 February 2007.  \n2  Supplementary appendixes are available upon request. \n ", "2   \n \nalso spent up to about $6 million of its accumulated capital budget carryovers from prior years.3 \nThe three infrastructure ministries\u2015Ministry of Public Works (MoPW), Ministry of Transport and \nCommunications  (MoTC),  and  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources,  Minerals,  and  Energy  Policy \n(MoNRMEP)\u2015were allocated over a third of the Government\u2019s total capital development budget \nin FY2006. MoPW received 24% of the total FY2007 capital budget allocation. MoNRMEP spent \nnot quite 13% of its FY2006 capital budget, MoTC almost 4%, and MoPW just less than 3%.4 \nNevertheless, the FY2007 capital development budget quadrupled to $119.7 million, of which \n$1.25 million had been spent after the first 6 months and probably around $3 million of capital \ndevelopment carryovers. MoPW, MoTC, and MoNRMEP were allocated $55.2 million for capital \ndevelopment in FY2007 (49% of the Government\u2019s combined capital development budget) of \nwhich almost 2% had been spent after 6, albeit difficult, months. There is also a backlog of \noutstanding payments to contractors.  \n \n6.  Impact of Low Capital Budget Execution. Unspent capital budget allocations translate \ninto  impassable  roads  and  river  crossings,  unhealthy  and  unsafe  urban  neighborhoods, \ncompromised  safety  and  service  standards  at  the  national  airport,  patchy  communications \nservices and coverage, intermittent supply and variable quality of electricity in cities and towns \nand scant rural electricity, and unreliable water supplies in towns and villages (Supplementary \nAppendixes B, C, and D give capital program details). Poor infrastructure is also possibly \nimpeding private sector investment and reducing access to basic social services. Finally, and \nthis was highlighted by the violence perpetrated by urban youth in 2006, the capital works \nprogram was creating too few jobs.  \n \n7.  Overcoming Project Implementation Constraints. A World Bank mission in July 2006 \nidentified (i) centralized and bureaucratic processes, and (ii) limited human capacity in line \nministries as underlying budget execution constraints. The Government passed Decree Law \n14/2006, increasing the line ministry procurement maximum from $10,000 to $100,000, to help \novercome the first constraint. Since the National Procurement Directorate of the Ministry of \nPlanning and Finance (MoPF) still handles larger procurements, the AusAID-supported MoPF \nCapacity  Building  Project  provides  budget  execution  advisors  in  the  directorate.  The \nGovernment\u2019s Planning and Financial Management Capacity Building Program supported by \nmultiple funding agencies, also has the scope to strengthen budget execution. In addition, a \ntighter Government position on carrying over unspent budget items into the new FY2008 budget \nis motivating line ministries to accelerate procurement. Finally, the Government has established \na technical commission for budget execution, to help the Council of Ministers scrutinize budget \nexecution performance.   \n \n8.  Infrastructure  Ministries:  While  some  line  ministries  have  been  reorganized  to \nstreamline their procurement functions, overcoming the second constraint (para. 7) in the short \nterm  requires  outside  resources.  Infrastructure  ministries  can  generally  cope  with  routine \noperations and maintenance and modest capital projects using ministry staff and equipment, but \nthey lack technical staff experienced in outsourcing large or complex or specialized capital \nworks programs. Outsourcing of design and construction is a new approach for some ministries; \nand programs are now larger. MoPW has approximately 55 consultant and civil work contracts \nprogrammed  for  FY2007,  and  a  total  of  $109  million  programmed  for  FY2007\u20132010 \n(Supplementary Appendix B). MoPW will directly procure only some of these contracts but will \nhandle all of the project scoping, preparation of terms of reference for consulting services \ncontracts (both design and supervision), preparation of bid documents, and management of \n                                                 \n3  Expenditure of carryovers is not clearly reported by MoPF. Accumulated carryovers across all categories totaled \n$19.5 million at end-June 2005. Of that amount, $11.3 million was spent during FY2006. Up to half of it may have \nbeen for capital development.  \n4  Treasury Directorate, MoPF. 2006. Full Year Budget Execution Report, 2005\u20132006. Dili. ", "  3\nboth consulting and civil works contracts. The ministry\u2019s Directorate of Roads, Bridges, and \nFlood Control, which would handle most of these contracts, has two degree-level qualified \nengineers who are experienced in documentation and contract management, whereas the case- \nload requires 5\u20136 experienced project management engineers and procurement officers. MoTC \nhas  approximately  42  capital  development  projects  programmed  for  FY2007  and  a  total \nprogram of almost $21 million for FY2007\u20132010, with the likelihood of significant increases \n(Supplementary Appendix C). The four technical officers assigned to MoTC\u2019s new Procurement \nDivision  need  on-the-job  support  from  qualified  and  experienced  procurement  specialists. \nMoNRMEP\u2019s infrastructure responsibilities are for water supply and sanitation, and for power \n(Supplementary Appendix D). The National Directorate of Water and Sanitation should receive \nenough project planning, preparation, and contract management support through AusAID and \nADB-assisted  projects  to  handle  its  caseload,  although  this  should  be  closely  monitored. \nElectricity of Timor-Leste (EDTL) has 24 small power distribution contracts and several larger \nbiomass  generation  contracts  programmed  for  FY2007.  MoNRMEP\u2019s  new  management \ncontract for EDTL and technical support from the World Bank and the Government of Norway \nwill not fully cover EDTL\u2019s project management needs. Staff in MoNRMEP\u2019s new Procurement \nDivision will need on-the-job support from qualified and experienced procurement specialists.  \nStrengthening fiduciary controls and financial management in line ministries would also improve \nthe quality and pace of project implementation. More programming and financial specialists are \nneeded to produce technically and financially sound annual budget submissions to MoPF, and \nskilled  use  of  the  Government\u2019s  general  ledger,  \u201cFreeBalance\u201d  software,  would  improve \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) of program execution. The AusAID-supported MoPF Capacity \nBuilding Project has budget execution advisors in MoPW, MoTC, and MoNRMEP. \n \n9.  Safeguards  and  Risks.  MoPW,  MoTC,  and  MoNRMEP  have  little  expertise  in \nmanaging environmental and social safeguards for projects (Supplementary Appendix E). Line \nministries lack know-how in gender and development, conflict management and mitigation, \nHIV/AIDS, involuntary resettlement and compensation, and indigenous persons and vulnerable \ngroups. MoPW does not have an environmental impact assessment unit. Environmental Impact \nAssessment  legislation  is  before  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  the  National  Directorate  of \nEnvironment is recruiting staff. An overall risk management matrix for the proposed TA is at \nSupplementary Appendix F. Special reference is made to the United States Government\u2019s \nMillennium Challenge Account (MCA) Timor-Leste program (Supplementary Appendix G). The \nMCA program and the proposed TA will likely be at least partly concurrent, and they will both \nsupport infrastructure development. They can be complementary, but there is a risk that a large \nMCA program could further overstretch the Government\u2019s project management capacity and \nTimor-Leste\u2019s  consulting  and  contracting  industries.  The  Government  will  mitigate  risks  by \nrelying  heavily  on  \u2018outsourcing\u2019,  by  streamlined  project  management  processes,  and  by \ninstituting National budget rules that encourage line-ministries to concentrate on executing their \nregular capital development allocations. \n \n10.  Lessons. \u201cStay engaged long enough to give success a chance\u201d is one of 12 principles \nof good engagement with weakly performing countries.5 This is a pivotal capacity building \nlesson from post-conflict Timor-Leste. There may only be 4\u20135 degree-level engineers in total \nrecruited annually into the three infrastructure ministries. Diploma-level (polytechnic) engineers \nwould have difficulty absorbing on-the-job training for procuring and administering large or \ncomplex contracts. This underscores the need for a long-term approach to building budget \nexecution capacity in MoPW, MoTC, and MoNRMEP (Supplementary Appendix H). Capacity- \nbuilding experiences globally, particularly in Timor-Leste, highlight the need to engage advisors \nwith a capacity-building mindset and skills. Their terms of reference should explicitly require \n                                                 \n5 Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.  \n ", "4   \n \ncapacity building, and a structure or discipline should be introduced by requiring long-term \nconsultants to develop a capacity-building plan early in their assignment. Technical specialists \nmust be responsible for achievements in their part of the capacity-building plan, and not yield \nresponsibility to a designated capacity-building specialist and team leader. A key lesson learned \nfrom infrastructure projects in Timor-Leste is that contractor performance must be intensively \nmonitored to ensure quality and timely progress. Subcontractors should be closely scrutinized \nand the principal contractor must retain effective site management.   \n \n11.  Strategic Considerations. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update 2006\u20132008 for \nTimor-Leste6 focuses on infrastructure support and leadership. The strategy and program aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009,7 which has key results areas for providing infrastructure \nand improving water supply and sanitation. Infrastructure development and management have \nbeen the backbone of ADB operations in Timor-Leste since 2000 and remain appropriate. The \nGovernment of Australia\u2019s March 2006 White Paper on Overseas Aid, \u201cBetter Aid for a Better \nFuture\u201d, recommended new investments in key areas in AusAID programs. This included an \n\u201cInfrastructure for Growth Initiative\u201d, focusing particularly on infrastructure in rural areas and on \nstrengthening the systems to enable sustainable partner government delivery of infrastructure. \nGiven Timor-Leste\u2019s context of considerable available budget and limited execution capacity, \nAusAID is eager to support a joint approach with ADB in addressing immediate infrastructure \nprocurement  capacity  needs  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  own  infrastructure  budget.  The \nprogram  would  coordinate  with  Australia\u2019s  other  ongoing  support  for  public  financial \nmanagement in Timor-Leste.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The expected impact of the TA is enhanced opportunities for economic participation, and \nimproved access to basic social services for all East Timorese. The expected outcome is  \ninfrastructure assets created and upgraded in line with medium-term NDP targets, including \ntransport,  communications,  urban  development,  power,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation. \nSustaining the outcome will require an 8\u201310-year project horizon. Project support will initially \nconcentrate on preparing and procuring capital projects for implementation with a focus on \nhands-on technical assistance. The project will progress to more capacity-building support that \nshould continue through to a second 4-year program.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  Component  1:  Implementing  Capital  Development  Programs.  The  TA  will  help \nMoPW, MoTC, and MoNRMEP (i) prepare and procure contracts for consulting services, goods, \nand works in line with annual capital development work plans; and (ii) manage implementation \nof these contracts8 (Supplementary Appendixes B, C, and D). Specialists provided by the TA \nwill be assigned to MoPW, MoTC, and MoNRMEP. Project management engineers will work in \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n8  The TA scope does not include capital development programming (before project implementation) or infrastructure \noperations and maintenance (after project implementation). Other programs will provide this support: (i) budget \nexecution advisors and sector investment program advisors from the AusAID-supported MoPF Capacity Building \nProject and the Public Sector Capacity Development Program, and later, advisors from the multi-donor Planning \nand Financial Management Capacity Building Program; and (ii) operations and maintenance support from AusAID \n(water supply and sanitation\u2013WSS), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA \u2013 power, WSS, and roads \nand bridges), ADB (WSS, and roads and bridges), and the World Bank (power). ", "  5\nthe various technical directorates and planning and design divisions. They will help prepare \ntechnical documentation, which will then be passed on to the procurement units. The procured \ncontracts will then be handed back to the project management engineers for implementation. \nProcurement  specialists  will  work  in  the  various  finance  and  administration  and  corporate \nservices directorates of the three infrastructure ministries. Using documentation provided by the \ntechnical units, the procurement specialists will help procure contracts directly or finalize bid \ndocuments  and  send  them  to,  and  assist  the  National  Procurement  Directorate  of  MoPF. \nProcured contracts will then be passed back to the technical units for implementation. The \nprocurement  specialists  will  also  help  with  financial  and administration  aspects  of contract \nmanagement. TA specialists will comprise both long-term, full-time and intermittent consultants \nwho will remain attached to their respective ministries for the duration of the TA, together with a \npool of specialists, who can be called upon to provide particular skills on a short-term basis, for \nexample, materials engineers; information, communications, and technology specialists; traffic \nsignals specialists; contract lawyers; and so on. The \u2018pool\u2019 of short-term consultants will also \ninclude environmental and social safeguard specialists. At the start of each year, the long-term \nproject management engineers will identify likely environmental and social safeguard issues \nwithin  their  annual  program.  Safeguard  issues  and  required  specialist  expertise  will  be \nconfirmed, and later monitored, by a safeguards specialist (long-term intermittent) assisting the \nTA team leader.   \n \n14.  Component 2: Building Project Management Capacity (Supplementary Appendix H). \nThe  TA  will  provide  a  full-time  capacity-building  and  training  specialist  to  oversee  the \npreparation, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of a staged capacity-building \nplan  for  project  management  in  each  of  MoPW,  MoTC,  and  MoNRMEP.  Each  long-term \ninternational specialist will help prepare a staged capacity-building plan for his/her ministry/unit. \nThese tailored strategies will underpin progression from operational support to capacity building, \nwhich will be formalized by the TA management team during the first year of TA implementation.    \n \n15.  Monitoring and Evaluation and TA Management: The TA will provide a long-term \nintermittent  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist  to  oversee  TA  effectiveness  and  results \nmanagement  in  accordance  with  the  targets  and  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework. The TA\u2019s M&E will draw on the approaches and systems used in the AusAID-\nsupported  MoPF  Capacity  Building  Program  and  the  multi-agency  Planning  and  Financial \nManagement Capacity Building Program. The TA will provide a full-time team leader and public \nworks institutional specialist.   \n \n16.  The following table shows the initial deployment of specialists.

Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $18 million. ADB will provide $3 million out of the \ntotal  cost,  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  of \nAustralia will provide $12 million equivalent on an untied grant basis to be administered by ADB. \nThe  Government  of  Timor-Leste  will  contribute  $3  million  in  kind  to  cover  mainly  office \naccommodation, transport, and remuneration of counterpart staff. ADB and AusAID cofinancing \nwill  be  on  a  joint  basis  and  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nDisbursements of Technical Assistance Grant (1992, as amended from time to time). The \ndetailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will last for 48 months, beginning August 2007 and ending in July 2011. MoPW, \nMoTC,  and  MoNRMEP  will  be  the  executing  agencies  for  the  TA,  providing  day-to-day \nimplementation  support  through  their  technical  directors  and  finance  and  administration \ndirectors who will also be the primary counterparts of the TA consultant team leader. The TA \nconsultants will work alongside the relevant division and unit heads within each of the ministries, \nusing standard ministry systems and procedures. The TA consultant team leader will provide \nmonitoring and oversight support to the directors to help ensure timely and effective reporting to \nministers.  The  TA\u2019s  M&E  specialist  will  manage  and  guide  M&E  support  provided  by  TA \nspecialists. The M&E specialist will also prepare and manage a plan for disseminating the \nexpected outputs and outcome evaluation. The TA will be reviewed 3 months after mobilization \n(inception review) and annually thereafter (annual review). A detailed midterm review will be \ncarried out after 2 years. The reviews will be conducted jointly by the Government, AusAID, and \nADB. The TA completion report will include recommendations and a design for a second-phase \nTA. \n \n19.  The Government, AusAID, and ADB will provide strategic direction to the TA project \nthrough a project coordination committee (PCC). A minister from one of MoPW, MoTC, or \nMoNRMEP will chair the PCC on a rotating basis, and other permanent members will be a \nparticipating director from each ministry, a member from the technical commission for budget \nexecution, one representative each from ADB and AusAID, and the TA consultant team leader. \nThe PCC will invite other partners to join the committee as appropriate. The PCC will approve \nand review the annual consultant TA project work plans. The PCC will meet at least every 6 \nmonths  and  will  monitor  and  review  project  progress  against  the  TA\u2019s  key  performance \nindicators, specialist levels and performance, and any proposed changes in scope or budget.   \n \n20.  ADB will select and engage a team of international consultants (560 person-months, \ncomprising 440 person-months of long-term and 120 person-months of short-term consulting \nservices) and national consultants (110 person-months) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The TA will be led by the team \nleader and public works institutional specialist. Other international consultants are shown in the \ntable in para. 16. The outline terms of reference for the specialists are in Appendix 3. The \ninternational consulting firm will be recruited using ADB\u2019s quality-and cost-based approach \n(QCBS). The full technical proposal format will be used to invite and evaluate proposals from \ninternational consulting firms. The Government will be invited to send up to two officials to \nattend  contract  negotiations  with  the  first  ranked  consultant  firm.

The Infrastructure Project Management technical assistance (TA) will help the Ministry of \nPublic Works (MoPW), Ministry of Transport and Communications (MoTC), and Ministry of \nNatural Resources, Minerals, and Energy Policy (MoNRMEP) prepare, procure, and manage \nconsulting services, goods, and works required for their respective annual capital development \nprograms.  The  TA  comprises  two  linked  components.  Component  1\u2015executing  capital \ndevelopment  programs\u2015will  help  MoPW,  MoTC,  and  MoNRMEP  (i)  prepare  and  procure \ncontracts for consulting services, goods, and works in line with annual capital development work \nplans; and (ii) manage the implementation of these contracts. Component 2\u2015building project \nmanagement  capacity\u2015will  improve  and  strengthen  processes,  systems,  and  staff \ncompetencies for project management in the three ministries. Because the Government of \nTimor-Leste urgently needs to reduce its backlog of unexecuted capital development projects, \nand because there are few project engineers in MoPW, MoTC, and MoNRMEP who could be \nreadily  trained  in  outsourcing  services,  goods,  and  works,  the  TA  will  initially  add  to  the \nministries\u2019 project management capacity. TA project managers and procurement specialists will \nwork in-line on each ministry\u2019s caseload of contracts to be prepared, procured, and managed. \nAny \u201cadvisory\u201d role will be secondary to the in-line work. Progressively, according to a staged \ncapacity-building  plan  (SCBP),  the  TA  will  swing  more  of  its  focus  to  building  project \nmanagement  capacity  in  MoPW,  MoTC,  and  MoNRMEP.  The  TA  is  expected  to  be \nimplemented over 4 years beginning in August 2007, and with the prospect of a second-phase \nTA depending on the TA completion assessment.1\n \n2.  Technical directorates in MoPW, MoTC and MoNRMEP prepare bid documents. Bid \ndocuments are then passed on to procurement divisions in the ministries\u2019 directorates of finance \nand administration (MoPW and MoTC) or Corporate Services Directorate (MoNRMEP) where \nthe documents are checked and finalized and then tendered. Tendering is managed directly by \nthe ministry or by the National Procurement Directorate of the Ministry of Planning and Finance \n(MoPF), depending primarily on the contract size. Finally, procured contracts are passed back \nto the originating technical directorates to implement. The finance and administration/corporate \nservices directorates also have monitoring and reporting functions during contract management.  \n \n3.  At least one of the TA specialists in each ministry must be fluent in spoken and written \nEnglish, since the specialists will be required to prepare high-quality English language bid \ndocuments. Fluency in Tetum, Portuguese or Bahasa Indonesia would be an advantage.  The \nTA will provide 10 long-term international specialists (total 440 person-months), a pool of short-\nterm specialists (total 120 person-months), and long-term national consultants (110 person-\nmonths). Each specialist will be subject to a performance review after the first 3 months of \nservice and thereafter annually.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA scope does not include capital development programming or infrastructure operations and maintenance. \nOther programs will provide this support: (i) budget execution advisors and sector investment program advisors \nfrom the AusAID-supported MoPF Capacity Building Project and the Public Sector Capacity Development Program \nand, later, advisors from the multi-donor Planning and Financial Management Capacity Building Program; and (ii) \noperations and maintenance support from AusAID (water supply and sanitation\u2013WSS), the Japan International \nCooperation Agency (JICA \u2013 power, WSS, and roads and bridges), ADB (WSS, and roads and bridges), and the \nWorld Bank (power). \n \n ", "14   Appendix 3 \n \nA.
