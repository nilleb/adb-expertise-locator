INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge  and support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support the  preparation, \ndissemination, and timely application of analytical studies relating to the development of the \nlogistics industry in India.1 The TA will allow the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to swiftly \nrespond to India\u2019s demand for knowledge support on challenges and strategies  related to \nlogistics.2 The TA will also provide capacity building assistance on implementing the outputs of \nthe analytical findings. \n \n2.  Logistics development supports the objectives of India\u2019s country partnership strategy \nand  corresponding  country  knowledge  plan,  which  aim  to  boost  India\u2019s  economic \ncompetitiveness  and  expand  access to  infrastructure,  leading  to  sustained growth  and job \ncreation.3 The TA will help identify crucial and immediate investment requirements and will \npromptly translate these requirements into lending operation and investment projects, thereby \naccelerating their development impact. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  India is one of the fastest growing large economies in the world, with an average gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita growth rate of 7% per annum over the last 2 decades.4 \nDespite this rapid growth, India remains under-industrialized. Manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP \nwas only 17% in 2017, compared with 21%\u201329% in comparator countries of East and Southeast \nAsia. As a result, India\u2019s dynamic growth has not been accompanied by significant job creation.  \n \n4.  Moreover, India\u2019s trade with the rest of South Asia remains low. In 2015, the share of \nIndia\u2019s  trade  with  South  Asia  accounted  for  only  3%  of  its  total  trade.  Countries  of  the  \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, by comparison, enjoy much higher intraregional trade.5 \nMoreover, also in 2015, India\u2019s share of all global trade is just 2%\u2014well behind the 12% share \nregistered by the People\u2019s Republic of China.6 India\u2019s integration with regional and global value \nchains (GVCs) has also been limited. In 2011, India\u2019s GVC Participation Index was 43.1%, \nlower compared with Asian peers such as Malaysia (60.4%), the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(47.7%), Singapore (61.6%), Thailand (54.3%), and Viet Nam (52.3%).7 \n \n5.  Inefficient and uncompetitive logistics drive up the cost of doing business in India and \nare one of the main reasons behind the country\u2019s lagging industrial expansion.8 Improving the \nefficiency of logistics by better connecting production and consumption markets over a wider \ngeographic expanse will reduce the cost of doing business in India.   \n                                                \n1  The TA is not included in country operations business plan (ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: India, \n2018\u20132020. Manila). In a letter dated 28 November 2017, the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) officially \nrequested that ADB support the Department of Commerce (DOC) to develop the logistics industry in India. \nLogistics development was also identified as a priority area in the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nOperational Plan, 2016\u20132025. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 March 2018. \n3  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2018\u20132022. Manila. \n4  World Bank. World Development Indicators.

Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals. 2013. \nCSCMP Supply Chain Management Definitions and Glossary.  \n ", "2 \n \n \n6.  Manufacturing  is  a  major  driver  of  the  logistics  industry  in  India,  with  companies \nspending 2%\u201320% of their revenue on logistics.9 With the Government of India focused on \nreinvigorating manufacturing through initiatives such as economic corridors and investment \nzones, the logistics industry will be critical. The government expects freight movement in the \ncountry to continue its growth trajectory, with an expected annual growth rate of 8%\u201310% over \nthe next 10 years. In 2018, the logistics industry is expected to generate $360 billion in value-\nadded, up from $115 billion in 2017.10 \n \n7.  The growing recognition of the important role of logistics in India\u2019s industrialization is \nevident  in  recent  government  initiatives.  In  2015,  the  government  initiated  the  Logistics \nEfficiency Enhancement Program, which aims to support the Make in India11 campaign by \nreducing logistics costs by up to 10%. In November 2017, the government granted infrastructure \nstatus to the logistics industry, a landmark move to lure private investments into the industry by \neasing logistics firms\u2019 access to long-term credit at lower rates.  \n \n8.  Participation in GVCs in manufacturing also depends on a robust logistics industry. \nGoods moving through GVCs typically cross multiple borders during the production process. \nParts and components can be imported from different locations to the producing country for final \nassembly. Efficient logistics are necessary for firms to be able to participate cost effectively in \nthis network of activities and compete globally. \n \n9.  India\u2019s service industry also presents great opportunities for logistics. It is considered \none of the fastest growing service industries in the world\u20149.2% in 2016\u2014and its growth is \nexpected to accelerate in the coming years.12 The e-commerce industry, one of the big drivers \nof  logistics  and  physical  distribution  networks,  has  been  on  an  upward  trajectory  and  is \nexpected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 28% from 2016 to 2020, reaching $63.7 \nbillion by 2020.13  \n \n10.  However, the logistics industry in India is inefficient compared with its peer economies. \nIndia ranked relatively low in the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index, placing 35th in \n2016, behind Asian neighbors Singapore (5th); Hong Kong, China (9th); Republic of Korea \n(24th); Taipei,China  (25th);  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China (27th);  and  Malaysia  (32nd).14 \nLogistics costs in India remain high compared with developed countries. Logistics costs as a \npercentage of GDP stood at 13%\u201314% in 2015, doubling from 7%\u20138% in 2000. By comparison, \nlogistics costs in developed countries average about 8%\u201310% of GDP. In more specific terms, \nIndia\u2019s average road freight cost per ton per kilometer, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is \n$0.03, which is almost twice as much road freight costs in the United States.15   \n \n11.  One  main  cause  of  India\u2019s  lower  performance  is  the  lack  of  a  comprehensive \ndevelopment strategy for logistics. Another constraint is an inadequate multi-modal transport \n                                                \n9  Knight Frank India. 2014.

Storage  and/or \ninterchange  elements  like multimodal  logistics parks,  warehouses,  inland  container  depots, \ncontainer freight stations, and air freight stations are also lacking. In addition, logistics skills are \ndeficient, and information and communication technology is underutilized.  \n \n12.  The government needs to improve its capacity to design and implement comprehensive \nstrategies  on  logistics.  Several  aspects  of  the  logistics  industry  must  be  better  planned, \nmanaged,  and  monitored  to  overcome  institutional  silos  and  move  toward  an  integrated \napproach  to  logistics  development  in  the  country.  India\u2019s  logistics  industry  falls  under  the \npurview of multiple ministries and agencies, each of which are responsible for different modes of \ntransport and related aspects of logistics development. Legal and institutional frameworks that \nare incompatible with a modern and integrated logistics industry are another constraint. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: logistics efficiency improved.16 The TA will \nhave the following outcome: national integrated logistics development plan approved.17  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n14.  Output 1: National integrated logistics development plan prepared. The TA will \ndevelop a study agenda to respond to India\u2019s demand for knowledge solutions on logistics \ndevelopment. The study will focus on the following six building blocks, which will also be the \nbasis for an integrated logistics development plan: \n(i)  improving logistics and transport infrastructure;  \n(ii)  improving transportation assets and handling facilities; \n(iii)  reforming  institutional  structure  to  ensure  efficient  planning  and  better \ncoordination among various agencies involved with logistics;  \n(iv)  streamlining the logistics policy, regulatory, and legal framework;  \n(v)  improving skills specific to logistics needs; and  \n(vi)  building  an  information  and  communication  technology  backbone  to  simplify \nlogistics processes. \n \n15.  The integrated logistics development plan will adopt a multipronged approach to address \nthe demands of various sectors. 18 It will adopt a technical approach to infrastructure planning \nthat is consistent with India\u2019s strategy to establish logistics corridors and strengthen key product \nvalue chains.19 The integrated logistics development plan will take into consideration natural \nhazards and climate change risks.  \n \n                                                \n16 Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways.n.d.

Output 2: Capacity building on implementation of national integrated logistics \ndevelopment plan provided. Alongside provision of knowledge solutions, the TA will provide \nsupport  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  government  agencies  to  design  and  implement \ncomprehensive logistics plans that meet the demands of a modern logistics industry. This could \ninvolve  technical  support  for  reviewing  institutional  and  policy  framework,  and  regulations \naffecting logistics; implementing logistics development plans; planning and promoting logistics \nparks and related projects to potential investors; and providing incentives and a proper business \nenvironment to encourage private sector participation in logistics. The TA will provide venues for \ngovernment  agencies  to  learn  about  global  best  practices  on  logistics  development  via \nknowledge sharing arrangements among developing economies through the conduct of various \nlearning events such as workshops, forums, and seminars.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,100,000, of which (i) $1,000,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources)  and  (ii) \n$1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \nDisbursement of funds is front-loading.  \n \n18.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  workshop  venues, \ntransportation, remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff who will support the preparation \nof  the  national  integrated  development  plan  and  related  activities,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. \n \n19.  Civil works, procurement of large-scale equipment, permanent staffing costs, and the \nhiring of staff consultants are ineligible expenditures under the Republic of Korea e-Asia and \nKnowledge Partnership Fund. The items in the cost estimates and financing plan are eligible \nexpenditures under the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented from July 2018 to June 2021. ADB will administer the TA \nthrough the Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division  of the South Asia \nDepartment and the India Resident Mission.20 ADB will work closely with various government \nagencies  in  implementing  the  TA  activities.  The  South  Asia  Regional  Cooperation  and \nOperations Coordination Division and the India Resident Mission will select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n                                                \n20 In accordance with the staff instruction on business process for knowledge and support TA (clause 3), the Strategy, \nPolicy, and Review Department has confirmed that ADB, rather than the government, may act as the executing \nagency for country-specific TA projects where appropriate justifications exist. In this case, the DEA formally \nrequested ADB to support the DOC in developing the logistics industry. Logistics was granted infrastructure status \nonly in November 2017, and a new division in the DOC was created to support nationwide development of \nlogistics. The DOC and DEA requested ADB support, given ADB\u2019s experience in logistics development. ADB is \nwell equipped to lead the TA implementation and coordinate multiagency issues. The DEA has no objection to ADB \nserving as the executing agency for this TA. In the same vein, capacity building support for the DOC and relevant \nagencies will be part of the TA outputs such that future logistics projects may be implemented by the government. \n ", "5 \n \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  August 2018\u2013July 2021 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual consultants  International expertise  $730,000 \nselection  (84 person-months) \nIndividual consultants  National expertise  $480,000 \nselection  (84 person-months) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n21.
