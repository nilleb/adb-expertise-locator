During the Country Programming Mission in July 2003, the Government of Tuvalu and \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  agreed  that  ADB  would  provide  grant  funding  for  a \ntechnical assistance (TA) in 2004 to help Tuvalu prepare and deliver strategies to develop the \nquality, efficiency, and management capacity of the education sector.1 Accordingly, an ADB TA \nfact-finding mission visited Tuvalu from 24 to 28 June 2004 and reached an understanding with \nthe  Government  on  the  justification,  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA to prepare the Education \nSector Reform and Development Project.2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  With  Tuvalu\u2019s  small  population  of  9,119  (2002  census),  diseconomies  of  scale  will \nalways exist. In the case of education, (i) pupil-teacher ratios will often be inefficient; (ii) unit \ncosts for teacher training and any new curriculum and related material development will be high; \nand (iii) Department of Education (DOE) staff will need to perform multiple functions. The \ndispersal  of  the  population  across  nine  atolls  increases  the  costs  of  school  supervision, \nprocurement, and delivery of supplies. Tuvalu is also relatively isolated from major sources of \nsupply and training because flight connections are infrequent and expensive. Though poverty is \nnot considered an issue, the Government acknowledges wide disparities in access to services \nand cash income between the population in Funafuti and the outer islands.3 On 3 April 2003, the \nGovernment and ADB signed a poverty partnership agreement confirming the Government\u2019s \ncommitment to better define and assess the concept of poverty, design appropriate strategies to \nreduce poverty, and incorporate these strategies in the country\u2019s development plan. The initial \npoverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  Education System. The education structure consists of 3 years of preschool (ages 3\u20135) \nmanaged  mainly  by  parent  associations,  8  years  of  primary  (ages  6\u201313),  and  4  years  of \nsecondary (ages 14\u201317). Upon completion of year 10, students take the Fijian Junior Certificate \nexamination. Those who pass continue secondary education and take the Tuvaluan School \nCertificate in year 11 and the Pacific Senior Certificate in year 12. If successfully completed, \nstudents can be considered for tertiary education. The country has 17 registered preschools, \nnine Government-funded primary schools (one in each of the nine islands), one privately funded \nSeventh Day Adventist primary school on Funafuti, one Government-run secondary boarding \nschool in Motufoua, and the church-run Fetuvalu High School in Funafuti. The Tuvalu Maritime \nTraining Institution offers the only formal postsecondary vocational program. The University of \nthe South Pacific Extension Campus offers postsecondary education in basic foundation studies \nwith  degree  programs  and  continuing  education  available  through  distance  education. \nManagement, budgets, and curriculum are centrally controlled.  \n \n4.  The Government wants to introduce technical and vocational education and training in \njunior secondary schools at two selected locations to alleviate crowding of years 9 and 10 \nstudents  in  the  Motufoua  secondary  school.  Cost-effectiveness  of  this  plan  needs  to  be \nassessed. Alternative options, such as introducing two additional classes in outer island schools \nthat have many students, need to be evaluated. In line with Government priorities, the draft \nEducation and Training Sector Master Plan (ETSMP) focuses on (i) examining the feasibility of \n                                                 \n1 The TA is included in the 2004 country program for Tuvalu as \"Support to Secondary Education Programming.\" See \nADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004-2006): Tuvalu. Manila.  \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 January 2004.  \n3 Most communities were in agreement that poverty does not exist in Tuvalu. See ADB. 2003. National Poverty \nReduction Strategies in Pacific Developing Member Countries \u2013Tuvalu Participatory Hardship Assessment. Manila. ", " 2  \nreintroducing vocational and life skills into the islands through community training centers; and \n(ii) assessing alternative funding strategies for secondary education, including integration of \nprivate sector provisions. A financial sustainability analysis will be required before any change \ncan be considered as a viable option. \n \n5.  Access and Equity. Approximately 90% of children are enrolled in early childhood \neducation  programs,  which  operate  3  days  a  week.  The  Canada  Fund,  the  New  Zealand \nAgency  for  International  Development  (NZAID),  and  the  United  Nations  Children's  Fund \n(UNICEF) have provided support for preschool infrastructure and materials. In 2002, the net \nenrollment rate at the primary level was 100%.4 About 48% of students were female, which \nbroadly reflects the makeup of the population in the 2002 census. At the secondary level, the \nnet enrollment rate was about 63%, but the enrollment rates in years 11 and 12 were only about \n30%; no gender disparity was noted. At the postsecondary level, the Tuvalu Maritime Training \nInstitution enrolls 60 students per year providing preservice and in-service training for merchant \nmariners. About 100 students\u2014the majority from Funafuti\u2014enroll per semester in distance \neducation at the University of the South Pacific Extension Campus. For university education, the \nregional University of the South Pacific provides in-service and preservice training, while a very \nsmall  number  of  qualified  Tuvaluans  receive  scholarships  to  study  in  Australia  and  New \nZealand.  \n \n6.  Quality and Efficiency. The quality and efficiency of service delivery as measured by \nthe passing rate in the Fiji junior secondary examination fell from 61% in 1991 to 13% in 2001.5 \nThe passing rate at year 8 was down to 22% in 2003 from 49% in 2001. When students fail, the \nGovernment policy is to let them repeat year 8 once before dropping out. At the secondary level, \nhalf of the 30% of students who enroll in year 12 drop out because they fail the final exam. The \ncauses of this drastic decline in the passing rate are not entirely clear and therefore warrant \ninvestigation,  e.g.,  it  may  reflect  a  decrease  in  English  proficiency  in  an  English-medium \nexamination rather than in general academic abilities. Poor teaching, inappropriate curriculum, \ninadequately defined learning objectives, poorly designed examinations, insufficient learning \nmaterials, medium of instruction, and inadequate time-on-task are all possible contributors to \nquality decline. Much of the curriculum is borrowed with relatively little adaptation to the specific \nneeds or backgrounds of Tuvaluan children, thus making learning difficult.6 Learning objectives \nare not always clearly sequenced, and minimum learning standards are not well defined. The \ncurriculum at all levels needs improvement with regard to content, relevance, and specification \nof learning outcomes. \n \n7.  While the basic qualifications of teachers have improved substantially, this has not been \nsupported by sufficient attention to providing appropriate instructional materials. In addition, \nteachers have little opportunity to maintain and improve their basic teaching or subject mastery \nskills through in-service training. Even trained teachers, who qualify from various countries, \ncreate differentiations in teaching standards. Standardizing preservice teacher training, and \nintroducing in-service training and refresher courses are essential to raise professional morale. \nThe Tuvalu curriculum needs to be included in the preservice teacher training programs.  \n \n                                                 \n4 Net enrollment rates are calculated from the 2002 census for primary and secondary education. No system is \navailable to calculate the gross enrollment rate in one particular year. Analysis of education indicators is hindered \nby absence of reliable data.   \n5 In 2003, however, the pass rate increased to 58% after taking some drastic measures to improve school \nmanagement. DOE indicated that with the change of school principal and management, teachers\u2019 attitudes and \nmotivation changed, and consequently, the test results improved. \n6 The curriculum followed three different programs: years 9 and 10 followed the Fijian Junior Certificate; year 11 \nfollowed the Tuvalu School Certificate program, and year 12 followed the regional syllabus prepared by the South \nPacific Board for Education Assessment.  \n ", "  3\n8.  The Australian Agency for International Development supported the Tuvalu-Australia \nEducation Support Project, which developed a primary school core curriculum and introduced \nTuvalu curriculum-based textbooks. However, teachers still use old textbooks based on Fiji\u2019s \ncurriculum, in part because they lack fluency in English. Many schools lack learning materials. \nAlternative cost-effective options for developing curriculum and supplying learning materials and \ntextbooks, at least in core subjects, should be considered after resolving the issues of language \nof instruction and the language capability of teachers.  \n \n9.  Management Capacity. DOE operates under severe financial and technical constraints \nwith  only  three  full-time  professional  staff\u2014not  enough  to  provide  adequate  curriculum \ndevelopment, teacher supervision, monitoring, and planning. Even if adequate staff were in \nplace  on Funafuti,  they  might  not  be  able to  adequately  manage  the  schools, given  their \ngeographic distance and the poor communication between Funafuti and the outer islands. The \nGovernment should analyze and assess alternative solutions to these constraints, and involve \nlocal teachers and parents in school management and demand generation for quality education.  \n   \n10.  Government  Policy  and  Priorities.  The  Government  is  committed  to  achieving \nEducation for All and the Millennium Development Goals relating to education by (i) expanding \nand improving comprehensive early childhood care and education for the most vulnerable and \ndisadvantaged  children,  (ii)  ensuring  that  by  2015  all  children  have  access  to  free  and \ncompulsory primary education of good quality, (iii) meeting the learning needs of all young \npeople and adults through equitable access to appropriate learning and life-skills programs, (iv) \nachieving a 50% improvement in adult literacy by 2015, (v) eliminating gender disparities in \nbasic  education  by  2005,  and  (vi)  improving  all  aspects  of  the  quality  and  excellence  of \neducation  with  measurable  learning  outcomes.  The  Government  has  already  achieved  a \nnumber of these goals; however, it recently established a board of inquiry to examine the \ncauses of the recent poor performance of the education sector. The Government completed a \nreview  of  the  education  sector  and  formulated  the  ETSMP  to  strategically  address  sector \nissues.7 However, the role of the private sector\u2014which could provide additional education and \ntraining opportunities at no cost to the Government\u2014is not well defined in the national education \npolicy. The issues to be addressed are (i) building and strengthening complementary public-\nprivate partnerships and (ii) maximizing the role of the private sector in providing education and \ntraining.  \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy.  The  Island  Development  Program  loan  (Loan  1693-TUV \n[SF])8 helped establish the Falekaupule Trust Fund, which will provide a sustainable stream of \nfunding for development projects and for maintenance of community assets.9 The US$1.85 \nmillion loan for the Maritime Training Project and its piggybacked TA10 was approved in 2002; in \n2004, a supplementary loan of US$1.97 million was approved.11 The Project will improve the \nquality  of  education  and  training  at  the  Tuvalu  Maritime  Training  Institute  that  prepares \nseafarers for overseas employment, the main source of jobs and income for Tuvaluans in the \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2004.

Further assistance will be provided with a regional TA12 to improve the quality \nand accessibility of education, health, and telecommunication services. ADB also helped the \nGovernment formulate its ETSMP, which will provide the basis for design of the Education \nSector Reform and Development Project. The ETSMP will also provide a framework for future \nsupport by external funding agencies. \n \n12.  External  Funding.  Development  partners,  such  as  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development, Government of Canada (Canada Fund), European Union, Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  and  NZAID,  have  been  playing  important  roles  in  the \neducation sector. Their assistance has not, however, always been effectively coordinated to \nmaximize long-term impact. Better targeting and coordination among funding agencies are \nessential for more effective utilization of aid. Given the limited capacity of Tuvalu to absorb \nfunding, development assistance needs to be sequenced to optimize the impact. ADB, with \nNZAID cofinancing, has provided two consultants to work with the Government to formulate the \nETSMP and provide a framework for coordination. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n13.  The purpose of the TA is to help the Government prepare and deliver strategies to \ndevelop the quality, efficiency, and management capacity of the education sector. In particular, \nthe TA will focus on the Government's policy priorities as stated in the ETSMP and Kakeega II: \n(i) improving the quality and relevance of preprimary, primary, and secondary education; (ii) \nimproving the efficiency of schooling by reducing repeaters and dropouts; and (iii) strengthening \nmanagement capacity, policy development, and planning. Results will include a feasibility study \nof investments suitable for ADB financing based on the recommendations of the ESTMP and \ngovernment priorities. The TA will also explore the possibilities for cofinancing with relevant \ndevelopment partners. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will be conducted in two phases over 4 months in early 2005. Phase 1 will \ninclude  the  review  of  outcomes  of  the  National  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  and \nKakeega II, together with other Government strategy and priorities, findings of the education \nsector study, relevant donor-funded technical reports, and recommendations from the ETSMP. \nIt will include surveys in the outer islands to identify quality and efficiency issues, causes of \ninefficiencies, and community needs and demand. In phase 2, the TA will design a detailed, \ncost-effective project for consideration by the Government and ADB. Consultants will prepare a \npolicy matrix based on the ETSMP, detailing policies and strategies that may be implemented in \nconjunction with the proposed Project, including provision of an adequate recurrent budget for \nprimary, secondary, and teacher education. The TA will be implemented through discussions \nwith stakeholders and the education steering committee (ESC) as part of a broad consultative \nprocess.  The  TA  will  facilitate  workshops  and  focus  group  meetings  to  solicit  advice  and \nrecommendations  from  stakeholders,  including  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Sports,  civil \nsociety, nongovernment organizations, churches, mission and private schools, external funding \nagencies, school management committees, the ESC, and beneficiaries. The TA will recommend \nways to ensure the relevance of educational and training programs to meet the country\u2019s needs, \nand will include a participatory project design workshop to seek stakeholder inputs. Consultants \nfor the TA will prepare a detailed project design, covering the rationale, objectives, project \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003.

The need for an additional ADB TA to improve the quality of primary and \nsecondary education in the most disadvantaged rural areas will also be examined.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$370,000 equivalent, including a foreign \nexchange cost of US$242,000 and local currency cost of US$128,000 equivalent (Appendix 3). \nADB  will  finance  US$300,000  equivalent  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and \nUS$58,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will contribute \nUS$70,000 equivalent of local currency costs\u2014mainly through contributions in kind\u2014for office \naccommodation,  counterpart  staff,  administrative  and  logistics  support,  and  other  related \nservices. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinancing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The  Ministry  of  Education  and  Sports,  the  Executing  Agency,  will  provide  overall \nguidance and liaison with the Ministry of Finance. DOE will be the Implementing Agency. The \nESC, chaired by the Minister of the Ministry of Education and Sports, will provide overall \nguidance. ADB will engage 9 person-months of international consulting and 7 person-months of \ndomestic consulting. Detailed terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. The services \nof consultants will be engaged through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection procedure \nand  a  simplified  technical  proposal  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The Government will provide at least \none full-time counterpart to help the consultants liaise with other concerned agencies and to \nobtain data as required. The consultants will provide their own equipment and use Government-\nprovided office space to carry out their work. DOE will assist with reservations on local vessels \nand will facilitate visits to outer atolls as required. \n \n17.  The TA will run for 4 months from March to June 2005. It will include an inception \nworkshop in the first month to confirm approaches and methodologies, to discuss issues to be \naddressed, and to ensure close coordination among stakeholders. ADB will be provided with \nelectronic files of the discussions and working papers, including a brief report on agreements \nreached. The TA team will prepare: (i) a midterm report, and disseminate the findings in a \nworkshop with the stakeholders after 8 weeks; (ii) a draft report in conjunction with the feasibility \nstudy for the loan project, and circulate it to the ESC and ADB for review and comments; (iii) a \nrevised draft report with comments incorporated to be circulated to a wider audience before a \nparticipatory workshop is held to finalize project design after week 13; and (iv) a final report by \nthe end of week 16. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of US$300,000 on a grant basis \nto the Government of Tuvalu for preparing the Education Sector Reform and Development \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?     national priority in country poverty   \n      No  partnership agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Tuvalu: \n \nTuvalu does not have abject poverty, but pockets of poverty and poverty of opportunity exist, including lack \nof education and access to health services, and lack of economic assets and employment opportunities. \nVulnerability is another major factor contributing to poverty. While the gross enrollment rate is about 100% \nat the primary level, participation and completion rates are low. Most people lack access to quality primary \nand secondary education, which results in high repetition and dropout rates that in turn make the system \nvery inefficient. Even students who complete the full cycle of primary and secondary education often lack \nthe skills required by the economy or for self-employment. Thus, dropouts and out-of-school youth \ncontinuously add to the ranks of the vulnerable and unemployed.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  Education  for  All,  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  and \ncommensurate policies to increase equitable access to education for all up to age 14 resulted in universal \nprimary education. Enrollment rates in Tuvalu are very impressive compared with those in other Pacific \ncountries. Still, the gains have not been equally shared. Poor students drop out without acquiring useful \nskills. The Project will address the gaps in the education sector by renewing the primary curriculum, by \nproviding  textbooks  for  secondary  students,  by  strengthening  pre-  and  in-service  teacher  training \nprograms, and by improving the examination and assessment system. The Project will address factors that \ncontribute to dropouts and to inefficiency. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n     \nWhat type of targeted intervention is needed?  \n \nWhile access to primary education is not an issue, the retention, quality, and relevance of education are \nmajor issues. Improved quality of education and efficiency will be ensured by the proposed Project. The \nproject intervention will ensure the learning outcomes of basic education. \n \nThe gender gap is insignificant; however, enrollment rates are inconsistent and further investigation will \ndetermine if gender disparities exist. Disparity is pronounced at grades 7 and 8. Poverty of opportunity and \nsocial analyses by gender and region are needed to identify major difficulties and issues faced by primary \nand secondary school students, by children with special needs, and by the rural poor. Based on the \nanalysis, a strategy will be devised to address the issues and to guide project implementation. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                  No \n \nThe participation of stakeholders during project design is essential.
