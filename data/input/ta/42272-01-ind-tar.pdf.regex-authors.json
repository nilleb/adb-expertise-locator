INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been assisting the Government of India in \nmainstreaming public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) to bridge the country\u2019s large infrastructure \ngap. This ongoing government-ADB initiative comprises a series of ADB technical assistance \n(TA) projects designed to mainstream PPP through capacity building, developing PPP project \npipelines, and creating a supportive policy environment.1 The government-ADB initiative covers \n23 PPP cells in selected states and line ministries,2 and is guided and coordinated by the central \nPPP cell at the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance.3  \n \n2.  The government requested that ADB provide continued capacity building support for \nmainstreaming PPPs during the ADB India country programming mission in September 2009. \nThe TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference were agreed between ADB and the government during May 2010.4 The \nproposed TA is in line with (i) India's Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012), (ii) ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020 for deepening private sector development,5 (iii) ADB's country operations business plan \n2010,6 (iv) the abridged version of the India country partnership strategy (2009\u20132012),7 and (v) \ninnovation and efficiency initiative.8 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Reliable and high-quality infrastructure is critical for raising productivity that supports \nsustained economic growth and poverty reduction. India\u2019s insufficient infrastructure capacity \nresults in lower productivity, higher transport and logistics costs, and reduces competitiveness. \nAccordingly, the government\u2019s goal is to increase infrastructure investment from 4.5% to 9.0% \nof gross domestic product (GDP) during the 11th plan period (2007\u20132012), in order to contribute \nto raising the GDP growth rate from 7.0% to the target of 9.0%. This equals an investment of \nnearly $800 billion during 2007\u20132012.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The Government of India\u2013ADB initiative comprises: (i) capacity building: ADB. 2006.

Total assistance under government-ADB Initiative in India amounts to $12.3 million. \n2  The ministries are Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, \nMinistry of Labour and Employment, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Rural Development, and \nMinistry of Shipping. The states comprise Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal \nPradesh,  Gujarat,  Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Orissa,  Punjab,  Rajasthan,  Tamil  Nadu,  and \nUttarakhand. \n3  Comprehensive data on PPPs is available at www.pppinindia.com. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 June 2010. \n5 ADB. 2008.

New \ninstruments and modalities include multitranche financing facility, subsovereign and nonsovereign public sector \nfinancing facility, local currency lending for the public sector, refinancing and restructuring modality, financing \nsyndications, and risk-sharing arrangements. \n ", "2   \n4.  An investment of this scale cannot be made solely through public financing, given the \nlimitations imposed by existing fiscal constraints. Accordingly, the government\u2019s infrastructure \ndevelopment  strategy  includes  a  core  focus  on  private  sector  participation9 and  PPPs. \nInfrastructure development is being fostered by initiatives to create an enabling environment for \nPPP  by  (i)  addressing  policy  and  regulatory  gaps  in  several  infrastructure  subsectors,  (ii) \nenhancing the capacity of public institutions and officials to manage PPP processes, and (iii) \nincreasing the volume of financing and availability of risk mitigation instruments to manage and \nallocate risks.  The government's framework and measures for mainstreaming PPPs draw on \ninternational experience, with appropriate adaptations, and include:  \n(i)  a PPP cell at DEA to coordinate mainstreaming of PPPs nationwide; \n(ii)  PPP cells in states and ministries to identify and develop PPP opportunities; \n(iii)  India  Infrastructure  Project  Development  Fund  (IIPDF),  to  finance  project \npreparation;  \n(iv)  India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited, to facilitate access to long-term \nfunds for infrastructure development; and  \n(v)  a  viability  gap  fund  (VGF)  to  assist  PPP  projects  in  achieving  commercial \nbankability.10  \n \n5.  Government of India-ADB public\u2013private partnership initiative. ADB is providing \ncomprehensive and structured support for mainstreaming PPPs through the 23 PPP cells. The \nthree ongoing capacity building TA projects (footnote 1[i]) support the development of basic \nlocalized standardized processes, enabling policies, facilities and resources (advisory panels),11 \nproject concepts and proposals, and provide focused on-the-job training for government officials \non the use of these procedures. The training is designed to develop skills to (i) conceptualize, \nevaluate, design, structure, procure, and implement PPP projects; and (ii) institutionalize PPP \nprocesses  through  the  creation  of  management  information  systems  (MIS),  standardized \nprocesses, and sector-specific toolkits. To complement capacity building, support for project \ndevelopment (footnote 1[ii]) is provided for select PPP projects in partnership with IIPDF. Finally, \npolicy development support (footnote 1[iii]) from ADB facilitates refinement of PPP definition, \ndevelopment of a PPP policy and regulatory framework, and expansion of PPPs in new areas, \nsuch as the rural sector.  \n \n6.  Progress of ongoing PPP TAs. All PPP cell achievements through May 2010  include \n(i) completion of 61 PPP training and knowledge-building workshops with 3,130 government \nofficials participating;12 (ii) creation of standardized PPP handbooks, process manuals, and \nstate-level PPP policy documents; (iii) creation of sector specific toolkits; and (iv) development \nof state PPP websites and databases. The contributions of the PPP cells include (i) appraisal of \n275 projects for approvals by central authorities as well as for eligibility under IIPDF and VGF \nschemes, and (ii) assistance in structuring pilot projects (footnote 1[ii]) in challenging sectors,13 \nwith over 25 projects already at various structuring and bidding stages. The improved capacity \nand  widespread  dissemination  of  the  potential  of  PPPs  has  facilitated  identification  of  a \n                                                 \n9  However, against an estimated $145 billion expected infrastructure investment from the private sector, the share of \nprivate sector investment in infrastructure has been less than 1% of GDP or about $9 billion on average per annum \n(2002\u20132007). \n10 The viability gap fund provides catalytic grant assistance of up to 20% of the capital costs; as a result of this \nfunding several projects are expected to become bankable and mobilize private sector investment. This support is \nespecially important for regions and sectors where private sector participation is not readily forthcoming.  \n11 This includes a panel of legal advisors accessible to PPP cells for due diligence of PPP projects.  \n12 This also includes PPP-X-Change, a knowledge-sharing platform launched in January 2010 at Mumbai.   \n13 The challenging sectors are those in which cost recovery has been difficult, such as water and sanitation, solid \nwaste management, urban transport, health and education, and rural infrastructure.  \n ", "  3\ncontinuous stream of bankable PPP projects across all sectors. The 16 states have identified \n900 potential PPP projects with an estimated project cost of $108 billion.14  \n \n7.  Complementing the government-ADB initiative, ADB\u2019s ongoing support ($1.20 billion)15 \nto India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited is financing 43 PPP projects with an aggregate \nproject cost of $15.76 billion; this has catalyzed an investment of $14.56 billion.16  \n \n8.  Lessons learned. What has worked well from the ongoing TAs (footnote 1[i]) has been \nthe successful provision of capacity development and training support to develop public sector \nPPP  capacities  and  institutionalization  of  PPP  skills.  The  support  provided  for  project \ndevelopment across a range of sectors and geographies has been seen as especially valuable \nand catalytic in building the PPP projects pipeline, many of which projects have been awarded \nto the private sector and are creating a momentum within the sector. Such an effort needs to be \ncontinued.  \n \n9.  What  is  emerging  as  an  area  requiring  more  focus  is  the  necessity  to  create  a \nsustainable institutional set-up within local governments to carry forward localized PPP activities \npost  ADB  support.    Within  this  is  the  need  for  well-organized  monitoring  and  information \nsystems operating on a dynamic basis to provide real time data of PPP projects.  The need also \nfor key senior level \u201cchampions\u201d to support the PPP cells and for a team of government officials \nto have a sustained presence in a PPP cell for at least 2\u22123 years are also key emerging lessons.  \nFuture ADB support needs to build upon these.  \n \n10.  Outstanding  challenges.  Capacity  building  has  been  the  bedrock  on  which  PPP \ninitiatives have grown in India. Notwithstanding the achievements, compared to the magnitude \nof the infrastructure development needs of the country, capacity building under the ongoing TAs \n(footnote 1[i]) is limited in terms of number of persons being trained. Further, the level of PPP \ninstitutionalization remains uneven, because states are at different stages of the PPP learning \ncurve. Some states will soon be able to sustain their capacity without further ADB support, while \nothers  need  basic  training  on  core  competencies.  Additional  PPP-related  capacity-building \nneeds have emerged, for management of the project life cycle, and with respect to issues such \nas termination, exit, and arbitration. Most importantly, after developing these capacities, the \ngovernment must also be able to sustain them on its own. \n \n11.  Government's  request.  Because  of  the  high  priority  in  utilizing  PPP  to  support \ninfrastructure development in India, long-term capacity building of the relevant public sector \nofficials is required.17 Despite the successes and significant impacts realized to date (para. 6), \nmany sectors, line ministries, and states are at the early stages of introducing PPPs and need to \nprovide continued training on core competencies to an increased number of officials. Hence, the \ngovernment requested additional support. States and ministries that are more advanced in \nmainstreaming PPPs will need to deepen their training in project development by following \n                                                 \n14 The 201 projects include 6 industrial infrastructure projects ($14.5 billion), 50 in the road sector ($4.3 billion), 91 in \nurban infrastructure ($2.5 billion), and 2 in metro rail ($2.3 billion); the remainder are in sectors such as health, \ninformation  technology,  power,  ports,  tourism,  water,  and  others.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to India for the India Infrastructure Project Financing Facility. Manila (Loan 2404-IND, approved \non 20 December, for $500 million); and ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors: Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to India for the Second India Infrastructure Project Financing \nFacility. Manila (Loan 2586-IND, approved 27 November, for $700 million). \n16 All 43 PPP projects have achieved financial closure and are being implemented.  \n17 The need for deepening capacity building is also brought out by the midterm review of PPP mainstreaming efforts.  \n ", "4   \nthrough on the design and development of identified PPP projects. Some states and central line \nministries also need to expand their capacity building to district and subdistrict levels. Hence, \nthe government has a clear exit strategy. For maturing PPP cells, the government is committed \nto ensuring that states and line ministries will create their own PPP departments to replace the \nexisting ADB PPP cells upon the conclusion of the TA projects, in order to provide continuity \nand ensure sustainability of the ongoing PPP mainstreaming process.  \n \n12.  The rapid acceptance of PPPs in India has resulted in policy and institutional challenges. \nSectors are increasingly being opened for private and foreign investment. User charges are \nbeing promoted, and regulatory institutions are being strengthened to create an enabling PPP \nenvironment. It is critical that states and line ministries adapt to these changes if investment \nopportunities are to be maximized; it is also important that the TA (i) strengthen learning \nbetween states and ministries; and (ii) ensure that lessons from completed and ongoing PPP \nprojects  continue  to  complement  standard  capacity-building  elements  (i.e.,  PPP  rationale, \ntransaction  structures,  financing  modalities,  and  management  of  risks).  A  separate  cross-\nregional  training  program  (budgeted  for  $20,000)  on  PPP  will  be  implemented  to  provide \nofficials from other South Asian countries the opportunity to learn from the experiences of this \nTA in India.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA is improved access to basic infrastructure services and increased \nefficiency in infrastructure service provision. The outcome of the TA is improved public sector \ncapacity to develop, implement, and monitor infrastructure PPP projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The  TA  will  extend  ongoing  ADB  capacity-building  support  (footnote  1[i])  for \nmainstreaming PPPs in India for 24 months (from January 2011 to December 2012). The TA will \nhave three components: (i) addressing the capacity needs of states and central line ministries \nthat are at the early stages of PPP development, (ii) assisting the second-generation (Refer to \nparagraph 14 below) capacity needs of states and line ministries with relatively advanced PPP \nframeworks,18 and (iii) making PPP mainstreaming efforts sustainable.19 This will be achieved \nthrough support to a maximum of 16 PPP cells, including the PPP cell at DEA, Ministry of \nFinance. PPP cells will be selected in consultation with the government.  \n \n15.  For less advanced or recently added PPP cells, activities will include capacity building \non  core  competencies  including  (i)  understanding  PPP  project  structuring,  appraisal,  and \nevaluation; (ii) developing concepts for pilot PPP projects; and (iii) developing and implementing \nMIS, standardized process, manuals, sector toolkits, and policy guidelines. The TA will also \ndisseminate knowledge and international best practices.  \n \n                                                 \n18 The states  with relatively advanced PPP cells are  Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, \nMaharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand; line ministries with relatively advanced PPP cells are \nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Rural Development, and Ministry of Shipping.  \n19 The government is developing a national training program on PPPs in 20 states through state training institutions; \nonline tool kits for roads, ports, urban waste, sanitation, and transport; and a communications strategy on PPPs \ndirected at elected officials.  \n ", "  5\n16.  For more advanced PPP cells, the TA will provide capacity building on the next phase of \nPPP activities relating to (i) deepening capacity building at district and subdistrict levels; (ii) \ndeveloping pilot PPP projects leading to financial closure; (iii) developing more sophisticated \n(and online) toolkits for financial and PPP modeling in relevant sectors; (iv) developing PPP \nprojects in challenging sectors (water supply, urban transport, health, and education); and (v) \nmanaging project life cycle issues (such as arbitration), and other issues (such as termination \nand exit). The TA team will work with PPP cells, under the guidance of DEA, to develop \nadvanced PPP project performance and monitoring metrics to better inform government bodies \non  budget  needs,  VGF/subsidy  requirements,  tariff  policy  and  revenue  models,  contingent \nliability  exposure,  and  areas  of  needed  policy  and  regulatory  enhancements  to  improve \ngovernment oversight, implementation and management of PPPs.  The PPP cell at DEA will \nprovide centralized capacity building and support, such as appraisal of central government \nprojects and support for VGF and IIPDF.  \n \n17.  To ensure the long-term sustainability of the ADB assistance, the TA will help strengthen \ngovernment institutional structures through policy dialogue on sector and institutional reforms. \nThe TA will also introduce (i) advanced training programs for officials through state training \ninstitutes, and (ii) a PPP certification program to safeguard the quality of the capacity building. \nThe government is committed to establishing at least 23 PPP units in the target states and \ncentral line ministries to replace the PPP cells upon TA closure. The government will also \nprovide  an  adequate  budget  to  adequately  staff  the  established  PPP  units  with  trained \ngovernment  officials,  while  integrating  their  work  into  the  respective  state  and  central  line \nministry infrastructure development plan.20 A relevant human resource strategy will also be \ndiscussed and implemented with the respective government entities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $3.75 million equivalent, of which $1.0 million will \nbe  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-Other \nSources) and $2.0 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  government  will  provide  $750,000 \nequivalent  to  finance  local  currency  costs  to  cover  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities, \nadministrative support, facilitation for meetings, and other expenses. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  DEA will be the executing agency. TA implementation will be based on experience and \nlessons from ongoing TA projects. DEA will oversee the implementation of the TA. The existing \nsteering committee established by DEA, chaired by a joint secretary at DEA, will continue to \nprovide  overall  guidance  and  monitor  TA  progress.  The  steering  committee  will  include \nrepresentatives from the participating PPP cells, and will meet every 6 months. Private sector \nparticipation in the steering committee is encouraged. \n  \n20.  A total of 16 PPP experts (384 person-months) and seven MIS experts (168 person-\nmonths) will be recruited on a continuous basis for 24 months to provide technical support to a \nmaximum of 16 PPP cells.21 At least one PPP expert will support each PPP cell, while the seven \n                                                 \n20 The memorandum of understanding between the states and the DEA for participation in the ongoing TA projects \nrequire the states to commit to institutionalization of capacities and procedures within the identified government \ndepartments and the PPP cell, and to enacting PPP-enabling policies and practices.  \n21 Existing consultant contracts are expected to be extended to ensure continuity, subject to satisfactory evaluations. \n ", "6   \nMIS experts will be shared among the selected PPP cells.22 In light of the extensive consultant \ninputs, a project administration consultant (24 person-months) based in INRM will also be \nrecruited. The ADB Focal Point in INRM will support implementation of the TA, working closely \nwith the DEA- PPP Cell \n \n21.  Consultants will be recruited on an individual basis for a total of 576 person-months. \nSelection  of  the  individuals  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Certification of work accomplished by the consultants will follow a dual reporting \nfrom (i) state PPP nodal officers and (ii) DEA PPP Cell/ADB PPP focal point for India. \n \n22.  The Government of India and participating state governments will provide office space, \nfurniture, and logistical and administrative support necessary to implement the project. TA \nimplementation will cover 24 months, from January 2011 to December 2012. The steering \ncommittee  will  monitor  the  MIS  experts  to  disseminate  all  available  outputs  and  outcome \nevaluations on respective government entity websites or the centralized DEA PPP website \n(http://www.pppinindia.com). The DEA- PPP Cell will provide progress report on the TA and the \nongoing PPP TAs (footnote 1) at 6 month intervals beginning in June 2011. A third party mid-\nterm assessment of the TA will be undertaken following on the first year of implementation to \nfocus on assuring that training under the TA program is able to be operationalized within PPP \ncells in a manner that assures robust commercial, financial, economic and policy imperatives \ndeliver sustainable transactions and therefore sustainable infrastructure and public services.  TA \nevaluation results will be made publicly available on the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n23.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of India for \nDeepening Capacity Building for Mainstreaming Public\u2013Private Partnerships, to be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction.  If  the  Board  approves  ADB \nadministering the technical assistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by \nthe Board, will approve ADB providing the balance of the technical assistance not exceeding the \nequivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the  Government  of  India  for  Deepening  Capacity  Building  for \nMainstreaming Public\u2013Private Partnerships.  \n \n                                                 \n22 A typical PPP cell consists of one PPP expert.
