INTRODUCTION \n1.  Urban infrastructure constraints have become a bottleneck for India's rapid economic \ngrowth  rate.  When  urbanizing  is  occurring  rapidly  without  proper  infrastructure,  the  urban \nenvironment rapidly deteriorates, risking the health of inhabitants. Most urban local bodies \n(ULBs) depend on intergovernmental fiscal transfers for their existence. This condition is not \nencouraging, as India has to accelerate urban infrastructure development on a sustainable and \nlarger  scale.  Lack  of  periodic  revision  of  municipal  tax  rates  and  user  charges,  and  poor \ninformation systems and records management are some of the basic weaknesses in the present \nmunicipal  administration.  India's  local  governments  are  plagued  by  low  municipal  revenue \ncompared with other emerging economies. This leads to the questions as to what afflicts the \nfinances of municipalities in India, what options exist for strengthening their finances, and what \nthe experiences are in other countries that can provide insights for local finance in India.  \n \n1\n2.   The midterm appraisal of the 10th Five-Year Plan  highlighted public finance issues \nrequiring urgent attention, including extremely low revenues, poor service delivery, high level of \ndeficit, and the need to upgrade infrastructure facilities. These issues continue to be included in \nthe 11th Five-Year Plan (FY2007\u2013FY2011). Closely aligned with the priorities of the 11th Five-\nYear Plan, the draft country partnership strategy (2009\u20132012) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) emphasizes (i) supporting infrastructure development, (ii) catalyzing investment through \npublic\u2013private  partnership  or  nonsovereign  operations,  and  (iii)  overall  improvement  of \ndevelopment effectiveness. ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)2 \nalso indicates the urban sector as one of the key outcome areas for development effectiveness. \nBuilding the strength of urban local financing is a crucial factor for enhancing the effectiveness \nof infrastructure-led operations and outputs toward the Strategy 2020 results framework. The \nproposed technical assistance (TA) is closely linked to the Strategy 2020. \n  \n3.   The Government of India has requested a TA from ADB for addressing the issues of \nmunicipal finance of Indian cities and municipalities to enhance their capacities in providing \nurban infrastructure and services. The TA3 is classified as category A. A fact-finding mission \nwas carried out intermittently during 8\u201321 July 2009 to formulate the proposed TA. The mission \nmet and consulted with government officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), municipal \nfinance experts, academics, and knowledge partners for the TA. Discussing further details of the \nTA,  the  mission  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  purpose,  output, \nmethodology,  key  activities,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.   The country is rapidly urbanizing (2.4% annual rate of increase in urban population while \npopulation grows at a rate of 1.5%) and at least 100 million people more are expected to be \nadded to urban areas for the next decade. The estimates by the Government of India shows4 \nthat nearly $475 billion will be required for funding the required infrastructure development \n                                                 \n1  The 10th Five-Year Plan covers FY2002\u2013FY2006. The essence of the plan is to change the role and improve the \neffectiveness of government, improve governance, reduce poverty, increase the economic growth rate, and improve \nthe productive base and infrastructure. The increased growth rate required fiscal adjustment at both the central and \nstate levels, as well as reform of the financial system.   \n2  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategy of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 July 2009. \n4  ADB. 2007. India: Country Operations Business Plan (2008\u20132010). Manila. The Government's estimation was for the \ntotal infrastructure investment needs, including urban sector. \n ", "2   \nprograms just for the next 5 years. Given the large resource requirement for infrastructure \ninvestment,  the  Government  will  have  to  rely  on  the  public\u2013private  partnership  model  for \nfinancing and operating infrastructure facilities. \n \n5.   Municipalities of India are largely classified into three groups: (i) larger urban areas \n(populations of more than 1 million) governed by municipal corporations; (ii) medium-sized \nurban areas (population size of 200,000 but less than 1 million) governed by municipal councils; \nand (iii) smaller urban areas in transition from rural to urban areas (population size less than \n200,000) governed by town councils. These categories are based on the types of governance \norganization permitted by laws and regulations. Municipal corporations usually exercise a good \ndegree of fiscal autonomy and powers as they have a larger population and tax base, and deal \nwith state governments directly. Municipalities with smaller jurisdictions have to deal with the \nstate  governments  through  the  district  collectors.5 As  the  revenue  collection  and  sharing \nprocedure differs by state government, exploring these intergovernmental fiscal relationships, \nprocedures, and mechanisms may provide important insights into the limited access of ULBs to \nresources \n \n6.   Indian  ULBs  are  third  tier  administrative  divisions,  responsible  for  providing  basic \ninfrastructure and services in cities and towns. In 2001, there were 5,161 cities and towns in the \ncountry. Under the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992, an initiative was launched to \ndecentralize power and strengthen democracy at the local level. It provided ULBs with political, \nfunctional,  and  fiscal  empowerment  for  good  governance.  Yet,  more  often  than  not,  it  is \nobserved that current local government bodies\u2014particularly small and medium-sized ULBs\u2014\nhave poor fiscal competencies and capacities to exercise devolved power. Mobilizing domestic \nresources or debt financing for urban infrastructure investments is difficult because, invariably, \nULBs have very low credit ratings (if they can be considered for creditworthiness) due to fiscal \nweaknesses. The fiscal strength and sustainability of ULBs are at the core of financing the \nprovision of sustainable urban infrastructure. It is important to review and analyze in-depth \nwhether  fiscal  decentralization  has  been  adequately  placed  to  pursue  effective  urban \ndevelopment at the ULB level. \n \n7.   Meanwhile,  state  governments  have  made  municipal  laws  grounded  on  the  74th \nConstitutional Amendment Act of 1992, and each state has varying degrees of conformity with \nthe legislation in terms of what are obligatory or discretionary functions of municipal bodies \nwithin each state. These differences tend to create certain deviations from the principles of \nefficient  allocation  of  resources  across  different  levels  of  the  governmental  administration \nfunctions; i.e., under the theory of fiscal federalism, certain roles and functions are better placed \nin the lower tiers of government while some can be more efficiently delivered by higher levels of \ngovernment. Thus, it is equally important to study whether (i) service provision and revenue \ngeneration and collection remain within the same jurisdiction, and (ii) efficient resources are \nallocated according to the economic principles of municipal financing. \n \n8.   Justification for the proposed TA stems from the fact that previous studies that have \nbeen  conducted  on  this  topic  have  been  routine,  comprising  at  most  a  bare  analysis  of \nmunicipal revenue and expenditure, with little insight into the underlying causes of stagnation in \nthe finances of municipalities. Currently, no municipal fiscal policy exists in India. Due to the \nabsence of a basic reference document, efforts to build capacities in the sphere of municipal \nfinance have been ad hoc and perfunctory. ADB's assistance on public financing during the late \n1980s  and  1990s  contributed  to  a  major  change  in  federal  fiscal  relations  with  regard  to \n                                                 \n5  District collectors (or magistrates) handle law and order, revenue collection, taxation, control of planning permission, \nand response to emergencies. \n ", "    3\nintroducing state value-added tax (VAT). Recently, all the state governments have adopted VAT \nand there is a proposal to move towards a goods and services tax starting in April 2010. Some \nULBs have taken steps to reform property tax issues.6 These initiatives have a multiplier effect \nin the improvement of taxes. However, issues of India's municipal financing have hardly been \naddressed  in  a  holistic  manner;  they  have  been  addressed  in  a  fragmented  way  as  the \nmunicipal capacity building component of urban infrastructure projects. A vast knowledge gap \nneeds to be bridged.  \n \n9.   Advanced decentralized Asian economies may provide insights into possible directions \nfor further reforms in this sphere. Thus, promoting a partnership would be useful in filling the \nknowledge gap. A Wall Street Journal article7 summarized a recent study funded by the World \nBank, The Growth Report: Strategies for Sustained Growth and Inclusive Development, wherein \nonly  six  fast-growth  countries  were  recognized  as  truly  having  become  high-income \nindustrialized  economies:  those  are  the  four  East  Asian  Tigers\u2014Hong  Kong,  China;  the \nRepublic  of  Korea;  Singapore;  and  Taipei,China.  Among  these  emerging  economies,8 the \nRepublic of Korea is the only one that has a research institution dedicated to public finance (it is \nin conjunction with the Ministry of Strategy and Finance of the Republic of Korea). Knowledge \npartnership between such institutions in the Republic of Korea and in India would be conducive \nto networking and cross-learning. \n \n10.   A number of important initiatives have been taken in India to strengthen the finances of \nmunicipalities and to simultaneously identify areas needing attention: (i) the Jawaharlal Nehru \nNational Urban Renewal Mission was launched, with one of the key aims being the fiscal \nempowerment of municipalities; (ii) the Reserve Bank of India has constituted a working group \ncomprising the state finance secretaries and a few experts to consider additional reforms; and \n(iii) a high-powered expert committee9 was constituted to review the physical and financial \nnorms of urban infrastructure services, and to suggest a model for financing such services. To \nsupport various initiatives by the Government of India in enhancing local public financing, the TA \naims to review and analyze municipal financing in a holistic manner.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The long-term goal of this TA is to assist the Government in formulating a feasible \ndirection for the fiscal reform program by assessing the fiscal decentralization and budget and \nrevenue systems at the municipal level. The expected impact is improved fiscal and financial \nperformance  of  ULBs,  which  can  be  monitored  through  the  increased  share  of  municipal \nexpenditure as a percentage of total gross domestic product, combined with the increased ratio \nof own resources to municipal expenditure. \n \n12.  The immediate purposes of this proposal are to provide a holistic view of the issues of \nthe municipal finance structure and/or system, and to identify key reform measures of municipal \n                                                 \n6  An example of that is the Bangalore Municipal Corporation. In Gujarat, octroi has been abolished, and the state \ngovernment now permits an additional 1% levy on the VAT to compensate the urban local bodies for the loss \nresulting from octroi abolition. \n7  Wall Street Journal. 2008. How Nations Become Rich. 22 May. \n8  Hong Kong, China and Singapore are city-states, and these two city-state countries have a governance structure \nthat is relatively more simple than the others. \n9  On 14 May 2008, the Government of India constituted a high-level policy advisory group called the High-Powered \nExpert Committee on Urban Infrastructure. It is also expected to review the experiences of \"emerging market\" \ncountries to identify innovative ideas and solutions for the massive urban infrastructure challenges facing India.  \n     ", "4   \nfinance in India's rapidly changing urban context. The expected outcomes of the proposed study \nare key reform measures and options that enable municipalities to function more effectively in \nthe provision of urban infrastructure. Recommendations on short- and long-term institutional \nreform agendas and capacity development areas, together with a road map, can support some \nreform measures that would follow after the TA.. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  In general, a study on municipal financing can be very broad, and requires extensive \ntime and effort. Given the scale of challenges in India and the limited resources available under \nthe TA, it is important to limit the scope of the TA to the most important issues. The study will \nfocus on representative samples of 30 municipalities in 4\u20136 selected states with different levels \nof economic development and differing geography. Prevailing municipal acts will be considered \nwhen selecting sample ULBs. An eminent international expert on public finance will be engaged \nto guide the focus of the study. The TA will establish a knowledge-sharing platform with a \nprominent public finance research institution in the Republic of Korea, through which the Indian \nstudy team can access a broader knowledge-base of practices in Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development countries. Further, resource persons will be invited at critical \ntimes to discuss policy measures and reform options, and join one of the national or subregional \nforums or international workshops. The expected outputs of the study and activities are as \nfollows:  \n \n(i)  Component 1: Review overall issues and assess the sustainability of municipal \nfinance in India, accompanied by recommendations for municipal fiscal policy \nand reform agendas. \n(ii)  Component  2:  Broaden  the  knowledge  base  regarding  the  municipal \ngovernments' fiscal and financial system through international good practices and \nknowledge partnership.  \n(iii)  Component 3: Increase awareness and build consensus in the political arena on \nthe need for municipal finance reform. \n \n14.  The study will be implemented over 18 months starting on 1 September 2009 and \nending by 28 February 2011. The TA will conduct the following activities: (i) literature survey; (ii) \na macro analysis of municipal finances in India; (iii) detailed analysis in 4\u20136 states; (iv) case \nstudies from three Asian countries and one developed country; (v) one international workshop, \none national forum, one subregional forum, and a series of small local consultation meetings; \nand (vi) reports and publications. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of delivering the outputs of the proposed TA is $670,000. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis, in an amount equivalent to $500,000, by the Republic of Korea e-Asia \nand Knowledge Partnership Fund, and will be administered by ADB. The Government of India \nwill finance office space, miscellaneous administrative support, remuneration of government \nofficials involved in the study, and other necessary facilities as in-kind expenses, equivalent to \n$170,000. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan for the TA are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Department of Economic Affairs of the MOF will be the executing agency for the TA. \nThe TA underscores the importance of a potential policy reform agenda for which the TA has to \nconsult closely with ministries and the Reserve Bank of India. In addition, the nature of the study \n ", "    5\nrequires a highly regarded national institution that can access various levels of local data, for \nwhich  international  consultants  will  rely  on  adequately  qualified  domestic  consultants.  The \nNational Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP)10 is such an institution; it is a center for \napplied research in public finance and public policy. As an apex institution to the MOF, the \nNIPFP's research has been influential in policy making on this subject in India. Therefore, the \nNIPFP is both strategically well-positioned and practically advantageous for the study. The TA \nwill use the single source selection method for consultant selection, on a firm basis, to get the \nmost qualified research institution in India in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \nline with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.11 \n \n17.  The TA requires 50 person-months of inputs. An additional 2 person-months input from \nan eminent international expert advisor on public finance will be required to work with the NIPFP \nat  critical  points,  such  as  formulating  the  study  direction,  devising  policy  measures,  and \nfinalizing  the  report.  The  international  expert  advisor  will  be  engaged  intermittently  on  an \nindividual basis in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB will also \nengage a maximum of three prominent global experts on public and municipal finance, in \nconsultation with the India study team, as resource persons. These experts will advise on \noverall  study,  particularly  policy  measures  and  reform  options  that  exist  globally,  by \nrecommending  effective  actions  for  development  of  a  reform  agenda  for  India's  municipal \nfinance. ADB will engage these resource persons according to its guidelines. The NIPFP will \nprovide the list of potential candidates for ADB's endorsement and recruitment. Appendix 3 \nincludes the outline terms of reference. \n \n18.  The TA will form an experts advisory group, composed of 5\u20136 experts selected from the \nmembers of the working group of the Reserve Bank of India, members of the high-powered \nexpert committee, a globally eminent international expert advisor in public finance, an expert \nfrom the Korean Institute of Public Finance, and the director of the NIPFP as well as the \nprincipal team leader of NIPFP. ADB\u2019s principal task manager will participate in key meetings \nfrom time to time, upon request by the experts advisory group. Also, a knowledge-sharing \nplatform will be arranged through a prominent public finance research institution in the Republic \nof Korea, through which the Indian study team can access broader knowledge. The Republic of \nKorea's  experience  in devolved  municipal financing  can facilitate  NIPFP  learning  practices \nrelevant to India\u2019s context. A workshop will be conducted in the Republic of Korea, which will be \nattended by an Indian delegation of a maximum of 20 persons, including the experts advisory \ngroup, senior policy makers on municipal finance, and core members of the NIPFP study team.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund for the India Municipal Finance Study, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                                 \n10 The NIPFP maintains its independence in its research activities, and raises funds for its research activities from the \ncentral and state governments, as well as from international and bilateral organizations. The main aim of the NIPFP \nis to contribute to policy making relating to public economics. The NIPFP has made important contributions to \nreforming the tax system and in designing the VAT. It is one of the three nodal agencies responsible for appraising \nthe Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission agenda. It is involved in a number of studies for the 13th \nFinance  Commission,  including  one  on  property  taxation  (http://www.saneinetwork.net/directory/Institutes/ \naspgenerator.asp?FI=MI&directory=43).  \n11  ADB. 2008.

Provide ideas on the precise nature of questions that the \nstudy needs to probe, and generate ideas on the analytical architecture of \nthe study. \n(b)  A macro analysis of municipal finances in India, focusing on (i) policy with \nregard to the finances of municipalities; (ii) typologies of their functions, \ni.e., regulatory, enforcement, service provision, etc.; and (iii) nature and \ndimension of municipal finances, i.e., tax, nontax, transfers, and grants on \nthe revenue side; and capital versus recurrent expenditure, wages and \nestablishment,  service  provision  on  the  expenditure  side.  A  macro \nanalysis may also look at the market or creditworthiness. It will be a data-\nbased component. \n(c)  Detailed work in 4\u20136 states. Guided by the expert advisory group, the \nNIPFP will develop criteria for the selection of states. It will be a detailed \nstudy  and  probe  where  the  weakness  and  strengths  of  the  current \nsystems  lie  and  look  at  the  impact  of  parastatal  agencies  on  the \nfunctioning and finances of municipalities.  \n(d)  Case studies from three Asian countries and one non-Asian developed \ncountry which is a member country of ADB. These case studies are seen \n     ", "14          Appendix 3 \nas city-specific and may focus on how  the finances of municipalities are \nattended  to\u2014such  as  administrative  procedures,  capacities,  internal \ncommunication, management and governance\u2014as well as the financial \nstrengths  and  weakness,  sources  of  revenues,  and  the  allocation  of \nrevenues  for  different  services  (i.e.,  budgeting),  among  other  things. \nClearly, the messages of such cases will be on the changes that can be \nbrought about in the Indian system. Each case study will take 6 weeks, \nand will be conducted by local national consultants.   \n \n18.  The key deliverables are as follows:  \n(i)  inception report (October 2009), \n(ii)  interim report (April 2010), \n(iii)  workshop proceedings (October 2010), \n(iv)  two national forums (June 2010, and February 2011), \n(v)  draft final report (November 2010), and \n(vi)  final report (February 2011). \n \n19.  Suggested Assessment Subtopics. The proposal aims to assess the status, issues, \nchallenges,  and  opportunities  for  improvement  in  municipal  finance  in  a  holistic  way.  It  is \nsuggested that the NIPFP considers the study framework for sustainable urban financing and \nthe  associated  reform  agenda  to  be  structured  systematically  by,  but  not  restricted  to, \naddressing the following review areas: \n(i)  Budget management to enhance fiduciary control. Municipal laws prescribe \nthe resource-raising powers and budgeting, accounting, and auditing procedures \nto be followed by ULBs. These procedures do not meet modern standards for \nfiduciary  control  and  also  differ  considerably  across  states.  Preferably,  the \nbudgetary process, accounting and auditing standards, procedures, and codes \nshould be set nationally, as in the case of the accounts of the central and state \ngovernments. Budget and financial control reforms should aim for segregation of \nrevenue and capital budgets, adoption of accrual-based accounts, cash planning \nand  budgeting,  centralized  financial  control,  development  of  core  investment \nplans  to  ensure  adequate  allocation  of  resources  for  priority  projects, \ndevelopment of a project cost system, financial forecasting models, and a reliable \nfinancial management information system. \n(ii)  Tax  and  nontax  revenue  reforms  to  strengthen  financing  resources. \nProperty tax and octroi tax reforms are an immediate imperative. The scope to \nintroduce new taxes, such as the vacant land tax, and development fees could \nbe explored. The TA could also look at the scope for assignment of taxes from \nthe state governments. Nontax revenues, which are a form of benefit taxes, are \nthe most efficient ways to raise revenues at ULBs. But reforms are difficult; \nparticularly because the existing cost recovery rates are low. The feasibility of \nvarious  options  could be  assessed,  i.e.,  a  tiered  tariff structure,  the  gradual \nincrease in tariffs by fully passing on incremental costs, constitution of regulatory \nauthorities  to  depoliticize  tariff  setting,  linking  resource  flows  from  the  state \ngovernments  to  performance  in  cost  recovery,  and  making  tariff  reforms \nmandatory  for  accessing  loans  from  domestic  and  international  financial \ninstitutions. \n ", "    Appendix 3  15\n(iii)  Fiscal sustainability and prioritizing expenditures. Assessment of financial \nresources should cover whether government expenditure is used, or whether it is \nbeing  used  for  its  intended  purposes.  Inefficiencies  regarding  spending \nallocations across sectors, weaknesses in procurement, and the accountability \nframework  are  also  identified.  What  are  the  main  drivers  of  ULBs  public \nexpenditures?  Accordingly,  some  financing  options  can  be  considered  for \nmedium-  and  longer-term  frameworks.  As  the  immediate  need  for  public \nspending in most ULBs is immense, an analysis of expenditure patterns and \ntrends precedes an option on how to determine priority expenditure across and \nwithin sectors. Often forgotten questions for fiscal sustainability assessment are: \n(a) What is the right sequencing between competing priorities?; and (b) What are \nthe most effective interventions? \n(iv)  Political,  legal,  and  institutional  matters.  A  rational  realignment  of  the \nresources and responsibilities of ULBs would be needed for them to properly \ndeliver public services mandated under the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act \nof 1992 on a sustainable basis. This requires an in-depth study and suggestions \non some feasible options for the state governments to rationalize location and \ndistribution of resources, policy making, and executive powers to enhance the \ndelivery of public services. The reform options could seek to achieve, through a \nnational consensus, a degree of uniformity in the basic framework for (a) division \nof responsibilities and resources between the state governments and ULBs, (b) \ninstitutional arrangements for setting service delivery standards and addressing \nvertical  and  horizontal  fiscal  imbalances,  and  (c)  measures  to  improve  the \npolitical accountability of ULBs as mandated under the Constitution. Typically \nthese  reforms  are  time  consuming  and  need  considerable  intergovernmental \nconsensus,  agreement,  and  coordination.  The  NIPFP  could  suggest  (a)  the \nground to be covered; (b) how to proceed; (c) sequencing of steps; and (d) a \nfeasible  timetable  in  consultation  with  the  experts  advisory  group,  the \ninternational expert advisor, and the KIPF. \n     "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090825142919+08'00'", "Subject": "Policy and Advisory Technical Assistance (PATA)", "Author": "ls6", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "india municipal finance study, korea e-Asia knowledge partnership fund, policy advisory technical assistance, korean institute public finance, adb PATA, adb technical assistance 7334, adb project 43214", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090902104602+08'00'", "Title": "India Municipal Finance Study (Financed by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund)"}, "author_page": "   \nVice-President  X.
