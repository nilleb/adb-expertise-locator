The Government of Kiribati emphasizes the need for improving the economy of the outer \nislands,  particularly  Kiritimati  (Christmas)  Island.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has \ntherefore included a technical assistance (TA) for Implementation of Population Policy and a \nLand Development Program in its country strategy and program update 2006\u20132007.1 The TA \nFact-Finding Mission visited Kiribati (Kiritimati Island and Tarawa) from 16 to 30 August 2006 \nand  discussed  with  government  officials  the  objectives  and  scope,  implementation \narrangements, and outline of general terms of reference of the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Kiribati is a remote, widely scattered Pacific nation that straddles the equator. It has the \nlargest exclusive economic zone2 (3.5 million square kilometers [km2]) of any Pacific developing \nmember country of ADB. The nation has 33 coral atolls, 23 of which are inhabited. They are \ndivided into three distinct groups of islands: the Gilbert Group, the Phoenix Group, and the Line \nGroup. Kiritimati Island, which is part of the Line Group, covers an area of 388 square km2. It \naccounts for half of Kiribati's total land area. It is located some 3,000 km east of South Tarawa \nand its population was approximately 5,000 people as of 2005. All three island groups span the \nequator, which runs through the country passing just south of Tarawa. These low-lying islands \nhave few points that are more than 2 meters above sea level, making them vulnerable to rising \nsea levels. People rely on fresh groundwater and rainfall for their water supply.  \n \nA.  Population Issues \n3.  In 1947 only 1,671 people lived in South Tarawa, but by 2005 this figure had risen to \n40,311. Movement from outer islands to South Tarawa has been especially marked since 1995, \nwith the population actually declining in most outer islands while South Tarawa's population has \nincreased  by  5.2%  per  annum.  People  move  to  South  Tarawa  to  obtain  education  and \nemployment, but schools are becoming overcrowded, and there are nowhere near as many \nwage-paying jobs as needed. Each year the population of South Tarawa grows by about 2,000 \npeople\u2014the equivalent of 67 classrooms, each with 30 students. If the current growth rate \ncontinues, the population of South Tarawa will double in less than 14 years. \n \n4.  The impact of this rapid population growth in one small area is obvious. Population \ndensities in South Tarawa have increased, and almost 12,509 people now live in Betio, a small \nislet with an area of only 1.75 km2. Many residents lack safe water and sanitation. New houses \nare needed to accommodate the growing population, but vacant land is becoming scarce. \nOvercrowding and the lack of safe water and sanitation affect health. Kiribati has high rates of \ninfectious  diseases,  including  respiratory,  diarrhea,  and  skin  diseases,  and  an  increasing \nincidence of Hepatitis B. Families that cannot grow enough food need to buy imported products \nthat are low in fiber but high in sugar and fat. This contributes to a growing incidence of \ndiabetes, cancer, and other related diseases. \n \n5.  Two thirds of all wage jobs in Kiribati are in public service; 64% of such jobs are in South \nTarawa. Only about 1 in 10 I-Kiribati (the people of Kiribati) is a wage earner. The few wage \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 1 September 2006. In ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and \nProgram Update 2006\u20132007. Manila, the land use management and population policy components are identified as \ntwo separate TA projects. At the later stage, because they had similar objectives, it was decided to process it as a \nsingle TA project.  \n2  Under the law of the sea, an exclusive economic zone is a seazone over which a state has special rights over the \nexploration and use of marine resources \n ", "2   \nearners must provide for the cash needs of many non-workers in their extended families. This is \nespecially difficult in South Tarawa, where most people who have come in search of work do not \nhave their own land and depend largely on store-bought goods.  \n \n6.  The  National  Development  Strategies  2004\u20132007:  Enhancing  Growth  and  Ensuring \nEquitable Distribution,3 identifies the following as a key development strategy: \u201cDesign and \nimplement comprehensive population policy to achieve stability of total population by 2020\u2013\n2025.\u201d There are two main ways to achieve a stable population. One is large-scale permanent \nemigration,  and  the  other  is  for  every  family  to  have  only  enough  children  to  \u201creplace\u201d \nthemselves. In the short run, voluntary resettlement from South Tarawa to Kiritimati Island is \nexpected  to  help  alleviate  the  problems  associated  with  high  population  density  in  South \nTarawa. In the long run, carefully designed population policies need to be implemented to tackle \nissues associated with high population growth. This TA is closely related to and will support the \nobjectives of the Outer Island Growth Centers Project.4 \n \nB.  Land Development Issues on Kiritimati Island \n7.  With the exception of some freehold plots in Tabwakea and Poland villages, all land on \nKiritimati Island is state owned, including land leased by the Government to various occupants, \nincluding  foreign  investors  such  as  the  Japan  Aerospace  Exploration  Agency.5  With  a \npopulation of approximately 5,000 persons as of 2005 and a population density of about 8.5 \npeople per km2, Kiritimati Island contrasts starkly with overcrowded South Tarawa. Therefore, \nthe Government is considering providing opportunities for people from overcrowded areas\u2014\nparticularly South Tarawa\u2014to resettle on Kiritimati Island. \n \n8.  The recently completed TA on Supporting Land Use Management on Kiritimati Island6 \ndeveloped a new land management system for Kiritimati Island and provided a policy and \nplanning framework through which state lands could be alienated and developed. This new land \nmanagement system was endorsed by the Cabinet in 2005. \n \n9.  A key policy direction of the new land management system on Kiritimati Island will be the \nrelease of 600 plots over the next 4 years, including the release of 300 plots during the first \nyear,7 and the development of structure plans and subsequent layout plans for Tabwakea North \nand New Banana. The plots will be released as leaseholds for 25 years, with an option of \nrenewal for second and third 25-year periods (hence, 75 years in total), subject to meeting the \nconditions of the leasehold agreement. The leased land will be allocated for (i) residential \npurposes, (ii) business purposes, (iii) investments, and (iv) community and special uses. The \nplot sizes are a quarter of an acre; the current lease payment is $1,129.50 per acre per year for \nbusiness leases, and $874.50 per acre per year for residential leases. \n \n10.  The Government needs to take further action on several land management issues so as \nto facilitate the proper implementation of the new land management system. First, outstanding \n                                                 \n3  Government of Kiribati. 2003. National Development Strategies 2004\u20132007: Enhancing Growth and Ensuring \nEquitable Distribution. Tarawa. \n4  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Kiribati for Preparing the Outer Island Growth Centers Project. \nManila (approved on 2 December).  \n5  Formerly known as National Aero Space Development Agency (NASDA). \n6  ADB 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Kiribati for Supporting Land Use Management on Kiritimati \n(Christmas) Island. Manila (approved on 16 December). This TA produced a land management system together \nwith a general land-use plan, a detailed land-use plan for priority areas, and a land valuation system, supported by \ncomputerized land database and GIS mapping systems. \n7  The first-year target of 300 plots will be allocated as follows: 150 plots for residents of Kiritimati and 150 plots for \nresidents of South Tarawa and Betio. ", "  3\ntotal  land  rent  payments  from  leaseholds  on  Kiritimati  Island  have  escalated  from  about \nA$325,000 in 2003 to more than A$600,000 in 2006. Second, squatters increased from about \n50 families in 2003 to more than 200 families in 2006. Third, restrictions on using state land as \nsecurity to obtain a mortgage under the existing legal system may cause constraints in securing \nloans to build houses and/or to do business. These key issues should be resolved so that they \ndo  not  hamper  the  overall  economic  development  of  Kiritimati  Island.8  The  Cabinet's \nendorsement of the new land management system was a very important step, as land is a \nsensitive issue in the I-Kiribati sociocultural order. The system should be used as a blueprint for \ndeveloping land for housing, business, investments (industry, tourism, etc.) and community \npurposes, so as to foster economic growth on the island. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.   The purpose of the TA is to provide policy advice and guidance in achieving sustainable \neconomic growth and social development on Kiritimati Island. The TA will support the design of \na population policy as well as the implementing of a land development program for the island. \nTherefore, the TA has two major implementation components: (i) population policy and (ii) land \ndevelopment program on Kiritimati Island. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n   \n12.  Population Policy. The strategic objective of the population policy component will be to \nstabilize population growth in order to ensure balance between population and resources, which \nwill lead to improved living standards and wellbeing for the local population. The population \npolicy component will address both sides of the balance between population and resources; i.e., \nit will support strategies to increase the value of human resources\u2014including improved health, \neducation,  living  conditions,  and  increased  employment  opportunities\u2014and  will  lead  to  a \nreduction in the population growth rate, which in turn will lead to economic growth, social \nprogress, and raised living standards. The impacts of  this component will be an established, \ncomprehensive population policy for Kiribati; an integrated strategy to tackle squatters; well-\nconceived incentives to voluntarily resettle Kiritimati Island; and improved public health. The \noutcomes will be enhanced welfare as the total population stabilizes by 2020\u20132025, fewer \nsquatters, substantial and effective voluntary resettlement to Kiritimati Island, and population \nhealth adequately considered in the economic development. \n \n13.  Land  Development  Program.  The  TA  will  support  implementation  of  the  main \ncomponents of the agreed land management system\u2014particularly the pilot activities to release \n300 plots in the first year. The TA will also prepare detailed layout plans for the proposed \nTabwakea North and New Banana townships. The expected TA impacts will be improved \noverall land use management and land development programs\u2212\u2212including an integrated land \nand infrastructure development. The outcome of this coordinated land development program on \nKiritimati  Island  will  be  settlements  and  townships  that  are  properly  planned  and  more \nenvironmentally sustainable. \n \n14.  The key outputs of the proposed TA will be in two broad categories. The population \npolicy component will have the following outputs: (i) improved population policy based on the \nresults of the 2005 population census, (ii) documentation on the voluntary resettlement plan \nfrom South Tarawa to Kiritimati Island, (iii) an integrated strategy to tackle squatters, and (iv) \n                                                 \n8  The Government has put some efforts into addressing these three major issues. Public consultation meetings were \norganized by the Ministry of Line and Phoenix Islands Development (MLPID) on 24 and 28 August 2006. These \nwere followed by wider consultations. \n ", "4   \neconomic analysis of the health facility on Kiritimati Island. The land development program will \nhave the following outputs: (i) a land development program for priority areas incorporating \nessential  infrastructure,  and  detailed  layout  plans  for  Tabwakea  North  and  New  Banana \ntownships;  (ii)  an  established  land  release  program,  improved  land  administration  system, \nimproved  computerized  data  management  system;  and  (iii)  updated  legislation  and  legal \nsystems to improve land security and land development.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  Main Component 1: Population Policy.  \n \n(i)  Subcomponent  1:  population  policy.  This  will  focus  on  designing  a \ncomprehensive population policy to achieve population stability by 2020\u20132025. \nThis process will include inter-ministerial workshops as well as village (local) \nworkshops to increase awareness of the issues and problems associated with \nhigh population density and rapid population growth. Issues related to squatters \nwill  be  also  discussed.  The  results  of  the  2005  population  census  will  be \nanalyzed and considered in the population policy subcomponent. \n(ii)  Subcomponent 2: voluntary resettlement plan. This will involve the conduct of \na rapid review of previous voluntary resettlement from South Tarawa to Kiritimati \nIsland. This TA subcomponent will also conduct a survey and a participatory \nworkshop to review the current situation with resettlement from South Tarawa to \nKiritimati  Island.  A  strategic  plan  to  facilitate  voluntary  resettlement  will  be \nprepared, including an outline of the process by which such resettlement will \noccur.  \n(iii)  Subcomponent 3: public health on Kiritimati Island. This will center on the \ncollection of information and an assessment of the public health situation on \nKiritimati Island. In addition, a proposal will be prepared on how to maintain \npublic  health  conditions  in  view  of  the  anticipated  increase  in  population  on \nKiritimati Island. \n \n16.  Main Component 2: Land Development Program.    \n \n(i)  Subcomponent  1:  land  planning  and  infrastructure  coordination.  This \nsubcomponent will focus on developing an integrated land and infrastructure \ndevelopment program for priority areas. The activity will consist of designing the \ninstitutional setup, preparing a detailed plan of the land development areas and \nthe  proposed  townships,  and  incorporating  infrastructure  development \n(particularly roads, water and sanitation, and electricity) into the plans.  \n(ii)  Subcomponent  2:  land  survey  and  administration.  This  will  involve  the \nimplementation of land development plans at the proposed development sites. \nThe activities will cover facilitating field marking of plots, a land release program \nthat  will  be  supported  by  a  range  of  land  administration  systems,  land \nregistration,  and  an  improved  land  information  system.  Overall,  this \nsubcomponent will facilitate land releases and the transfer of land to applicants, \nso as to meet the demand targets. \n(iii)  Subcomponent 3: land regulations. This subcomponent will strengthen the \nlegal basis of the land development program, including updating of the State \nLand Act, 2001; preparation of a strategic plan to formally allow the lease of state \nlands on Kiritimati Island; and review and update the State Lands Act and Land \nPlanning Ordinance where appropriate.  \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $730,000 equivalent. ADB will provide financing \nin an amount of $630,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide financing of $100,000 to \ncover office accommodation, counterpart staff in the form of a main liaison person and others as \nrequired and their transport, part of the survey costs, and office space. Detailed cost estimates \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED) will be the Executing \nAgency, and the Ministry of Environment, Lands, and Agriculture Development (MELAD) and \nMinistry of Line and Phoenix Islands Development (MLPID) will be the Implementing Agencies. \nThe Government will contribute counterpart staff, office space and administrative support on \nKiritimati Island as well as in Tarawa. Close coordination will be maintained with MFED and \nMELAD in Tarawa, as well as MLPID and the Land Management Division (LMD) on Kiritimati \nIsland. On Kiritimati Island, minimum fortnightly meetings and/or seminars will be held with the \nCommittee for Allocation of State Land, the proposed land and service coordination group, and \nthe Kiritimati Local Land Planning Board.  \n \n19.  ADB  will  recruit  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). Two consulting firms (one for the \npopulation policy component, and the other for the land development program component) will \nbe selected through the quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) method. Equipment for the TA \nwill be procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and \nwill  be  handed  over  to  the  Executing  Agency  upon  completion  of  TA.  Outline  Terms  of \nReference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.   \n \n20.  The population policy component will require 9 person-months of international consulting \nservices, consisting of (i) a demographer (team leader), (ii) resettlement and social safety \nspecialist, (iii) a health economist; and (iv) a national consultant as workshop facilitator for 2 \nperson-months.  \n \n21.  The land development program component will require 8 person-months of international \nconsulting services, consisting of (i) a land/urban development planner (Team Leader), and (ii) a \ngeographical information system (GIS) expert, and (iii) a national consultant, i.e. a computer \nsystems analyst for 2 person-months.   \n \n22.  The two TA components will be implemented over a 12-month period from April 2007 to \nMarch 2008. The team leader of each TA component will brief senior government officials in \nTarawa.  A  workshop  discussing  progress  and  issues  arising  in  TA  implementation  will  be \norganized for relevant stakeholders.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $630,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Kiribati  for  Integrated  Land  and  Population  Development  Program  on \nKiritimati Island, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nStability of total population  Formulation of population  2005 population census,  \u2022 Government\u2019s \nby 2020\u20132025, voluntary  policy to guide population  statistical data,  continued commitment \nresettlement to Kiritimati  stabilization; strategic plan  government policies,  to outer island \nIsland properly undertaken,  for voluntary resettlement  interministerial and village- development, \nand population health  prepared  level consultations and  population stabilization \nadequately factored into    workshops  and redistribution, and \neconomic development      improving people\u2019s \n      welfare \nImproved overall land use  Improvement of land  Reports on TA 4257-KIR:  \u2022 Land development \nmanagement and land  development program to  Supporting Land Use  program remains a \ndevelopment program\u2212\u2212  complement government  Management in Kiritimati  priority on Kiritimati \nincluding an integrated land  land release program  Island; Cabinet papers  Island; willingness to \nand infrastructure    related to land  adopt TA \ndevelopment  development program;  recommendations   \n  related government   \npolicies  Risk \n\u2022 Political situation \njeopardizes proposed \nactions \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEstablishment of a  Population policy that  Economic reports and  \u2022 Government \ncomprehensive population  provides adequate guidance  official statistics of the  commitment to \npolicy for Kiribati and a well- on population control  Governments, and  implement the TA \nconceived plan of voluntary  prepared; planning for  international development  outputs and \nresettlement to Kiritimati  voluntary resettlement to  agencies   recommendations \nIsland, resulting in improved  Kiritimati Island formulated;    \u2022 Continued Government \npublic health  population health program  Discussions and  support for improved \n  considered in economic  consultations with related  population policies and \n  development planning.  government agencies  land development  \n       \n    Report on TA 4257-KIR:  Risks \nCoordinated land  Land development program  Supporting Land Use  \u2022 Inadequate availability \ndevelopment program in  prepared; coordinated  Management on Kiritimati  of human and financial \nKiritimati that leads to  actions among relevant  Island  resources \nenvironmentally sustainable  agencies established to    \u2022 Weak coordination \nand properly planned  facilitate implementation of  Records from the  among agencies \ntownships and settlements   the program  ministries responsible for  responsible for \n  development coordination  integrated land \nand land use management  development program \n \nFeedback from planning \nagencies and consultation \nwith other agencies  \nOutputs       Assumptions \n\u2022 Draft population policy  Draft population policy  \u2022 Government \nbased on stakeholder  prepared  commitment to \nconsultations    implement the TA \n\u2022 Integrated strategy to  Draft strategy to tackle  outputs and \ntackle squatters  squatters  recommendations  ", "Appendix 1  7\nPerformance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n\u2022 Strategic plan of voluntary  Draft strategic plan for  \u2022 Relevant agencies \nresettlement from South  voluntary resettlement  committed to population \nTarawa to Kiritimati Island  approved   policies and land \n\u2022 Economic analysis in    development program \nhealth facility on Kiritimati  Economic analysis of health   \nIsland  facility prepared and applied  Risks \n\u2022 Land development    \u2022 Inadequate human and \nprogram incorporating  Coordinated land  financial resources \ninfrastructure needs and  development program  available \nan integrated land  established  \u2022 Relevant agencies fail \nadministration system    to coordinate integrated \n\u2022 Detailed land use plan for  Detailed land use plan for  land development \ntownships  townships approved  program \n\u2022 Improved land-related     \nState Land Act and Land \nlegislation changes to \nPlanning Ordinance \nsupport land development \namended \nprogram \n \n\u2022 Improve computerized \nCompatibility of \ndata management \ncomputerized land use \n \nmanagement database in \n \nKiritimati and Tarawa \nActivities and Milestones  Inputs \nA.
