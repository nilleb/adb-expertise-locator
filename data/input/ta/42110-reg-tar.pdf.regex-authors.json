INTRODUCTION \n1.  Water-related  disaster  management  is  a  priority  area  of  the  Water  Financing \nProgram 2006\u20132010 (WFP) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which seeks to double \ninvestments in water, with supporting reforms, capacity development, and regional cooperation. \nA targeted outcome is reduced vulnerability to floods for 100 million people in the Asia and \nPacific  region.  The  program  is  also  helping  to  introduce  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM) in 25 river basins across the region. Water-related disaster management \nis an important element of IWRM.  \n \n2.  WFP  implementation  is  backed  by  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility, which \nmobilizes cofinancing and investments from development partners. Contributions to the facility \nfinance (i) demonstration projects under the WFP in ADB\u2019s developing member countries \n(DMCs) (project support) (70%); and (ii) regional cooperation, knowledge and capacity building, \nand innovation services (program quality support) (30%). \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Water for All (2001) policy1 and Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy \n(2004)2 guide ADB investments and technical assistance (TA) both before and after disasters. \nFlood disasters accounted for more than half of ADB\u2019s disaster-related loans in 1987\u20132007. \nAbout 33% of such loans during the period went to mitigation assistance, 27% to emergency \nresponse, and 40% to rehabilitation and reconstruction.  \n \n4.  Aware  of  the  need  to  boost  investments  and  knowledge  in  water-related  disaster \nmanagement under WFP, ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development Department in 2007 \ninitiated the preparation of a regional TA project to help implement the WFP. The project, \nconceived  in  consultation  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Community  of  Practice,  would  rely  on  both \nin-country and regional assistance in water-related disaster management, and on financing from \nADB\u2019s Japan Special Fund within the framework of the Water Financing Partnership Facility. \nThe regional TA received concept clearance from ADB\u2019s Management in April 2008.3\n \n5.  Water-related disaster management is one of the three main themes of the Asia-Pacific \nWater Forum (APWF) and is supported by the International Centre for Water Hazard and Risk \nManagement  (ICHARM).  Both  organizations  were  established  in  2006\u2014APWF  by  the \nGovernment of Japan and ADB, and ICHARM by the Government of Japan and the United \nNations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO).  Flood-related  risk \nmanagement is the initial focus of ICHARM.  \n \n6.  At the inaugural Singapore International Water Week in June 2008, marking the midpoint \nof the WFP, ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda outlined a seven-point agenda prioritizing water \ninvestments in the region. Pointing out that water-related disasters are causing more loss of life \nand destruction in the region, he urged all sectors to invest more to reduce vulnerability and \n                                                 \n1  ADB\u2019s Water for All policy looks forward to helping ADB\u2019s DMCs anticipate natural calamities, and minimize \neconomic and social damage, through a better understanding of climatic patterns. The policy supports the \nintroduction of IWRM in river basins and promotes both structural and nonstructural approaches to flood protection.  \n2  ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy takes a holistic approach to disasters through measures that \nprevent  as  well  as  protect  from  such  disasters.  It  provides  for  risk  management  and  a  more  systematic \nunderstanding of disaster and its management. The aim is to (i) help DMCs manage hazards more effectively by \nreducing their exposure to risk; and (ii) facilitate rapid and adequate assistance in response to shocks. Both are \nseen as essential to mainstreaming disaster in ADB\u2019s sustainable development agenda. An important feature of the \npolicy is the development of partnerships for the systematic reduction of disaster risk. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 December 2008.  \n ", "2   \nmake communities better prepared, and more resilient. The challenge, he said, is as much \ninstitutional as it is about infrastructure building, and both need much more attention in the years \nahead. President Kuroda also reaffirmed ADB\u2019s offer to work together with clients and partners \non the WFP platform, underlining the huge dividends to be gained from working in partnership. \nWorking together to catalyze and leverage investments and pool the region\u2019s knowledge in the \npriority areas can raise the standard of living for hundreds of millions of poor people in the \nregion\u2014and increase water security for all. \n \n7.  APWF launched its KnowledgeHubs initiative during the Singapore International Water \nWeek,  to  promote  knowledge  networking  for  water  security  in  the  21st  century. 4  \nKnowledgeHubs is a network of internationally recognized institutions committed to generating \nand sharing water knowledge and capacity building in the Asia and Pacific region. Among the \n12 founding members, ICHARM serves as the regional water knowledge hub for disaster risk \nreduction and flood management. Also during Water Week, ADB and ICHARM convened a \nregional  consultation  meeting  on  water-related  disaster  management  and  climate  change \nadaptation. Senior government officials of ADB\u2019s DMCs, experts, and partner organizations at \nthe meeting endorsed the proposed TA and provided further direction to its design.  \n \n8.  ADB and ICHARM started collaborating on training workshops in water-related disaster \nmanagement for the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations (NARBO) in 2007.5 With \nICHARM\u2019s recent appointment as regional water knowledge hub for disaster risk reduction and \nflood  management  under  the  APWF  KnowledgeHubs  initiative,  ADB  expects  ICHARM  to \nprovide knowledge and capacity-building assistance in the preparation and implementation of \ndisaster risk reduction and flood management projects throughout the region. Funding from the \nproposed TA will allow wider collaboration between ADB and ICHARM in a number of interested \nDMCs,  including  Bangladesh,  India,  Indonesia,  and  with  the  Mekong  River  Commission \nSecretariat for the lower Mekong basin. \nII.  ISSUES \n9.  The past 50 years have seen a sharp rise in large-scale disasters. In the Asia and \nPacific region, water-related disasters, more than other types, have increased in frequency. The \nscale and impact of the damage they inflict have also become more serious. Water-related \ndisasters in the region killed around 63,000 people each year on average in 2001\u20132005, 91% of \nthe world\u2019s total. Economic damage resulting from water-related disasters has soared in recent \ndecades, to $466 billion in 1992\u20132001, and the economic losses in 1995\u20132004 were more than \n60 times higher than the losses in 1965\u20131974. Worldwide, flood disasters were responsible for \n84%  of  disaster-related  deaths  (2000\u20132005)  and  65%  of  disaster-related  economic  losses \n(1992\u20132001). More people than ever before live and work in vulnerable floodplains. By 2050, \nmore  than  2  billion  people  are  expected  to  be  at  risk  from  flood  damage.  Furthermore, \nwater-related disasters are expected to intensify with global warming. \n \n10.  The countries participating in the regional TA are all faced with flood risk management \nchallenges. Bangladesh, at the confluence of three major regional river systems, is beset with \n                                                 \n4  Further information on the APWF KnowledgeHubs initiative is available at www.apwf-knowledgehubs.net.  \n5  NARBO  was  formed  in  2004  to  help  introduce  IWRM in  river  basins  and  to  strengthen  the  capacity  and \neffectiveness of river basin organizations in promoting IWRM and improving water governance. NARBO now has \n65 member organizations. Its chair for 2008\u20132010 is from Indonesia and its vice-chair from Sri Lanka. The \nsecretariat comprises the Japan Water Agency, ADB, and ADB Institute. \n ", "3 \nmassive monsoon floods, drainage congestion, and riverbank erosion. Floods also devastate \nIndia with increasing regularity, most recently in 2008 in the states bordering Nepal, and also in \nOrissa state, where incessant rains caused flooding in the Mahanadi river basin. Flooding in the \nlower Mekong river basin countries is an annual event that disrupts economic and human \nactivities, often claims lives, and causes extensive damage to important infrastructure, human \nsettlements, and essential services. Indonesia experiences flooding about 300 times each year, \nwith severe impact on the poor and their livelihood. Flood damage in Java grows more serious \nwith each passing year.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  proposed  TA  will  help  prepare  and  implement  flood  management  investment \nprojects through knowledge and capacity development services that will reduce vulnerability to \nwater-related disasters with in-country and regional assistance. The TA will contribute to the \nachievement of the WFP\u2019s targeted outcome of reducing vulnerability to floods for 100 million \npeople in the Asia and Pacific region. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  proposed  TA  will  have  two  components:  (i)  in-country  project  support,  and \n(ii) program quality support through regional cooperation.  \n \n13.  Project Support. Support will be provided to Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and to the \nMekong  River  Commission  Secretariat.  More  countries  are  expected  to  participate  in  the \nregional cooperation activities under the program quality support component. National executing \nand implementing agencies will be assisted with a package of advisory services and financial \nsupport in formulating and implementing (i) flood management investment projects, strategies, \nand  programs,  including  flood  hazard  mapping  applications;  (ii)  demonstration  projects  to \nimprove flood forecasting and warning through a regional, satellite-supported flood alert system \nwith advanced geophysical data integrating satellite, radar, and ground observations; (iii) action \nresearch on innovative practices in community-managed flood preparedness and disaster risk \nmanagement;  (iv) the  identification  of  \u201cno  regret\u201d  investments  in  flood  management  to \naccommodate the impact of climate change; and (v) capacity development activities, including \ndiagnostic assessments of executing and implementing organizations, in preparation for long-\nterm capacity-building, governance, and training programs.   \n \n14.  In Bangladesh, the TA is expected to support the preparation of the upcoming National \nDisaster Risk Mitigation Project (NDRMP)6 to implement the recommendations of an earlier \nTA7 for early-warning systems studies, which identified 22 high-priority improvements in the \nflood forecasting strategy of Bangladesh. The proposed TA will extend the scope of NDRMP to \ncover water-related disaster management including storm surges, river erosion management, \nand  improved  flood  forecasting.  Its  output  will  be  used  in  the  design  of  ADB\u2019s  project \n                                                 \n6  The project preparatory TA is scheduled for 2010 and the TA loan is expected in 2011. \n7  ADB. 2005.

In India, the TA is expected to support the National Disaster Management Authority in \npreparing the National Flood Mitigation Project, developing the capacity of the newly created \nstate disaster management authorities as appropriate, and facilitate the preparation, planning, \nand implementation of state level water disaster management projects in India. International \ngood  practices  in  comprehensive  risk  mitigation,  integrated  planning  for  long-term  flood \nmanagement  in  river  basins,  nonstructural  flood  risk  management,  and  community-based \nparticipatory flood risk management, as well as capacity building in the states, are expected to \nbe analyzed and exchanged. \n \n16.  In Indonesia, the TA is expected to support improvements in (i) flood management \nstrategy and implementation in the Bengawan Solo river basin, shared by the Central and East \nJava  provinces  (ADB  and  NARBO  will  help  prepare  a  road  map  for  a  long-term  IWRM \ninvestment program for that purpose); and (ii) community-managed structural and nonstructural \nflood  management  interventions  in  the  Jratunseluna  river  basin  territory  in  Central  Java \nprovince.  \n \n17.  The Mekong River Commission Secretariat will be supported in developing flood and \ndrought vulnerability indices for the lower Mekong basin, which have been identified as a priority \nrequirement for preparing further investment projects.   \n \n18.  Program Quality Support. To improve knowledge networking and regional cooperation \namong interested DMCs and development partners in the Asia and Pacific region (i) workshops \nand  exchange  visits  among  professionals  will  be  held  to  share  experiences  in  flood \nmanagement;  (ii)  climate  change  adaptation  effects  will  be  incorporated  into  flood  risk \nmanagement; (iii) river basin organizations will be trained in flood risk management for NARBO; \n(iv)  training  will  be  provided  to  make  flood  risk  management  an  integral  part  of  city \npreparedness planning, through city networks like CityNet; (v) policy and institutional training \nelements will be developed for ICHARM\u2019s master\u2019s degree program in disaster management, \nwith a link to local action research in the participating countries; (vi) a pool of regional experts \nwill be organized to improve flood management and emergency response services; (vii) a \nregional index for in-country water-related disaster preparedness will be developed to introduce \nperformance  benchmarking  and  improvement  through  project  investments  and  capacity \ndevelopment;  and  (viii)  a  comparative  study  of  institutional  arrangements  for  flood  risk \nmanagement in the region will be made. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $2.0 million. The proposed TA will be \nfinanced by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of \nJapan. The cost of the in-country project support component is estimated at $1.4 million, 70% of \nthe total TA cost, and the cost of the regional program quality support component at $0.6 \nmillion, or 30%. ICHARM will contribute in-kind support for staff time, research operations, and \nadministrative and support costs. The cost estimates are shown in Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB,  through  the  Sustainable  Infrastructure  Division  and  the  Public  Management, \nGovernance,  and  Participation  Division  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment, will be the Executing Agency of the TA. These divisions will collaborate with the \nBasin Water Stream of ADB\u2019s Water Community of Practice, concerned regional departments, \nand  resident  missions.  Team  members  from  the  regional  departments  will  coordinate  the \nimplementation of the in-country project support component. ICHARM, the APWF\u2019s regional \nwater  knowledge  hub  for  disaster  risk  reduction  and  flood  management,  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agency.  Throughout  the  implementation  of  the  TA\u2019s  in-country  and  regional \ncomponents, ICHARM will collaborate closely with ADB headquarters, resident missions, and \nproject  clients  and  their  consultants.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  only  after  (i)  ADB  and \nICHARM sign an agreement to that effect, and (ii) ADB approves a detailed work program for \neach component. No activity financed by the TA will be undertaken in a DMC unless ADB has \nreceived a no-objection from the Government of the concerned DMC and in particular, the \nGovernments  of  the  DMCs  which  will  benefit  from  the  project  support  component  will  be \nrequired to confirm their no-objection to the activities to be undertaken in their territory under the \nproject support component before these activities can take place. \n \n21.  ICHARM is expected to hire six international consultants (42 person-months) and six \nnational  consultants  (52  person-months)  to  provide  expertise  in  water-related  disaster \nmanagement and climate change adaptation and thus help achieve the intended impact and \noutcome of the TA. ADB may also hire a TA coordinator for 12 person-months to monitor and \ncoordinate out of ADB headquarters the implementation of the TA activities with ADB\u2019s Water \nCommunity of Practice and regional departments. All consultants will be hired according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. Equipment will be procured according \nto ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). At the end of the \nproject, equipment purchased under the TA will be assigned to the concerned agencies in the \ndeveloping countries. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from May 2009 to April 2011. ICHARM will \nsubmit  (i)  an  inception  report  at  the  end  of  the  3rd  month  after  mobilization;  (ii) quarterly \nprogress reports; (iii) an interim report at the end of the 12th month; (iv) a draft final report at the \nend  of  the  22nd  month;  and  (v)  a  final  report  with  the  comments  of  ADB,  clients  in  the \nparticipating countries, and other stakeholders invited by ADB. The TA\u2019s outputs will be posted \non ADB\u2019s website. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION  \n23.
