INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  July  2006,  the  Board  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  regional \ntechnical assistance (TA) in the amount of $1.35 million to build financial institution capacity.1 The \nTA aimed to strengthen and deepen the capacity of financial institutions in which ADB makes \nprivate  sector  investments  by  supporting  their  development  in  four  key  areas:  (i)  corporate \ngovernance,  (ii)  anti-money  laundering  and  anticorruption,  (iii)  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system efforts, and (iv) financing strategies for small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs). As structured, the TA allowed ADB flexibility in offering customized support to individual \nfinancial institutions through the provision of assistance in any or all of the above key areas. The \nproceeds  of  the  TA  were  effectively  used  to  strengthen  and  deepen  the  capacity  of  several \nfinancial institutions. Such activities included supporting the development of the operational risk \nmanagement procedures and SME financing strategies for one bank in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina,  strengthening  the  anti-money-laundering  policies  of  another  bank  and  building  an \nenvironmental management system for a third bank in that country. Proceeds from the TA were \nalso used to assist a bank in Afghanistan in (i) strengthening its anti-money-laundering processes \nand procedures, (ii) building its environmental and social management system, and (iii) developing \nits SME financing strategies.  \n \n2.  As mentioned in the TA completion report, the overall assessment of the TA was successful. \nThe design enabled each financial institution to receive exactly the type of technical assistance \nrequired in an expedited manner. Also, having the project planning and coordination committee at \nthe financial institution proved critical in managing the process and ensuring that the TA content \nwas tailored to the needs of the institution. Changes recommended by the consultants were in \nlarge part implemented by all the institutions; however, it is acknowledged that the institutions may \nneed to make more changes to fully meet international best practices.  \n \n3.  Based on the successful utilization of this first TA, ADB would like to establish a new \nregional facility in the amount of $1.12 million to provide timely technical assistance to eligible \nfinancial institutions in the above-mentioned and certain other areas, and in doing so increase the \ndevelopment impact of ADB\u2019s interventions. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.2 In consideration of lessons learned during the first TA, some selection criteria will be adjusted in \nthis TA. As this TA was not included in any country partnership strategy or country operations \nbusiness plan, concept approval was obtained from all relevant vice-presidents on 29 November \n2010. \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  ADB financial institution interventions via its private sector window include (i) the filling of \nmarket gaps through creation of new institutions; (ii) the provision of regulatory capital (equity, \nsubordinated debt, other capital instruments) to key institutions to support capital ratios and asset \nexpansion; (iii) the provision of funding (e.g., additional liquidity, longer tenors, foreign or domestic \ncurrencies) to key institutions to expand assets and improve asset\u2013liability management; and (iv) \ntargeted onlending programs to priority sectors such as microfinance, SMEs, leasing, infrastructure, \nhousing,  trade  finance,  and  clean  energy  (via  debt  facilities  and  partial  credit  guarantees). \nInterventions  can  take  the  form  of  lending  (e.g.,  loans,  bonds),  equity  investments,  hybrid \ninstruments (e.g., preferred stock, subordinated debt, convertible debt), partial credit and political \nrisk guarantees, and other suitable instruments.   \n \n5.  The financial institutions with which ADB chooses to work are high-potential entities that \nwould benefit from financial assistance and strategic and operational improvements provided by \nADB as part of an ongoing effort to increase know-how transfer and capacity building. In line with \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Financial Institutions. Manila. (TA 6332\u2013REG). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB\u2019s website on 15 December 2010. \n ", "2   \nits  Strategy  20203 and  the  various  financial  sector  road  maps  and  country  strategies,  ADB \nprioritized four areas of such capacity building: (i) corporate governance and internal controls; (ii) \nanti-money-laundering,  anti-terrorism,  and  anticorruption  efforts;  (iii)  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards;  and  (iv)  microfinance,  SMEs,  housing,  infrastructure,  and  clean  energy  financing \nstrategies. The underdevelopment of these aspects of operation by financial institutions in ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries constrains their business on several levels: \n(i)  Corporate governance and internal controls. Poor corporate governance in the areas of \nrisk management and internal controls may take the form of non-transparent audit results, \nlack  of  independence  of  audit  or  risk  management  functions,  inappropriate  credit \nassignment authority, etc. All of these can lead to difficulties in meeting listing requirements \nfor initial public offerings, attracting strategic investors, and engaging in other activities likely \nfor growing companies.   \n(ii) Anti-money-laundering, anti-terrorism, and anticorruption efforts. Financial institutions \noften  face  potential  problems  with  money  laundering,  corruption,  and  fraud  that  could \ndamage them and generate perceived risk among depositors and investors, undermining \nthe customer trust that is essential for sound growth.4 \n(iii) Environmental  and  social  safeguards.  Good  environmental  and  social  management \nsystems and policies signal that a corporation will contribute to environmental and social \nsafeguard protection, and is also dedicated to managing risks and opportunities intelligently \nwhile gaining a long-term competitive business advantage in the market.  The development \nand implementation of such systems and policies, however, can often prove challenging to \nundertake without outside expertise.    \n(iv) Financing  strategies.  Although  the  market  has  huge  potential  for  many  financial \ninstitutions, it can often be difficult for them to determine the right strategies for penetrating \nor extending their reach into particular sectors, such as microfinance, SMEs, housing, \ninfrastructure, and clean energy.  Even if they are active in these sectors, they may lack the \nproper risk management systems to engage responsibly in these activities.   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Selection Criteria \n6.  The  TA  will  target  financial  institutions  that  are,  or  are  expected  to  become,  ADB\u2019s \nborrowers and investees.  \n7.  Country selection. The financial sector in each country has its own needs with respect to \nADB\u2019s private sector focus areas. The assessment of these needs, especially the analysis of a \ncountry\u2019s financial sector for shortcomings, is based on various sources, including the country \nprogram strategy and private sector assessment, third-party research, and bespoke research. The \nspecified needs will be customized within ADB\u2019s private sector skill set, strategic themes, and focus \nareas, and will warrant different types of interventions.  \n \n8.  Given the limited size of the TA, country selection was determined in line with the then-\ncurrent strategy of ADB\u2019s Capital Markets and Financial Sectors Division (PSCM), and assistance \nwas focused on private sector operations in certain key markets such as the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, India, and the Philippines, with consideration given to other countries such as Indonesia, \nKazakhstan, Pakistan, and Viet Nam. It is proposed that the new TA also follow PSCM\u2019s strategic \npriorities, as well as those identified in the country program strategies. As detailed in the PSCM \nBusiness Plan and Priorities 2010\u20132012, there is greater emphasis on particular business lines \nand frontier countries. It is expected that this TA can be offered to financial institutions throughout \nthe region.  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132010. Manila. \n4  B. Bartlett, 2002. The Negative Effects of Money Laundering on Economic Development. Manila: ADB. \n ", "  3\n9.  Individual financial institution selection. From a business perspective, ADB will seek to \ncalibrate its interventions within an engagement spectrum that balances the variety of selected \ntransactions with varying degrees of (i) commercial risk, (ii) financial return, (iii) development \neffectiveness, and (iv) opportunistic market demand. The goal of this approach is to achieve a \nsustainable  deal  flow  that  encompasses  robust  flow  transactions,  high-impact  but  higher-risk \ndevelopmental deals, and responsive interventions by market-driven requests from ADB\u2019s private \nsector partners.5 It is these criteria that will ultimately guide selection of the individual financial \ninstitutions eligible for intervention and the TA. \n \n10.  Most of ADB\u2019s private sector business is based on direct requests to ADB from the private \nsector. However, ADB does also seek its own business origination by proposing to its private \nsector clients certain business opportunities. In addition, there is a certain amount of referral \nbusiness from existing contacts, as well as other multilateral and bilateral development banks. \nImportantly, regardless of the channel used to select a particular financial institution (i.e., for ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector intervention), ADB expects that the selected institution, once deemed fit for an ADB \nprivate sector investment, would also be assessed and deemed qualified to receive assistance (if \nrequired) under the criteria of this TA. \n \n11.  Under the first TA, preference was given to financial institutions in which ADB had made an \nequity investment, as opposed to those provided with ADB loans or guarantees. In order to extend \nthe technical assistance to the institutions most in need, this TA will be agnostic to the modality of \nintervention and focus on the greatest level of financial sector development.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  Impact. The anticipated impact of the TA is to strengthen and deepen the capacity of \nfinancial institutions in which ADB makes private sector investments (equity, loans, guarantees) by \nimproving  corporate  governance,  combating  money  laundering  and  corruption,  improving \nenvironment  and  social  safeguards,  and  boosting  penetration  into  the  microfinance,  SMEs, \nhousing, infrastructure, and clean energy markets. These measures will help ensure that the \nimpact of ADB\u2019s private sector investments is as high as possible.  \n \n13.  Each activity funded by this TA will have its own development impact framework and \nspecific indicators. Such indicators will include (i) stronger corporate governance and internal \ncontrols,  (ii)  increased  ability  to  recognize  money-laundering  transactions,  (iii)  adoption  of  an \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009), and (iv) development of suitable financing strategies.  \n \n14.  Outcome. With the help of this TA, the capacity of selected financial institutions will be \nstronger and deeper in the specified areas as a result of strengthened policies, procedures, and \nstrategies, thus improving their potential contributions to their respective financial sectors as well \nas their overall performance. \n \n15.  Outputs. The expected outputs will depend on and be tailored to the selected financial \ninstitution and intervention according to the needs of the institution, as specified jointly by the \ninstitution and ADB. However, any given TA will likely (i) review, formulate, and redraft the financial \ninstitution\u2019s policies and procedures for corporate governance and internal controls, and conduct \nrelated  workshops;  (ii)  review,  formulate,  and  redraft  policies  and  procedures  against  money \n                                                 \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n5  ADB\u2019s private sector operations seek to duplicate certain successful business models or products (e.g. term loans) to \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nincrease the flow side of its business and the visibility of ADB and PSCM with respect to private sector development in \nthe market. This will, in the long term, increase not only ADB\u2019s market standing and acceptance, but also the impact of \nits  interventions,  i.e.,  ADB\u2019s  development  impact.  This  approach  will  ensure  a  healthy  and  steady  stream  of \ntransactions with a development impact, while bolstering ADB\u2019s long-term market role and viability. Furthermore, \nPSCM seeks to convert developmental pilot transactions into replicable business models and products. \n ", "4   \nlaundering, terrorism, and corruption, and conduct related training workshops; (iii) hold workshops \non environmental and social safeguard training, and help formulate policies for such safeguards; \nand (iv) review, formulate, and redraft microfinance, SMEs, housing, infrastructure, and/or clean \nenergy financing strategies. \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The methodology and key activities of the TA will depend on the specific institution and \nintervention proposed. However, likely activities and sub-activities will include: \n(i)  Corporate governance and internal controls. Funding would be used to \n(a) provide training to senior staff on general corporate governance issues; \n(b) advise management on internationally accepted best practices for internal controls;  \n(c) examine  the  financial  institution\u2019s  organizational  structure,  particularly  the  extent  of \nseparation of managerial roles and responsibilities between various departments and \nrisk management groups or committees; assess whether sufficient safeguards exist to \nensure effective internal controls and oversight; \n(d) report  on  observations  and  recommendations  based  on  best  practices,  including \nrecommending amendments or changes to internal control policies and procedures, and \nstreamlining current systems; and \n(e) help revise the internal control policies and procedures. \n(ii) Anti-money-laundering, anti-terrorism, and anticorruption efforts. Funding would be \nused to: \n(a) review  and  assess  current  anti-money-laundering,  anti-terrorism,  and  anticorruption \npolicies and procedures; \n(b) report  on  observations  and  recommendations  based  on  best  practices,  including \nrecommending amendments or changes to anti-money-laundering, anti-terrorism, and \nanticorruption policies and procedures, and streamlining current systems;  \n(c) help revise the anti-money-laundering, anti-terrorism, and anticorruption policies and \nprocedures; \n(d) design trainings and undertake a workshop on anti-money-laundering, anti-terrorism, \nand anticorruption awareness and safeguards; and \n(e) help management decide how to approach technology enablement and/or support for \nsuspicious-transaction  reporting  and  know-your-customer  processes  with  respect  to \nanti-money-laundering efforts. \n(iii) Environmental and social management system. Funding would be used to: \n(a) develop  and  conduct  a  workshop  on  environmental  issues  and  safeguard  training. \nOutputs could include: training curriculum and materials; better understanding and skills \nof  workshop  participants  in  identifying  and  managing  environmental  risks;  greater \nawareness of business opportunities for sustainability of products and services; and \ngreater  awareness  of  workshop  participants  of  national  environmental  safeguard \npolicies and requirements. \n(b) Assist in developing and drafting an environmental and social management system in \ncompliance with national laws and regulations. \n(iv) Financing strategies. Funding would be used to \n(a) review available financing products for microfinance, SMEs, housing, infrastructure, \nand/or clean energy; \n(b) review the regulatory environment; \n(c) review  financing  and  product  needs  of  the  customer  base  and  potential  customer \nsegments; \n(d) provide  international  benchmarks  for  microfinance,  SMEs,  housing,  infrastructure, \nand/or clean energy financing and products, and risk mitigation and concerns; \n ", "  5\n(e) develop financing strategies for microfinance, SMEs, housing, infrastructure, and/or \nclean energy; and \n(f)  help develop financing products that would expand the institution\u2019s offerings. \nD.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,120,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF IV). The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. It should be noted that the cost of implementing the suggested \nrecommendations pursuant to the TA will be borne by the selected financial institution. In other \nwords, ADB will undertake a gap analysis, for instance of anti-money-laundering efforts, review \npolicies and procedures, and advise the institution on the next steps. The institution will then install \nnew information technology systems at its own cost based on the analysis undertaken by ADB. \nADB will seek reimbursement of the TA out of ensuing assistance, to the extent possible. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be executed and implemented by ADB, with the Private Sector Operations \nDepartment (PSOD) as the focal point. ADB, through PSOD, will be responsible for all technical \nimplementation issues. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will \nbe implemented over 48 months from the start date, coinciding with the approval date of the TA. \n \n19.  Pursuant to the guidelines detailed in ADB\u2019s Operations Manual on TA,6 any activity under \nthe TA will begin only after receiving a no-objection letter from the government of the country in \nwhich the financial institution is located. \n \n20.  The TA activities will be implemented with the help of international and national consultants \nand firms. The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. The consultants for the \ncorporate  governance  and  internal  controls  module,  and  for  the  anti-money-laundering,  anti-\nterrorism, and anticorruption module will be engaged via the consultant qualification selection \nprocess in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). These modules will require 32 person-months of international consultant services.  \n \n21.  The consultants for the environmental and social management system module, and the \nfinancing strategies module will be chosen as individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Up to 16 individual consultants will be recruited to conduct \nthe environmental and social management system and the financing strategies modules. These \nmodules will entail 10 person-months of national individual and 36 person-months of international \nindividual consultant services. \n \n22.  ADB  and  each  TA  recipient  will  form  a  project  planning  and  coordination  committee, \ncomprising  representatives  at  appropriate  levels  from  the  financial  institution  and  ADB.  The \ncoordination  committee  will  organize  regular  consultative  meetings  and  a  final  dissemination \nworkshop followed by discussions of the findings. The institution will nominate officers and senior \nmanagers for the training component related to environmental and social safeguards. (Appendix 4 \npresents further details on this training component.)  \nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n23.

Risk Management and Internal Control \n \n1.  International firms will be recruited that have high-level qualifications and significant \nexperience in evaluating operations risk management and internal controls to ensure that the \nproper internal oversight structures are in place. One international firm will be selected for each \nengagement with a given financial institution (institution) through the Consultant Qualification \nSelection process in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). The firm will have prior experience on similar projects in financial \ninstitutions in the country in which the technical assistance (TA) is being employed. Each \nengagement will require approximately 4 international consultants intermittently for 2\u20136 person-\nmonths, depending on the extent of the work needed for the given financial institution. Up to 4 \nengagements for this module are estimated.  \n \n2.
