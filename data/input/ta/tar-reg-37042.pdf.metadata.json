The resident missions (RMs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Cambodia, Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Viet Nam (collectively, the countries are herein \ncalled CLV) have been stepping up knowledge management by making the RMs more active as \ndevelopment resource centers. In these transition economies, as a multilateral institution and a \nregional bank, ADB is perceived by the governments and civil society as being close to the \ncountry and knowledgeable about the region\u2019s needs and aspirations. This presents ADB with \nan opportunity to catalyze, at the country level, its knowledge management role in promoting \nsocial  and  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction.  ADB\u2019s  extensive  developmental \nknowledge and experience need to be shared, at the country level, in a structured, systematic \nas well as sensitive way. This is particularly because a major challenge in these transition \neconomies is that the specific institutional context of the country is important. Frameworks and \npolicies that may apply elsewhere have to be carefully adapted, and workable approaches and \nimplementable  policies  evolved,  taking  into  account  the  country-specific  sociopolitical  and \ninstitutional context.  \n  \n2.  Against this backdrop, during 2002, the Viet Nam Resident Mission (VRM) initiated a \nproposal to undertake, in-country, a program of policy and operations-oriented research and \nanalytical work focusing on selected key issues, sectors, and cross-cutting themes within the \nframework of ADB\u2019s strategic operational agenda and priorities in Viet Nam, as reflected in the \nCountry Strategy and Program (CSP) that was endorsed by the Board in January 2002. Also \nduring 2002, the Department for International Development (DFID) of the Government of the \nUnited  Kingdom  conducted  a  government-donor  workshop  in  Hanoi  where  it  presented  a \nframework paper on its Making Markets Work Better for the Poor initiative.1 As a result of follow-\nup consultations between DFID and VRM, DFID offered to provide cofinancing to work jointly \nwith ADB on this initiative in Viet Nam, under the unifying theme of Making Markets Work Better \nfor the Poor, as this reflects the high priority that both institutions give to poverty reduction and \npro-poor growth. Subsequently, and in coordination with ADB RMs in Cambodia and Lao PDR, \nthe country coverage on this initiative was proposed to be extended, utilizing the regional \ntechnical assistance (RETA) modality, especially as Cambodia and Lao PDR are transition \neconomies with broadly similar structural problems and development challenges.2 The Asian \nDevelopment Bank Institute (ADBI) has agreed to join this initiative as a parallel financier and \nknowledge partner, particularly for the Cambodia and Lao PDR parts of the program.  \n \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n3.  Viet  Nam  achieved  remarkable  economic  and  social  progress  during  the  1990s, \nessentially halving poverty between 1990 and 2000. Building on previous high levels of human \ncapital and social development, the progress was largely the result of a shift towards a more \nmarket-oriented economy, particularly in the agriculture sector, coupled with more equitable \ndistribution of assets (land) and macroeconomic stability. As a transition economy, the country \nis characterized by a strong sense of history, independence, and resoluteness. The transition \nfrom a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy to date has been through a mixture of \npart good policy, part sheer necessity, and part finding ways around structural impediments \n                                                 \n1  DFID. 2000. Making Markets Work Better for the Poor. Framework Paper presented during the Government-Donor \nWorkshop, Hanoi, November; World Bank. 2000/2001. World Development Report 2000/2001: Attacking Poverty (devoted \na chapter on this theme, with a similar title). Hanoi. \n2  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities Internet Edition on 26 February 2003. ", " 2\nsuch  as  weaknesses  in  certain  policy  areas  and  opaqueness  in  the  public  administration \nsystem. \n  \n4.  Viet Nam is moving from a stage where broad-brush market-oriented reforms were \ninitially required, to a situation where more focused and deeper reforms are now needed in \nspecific areas. Notably, the efficiency of resource allocation in the non-agriculture sectors must \nbe improved to generate the needed employment through the development of a domestic \nprivate sector. This will require the further development of land, labor, and financial institutions \nand knowledge markets. \n \n5.  Recent pronouncements \u2014 from constitutional amendments to the 10-year strategy, 5-\nyear  plan,  and  the  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \n(CPRGS) \u2014 confirm the intention to continue along the path of further development of markets \nand market institutions. Local administrations (Ho Chi Minh City, Binh Duong Province) have \ntaken innovative and successful approaches to market development. The operations of many \nofficial development assistance (ODA) partners of Viet Nam are being reoriented to focus more \nsharply  on  poverty  reduction  and  private  sector  development.  However,  progress  towards \npoverty reduction and market liberalization can be slowed down by a number of risk factors. For \ninstance, the nature of the needed reforms is now more complex, and requires more in-depth \ntechnical assessment of the functioning of local markets and of the obstacles to their further \ndevelopment. Equally important is to look into the implications at the local level of the increasing \nopenness of CLV as part of the ASEAN Free Trade Area commitments and preparation for \nWorld Trade Organization accession and find ways to minimize short-run costs to poor people. \nPoor people in rural areas also suffer particular difficulties both in having their voice heard, i.e., \nlack of participation in policy making, and in accessing competitive markets. Detailed knowledge \nof local governance in market development, particularly the respective roles of markets and \nstate and local institutions, would help refine the policy and institutional framework meant for \npro-poor growth. Also, while Viet Nam has been placing greater importance on decentralization \nand more balanced regional development, lesions learned from successful experiences at the \nlocal level are not being systematically documented and disseminated. Many of the policy \nimplications of CPRGS implementation still need to be fleshed out. While Viet Nam\u2019s ODA \npartners place high priority on poverty reduction, the broad reorientation of ODA programs \ntowards poverty reduction, while intended, is not fully supported by a detailed understanding of \nhow project design and the accompanying policy measures must be modified to place greater \nreliance  on  markets  and  associated  institutions.  ADB  therefore  has  a  strong  incentive  to \nimprove the understanding of how markets can be made to work better for the poor. ADB is also \nin the position to support implementation of the findings directly through its projects in Viet Nam \nand indirectly through policy dialogue with the Government. \n \n6.  Cambodia and Lao PDR while at different levels in their transition to market orientation, \nhave been making steady progress in their pursuit of reforms. These issues and risk factors are \nalso relevant and applicable to these two transition economies. There is, therefore, now a \nunique opportunity to consolidate the emphasis on market-based and pro-poor growth in CLV, \nas broadly outlined in their respective national poverty reduction strategies, such as in CPRGS \nin the case of Viet Nam. This is by fostering applied research and analysis; taking stock of \nrecent pilot experiences, both in-country and best practices abroad; and translating the findings \ninto concrete recommendations for a next round of more specific market-oriented reforms and \nimproved design of ODA operations. To achieve these objectives, it is necessary that the \nresearch, policy analysis, and diagnostic work be (i) linked to specific government priorities and \nODA initiatives; (ii) perceived as unbiased and of technically high standards; (iii) developed in ", "  3\n \nclose cooperation with local institutions; and (iv) disseminated through a variety of appropriate \nchannels, thereby contributing to the development debate and policy-making process. \n \n7.  The  proposed  RETA  will  therefore  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  proactively \ncatalyze and practice knowledge management by supporting and facilitating policy makers and \neconomic managers to steer the economies of CLV progressively towards greater use of market \ninstruments while avoiding the rolling back of earlier social gains, the latter as evidenced in \nmany  other  transition  economies.  Effective  implementation  would  involve  identification  of \nstrategic sectors, and policy and institutional reforms that are path dependent. The underlying \nconcern would be to strive for a balance between the roles of the markets, the state, and civil \nsociety, i.e., a blend that embodies the uniqueness of the situation in each country reflecting \nnationally defined priorities, values, and circumstances including social, political, regional, and \ncultural ones. In this sense, the RETA is country-focused and also very much process oriented, \nas it will bring policy analysts, and those influencing policy decision making face to face with the \nimportant questions of development and the challenge to make the policy trade-offs and choices \nboth consistently and in an informed manner.   \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Outputs  \n \n8.   The  overall  goal  of  the  program  of  activities  under  the  RETA  is  to  enhance  the \nknowledge and understanding of the links between growth and poverty and the dynamics of \nmarkets and institutions with a view to facilitating sustainable economic growth and poverty \nreduction. The purposes are to (i) undertake substantive analytical research and diagnostic \nwork focused on operational and policy issues linked to further development of markets in each \ncountry to achieve more pro-poor development outcomes; (ii) network and collaborate in each \ncountry with selected centers of excellence and local researchers to jointly undertake such \nanalyses, apply the outcomes in policy dialogue with the respective governments, and assist \nthem in the policy making process; and (iii) through these process activities, help build local \ncapacity to undertake applied policy-oriented research. The RETA will address specific reform \nmeasures under consideration by the governments of CLV, and underpin implementation of \nADB's poverty reduction strategy embedded in the CSP and poverty partnership agreements in \nCLV. It will support and facilitate dialogue among government agencies, stakeholders including \nthe  poor,  the  private  sector,  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  partners,  and \nnongovernment organizations. \n \n9.   Key outputs and deliverables will include (i) a number of analytical studies and research \npapers  on  priority  operational  and  policy  issues  linked  to  market  development  and  their \ninteractions for poverty reduction; (ii) stronger local capacity to analyze and develop policies for \npro-poor growth; (iii) stronger research networks for exchange of knowledge products and policy \ndebate; (iv) enhanced policy dialogue between government and other stakeholders; and (v) \nincreased awareness about making markets work better for the poor. The emphasis will be on \nresults  and  outputs  of  a  concrete  nature  that  are  of  immediate  use  in  government  policy \nformulation and ODA project design. In addition, the RETA will generate and disseminate the \nresults of field surveys through discussion papers, policy briefs, and workshop and conference \nproceedings.  It  will  build  local  research  capacity  through  its  learning-by-doing  approach, \nnetworking,  and  dissemination  of  knowledge  products.  There  will  be  a  dedicated  website, \nregular  e-discussion  on  priority  issues,  and  exchange  of  information  and  ideas.  The  goal, \npurpose, outputs, activities and inputs are summarized in the TA Framework in Appendix 1.  ", " 4\nB.   Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n10.  The RETA will identify and carry out a number of surveys and studies aimed at better \nunderstanding the link between poverty and broad-based sustainable growth, and between the \ndevelopment of specific markets and poverty reduction. A mapping of the priority areas for \ninvestigation  will  be  carried  out  by  identifying  the  various  markets  affecting  poor  people\u2019s \nlivelihood, on the basis of some typical situations, such as that of rice farmers, perennial crop \ngrowers, household and small entrepreneurs and artisans, unregistered urban migrants, and \nethnic minority households in remote areas. The specific markets and institutions, that have the \npotential to affect the poor under these categories, are land, labor, capital (credit, savings), \nproducts and services (including infrastructure, health, education, and social security), and \ninstitutions including government policies and procedures and community-based initiatives and \nassociations.  \n  \n11.  Each government and their think tanks, ADB\u2019s knowledge departments and concerned \nsector  divisions,  and  other  concerned  ODA  partners  will  be  consulted  before  the  priority \nresearch agenda for each country for the first year will be confirmed. The topics will be linked to \ngovernment reform efforts and/or the design of related ADB operations, and will investigate \nissues for which there are concerns that market mechanisms are not adequately developed, or \nthat their use may not be leading to pro-poor outcomes. Implementation of the RETA will \ntherefore follow a cluster approach and a participatory process, with at least three research \nstudies selected and implemented during the first year. The focus will be on providing concrete \nanswers to specific policy questions, relying on empirical analyses. Based on the outcome of \nthe first year of activities and on evolving development priorities in each country, the research \nagenda for the second year will be selected. The same approach will be followed for the third \nyear. \n \n12.   Participating researchers in the studies will be selected from among national research \ninstitutes  or  universities  or  as  individuals  on  a  competitive  research  proposal  basis  (see \nAppendix 2 for an indicative list). They will carry out the research under the supervision of \ninternational sector specialists engaged under the RETA. Their methodologies, work progress, \nand  findings  will  be  discussed  at  inception,  midterm,  and  final  workshops.  To  ensure \ninternationally acceptable research standards and high quality recommendations, all research \nreports will be reviewed by an international panel of up to three distinguished experts engaged \nunder the RETA. There will be annual conferences during RETA implementation to present the \noutcome and policy recommendations from the completed research projects, discuss emerging \npriority topics, and identify the following year\u2019s work program. CLV policy makers will participate \nin the conferences and their deliberations.  \n \n13.   The findings and processes will also be relevant for other transitional countries in the \nregion served by ADB and for developing countries elsewhere. Mechanisms will be established \nin coordination with the knowledge departments at ADB headquarters to facilitate diffusion of \nthe findings in addition to the printed and electronic publications under the RETA. The RETA will \nbe implemented in cooperation with ongoing research efforts on selected topics being carried \nout by ADB knowledge departments and sector divisions and ADBI.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n14.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $2.40 million equivalent over a 3-year period, \nto be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program in an amount of $200,000 \nequivalent and by the Government of the United Kingdom in an amount of  $2 million equivalent ", "  5\n \nfor project coordination and activities based in Viet Nam (Appendix 3). The cost will cover (i) \ninternational and domestic resource persons; (ii) workshops, seminars, and conferences; (iii) \nlocal  researchers,  field  surveys,  and  data  collection;  (iv)  travel  expenses;  and  (v)  project \nadministration  costs,  including  administrative  assistants,  interpreters/translators, \ncommunications,  printing,  domestic  travel,  and  office  equipment  (including  office  furniture, \ncomputers, printers, etc.) and supplies. In addition, ADBI will finance, in parallel, research \nstudies and capacity-building activities, especially in Cambodia and Lao PDR, in a manner \nconsistent with the objective and scope of the RETA, in an amount not exceeding $200,000 \nequivalent during the RETA implementation period. Based on progress and performance during \nthe initial implementation, additional financing or cofinancing may be pursued for activities in \nCambodia and Lao PDR for subsequent years. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nis given in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n15.   RETA implementation will be guided by an advisory committee (AC), with a coordinator \nbased in VRM under the supervision of a senior VRM staff member and with the VRM country \ndirector serving as the RETA director. The AC's members will comprise CLV resident mission \ncountry directors, ADB staff selected from the knowledge departments and sector divisions as \nappropriate, a DFID representative, and an ADBI representative. As necessary and appropriate, \nAC will draw on technical advice and inputs from the international panel of experts.  \n \n16.   ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, with VRM responsible for overall RETA \nmanagement  and  for  the  Viet  Nam-related  RETA  activities;  the  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR \nresident missions, in coordination with ADBI, will be responsible for the Cambodia and Lao \nPDR-related  RETA  activities,  respectively.  The  RETA  will  require  36  person-months  of  a \ncoordinator,  50  person-months  of  economists;  20  person-months  of  international  sector \nspecialists, 6 person-months equivalent for the panel of distinguished international experts, and \n225  person-months  of  participating  domestic  researchers.  Terms  of  reference  for  these \npositions and also an indicative implementation schedule are given in Appendix 4.  \n \n17.   The  coordinator  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  consultant  basis  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  international  panel  of  distinguished  experts, \ninternational sector specialists, and other domestic and international experts for the workshops \nand  conferences  will  be  engaged  as  resource  persons  (on  a  retainer  basis).  Domestic \nparticipants/researchers will be selected following a competitive research proposal basis and \nengaged on an individual basis. The RETA will commence in July 2003 and will be completed \nby December 2006.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n18.   The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 for Making Markets Work \nBetter for the Poor, to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom. If \nthe Board approves ADB administering the portion of the technical assistance to be financed by \nthe Government of the United Kingdom, the President, acting under the authority delegated by \nthe Board, shall approve the technical assistance to be financed by ADB on a grant basis in an \namount not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \n    \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \nImportant Assumptions \nMeans of \nNarrative Summary  Verifiable Indicators  (and risk mitigating \nVerification \nmeasures) \nGoal       \nTo facilitate the development  Household income  Living standards  \u2022 Studies provide \nof markets to promote  and poverty levels  surveys  concrete and \nsustainable pro-poor      implementable \neconomic growth and more  Survey reports  Sector-specific data  recommendations. \nequitable distribution of its  \u2022 Outcome of studies \nbenefits to accelerate poverty  applied in design of \nreduction  ADB projects and \nGovernment policies \nPurpose       \n(i)  Undertake substantive  Use of study  \u2022 Annual CPRGS  \u2022 Choice of topics is \nanalytical studies  recommendations in  progress reports  relevant for CLV\u2019s \nfocused on operational  the design of  \u2022 Sector level policy  development \nand policy issues linked  government policies  initiatives  challenges (advisory \nto the further  and programs  \u2022 ADB project  committee to oversee) \ndevelopment of market    documents in  \u2022 Government \ninstitutions to achieve    related sectors  participation in annual \nmore pro-poor  Use of study  \u2022 ADB country  conference and choice \ndevelopment outcomes   recommendations in  strategy and  of topics \n(ii)  Network and collaborate  the design of ADB  program updates  \u2022 Study methodology is \n(iii) Build local capacity to  projects  (annual)  sound (quality check \nundertake such analysis    \u2022 ADBI reports  and advice by \nand apply the outcomes      international resource \nin policy dialogue with  persons). \nthe respective \ngovernments and assist \nthem in policy making \nand promote networking \n \nOutputs \n(i)  Analytical studies on  \u2022  Reports on  Resources are used \noperational and policy  different topics  effectively (ADB \nissues linked to markets  related to priority  oversight; close \nand their interactions for  issues produced  implementation \npoverty reduction    supervision). \n(ii)  Stronger national  \u2022  International \ncapacity to analyze and  referees' reports \ndevelop policies for pro- on each study \npoor growth;  report for quality \n(iii) Stronger research  assurance \nnetworks for exchange \nof knowledge products \nand policy debate \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADBI = Asian Development Bank Institute, CLV = Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic \nRepublic, and Viet Nam, CPRGS = Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nImportant Assumptions \nMeans of \nNarrative Summary  Verifiable Indicators  (and risk mitigating \nVerification \nmeasures) \n \nOutputs (continued) \n(iv)  Enhanced policy  \u2022 Number of  Quality not up to \ndialogue between  persons and  standard (quality \ngovernment and other  institutions  assured by peer/expert \nstakeholders     involved in  reviews) \n(v)  Wider dissemination of  dissemination   \nresearch findings on  activities   \nmaking markets work    Weak dissemination \nbetter for the poor  \u2022 Workshops and  (conferences and media \n(vi)  Tabulated and analyzed     other events  coverage, electronic and \nresults of field surveys   organized to  printed publications) \n(vii) Research papers, policy  discuss the   \nbriefs, proposed text of  findings   \nrelevant legislation and   \nregulations on the \nspecific markets \n(viii) Workshops and \nconference proceedings \nActivities \n(i)  Stock taking,  \u2022 Research reports  \u2022 Progress reports  Unforeseen bottlenecks  \nconsultation, research      (RMs will oversee the \nnetworking, and  \u2022 Conferences/  \u2022 AC minutes  overall implementation) \nselection of topics  workshops   \n(ii)  Commissioning of  \u2022 Publications \nresearch \n(iii) Research supervision \n(iv) Annual conferences, \nworkshops,  \n  e-discussions \n(v)  Printed and electronic \npublications.

Processes and Activities To Be Supported by the RETA \n \n1.  The following are some examples of processes and activities to be supported under the \nRETA. \n \n(i)   Applied research on pro-poor market development \n \n(a)  regular consultations with key stakeholders to help identify, and to share \ninformation on, measures to make markets work better for the poor; \n(b)  design and implementation of applied research on challenges to make \nmarkets work better to increase employment and reduce poverty; \n(c)  design and implementation of applied research in selected provinces to \nlearn from experiences and ongoing constraints to facilitating pro-poor \ngrowth; and \n(d)  advice  from  regionally  and  internationally  renowned  researchers  and \npolicy  makers  on  the  design  and  analysis  of  studies  to  provide  an \ninternational comparative perspective to this research.   \n \n(ii)   Stronger networks and capacity for poverty research and information sharing \n \n(a)  quarterly  roundtable  meetings  on  role  of,  and  experiences  with, \ninstitutional development in reducing poverty to discuss issues related to \nthe design and implementation of action-oriented poverty research; \n(b)  links developed between the national network and leading regional and \ninternational institutes working on poverty reduction; \n(c)  increased access of domestic researchers and policy makers to regional \nand international findings on links among market institutions, business \ndevelopment, employment generation, and poverty reduction; \n(d)  international  workshops  on  research  related  to  pro-poor  development \nstrategies, with internationally renowned experts; and \n(e)  media-ready  articles  on  research  on  private  sector  and  employment \nissues, impacts, and success stories. \n \n(iii)  Proactive dialogue on pro-poor market development strategies   \n \n(a)  policy  dialogue  \u2013  facilitated  by  domestic  and  international  experts  \u2013 \namong  senior  policy  makers  on  issues  related  to  pro-poor  market \ndevelopment; \n(b)  publication  and  dissemination  of  recommendations  resulting  from  this \npolicy dialogue; \n(c)  dissemination of information on best practices for ensuring that markets \nwork better for the poor, and for promoting business investment in poor \nareas; \n(d)  regular briefings for local economic journalists, and publication of key \nmessages through the mass media; and \n(e)  support for members of the network in preparing submissions on policy \nand institutional reforms to accelerate poverty reduction; \n \n ", "10   Appendix 2 \n(iv)    Dissemination of research findings to policy makers, aid partners, and potential \nbeneficiaries \n \n(a)  workshops/seminars and conference for dissemination at all levels; \n(b)  publications in hard and electronic copies; and \n(c)  dissemination through media \u2013 radio, TV, and Internet. \n \n \nC.   Indicative Research Topics \n \n2.  The list of possible topics below is purely indicative, and will be redefined based on the \ninception phase of the project. \n(i)   Improving Poor People\u2019s Access to Capital \n \n3.  The key issues will be to identify the main barriers to the poor using their assets (mostly \nlabor, land, crops, and livestock) to raise capital for investment. This could include issues \nrelated to land tenure and titling, land fragmentation, restrictions on land use, mortgage and \nforeclosure  procedures,  labor  mobility,  credit  information,  microfinance  development,  credit \nguarantee, and group liability for borrowing and other approaches to reducing transaction costs. \n \n(ii)   Rural-Urban Migration, Labor Regulation and Mobility, Retraining/Reskilling, and \nPoverty Reduction \n \n4.  A major focus will be on the implications for poverty of rural-urban migration, migrant \nworkers, and labor mobility.
