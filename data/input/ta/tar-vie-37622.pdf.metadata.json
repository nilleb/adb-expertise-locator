During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the  Government of Viet Nam requested \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Upper Secondary and \nProfessional Teacher Development Project. ADB included the Project for a loan of $35 million in \n2006 in its Country Strategy and Program Update for 2004\u20132006. A TA Fact-Finding Mission was \nfielded  to  Viet  Nam  12\u201318  February  2004.  The  Mission  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment on the  objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing \narrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference for the TA.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  Government  effort  for  quality  and  equitable  education  nearly  achieved  universal \nprimary  education  in  2000.  Enrollments  at  the  lower  secondary  schools  during  1993\u20132002 \nexpanded from 3.2 million to 6.5 million with the net enrollment rate (NER) increasing from 30.1% \nin 1993 to 72.1% in 2002.2 Enrollments at the upper secondary level also drastically rose from 0.5 \nmillion to 2.6 million with the NER increasing from 7.2% in 1993 to 41.8% in 2002.3 A similar trend \nis observed in the secondary level professional education, which takes the lower secondary school \ngraduates. The Government recently formulated a policy framework for education development for \nthe next decade through the Vietnamese Education Development Strategy 2001\u201320104 in 2002 \nand the National Education for All Action Plan 2003\u201320155 in 2003, which included (i) universal \nlower  secondary  education  of  high  quality  by  2010,  and  (ii)  expansion  of  upper  secondary \neducation in pace with lower secondary education development.  \n \n3.  ADB has been helping with improvement in the secondary education subsector in Viet Nam \nthrough, among others, three loan and one technical assistance projects. Assistance in lower \nsecondary education included projects for lower secondary education development in 19976 and \npreservice training for lower secondary teachers in 1999.7 In 2000, ADB assisted in preparing a \nsecondary education sector master  plan incorporating lessons and achievements of previous \nprojects and showed a road map to reach the Government\u2019s policy targets.8 Based on the sector \nanalysis  in  the  master  plan  that  indicated  the  upcoming  demand  for  lower  and  then  upper \nsecondary  and  professional  education,  the  Government  started  with  strengthening  upper \nsecondary education. ADB approved an upper secondary education project in 20029 to meet this \nincreasing  demand,  with  provisions  for  in-service  teacher  training  for  initial  implementation. \nNevertheless, to fully realize the benefits and impact of this project in the long run,  first, it is \nnecessary to develop preservice teacher training facilities that provide upper secondary teachers \naccording to the enrollment increase. Second, since secondary education consists of general and \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 8 January 2004.  \n2 Net enrollment rate is a percentage of all students of specific school age enrolled in school over the population of that \nage. \n3 The education system in Viet Nam consists of 5 years of primary, 4 years of lower secondary, 3 years of upper \nsecondary, and by 4\u20136 years of higher education. Professional education provides secondary level professional \neducation and training to lower and upper secondary graduates for 3-4 years and 2 years, respectively. \n4 Ministry of Education and Training. 2002.

There is still no formal preservice and in-service program for teachers in \nprofessional  education  institutes  to  learn  effective  teaching  skills.  Secondary  professional \neducation teachers also need a program to regularly update their technical skills and knowledge to \nkeep technical education relevant. Third, to fulfill these quantitative and qualitative requirements, it \nis necessary to establish a policy and institutional framework for  (i) developing, qualifying, and \nadministering teachers in secondary schools and professional education institutes; (ii)  linking \npreservice and in-service training; and (iii) carrying out  decentralized teacher training with an \naccreditation system.10   \n \n4.  Although external agencies have been active in the education sector\u2014the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World \nBank, and bilateral sources including Japan and the United Kingdom\u2014ADB has been taking the \nlead in the secondary education subsector. The TA is being formulated within the framework of the \nsecondary education sector master plan. The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s country and sector \nstrategy, which acknowledges the master plan as a guide for ADB\u2019s operation in the secondary \neducation sector. In support of the Government National Poverty Reduction Strategy,11 the TA will \ndesign the Project with a focus on inclusive social development by mitigating barriers to the poor \nand disadvantaged people\u2019s training to become teachers.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n5.  The TA aims to assist the Government in preparing the Project to start in 2006. Specifically, \nthe Project will focus on  developing teachers for general and professional education at upper \nsecondary level, addressing (i) the quality and efficiency of teacher development by strengthening \nselected  existing  facilities; 12  (ii)  access  to  preservice  teacher  training  for  people  from \ndisadvantaged areas;13 and (iii) a policy and institutional framework for teacher development. The \npreliminary project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n6.  The TA output will be a project proposal and feasibility study reports14 in standard formats \nand contents for consideration by the Government and ADB.15 The project proposal will include \ndesign and  investment alternatives to  develop a  preservice teacher training  system to meet \nincreasing  enrollments  in  upper  secondary  and  professional  education;  and  compare  the \nalternatives on least-cost and sustainability bases, considering (i) economic, financial, institutional, \npoverty and  social,16 environmental, and other dimensions; and  (ii) the  government\u2019s project \nimplementation  capacity  based on  the current institutional framework and assessment of financial  \n                                                 \n10  Provincial authorities implement teacher training, while  Ministry of Education and Training provides policy and \nguidance for implementation.  \n11  The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. 2002.  The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth \nStrategy. Hanoi. Approved by the Prime Minister at Document No. 2685/VPCP-QHQT, dated 21 May 2002.  \n12  The Project will not consider a new building in a newly  acquired site. Ten teacher training universities and 10 \nuniversities with teacher training faculty are conducting upper secondary teacher training. Two universities and three \ncolleges are offering professional training for teaching in professional institutes at secondary level. The Project will \nfinance facilities specific to the upper secondary teacher training. No involuntary resettlement impact is envisaged. \nLand acquisition and resettlement impacts are not envisaged. However, in the case of unforeseen land acquisition and \nresettlement, consultant resources are available to review and prepare the necessary planning documents. \n13  Article 9, Education Law (No. 11/1998/QH10 December 2, 1998). \n14  The Government requires prefeasibility and feasibility study for appraising the project in parallel to the ADB project \ncycle. The TA needs to help draft the prefeasibility study and feasibility study to ensure their consistency with ADB \nproject documents, compliance with ADB guidelines, and timely appraisal within the Government.   \n15  Format and contents are detailed in the terms of reference for consultants (Appendix 3). \n16  Initial poverty and social analysis in Appendix 1 will be elaborated.  \n ", "  3 \n \ngovernance and management  in  the  executing  agency.  The  proposal  will  include  a  detailed \nprocurement plan and project monitoring indicators with baseline data. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  To achieve the output, activities are organized under four components: (i) conducting \nsituational analysis, (ii) preparing a project proposal, (iii) preparing the government prefeasibility \nstudy (PFS) and feasibility study (FS) reports, and ensuring timely appraisal by the Government; \nand  (iv)  assisting  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  in  establishing  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) and carrying out preparatory actions for implementing the project. The \nmajor risks and assumptions in achieving the outputs are (i) synergies and complementarities with \nprevious  and  ongoing  projects, including introduction of  a  new  curriculum  under  the  upper \nsecondary education project; (ii) diversity of needs and potential demand; and (iii) processing \nschedule in harmony with government procedures. The TA will address these risks by preparing \nthe Project based on (i) what has been or will be achieved under previous and ongoing projects; (ii) \na demand that is already outstanding and a need that could be converted into a demand; and (iii) \noutputs of the Government-ADB harmonization efforts, which are published in the Guidelines on \nADB-Funded Project Processing (GAP).17  \n \n8.  Situational analysis will include (i) demand analysis (demand for preservice teacher training, \npeople\u2019s willingness to pay for the training, gap in the demand for and supply of teachers); (ii) \npolicy  and  institutional  analysis  (the  supply-side  analysis:  who  provides  the  training;  what \nconstraints do the providers face; what is the role of private versus public providers; and what are \nthe policy and institutional needs for training, administering, and developing careers of teachers in \nthe secondary schools and professional institutes  including secondary teacher qualification  and \naccreditation systems for implementing decentralized training); and (iii) a review of teacher training \nfinancing (who pays for teacher training along the line of a fiscal or public expenditure review). The \nanalysis will provide background information for establishing the economic rationale of the Project \nand assess sustainability issues. It will identify provinces that need special support in promoting \nupper secondary education for  teachers with specific skills such as communication in ethnic \nlanguages. \n  \n9.  Demand analysis will estimate the number of teachers to be trained in each subject and \nprovince18 to (i) meet the shortage of teachers in high enrollment areas, and (ii) carry out supply-\nside interventions by teachers with specific skills to mitigate barriers to upper secondary education \nin disadvantaged areas where enrollment is still considerably lower (Appendix 2). Demands to be \nconsidered include students\u2019 demand for upper secondary education, students\u2019 demand for teacher \ntraining,  and  labor market demands for trained students, together with  the  potential  for  cost \nrecovery based on people\u2019s willingness to pay. The project design will incorporate students\u2019 \ndemand for upper secondary education by examining the new curriculum developed under the \nupper  secondary  education  project.  For  labor  market  orientation,  especially  in  professional \neducation, the TA will reflect in the project design the MOET\u2019s priority of producing employable \nworkers for modern manufacturing industries by teachers who (i) can introduce behavior and moral \neducation, (ii) have updated subject  knowledge at  the professional level, (iii) initiate knowledge \ntransfer through practice, and (iv) are equipped with teaching methodologies such as active-\nlearning method and use of information technologies.  \n \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2002.

The situational analysis; evaluation of design alternatives; impact assessments; specific \nplans to address issues related to resettlement, gender, minorities, and other dimensions; and the \nproposal presentation will follow ADB\u2019s guidelines.19 Based on the analysis, policy dialogue will be \nundertaken and specific proposals will be prepared for promoting equitable access to the upper \nsecondary and professional teacher development program for students from ethnic minority groups. \nThe TA will assist MOET in (i) processing its PFS and FS and following up the appraisal process in \naccordance with GAP methods and procedures; (ii) studying and compiling relevant regulations for \nimplementing the Project; (iii) training concerned staff on project implementation procedures and \nregulations of the Government as well as ADB; and (iv) carrying out other preparatory activities.20 \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented for 17 months, from October 2004 to February 2006. It will \nhave four  phases: In Phase 1 (weeks 1\u201313), situational survey will be completed; in  Phase 2 \n(weeks 14\u201332), a project proposal in ADB format will be prepared for discussion in the tripartite \nmeeting, and a PFS report approved by the Government;21 in Phase 3 (weeks 33\u201344) an FS report \nwill be completed and approved by the Government; 22 and in Phase 4 (45\u201368 weeks), MOET will \nbe helped to prepare itself for project implementation. \n \n12.  Each phase may include seminars and workshops in Hanoi for building a common project \nconcept and coordinating the interests of beneficiaries and relevant stakeholders. Phase 1 includes \nan inception (week 4) and  a midterm (week 13) seminar. The inception seminar will confirm the \nscope, approaches and methodologies, government procedures, and a timeline for processing the \nproject. The midterm seminar will discuss the findings of the situational analysis and understanding \nof the project concept and scope before a project proposal is drafted. Phase 2 includes a final \nseminar (week 29) followed by a tripartite meeting (week 31). The final seminar will present the \nproject following ADB guidelines, based on the PFS appraised by  the Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment (MPI). The tripartite meeting will confirm the project proposal in ADB format and the \nPFS. Phase 3 will not involve seminars. The FS will be submitted to ADB in English. Phase 4 will \ninclude informal workshops within MOET and the PMU to  carry out preparatory  activities for \nstarting the Project, including preparation of the implementation regulations and expenditure norms, \nPMU staff job descriptions and a recruiting plan, and  a  procurement plan with detailed cost \nestimates for the initial project year for review by the Ministry of Finance. Each  seminar and \nworkshop will prepare a report. ADB will monitor TA progress by a draft report before each seminar \nor workshop, and the report finalized after the seminar or workshop for quality control.23 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1 million equivalent, of which $583,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $417,000 equivalent  is the local currency cost (Appendix  3). The \nGovernment  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  $800,000  equivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign \nexchange cost and $217,000 of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nwith a portion amounting to $550,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding program, and $250,000 by grant \ncofinancing from the Government of Denmark to be administered by ADB.24 The Government will \n                                                 \n19  Relevant guidelines will be indicated in the outline terms of reference for consultants (Appendix 3). \n20  The TA will finance minor expenditures for necessary studies and workshops conducted by consultants or MOET; \nhowever, it does not intend to finance project implementation activities to be financed by the loan. \n21  Under the guidelines on ADB-funded project processing (GAP) harmonization procedures, Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment takes 12 weeks for appraisal, and the Government 4 weeks before issuing its decision to approve a project. \nDrafting project documents needs to be undertaken concurrently. \n22 Preparation of the feasibility study (FS) report should overlap with Phase 2. It will be drafted during weeks 21\u201328 and \nsubmitted to the Ministry of Planning and Investment for appraisal by week 28. \n23  The details of reporting are in Appendix 3.  \n24  Channel Financing Agreement between the Government of Denmark and Asian Development Bank, establishing the \nSecond Danish Cooperation Fund For Technical Assistance, 30 June 2003. \n ", "  5 \nfinance the remaining $200,000 equivalent of local currency cost, mainly through contributions in \nkind of office accommodation, counterpart staff, administrative and logistic support, and other \nrelated services. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance an ensuing Project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  MOET will be the Executing Agency for the TA. It will set up a PMU to guide, facilitate, \nmonitor, and assess the work of the consultants. The deputy director of Planning and Financing \nDepartment  will  be  the  project  manager.  The  deputy  directors  of  the  Secondary  Education \nDepartment and the Secondary Professional Education Department will be appointed as deputy \nproject managers. A project steering committee chaired by the vice minister of MOET will be \nestablished to coordinate the concerned government agencies for smooth processing of the PFS \nand FS. The committee will consist of representatives from MOET and ministries involved in the \nproject appraisal process.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented by six international and six domestic consultants, who will \nprovide 60 person-months of services:  20 international and 40 domestic. The consultants will be \nengaged through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection and a simplified technical proposal \nprocedure,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The international consultants \n(20) will consist of experts for (i) teacher training planning and administration (team leader, 10), (ii) \nteacher  training  curriculum  for  secondary  education  (1.5),  (iii)  teacher  training  curriculum  for \nsecondary professional education (1.5), (iv)  economics (5), (v) financial  analysis and  project \ncosting (1), and (vi) procurement (1). The domestic consultants (40) will consist of experts for (i) \nproject management and costing (15), (ii) teacher training curriculum for secondary education (5), \n(iii) teacher training curriculum for secondary professional education (5), (iv) social dimensions (7) \n(v) procurement and civil works (6); and (vi) information and communication technology for teacher \ntraining (2). Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4, together with reporting \nrequirements. The consultants will carry out all procurements following ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for \nProcurement. Office equipment procured under the TA will be turned over to the Executing Agency \nupon TA completion. \n \n16.  MOET  will  assign  to  each  international  consultant  a  counterpart  staff  to  (i)  assist  in \nobtaining  data  and  information,  liaising  with  concerned  agencies,  and  other  matters  for  TA \nimplementation; (ii) learn skills and knowledge of project design and implementation; and (iii) carry \nout preparatory actions for project implementation, during Phase 4. The counterpart staff will form a \ncore staff group in the PMU of the Project after the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Denmark, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  $550,000  on  a  grant  basis,  to  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  for \npreparing  the  Upper  Secondary  and  Professional  Teacher  Development  Project,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n     ", " 6  Appendix 1     \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK OF  \nENSUING UPPER SECONDARY AND PROFESSIONAL TEACHER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT \n \nPerformance  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  Risks \n       \nGoal       \n     \n\u2022 Upper secondary and  \u2022 Enrollment at upper secondary and  \u2022 Government \nprofessional education  professional education.  statistics \nstrengthened to provide  \u2022 Job placement rate of upper  \u2022 ADB statistics \ncapable human resource  secondary and professional school   \nfor national development.  graduates. \n   \nPurpose        \n       \nQualified upper secondary  \u2022 Shortage of teachers by subject,  \u2022 Semi-annual  \u2022 Linkage with the on-going and \nand professional teacher  grade, and school location.  loan review  new projects in education and \ndevelopment system    missions.  vocational training sector. \nestablished to support the  \u2022 Quarterly \nexpansion of upper  progress \nsecondary and professional  reports. \neducation anticipated in the  \u2022 Midterm and \nVietnamese Education  final reports. \nDevelopment Strategy \n2001\u20132010. \n \nOutputs       \n \nComponent 1.  \u2022 Number of teachers trained in  \u2022 Semi-annual  \u2022 Close linkage with the \nUpper secondary school  pre-service and in-service program  loan review  progress of on-going upper \nteacher training system  to meet the shortage of teachers.   missions.  secondary education \ndeveloped (Component 1).   \u2022 Composition of teacher training  \u2022 Quarterly  development project \n  enrollment \u2014ethnic minorities,  progress  maintained, particularly \n  gender balance, and student income  reports.  introduction of new curriculum \nComponent 2.  level.  \u2022 Midterm and  and associated in-service \nProfessional school teacher  \u2022 Internal efficiency of teacher training:  final reports.  teacher training program. \ntraining system developed.  drop-out, pass, and repetition rate.    \u2022 Performance should be \n  \u2022 External efficiency of teacher  measured primarily by \n  training: placement after completion  statistics i.e. facts and figures. \nComponent 3.  of teacher training and placement of  Narrative assessments may \nPolicy and institutional  professional school graduates who  be accepted for \nframework for sustainable   received training from teachers  supplementary purpose only. \nupper secondary and  trained under the new teacher  \u2022 Timely policy formulation. \nprofessional teacher  training system.  \u2022 The executing agency has \ndevelopment and  \u2022 Other parameters to measure the  adequate Implementation \nadministration established.  extent the project outputs satisfy or  capacity.  \n  has achieved (i) students\u2019 demand \nfor upper secondary and \nprofessional education; (ii) students\u2019 \ndemand for upper secondary and \nprofessional teacher training; (iii) \nmarket demand for employable \ngraduates; (iv) social, and \nenvironmental dimensions; and (v) \npolicy and institutional framework for \nupper secondary and professional \nteacher development and \nadministration. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \n   \nPerformance  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  Risks \nActivities       \n \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nThe provision of upper secondary education\u2014 including preservice teacher training\u2014 and professional education is \ngeared to reduce poverty in Viet Nam by promoting greater access to upper secondary preservice teacher training \nand professional education nationally and for females, especially those from poor and ethnic minority backgrounds. \nFor various cultural and economic reasons, the poor and ethnic minorities are underrepresented in upper secondary \npreservice teacher training and professional education. The upper secondary preservice teacher training focusing on \nupper secondary teaching job placement and professional education together with career orientation and training \nfocusing on local industry requirements thus provide students with skills to help them get jobs and overcome \ntransgenerational poverty. \n \nViet Nam's upper secondary education has expanded rapidly since 1993. From 1993 to 2002, upper secondary \nenrollment increased from 0.5 million to 2.6 million. The net enrollment rate (NER) increased from 7.2% in 1993 to \n41.8% in 2002.1 However, despite the remarkable increase in overall access to upper secondary education, the gap \nbetween the poor and the nonpoor is significant, especially at the upper secondary level. In 2002, the NER was only \n17.1% for upper secondary students from the lowest income quintile, and 67.2% for the highest.2 The low enrollment \nrates among the poor are due to geographic location of the upper secondary schools, direct private costs of \neducation, and the indirect (opportunity) costs of upper secondary education. Likewise, enrollments in upper \nsecondary preservice teacher training and professional education are underrepresented by the lower income \ngroups.  \n \nThe Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have signed a country poverty reduction partnership \nagreement, in which the Government has committed to reach the target of reducing poverty from 32% to 19% (or \nfrom 17% to 5%, as per the national poverty line), among others, by achieving the target of expanding upper \nsecondary education with the NER increasing to 50% by 2010. The Government has also committed to achieve the \nmillennium development target to increase the participation of girls and ethnic minorities beyond secondary \neducation.  Education, especially secondary education, affects productivity and contributes to improving the quality \nof the labor force, and increases human capital and, if equitable access is ensured, it can raise the incomes of the \npoor. Increasing equitable access to upper secondary education by improving its quality, efficiency, and relevance \nthrough preservice teacher training is a priority area for ADB support. \n \nThe Project will address issues concerning equitable access to upper secondary preservice teacher training and \nprofessional education. The provinces to be recommended for increasing equitable access are the disadvantaged \nprovinces in the North East, North West, North Central Coast, South Central Coast, Central Highlands, South East, \nand Mekong River Delta. Thus, the Project will address the gaps faced by the education sector in Viet Nam by \nproviding better school facilities in disadvantaged areas, and a support program for poor, ethnic minority students.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                        Proposed Poverty Classification \n   \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?   Poverty Intervention \n  Human development \nViet Nam has an overwhelmingly rural population (59 million in 2000). The  Gender and development \npopulation grew from just over 66 million in 1990 to slightly over 77.6 \nmillion  in  2000,3 or  an  increase  of  17.5%.  The  female  population \nincreased from 33.8 million to 49.5 million, and the male population from \n32.2 million to 38.2 million. The annual per capita income was D2 million \n($134) in 1994 and D3.5 million ($236) in 1999. 4 In the rural areas, the \nannual per capita income in 1994 was D1.7 million ($113), and D2.7 \n                                                 \n1 General Statistical Office (GSO). 1994.

However, stark differences exist between rural \nand  urban  areas,  and  between  the  lowest  and  highest  household \nquintiles. In 1999, the lowest income quintile of households had an annual \nper capita income of D1.2 million ($78); the highest, D10.4 million ($691). \nIn rural areas, the corresponding figures are D996,000 ($66) for the \nlowest income quintile and D6.3 million ($418) for the highest. In 1999, \nthe figures for the lowest income quintile in urban areas was D2.4 million \n($160), and for the highest, D23.5 million ($1,569). \n \nPoverty incidence is highest in the northern uplands, central highlands, \nand Mekong River Delta, and certain groups remain vulnerable. Most of \nthe poor (i) are farmers, (ii) are poorly educated, (iii) have many children, \n(iv) have little access to material resources such as land, and (v) have \nlittle  access  to  social  and  physical  infrastructure.  Two  groups  are \nparticularly vulnerable: ethnic minorities and unregistered migrants in \nurban areas. \n \nThe Government\u2019s achievements in reducing poverty are momentous. \nUrban poverty dropped from 25% in 1993 to 9% in 1998, and rural \npoverty, from 66% to 45%. Poverty largely affects the rural population and \nethnic minorities. Approximately 90% of the poor live in rural areas, where \npoverty  incidence  is  45%  compared  with  10\u201315%  in  urban  areas. \nAlthough poverty incidence has declined significantly, one third of the \ncountry\u2019s population remains poor. The increased private costs (tuition \nfees, uniforms, etc.) of education have reduced enrollment, particularly \namong the poor.  Ethnic minorities make up 28.5% of the poor but only \n14.2% of the population. Despite the Government\u2019s high priority on \npoverty  reduction  and  support  for  ethnic  minorities,  they  are \nunderrepresented in upper secondary education as well as in the upper \nsecondary preservice teacher training, especially the poor and females. \nLow income and consumption, and poor health bar these groups from \nupper secondary education.  \n \nPoor households lack access to productive farming land and adequate \ninfrastructure and education services. Ethnic minority households, and  \nsettlers who previously engaged in swidden agriculture then moved to \nurban areas are often excluded from mainstream economic activity. \nPhysical  and  social  exclusion  usually  results  in  a  transgenerational \npoverty cycle of poor living conditions, low productivity, and low income, \nlimiting access to education.  The project envisions the need to reduce \npoverty by removing barriers to exclusion; addressing the needs of the \npoor, ethnic minorities, and females; and providing the means to increase \nequitable access to upper secondary preservice teacher training and \nprofessional education.   \n \nIn-depth poverty and social analysis is needed to identify key difficulties \nand issues faced by the poor especially the poor and ethnic minorities \nliving in the poorest regions identified by the Government, namely the \nnorthern uplands, central highlands, and Mekong Delta. Based on the \npoverty and social analysis, a gender and ethnic minority education \nstrategy  will  be  developed  to  address  the  issues  and  to  guide \nimplementation of the project, focusing on the provision of targeted \nprograms  for  upper  secondary  preservice  teacher  training  and \nprofessional education. It is envisaged that at least 35% of the benefits \nwill accrue to the poor, and ethnic minorities, especially females. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?
