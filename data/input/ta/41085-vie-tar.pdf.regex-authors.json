Viet  Nam  formally  joined  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  January  2007. \nSubsequently,  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  developed  an  \u201cAfter  WTO\u201d  Action  Plan  for  high \neconomic  growth  and  sustainable  development.  The  action  plan  includes  preparation  for \nimplementation of WTO commitments and identifies domestic reforms to increase the benefits from \nWTO accession. The Ministry of  Finance (MOF) developed its action plan with the following \nobjectives  i)  ensuring  compliance  with  commitments  made  under  WTO,  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area, and other preferential trade arrangements \n(PTAs) with individual trading partners; and ii) strengthening capacity within MOF to formulate \npolicies to address challenges arising from increased international integration. The MOF\u2019s priorities \nfocus on addressing the effects greater international integration on state budget revenues and \neconomy-wide  impacts.  The  Government  requested  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nprovide advisory technical assistance (TA) to support selected components of the MOF\u2019s action \nplan. The TA follows on from small-scale TA provided to MOF in 2004 to support preparations for \nWTO accession. ADB fielded a fact-finding mission in November 2007 to discuss and reach an \nunderstanding with the Government about the objectives and scope of the proposed TA1, the terms \nof reference for consultants, and the cost and implementation arrangements. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s WTO Commitments. Viet Nam has agreed that the majority of agricultural and \nnon-agricultural goods can be imported with duties ranging from 0 to 35% (known as bound rates). \nDuties on some products will be reduced in a phased manner until 2014. The bound rates are legal \nceilings: Viet Nam can decide to apply lower rates. Products with higher ceilings include alcoholic \ndrinks, tobacco products, instant coffee, new and used motor vehicles and components, and roof \ntiles. Viet Nam has also agreed to comply with WTO rules on customs valuation, rules of origin, \npre-shipment  inspection,  anti-dumping,  safeguards,  subsidies,  and  trade-related  investment \nmeasures, but some of these provisions have a transition period. Tariff rate quotas2 are in place for \na limited number of agriculture products, and Viet Nam has agreed to gradually raise the quotas \nuntil they disappear according to agreed timetables. As part of its accession conditions, Viet Nam \nhas been classified as having non-market status, which permits trading partners to apply less \nstringent criteria for determining anti-dumping claims against Viet Nam\u2019s exports.  \n \n3.  Implementing Viet Nam\u2019s tariff binding commitments will reduce the average and \ndispersion  of  tariffs  (from  17.5%  currently  to  13.6%  by  2014).  This  reform  will  improve \nincentives for investment and resource utilization. However, compared with some countries, Viet \nNam does not seem to have taken the opportunity of accession to lock in a tariff regime more \nsuitable for an open trading economy. Some bound rates are higher than current applied rates, and \nmore than 50% of bindings are at rates of 20% or higher. The pattern of bindings seems to reflect a \nfairly typical trade negotiator\u2019s approach to tariff setting: most of the big cuts implied by the \nbindings seem to be in areas where the tariff is largely redundant\u2014i.e., where Viet Nam is a \nsuccessful exporter or where competition from imports is limited. The tariff cuts will reduce effective \nprotection across the traded goods element of the economy, but pockets of high protection will be \nallowed to persist if Viet Nam maintains rates at bound levels. This outcome has arisen partly \nbecause the Government has not developed procedures to ensure that it is taking a \"whole of \ngovernment\" approach to tariff policy formulation.3 \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 7 December 2007. \n2  Tariff rate quotas refer to import items that are subject to tariff rates on quantities exceeding the quota. \n3  The \u201cwhole of government\u2019\u2019 approach takes in account producers and consumers into consideration when formulating \npolicies.   \n ", "2   \n4.  The tariff cuts that will follow from implementation of bindings look set to reduce \ntariff revenues. Figure 1 provides three possible scenarios for the treatment of binding tariffs \nunder WTO accession. The base case assumes \"most favored nation\" tariff rates and exemptions \nfixed  at  2005  levels  (pre-WTO  accession).  Scenarios  2  to  4  make  assumptions  about  the \nimplementation  of  binding  tariff  rates  and  treatment  of  exemptions.  As  can  be  seen, \nimplementation of binding rates will lead to reduced tariff revenues, and only in scenario 4 will tariff \nrevenues recover to the pre-WTO trajectory, and this will take until 2018 or 2019. The Government \nalso  intends  to  negotiate  future  PTAs  with  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Japan,  and  possibly  the \nEuropean Union, and these arrangements will further lower tariff revenues and impact resource \nmobilization within the domestic economy. \n \n5.  Enhancing  tax  revenue  collections. Several countries have recovered lost trade tax \nrevenue by enhancing domestic revenue collection. Their experience suggests that: (i) revenue \nrecovery requires a committed effort to broaden tax bases by purging exemptions, simplifying the \ntax  structure,  and  improving  tax  administration;  (ii)  the  domestic  consumption  tax  system,  in \nparticular the value-added tax (VAT) and excises taxes, play a crucial role; (iii) income taxes can \nalso make an important contribution; and (iv) trade liberalization needs to be closely sequenced \nwith domestic tax reform. Scenario 4 indicates that a large part of this revenue loss could be made \nup  by  reducing  concessions  and  exemptions  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  customs \nadministration.  Shortfalls  could  also  be  made  up  by  adopting  a  different  approach  to  taxing \npetroleum products. More importantly, any assessment of the revenue effects needs to be carried \nout in a way that takes account of the broader range of changes affecting the revenue and \nexpenditure  system.  For  example,  economic  growth  should  expand  the  revenue  base,  and \nreductions in subsidies will reduce expenditures of subsidized commodities. \n \nFigure 1:  Non-petroleum import revenue scenarios \n3500 \nBase scenario Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4\n3000 \n2500 \nn \nmillio 2000 \n$  1500 \n1000 \n500 \n0 \n2005  2006 2007  2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  2019 \n \nData source: ADB staff calculations. Base scenario: no change in applied most favored nation tariffs from 2005 \nrates, and no change in the incidence of concessions and exemptions. Scenario 2: application of the tariff \nbindings, leaving applied rates that are below bindings unchanged. Scenario 3: application of the tariff to all \nbindings, including increasing rates where the bound rate is higher than the current applied rate. Scenario 4: as \nfor the second scenario, but with exemptions and concessions progressively reduced so that the difference \nbetween notional and actual revenue collections narrows progressively over time. \n \n6.  The Government has developed an action plan to address revenue shortfalls arising \nfrom WTO accession. MOF recognizes that several major taxes need to be updated to reflect \nchanges in the structure of the economy and national government budget, as well as changes in \ndevelopment  objectives.  The  Government  also  recognizes  that  the  new  challenges  to  its \n ", "  3\ncompetitiveness arising from improved market access will require reforms to key domestic policies, \nincluding tax policy and administration. In this context, MOF anticipates submitting to the National \nAssembly in May or June 2008 amendments to the laws on VAT and the corporate income tax. It \nalso anticipates submitting to the National Assembly amendments to laws on excise taxes, land \nand property taxes, and an environmental tax at the end of 2008 or 2009. MOF also recognizes \nthat remaining subsidies (e.g., investment incentives and land-use fees) affect both the national \nbudget and economic efficiency, and need to be reexamined. \n \n7.  The Ministry of Finance\u2019s action plan has also identified a need to build capacity in \ntax and trade policy formulation. In line with best international practices, MOF separated tax \npolicy formulation from tax administration in 2004. The Department of Tax Policy was established \nand  charged  with  analyzing  taxes  and  formulating  tax  policy.  MOF  is  also  responsible  for \nformulating tariff policy in coordination with key line ministries, including the Ministry of Trade and \nIndustry, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Planning and Investment. One lesson from Viet \nNam's WTO accession experience is the importance of developing a consultative process for trade \npolicy formulation that takes a \"whole of government\" approach. Viet Nam intends to negotiate \nadditional PTAs with key trading partners and it will be important that the Government carries out \neconomy-wide assessment of the proposed PTAs to ensure that they provide net benefits to Viet \nNam. In June 2006, MOF set up the Policy Advisory Group to provide independent and timely \neconomic policy advice to MOF on a wide range of economic policy issues, including taxes and \ntrade, and to assist with strengthening MOF's policy capacity. In this regard, MOF considers it \nnecessary  to  (i)  strengthen  its  own  capacity  to  assess  the  impact  of  WTO  and  other  PTA \nobligations, tax reforms, subsidies, and various economic policies on budget revenues, industries, \nand the economy; and (ii) build a mechanism for tariff policy consultation to inform PTA and other \ntrade negotiations in the short term, and trade policy formulation in the longer term. Long-term \ninstitutional  capacity  building  within  MOF  will  be  particularly  important  as  it  assumes  an \nincreasingly active role in setting a wide-range of policies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will support the Government by (i) providing timely policy analysis and advice on a \nbroad range of tax policies, (ii) strengthening MOF\u2019s capacity to assess and evaluate the impact of \nWTO commitments, other PTA commitments, and various economic policies on state budget \nrevenues, industries, and the economy; and (iii) support MOF to build a mechanism for trade policy \nconsultation  to  inform  PTA  and  other  trade  negotiations  in  the  short  term,  and  tariff  policy \nformulation in the longer term; and (iv) assess the impact of phasing out subsidies. \n \n9.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced tax revenue collections. The outcome of the TA will \nbe improved tax and trade policy formulation processes.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The key TA activities are divided into four components:  \n(i)  Component  1:  Tax  revenue  enhancement.  This  component  will  support  the \nDepartment of Tax Policy at MOF to improve domestic tax policies that enhance \nboth  revenue  and  economic  growth.  This  will  be  done  by  working  with  the \nDepartment of Tax Policy to provide: \n(a)  Technical papers on tax issues identified by the Department of Tax Policy. \n(b)  Workshops (public consultations) on selected tax policies.  \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Component 2: Strengthening capacity to carry out economic policy analysis. \nThis component will support MOF\u2019s ongoing efforts to strengthen its capacity and \nanalytical tools for assessing and evaluating the impact of WTO and other PTA \ncommitments, as well as the impact of other economic policies on budget revenues \nand the economy as a whole. This will be done by working with the Department for \nInternational Cooperation (DIC) at MOF to: \n(a)  Update  computable  general  equilibrium  models  to  assess  economy-wide \neffects  of  policy  changes  and  construct  a  revenue  forecasting  model  to \nassess the impact of WTO commitments and other PTA commitments on tax \nrevenues  over  the  medium  term;  and  update  other  statistical  tools  for \nassessing trade policy effects (continuing development of the \"effective rates \nof protection\" model,4 for example). \n(b)  Provide in-house training and workshops for technical staff from MOF and \nother relevant agencies in trade policy analysis, trade policy tools, statistical \npackages, and other issues identified by the Policy Advisory Group. \n(c)  Carry out an annual macroeconomic outlook report.  \n(iii)  Component 3: Mechanism for trade policy formulation and negotiations. This \ncomponent will support MOF and relevant line ministries to build a mechanism for \ntrade policy consultation to inform PTAs and other trade negotiations in the short \nterm,  and  tariff  policy  formulation  in  the  longer  term.  This  component  will  be \nintegrated with component 2 to ensure maximum synergy. This will be done by \nworking with the Department for International Cooperation (DIC) to: \n(a)  Explore  options  to  improve  the  institutional  process  for  tariff  policy \nconsultation  for  informing  PTAs,  drawing  on  best  international  practices \nadjusted to the Viet Nam environment. \n(b)  Utilize outputs under Component 2 [economy-wide approach].  \n(c)  Strengthen DIC capacity and staff skills for trade negotiations.5 \n(d)  Carry  out  economic  and  trade  assessment  of  selected  major  industries \nidentified by DIC. \n(iv)  Component 4: Assessing subsidies. This component will support DIC to:  \n(a)  assess the impact on the economy of phasing out current subsidies under \nWTO commitments, and  \n(b)  analyze  the  economic  effects  of  remaining  subsidies  (mainly  investment \nincentives and other incentives such as land-use fees). Consideration will be \ngiven  to  identifying  market-efficient  instruments  to  enhance  the \ncompetitiveness  of  the  economy  and  mitigate  any  negative  effects  from \nphasing out subsidies. \n \n11.  This  TA  project  complements  the  activities  of  ADB  and  other  development  partners, \nincluding Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the European Commission, \nUnited  Kingdom  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID),  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID), and the World Bank. AusAID and DFID has established the \n\u201cBeyond WTO\u201d trust fund to support the Office of Government coordinate implementation of Viet \nNam\u2019s  WTO  commitments.  USAID  is  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  WTO  legislative  agenda \nthrough the STARS project. The European Commission is supporting the Government\u2019s trade \npolicy agenda through the MUTRAP project, with a focus on product standards and fiscal policy \nthrough its Fiscal Policy and Legal Advisory Services Project. The World Bank is supporting the \n\u201cBeyond  WTO\u201d  trust  fund  with  TA,  and  is  supporting  customs  reforms  through  its  Customs \n                                                 \n4  Effective rates of protection are quantitative measures of the level of protection provided to a sector from import \ncompetition.  \n5  This activity will be supported by ADB's Office of Regional Economic Integration. \n ", "  5\nModernization  Project  and  Tax  Administration  Modernization  project,  which  focuses  on \ncomputerizing  systems  in  the  central  tax  office  and  regional  tax  offices.  Both  the  European \nCommission and the World Bank projects target modernization of customs and tax administration \noffices, within the framework of MOF\u2019s public financial management reform efforts. ADB  has \nworked closely with other development partners in preparing this TA project, and will continue to do \nso during implementation to ensure efficient use of resources. The Japan Fund for Public Policy \nTraining also provides capacity building activities to the MOF. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $360,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will provide in-kind contribution equivalent to \n$60,000 through the provision of counterpart staff, office space and utilities, administrative services, \nand physical facilities. Appendix 2 gives the details of cost estimates and the financing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency. MOF has been selected as the \nExecuting Agency based on its revenue mandate and its lead role in trade negotiations along with \nthe Ministry of Industry and Trade. Within MOF, the DIC will be responsible for implementing \nactivities under the TA project, as it is responsible for coordinating and implementing MOF\u2019s \u201cAfter \nWTO Action Plan\u201d. The TA project will be implemented over 18 months, starting February 2008 to \nJuly 2009. To facilitate advance disbursements for workshops, publications, and statistical software \nunder the three components will require the Advance Payment Facility (APF).  \n \n14.  A team of international consultants will be paired with national consultants to implement the \nTA activities. International and national consultants will be recruited by ADB on an individual basis \nto implement activities. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A total of 20 (7 international and 13 \nnational)  persons-months  will  be  required.  Five  international  consultants  and  five  national \nconsultants will be engaged to carry out the activities. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3. Procurement of equipment will be undertaken by consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Various workshops and in-\nhouse training programs will be held to encourage participatory discussions on tax issues and \nsubsidies and increase capacity of government staff and researchers. The ADB project team will \nlead the team of consultants. \n \n15.  The consultants will be responsible for providing reports and deliverables as required under \ntheir terms of references. The timing of each TA activity will be determined in consultation with \nMOF.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.
