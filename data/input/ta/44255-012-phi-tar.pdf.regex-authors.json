INTRODUCTION \n1.  The global financial crisis showed the Government of the Philippines that it had to \nstrengthen its supervision of the financial sector by working out long-standing weaknesses in \ngovernance and administration in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the \nInsurance Commission. A recent Financial Sector Assessment Program of the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) also brought out the need for a more developed capital market to reduce \nconcentration risk. The government has therefore made financial sector reform a priority and \ntaken  the  first  step  of  appointing  key  champions  of  reform  to  lead  the  nonbank  financial \nregulators.  Subprogram  2  of  the  Financial  Market  Regulation  and  Intermediation  Program \n(FMRIP-02)  reinforces  this  reform  effort  and  is  designed  to  deepen  the  financial  markets, \nbroaden the investor base, and strengthen policy and regulatory capabilities.1 Recent missions \nhave likewise noted a growing consistency between the government, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), and a wide range of stakeholders, including the private sector, in their identified \ndevelopment constraints and reform priorities.  \n \n2.  To build on this momentum for reform, the government has requested ADB technical \nassistance (TA) to support the implementation of policy actions agreed to under the Post \nProgram Partnership Framework (P3F) of FMRIP-02. The P3F calls for stronger collective \noversight  of  the  financial  markets  by  the  government  through  the  Financial  Sector  Forum \n(FSF).2 In addition, the government will implement the SEC\u2019s restructuring action plan. With the \nsupport of increased budget allocations, the TA will improve the operational capabilities and \nstrengthen prudential oversight by the SEC. Finally, the government will implement the priority \nrecommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program, particularly those that have a \nbearing on capital market development.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.  Poorly Coordinated Planning and Execution \n \n3.  Efforts to  develop  the Philippine  capital  markets  have  been  undermined  in  part  by \ninsufficiently comprehensive planning and direction, and by a lack of consensus. The previous \ncapital market development blueprint (2005\u20132010) was drawn up by the SEC, and participation \nin its drafting and implementation favored the SEC and the Philippine Stock Exchange, a \nSEC-regulated entity. The private sector contributed little to the plan, which turned out to be \noverly prescriptive. Only about 60% of its initiatives were completed. Many of the key cross-\nagency development constraints, such as taxation, a poorly developed primary and secondary \nmarket for government debt securities, the absence of a risk-free yield curve, and a lack of long-\nterm savings were not addressed. \n \n4.  To  deal  with  these  issues,  the  government  has  released  a  new  capital  market \ndevelopment plan (CMDP), which it is implementing through the Philippine Development Plan \nfor 2011\u20132016. With the CMDP, the government looks forward to easing key development \nconstraints by consolidating the government debt markets, developing a risk-free yield curve, \n                                                \n1 ADB.  2010.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  for \n \nSubprogram 2 to the Republic of the Philippines for the Financial Market Regulation and Intermediation Program. \nManila. \n2  The Financial Sector Forum is a nonjudicial college of regulators that coordinates financial sector supervision. It is \nnot empowered to issue regulations. Its members are the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (central bank), the Philippine \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Insurance Commission. \n ", "2   \n \naccelerating growth in the contractual savings industry, continuously developing the capacity of \nfinancial  regulators,  rationalizing  and  harmonizing  financial  sector  taxes,  and  improving \ninfrastructure (physical, legal, and governance, such as the credit information bureau, which is \ncurrently inactive). Legislative initiatives, such as the passage of the Personal Equity Retirement \nAccount (PERA)3 Act of 2008, complement these initiatives. These objectives are consistent \nwith  those  indicated  by  numerous  TA  projects  and  ADB-sponsored  diagnostics  within  the \nfinancial sector over the past 12 months.  \n \n5.  Implementing  the  CMDP,  however,  demands  close  coordination  and  collaboration \nbetween agencies like the Treasury, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank), \nthe Department of Finance (DOF), and the SEC, and the private sector. Shared goals must be \nestablished and mutually dependent responsibilities assigned. Disputes between stakeholders \nmust be carefully settled. Issues surrounding the primary and secondary government debt \nmarket must first be resolved to improve efficiency and pricing. The government can then push \nother reforms to remove barriers to stock listing and the flotation of corporate debt securities.4 \nConsultations have confirmed the distinct cost advantage of bank loans relative to securities \nwith their highly complex and costly process of issuance and distribution. At the same time, the \ngovernment will need to provide an enabling environment for long-term savings while ensuring \ngovernance reforms and adequate protection for small savers. \n \nB.  Weak Supervision, Reducing Investor Confidence \n \n6.  Despite  considerable  improvements  in  quality  and  coordination,  financial  sector \nsupervision continues to be hampered by weaknesses which dampen investor confidence. \nThere are three separate regulators: the BSP for the banking sector; the SEC for the nonbank \nsubsector; and the Insurance Commission for the insurance subsector. The FSF, formed in \n2004, has strengthened coordination. However, gaps in regulatory capacity and coverage, and \npoor enforcement of coordination arrangements have encouraged regulatory arbitrage among \nfinancial entities. Closing these gaps is a priority for the FSF, and it is expected to succeed \neventually in this goal. For now, however, supervision remains uneven. Immediate efforts must \nbe  made,  both  to  increase  capacity  and  to  set  the  stage  for  improved  cooperation  and \ninformation sharing. Better-coordinated approaches to supervision and regulation must be found \nfor  complex  financial  conglomerates  and  the  common  products  delivered  by  unaffiliated \nproviders across the financial subsectors. \n \n7.  The governance and operating weaknesses in the SEC and the Insurance Commission \nare due in large measure to a lack of fiscal and administrative autonomy. A limited budget and \ndemanding noncore functions have curbed the capacity of SEC staff to address higher-value \ncore functions. An inefficient corporate registration process is one particular consequence of \nbudget inadequacy. Routine corporate registrations, which have greatly increased in volume, \nare still processed manually and use paper-based routines. Resources have to be diverted from \nother departments, at times, to allow corporate registration renewals to be processed during \npeak periods.  \n \n8.  This processing burden has in turn delayed efforts to build and maintain an effective \nmarket surveillance and on-sight examination function. Market participants point out that the \nhigh costs of trading through the Philippine Dealing and Exchange Corporation, which is the \n                                                \n3 Personal equity retirement accounts allow individual Filipinos to save and invest on a tax-deferred basis to provide \nfor their retirement and will encourage long-term savings.  \n4  Corporate issuance is also constrained by tax and regulatory disincentives and a weak insolvency regime. \n ", "3 \nsole self-regulatory organization (SRO) for the bond market, evidences a need for stronger \nsupervisory oversight. Further, the 2010 corporate governance report from leading independent \nbrokerage and investment group CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets noted both anecdotal and more \nconcrete evidence of weaknesses in the SEC\u2019s oversight and supervision of market practices, \nincluding market integrity and financial reporting. 5 The lack of budget support compounds this \nproblem by compromising the SEC\u2019s ability to retain and develop staff that would allow it to \nprovide an enabling, financially stable environment for capital market development.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n9.  The proposed TA will address the foregoing issues through two main areas of focus: \n(i) improving  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to  facilitate  capital  market  development,  and \n(ii) strengthening  regulatory  capacity.  Efforts  to  encourage  the  development  of  the  capital \nmarkets will include recognized and specific activities to create an enabling environment. In \naddition, the assistance will sustain the government\u2019s renewed efforts to build consensus on \nspecific solutions to long-standing development constraints, across a varied stakeholder base. \nSuch collaboration is a prerequisite to solving the more technical issues mentioned in para. 4 \nabove and represents a continuation of ADB\u2019s engagement with the government over the past \n12 months. Activities to strengthen regulatory capacity will address the more pressing operating \nweaknesses as a prelude to establishing greater operating and fiscal autonomy in nonbank \nregulatory agencies, as envisioned in the P3F.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  TA  will  supplement  and  support  policy  actions  agreed  to  under  the  P3F  of \nFMRIP-02. Its impact will therefore mirror that of the FMRIP-02, which is an increase in the \ncontribution of the nonbank financial sector to economic growth. The outcome of the TA will be \na deeper, more diversified, and more resilient financial sector. To achieve this impact and \noutcome, incentives will be provided and barriers to capital market development will be removed. \nIn addition, the quality of regulatory oversight will be strengthened and investor confidence will \nincrease as a result. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology \n \n1.  Output 1: Improved Capacity for Capital Market Development  \n \n11.  The CMDP promotes higher economic growth and effective delivery of financial services \nthrough a stronger, more stable, more transparent, and deeper financial system. The activities \nin this component of the TA will assist in the development of a comprehensive, sector-wide \nimplementation  road  map  for  the  CMDP.  An  international  expert,  whose  services  will  be \nfinanced under the TA, will assist the Government to ensure that critical constraints are fully \nidentified and that proposed corrective actions are effective and addressed in proper sequence. \nMore  importantly,  advice  will  be  given  to  the  government  in  resolving  conflicts  between \nstakeholders.  \n \n12.  To provide an enabling environment for long-term savings and at the same time increase \nthe supply of capital market products, the TA will support the implementation of the PERA Act of \n2008, and provide for a comprehensive review and revision of the regulations for securities \nissuance and distribution. The resulting changes are expected to empower small savers while at \n                                                \n5  CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. 2010. Corporate Governance Watch 2010. Hong Kong, China.  \n ", "4   \n \nthe same time simplifying the issuance and distribution process for securities, thereby lessening \nthe relative cost advantage of bank loans.  \n \n13.  Finally, the TA will improve the investment climate by funding the development of a \ncorporate  governance  scorecard  linked  to  the  Maharlika  program  of  the  Philippine  Stock \nExchange. Corporations with good corporate governance will be eligible for expedited and \nsimplified processing of applications filed with the SEC. \n \n2.  Output 2: Stronger Regulatory Oversight and Enforcement in the Financial \nSector  \n \n14.  The activities in this component will improve inter-regulatory cooperation and reduce the \nopportunity  for  regulatory  arbitrage  by  backing  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  harmonize  the \nprudential supervision of private banking and wealth management beginning with a training \ncourse delivered simultaneously to all regulatory agencies through the FSF. By harmonizing \nknowledge,  the  FSF  can  then  serve  as  a  catalyst  for  the  development  of  synchronized \nregulations and supervisory processes by the individual regulators so that common financial \nproducts distributed by complex financial conglomerates or across financial subsectors are \nuniformly regulated.  \n \n15.  A policy action under FMRIP-02 called for the SEC to develop a restructuring action plan. \nUnder a second policy action, the Department of Budget and Management granted a significant \nbudget increase, totaling $9.8 million over 2 years, to the SEC to fund a permanent increase in \nstaff salaries as required under the revised Securities Regulation Code (2005), the hiring of \nadditional permanent staff, and the upgrading of the technical capabilities and infrastructure of \nthe SEC.6 The activities in this component will assist the SEC in achieving efficiency gains by \nproviding high level advisory support for streamlining and automating corporate registration, with \nthe allocated budget detailed above, which in turn will free up scarce resources within the SEC \nand enable the agency to focus on its core regulatory and supervisory duties. Ancillary benefits \nexpected from the automation project will take the form of greatly improved information about \nthe composition of the private sector corporate base in the Philippines for the use of economic \nplanners and other stakeholders.  \n \n16.  A  specific  budget  allocation  will  also  fund  the  purchase  of  improved  surveillance \nsystems, which, in combination with the TA activities in this component, will directly strengthen \nthe SEC\u2019s capacity to conduct market surveillance and to prosecute violations of the Securities \nRegulation Code. In addition, this component will strengthen the SEC\u2019s ability to supervise \ncollective investment schemes and SROs, and to ensure that financial reporting complies with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards to improve transparency.  \n \n17.  Lessons learned. The proposed TA incorporates the lessons learned from the 2003 \nADB country assistance program evaluation.7   Specifically, FMRIP-02 and the proposed TA  \nare  not  conditioned  on  the  passage  of  law,  as  the  legislative  process  in  the  country  is \ncumbersome  and  lengthy.  Further,  experience  has  shown  that  simply  changing  a  law  or \nregulation will not modify behavior without strong enforcement.  The proposed TA mirrors the \nstrong reform agenda of the government. Intensive consultations with industry stakeholders \nhave confirmed the wide acceptance and support that the reform agenda, in principle, enjoys \n                                                \n6 The budget increase is allocated as follows: $3.9 million for salary adjustments, $5.9 million for improvements in \nprocess and infrastructure. \n7 ADB. 2003. Country Assistance Program Evaluation: Philippines. Manila. \n ", "5 \namong stakeholders. The reform agenda is also consistent with the Philippine Development \nPlan and the CMDP, as well as with agency reform priorities. The TA in support of CMDP \nimplementation will reduce the risk that newer, more restrictive regulations are adopted. \n \n18.  Additional safeguards have been adopted in the form of three policy actions which serve \nas disbursement triggers in FMRIP-02. These triggers, which have been completed, ensure that \nthe proposed reform priorities will be adequately managed and funded. First, the transfer of the \nSEC back to the DOF provides for added guidance and ensures the alignment of the agency\u2019s \npriorities with those of the National Government. The acceptance of the SEC\u2019s action plan of \nrestructuring provided for common goals and a basis for budget negotiations with DBM. Finally, \nthe approval of the SEC\u2019s budget increase ensures funding is adequate to support the reform \nagenda. In addition, the recent appointment of new chairs to head the SEC and the Insurance \nCommission provide additional assurances that the DOF can exercise effective control over the \nnonbank regulatory agencies and the TA project. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.2 million, of which,  $1.0 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and office \naccommodation. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The executing agency will be the DOF. The BSP will serve as an implementing agency \nfor the PERA and FSF training program. The IC will serve as an implementing agency for the \ninsurance diagnostic and training program. The SEC will serve as an implementing agency for \nthe  balance  of  the  projects  contemplated  by  this  TA.  The  project  is  expected  to  start  on               \n2 January 2012 and end on 31 December 2013.  \n \n21.  ADB will hire consultants through quality- and cost-based selection (80:20), according to \nits Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). National experts \nwill be hired for implementation and capacity development in support of the launch of the PERA \n(output 1) and for the automation of SEC licensing and registration (output 2). International \nexperts will provide the remaining TA services (outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3). \nExpressions of interest solicited from qualified consulting firms will establish the appropriate \npackaging of the consulting services (one or several packages, depending on market testing). \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved               \nADB  administering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000                             \nto the Government of the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction for Capacity Development of Financial Regulators, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "6      Appendix 1   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nIncreased  Share of nonbank financial  AsianBondsOnline,  Global macroeconomic \ncontribution of the  subsector to reach 22% of  Datastream, World  conditions remain favorable \nnonbank financial  GDP by 2015 (baseline:   Economic Outlook  to business and credit \nsector to economic  20% of GDP in 2010)  database  expansion. \ngrowth     \n  The political situation remains \nstable. \n \nRisk \nGovernment reform priorities \ndissipate or change. \nOutcome      Assumption  \nA deeper, more  Total LCY bonds to reach  AsianBondsOnline   Credible implementation of \ndiversified, and  38% of GDP by  reforms under the program \nmore resilient  December 2013 (baseline:  translates into an increase in \nnonbank financial  35.4% of GDP in 2010)  investor confidence. \nsector   \n  Risk \nThe legislative and regulatory \nframework becomes more \nrestrictive.  \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
