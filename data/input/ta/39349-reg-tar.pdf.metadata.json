The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  through  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations  (ASEAN),  was  requested  to  provide  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  support  to \nenhance  cooperation  among  the  region\u2019s  equity  markets.  As  members  of  ASEAN,  Brunei \nDarussalam,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Philippines,  Singapore,  and  Thailand  are  committed  to \ngreater cross-border cooperation to promote fair and equitable access to capital in the region \n(hereinafter referred to as \u201cparticipating countries\u201d).1 The Project will build on ASEAN initiatives \nand related ADB TA in this area.  2 The Design and Monitoring Framework is set forth in \nAppendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The region\u2019s capacity to secure and sustain strong economic growth depends on access \nto  capital  by  regional  enterprises  through  well  functioning  capital  markets.  Well-developed \ncapital markets help reduce the overall cost of capital and dependency on bank financing. \nAccess to capital by medium-sized enterprises in the region is limited because of the small size \nof most equity markets, market fragmentation, and constraints to raising capital across borders. \nAlthough  the  savings  rate  in  most  participating  countries\u2019  economies  is  high,  financial \nintermediation is generally not efficient and capital tends to flow outside the region. Moreover, \nlarger  enterprises  in  participating  countries  often  raise  capital  outside  the  region.  Lack  of \neffective cooperation among participating countries\u2019 equity markets undermines the collective \nadvantages of the region and makes it more vulnerable to international market and policy \ndevelopments. 3     \n \n3.  With  the  exception  of  Singapore,  the  region\u2019s  equity  markets  operate  with  a  local \nemphasis.  There  are  significant  differences  in  legal  and  regulatory  regimes,  governance, \nopenness to competition, size, number of listed issuers, volume of trading, role of contractual \nsavings systems, extent of foreign listing, trading hours, and transaction costs. Total regional \nmarket capitalization of participating countries in 2004 was $616.5 billion, of which Singapore \n($218 billion), Malaysia ($182 billion) and Thailand ($115 billion) comprised the largest share. \nMore than $4.3 billion of new capital was raised through initial public offerings, half of which was \nin Singapore ($2.2 billion), followed by Thailand ($982 million) and Malaysia ($874 million).4   \n \n4.  National  governments  and  the  private  sector  in  participating  countries  have  taken \ninitiatives since the 1997 Asian financial crisis to broaden and deepen local capital markets. \nStock  exchanges  in  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  and  Singapore  have  been  converted  from \nmember-owned entities to for-profit corporations (demutualized), and are in the process of \nrestructuring their operations.5 Markets have integrated horizontally6 (Malaysia, Philippines, and \nSingapore)  and  vertically7  (Malaysia  and  Singapore)  to  operate  more  efficiently  and  have \nintroduced new products (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand). Singapore has become a \nregional financial hub and has actively sought greater cooperation, including linkages, with other \nregional (Malaysia) and international (Australia, Japan, and US) markets. While equity markets \n                                                 \n1  Notwithstanding the absence of an active equity market, Brunei Darussalam was included within the scope of the  \nassistance because of its potential role.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 October 2005.  \n3 Trading markets in Europe and United States are already linked electronically to enable greater cross-border   \ncapital raising and trading activity. Smaller emerging European markets are developing alliances and links to   \nensure sustainability.  \n4  World Federation of Exchanges 2004. Annual Statistics 2004.  \n5 The Government of Indonesia, through the submission of draft amendments to the Capital Markets Law, has a    \nstrategic plan to enable local stock exchanges to demutualize.  \n6  Horizontal integration refers to consolidation or merger of exchanges and/or adoption of common trading platforms. \n7  Vertical integration refers to integration of trading, central depository and clearing, and settlement systems. \n ", "2 \nin  Malaysia  and  Thailand  have  grown  significantly,  systemic  constraints\u2014including  poor \ngovernance  and  weak  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations,  and  concentrated  share \nownership\u2014continue to undermine the development of the Indonesian and Philippine markets. 8  \n \n5.  With respect to regulation, the Philippines and Singapore have significantly strengthened \ntheir legal and regulatory frameworks, and all participating countries have enhanced corporate \ngovernance, corporate disclosure and listing requirements. All capital market regulators in the \nparticipating countries are members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions \n(IOSCO) and have committed to full implementation of the IOSCO best practice principles and \nobjectives of securities regulation. Stock exchanges in Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand have \nupgraded their trading platforms for equities to promote market liquidity and enhance trading \nefficiency.  Stock  exchanges  in  Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Singapore  have  improved  their \nelectronic  surveillance  systems  to  provide  greater  transparency  of  trading  activities.  Stock \nmarkets  in  the  participating  countries  have  improved  electronic  information  dissemination, \nincluding website dissemination of trading data, and company disclosures (e.g., quarterly and \nannual reports). \n  \n6.  Through  ASEAN,  Southeast  Asian  countries  have  agreed  to  enhance  cross-border \ncollaboration among regional capital markets, which is one of the four areas of cooperation \nunder the ASEAN Roadmap for Financial and Monetary Integration, coordinated by a working \ncommittee on capital market development. The working committee aims to improve legal and \nregulatory cooperation and supervision through better coordination among regulatory authorities \nto address cross-border wrongdoing, detect unfair trading practices, and ensure fair treatment of \nshareholders  and  timely  disclosure  by  issuers.9  Singapore  is  a  signatory  to  an  IOSCO \nmultilateral memorandum of understanding that provides for sharing of information with other \nsignatories to support cross-border enforcement of securities wrongdoing. Other countries have \nentered into bilateral memoranda of understanding. Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia have \nformally  agreed  to  cooperate  with  each  other  with  respect  to  cross  border  enforcement. \nIndonesia and the Philippines reached a similar agreement.10  \n \n7.  ASEAN has formed a task force to explore regional trading and settlement alliances and \nlinkages and to remove regulatory and legal impediments to such linkages. ASEAN countries \nhave worked closely together with the FTSE Group11 to develop an FTSE/ASEAN index that \nshould promote cross-border equity products.   \n \n8.  Through  discussions  with  Brunei  Darussalam,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Philippines, \nSingapore, and Thailand under the framework of the regional country strategy and program, \nADB has been asked to provide TA to promote enhanced cooperation among regional equity \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Regional Strengthening of Asian Financial Markets, Regional Capital Markets \nReport. Manila (TA 5985-REG).   \n9  Consistent with their obligations as IOSCO members, regulators from the six participating countries have agreed to \nadopt the first 16 of the IOSCO principles of securities regulation. The first 13 principles promote (i) an independent \nand accountable regulator, (ii) clear and consistent regulatory processes, (iii) comprehensive inspection and \ninvestigation powers of regulators along with comprehensive enforcement powers, (iv) credible use of such \npowers, (v) authority of the regulator to share public and nonpublic information with domestic and foreign \ncounterparts,  (vi)  establishment  of  related  information  sharing  mechanisms,  and  (vii)  assistance  to  foreign \nregulators who need to make inquiries to discharge their regulatory functions. The remaining three principles \npromote (i) full, timely, and accurate disclosure of material information; (ii) fair and equitable treatment of \nshareholders; and (iii) high and internationally accepted accounting and auditing standards. \n10 Applicable laws and/or regulatory systems in the six participating countries generally do not provide a framework \nfor the sharing of both public and nonpublic information among regional regulators. The current legal frameworks in \nIndonesia and Philippines require amendment to enable full cooperation in this area. \n11 FTSE Group is an independent company whose sole business is the creation and management of indices and \nassociated data services. \n ", "         3 \nmarkets.12 The TA is expected to be a part of the Southeast Asia regional country strategy and \nprogram  which  is  currently  being  prepared.  It  will  complement  other  ADB  initiatives  and \nincorporates findings and lessons learned from ADB\u2019s work in capital markets in Southeast \nAsia, including related ADB loans, country specific TA, and regional TA, and other initiatives \n(See Appendix 2). The ASEAN Secretariat and the participating countries have agreed to \ncollaborate in designing and implementing the TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  TA  aims  to  support  the  development  of  Southeast  Asian  equity  markets.  The \noutcome of the Project will be better cooperation among equity markets through the adoption \nand  implementation  of  new  initiatives  and  action  plans  to  remove  legal,  regulatory,  and \nsupervisory constraints to cross-border capital raising and trading. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Based on earlier work to develop capital markets in participating countries, and through \ndialogue with key stakeholders, surveys will be undertaken to clarify the supply and demand for \nregional equity products and the cost of equity capital raising and trading. Reviews will be \nundertaken to clarify initiatives being undertaken by ASEAN, the IOSCO Asia Pacific Regional \nCommittee (APRC), and participating countries to address legal, regulatory and supervisory \nconstraints to cross-border equity flows and related investor protection concerns. The reviews \nwill identify gaps in current initiatives and make proposals that will complement ASEAN and \nAPRC initiatives and promote harmonization of legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks. \nThese will be discussed with key stakeholders and agreed to by the participating countries. The \ndesign  of  the  Project  will  be  flexible  so  it  can  respond  to  key  stakeholder  concerns  and \nproposals.13  Consultations  will  be  held  with  key  stakeholders,  particularly  with  ASEAN \ncommittees and task forces, APRC members, capital market regulators, and major market \nplayers.  \n \n11.  The Project will: \n \n(i)  assess supply and demand for regional equity products, including potential cross- \nborder investment products, and the cost of raising and trading equity products in \nparticipating countries; \n(ii)  review legal, regulatory and supervisory constraints to cross-border capital raising, \nand  trading  and  settlement  of  equity  products;  the  initiatives  that  have  been \nundertaken to address constraints; and make recommendations to fill any gaps; \n(iii)  review the status of enforcement frameworks, information-sharing agreements, and \nframeworks  for  investor  recourse  to  cross-border  dispute  resolution  and  make \nrecommendations to fill any gaps; and \n(iv)  evaluate  and  help  facilitate  the  adoption  of  new  initiatives  by  the  participating \ncountries  to  improve  cooperation  by  their  equity  markets  in  the  area  of  legal, \n                                                 \n12 During the IOSCO Asia-Pacific Regional Committee meeting in Bangkok (16 September 2005), ADB discussed the \nRETA proposal with securities market regulators from most of the participating countries. All participating countries \nwere sent copies of the draft TA and their comments were incorporated. ADB has been financing technical \nassistance through the Japan-ASEAN technical assistance fund to assist ASEAN countries to develop their bond \nmarkets under the Asian Bond Market Initiative. Assistance focuses on development of a general road map for a \nregional bond market, related country work programs, and capacity building in priority areas. \n13 Consultants implementing the TA will work closely with the chairs of related ASEAN committees and task forces to \navoid duplication.  \n ", "4 \nregulatory and supervisory frameworks, including proposals for potential ADB support \nfor such initiatives.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the \nentire  cost.14  However,  each  participating  country  is  expected  facilitate  the  collection  of \ninformation and data available within the government. The Project will be financed by ADB on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. It will cover the costs of engaging consultants and \npreparing reports. The Project will also finance regional workshops and seminars to disseminate \nits findings, gather views on the feasibility of its proposals, and facilitate agreement on new \ninitiatives and actions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  and will  administer  the  surveys, \nreviews, seminars, and workshops. Given that the Project will cover five countries under the \nSoutheast Asian Department (SERD) and one country under the Mekong Department (MKRD), \nit will be executed by SERD in close coordination with MKRD and the Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration (OREI). With the assistance of a team of consultants, ADB staff will work \nwith ASEAN working groups and task forces, APRC, capital market regulators in participating \ncountries, and other key stakeholders. The Project will be implemented over 10 months, from \nFebruary  2006  to  November  2006.  Consulting  services  will  consist  of  two  international \nconsultants (total 7.5 person-months): a regional capital market development expert will act as \nthe team leader on an intermittent basis (5 person-months) and a capital market legal and \nregulatory  expert  (2.5  person  months).  Domestic  consultants  (total  26  person-months)  will \ninclude (i) a capital market development policy expert and project administrator (7 person-\nmonths); (ii) a capital market statistical database expert (3 person-months) and country-specific \nexperts from the participating countries who will be engaged for a total of 16 person-months. \n \n14.  The consultants will be engaged on an individual basis by ADB in accordance with \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  team  leader  and  the  capital  market  legal  and \nregulatory expert will develop initial work plans that identify areas where local expertise is \nneeded.  They  will  help  prepare  draft  terms  of  reference  for  recruitment  of  the  domestic \nconsultants.  The  project  administrator  will  help  the  team  leader  and  ADB  coordinate  the \nactivities of the consultants, including organization of the workshops and seminars and the \ntimely submission of reports. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. \nAll procurement of equipment and materials, and service payments under the Project will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nSupporting Enhanced Cooperation among Southeast Asian Equity Markets, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.   \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2003.
