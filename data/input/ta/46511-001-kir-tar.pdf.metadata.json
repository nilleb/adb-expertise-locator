INTRODUCTION \n1.  In late 2012, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED) of Kiribati \nrequested  technical  assistance  (TA) from  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB) to  continue \nimplementation of the government\u2019s state-owned enterprise (SOE) road map, developed with \nADB assistance. The government\u2019s commitment to SOE reform is articulated in the Kiribati \nDevelopment Plan, 2012\u20132015 under key policy area 2: economic growth and poverty reduction. \nOne  of  the  strategies  identified  is  the  restructuring  of  underperforming  SOEs  to  enhance \neconomic  growth  and  improve  living  standards.  This  is  also  a  key  objective  of  Kiribati\u2019s \nstructural reform program, as contained in the joint policy matrix developed by the government \nand its development partners. Improving corporate governance and the commercial focus of \nSOEs is a key objective of ADB support identified in the country operations business plan, \n2014\u20132016 for Kiribati. This focus closely aligns with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, which recognizes \nthat in a microeconomy, such as Kiribati, poor expenditure allocation decisions have significant \nopportunity costs that impede development and growth.1 \n \n2.  The  28  July\u20131  August  2013  fact-finding  mission  resulted  in  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  with  the  government  outlining  the  agreed  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA to support the government\u2019s \nSOE  road map. The TA  will  be  provided  in  tandem  with  ongoing  SOE reforms,  including  \n(i) introduction of competition in telecommunications; (ii) implementation of a public\u2013private \npartnership for Otintaai Hotel; (iii) negotiations for a potential joint venture between a private \ncompany from Malaysia and  Betio Shipyard Limited; and (iv) ongoing support to Telecom \nServices Kiribati, Air Kiribati, and the Public Utilities Board. The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. 2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Kiribati exhibits most of the characteristics and constraints faced by small, vulnerable, \nand fragile countries. Remoteness, small economy, limited resources, and severe capacity \nconstraints limit its potential to achieve sustained economic growth and development.  The \nprevailing circumstances mean that the public sector accounts for most of the economy, while \nthe private sector is small, underdeveloped, and largely dependent on public sector spending. \nEffective public sector management is thus crucial to ensure that the country\u2019s limited resources \nare directed to where they are needed most. During 2007\u20132011, the budget deficit (usually \nfunded through the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund) ranged from 13% to 19% of gross \ndomestic product, with subsidies to SOEs contributing to the size of the deficit. In 2011, SOEs \nreceived government support equivalent to about 10% of gross domestic product. Despite the \nsupport, most SOEs pay no dividends to the government. \n \n4.  The 23 SOEs in the country share common weaknesses: (i) poor financial accounting \nand reporting with financial reports often years in arrears; (ii) lack of clear strategic or business \nplans;  (iii)  no  financial  budget,  or  budgets  that  are  overly  optimistic  and  unachievable;  \n(iv) nonpayment of interest or principal on government loans; (v) significant number of unpaid \ncreditors and substantial accounts receivable that will never be collected; and (vi) significant \ntrading  losses,  with  some  SOEs  technically  insolvent. While  ADB TA  has  helped  improve \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009. ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 September 2013.  \n ", "2   \ngovernance and financial reporting in some SOEs, more needs to be done to reduce the drain \non the government budget from underperforming SOEs.3  \n \n5.  Poor SOE performance can be attributed to two interrelated factors: \n \n(i)  Absence of a robust legal, governance, and monitoring framework. SOEs \nhave been operating without performance targets or accountability for results. No \nprofessional standards are in place for the appointment of directors. With no \nperformance contracts or statements of corporate intent, directors were not held \naccountable. In October 2012, the government enacted the SOE Act, which \nbecame  effective  on  1  August  2013.  The  act  includes  provisions  for  the \nestablishment of basic SOE director duties and obligations, accountability and \nreporting requirements, the roles and obligations of responsible ministers, SOE \ndirector performance reviews, limitation of the government\u2019s ability to provide \nfinancial support to SOEs, and establishment of an SOE monitoring unit (SOEMU) \nwithin the MFED. Implementation of the act will strengthen SOE governance, and \nimprove performance and monitoring. \n \n(ii)  Poorly  defined  mandates,  mixing  commercial  with  noncommercial \nactivities. In addition to weak governance frameworks, many SOEs do not have \nclear  mandates.  Many  are  required  to  deliver  community  service  obligations \n(CSOs) without consideration of the financial impacts on the SOE. To operate \nefficiently,  SOEs  should  have  very  clear  profit  objectives  and  transparent \nmechanisms to identify, contract, and finance any CSOs. Without these, SOEs \ncannot meet agreed performance targets, and the government cannot ensure \nthat it is getting value for money for the CSOs. The lack of a clear commercial \nmandate and of accountability for results are among the main drivers leading to \npoor SOE performance. \n \n6.  In 2008, ADB, with cofinancing from the Government of Australia, provided TA to the \nGovernment of Kiribati to begin the divestiture of its SOEs, starting with a local hardware trading \ncompany. Following the successful sale of this SOE, ADB assisted with the sale by competitive \ntender  of  a  wholesale  grocery  and  general  merchandise  trading  company.  The  TA  was \ninstrumental in helping the government establish an SOEMU, draft and facilitate the adoption of \nthe SOE Act, and develop an SOE reform road map.  \n \n7.  The capacity development TA will build on the success of the economic management \npublic sector TA, focusing solely on improving SOE performance. Improved SOE performance \nwill support economic growth and development. SOE reforms will minimize the fiscal burden of \ninefficient SOEs on the government\u2019s limited resources, allowing the government to better \nallocate resources to productive areas of the economy, including developing and maintaining \ninfrastructure and meeting social needs. \n \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Kiribati for Economic Management and Public Sector Reform. \nManila (TA 7166, $800,000, 13 November, with $1.5 million cofinancing from the Government of Australia). \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA impact will be a reduction of the financial demands of underperforming SOEs on \nthe government\u2019s fiscal resources. This will be measured by the decrease in fiscal transfers and \nbailouts to SOEs, and a reduction in SOE contingent liabilities. The outcome will be improved \nfinancial, operating, and governance performance of SOEs. By TA completion, the governance \nframework for SOEs, as established in the SOE Act, will be fully implemented and three SOEs \nwill have completed rationalization measures.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will complement ongoing reforms supported by various development partners by \nstrengthening SOE governance through implementation of the SOE Act, and by improving \ndirectors\u2019 performance through implementation of a performance evaluation system. The TA will \nhave three outputs: (i) rationalization strategies for three SOEs formulated and implemented, (ii) \nat least four training courses on SOE governance and monitoring delivered, (iii) performance \nevaluation system for SOE directors developed and implemented.  \n \n10.  Rationalization strategies for three SOEs formulated and implemented. The TA will \nassist the government in implementing its SOE reform road map. The government has identified \nthe Development Bank of Kiribati, Kiribati Ports Authority, Kiribati Insurance Corporation, and Air \nKiribati as potential SOEs for public\u2013private partnerships. The road map identifies opportunities \nfor SOE sales, contracting out, and mergers (such as Kiribati Copra Society and Kiribati Copra \nMill). The TA, through the SOE Reform Steering Committee (SRSC) will select three SOEs for \nwhich reforms will be prioritized and matched to available resources. The TA will work closely \nwith the ongoing subregional audit support program on the selection of SOEs to ensure that \naccounting and financial report preparation provided by the TA will be consistent. 4 \n11.  At least four training courses on SOE governance and monitoring delivered. The \nTA will focus on building the capacity of the SOEMU and the SOEs to improve processes, \nparticularly strengthening (i) financial management to help managers effectively manage, plan, \nand  monitor  performance,  and  (ii)  SOE  governance  and  accountability  through  the \nimplementation of formal annual processes established under the SOE Act. This output will \nbuild the capacity of the SOEMU and SOE directors and potential directors to  be able to \nundertake their roles and responsibilities under the act. The TA will review the roles of SOE \ndirectors  and  provide  training  to  establish  a  pool  of  potential  directors.  The  TA  will  help \nimplement the CSO policy through the development of costing methodology for CSOs and CSO \ncontracts between SOEs and the government.  \n \n12.  Performance evaluation system for SOE directors developed and implemented. \nThe TA will work with the SOEMU and shareholding ministries to develop (i) a selection and \nappointment  process  for  directors,  including  a  generic  position  description;  and  (ii)  a \nperformance evaluation system to monitor the performance of SOE directors. Shareholding \nministries will consult with the SOE boards of directors, the SOEMU, and responsible ministers \nbefore implementing the system. \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for the Pacific Regional Audit Initiative, Manila (TA 7794-REG). \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $880,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office \nsupplies,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in  \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  As the executing agency, MFED will appoint a TA focal point person to oversee activities \nof the consulting team and maintain the exchange of information. The consultants will, with the \nTA  focal  point  person,  liaise  with  relevant  development  partner  programs  and  projects  to \npromote coordination and complementarity of activities. To promote sustainability, the TA will \nuse the SRSC formed under the Economic Management and Public Sector Reform TA, chaired \nby  the  secretary  of  finance  and  comprising  officials  from  MFED,  the  line  ministries,  and \nrepresentatives  from  nongovernment  organizations  and  the  private  sector.  The  steering \ncommittee will promote broad-based commitment to the direction of reforms and guide TA \nimplementation.  \n \n15.  Lessons from previous assistance to MFED used in the TA design include (i) using a \nnational  committee  to  direct  TA  implementation;  (ii)  ensuring  that  consultant  missions  are \nundertaken  when  local  counterparts  are  in  the  country;  (iii)  using  a  good  local  facilitator;  \n(iv) focusing first on updating SOE financial accounts and land leasing arrangements; and  \n(v) stressing the importance of earning the government\u2019s trust and confidence. Based on these, \nthe TA will continue to rely on the SRSC to direct TA implementation. Given the importance of \nresolving land issues at the earliest possible time, a representative from the lands department \nwill be appointed to the SRSC. Due to the lack of qualified accountants in the country and to \navoid delays, the TA will engage an international SOE accounting specialist to update the \nfinancial accounts of three SOEs to enable the TA team to undertake due diligence of the best \nrationalization option for the selected SOEs. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented from 1 December 2013 to 31 December 2016. It is expected \nto finance 20 person-months of intermittent international consulting and 10 person-months of \nnational  consulting  services  (Appendix  3).  The  consultant  team  will  have  an  SOE  reform \nspecialist  and  team  leader  (10  person-months),  an  SOE  accounting  specialist  (3  person-\nmonths),  an  SOE  legal  specialist  (4  person-months),  and  a  capacity  building  specialist  (3 \nperson-months). A national SOE specialist (10 person-months) will assist the international team. \nInternational  consultants  will  be  senior  technical  specialists  in  their  field  with  extensive \nexperience in small island states. The consultants will be selected and engaged through a firm \nbased on a simplified technical proposal under the quality- and cost-based selection process, \nusing a 90:10 weighting for quality and cost. ADB will engage the consultants according to the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the \nTA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  The consultants will produce a concise inception report outlining the work program and \nmilestones for the duration of the TA, and a final report summarizing the achievements, issues, \nlessons, and next steps. Throughout the TA, the consultants will submit (by e-mail) brief monthly \nprogress reports summarizing TA activities, progress, issues, and constraints. The draft final \nreport will be submitted at least 5 weeks prior to the end of the assignment, and the final report \n ", "  5 \nwithin 2 weeks of receipt of government and ADB comments. \n \n18.  TA progress will be monitored using intended outcomes and outputs described in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). ADB will assist the government in providing all \nreports to the development partners. The reports will be disseminated through round-table \nmeetings, radio interviews, and the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof  Kiribati  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  for \nEnhancing Economic Competitiveness through State-Owned Enterprise Reform, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \n       \nImpact      Assumption \nReduction of financial  Fiscal transfers and  National budget  Government \ndemands of  bailouts to SOEs    commitment to \nunderperforming  decreased to 5% of GDP  International Monetary  implementing the SOE \nSOEs on the  by 2019  Fund Article IV staff  reform plan is \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal  (2011: 10% of GDP)  report  maintained. \nresources.        \nContingent liabilities  SOE financial  Risk \nreduced to 10% of GDP by  statements  Political instability \n2019   derails SOE reforms. \n(2010: 18% of GDP)   \n   \n   \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved financial,  Rates of return of  SOE financial  Reliable financial data \noperating, and  rationalized SOEs show  statements  for the selected SOEs \ngovernance  improving trenda    can be collected.  \nperformance of       \nSOEs.       \nCash flows for rationalized  SOEMU reports \nSOEs are positivea   \n   \n  SOEMU reports \nStatement of intent for all \nSOEs approved \n(2013: none) \n   \n   \nOutputs      Assumption \n       \n1.
