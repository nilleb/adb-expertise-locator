INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bangladesh asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ncapacity development technical assistance (TA) to support operationalizing the government\u2019s \nrecently adopted Policy and Strategy for Public\u2013Private Partnership 2010 (the public\u2013private \npartnership [PPP] guidelines) and a Bangladesh infrastructure finance fund (BIFF). In particular \nthe  government  is  seeking  support  for  two  critical  implementing  vehicles  under  the  PPP \nguidelines\u2014a public\u2013private partnership office (PPPO) within the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) \nand the Ministry of Finance PPP unit (MOF PPP unit) within the Ministry of Finance (MOF). ADB \nheld consultations with the government during the formative stages of these offices, permitting \nADB direct input to and understanding of the government\u2019s program for implementing the PPP \nguidelines.  \n \n2.  ADB fielded two consultation missions, during 9\u201314 June 2010 and 5\u20137 September \n2010,  and  a  fact-finding  mission  during  12\u201314  October  2010  to  discuss  the  details  and \nmodalities of the TA with the government. The mission issued aide-m\u00e9moire following the \nSeptember and October missions, detailing agreements with the government regarding the TA \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs and financing arrangements, \nand outline terms of reference.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The chronic  underdevelopment  of key  infrastructure  in  Bangladesh  slows  economic \ndevelopment and exacerbates unemployment, poverty, health, and public service issues. It \nnegatively impacts economic growth, taxing the Bangladesh economy. For instance, power \nshortages account for an annual estimated loss of 2% of gross domestic product, and operating \ndeficits within the utility sector account for another 1%.2   \n \n4.  The  country  has  traditionally  relied  upon  the  public  sector  to  develop,  deliver,  and \nmaintain infrastructure.3 However, inconsistent project design, poor project implementation and \nmanagement, and allegations of corruption, compounded by chronic shortage of funding, all \nresult in poor services. Tariff rates, and tax and nontax fee support is uniformly below the cost of \nservice across all infrastructure sectors. While the government has sought to increase the \ninvolvement and number of private sector participants in infrastructure, these factors signal \ncaution for such endeavors.   \n \n5.  Investors\u2019 perceptions of Bangladesh are undermined by a general lack of transparency \nand accusations of corruption. The country ranked 134th on Transparency International\u2019s 2010 \nranking for corruption4 and 107th on the World Bank\u2019s annual index for ease of doing business. \nMost notably, Bangladesh ranks 172nd for ease of registering property and 179th out of 183 \ncountries  in  ability  to  enforce  contracts.5 These  rankings,  while  they  may  not  be  directly \napplicable  or  relevant  in  the  specific  realm  of  PPP-related  transactions,  do  contribute  to \nnegative perceptions outside the country.    \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 November 2010. \n2  World Bank. 2008. Harnessing competitiveness for stronger inclusive growth: Bangladesh Second Investment \nClimate Assessment. Bangladesh Development Series. No. 25. Washington, DC. \n3  According to the World Bank\u2019s Public-private Infrastructure Advisory Facility database, during 1990\u20132008, only 26 \nprivate infrastructure projects were reported, of which 12 were in the lucrative telecommunications sector and \nrepresent more than 80% of all infrastructure sector investment. See http://ppi.worldbank.org/.  \n4  Transparency International. 2010. Corruption Perceptions Index 2010. Berlin. The index assesses 179 countries.  \n5  World Bank. 2010. Doing Business, 2011: Making a difference for entrepreneurs. Washington, DC. \n ", "2   \n \n6.  Bangladesh\u2019s PPP infrastructure development program has not delivered a significant \nvolume of needed projects, and poor procurement performance has held back expanded use of \nthis investment modality. Government entities have tended to take an ad hoc approach to PPP \nprojects. As a result, bidding processes have suffered from lack of proper preparation by the \npublic sector entities managing procurement, lack of ownership within implementing government \nbodies, frequent changes of project management, inconsistent bidding processes, skewed risk \nallocations in bid documents, and allegations that established procurement standards were not \nfollowed. Such empirical evidence serves to undermine confidence in government solicitation \nprocesses and results in driving value-added infrastructure participants away from the market. A \nrevised approach to development, bidding, and management of PPP infrastructure is required to \ncreate a robust and dependable approach to privately invested infrastructure development and \nto regain stakeholder confidence.   \n \n7.  In 2010, the government sought to address the identified weakness in its infrastructure \ndevelopment program by making PPP a national priority through a series of policy and support \nmeasures: \n(i)  adoption of the PPP guidelines6 governing PPP infrastructure development and \nprocurement for small, medium-sized, and large project activities (August 2010); \n(ii)  the decision to establish a PPP office within the PMO (September 2010);7 \n(iii)  design  of  the  BIFF to provide  cofinancing to PPP  infrastructure  investments \n(June 2010); and \n(iv)  significant and definitive budget allocations in the FY2011 budget to support \nthese activities: Tk16 billion for the BIFF (June 2010) and Tk30 billion for PPP \nproject development and coinvestment (June 2010), including establishment of a \nPPP technical assistance fund (PPPTAF) and provision for viability gap funding. \n   \n8.  To support implementation of these elements of the PPP program, the government \nasked  ADB  to  provide  TA  support  for  comprehensive,  holistic  assistance  across  key \ngovernment ministries and to help the government develop and implement the policies and \nprocedures needed to operationalize the PPP program. The TA support will create a robust, \nsustainable, and transparent framework for attracting and procuring private sector involvement \nand investment in critical infrastructure under the PPP guidelines by \n(i)  developing a credible, robust, and fundamentals-driven PPP project identification, \npreliminary project development, tendering, and negotiating process;  \n(ii)  promoting  strong  professional  oversight  and  management  of  PPP  project \ndevelopment, bidding, and implementation processes within government on a \nsustainable basis; and \n(iii)  developing capabilities within government in general and MOF specifically for \nproviding close oversight of fiscal and economic impacts of PPP projects within \ngovernment supported by explicit budgeting, provisioning, and risk management \nof  subsidies  and  contingent  liabilities  associated  with  or  arising  from  PPP \nprojects. \n \n                                                \n6  The  policy,  published  in  the  Gazette of  Bangladesh,  comprises  the  Policy  and  Strategy  for  Public\u2013Private \nPartnership, 2010; Guidelines for Formation, Appraisal and Approval of Large Projects, 2010; Guidelines for \nFormation, Appraisal and Approval of Medium Projects, 2010; and Guidelines for Formation, Appraisal and \nApproval of Small Projects, 2010. The prior governing policy, Bangladesh Private Sector Infrastructure Guidelines, \n2004 stands rescinded and replaced by the current policy, with provisions for grandfathering activities completed \nunder the former policy.   \n7  Minutes for the meeting of implementation of Budget 2010/11 of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, 31 August 2010. \n ", "  3 \n9.  By operationalizing the government\u2019s new PPP guidelines, the TA seeks to put in place \nthe  self-sustaining  institutions  and  operations  that  will  address  past  shortcomings  in  PPP \ninfrastructure  development,  promote  greater  development  efficiency  of  such  projects,  and \nfacilitate the broader delivery of PPP infrastructure in Bangladesh.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be improved ability within the government to identify, structure, \ntender,  and  close  on  privately  invested  and/or  owned  and  operated  infrastructure  and \ninfrastructure services within the next 24 months. To achieve this impact, the outcome of the TA \nwill be the delivery of an operating PPPO and MOF PPP unit within government, with the staff, \npolicies,  and  operating  procedures  to  identify,  structure,  bid  out,  and  implement  PPP \ninfrastructure in Bangladesh.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  will  support  the  establishment  of  the  organizations  envisioned  in  the  PPP \nguidelines and required by government to oversee and drive implementation of the institutional \nprocesses  nationally.  These  organizations  will  operate  using  the  institutional  implementing \ndocumentation,  processes,  and  procedures  to  facilitate  and  sustain  PPP  infrastructure \ndevelopment created by the TA.   \n \n12.  Organizational  development. The  implementation  of two  key  organizations  will  be \nfacilitated under the TA: \n(i)   Public-private partnership office. The PPPO will be a professionally staffed, \nself-sufficient PPP office placed within the PMO. It will be tasked with providing \nlifecycle  support  to  PPP  infrastructure  projects  by  (a)  screening  candidate \nprojects promoted by line ministries for PPP eligibility; (b) undertaking preliminary \ndevelopment  of  qualifying  PPP  projects  to  prepare  them  for  international \ncompetitive bidding; (c) developing, implementing, and managing the bidding and \nprocurement process through tendering, evaluation, and selection; (d) leading \nnegotiations with successful bidders on behalf of line ministries and supporting \nprojects  in  achieving financial  close; (e)  identifying  and  retaining  a group  of \nprofessional  advisers  to  support  the  project  development,  bidding,  and \nnegotiations process readily accessible to PPPO staff; and (f) providing project \nimplementation monitoring, oversight, and, if necessary, support for arbitration, \nthrough  construction  and  into  operations  to  assure  compliance  with  agreed \nconcession arrangements. \n(ii)  Ministry of Finance public-private partnership unit. The unit will be a PPP \nfiscal  oversight  office  within  MOF,  charged  with  (a)  assessing  the  financial \nviability  of  PPP  projects  proposed  by  the  PPPO;  (b)  approving  access  to  a \ngovernment-sponsored PPPTAF and viability gap funding to support preliminary \nproject  development  under  the  auspices  of  the  PPPO;  and  (c)  quantifying, \nforecasting, and managing risk exposure incurred by the government under PPP \ninfrastructure.   \n \n13.  The TA will create a communications strategy for the PPP program in Bangladesh, \nfacilitating integration of line ministries into the PPPO and facilitating the dissemination of the \n ", "4   \nnew PPP guidelines to stakeholders. The TA will also specify web-enabled processing and \ncommunication  tools  for  the  PPPO  and  government  in  relation  to  PPP  and  specify  a \nmanagement information system linking PPP development activities with the MOF PPP unit.  \n \n14.  Institutional development. Institutional arrangements will be developed to define and \nguide  the  specific  work  to  be  conducted  by  the  PPPO  and  MOF  PPP  unit.  Institutional \narrangements will require the development of a manual for the PPPO with processes and \nprotocols  for  PPP  project  screening  and  selection,  project  development,  and  financial \nassessment.  The  manual  will  include  bidding  and  contracting  principles,  processes,  and \nmodalities for PPP projects, including a form of master concession agreement for use by the \nPPPO. The TA will seek adoption of streamlined project development, bidding, negotiation, \nclosing, and monitoring processes for private sector participation in infrastructure across all \nrelevant ministries. It will identify a shortlist of initial candidate ministries to be integrated with \nthe new PPP operating procedures developed under the TA. To assure PPP infrastructure \nprojects can be implemented within Bangladesh as envisioned by the government, an inventory \nand  assessment  of  existing  Bangladesh  laws,  policies,  and  regulations  impacting  PPP \nimplementation  will  be  compiled,  identifying  any  gaps  and  providing  recommendations  for \nrevisions. The project development and bidding processes within the PPPO will integrate ADB\u2019s \nlatest environmental and social safeguard protocols and incorporate anticorruption and integrity \nprotections.   \n \n15.  Oversight, coordination, and management. To assure that the TA is implemented on \nschedule and budget, a project steering committee will be formed in the PMO. The PMO\u2019s \nprincipal secretary will serve as the chair with the ADB PPP team leader as member and \nconvener. The project steering committee will coordinate the efforts of the PMO, MOF, and line \nministries in implementing the PPP guidelines. The TA team will provide reports on the progress \nof implementation with recommendations for future implementation works. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The government will finance the \nbalance of $200,000 through the provision of office space, remuneration of counterpart staff, \nand provision of local services during TA implementation. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The PMO will be the executing agency for the TA. The PPPO and MOF will be the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  project  steering  committee  will  comprise  members  of  the \nimplementing agencies, key government officials (to be identified, but with representation from \nkey members of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs), the TA project manager, and the \nlead ADB PPP professional staff who will serve as member and convener of the committee \n(para. 15). The committee will meet monthly to review progress and discuss issues arising from \nthe work performed under the TA.   \n \n18.  The government will provide office space and supporting staff for the PPPO and MOF \nPPP  unit,  and  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  operating  expenses  of  these  units.  Upon \nconfirmation of the PPPO organization chart, it is anticipated additional government funding will \nbe released to cover staffing costs. The goal is to meet government budgeting requirements for \napproving funding for the PPPO to enable it to hire professional private sector staff to run  \nproject  related  operations,  augmented  by  allocated civil  servants  to  oversee  administrative \n ", "  5 \noperations and compliance. The MOF PPP unit will be staffed by appointments within MOF and \nwill be trained by the TA project team. A director and two officers from the PMO have been \nidentified to oversee PPPO implementation. MOF has also identified its oversight resources.   \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented from January 2011 to June 2011. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants is provided in Appendix 3. International expertise (four consultants,  \n21 person-months) will be required in the areas of PPP commercial and/or financial advisory, \nlegal,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  safeguards.  The  national  consultants  (five  for  \n23 person-months) will have expertise in finance, infrastructure policy, legal, and information \ntechnology. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made \nin accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n20.  The processes, frameworks, and criteria will be packaged as public documents and \ndisseminated via focus groups, workshops, and a web-based portal under the PPPO, all within \nBangladesh. The TA will seek to catalyze a comprehensive communications strategy for the \ngovernment and the PPPO. ADB will compile case studies on past and current PPP projects in \nBangladesh and the process of the government\u2019s PPP program evolution for presentation via \nthe PPP practice group and via internal ADB forums, presentations, workshops, white papers, \nand PPP-related symposia. \n \nIV.
