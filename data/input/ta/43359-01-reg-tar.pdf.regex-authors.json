INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has long supported financial sector development in \nits developing member countries in Central and West Asia.1 This support has focused on \nimproving  the  sector\u2019s  institutional,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework,  through  technical \nassistance,  program  loans,  and  other  lending  modalities.2The  global  financial  crisis  has \ndemonstrated the growing relevance of and demand for3 ADB assistance in the area of advisory \nsupport, training, and access to credit to support economic growth.4 The proposed regional \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant of $1.5 million has been designed to respond to these needs. \nThe TA aims to increase the impact and outcomes of ADB financial sector operations in Central \nand West Asian countries. It will incorporate lessons learned in providing access to finance and \ndevelop a better understanding of credit demand, supply, and constraints in the Central and \nWest Asian countries. It will also address common issues, stakeholder priorities, crosscutting \ntraining needs, synergies with other ADB operations, and targets for ADB support. This will be \naccomplished through two components. The first will (i) undertake financial sector assessments \nand surveys, (ii) prepare crosscutting regional knowledge products and working papers, and (iii) \nprepare product-focused action plans based on country demand. The second component will \ndeliver training and capacity building programs. The TA is expected to begin in January 2011 \nand be completed by December 2013. The design and monitoring framework (DMF) is in \nAppendix 1 and the terms of reference for consultancy services are in Appendix 3.5  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The global financial and economic crisis had a substantial impact on Central and West \nAsian countries. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and foreign direct investment (FDI) \nnet inflows decreased significantly throughout the region in 2009 (Appendix 4, Tables A4.2, \nA4.3). Growth in outstanding commercial loans contracted (Appendix 4, Table A4.4). The crisis \nhighlighted risks associated with excessive reliance on funding in foreign currency, asset-to-\nliability  maturity  mismatch,  poor  risk  management  practices  by  financial  institutions,  and \nineffective regulation and supervision by financial sector regulators. \n \n                                                 \n1 The countries covered by ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) are Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n2 While most technical assistance programs and program loan operations have been viewed as successful, only \nabout half of credit line operations have been rated successful or better (ADB. 2008. Support for Financial \nIntermediation in Developing Member Countries. Special Evaluation Study Update. Manila).  \n3 Informal discussions have been held with government agencies and key stakeholders in Central and West Asian \ncountries,  including  ministries  of  finance,  central  banks,  and  regulatory  authorities,  and  other  international \ninstitutions and private sector financial institutions in Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Formal supporting documentation is being sought via resident missions. \n4  For example, banks in Kazakhstan were unable to access the international interbank and bond markets after the \nglobal financial crisis, which impacted the liquidity of Kazakh banks, resulted in a decline in the availability of \ndomestic credit for investment and expansion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and created a debt \ncrisis. In 2010, ADB provided a multitranche financing facility (MFF) of $500 million to provide longer-term local \ncurrency finance for SMEs through the banking sector (ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Small and Medium Enterprise \nInvestment Program. Manila [MFF 0048 for $500 million, approved on 29 September 2010]).  \n5  The TA for Financial Sector Development in Central and West Asia was not included in the regional cooperation \nstrategy or regional cooperation operations business plan. The concept paper was approved by the vice-president \nfor operations 1 on 12 November 2010. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 23 November 2010.  \n ", "2  \n3.  Lessons from previous ADB financial sector operations need to be applied in the design \nof future financial sector support. Previous support for reforms\u2014in Pakistan, for example\u2014\nfocused on an institutional rather than functional approach to financial sector development and \ndid not reflect ongoing conglomeration in the industry, regulatory arbitrage, and related risks, all \nof which emerged as major concerns and lessons learned during the global financial crisis.6 In \nthe nonbank financial sector, development support often did not effectively address issues of \neconomies of scale and related capacity constraints in the region\u2019s smaller economies (e.g., the \nKyrgyz Republic). Previous efforts also failed to link such support to real sector demand for \ncredit or take advantage of new, more flexible ADB lending and nonlending products, including \nlocal currency loans and guarantees, that could help mobilize international and domestic credit. \nThus, while financial sector reforms have translated into laws and regulations that promote best \npractices, they often have not led to greater access for borrowers to the right type of credit (in \nterms of tenor, currency and interest rate base), credit that is fairly priced to reflect risk following \nsound market principles, or to increased opportunities for savers and investors to extend such \ncredit. \n \n4.  Access to finance remains a barrier to sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the \nregion. Access to finance in Central and West Asian countries is generally ranked as either the \nmost important or one of the most important obstacles to doing business. Lack of financial \nmarket development\u2014which is evident from several indicators in recent international reports7\u2014\nis considered a significant competitive disadvantage. The indicator on \u201cgetting credit,\u201d which \nmeasures the degree to which collateral and bankruptcy laws facilitate lending, shows that most \nof  the  region\u2019s  countries  operate  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  in  conducting  business \n(Appendix  4,  Table  A4.1).  In  addition,  although  the  region\u2019s  financial  sectors  are  largely \ndominated by banks, the penetration of most banking systems is low. Afghanistan had only 0.4 \ncommercial banks and 0.1 ATM machines per 1,000 square kilometers in 2009 (Appendix 4, \nTables A4.5, A4.6). The level of development of the countries\u2019 capital markets vary but the \nmarkets remain small. Stock market capitalization is only 1.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) \nin Armenia and the Kyrgyz Republic (Appendix 4, Table A4.9). The ratio of debt securities to \noutstanding bank loans is merely 0.3% in Pakistan and 0.5% in Azerbaijan (Appendix 4, Table \nA4.11). Many of the policy, legal, and regulatory issues that have constrained capital market \ndevelopment in the  Central and West Asian countries can be addressed by governments and \nregulatory bodies. \n \n5.  Infrastructure,  institutional,  and  regulatory  distortions  undermine  financial  sector \ndevelopment.  Building  and  strengthening  financial  infrastructure  and  increasing  access  to \nfinance are high on the development agenda for Central and West Asian countries. Despite their \ndiffering stages of financial sector development, the common emphasis across the region has \ngenerally been on developing the banking sector, creating wholesale payments systems, and \nadopting and implementing accounting and auditing rules for large firms. Progress has been \nsignificant  but  the  distortions  that  remain  impede  the  sector\u2019s  growth.  In  addition  to \nunderdeveloped finance infrastructure, loan portfolios are often concentrated in a few sectors. \nThe role of the non-bank sector is limited. Opportunities for long-term savings remain limited \nand are often viewed as risky. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have limited access \nto finance. Legal enforcement, governance, and transparency are often weak. In addition, the \nglobal  financial  crisis  has  resulted  in  renewed  discussions  on  best  practices  and  their \n                                                 \n6 ADB.  2009.

These challenges and their implications need to be \nbetter understood. \n \n6.  Lack of capacity limits the opportunities for the governments in the region to facilitate \ngreater access to finance. Financial sector supervisors, regulators, and policy makers can \npotentially play an important role in addressing financial sector challenges in the Central and \nWest Asian countries. They can promote policies that help the market develop while maintaining \nconsumer  confidence  through  effective  regulation  and  supervision.  However,  the  region\u2019s \nfinancial sector supervisors and regulators for both banks and nonbank institutions sometimes \nlack the knowledge, skills, and experience needed to respond to sector developments and \nchallenges or to promote changes that will provide greater access to finance. They may also \nlack expertise in regulating such financial institutions as insurance companies and microfinance \ninstitutions  or  equity  and  security  financial  markets.  Budgetary  constraints  often  make  it \nimpossible to fill these capacity gaps through training for bank and non-bank regulators and \nsupervisors or exposure to best practices in other jurisdictions facing similar challenges. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be to improve the enabling environment for financial sector \ndevelopment in the region. Indicators will track factors of financial development, including (i) \nease of access to loans, (ii) quality of regulation of securities exchanges, (iii) availability of \nfinancing through local equity markets, and (iv) soundness of banks. The expected outcome of \nthe TA will be the application of an improved design for institutional, policy, and regulatory \nmeasures that address identified critical constraints to financial sector development and that \ncontribute to enhancing the quality of future ADB financial sector interventions in Central and \nWest Asian countries. Performance will target the endorsement of financial sector action plans. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will have four outputs delivered through two components. The outputs of the first \ncomponent  will  be  (i)  financial  sector  assessments  and  surveys\u2014including  identification  of \nconstraints to financial sector development, (ii) preparation of crosscutting knowledge products \nand working papers, and (iii) preparation of product-focused action plans based on country \ndemand. The output of the second component will be training and capacity-building programs. \n \n1.  Survey  and  Assess  Constraints  to  Financial  Sector  Development  and \nIdentify Training Needs  \n9.  The TA will support the preparation of surveys that assess demand and supply of \nfinancial products and services in Central and West Asian countries, and constraints thereto. \nThe surveys will identify capacity gaps and training needs and areas where further analysis or \nresearch is needed. An initial desk review will identify and assess (i) TA programs and loans to \nCentral  and  West  Asian  countries,  (ii)  training  programs  provided  by  ADB  and  by  other \ninstitutions and training providers (both local and international), and (iii) other relevant material. \nIt will be followed by a visit to each country to meet with key stakeholders\u2014including regulatory \nand supervisory authorities and private sector participants\u2014to validate the desk review findings \nand clarify impediments to financial sector growth, including capacity gaps. Based on these \nassessments,  several  regional  or  subregional  training  programs  and  seminars  targeted  at \n ", "4  \nCentral  and  West  Asian  financial  sector  supervisors  and  regulators  will  be  developed  in \ncoordination with respective stakeholders. In-country training programs will also be identified for \nfurther support. In addition, as part of the surveys, crosscutting constraints to effective financial \nintermediation will be identified for further in-depth research and analysis.  \n \n2.  Prepare  and  Disseminate  Research  and  Policy  Recommendations  on \nFinancial Sector Development  \n10.  The TA will support working papers and knowledge products to reflect crosscutting \nissues and concerns identified through the surveys. Some areas that may be addressed include \nlong-term local currency finance, microfinance, and SME finance. \n \n3.  Prepare Results-Based Financial Sector Action Plans \n11.  Based on demand from Central and West Asian countries and survey results, the TA will \nsupport  the  preparation  of  results-based,  product-focused  financial  sector  action  plans  for \nparticipating Central and West Asian countries. These plans will be based on extensive dialogue \nwith key stakeholders in Central and West Asian countries to ensure strong ownership. They will \nalso  follow  up  on  areas  of  development  that  ADB  can  support  under  future  initiatives. \nAssistance from ADB to support the development of specific financial products and related \nimplementation support will be explored. Products may include innovative modalities to support \nSME financing, microinsurance, development of contractual savings products (including pension \nfunds), and debt instruments (long-term local currency finance), as well as products that create \nsynergies with other sectors such as urban services, energy, and transport.8 Relevant legal, \nregulatory, and institutional aspects will also be addressed. The action plans can also provide \nvaluable input to country program strategies for Central and West Asian countries. \n \n4.  Seminars and Training Programs \n12.  The TA will deliver regional, subregional, and national seminars and training programs. \nThe  topics  covered  will  be  identified  through  the  surveys  and  policy  discussions  with  key \nstakeholders, including regulatory and supervisory authorities. The topics will address shared \nemerging issues and concerns. The seminars will provide an opportunity to improve regulatory \ncooperation by bringing together key policy makers, financial sector regulators, and other key \nstakeholders (market institutions and participants, and members from academia and research \ninstitutions) to exchange ideas and learn from each other. The training programs will draw on \nthe  expertise  of  regulators  from  developed  ADB  member  countries  or  consultants  with \nsignificant regulatory and supervisory backgrounds. Depending on the identified training needs \nand levels of expertise of participants, training may cover either core areas of supervision and \nregulation  or  more  advanced  topics.9 Training  programs  will  be  held  in  host  institutions \nthroughout the region, as well as in other facilities, as needed. Training programs and seminars \nwill be provided free of charge. The TA will fund travel expenses of resource persons and a \nlimited  number  of  participants  from  each  country  who  meet  eligibility  criteria  that  will  be \ndeveloped  under  the  TA.  Central  and  West  Asian  countries  may  send  additional  eligible \nparticipants, who will need to pay their own travel costs and related expenses. \n \n                                                 \n8  Examples may include energy efficiency loans, renewable energy projects, and urban housing projects.  \n9 Potential topics could be (i) core banking supervisory issues, crisis management, risk-based supervision, problem \nbank resolution and liquidity risk management for banks; (ii) risk management, investigation and enforcement, \nmarket  supervision,  and  debt  instruments  for  securities  regulators;    and  (iii)  risk  management,  corporate \ngovernance, e-commerce, and micro-insurance for insurance regulators.  \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The cost of the TA is estimated to be the equivalent of $1,500,000. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe financing will cover the remuneration and travel expenses of international and national \nconsultants;  training  and  seminar  expenses;  costs  for  editing,  translation,  printing,  and \ndissemination of reports; and other miscellaneous expenses. The cost estimates and financing \nplan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, with the Central and West Asia Financial \nSector, Public Management and Trade Division (CWFM) acting as focal point and coordinator of \nconsultant inputs. To ensure complementarity in projects, CWFM will also work closely on \nrelevant issues with other divisions within Central and West Asia Department (CWRD), with the \nCapital Markets and Financial Sectors Division of the Private Sector Operations Department, \nand with the Office of Regional Economic Integration. The design and monitoring framework will \nbe used to monitor implementation progress (Appendix 1). ADB inputs will include consulting \nservices  and  training.  The  first  component  will  include  12  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 12 person-months of national consulting services to (i) carry out surveys \nand assessments, (ii) prepare working papers, and (iii) develop action plans. It is envisioned \nthat a firm will be hired for this component through quality- and cost-based selection with an \n80:20  weighting  using  a  simplified  technical  proposal.  Consultants  are  expected  to  have \nconsiderable experience in financial sector development. The second component will include 5 \nperson-months of international consulting services to (i) prepare training materials, (ii) deliver \ntraining programs, and (iii) participate in seminars, as requested. It is envisioned that a firm will \nbe hired through consultants qualification selection. However, if a firm is unable to provide the \nrequested highly specialized training or critical time constraints exist, ADB will hire individual \nconsultants. Consultants are expected to have considerable experience in delivering training for \nfinancial  sector  regulators  and  supervisors.  An  individual  national  consultant  with  project \nmanagement experience, preferably in the financial sector, will be hired for 6 person-months to \nprovide technical and administrative support for activities to be implemented under the TA. In \naddition, an individual international consultant will be hired for 2 person-months to edit action \nplans, working papers, and other material, as requested. Appendix 3 contains outline terms of \nreference for the consultants, all of whom will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The TA is expected to begin in December 2010 and be completed \nby December 2013. Good practices and lessons will be disseminated through policy dialogue \nwith  relevant  institutions  and  in  seminar  and  training  materials  and  knowledge  products \npublished under the TA. The no-objection of participating Central and West Asian countries will \nbe  confirmed  in  writing  prior  to  the  commencement  or  financing  of  TA  activities  in  those \ncountries. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n15.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis for \nFinancial Sector Development in Central and West Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved enabling  By 2018, rankings in  World Economic Forum  Macroeconomic and \nenvironment for  global business and  global competitiveness  financial market stability \nfinancial sector  competitiveness reports on  indicators   \ndevelopment  following indicators    Governments give \nimproved:a  World Bank Doing  priority to financial \n(i)  Ease of access to  Business indicators  sector development \nloans   \n(ii) Availability of financing  Risk \nthrough local equity  Insufficient leadership \nmarket  and ownership from \n(iii) Getting credit  senior stakeholders in \n(iv) Quality of regulation of  the financial sector  \nsecurities exchanges \n(v) Soundness of banks  \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nApplication of  Relevant authorities  ADB reports  Commitment to \nimproved design of  endorse action plans to    institutional, policy, and \ninstitutional, policy,  promote financial sector  Websites of relevant  regulatory measures \nand regulatory  development (Q4 2012)  authorities in Central  and their effective \nmeasures to address    and West Asian  implementation in \nidentified critical    countries   CWRD pipeline \nconstraints to financial     \nsector development  Good coordination \n  among stakeholders \n \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.

For purposes of engaging consultants, the technical assistance (TA) will include two \nmain components. The first component will include 12 person-months international consulting \nservices and 12 person-months of national consulting services to carry out (i) surveys and \nassessments, (ii) prepare working papers, and (iii) develop action plans. It is envisioned that a \nfirm will be hired for this component through quality and cost-based selection with simplified \ntechnical proposal and with an 80:20 weighting. The second component will include 5 person-\nmonths of international consulting services to (i) prepare training materials, (ii) deliver training \nprograms, and (iii) participate in seminars, as requested. It is envisioned that a firm will be hired \nthrough consultants qualification selection. However, should a firm not be able to provide the \nrequested highly specialized training or should critical time constraints arise, ADB will hire an \ninternational individual consultant. An individual national consultant will be hired for 6 person-\nmonths to provide technical and administrative support to activities to be implemented under the \nTA. An international individual consultant will be hired for 2 person-months for editing action \nplans, working papers, and other material, as requested. Consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nA.
