The  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), during the 2004 country programming mission, to provide technical \nassistance (TA) for the Development of Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) for the Cinda Asset \nManagement Company (CINDA). In addition, the Government indicated that the development of \nthe asset-backed securities market is a top priority. The Fact-Finding Mission1 visited Beijing \n18\u201326 November 2004 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, \nscope, and implementation arrangements for the TA.2 Appendix 1 gives the TA design and \nmonitoring framework.3\nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  PRC  financial  system  is  dominated  by  the  banking  industry.  State-owned \ncommercial banks (SOCBs), policy banks, joint stock commercial banks, city commercial banks, \nand rural commercial banks, on a combined basis, accounted for 82% of the total assets of the \nfinancial sector as of end-2003. The remaining 18% of total financial system resources is \ndivided up among credit cooperatives (10%), postal savings institutions (3%), nonbank financial \ninstitutions (3%, which consist of trust and investment companies, financing companies, and \nleasing  companies),  and  foreign-funded  financial  institutions  (2%).  The  banking  industry  is \ncontrolled by four SOCBs: Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China \n(BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Agricultural Bank of China (ABC). Their combined \nassets as of end-2003 amounted to CNY15.2 trillion and represented roughly 55% of total \nfinancial system resources, 67% of total domestic bank assets, and 130% of gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP).  They  also  accounted  for  approximately  90%  of  all  loans  to  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) and 70% of all loans to state-controlled infrastructure projects.  \n3.  Considering the rapid economic transition and growth of real sectors during the past two \ndecades, the financial sector has lagged behind. Financial market risk has become a major \nconcern for the sustained growth of the economy. At the center of the financial sector problem \nare (i) the high percentage of nonperforming (NPLs) held by SOCBs, their poor corporate \ngovernance,  weak  institutional  capabilities,  inadequate  operational  standards,  weak  capital \nbases, and low profitability; and (ii) underdeveloped capital markets. To reduce systemic risks in \nthe banking system, the disposition of NPLs and a sensible restructuring of the SOCBs are \ncritical. The Government established in 1999 four asset management companies (AMCs).4 The \nAMCs were not only charged with removing NPLs from the SOCBs, but also given the mandate \nto prevent future NPLs from accumulating and to find realistic ways to recover cash value from \nthe transferred NPLs. From 1999 to 2004, NPLs totaling CNY1.37 trillion were transferred at \nface value of the loan principal and interest from the SOCBs to the AMCs, financed by AMC \nbonds guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). By the end of December 2004, the four \nAMCs had disposed of CNY675 billion of such NPLs, with a cash collection of CNY137 billion. \nAlthough the NPL ratio of the SOCBs has declined over the past 3\u20134 years, it still remains high \n1  The Mission comprised Y. Qian, Principal Financial Economist of the Governance, Finance, and Trade Division of \nthe East and Central Asia Department. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 10 January 2005. \n3  Given the strategic importance of this TA for ADB and the PRC, three departments within ADB will partner together \nin working on this TA: (i) the Governance, Finance, and Trade Division of the East and Central Asia Department \n(ECGF); (ii) the Private Sector Operations Division (PSOP); and, (iii) the Office of the General Counsel (OGC). The \njoint effort of the three departments will maximize ADB\u2019s impact in this important project. \n4  CINDA was responsible for NPLs from CCB and the China Development Bank (CDB), the Huarong AMC for ICBC, \nthe Orient AMC for BOC, and the Great Wall AMC for ABC. ", "2\ncompared with that of other countries. The NPL ratio of the four SOCBs, based on the loan \nclassification system,5 was 22.2% in June 2003.  \n4.  One  of  the  four  AMCs  is  CINDA.  When  CINDA  was  established,  the  Government \ntransferred to it CNY394.6 billion NPLs from CCB and CDB. CINDA has also served as the \ncollection agent for an additional CNY112.8 billion of NPLs for MOF and CCB. Through a public \nauction in June 2004, CINDA acquired additional NPLs, with an outstanding principal amount of \nCNY128.9 billion and CNY149.8 billion at 31% of face value from CCB and BOC, respectively. \nThis  auction  was  a  major  policy  breakthrough.6  The  acquisition  was  financed  through  a \nrefinancing loan from the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC, the central bank) of CNY86 billion or \n$10 billion.   \n5.  The most recent purchase of NPLs by CINDA requires optimization of CINDA\u2019s funding \nsources and terms to match the timing and deal structure of its NPL workouts. Without adjusting \nits liabilities, CINDA will experience asset-liability mismatches, including a duration mismatch if it \nfollows a paced disposition schedule,7 and a currency mismatch if a portion of the NPLs are sold \nto foreign investors.8 CINDA is considering meeting its funding requirements by securitizing part \nof  its  NPL  portfolio  by  issuing  (international/domestic)  asset-backed  securities  (ABS).  This \nissuance  will  also  enable  CINDA  to  share  the  risks  of  NPL  collection  with  investors.9  A \nsecuritization process requires a pooling of (financial or tangible) assets. This asset pool will \nthen be sold to a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which will, in turn, sell securities to investors, \nbacked by the asset pool. In CINDA\u2019s case, this asset pool will consist of NPLs.  \n6.  The PRC bond market, to date, has exclusively served the public sector (i.e., national \ntreasury, central bank, and state-owned policy banks). The privilege to issue corporate bonds \nhas been only sparingly given to SOEs. Debt instruments include government bonds, financial \npolicy bonds, and central bank bills, accounting for 57.3%, 34.6%, and 5.3%, respectively. \nOutstanding corporate bonds make up an anemic 2.8%.10 The PRC\u2019s bond market represented \nabout 30% of GDP as of end-2000, one of the lowest ratios among the Asian bond markets. The \nAsian financial crisis has confirmed the need to develop long-term domestic bond markets.11\nThe ABS market is a critical feature of a more developed bond/capital market. \n7.  Securitization, as a financing tool, has enabled banks and corporations in Europe and \nthe United States to take advantage of various financial and structural benefits. In particular, \nsecuritization enables the issuer to issue securities with a higher rating (i.e., lower credit risk) \n5  The loan classification system has risk categories: normal, special attention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. The \nratio of 22.2% is very high compared with ratios in other countries with similar NPL classification standards such as \nUnited States (1\u20132%), France (3\u20134%), Republic of Korea (2\u20133%), and Japan (6\u20137%). It is even higher than the \npeak of NPLs in Korean banks in 1999 (13.6%) after the Asian financial crisis and the peak of NPLs in Japanese \nbanks in FY2001 (8.4%). \n6  Prior to this auction, commercial banks in the PRC were subject to strict MOF loan write-off rules, and were not \nallowed to sell loan principals at a discount and write off the losses. \n7  CINDA is required to repay the PBC loan in 18 months. If CINDA cannot complete NPL disposition in due time, \nPBC would need to roll over the refinancing package, thereby continuing the implicit subsidy to CINDA. \n8  Its short-term liabilities (i.e., 18-month PBC refinancing) will not match the long-term assets (i.e., NPLs stay on \nCINDA\u2019s book for longer terms). Foreign currency debt would be needed to hedge the foreign exchange risk. \n9  This has been done very successfully in the United States, Japan, Italy, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Mexico. \nIn Italy, ABSs for NPLs comprise 15% of the securitization market. In the Republic of Korea, KAMCO ABSs had \nabout 10% share in 2000. CINDA has explored the ABS concept and recently reached an agreement with \nDeutsche Bankfor NPL securitization of CNY2.55 billion in overseas markets. \n10According to Institutional Investors in the People\u2019s Republic of China (Working Paper Draft, ADB 2004), corporate \nbonds represent 5% or CNY170 billion of the total PRC bond market. \n11Underdeveloped bond markets narrow a country\u2019s choice in raising capital, leading to heavy reliance on the \nbanking system. Banks, on the other hand, risk mismatches in their maturity structures if they continue to provide \nlong-term capital given their short-term liabilities. Therefore, domestic bond markets have a crucial role to play, \nalong with domestic equity markets, in financing investments in areas critical to sustained economic growth. ", "3\nthan that which can be obtained through a direct corporate bond issue. Appendix 2 briefly \ndiscusses issues related to the ABS market. \n8.  ABS transactions impact on multiple legal and regulatory disciplines and agencies. It is \nwell established and recognized that mature and well-developed legal and regulatory regimes \ncovering  matters  ranging  from  taxation,  accounting,  and  the  issuance  of  securities  to \nsophisticated insolvency regimes are prerequisites for successful securitization transactions. \nSuccessfully addressing these issues is particularly challenging where laws and precedents do \nnot offer answers with a degree of certainty as is required by investors and rating agencies. In \nthe PRC, the development of a concrete securitization market has been stymied due to the lack \nof  a  legal  and  regulatory  regime  that  would  support  complex  securitization  transactions. \nSpecifically, obstacles to successful ABS issuances include the following: \n(i) Legal impediments. The main legal elements required for ABS transactions \ninclude (a) the ability to effectuate a true sale (i.e., the transfer of the economic \nbenefits and risks of the assets from the originator to the issuer); (b) preserving \nthe bankruptcy remote status of the entity to whom the assets are transferred \n(typically an SPV);12 (c) the avoidance of entity level taxation on the SPV; (d) \nperfection of the transfer of assets to the SPV; (e) statutory or other protection \nfrom the exercise of setoff rights with respect to the account debtor\u2019s underlying \ncontract; (f) avoidance of substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of \nthe SPV with those of the originator\u2019s bankrupt estate; and (g) the ability of the \nSPV to issue and sell the securities backed by the assets involved in the ABS \ntransaction. The lack of a centralized loan registration system, tax, accounting \nand related legal and regulatory issues combine to limit the ability of an AMC to \neffectuate  a  \u201ctrue  sale\u201d  and,  consequently,  achieve  the  key  ingredient  of  a \nsuccessful issuance of ABS. \n(ii) Lack  of  coordinated  efforts.  Issuance  of  ABS  for  NPLs  (and  other  asset \nclasses) will involve many agencies, including planning and fiscal authorities, the \ncentral bank, banking and capital market regulators, and lawmakers. Despite the \nkeen interest expressed by individual agencies, there is no effective coordination \namong policy makers and financial market regulators that would support ABS \ntransactions. \n(iii)  Market intermediary services. There are no developed professional standards \nfor services required for ABS transactions, such as credit rating, accounting, and \nlegal  services.  It  is  essential  that  the  relevant  professional  standards  are \nenhanced.\n9.  Despite the impediments to developing a flourishing securitization market in the PRC, \nthere are a number of encouraging factors: \n(i) Domestic  experience.  There  have  been  a  number  of  \u201cquasi  securitization\u201d \nattempts by domestic financial institutions, including the Huarong AMC\u2019s \u201cquasi \nABS\u201d in 2003 (effected through a trust investment plan for CNY13.3 billion of \nNPLs), and the Ningbo branch of the Industry and Commercial Bank\u2019s mortgage-\nbacked securitization of CNY2.6 billion.  \n12 PRC\u2019s Company Law requires a minimum capital of CNY30 million for a company limited by shares and CNY60 \nmillion for a limited-liability company. A company cannot issue debt instruments for more than 40% of its net \nassets, and average distributed profits over the past 3 years must be sufficient to meet the debt interest payments. \nA trust can have no more than 200 investors. These factors all serve to limit the ability of companies to engage in \nABS transactions.", "4\n(ii) Investor  interest.  The  number  of  institutional  investors  in  the  PRC  has \nincreased rapidly in recent years.13 They include commercial banks, insurance \ncompanies, social security funds, mutual funds, and qualified foreign institutional \ninvestors (QFIIs). Investors are keenly interested in fixed-income instruments \nsuch as ABS for better portfolio management.\n10. To facilitate the development of an ABS market and explore some of the deficiencies in \nthe PRC\u2019s legal and regulatory framework that would support securitization activities, the State \nCouncil has given PBC the mandate to undertake two asset-backed securitizations on an \nexperimental basis. Under PBC\u2019s guidance, CCB and CDB are in the preparatory stages of \nlaunching an asset-backed securitization transaction. These pilot studies will be used as a basis \nfor determining the steps that need to be taken to develop an effective and vibrant ABS market \nin the PRC.14\n11.  In addition to the PBC pilot securitization activities, CINDA plans to allocate CNY20 \nbillion from its recent NPL acquisition from BOC in Guangdong Province to form the asset pool \nfor its upcoming ABS issuance. The recovery cash flow from the NPLs will be used to repay the \nABS investors in the international and/or domestic capital markets. CINDA has set up a project \nteam to execute the transaction comprising core staff from its Investment Banking Department \nand Guangdong branch. However CINDA lacks core institutional capacity to structure and \nengage in the transaction. CINDA must develop strong ABS structuring and NPL servicing \ncapabilities to successfully execute a complicated ABS transaction.  \n12.  CINDA  also  recognizes  the  need  to  fundamentally  reorient  its  business  strategy, \norganization, and operational modalities to meet the challenges of ABS transactions. AMCs, \nincluding CINDA, have faced a number of impediments since their establishment: \n(i) Unclear institutional mandates. The 10-year life limit originally given to AMCs \nappears insufficient to resolve NPLs originating from SOEs and, unless SOEs \nare fundamentally restructured, NPLs will not be resolved successfully. Also, the \ngovernance and operational modalities of AMCs have been heavily influenced by \nthe  Government,  resulting  in  AMCs  lacking  proper  incentives  and  prudent \nmanagement.  \n(ii) Lack of proper legal and regulatory support. The lack of well-developed legal \nand regulatory structures, combined with the lack of a multidisciplinary response \nto AMC operations (that would serve to address specific AMC-related problems \nin an integrated fashion) serve to impede AMC operations.15\n(iii)  Inefficient resource allocation and mobilization. AMCs are 100% owned by \nMOF, cannot utilize their registered capital, and have not been authorized to \nmobilize additional funds.16 Most AMC staff were transferred from corresponding \nSOCBs, and lack comprehensive financial market skills. \n13 Estimates were that by the end of 2003, commercial banks in the PRC had CNY18.2 trillion in deposits; insurance \ncompanies had CNY912 billion of assets and CNY388 billion of annual prime income. The National Social Security \nFund had CNY120 billion in management, and mutual funds (54 close-ended and 56 open-ended) had CNY160 \nbillion in management. Private investment funds had CNY300 billion\u2013800 billion, and qualified foreign institutional \ninvestors (QFIIs) had pledged $1.7 billion. \n14 ADB\u2019s assistance has been requested in implementing these pilot transactions through technical assistance and it \nis expected that the experience and knowledge derived from the CDB and CCB pilot securitization transactions will \ncomplement the activities to be undertaken through component 3 of this TA. \n15 Many legal provisions in the Bankruptcy Law, Company Law, Securities Law, Civil Law, Guarantee Law, etc., make \nAMC operations difficult. \n16 MOF provided AMCs\u2019 day-to-day operating budgets, which are subject to strict controls. According to the Statute of \nthe Asset Management Corporations promulgated by the State Council, MOF has provided capital to four AMCs, \nand is responsible for supervising the AMCs. MOF\u2019s main tasks are (i) approving AMCs\u2019 organizational setup and ", "5\n13.  ADB supports PRC\u2019s financial sector reforms by (i) helping restructure and strengthen \nthe institutional capabilities of state-owned financial institutions; (ii) enhancing governance by \nstrengthening  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory  frameworks;  (iii)  encouraging  financial \ninstitutions to adopt sound corporate governance standards in harmony with international best \npractices; and (iv) developing the private sector by direct intervention in the form of guarantees, \nand debt and equity investments. ADB provided CINDA with technical assistance in 199917 to \nsupport its capabilities in institutional establishment and risk management. ADB also provided \ntechnical assistance to financial market regulators for streamlining laws and regulations in the \nbanking,  securities,  and  insurance  markets;  and  to  law-making  bodies  in  preparation  for \nadopting the Securities Law, Trust Law, and Bankruptcy Law.18\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The advisory TA will, through the actual process of engaging in an ABS transaction, \nassist in establishing a conducive policy, legal, and regulatory environment for ABS market \ndevelopment by structuring the issuance of international/domestic ABS for CINDA; exploring \nrestructuring strategies for state-owned AMCs by commercializing/incorporating CINDA; and \nassisting in the process of developing an effective and comprehensive legal, regulatory and \npolicy  framework  that  will  support  ABS  transactions  and  otherwise  establish  a  vibrant \nsecuritization market in the PRC. Broadly, the development of the broader securitization market \nwill aid in the growth and development of the corporate bond market in the PRC.19\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will be implemented through three closely interrelated components as follows: \n(i)  assisting  CINDA\u2019s  ABS  project  team  in  actually  preparing  the  first \ninternational/domestic ABS issuance from the PRC (component 1);  \n(ii)  facilitating the restructuring and corporatization of CINDA and, based on the \nexperience,  providing  proper  restructuring  recommendations  for  other  AMCs \n(component 2);20 and\nbusiness scope; (ii) approving AMCs\u2019 financing; (iii) setting on the supervisory board of each AMC; (iv) formulating \nregulations on NPL resolution and operation of AMCs; (v) setting up AMCs\u2019 operational target on NPL resolution, \nand carrying out assessment and supervision; (vi) formulating the financial regulation and the accounting regulation \nof AMCs, and approving major financial affairs; (vii) studying and proposing reform and development schemes for \nAMCs; and (viii) studying and proposing solutions for AMCs\u2019 losses from NPL resolution. \n17 ADB. 1999.

Cost and Financing  \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent, of which $615,000 is in \nforeign exchange and $635,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $1,000,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $385,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government, through local agencies, will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $250,000, through the provision of office space, counterpart staff, \ntransportation, and other services. Appendix 3 gives the detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MOF will be the Executing Agency to provide overall leadership and policy coordination \namong the three TA components. CINDA will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for component 1. \nMOF and CINDA will be the IAs for component 2. PBC will be the IA for component 3. The TA \nwill engage five international and six domestic consultants for a total of 11 and 19 person-\nmonths, respectively. Appendix 4 gives the terms of reference for the consultants. Given the \nbroad range of components to be covered under the TA, each consultant will be selected and \nengaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. \nThe TA will begin in August 2005 and will be completed in December 2006. Workshops will be \nheld periodically to invite comments from international and domestic experts, and to disseminate \nthe findings in the reports. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Development  of  Asset-Backed \nSecurities Market and Restructuring of Asset Management Companies and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n21OGC will take the lead in implementing this TA component.

The  Asian  financial  crisis  has  confirmed  the  need  to  develop  further  the  long-term \ndomestic bond markets in the region. Despite generally high rates of savings, long-term savings \nhave not been efficiently mobilized. Private sector investments in rapidly growing emerging \neconomies have had to be financed with short-term foreign borrowing. To avoid the risk of \nmismatches, governments in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) have been looking \nfor ways to address this issue, often combined with measures to address systematic risks \ncaused by the high ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) and nonperforming assets (NPAs) in \ntheir respective banking systems. This is especially the case in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC).\n2.  Underdeveloped bond markets narrow a country\u2019s choice in raising capital, leading them \nto rely heavily on the banking system. Banks, on the other hand, risk mismatches in their \nmaturity structures if they continue to provide long-term capital given their short-term liabilities. \nFor lack of alternative sources of domestic long-term capital, in the past firms often turned to \ninternational wholesale credit markets, and thus exposed themselves to exchange-rate risks in \nthe payment of debt. The Asian crisis has worsened those risks and has reduced the flow of \nportfolio lending to Asian countries. Very little long-term capital is being mobilized in the region. \nClearly, domestic bond markets, along with domestic equity markets, have a crucial role to play \nin  financing  investments  in  areas  critical  to  sustained  economic  growth.  Reforms  in  these \nmarkets are thus a key part of financial market reform in Asia in general. A crucial element of a \nfunctioning capital market is issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS).  \n3.  Asset-backed securitization is a highly structured financing technique that provides an \nentity with an economical means of financing without the added burden of increasing debt \nand/or equity. In its simplest form, securitization is a process whereby the revenue stream on a \nsegregated pool of receivables or other income-producing (mostly financial) assets owned by an \noriginal  lender  or  commercial  enterprise  (originator)  is  repackaged  into  tradable  securities \nissued to investors. The receivables are sold by the originator to a specially incorporated, off-\nbalance sheet company or trust, known as a special-purpose vehicle (SPV). In return, the SPV \nwill generally pay a purchase amount equal to the (par or net present) value of the receivables \nand with limited recourse or no recourse against the originator for nonperformance of the \nunderlying debtors.\n4.  The  SPV  will  be  structured  to  control  its  income  and  expenses  so  that  it  will  be \n\u201cbankruptcy remote.\u201d The SPV will fund the purchase of the receivables through the issue of \ndebt securities to investors, which will be secured on the receivables by virtue of a security \ninterest granted to a security trustee acting for the investors and other creditors. The originator \n(or an associated company) may continue to act as the servicer in collecting and administering \nthe receivables as an agent of the SPV, who in turn will apply the income from the receivables \nto make payment of principal and interest under the debt securities as well as transaction \nexpenses. A standby servicer may also be arranged in case the originator fails to perform its \nservicing obligations. Funds received by the SPV in excess of those required to pay investors \nare generally channeled back to the originator. Thus, securitization enables nontradable assets \nthat range in marketability, credit-worthiness, and size to become liquid secondary instruments \nthrough repackaging and cash flow structuring.   \n5.  Various forms of credit and liquidity enhancement will be used and structured into the \ntransaction cash flow to ensure that payments on the debt securities issued to the investors are \nmade in full and on a timely basis. Consequently, the recourse of the investors is usually limited \nto (i) the receivables, (ii) the transaction cash flow, and (iii) the credit enhancement incorporated \nin the securitization structure. A high credit rating (usually higher than that of the originator) on ", "Appendix 2 9\nthe debt securities and therefore cheaper funding can be obtained by reason of the quality of \nthe receivables, the isolation of the receivables from the other risks of the originator\u2019s business \n(by  arranging  a  \u201ctrue\u201d  sale  of  the  receivables  from  the  originator  to  the  SPV),  and  the \narrangements for credit enhancement and liquidity support.  \n6.  Several  factors  call  for  the  development  of  a  PRC  securitization  market.  (i)  The \ndevelopment of the bond and securitization market in particular would reduce the problem of \ncredit tightening as it would release scarce capital of PRC banks, enabling new lending. (ii) \nSecuritization technology could be used to reduce the NPL problem, as new investor bases \ncould be tapped. (iii) Given the increased competitiveness and consolidation process in the \nfinancial and corporate sectors, especially after World Trade Organization entrance in 2007, \nwith a fast-changing environment where the mechanics of competition among lenders turn on \nincreasingly tough return on equity (ROE) targets, securitization would allow PRC banks to \nincrease their returns by redeploying the same equity. A bank can make loans at market rates, \nand then securitize a pool at a lower rate due to diversification and the efficiencies inherent in \ntranching cash flows. With banks becoming more conscious of the cost of capital and more \naware of the need to diversify their sources of funding, securitization of bank portfolios would \nbecome a core tool of balance-sheet management. (iv) Securitization would offer PRC banks a \nnew kind of intermediary role by redistributing credit risk in the same way that an insurance \nprovider pools individuals\u2019 exposures to loss or accident. In the traditional model, banks did this \nby matching pools of borrowing with pools of deposits. In securitization, they package credit for \ncapital market investors rather than depositors. To do this effectively, a bank needs a diversified \nexposure to credit risk\u2014and this is where size wins prizes.   \n7.  Securitization offers an effective means of improving the capital adequacy of the banking \nand financial sectors, both critical elements in improving the overall performance of the PRC \nfinancial  sector.  The  development  of  the  securitization  market  will  aid  in  the  growth  and \ndevelopment of the corporate bond market in the PRC in four ways:  \n(i) Credit rating culture. Based on international past precedents, an independent \ncredit rating system represents a key component in the development of a well-\nfunctioning  corporate  bond  market.  Only  when  investors  have  comfort  in  an \nindependent rating system will they be able to properly assess the true credit risk \nin corporate and other bonds.  \n(ii)   Credit  pricing  process.  Securitization  issuance  will  also  develop  the  credit \npricing curve. Securitization results directly in the sophistication, consistency, and \ntransparency of the credit pricing process. One of the reasons for the PRC\u2019s \nrelatively small (corporate) bond market is the regulatory constraint that interest \nrates on corporate bonds should not exceed 40% of the equivalent rates of bank \ndeposits.1 Thus, currently investors may elect not to invest in corporate bonds \ndue to the associated higher risks relative to yield.  \n(iii)   Increased  Number  of  institutional  investors.  With  the  growth  of  the \nsecuritization market, more institutional investors will come into the PRC, acting \nto enhance competition and increase liquidity for the market as a whole.   \n(iv)  Diversification for investors. Securitization issuance and the supply of a wide \nrange of new financial assets will enable institutional investors to better achieve \ntheir goals of creating stable, diversified asset portfolios that offer them a better \nof chance of achieving their return and risk management objectives. \n1 ADB.  2004.
