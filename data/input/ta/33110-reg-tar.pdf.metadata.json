Many of the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs)\nhave recognized the need to provide access to employment under acceptable conditions. The\napplication of  labor standards contributes to  economic and social progress. The ADS's\n1 \noverarching goal of poverty reduction and its strategic development  objectives of economic\ngrowth,  improving  the  status of women, and human development  are closely linked to the\nimprovement of the conditions of the poor of the Asia Pacific region. The poor are mainly the\nworking poor, most of whom are informal sector workers. The majority are women and children\nforced to work often under hazardous and harmful conditions. The improved implementation of\nselected  labor  standards  can  help in gradually  eliminating  the worst  forms  of  child  labor,\nimprove the conditions for women's employment, and improve occupational safety and health\nfor workers in small-scale enterprises. This technical assistance (TA  ) will address the need to\nstrengthen the  role of labor standards in selected  DMCs and within ADB, for  an improved\nunderstanding and implementation of selected labor standards in the DMCs, and in relation to\nADB operations.2 The TA   logical framework is in Appendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  Over the past several decades, the world community through the International Labour\nOrganisation (ILO) has negotiated covenants and recommendations to protect the interests of\nvulnerable groups. ILO considers seven labor standards as the fundamental rights of human\nbeings at work. They include labor standards that address the basic concems of human welfare,\nwomen's participation in the labor force, children who are put to work on account of economic\ncircumstances, and people who work in the informal sector in small enterprises. ILO addresses\nthese concerns through its activities with governments, workers' and employers' organizations,\nas well as in cooperation with nongovernment organizations (NGO), and a variety of civil society\norganizations.\n3.  Discrimination  against women  in employment  and  occupation  is widespread  in the\nregion.  ILa  Convention  No.  111 stresses the  need  for  members  to  promote  equality  of\nopportunity and treatment in respect of employment and occupation, with a view to eliminating\nany discrimination based on sex. While it is indisputable that women's economic contribution is\nsignificant for  economic growth and for the well-being  of their families, there are persistent\ngender gaps in employment, earnings and benefits. Women's  labor force participation rates\nhave risen rapidly everywhere in the region between 1985 and 1997. Research shows that the\nexpansion in export production, which fueled the economic boom in the region, was itself based\non the growing use of women as wage workers. However, women consistently earned lower\nwages than men in the aggregate, with wage gaps ranging from 48 percent in the Republic of\nKorea to 36 percent in Thailand.3 This reflects the widespread gender discrimination in pay,\nwhere women are paid less than men even for identical or similar jobs. Gender discrimination in\nemployment and occupations has been exacerbated in the region by the recent financial crisis.\nThis is evident from research showing that, along with other impacts of the crisis, more women\nworkers than men have lost jobs in many countries affected by the crisis, and more stress is\nbeing put on the need for women to go back to traditional gender roles. Several DMCs have\n1  The TA first appearedi n ADB BusinessO  pporlunitJe(sIn temet Edition)i n August 1999.\n2  An ADS Mission visited ILO in Mard11999.

However\nimplementation is hampered by the lack of awareness, information, implementation capacity,\nand systematic monitoring and evaluation of legislation.\n4.  ILO estimates the total number of child workers to be about 250 million worldwide, and\nAsia is home to 61 percent. ILO Convention 138 on the Minimum Age aims at the effective\nabolition of child labor and at raising the level of the minimum age at which  admission to\nemployment is possible. Convention 182 (1999) for the Prohibition of and Immediate Action for\nthe Elimination of Worst Forms of Child Labor targets children forced to work under all forms of\nslavery and similar arrangements, in illicit activities, as well as in work which by its very nature,\nor under the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety, or\nmorals of children. This Convention is being ratified by a number of DMCs. Child workers in the\nregion are found working  in hazardous  enterprises in Asia such  as  in  garbage  collection,\nquarrying, brick making, and the sex trade. Bonded child workers  are found  in agriculture,\ncarpet weaving, textiles, and other industries. Girls are particularly exploited through trafficking\nin the sex trade, which has intensified as a result of the Asian crisis. The promotion of access to\neducation, nutrition, and health for children is closely linked to the progressive elimination of at\nleast the worst forms of child labor. ILO's International Program for the  Elimination of Child\nLabor (IPEC) has the same objectives. The IPEC works in close cooperation with governments,\nemployers' and workers' organizations, NGOs, universities and other local institutions, as well\nas the media. Some DMCs including Nepal and the Philippines have ratified Convention 138 on\nraising the minimum age for admission to employment. But implementation of child labor-related\nconventions is constrained on account of the socioeconomic factors that form part of the current\nAsian development environment, lack of information and guidelines, and poor implementation\ncapacity, among others.\n5.  Occupational safety and health are emerging as important issues in the region where\ntechnological developments and new work procedures without necessary safety and protection,\nhave given rise to new hazards and risks of accidents and diseases. Convention 155 lays out\nthe basic framework for member states to address the issues through legislation, policy making,\nand implementation. A wealth of data and information exists on occupational safety and health\nissues in small and medium-sized enterprises and many lessons have been drawn. While small\nenterprises contribute greatly to economic growth in developing countries and account for most\nemployment opportunities, they are also often characterized by poor working conditions and\nhazardous working environments. They often do not have access to the skills, expertise, and\nfinance that they need for safety and health measures. Convention 155 is yet to be ratified by\nmost of the DMCs. However, some DMCs have ratified related conventions (Appendix 2). There\nis a need to disseminate knowledge and information on these issues, and identify ways and\nmeans, and guidelines and instruments with which to effectively improve the conditions at the\nworkplace.\n~\nI\n6.  These labor standards are closely related to the achievement of ADB's overarching goal\nof poverty reduction and its strategic development objectives of improving the status of women,\nhuman development, and protection of the environment. Because poverty is a major cause of\nchild labor, ADB's emphasis on poverty reduction is closely linked with efforts to end the worst\nforms  of  child  labor as well  as  to  take  child workers  out of  harmful  activities,  and  raise\nawareness  of  such  issues.  Similarly,  awareness  of  issues  of  gender  discrimination  in\nemployment as well as improving occupational health and safety in small-scale enterprises, and\nefforts to address these in future ADB  operations, are important in strengthening women's\neconomic  participation,  and  improving  the  well-being  of  the  working  poor.  They  are\ninterconnected with the success of ADB 's policies and operations in the region and are also\n~", "3\nrelevant to social protection, which is a more recent area of concern for ADB, and which is an\nessential component of a comprehensive social policy. Under this, priority issues include among\nothers, labor market policies and programs designed to facilitate adjustments and enforce labor\nstandards and regulations against child labor, particularly the worst forms of child labor.\n7.  It is necessary to accelerate action within both the DMCs and ADB to protect the\ninterests of working children and women workers, as well as address the occupationals afety\nand health concerns of informal sector workers in small-scalee nterprises.T  here Is a serious\ndearth of informationa nd analysis of the socio-economicc osts of perpetuatingh armful labor\npractices, which negativelya  ffect economic and social development,p erpetuate poverty, and\nadverselya ffect human developmenta nd the quality of life. Improveda ccess to informationa nd\nanalysis, guidelines, and examples of good practice can go a long way in building capacity\nthrough awareness creation, and training in ways to address such concerns in economic\nplanning in the DMCs, and in the context of ADB operations.T his TA will mak~ an innovative\nstart in this direction.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTA  NCE\nObjective\n8.  The goal of the TA   is to strengthen the role of labor standards for sustainable economic\nand social development in ADB's DMCs. The purpose is to help the DMCs and ADB to address\nkey labor standard issues in development interventions assisted by ADB, as well as in their\noverall development. The objectives are as follows:\n(i)  Increase an awareness of key policy makers in the DMCs, NGOs, and the private\nsector, regarding the economic and social implications of the non implementation\nof labor standards (Appendix 1).\n(ii) Improve the capacity of policy makers in DMCs and ADS staff to prepare and\nimplement  projects,  that  would  (a)  move  children  from  the  worst  forms  of\nemployment and to school; (b) improve employment for women; and (c) reduce\noccupational safety and health hazards.\n(iii) Enable ADB staff at headquar1earsn d countryl evelst o addresst he issueso f\npover1y reduction, child  labor, gender discrimination in  employment, and\noccupational$ afety and health issues by strengtheningt he implementationo f\nrelevantl abor standardsi n ADB-assistedd evelopmentin terventions.\nB.  Scope\nThe T A covers these  areas\n(i)  Child labor  The  TA's  child  labor  component  will  (a)  collect  and  analyze\ninformation on the worst forms of child labor in the selected  DMCs, and  its\nimplications vis-a-vis economic growth,  poverty reduction, and the  spread  of\nuniversal basic education; (b) document examples of innovative and sustainable\nways to address the issue of child labor; (c) based on (b), develop a handbook\nwith checklists and examples of good practice on how to address potential child\nlabor-related implications in the context of ADB operations in the region as well\nas in development planning in the DMCs; (d) prepare a regional report on the", "4\nworstf orms of child labor; and (e) prepare strategies and recommendations for\nthe Regional Framework and Action Plan for the use of ADB staff and the DMCs.\nGender discrimination in emDlovment and occuDation  The TA will (a) collect\n(ii)\nand analyze data on the comparative situation of men and women in the labor\nmarket in both the formal and informal sectors, in the selected DMCs, and the\nsocioeconomic impacts of gender discrimination on economic growth, poverty\nreduction, and social development; (b) review  national  legislation  relevant to\nwomen's employment and position in the labor market; (c) develop a handbook\non  ways  to  address  gender  discrimination  in  employment  and  occupations,\nincluding guidelines, checklists and examples of good practice; (d) prepare a\nregional  report;  and  (e)  prepare  strategies  and  recommendations  for  the\nRegional Framework and Action Plan, for the use of  DMCs and ADB staff.\n(iii)  Occuoational safetY and health  The  TA  will  (a)  carry  out  comprehensive\nsurveys to identify the most pressing needs and issues in the selected DMCs,\nand analyze the impacts of lack of occupational safety and health on economic\ngrowth, poverty reduction, and social development; (b) identify ways in which\nthese issues can be addressed including national policy recommendations and\naction plans for implementation in the identified sectors; (c) prepare a handbook\nwith checklists and examples of good practice for national policy makers and\nstaff  of  executing  agencies  (EAs) to  address  such  concerns  in  small-scale\nenterprises in the informal sector; (d) prepare a regional report on  occupational\nsafety and health issues in small-scale enterprises; and (e) prepare strategies\nand recommendations for the Regional Framework and Action Plan for use by\nthe DMCs and ADB staff.\n10.  The TA includes the following activities common to the international labor standards in\nthe  areas  listed  above:  (i)  collection  and  analysis of  information;  (ii)  preparation  of three\nhandbooks; (iii) a two-day national workshop in each selected DMC; (iv) preparation of regional\nreports related to the three labor standards; (v) preparation of the Regional Framework and\nAction Plan for ADB and its DMCs; and (vi) a two-day regional seminar to be held at ADB's\nheadquarters in Manila, which will bring together policy makers from the DMCs, staff of EAs,\ninternational agencies, trade unions, employers' organizations, private sector, NGOs,  and ADB\nstaff, to discuss the outputs of the TA and the Regional Framework and Action Plan.\n11.  The DMCs to be covered are Bangladesh, Nepal, Philippines and Thailand. The four\nhave ratified a large number of relevant conventions, but face problems of implementation\n(Appendix 2). They have indicated their interest in participating in the TA. ILa has area offices in\nthree of the selected DMCs; in Nepal, a senior ILa adviser is stationed. Some ongoing national\nprograms in all the selected DMCs are being carried out in collaboration with ILa  related to\neach of the three labor standards and these will provide a useful starting point for the activities\nto be undertaken under the TA  .\nc.\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $928,000 equivalent (see Appendix  3). This\nincludes ADB's contribution of $300,000 which will be financed on a grant basis from the ADB\nfunded TA program. ILO's contributions will include the following: (i) in-kind contributions in the\nform of expert services, reports, management services, as well as technical and administrative\nsupport amounting to the equivalent of $441,000; plus (ii) parallel financing in the amount of", "5\n$27,000 in 1999 and $60,000 in the year 2000. In addition, the Governmento  f Norway will\nprovide a grant of $100,000.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n13.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 14 months commencing in March 2000 and\nending in April 2001. ILO will be the Executing Agency. ILO has in-depth experience in technical\ncooperation  with the  four  DMCs, particularly  in the areas  of child  labor,  gender  issues in\nemployment and occupation, and occupational safety and health in small-scale enterprises.\nProject Advisory Committees (PAC) will be set up in the DMCs. The ministries of finance and\nlabor will jointly convene the PACs, with membership drawn from the sectoral ministries, NGOs,\ntrade unions, employers' organizations. research institutions, media, ILO, and ADS.  The PACs\nwill meet on a quarterly basis to provide guidance to the consultants and oversee their work.\nThe PACs in consultation with ILO and ADS will select participants for the national workshops.\nThree  international and  12 domestic consultants (Consultant Team) will be engaged  in the\nareas  of  child  labor,  gender  equity,  and  occupational  safety  and  health,  for  a  period  of\napproximately 49 person-months, to prepare the country reports and Regional Framework and\nAction Plan. The outline terms of reference are presented in Appendix 4. ADS will select all\nconsultants  as  per the  ADS's  Guidelines  on  the  Use of  Consultants.  Staff  of  the  Social\nDevelopment Division (SOCD) will supervise the TA in consultation with an informal working\ngroup  drawn from the  Task  Force on Social  Protection Framework, Office  of the  General\nCounsel (OGC), and the Poverty Unit, among others.\n14.  The ILO Manila office will act as the focal point for the TA. A working group will be set up\nin ILO Geneva to provide technical inputs to the study. ILO's area offices in the selected DMCs\nwill be providing considerable staff time toward supervision of the consultants and coordinating\nthe  preparation of the  outputs of the TA.  Full coordination between ADB  and  ILO will  be\nensured.\n15.  An inceptionm  eetingw  ill be held in Manilat o finalize the work programo f the consulting\nteam. SOCDs taff, ILO, as well as the Team Leaderw  ill participatei n this meeting.F  our national\nworkshops,o ne in each DMC, and a regional seminart o be held at ADB headquarters,w ill be\norganized under the TA  . At the national workshops,t he findings and recommendationso f the\ncountry studies will be presentedt o stakeholdersf or their review. A regional seminar will be\norganizedb y ADB in collaborationw ith ILO in Manila.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'SD ECISION\n16.  The President, acting Under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the\nBank administering a portion of the technical assistance to be financed by the Government of\nNorway on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $100,000; and (ii) the\nprovision of technical assistance to be financed by ADB on a grant basis, in an amount not\nexceeding the equivalent of $300,000, both for the purpose of Improving the Role of Labor\nStandards in Selected DMCs, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "\u00bb'0i:]Cox'~ '0Q)(QCD~\n...m(\"):I:Zn>r->cncncn >'z(\")mr-0G')n>r- \"T1~>~m~0~A\n9\nJ.\n{", "\u00abCo~ c:cx~ Co(U0>Q)N\n7", "<Co8- c:cx~ ComC)Q) (t)\n8", "<Q.8- c--a)(~ Q.(UC)Q)\"ft'\na: cD ~ 0- ~ - 'v~ 'v u ~~ ~5  8 ~ ~ ~ .c ~ C 1J. ~ .e ~ '- 'Ui cu \"0 - ~ C/)  ~ = 0 'Ui '- Q) - '- 0 cu 0::5 C = '- ~ Q) '- C m C) 0 Q) '0 ~ .2 - - Q) .2 ~ C) c 2: C .Co Q) cu \"tV < .2 .- -L C C \"0 Q) ~ u..mcu ~~=e > ~C/)- ~ 8. ~ E .! ~ cu Q) ~ '- Q) - - ~ u ~ ~ '-\" ~ ~ C/) .\"-  g ~ ,g g ~ 0 0.
