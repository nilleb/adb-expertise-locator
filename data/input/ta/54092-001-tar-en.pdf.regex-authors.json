INTRODUCTION \n \n  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  the  Government  of \nKazakhstan to strengthen the overall capacity of the recently established National Quality Center \nfor Road Assets (NQCRA). The TA will specifically support the formulation of (i) guidelines and \ndraft amendments or additions to the national regulations for road maintenance, road design, \nasset management, and economic analysis, including traffic forecasting; (ii) manuals and public \noutreach materials to enhance the country's driving culture and road quality management; and \n(iii) the principles of a competency framework for professional and technical staff working in the \nroad transport system with a view to achieving international anti-bribery management standards.1 \n \n  This TA was included in the country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 for Kazakhstan \nas  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Development  at  the  request  of  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and \nInfrastructure Development (MIID) in 2019.2 The detailed requirements for the TA were set out in \nthe letter from the Committee of Roads (COR) dated 24 January 2020.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n  Situated in the heart of Eurasia, Kazakhstan is the world\u2019s largest landlocked country and \nthe ninth-largest country overall, with a land area of 2.7 million square kilometers\u2014equal to that \nof Western Europe. It is adjacent to the inland Caspian and Aral seas and bordered to the north \nand west by the Russian Federation, to the east by the People\u2019s Republic of China, and to the \nsouth by the Kyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. \n \n  Kazakhstan has a total road length of 97,000 kilometers (km).  The republican road \nnetwork consists of about 23,500 km of roads and is the main network of roads in the country. It \nincludes (i) international corridors, (ii) main national road network, and (iii) the toll road network. \nApproximately 92% of the republican roads have an asphalt concrete pavement, although about \n8% are gravel or unpaved roads.  The road density is very low at only 3.5 km per 100 square \nkilometers. There are five technical road categories, from I (four or more lanes) to V (a single \nlane). Category II and Category III roads account for 85% of the republican road network. \nAccording to the Global Competitiveness Report 2018,3 Kazakhstan currently has a rating of 106 \nout of 140 in terms of road quality. As of 1 January 2020, 51% of the republican roads were \nestimated to be in good condition and 37% in satisfactory condition (88% in total), and 28% of \noblast and local roads were estimated to be in good condition and 43% in satisfactory condition \n(71% in total). According to the Nurly Zhol 2020\u20132025 state program, the share of republican \nroads in good and satisfactory condition will be increased to 100%, while that of oblast and district \nroads will be increased to 95%.4 The number of road accidents is high in Kazakhstan, costing it \nan estimated $8.1 billion per year and claiming far too many lives (17.6 per 100,000 inhabitants). \nWhile the Ministry of Internal Affairs is responsible for implementing a road safety strategy\u2014\nincluding coordination, legislation, and monitoring and evaluation\u2014more needs to be done to \nreduce the accidents.     \n \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 July 2020. \n2  ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Kazakhstan, 2020\u20132022. Manila. Upon request of the Government \nof Kazakhstan, the TA was reformulated from \u201cTransport Sector Strategy Development\u201d to \u201cInstitutional Support to \nthe National Quality Center for Road Assets,\u201d as documented in the updated country operations business plan (2021\u2013\n2023).  \n3  World Economic Forum. 2018. The Global Competitiveness Report 2018. Geneva (accessed 13 November 2020). \n4  Government of Kazakhstan. 2020. Under Nurly Zhol State Program, it is planned to implement 112 infrastructure \nprojects by 2025. (21 April). \n ", "2 \n \n  Kazakhstan\u2019s economic development strategy identifies a strong transport sector as a key \ncontributing element to promoting economic growth and diversification. The plan for developing \nroad transport includes not only the improvement of road infrastructure but also a combination of \ninstitutional and regulatory reforms, further economic liberalization of the sector, and better road \nmaintenance. Knowledge products and services are required to help boost system performance, \nwith a focus on innovation in road maintenance and contracts based on defect-free performance. \n \n  The road system in Kazakhstan is governed by MIID, which is responsible for (i) improving \nthe regulatory framework, (ii) managing the roads of international and national importance through \nCOR, (iii) implementing state policy, and (iv) ensuring compliance with regulations. MIID finances \nKazAvtoZhol, a national road network operator responsible for the construction, operation, and \nmaintenance of republican roads. KazakhAvtoDor LLP, a contractor privatized in mid-2019, \ncarries out routine maintenance works, landscaping, and emergency response. KazDorNII, a joint \nstock company, is COR\u2019s design and research institute. It carries out road survey, design, and \nresearch work, and draws up technical regulations and standards.  \n \n  The NQCRA was established on 19 March 2019 and is directly subordinate to COR.5 The \nrationale behind it was to provide an independent entity outside of the normal contractual \nrelationships between engineering organizations and contractors, one that acts as a center of \nexcellence in road asset management and road safety. It is intended that the NQCRA will be \nenabled and empowered to develop a robust road management system and bring a life-cycle \napproach to the management of road assets. Its key responsibilities include the examination of \nthe quality of works and materials in the construction, reconstruction, repair, and maintenance of \nroads, as well as quality assurance in the management of road assets. To achieve these goals, \nthe NQCRA carries out the following activities: (i) quality control and/or quality assurance of work \nand materials used in road projects; (ii) development and approval of technical standards; \n(iii) improvements in the quality of construction, reconstruction, repair, and maintenance of roads; \n(iv) inspection, verification, and technical audits of construction works and maintenance repairs \ncarried out on roads; (v) road condition surveys, including testing and structural evaluation of \npavements,  bridges,  and  other road  assets;  and  (vi)  safety monitoring  and  audits  of  road \ninfrastructure assets, especially on  roads of national and international significance. Furthermore, \nit is the role of the NQCRA to bring innovation to road transport in the form of (i) new technologies \nand materials, (ii) updated road asset management systems, (iii) travel demand forecasting, \n(iv) assistance in taking and enforcing anticorruption measures, and (v) road safety. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n  The TA is aligned with the following impact: transformation of Kazakhstan into a modern \nsociety with a knowledge-based, diversified, and private sector-driven economy accelerated.6 \nThe TA will have the following outcome: capacity of the NQCRA strengthened.7 \n \n \n5 As of September 2020, the NQCRA has 329 staff (121 of them women)\u201435 in managerial (5 women), 78 in technical \n(16 women), and 216 in administrative (100 women) positions. COR has 63 staff (27 women)\u201416 in managerial (6 \nwomen), 30 in technical (9 women), and 17 in administrative (12 women) positions. \n6  Government of Kazakhstan. 2012. Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy.

Nur-Sultan. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n  Output 1: Guidelines and draft amendments or additions to the national regulations \nfor  road  maintenance,  road  design,  and  asset  management  with  associated  training \ndeveloped. The TA team will help strengthen the capacity of the NQCRA by (i) introducing new \ntechnologies,  materials,  and  support  for  innovation  and  development  in  road  transport; \n(ii) improving the regulatory and legal framework for road transport, including financing for the \ndevelopment of a life-cycle costing model; and (iii) procuring travel-demand forecasting software \n(PTV Visum) to forecast traffic flows, and associated training. The TA primarily aims to support \nthe NQCRA in elevating the quality of design and implementation of roadworks by developing \nseveral manuals and guidance notes. This will include the amendments of national standards or \nregulations governing (i) road configuration, (ii) works performed during maintenance relative to \ntraffic flows, (iii) road maintenance activities on urban roads, (iv) the introduction of building \ninformation modeling (BIM) technology, and (v) integration of climate change risk analysis in road \ndesign. During the inception phase, the TA scope will be further refined through a needs \nassessment to ascertain which guidelines and national regulations should be updated. This will \nensure the most effective use of the available resources and define how the outputs are converted \ninto  knowledge  products  that  can  be  disseminated  through  the  Asia-Pacific  Senior  Roads \nExecutive Programme.8 All activities will be supported by training given to COR and NCQRA staff.   \n \n  Output 2: Manuals and public outreach materials to enhance the driving culture and \nroad quality management developed. At least two sets of guiding notes and public outreach \nmaterials on road safety and road quality, such as videos, will be produced according to COR and \nNQCRA needs, and disseminated through social media and print products. Consultations will be \nsought with civil society organizations for the development of manuals and outreach materials, to \nensure that the outputs are suited to end users' needs. Lessons from other TAs related to road \nsafety and supported by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) will be adopted as \nappropriate.9 \n \n  Output 3: Competency framework for professional and technical staff working in \nthe road transport subsector delivered. Policies and procedures required to ensure compliance \nwith International Organization for Standardization (ISO) norms, such as ISO 37001, will be \ndeveloped in consultation with professional associations and other key stakeholders. The NQCRA \nstaff will receive training on road construction quality and ISO 37001\u2014Anti-Bribery Management \nSystems.10 The TA team will also develop a road map for the potential ISO 37001 accreditation.11  \n.\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJFPR, and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n \n8 For 20 years, the Senior Road Executive Programme, run in collaboration with the International Road Federation and \nheld for the first time in Asia in February 2019, has been providing continuing professional development to senior \nstaff working in the road transport subsector.
