INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB), through the proposed knowledge and support \ntechnical assistance (TA), will establish and implement the Article 6 Support Facility (\u201cthe support \nfacility\u201d).1 Through the support facility, ADB will provide capacity building, and technical and policy \ndevelopment support to developing member countries (DMCs) to help them to identify, develop, \nand pilot mitigation actions under the framework of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2018-2019 Work Plan of the Climate Change and Disaster Risk \nManagement Thematic Group approved by Management.2 It supports the operational priorities of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability.3 The TA is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Climate Change \nOperational Framework 2017\u20132030,4 which strengthens ADB support to DMCs in meeting their \ncommitments under the Paris Agreement, including nationally determined contributions (NDCs).5 \n \n3.  The support facility will be part of ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Program (CMP).6 Established in \n2006,  the  CMP  provides  technical  support  and  carbon  finance  to  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) \nmitigation projects in DMCs, including supporting DMCs to use market-based approaches as part \nof achieving their NDCs.7 It aims to build on the assistance provided to date, while responding to \nthe  ongoing  negotiations  and  developments  regarding  the  operationalization  of  the  Paris \nAgreement. ADB designed the TA on the strength of its carbon market institutional expertise and \nlessons learned through the CMP. The TA will allow ADB to continue to play a leadership role in \nthe development of post-2020 carbon markets.   \n \n4.  ADB has developed the TA in consultation with The Government of Germany through The \nFederal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety of Germany, and \nthe Swedish Energy Agency. The design of the TA has been informed by both countries\u2019 programs \nfor supporting pilot mitigation actions under the framework of Article 6. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n  \n5.  The Paris Agreement sets out the long-term goals for all countries8 to limit the global \ntemperature increase to well below 2oC, while pursuing a 1.5oC target. It requires all countries to \ncontribute  through  their  NDCs,  which  set  out  their  national  post-2020  climate  targets  and \ncommitments.  As  of  August  2018,  174 parties,  including  most  of  ADB\u2019s  DMCs,  have \ncommunicated their first NDCs. However, the collective ambitions are not sufficient to meet the \n                                                \n1   Article 6 of the Paris Agreement enables countries to cooperate voluntarily in implementing their nationally \ndetermined contributions (NDCs) through market and nonmarket-based approaches. The TA focuses on market-\nbased approaches. Mitigation actions in this report refer to cooperative approaches under Article 6.2 and the new \nmechanism under Article 6.4.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 November 2018. \n3  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n4  ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n5  NDCs outline countries\u2019 efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Paris Agreement \n(Article 4, para. 2) requires each party to prepare, communicate, and maintain successive NDCs. United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement and Nationally Determined Contributions. \n6  The CMP was then called the Carbon Market Initiative.  \n7  The CMP includes the (i) Future Carbon Fund, (ii) Technical Support Facility, and (iii) Japan Fund for the Joint \nCrediting Mechanism. It previously included the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund, which is now closed. \n8  Refers to the states and regional economic integration organizations that are parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. \n ", "2 \nParis Agreement goals, and efforts are needed by all countries to raise ambitions.9 \n \n6.  Article  6  of  the  Paris  Agreement  enables  countries  to  cooperate  voluntarily  in \nimplementing their NDCs through market and nonmarket-based approaches. Article 6 could help \ncountries access cost-effective mitigation opportunities and additional climate finance streams \nthrough cooperation, and form the basis for raising their ambitions over time. The market-based \napproaches in Article 6 include cooperative approaches under Article 6.2 and a new mitigation \nand sustainable development mechanism under Article 6.4.10 These lay the foundation for post-\n2020 carbon markets under the Paris Agreement by allowing countries to use mitigation outcomes \nfrom another country toward their NDCs.  \n \n7.  DMCs are developing and implementing national climate plans and policies to support \nNDC implementation. Almost all DMCs have provided commitments in their NDCs that are \nconditional (fully or partially) on international support. Cooperation under Article 6 could provide \npart of this support. Many DMCs have expressed their willingness to use market approaches as \na key tool for NDC implementation and are working to understand how to engage under Article 6. \nFor example, Pakistan and Thailand have indicated that they will consider the use of international \ncooperation, and India and Viet Nam have indicated that they will use market mechanisms to \nachieve their NDCs. The Republic of Korea states that it will partly use international market \nmechanisms to achieve its 2030 mitigation target, while Bangladesh does not rule out the use of \nmarket-based mechanisms.11 \n \n8.  To  engage  under  Article  6,  DMCs  must  understand  the  specific  requirements  and \nassociated accounting systems that they will need to manage participation. The Paris Agreement \nrequires countries that engage under Article 6 to promote sustainable development and ensure \nenvironmental integrity, transparency, and robust accounting. DMCs need to understand what \nthis means in practice. The rules for the implementation of Article 6 are expected to be adopted \nat the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties 24 in December 2018. However, the \nnegotiations and elaboration of many issues are likely to continue well beyond 2018, creating \nchallenges for DMCs. \n \n9.  The DMCs have growing momentum to undertake pilot activities under Article 6.12 Pilot \nactivities will play a critical role in building the capacity of DMCs to assess the use of cooperative \napproaches and the new 6.4 mechanism; contribute practical insights on how mitigation actions \ncan be designed and implemented, including encouraging innovation, upscaled action, policy \nreform, and the use of climate-friendly technologies; help DMCs begin to develop the institutional \ncapacity and systems needed; and help DMCs begin to engage the private sector in mitigation \nactions under Article 6. Pilot activities could also demonstrate how Article 6 could support \nactivities outside the scope of an NDC, with a view to incorporating the activities in the conditional \npart of the NDC over time. The lessons from pilot activities will strengthen DMCs\u2019 ability as \nimportant stakeholders in the negotiations on the implementation of the Paris Agreement.  \n \n10.  International market-based cooperation is crucial for promoting the cost-effectiveness and \nflexibility of mitigation action, and pilot activities undertaken by DMCs will highlight potential future \n                                                \n9  United Nations Environment Programme. 2017.

Pledges in current NDCs \nwill only achieve one-third of the emission reductions necessary by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement goals. \nCountries will revisit their NDCs by 2020 with the expectation that successive NDCs present an increase in ambition. \n10 The mechanism will operate under the authority of the Conference of the Parties.  \n11 United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. 2017.

The development of carbon markets under Article 6 is \nexpected to lead to an inflow of carbon finance to Asia and the Pacific, stimulating mitigation \nactivities and incentivizing the application of low-carbon technologies and the development of \ntechnical expertise to DMCs. This will likely lead to further opportunities for ADB to support \nupscaled mitigation actions in sectors such as low-carbon transport, renewable energy, and \nenergy efficiency. The development of post-2020 carbon markets will also help ADB meet its \noperational targets by generating demand for low-carbon, climate-friendly projects and enhancing \nthe internal rate of return for such projects. It will also present opportunities for ADB to cooperate \nwith its international development partners in providing carbon finance and other cofinancing \nsupport enabling knowledge support for green growth in the region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: low-carbon development in Asia and the \nPacific accelerated (footnote 3). The TA will have the following outcome: Article 6 Support Facility \noperationalized.13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  ADB proposes to establish the Article 6 Support Facility under the CMP. Through the \nsupport facility, ADB will provide capacity building, and technical and policy development support \nto DMCs to help them to identify, develop, and pilot mitigation actions including activities related \nto cooperative approaches involving international transfers of mitigation outcomes in the context \nof Article 6.2 and under the new mechanism under Article 6.4.14 ADB will encourage innovation \nin the development of mitigation actions in DMCs, contribute to achieving a critical mass of \nexpertise  on  Article  6,  draw  lessons  learned  from  pilot  activities,  and  enhance  DMCs\u2019 \npreparedness for participation in post-2020 markets as well as their ability to contribute to \ninternational negotiations.   \n \n13.  The TA team will work with ADB operations departments to build knowledge and capacity \nfor mitigation actions under Article 6, and encourage consideration of Article 6 in ADB\u2019s financing \noperations to enhance the opportunities for DMCs. The TA team will also coordinate with and \nmaximize the synergies with ADB\u2019s other initiatives and programs. \n \n14.  Output  1:  Capacity  of  developing  member  countries  to  identify  and  assess \nmitigation actions under Article 6 enhanced. This output entails providing support to DMCs to \nunderstand the opportunities and identify options for using cooperative approaches involving \ninternational transfers of mitigation outcomes and the new mechanism under Article 6 in achieving \nand enhancing their current and future NDCs. This includes supporting DMCs to consider \nactivities beyond the scope of their current NDCs with a view to incorporating the activities in the \nconditional part of the NDCs. The TA will provide capacity building, and technical and policy \ndevelopment support to DMC governments, and undertake capacity development activities (such \nas workshops and publication of knowledge products) on key topics such as: identifying and \ndesigning policy measures (e.g., carbon pricing, where international cooperation can scale up \nand/or accelerate mitigation actions); developing appropriate institutional structures to manage \n                                                \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 This will support DMCs to use carbon markets and climate finance under the framework of Article 6 towards reaching \nnational climate targets in their NDCs and to consider raising ambition.  \n ", "4 \nparticipation under Article 6; facilitating private and public sector involvement in mitigation actions; \noperationalizing environmental integrity in mitigation actions; designing and executing mitigation \nactions  for  generating  internationally  transferable  mitigation  outcomes  under  Article  6;  and \nintegrating sustainable development benefits into mitigation actions.15 ADB will assist at least two \nDMCs under output 1. Consultations with DMCs on the scope of support are ongoing (footnote \n12). \n \n15.  Output 2: Capacity of developing member countries to pilot mitigation actions \nunder Article 6 enhanced. This output involves the following activities:  \n \n(i)  The TA team will support DMCs to identify and evaluate options for pilot mitigation \nactions under Article 6.2 and 6.4, considering: the DMC\u2019s national climate plans \nand policies; the scope of their current NDC; environmental integrity; transparency; \nthe mitigation action implementation timeline; the potential scale and type of \nemission reductions; potential transaction models for the mitigation outcomes; and \nthe potential contribution of the mitigation action to sustainable development in the \nnational context, including through the delivery of co-benefits. The TA team will \nconsult  with  ADB  operations  departments  and  support  DMCs  to  target  pilot \nactivities  in  sectors  with  high  potential  for  demonstrative  effect  and \ntransformational change such as the energy and sustainable urban development \nsectors.16  \n(ii)  The TA team will provide technical support to the activity implementers to pilot \nmitigation actions to: define the scope of the mitigation actions; develop and \nimplement baseline and monitoring, reporting, and verification methodologies; and \nundertake necessary steps, to the extent possible, to qualify under Article 6. ADB \nwill assist at least three pilot mitigation actions under output 2.17 \n \n16.  Output 3: Capacity of developing member countries to undertake robust accounting \nand reporting of mitigation outcomes strengthened. Under this output, the TA team will work \nwith DMCs to strengthen their capacity, systems, and infrastructure for: robust accounting of \nmitigation outcomes; ensuring environmental integrity; and reporting on the issuance, transfer, \nand retirement of mitigation outcomes. This includes monitoring, reporting, and verification of \nmitigation actions and corresponding adjustments as required under the Article 6 provisions in \nthe Paris Agreement Rulebook. ADB will assist at least two DMCs under output 3. Consultations \nwith DMCs regarding the scope of support are ongoing (footnote 12). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $4,000,000, of which (i) $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources); (ii) $1,500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by The Government of Germany through The Federal Ministry for the \nEnvironment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety of Germany and administered by ADB; \nand (iii) $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Swedish Energy Agency and \nadministered by ADB.18 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n15 The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) and its 17 Sustainable Development \nGoals and the Paris Agreement are viewed as complementary mutually reinforcing instruments. The support facility \nwill support DMCs to integrate the Sustainable Development Goals into Article 6 activities. \n16 The TA team will review projects and programs that are being considered for financing by the ADB.  \n17 Consultations with ADB operational departments in regard to identifying potential mitigation activities are ongoing. \n18 Discussions with both donors on their respective cofinancing agreements are currently underway. \n ", "5 \nD.
