INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) has been in consultation with the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  collaborate  on  a  feasibility  study  of  different  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) applications for Pacific developing member countries (DMCs), \nincluding regional infrastructure options. The proposed regional policy and advisory technical \nassistance (TA) for the study came out of a series of dialogues between ADB and SPC, as well \nas  internal  consultations  among  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Cofinancing  Operations,  Regional  and \nSustainable Development Department, and Pacific Department. The TA concept was reviewed \nby the Government of the Republic of Korea and accepted for financing by the Republic of \nKorea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund.  The  major  agreements  reached  on  the \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, and financing plan of the TA are reflected in \nthis paper.1 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The rapid expansion of ICT and broadband infrastructure has increased efficiency and \nglobal productivity. ICT expansion has brought an increase in business and job opportunities, as \nwell as greater outreach and delivery of education and other social services. As part of the \nPacific Plan,2 the Pacific Regional Digital Strategy fully recognizes the important role of ICT in \nregional  development.  A  Pacific  ICT  Ministerial  Forum  meeting  in  March  2006  endorsed \nregional ICT priorities as (i) improving access to communication technologies through both \ncable and satellite technologies, (ii) reducing ICT costs, (iii) providing more bandwidth to the \nglobal  ICT  backbone  technology,  and  (iv)  strengthening  ICT  skills.  These  priorities  were \nreconfirmed at the Pacific ICT Ministerial Forum (Connect the Unconnected) in February 2009.  \n \n3.  Compared with the rest of the world, the Pacific has fallen behind in ICT infrastructure \nand application. The greatest concern in the Pacific is low-capacity and high-cost connections \nvia satellite. Among the Pacific DMCs, only the Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea have access \nto transpacific terrestrial cables. Satellite has been the main bandwidth provider since the 1970s, \nalbeit at high prices that most people in the Pacific cannot afford. The situation will change soon \nas  several  private  sector  initiatives  provide  subregional  connectivity.3 In  addition,  some \ninnovative experiments in the region have been able to demonstrate that ICT services can be \nmade accessible even in remote rural areas and outer islands.4 SPC requested ADB assistance \nfor Pacific DMCs that are invited to join the South Pacific Islands Network Project in assessing \ndifferent options for regional backbone network and in-country facilities. This will provide an \nopportunity  for  ADB  and  other  development  partners  to  consider  infrastructure  investment \ncomplementing private sector initiatives. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 July 2009.  \n2  Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2005. The Pacific Plan. Suva. \n3  The Northern Pacific Submarine Cable will connect the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia to \nGuam with a fiber-optic cable in 2010. Proposed by a New Caledonia-based company, the South Pacific Islands \nNetwork will connect the South Pacific francophone countries (which are not ADB Pacific DMCs) and possibly \ninclude  the  Cook  Islands,  the  Fiji  Islands,  Samoa,  Tonga,  and  Vanuatu  with  submarine  fiber-optic  cable \nconnections once these Pacific DMCs develop financing plans and business models by mid-2010. O3b Networks, \naimed at connecting the \u201cother 3 billion\u201d people in the developing world through low-orbit satellite communications, \nwill launch its service in late 2010. It has already formed partnerships in Africa to provide telecommunications \noperators and internet service providers with a low-cost, high-speed alternative to their 3G, WiMAX, and fixed-line \nnetworks to connect with the rest of the world.  \n4  Examples  include  the  Pacific  Rural  Internet  Connectivity  System  supported  by  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development, the Connecting Villages initiative using Nokia Siemens technology by the International \nTelecommunication Union, and the Pacific Telecentre Online Community.    \n ", "2   \n \n4.  The mere presence and availability of connectivity is not, however, sufficient to realize \nthe full benefits of ICT. Education and health services can be improved, in terms of both access \nand quality, and business has expanded with the enhanced availability of ICT. It remains largely \nunknown, though, how the Pacific may more efficiently realize the benefits of ICT, especially in \nthe pursuit of socially inclusive growth and poverty reduction.   \n \n5.  In the Pacific, poverty or hardship is described as lack of access to (i) income-generating \nopportunities; and (ii) social services, especially primary education and health care.5 ICT could \ndirectly generate income in only a few areas like call centers, considering the disadvantages of \nthe Pacific DMCs stemming from geography and small populations. Indirectly, it could open up \nnew  opportunities  through  improved  market  information,  which  may  create  new  jobs  and \nmarkets.  Savings  in  communication  costs  will  contribute  to  the  efficiency  of  Pacific  DMC \neconomies.  Considering  that  many  people  in  the  Pacific  rely  on  remittances,  better \ncommunication services, possibly backed up by technological solutions such as mobile banking, \nwill allow more secured transfers of remittances. There is significant potential for ICT to address \nthe challenge of the 'tyranny of distance' in the Pacific and strengthen virtual connectivity.  \n \n6.  More opportunities for the poor and people in remote areas lie in improved access to \npublic services. Governments face great challenges in providing basic services to outer islands, \nand this can be dramatically improved through ICT. Especially, ICT-supported education can \nimprove access to, and the quality of, education and prepare a workforce ready for the global \neconomy. Disaster management is another area where ICT can contribute. In addition to an \nICT-based  early  warning  system,  reliable  communication  is  essential  for  fast,  coordinated \nresponse. Demand for ICT in disaster management among Pacific DMCs is growing.  \n \n7.  Affordability and sustainability are particular concerns for the Pacific. Experience in \ndeveloping countries indicates that shared access successfully aggregates demand and shares \ncost. For communication services, this would be the solution. Cross subsidy and universal \nservice obligation can be employed to expand coverage to unserved areas affordably. For other \nservices such as education, health, and e-government, it is difficult to recover the cost from user \nfees.  As  governments  are  responsible  for  providing  these  services,  governments  should \neventually cover their costs, with only marginal charges to users.  \n \n8.  Such  benefits  can  be  realized  only  with  strong  stakeholder  commitment  and  good \nprogramming of technological and human capacity and institutional resources. Since 2000, \nADB's assistance for ICT in the Pacific has included (i) ICT readiness assessment and national \nICT strategy; (ii) piloting ICT access point and service delivery in remote communities; and \n(iii) ICT applications for education, health, and financial management. Across all assistance, \nstakeholders\u2019 understanding of the benefits of ICT is identified as the key to ownership and \nsuccess. The recent assessment of ADB's assistance in ICT highlights \"the need for taking \ngovernment-supported and demand-driven approaches for ICT projects\" and \"the demand and \nincentive structure of organizations and stakeholders,\" which concur with lessons from other \norganizations.6  \n \n9.  A thorough analysis of increased access to ICT infrastructure will help maximize the \nbenefits from it. The analysis should examine the types of ICT services that are capable of \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002\u20132003.

It will help stakeholders identify areas in which \ncatalytic investment would ensure better utilization of the planned connectivity infrastructure in \nthe interests of people currently unserved. It will inform discussions among governments, the \nprivate sector, and donors about demand and incentive structures to encourage more ICT use \nfor inclusive growth and poverty reduction.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The TA will enable SPC to better assist Pacific DMCs in assessing options for accessing \nregional  connectivity  infrastructure,  making  informed  choices,  and  preparing  investment \nproposals. The TA will explore appropriate and innovative ICT services and applications to help \nPacific DMCs promote inclusive growth and poverty reduction.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA impact is improved access of the poor and low income groups to ICT and extend \nits reach to remote areas. The TA outcome is the realization of investment in ICT applications \nand services for the poor and low income groups and in remote areas. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  This TA comprises two sets of outputs to be achieved through two phases over 12 \nmonths.  \n \n13.  The first phase will (i) help selected Pacific DMCs develop financing plans and business \nmodels to enable their participation in the regional backbone initiative;7 and (ii) conduct a \nthorough assessment of the existing and proposed ICT initiatives and applications to identify \nmodels and opportunities, constraints and gaps, and appropriate actions to identify how the \npeople of the Pacific, especially the poor, disadvantaged, small and medium-size enterprises, \nand remote outer island and rural populations can benefit from ICT services. It will draw on \ninternational best practices and lessons from ADB and other partners' ICT interventions in \ngeneral and account for the special conditions that affect ICT application in the Pacific. The \nparticular needs of businesses and the potential to enhance the delivery of essential public \nservices will be considered. Priority areas will be confirmed through consultations with Pacific \nDMCs and development partners. Relevant regulatory issues will be identified. Potential ICT \ninterventions and useful resources identified through the assessment will be catalogued at the \nSPC website for wider dissemination. The results of the study will be disseminated through a \nregional workshop.   \n \n14.  Based on the outcomes of the first phase, the second phase will assess possible ICT \ninvestments in selected Pacific DMCs. Institutional set-up and regulatory-reform needs will be \nassessed. A matrix of potential interventions will be developed, with three to five priority areas \nidentified for in-depth consultation with partners and feasibility studies. The criteria for selection \nwill include (i) the potential impact on growth and poverty reduction by reducing the cost of \nservice access or use, (ii) proven demand, (iii) interest from governments and the private sector, \nand (iv) the ease of developing feasible models for public\u2013private partnership or private sector \n                                                 \n7  Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands and Tonga will be prioritized in \nthe TA on the bases of opportunities from regional infrastructure development and existing initiatives. The selected \nPacific DMCs have different regulatory environments that can inform the TA on different regulatory reform options.  \n ", "4   \ninitiatives. Subject to partner commitment, one to two priority areas will be further developed into \ninvestment projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $590,000 equivalent. The Pacific DMCs of SPC \nmember countries have requested ADB to finance $570,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed \nas a grant from the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and ADB. The \nSPC will finance the balance of $20,000 equivalent through administrative and logistical support, \nstaff time, and other in-kind contributions. Cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix \n2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency, and the Pacific Department will be the focal point for \nTA management. SPC will assume the role of Implementing Agency by hosting the consultant \nteam in its new ICT unit and providing coordination support.  \n \n17.  The TA will require 10.5 person-months of international consultancy (4.5 person-months \nfor phase 1 and 6 person-months for phase 2), and 7 person-months of national consultancy (2 \nperson-months for phase 1 and 5 person-months for phase 2). Individual consultants will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. All \nprocurement of equipment will be done in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). An advance payment facility will be established to allow \nSPC to organize a regional workshop. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance \nwith ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.8 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $70,000 on a grant basis for \nInformation and Communication Technology-Based Inclusive Growth and Poverty Reduction in \nthe Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2008.
