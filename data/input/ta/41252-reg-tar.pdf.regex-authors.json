There is increasing evidence that out-of-pocket expenses act as a financial barrier to \nessential health care, are a source of impoverishment, and can exacerbate inequity.1 This is \nespecially true in Asia where out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE)2 plays such a dominant role in \nhealth care payments. The adverse effects of OOPE are also particularly noticeable when it \ncomes to maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH), where medical expenses can be large, \nsudden, and unexpected. Many Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member countries \n(DMCs) therefore wish to better understand the impact that OOPE\u2014especially for MNCH\u2014has \non household expenditure patterns, poverty, and inequity. There are, however, gaps in the \nanalysis at country level in many DMCs, and little comparable analysis at a regional level. Better \ndata and insights would therefore help DMCs identify the scale and intensity of the problem, the \npossible policy responses, and the likely budgetary implications for improving equity and access \nto essential health care for poor women and their children. Development partners are also \ninterested in such better data and analysis for the same reasons. The newly formed\u2014and \ninfluential\u2014Maternal,  Newborn,  and  Child  Health  Network  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific3  has \nspecifically asked that ADB undertake analytical work on this issue.  \n \n2.  ADB has been asked to undertake this knowledge product for three main reasons. First, \nADB has the capacity to take a genuinely regional approach. Second, this proposed technical \nassistance (TA) draws on ADB\u2019s comparative advantage in economic analysis, and builds on \nrecent analytical work in this field.4 Third, ADB has taken quite a prominent role in the writing of \nan investment case for MNCH in Asia and the Pacific, where issues of finance, equity, and \npublic expenditure management are prominent. As such, the study would clearly be consistent \nwith the directions set under ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020),5 \ngiven  the  focus  on  poverty  reduction,  financing,  social  inclusion,  and  public  expenditure \nmanagement.6 Given its interest in MNCH in Asia and the Pacific, the Government of Australia, \nthrough AusAID, has offered to cofinance this study.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Health\u2014A Development Issue. Health is central to development. For individuals, poor \nhealth undermines education and income opportunities. Ill health means loss of income and \n                                                 \n1  Xu, K. et al. 2007. Protecting Households From Catastrophic Health Spending.

The organizations \nrepresented include those from the United Nations (The Partnership on Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health, \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund [UNICEF], United Nations Population Fund, World Health Organization [WHO]), \nnational  development  agencies  (AusAID,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom, Japan International Cooperation Agency, United States Agency \nfor International Development), multilateral development banks (ADB and the World Bank), and the Bill and \nMelinda Gates Foundation. \n4  For example: Bonu, S., I.

Indeed, after illiteracy \nand unemployment, health costs are the most important precursor to poverty.7 Health is a \ncritical development issue at the national level; 30%\u201350% of Asia\u2019s economic growth between \n1965 and 1990 can be attributed to favorable demographic and health changes.8 The United \nStates Agency for International Development estimates that maternal and newborn mortality \naccounts  for  $15  billion  in  lost  potential  production  globally  every  year.  Maternal  mortality \nadversely affects the welfare of surviving children. Maternal morbidity affects basic wellbeing \nand economic productivity. Not surprisingly, three of the seven Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) explicitly target health,9 and those three interact with MDG 1 (poverty reduction). \n \n4.  Distinctive  Level  and  Pattern  of  Health  Expenditure.  Appendix  2  reveals  three \nimportant facts about expenditure on health in Asia and the Pacific. First, total expenditure on \nhealth is low, with per capita expenditure lower in South Asia than even sub-Saharan Africa. \nSecond, private expenditure dominates in Asia, with government playing a relatively minor role. \nThird, out-of-pocket expenditure on health is much higher among DMCs in Asia and the Pacific \ncompared to Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.  \n \n5.  Effects on Poverty, Inequity, and Access. Several studies have found that \u201chealth \nshocks,\u201d and especially the high level of OOPE, increase poverty. Equity in Asia-Pacific Health \nSystems (EQUITAP) studied 11 countries in Asia and found that 78 million people fell below the \n$1.08 poverty line as a result of health payments.10 ADB analysis found that nearly 40 million \npeople in India were below the poverty line as a result of health payments.11 Others have \nestimated that nearly one-quarter of people admitted to hospitals in India were above the \npoverty line when they were admitted but were below it by the end of their stay because of \nhealth expenditure they incurred.12 Studies also show that high OOPE is also associated with \ncatastrophic expenditure13 that clearly serves to impoverish people. In summary, high rates of \nOOPE\u2014so common in Asia and the Pacific\u2014are regressive, can increase poverty, exacerbate \ninequity, increase household debt, and hinder access to essential health care.  \n \n6.  Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health. The adverse effects of OOPE are particularly \nsignificant when it comes to MNCH because such medical expenses can be large, sudden, and \nunexpected.14 In Bangladesh the total cost of health care during pregnancy, delivery, and the \npostpartum period amounted to an average 15% of annual income for those women delivering \nat home, rising to 35% in a basic obstetric facility, and to 452% of annual income for delivery in \na public comprehensive obstetric facility.15 Even a relatively small payment can mean either a \nfinancial barrier to essential care or a financial catastrophe to a poor person or household, \nforcing them to reduce spending on other basics such as food, shelter, or their children\u2019s \n                                                 \n7  See World Bank.

Health Financing Revisited. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n13  WHO defines catastrophic expenditure as health care payments reaching or exceeding 40% of a household\u2019s \ncapacity to pay in any one year. The household capacity to pay is, in turn, defined as its nonfood spending.   \n14  It  is  also  recognized  that  OOPE  is  also  often  high  for  other  health  events  such  as  traffic  accidents  and \nnoncommunicable diseases. However, for the reasons given in paras. 1, 2, and 7, this TA focuses on MNCH. \n15  Borghi, J. et al. 2006. Household Costs of Healthcare during Pregnancy, Delivery, and the Postpartum Period: A \nCase Study from Matlab, Bangladesh. Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition 24 (4) 446\u2013455. \n ", "4   \neducation. The most recent analysis by ADB finds that maternal health care expenditure was \ncatastrophic (exceeding more than 40% of capacity to pay) for virtually all households from the \npoorest decile in India. It is also apparent that MDG outcomes for MNCH can be achieved at the \nnational level for several DMCs in Asia, such as Viet Nam and the Philippines, but with little or \nno progress for the poorest quintile, thereby exacerbating inequity.    \n \n7.  Increasing  Interest.  DMCs are increasingly interested in knowing more about how \nOOPE affects equity, access to health services, and poverty.16 This is especially true when it \ncomes to expenditure on MNCH, because expenditure there affects so many households, and \nespecially the poor. Development partners are similarly showing a great deal more interest in \nthe analytical and policy implications of expenditure on MNCH. For example, the Maternal, \nNewborn, and Child Health Network for Asia and the Pacific has developed a strong investment \ncase for MNCH in Asia and the Pacific. There is now an active program of rolling out this \ninvestment case in Asia and the Pacific. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) has \ndone pre-investment analysis in 11 countries. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has joined \nwith AusAID to fund research that will help identify investments with the greatest impact and \ncost effectiveness, either on the demand or supply side, for MNCH interventions in Asia and the \nPacific. A coalition of Australian universities has been contracted to do this work. AusAID has \nalso provided a research grant of A$750,000, spread over 3 years, to the Institute for Health \nPolicy to research catastrophic and impoverishing health expenditure, with particular reference \nto MNCH. Funding constraints means that study will be limited to Cambodia, the Fiji Islands, the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, possibly the Solomon Islands, and Viet Nam, . Appendix 2 \nmaps these various initiatives. \n \n8.  Incomplete Information. Despite the importance and growing interest in these issues, \ngovernments and their development partners simply do not have enough up-to-date, reliable, \nand regionally comparable data and analysis on the implications of OOPE on MNCH. Even \nbasic information, such as the amount of OOPE being spent on MNCH, is not routinely captured \nin national health accounts or demographic and health surveys. While such information may \noften be captured in household surveys, the validity of such data is unclear. Even when the data \nis robust, the analytical work to drive policy responses\u2014such as the extent to which OOPE on \nMNCH  is  affordable,  causing  impoverishment,  or  resulting  in  catastrophic  expenditure\u2014is \nusually missing. Comparable data and analysis at a regional level is particularly needed but is \nespecially rare. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be a better and more reliable basis for policy making and resource \nallocation  decisions,  including  measures  to  protect  the  poor,  of  both  DMCs  and  their \ndevelopment partners when considering OOPE and MNCH. The outcome of the TA will be \nincreased recognition and evidence-based understanding of the interactions between OOPE, \nMNCH, and impoverishment.  \n \n10.  The proposed TA will have three benefits: \n(i)  DMCs  and  their  development  partners  will  know  how  much\u2014or  how  little\u2014\nreliance  they  can  put  on  their  existing  household  surveys  when  trying  to \n                                                 \n16 Pakistan, for example, has just commissioned a study on the role of OOPE on MNCH. They are keen to liaise with \nADB on this work. Viet Nam and Cambodia are also undertaking studies on the subject. \n ", "  5\nunderstand the impact of OOPE on MNCH. This in itself will be an important \ninsight for policy makers and planners in DMCs.  \n(ii)  Testing the reliability and comparability of the household surveys will inform and \nincrease the impact and usefulness of all the other analytical work being done in \nthis field (para. 7 and Appendix 2), both now and in the future.  \n(iii)  Where there are gaps in the quantity or quality of data, DMCs will be able to see \nwhat needs to be done to make their data sets consistent with others in Asia and \nthe Pacific, thereby being able to benchmark themselves.  \n \n11.  The proposed TA will be conducted in two phases.  The first phase will be to scope and \nvalidate the availability and reliability of household survey data as a basis for measuring the \neffect of OOPE and MNCH.  This phase also consist of a concise literature review of the latest \nmain  findings  related  to  OOPE  and  MNCH  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  and  a  summary  of \ninternational developments.  The second phase will be to then analyze and report on the \nrelationship between OOPE and MNCH for those countries which are found to have reliable \ndata.  The second phase will answer questions such as: What is the level of OOPE on MNCH in \nabsolute and relative terms? How much of such expenditure is catastrophic and how much is \nimpoverishing? What is the distribution of such expenditure by wealth quintiles? How much \nwould it cost per year at a national level for a government to defray catastrophic expenditure in \nits  society?  Where  data  sets  are  reliable  and  robust,  the  analysis  will  also  extend  to  a \nmultivariate analysis of those factors\u2014such as income levels, age, geographical location, and \nethnicity\u2014that predispose a household to catastrophic expenditures. The output of that second \nphase analysis will be a report providing an accurate, up-to-date, regionally comparable set of \nanalysis and insights on the affordability, impoverishment, and catastrophic effects of OOPE on \nMNCH for a range of countries in the region.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The first scoping phase involves identifying, collecting, and then testing the extent to \nwhich household survey data in this region gives reliable insights into OOPE for MNCH. The \nquickest and most cost-effective way to achieve that outcome is to have one international \nconsultancy team lead and coordinate liaison with the various national research institutions in a \nwide range of DMCs (Appendix 2). Field visits are likely to be required for Pakistan and Papua \nNew  Guinea,17  where  the  quality  of  data  sets  appears,  prima  facie,  to  be  particularly \nproblematic. For all other DMCs, electronic liaison with local counterparts will be sufficient. The \ninternational consultant will coordinate the comparability of overall findings and ensure quality \ncontrol. After recruitment in early March 2009, the international consultant will undertake the \nscoping phase in an estimated 3 months. The international consultant will then present a draft \nreport to ADB and AusAID in June 2009. This will be followed by a workshop in July to which \ninterested DMCs, academic institutions, research institutes, and other key stakeholders of the \nMaternal, Newborn, and Child Health Network for Asia and the Pacific will be invited. Such a \nworkshop will provide an opportunity for external review of the initial findings by the network and \nother stakeholders. It will also be timely as it will inform ongoing and future work in this area by \nADB, AusAID, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UNICEF, and the World Bank (see \nAppendix 2).  \n \n12.  In the light of that workshop, ADB and AusAID will then decide which narrower group of \ncountries will proceed to the next, more intensive phase of detailed analysis. Such a choice will \n                                                 \n17  Field visits to Timor-Leste are also possible if it is decided to extend the study to that country. There is much merit \nin doing so but the availability of data means that still needs to be decided. \n ", "6   \ntake into account DMC interest, the breadth and depth of the problems identified, the desirability \nof complementing (but not duplicating) the analytical work of other development partners in this \nfield, and the overall budget. The terms of reference for the second phase will then be fine-\ntuned and negotiated accordingly, with an increasing emphasis on the policy implications for \nDMCs and development partners arising from the more detailed findings. Detailed analysis and \npossibly survey work will then occur from July 2009 until November 2009. A draft report will be \npresented to ADB and AusAID in December 2009. A final report will then be published as an \nofficial ADB document. It will be tabled and presented at a suitable high-level conference on \nMNCH, such as the proposed Regional Countdown Meeting for MNCH envisaged to take place \nin Asia in early 2010.18 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to cost $626,000 equivalent.  ADB will finance the \nequivalent of $300,000 as a grant from ADB\u2019s TA funding program and the equivalent of \n$326,000 will be cofinanced as a grant from the government of Australia through the Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID).    The  cofinancing  from  AusAID  will  be \nadministered by ADB.  Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Within ADB, the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department will implement the TA in close collaboration with the departments and \noffices concerned. The Government of Australia, as a cofinancier of the TA, will be part of the \nsteering  committee  that  will  liaise  electronically  through  emails  and  video  conferencing  to \nprovide  oversight  and  monitor  work  progress.  The  study  will  be  limited  to  five  countries: \nCambodia, the Fiji Islands, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, possibly the Solomon Islands, \nand Viet Nam.  International and national consultants will be engaged through an international \nfirm using quality-based selection procedures and simplified technical proposals. Quality-based \nselection is the appropriate selection method because the substantive content of phase 2 work \ncannot be determined with any certainty until after the phase 1 scoping study. Disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook.19   \n \n15.  It will be essential that the consultant has a high level of expertise and experience in \ncleaning, interrogating, and critically analyzing household survey data on health expenditure in a \nwide range of DMCs. The consultant must also have excellent networks and links to national \nresearch institutes in DMCs, and be able to coordinate and provide quality control over data  \nfrom a wide variety of national sources. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 4.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $326,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \n                                                 \n18 That is, a \u2018Countdown\u2019 on progress in reaching the MDGs by 2015. \n19  ADB. 2008.

International Consultant \n1.  Health Financing Specialist and Team Leader (6 person-months, intermittent, for phase \n1). The team leader will be a health financing specialist with in-depth knowledge of national health \naccounts in Asia and the Pacific. The team leader will also have demonstrated expertise in critically \nassessing the usefulness and usability of household survey data in developing countries in Asia \nand the Pacific, and drawing reliable and justified conclusions and inferences from them and \nsimilar data sets, especially with respect to health expenditure, equity, and poverty. The team \nleader will also act as principal supervisor and coordinator of inputs and reports, ensuring the \nquality and consistency of analysis and documentation.  \n2.  The consultant will undertake the following activities in phase 1: \n(i)  Lead  the  liaison  with  the  appropriate  national  agencies  or  research  institutes \nresponsible  for  household  survey  data  in  up  to  15  developing  countries \n(supplementary appendix 1) to determine what household survey data is available \nincluding its date, size and comprehensiveness, scope, and overall quality.   \n(ii)  In the case of Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, and (possibly) Timor-Leste, undertake \nfield visits to assess the availability and quality of data. In the case of Pakistan, \ndiscuss with the Ministry of Health in Punjab its proposed study on out-of-pocket \nexpenditure (OOPE) on maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) with a view to \nensuring compatibility and complementarity with their studies. \n(iii)  Lead and coordinate the identification of the extent to which such household survey \ndata in developing member countries (DMCs) or similar data sources and capture \nexpenditure on MNCH, especially OOPE on MNCH. \n(iv)  Lead and coordinate a critical assessment of the reliability of such survey data for \nunderstanding the nature and extent of OOPE on MNCH as a source of inequity, \ncatastrophic expenditure, or impoverishment. \n(v)  Lead the identification of what priority actions would be needed to make such \nhousehold survey data sets more reliable and comparable across Asia and the \nPacific. \n(vi)  Lead the identification of any preliminary conclusions that the survey data already \nreveals about the impact of OOPE on MNCH, including the extent to which it acts as \na barrier to essential care, increases inequity, or is catastrophic or impoverishing for \nthe households concerned.  \n(vii)  Recommend  which  countries  should  be  priorities  for  more  in-depth  analysis  in \nphase 2, taking into account the MNCH mortality and morbidity levels, poverty levels, \nand the extent and quality of survey data on which policy recommendations can \nthen be made. Recommend and justify what areas should receive priority attention \nfor follow-up analytical work in phase 2.  \n(viii)  Lead a desk review of the most important literature over the period of 2003 through \n2007 on the issue of OOPE and its relationship to inequity and impoverishment. \nWhile such a literature review should give strongest emphasis to Asia and the \nPacific, especially as it relates to MNCH, it should be anchored by comparison to \nfindings in other regions of the world. Include in that review insights and knowledge \nabout how international organizations, including the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) and research institutions, are approaching the \n ", "  Appendix 4  13 \nissue of OOPE for health care in Asia and the Pacific, especially as it relates to \nMNCH. Take into account recent research by ADB20 and other relevant articles.   \n(ix)  Lead, and provide editorial quality assurance for, a draft document report to ADB \nand the Government of Australia that analyzes and reports on the above-mentioned \nfindings, using the format in the supplementary appendix 1 as a guide. Finalize the \nreport in light of comments from ADB and the Government of Australia. \n(x)  Present  the  report  and  its  findings  to  a  workshop  involving  DMCs  and  invited \nmembers of the Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Network for Asia and the \nPacific. \n \n3.   The consultant will be expected to lead and provide quality assurance for more detailed \nanalytical work for a smaller number of high-priority countries in phase 2. That analytical work will \ninvolve data cleaning and then interrogation of data sets. Once the data has been cleaned the \nconsultant will lead a team that addresses the following questions: What is the level of OOPE on \nMNCH in absolute and relative terms? How much of such expenditure is catastrophic and how \nmuch is impoverishing? What is the distribution of such expenditure by wealth quintiles? How \nmuch would it cost a national government to defray catastrophic expenditure in its society per year? \nWhere data sets are reliable and robust, the analysis will also extend to a multivariate analysis of \nthose factors that predispose a household to catastrophic expenditure (e.g., income level, age, \ngeographical location, and ethnicity). What are the main policy and programming implications for \nDMCs? Are subsidies, conditional cash transfers, or insurance schemes appropriate responses to \nthe impoverishing effects of OOPE on MNCH? If so, what might be the budgetary implications for \ngovernments and their development partners? The exact nature of the research questions, and the \ncountries to be considered, will be decided by ADB and AusAID at the workshop at the end of \nphase 1.  \n \nB.   National Consultants (1 person-week per country)  \n \n4.  In order to support the work of the team leader, national consultants will be hired in each of \nthe DMCs to identify and provide the latest household survey data for each of those countries. The \nnational consultants are required to have expertise and familiarity with national health accounts \nand national household surveys. The number of national consultants required will depend upon the \nsize of the country, the availability of data, and its degree of complexity: one national consultant \nworking for 1 week will be sufficient for Timor-Leste, but two national consultants working for \n2.5 days each may be required for larger and more complex assignments such as in Pakistan or \nstates in India. The national consultants are required to have informed insights into the strengths \nand limitations of the household survey methodology, especially as it relates to drawing inferences \nabout OOPE and MNCH and its impact on poverty and inequity.   \n \n5.  The national consultants will undertake the following activities: \n(i)  Under the direction of the team leader, identify and provide information on the latest \nhousehold survey data, especially as it relates to OOPE on MNCH. They will also \nidentify other data sets that might be appropriate. \n(ii)  Provide  advice  and  insights  to  the  team  leader  on  the  strengths,  weaknesses, \nreliability, and robustness of such household survey data, especially as it relates to \nOOPE on MNCH. \n                                                 \n20 Bonu, S., I.
