", "  1\nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The ongoing global financial crisis has exposed a remarkable degree of global financial \nintegration\u2014and its consequences\u2014for emerging East Asian financial markets.1 Since the 2007 \nUnited States (US) subprime mortgage market crash, violent swings in stock prices and visible \nspillover effects in emerging East Asia\u2019s economic and financial systems have made it clear that \nthis  region  is  not  insulated  from  major  economic  and  financial  market  developments  in \nindustrialized countries. Such vulnerability to direct and indirect shocks in emerging East Asia\u2019s \nfinancial  markets  and  systems  will  significantly  determine  the  future  course  of  financial \nintegration at both the regional and global levels.  \n \n2.  In  financial  crises,  one  frequently  asked  question is  whether  financial  integration  is \nultimately beneficial for economic growth. Financial integration among economies should, in \ntheory, offer benefits of risk sharing and foster economic development and growth. However, \nintensified financial links in a world of increased capital mobility may also increase the risk of \ncross-border financial contagion. For emerging East Asia, which has been actively pursuing \nregional financial integration, its situation creates even more questions. Are there additional \nbenefits or costs of regional financial integration beyond financial globalization? Would the \nprogress  of  regional  financial  integration  complement,  substitute,  or  conflict  with  financial \nglobalization? Are there different factors driving regional financial integration vis-\u00e0-vis financial \nglobalization? What lessons can the region's policy makers draw from the post-crisis experience \nof financial deregulation and liberalization to determine the future course of financial integration \nfor their economies? Therefore, an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary nature of financial \nintegration,  at  both  the  regional  and  global  levels,  will  increase  understanding  of  financial \nintegration and offer developing member countries valuable lessons in forming their plans and \nstrategies for their capital market development. \n \n3.  The current global financial crisis presents a timely opportunity for the region\u2019s policy \nmakers to rethink their strategies for financial deregulation and liberalization and to reconsider a \nnext step to integrate emerging East Asia\u2019s financial markets further. While substantial literature \nalready  exists  under  the  separate  subjects  of  financial  globalization  and  regional  financial \nintegration, little research has been done on the dynamics between these two distinctive forces. \nThis technical assistance (TA) project will assess the progress of regional financial integration \nvis-\u00e0-vis financial globalization and offer insights for future strategic planning.2 The design and \nmonitoring framework for this TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The current crisis illustrates how closely the global financial markets are connected and \ntheir roles in propagating a shock. Although the origin of the crisis can be traced to the US \nsubprime mortgage market, its impact has been shared globally. While Asian banks were \nrelatively shielded from the immediate losses from US subprime mortgages and related credit \nderivatives  markets,  the  subsequent  retrenchment  in  interbank  lending  and  investors'  risk \nappetite was felt globally, overtaking emerging Asian markets.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The 10 largest emerging East Asian economies are the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; \nthe Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam. \n2  The TA concept paper was cleared on 23 October 2008. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities \nsection of ADB's website on 8 January 2009.  ", "2  \n5.  Emerging East Asia's economic and financial integration has gained momentum since \nthe 1990s. Although the region's real economic integration has been facilitated by national and \nregional policies for trade and investment liberalization, its financial integration has lagged. \nThus,  when  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  adopted  its  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration strategy in 2006, promoting monetary and financial integration became a focus of \nfurthering regional cooperation and integration. ADB's long-term strategic framework (Strategy \n2020)3 also identifies regional cooperation and financial sector development as core operations. \n \n6.  Financial integration is a dynamic and multifaceted process. Advances in information \nand  communication  technology  and  the  removal  of  barriers  to  cross-border  activity  have \nexpedited  financial  market  integration  globally.  At  the  regional  level,  policy  makers  have \npromoted  financial  integration  since  the  1997/98  Asian  financial  crisis.  However,  evidence \nsuggests that the region's financial markets are integrated more with global markets than with \neach other. Moreover, factors driving regional financial integration are not fully understood, \nparticularly regarding how they differ from the factors behind financial globalization and whether \npolicy efforts to promote regional integration complement or conflict with policies to enhance \nfinancial stability.  \n \n7.  Although  promoting  market  integration  and  financial  efficiency,  financial  innovation \ncontributed to the current crisis by compromising regulators\u2019 ability to assess underlying risks \nand by providing the link for massive financial contagion. Rapid growth in financial innovation, \nalong with the trend of financial deregulation, led to the proliferation of complex structured \nproducts,  which  then  facilitated  this  financial  intermediation  by  helping  global  financial \ninstitutions bundle, repackage, and sell subprime mortgages to a broad spectrum of investor \ngroups.  \n \n8.  The  degree  of  financial  openness  was  also  an  important  element  for  the  financial \ncontagion. The most affected countries include those with high foreign participation in local \nequity markets, banking systems that depend heavily on short-term foreign currency funding, \nand those running external current account deficits. Volatility in foreign portfolio investment \nflows\u2014short-term  funds  placed  in  stocks,  bonds,  and  banks'  overseas  borrowing\u2014also \npresented a significant risk. Exposures to short-term external funds have badly affected the \nperformance  of  the  region\u2019s  currencies  amid  greater  uncertainty  about  the  continuity  and \nstability of these foreign currency funds.  \n \n9.  In the past, financial liberalization and deregulation often preceded financial disruptions \nin  emerging  market  economies.  Large  capital  inflows  drawn  to  their  relatively  high  growth \npotentials usually led to rapid credit growth, asset bubbles, and imprudent lending practices. As \nseen in the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, high levels of foreign currency debt, overvalued \ncurrencies, low levels of foreign currency reserves, lack of prudential oversight, and weak \nfinancial institutions turned out to be a volatile combination. \n \n10.  Since  the  1997/98  crisis,  emerging  East  Asian  economies  have  rectified  their \nmacroeconomic imbalances, bolstered their external positions, and addressed their structural \nweaknesses almost uniformly. Recognizing the institutional and structural weaknesses in their \nlargely bank-dominated financial systems, regional economies have also directed substantial \nefforts toward developing and deepening their capital markets. However, unlike the 1997/98 \ncrisis that reflected the region's own fundamental imbalances and structural weaknesses, the \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. ", "3 \nroot cause of the current crisis can be found in global financial imbalances. The US\u2019s chronic \naccount deficits and large capital inflows to finance these deficits were facilitated by rapid \nfinancial integration. Due to growing financial globalization, the US economy was able to attract \nmassive capital to fill the large gap between its investments and savings. Emerging East Asia \nprovided much of that needed capital thanks to an inadequate supply of regional financial \nproducts and services in the region.  \n \n11.  Regional financial integration can help the region promote the development of national \nand regional financial markets, encourage market infrastructure investment, and harmonize the \nregulatory environment\u2014which will ultimately contribute to the efficiency of financial resources \nallocation in the region. However, it is not yet clear if regional financial integration is without \nrisks nor what additionality it can bring beyond the costs and benefits of the region's financial \nintegration with global markets. \n \n12.  The region's policy makers currently face the challenge of balancing regional integration \nand financial globalization to maximize the benefits of financial integration while minimizing its \npotential risks. The current crisis should not deter the progress that the region has made toward \nfinancial openness and integration because it created transmission channels for a financial \ncrisis.  However,  with  financial  markets  becoming  increasingly  integrated,  it  is  important  to \nreassess the stage of both global and regional financial integration and carefully reset the path \nand pace of future integration. As the past and present crises highlighted, mismanagement of \nfinancial globalization often leaves emerging market economies\u2014with weak fundamentals and \nunderdeveloped  financial  systems\u2014vulnerable  to  external  adversities.  Regional  financial \nintegration,  which  is  thought  to  eventually  benefit  regional  economies  by  helping  mobilize \nregional savings for regional investments more effectively and efficiently, may or may not be \nparticularly useful or compatible with the efforts to enhance financial stability depending on the \ncountry-specific development stages and different requirements for openness. \n \n13.  Many studies have documented the progress of financial integration since the 1997 \ncrisis  and  recognized  its  benefits.  Three  major  studies  include  (i)  Monetary  and  Financial \nIntegration in East Asia in 2004 implemented under the Study on Monetary and Financial \nCooperation in East Asia, (ii) Asian Economic Cooperation and Integration: Progress, Prospects \nand Challenges in 2005 under the High-Level Conference on Asia\u2019s Economic Cooperation and \nIntegration, and (iii) Emerging Asian Regionalism: A Partnership of Shared Prosperity in 2008 \nunder Emerging Asian Regionalism: Ten Years After the Crisis.4 Most recently, another TA on \nQuantifying the Costs and Benefits of Regional Economic Integration5 has been approved to \nestimate the costs and benefits of regional economic integration to help the region\u2019s policy \nmakers make more informed decisions in regional integration efforts.  \n \n14.  However, these studies omit an in-depth analysis of the evolution of financial integration, \nwhich would increase understanding of the core aspects of Asian financial integration and offer \nvaluable lessons in forming plans and strategies for the future course of regional financial \nintegration. This will also complement the ongoing TA project on quantifying the costs and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  This TA project aims to study the current stage of both regional and global financial \nintegration in emerging East Asia. It will also analyze factors behind the progress of regional \nfinancial integration in relation to financial globalization to identify policy challenges in pursuing \nfurther integration while enhancing financial resilience in the region. \n \n16.  Findings of the study will provide reliable estimates for assessing the degree of regional \nversus global financial integration. In doing so, this can help measure the effect of financial \ntransmissions at both regional and global levels. Amid continued financial turbulence, having \nmore accurate empirical estimates of the extent of financial globalization and regional financial \nintegration in Asia will help gauge how resilient emerging East Asia\u2019s financial systems are to \nglobal turmoil. But more importantly, this study will enhance understanding of the dynamics of \nfinancial integration at the regional level amid the strong trend of financial globalization. And its \nfindings will provide a practical reference for policy makers in formulating their financial market \ndevelopment plans.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n17.  A book will be published, composed of chapters drawn from a collection of rigorous \nbackground papers suitable for journal publication. The book will comprise three major sections. \nThe  first  section  will  empirically  measure  the  degree  of  regional  versus  global  financial \nintegration and document the progress of regional financial integration in emerging East Asia \namid the rapidly globalizing financial landscape.7 The second section will compile studies on the \ndynamics and interaction between regional financial integration and financial globalization, and \nanalyze the driving factors behind these two distinct forces of financial integration. The third \nsection will provide the policy implications of findings from the first two sections, including the \nbenefits, if any, of taking a regional approach to financial market integration over a global \napproach.  \n \n18.  To the extent possible, each paper will draw on past ADB research and avoid duplication \nwith  existing  papers.  The  methodology  section  will  clearly  explain  the  assumptions  and \nestimation  techniques  employed  to  facilitate  independent  replication  and  verification.  A \nsummary of the findings will be reflected in an overview chapter. Preliminary findings will be \ndiscussed in midterm review seminars and the final results presented in a finalization workshop. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA project will cost an estimated $750,000 and be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program (TASF-IV). The detailed cost breakdown and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008.

", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Within ADB, the Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration will implement the TA in collaboration with concerned departments. The \nTA will require 14.5 person-months of international consulting services, 19.5 person-months of \nnational  consulting  services,  and  approximately  0.5  person-month  of  resource  persons\u2019 \nservices.  All  of  the  consultants  will  be  engaged  individually  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA is expected to be completed in 18 months, \nfrom March 2009 to September 2010.  \n21.  Seven  international  consultants  will  be  engaged  intermittently  for  a  total  of  12  \nperson-months to write background papers on the identified issues. The draft papers will be \ndiscussed in consecutive seminars, each of which will examine a section of the book. After \ngiving authors time to revise and incorporate comments from these seminars, the papers will be \npresented in a finalization workshop where resource persons will be invited to comment on the \ndifferent papers. Five resource persons will be invited to review the findings and serve as \ndiscussants  during  this  finalization  workshop.  Engagement  of  these  discussants  will  total \napproximately 0.5 person-month. Some background papers may be merged and developed into \nchapters by the lead consultant for each section. Given the independent nature of the studies \n(by area of expertise) and that the experience and qualification of the background writers are \nthe main consideration for their engagement, each will be hired as individual consultant. The \nOffice of Regional Economic Integration has available staff skilled in managing the multiple \ncontracts  of  background  writers.  One  or  two  economics  editor(s)  will  also  be  engaged \nintermittently, as international consultants, for a total of 2.5 person-months to serve as the \npublication's editor(s) as well as to assist in writing the book\u2019s overview chapter. ADB may \ncollaborate with international research organizations to ensure the quality of the papers to be \nincluded  in  the  book.  After  publication,  a  book  launch  will  be  organized  and  the  findings \ndisseminated through the Asia Regional Integration Center website, among others. \n \n22.  One national consultant will be engaged for 12.0 person-months to serve as project \ncoordinator for overall administration of the TA project. An events coordinator will be employed \nfor 3.0 person-months, intermittently, to serve as focal person for the conduct of the seminars, \nworkshop, and related activities. Once all the chapters of the book are complete, a copy editor \nwill  be  hired  for  2.5  person-months  and  a  typesetter  for  2.0  person-months  to  ensure  a  \nhigh-quality publication that adheres to ADB\u2019s style, usage, and format. Disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.8 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nGlobal and Regional Financial Market Integration, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2008.
