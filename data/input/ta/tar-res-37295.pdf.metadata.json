Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to agricultural research since 1975 has aimed to \nenhance  agricultural  productivity,  foster  sustainability  of  natural  resources,  improve  rural \nlivelihoods, and reduce poverty. In 1995, this support was translated into a policy document that \nreiterated the need to assist research in agriculture, particularly through the member centers of \nthe Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), as an important means of \nimproving Asia\u2019s agriculture, environment, and natural resources. The policy on agriculture and \nnatural resources research (ANRR)1 also recommended directly  channeling ADB support for \nANRR to the international agricultural research centers (IARCs) of the CGIAR through an annual \nregional technical assistance (RETA) modality. The ANRR RETA has been supporting a package \nof high-priority research proposals from the IARCs every year from 1996 and has so far provided \n$35.5 million of total assistance.  \n \n2.  In December 2000, ADB reviewed the ANRR policy of 1995 and evaluated the experience \nand impact of funding provided to the IARCs.2 The evaluation found the policy still relevant, the \nRETA modality effective, the research outputs relevant, and investment returns high; it therefore \nrecommended continued support to the IARCs. Other lessons had however, emerged from \ndeveloping and implementing the previous seven RETAs: the need for greater rigor in project \npreparation by the IARCs; greater involvement of regional departments (RDs) with the ANRR \nRETA to forge linkages with ADB country strategies and operations; and improved mutual \nunderstanding and coordination among the IARCs, country sector planners, and aid agencies to \nmaximize relevance, sense of ownership, and value addition. To address these concerns, the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department initiated discussions with the RDs and the \nAgriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (ANRRD) Committee in November 2002. \nAs a result of the deliberations, the Agriculture, Natural Resources and Social Sectors Division, \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department (RSAN) prepared comprehensive guidelines \nfor submission of proposals for the annual RETA on ANRR, specifying ADB\u2019s expectations of \nrigor in project preparation, participation and ownership of the countries concerned, and the \nproposals' alignment with the country priorities. The guidelines gave details of selection and \nevaluation modalities, including the criteria to be applied in proposal evaluation, and thereby not \nonly made the whole process transparent, but also systematically linked the RDs with project \nselection, processing, and administration of the research grants. The guidelines, prepared and \ncirculated  in  April  2003,  were  welcomed  by  the  international  research  community,  which \nresponded by submitting 24 good quality proposals for the eighth 2004 RETA. \n \n3.  The selection process for the proposed RETA has been rigorous. Before starting the \nevaluation process, the regional directors of agriculture divisions and members of the ANRRD \nCommittee3 met to review the evaluation and selection criteria specified in the guidelines to reach \na consensus on the broad principles to apply in selection. The ANNRD Committee met on 15 July \n2003 to technically evaluate the proposals in accordance with the criteria and agreements \nreached in the preceding meeting. The Committee also considered the total funds available for \nthe 2004 RETA and decided to prioritize proposals that were complete in all respects, and \ndemonstrated innovation, value addition, and relevance to emerging priorities in agriculture in \nAsia. Other criteria applied in short-listing proposals were attractiveness of the project design, \ncontinuation into the next phase of projects that have shown positive and useful outcomes, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995.

", "2    \nrelevance  and  synergy  with  ADB  operations,  linkages  and  impact  on  poverty,  previous \nperformance and track record of the research center, and participating countries' involvement in \nproposal development, demonstration of a sense of ownership and commitment. A shortlist of six \nproposals  was  finalized  and  forwarded  to  the  Project  Approval  Committee  (PAC)  for  its \nconsideration. \n \n4.  The PAC, which is composed of directors from the agriculture, environment and natural \nresources  divisions  of  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  and  chaired  by  the  director  of  RSAN, \nendorsed the  ranking of the ANRRD Committee and discussed the merits of each prioritized \nproposal. Keeping the budget for the 2004 RETA in view, the PAC selected four proposals: three \nsubmitted  by  IARCs\u2014International  Rice  Research  Institute  (IRRI),  International  Center  for \nAgricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), and WorldFish Center (formerly International \nCenter for Living Aquatic Resources Management)\u2014and one by ADB's Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD).  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Sustainable development encompasses the combination of economic development, social \ndevelopment, and conservation of the environment and natural resources. In the Asian context \nwhere poverty is rampant and the vast majority of the poor live in rural areas, agriculture provides \nthe  single  most  important  source  of  food  security,  income,  and  livelihoods.  It  is  therefore \nimperative  to  improve  agriculture  productivity,  diversify  cropping  options,  and  add  value  to \nagricultural produce. The growth strategies of most of our developing member countries (DMCs) \nrecognize  the  importance  of  agriculture  and  give  it  priority,  but  equally  emphasize  the \nconservation and sustainability of natural resources.  \n \n6.  Starting with the Green Revolution, agriculture has grown over the last several decades. \nBut the challenge of an increasing population and rising food requirements in the next 30 years in \nAsia remains formidable, especially because the region's food production needs cannot be met \nthrough increased cropping intensity alone. The best areas and the most fertile soils have already \nbeen  cultivated,  most  economic  crops  have  been  harvested,  complex  second-generation \nproblems of new pests and diseases have emerged, nutrient absorption is poor, and water is \ninadequate.  The  biggest  challenge comes from the need to produce food and fodder from \nunfavorable  agroclimatic  environments  with  lands  that  are  not  so  well-endowed, and have \ndegraded soils and water resources of poor quality. Years of misuse have left millions of hectares \nof arable lands degraded in Asia, making them prone to drought, desertification, soil erosion, loss \nof fertility, and depleting forest cover. In many of these areas, existing agricultural technologies \ncannot  support  further  increases  in  production  or  even  sustain  existing  levels;  and  new \ntechnological options are needed. In many regions of Asia, farmers and national research and \nextension systems lack information, expertise and confidence to address these constraints. There \nis therefore a major need\u2014and opportunity\u2014to support and catalyze innovations in technology, \ndisseminate  successes,  enhance  the  capacities  of  farmers  and  the  national  research  and \nextension systems, and support appropriate public policies to boost growth in agriculture.  \n \n7.  The CGIAR, established in 1971, is an association of 16 IARCs working in over 100 \ndeveloping  countries  to  mobilize  cutting-edge  science  to  achieve  sustainable  food  security, \nprotect the environment, and reduce poverty. The CGIAR research agenda is focused on both \nstrategic and applied research and includes the entire range of problems affecting agricultural \nproductivity, sustainable management of natural resources, protection of biodiversity, etc. In the \nlast three decades, IARCs have used their core budgets and external support to deliver higher \nyielding food crops; more productive livestock, fish, and trees; environmentally benign farming ", "      3\nsystems;  better  policies;  enhanced  scientific  capacities  in  developing  countries;  and  many \ndividends to poor farmers through better resource use, increased output, and greater incomes. \n \n8.  The  proposed  RETA  will  be  the  eighth  umbrella  RETA  for  agricultural  and  natural \nresources research at IARCs. It will support proposals that are focused on the poorest regions \nand  farmers  of  Asia  and  address  problems  of  rain-fed  rice-producing  areas  of  South  and \nSoutheast Asia; soil and water management in the semiarid areas of Central Asia; and poor \nbreeding material for the fish farmers of Southeast and South Asia. The RETA is consistent with \nADB\u2019s policy on ANRR and fully meets its three strategic objectives of sustainable management \nof natural resources, increase in agriculture productivity, and poverty reduction. The proposed \nRETA  also  reinforces  the  priorities  and  approaches  outlined  in  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic \nframework4 and the poverty reduction strategy.5 A summary of all ADB assistance to the IARCs \nincluding the CGIAR is in Appendix 1.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The proposed RETA aims to improve livelihoods, increase incomes, and reduce the \npoverty  of  farmers  who  depend  on  agriculture  and  fisheries  but  operate  in  unfavorable \nenvironments: semiarid and marginal lands, rain-fed areas without irrigation, and areas where \nwater resources are inadequate and high-yielding varieties of fish are unavailable. The RETA will \nhelp farming communities improve their livelihoods by developing and disseminating technologies \nto  improve  and  stabilize  rice  productivity;  by  demonstrating  efficient  water  and  soil  fertility \nmanagement on small farms, particularly in the semiarid areas; by disseminating improved \nspecies of carp to poor fish farmers; and by building the capacities of national systems to develop \nand disseminate technology. The proposed RETA will thereby contribute to the efforts of 13 \nmember countries of ADB who are participating in the project to increase agricultural productivity \nand farmers' incomes, improve food security and nutrition, conserve natural resources, develop \nhuman resources in both the public and private sectors, and strengthen the capacity for public \npolicy research.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.     The proposed RETA includes four stand-alone projects that support the development, \napplication, and dissemination of scientific research on problems faced by farmers in the region. \nAll projects share common goals, but will be implemented independently by the three IARCs \n(ICARDA,  IRRI,  and  WorldFish  Center)  and  ADB.  The  projects  follow:  Improving  Rural \nLivelihoods Through Efficient On-Farm Water and Soil Fertility Management in Central Asia \n(ICARDA), Integrating and Mobilizing Rice Knowledge to Improve and Stabilize Crop Productivity \nto Achieve Household Food Security in Diverse and Less Favorable Rain-Fed Areas (IRRI), \nAchieving Greater Food Security and Eliminating Poverty by Dissemination of Improved Carp \nSpecies to Fish Farmers (WorldFish Center), and  Regional Workshops on Agricultural and \nNatural Resources Research in the Central and South Asian Regions (ADB). All four projects \naddress the strategic agenda of the ANRR policy, have been identified in close consultation with \nparticipating DMCs, and will be implemented in close collaboration with them. Synopses of the \nprojects are in paras. 11-14, and detailed project descriptions, including their project frameworks, \nare in Appendixes 2-5.  \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

Improving Rural Livelihoods Through Efficient On-farm Water and Soil Fertility \nManagement in Central Asia. The project aims to generate greater economic returns for rural \nhouseholds in six countries of Central Asia: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The project will refine and disseminate technological innovations \nand  promote  adoption  by  farmers  particularly  for  efficient  on-farm water management; for \nconservation tillage and soil management practices under both rain-fed and irrigated conditions; \nand for crop diversification to minimize risks of smallholder enterprises. The project will identify \nkey policy options to support adoption of new technologies; strengthen national research and \ntechnology  transfer  systems  and  capacities;  and  link  project  outputs  to  other  aid-financed \nagriculture development projects in the region to enhance impact and sustainability.  \n \n12.  Integrating  and  Mobilizing  Rice  Knowledge  to  Improve  and  Stabilize  Crop \nProductivity to Achieve Household Food Security in Diverse and Less Favorable Rain-Fed \nAreas. The project aims to stabilize and increase rice production to achieve household food \nsecurity in a range of unfavorable monsoon-dependent rice environments in Asia and enhance \nthe core competencies for rice research in these environments. Cropping systems (deepwater \nrice\u2013dry-season rice or deepwater rice\u2013other dry-season crops) will be designed; technologies to \nincrease productivity and reduce risks in rice-based cropping systems developed and evaluated \nwith farmers; and experiences shared across key sites of the target environments. The project will \nlink with the existing rice network\u2014Consortium for Unfavorable Rice Environments (CURE)\u2014and \npromote regional cooperation; build on work undertaken earlier and mobilize scientific knowledge \nto improve rice productivity; and reduce risks for resource-poor farm households in Bangladesh, \nIndia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n \n13.  Achieving  Greater  Food  Security  and  Eliminating  Poverty  by  Dissemination  of \nImproved Carp Species to Fish Farmers. Carps are the single most important group of fish \ncontributing to world aquaculture production and 98% of them come from Asia. The first ANRR \nRETA in 1996 gave a grant of $1.3 million to WorldFish Center to undertake genetic improvement \nof carp species.6 The proposed project aims to test, demonstrate, and disseminate improved \nspecies to fish farmers, hatchery managers, and national researchers and extensionists. The \nproject will consolidate strain improvement work, test and evaluate improved species in farmers\u2019 \nfields, and establish national carp breeding programs. It will increase fish production and improve \nnutrition  and  incomes  of  small-scale  fish  farmers  and  poor  fish  consumers  in  Bangladesh, \nPeople's Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n \n14.  Regional  Workshops  on  Agricultural  and  Natural  Resources  Research  in  the \nCentral and South Asian Regions. This project responds to the key lesson learned and needs \nidentified  so  as  to  enhance  mutual  understanding  of  work  and  priorities,  and  reinforce \npartnerships and commitment among IARCs, country sector planners, managers, researchers, \nand  aid  agencies  in  the  sector,  particularly  ADB.  The  proposed  project  will  facilitate  two \ninteractive  regional  forums  on  ANRR,  to  begin  with,  in  Central  and  South  Asia.  The  two \nworkshops will aim to enhance linkages between the IARCs and the national aid agency and \nprograms, so that resources can be optimally used, research can become more demand driven, \nand results will be more accessible. ADB will take the lead in planning and organizing the \nworkshops in consultation with concerned regional departments. \n \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 1996.

The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $8.4 million equivalent (Appendix 6). ADB will \nfinance $3.0 million (36%of the total cost) on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nsponsoring IARCs will finance $3.4 million equivalent (40%) from their core budgets, and the \nparticipating national agriculture research systems (NARSs) will contribute $2.0 million equivalent \n(24%). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB  will  enter  into  separate  TA  agreements  with  each  IARC.  Each  IARC  will  be \ndesignated the Executing Agency (EA) and will be responsible for implementing and successfully \ncompleting its own project. The 19 participating NARSs will be designated as the Implementing \nAgencies  (IAs)  and  will  work  in  close  collaboration  with  the  concerned  IARCs.  Letters  of \ncommitment to this effect have been received from all participating NARSs. The EAs will appoint \na project coordinator and team leader, who will coordinate, plan, and supervise all activities under \nthe project; monitor project progress; and submit required reports to ADB and other collaborating \npartners. Similarly, each IA will appoint a national team leader who will be responsible for \ncoordination, implementation, and reporting on the project for the country. RSAN will implement \nthe coordination workshops for Central and South Asia assisted by two domestic consultants. \n \n17.  Each project is expected to begin in January 2004 and be implemented over 3 years, i.e., \nup to January 2007. Inception Workshops will be organized within the first 3 months after the \nproject starts to firm up project plans and implementation arrangements with partners. The EA will \nalso organize annual planning and review meetings and a project completion workshop, which \nwill be attended by all project partners including ADB. Each IARC will be required to submit the \nfollowing reports to ADB: (i) semiannual progress reports, (ii) semiannual financial statements \naccounting for the use of project funds, (iii) audited annual financial statements, and (iv) a \ncomprehensive completion report within 3 months of project closure. Funds will be drawn down in \nsemiannual installments based on each IARC\u2019s estimate of forthcoming expenditures and subject \nto satisfactory liquidation of expenditures for previously disbursed funds. Project officers with \nsuitable technical expertise will be assigned to administer the projects at ADB and will be required \nto undertake at least one supervisory mission to each of the projects per year. The office of the \ndirector of RSAN, in close consultation with the offices of the five regional directors for agriculture, \nenvironment,  and  natural  resources,7  will  be  responsible  for  overall  administration  of  the \nproposed umbrella RETA, maintenance of accounts, and preparation of status reports. \n \n18.  All participating IARCs will procure goods and services according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  At  the  end  of  the  TA,  equipment  purchased  will  be  assigned  to  the  EA/IAs \nconcerned. The IARCs and ADB will engage specialists in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB, using the biodata format. \nBefore engaging the specialists, IARCs will submit their curricula vitae to ADB for approval.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 on a grant basis for the Eighth Agriculture and \nNatural Resources Research at International Agricultural Research Centers. \n                                                 \n7  South Asia Department, Mekong Department, Southeast Asia Department, East and Central Asia Department, and \nPacific Department.

Introduction \n1.  Following their independence from the former Soviet Union, the Central Asian republics \n(CARs) of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan have faced \nfood scarcity, falling incomes, and increasing poverty levels. The collapse of the Soviet supply \nnetwork and withdrawal of subsidies have led to a significant contracting of the agriculture \nsector, and an almost 50% fall in agricultural output. Some signs of recovery have been noted of \nlate, but the indices for agriculture and food production remain well below pre-independence \nlevels. Agriculture continues to be important for the economies of these countries because, \neven at a conservative estimate, it accounts for 22% of the region\u2019s gross domestic product and \nemploys some 40% of its labor force.  \n \n2.  The region therefore  faces the enormous challenge of improving its agriculture and \nincreasing  agricultural  productivity,  with  many  constraints  including  variable  and  uncertain \nrainfall, cold winters and hot dry summers, etc.; inadequate or poorquality water resources; \nsmall fragmented landholdings because of decollectivization and privatization; lack of small- \nscale farming technologies; and poor management of natural resources, both soil and water. \nICARDA has, however, demonstrated in the last few years that appropriate water management \nand field irrigation practices using different sources of water, together with appropriate soil \nconservation practices and better management of inputs, can remedy the situation and increase \nagricultural productivity. \n \n3.  In  2000,  ICARDA  initiated  a  3-year  applied  research  project  on  soil  and  water \nmanagement in partnership with the national programs of the CARs.1  The project developed \nand tested many new technologies and had many positive outcomes, but considerable work \nremains to be done both with building capacity in weak research systems, and developing and \ndisseminating technology to the farming community. The CARs have requested ICARDA to \ncontinue developing, adapting, and disseminating the needed technologies for the region. A \nproposal for a second phase has therefore been prepared, discussed with the agriculture \nministries and farming communities of all five countries, and endorsed by them. The proposal is \nthe outcome of extensive consultations with the five countries plus Azerbaijan, and the many \nsuggestions made by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) during meetings and site visits to the \nfirst phase of the project. A joint letter of support was signed by the heads of all six national \nagricultural research systems (NARSs) and submitted to ADB.  \n    \nB.  Issues \n4.  Considerable progress was made during the first phase of the project and many farm-\nlevel research sites were established in different agro-ecological zones of the five countries. The \nsites are testing soil and water management options for different cropping systems, improving \nproductivity  of  different  sources  of  water  (rainfall,  runoff,  and  alternative  irrigation  water \nsources), and safe practices in using marginal water (low-quality water, such as drain water, \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1999.  Regional Technical Assistance for Fourth Agriculture and Natural Resources Research at CGIAR \nCenters\u2014On-Farm Soil and Water Management for Sustainable Agricultural Systems in Central Asia. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 2  17 \ntreated wastewater, brackish water, etc.). Many technologies are ready for dissemination and \nadoption by farmers\u2014zero and conservation tillage techniques for rain-fed, irrigated, and spring \nwheat; soil leaching for salt-affected lands; strip cropping on sloping areas; furrow and contour \nirrigation, portable chutes in sloping areas; low-pressure drip irrigation for grapevines; and \ninterrow spacing for vegetables. Some technologies, like those associated with marginal water \nuse, need further adaptive research before they can be disseminated to farmers. \n \n5.  In  addition,  many  other  issues  relating  to  different  physical  environments  (plains, \nmountains, foothills, and upland valleys) and biophysical resources (soil, availability of water, \netc.) still need to be addressed. Some relate to problems of transition, including lack of an \nappropriate policy framework, institutional capacities, markets, and information, etc. In some \ncountries,  existing  policies  hamper  the  adoption  of  new  technologies,  especially  crop \ndiversification  and  conservation  tillage.  Therefore,  a  holistic  and  integrated  approach  is \nnecessary to develop and sustain an efficient agriculture sector in the region.  \n \n6.  Land and water use however, continue to pose the biggest challenge. In lowlands (major \nparts of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan), overexploitation of land resources coupled \nwith monocropping and lack of fertilizers has led to low organic matter content, poor soil health, \nand reduced soil fertility. Therefore, appropriate low-cost crop management practices and crop \nrotations are needed for all farmers. In sloping areas and mountains (most of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Tajikistan, and parts of Uzbekistan), the major problem of soil erosion requires land-\nuse technologies that are productive but resource-conserving. Wider adoption of conservation \ntillage is expected to help combat soil erosion, and reduce production and energy costs.   \n \n7.  Water  availability  is  also  critical  for  most  of  Central  Asia\u2014except  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2014which is located upstream of the major river systems\u2014and Azerbaijan because of \ngenerally  dry  climate  and  frequent  drought.  Water  use  efficiency  is  still  low  due  to  poor \nmaintenance of irrigation systems and use of inappropriate irrigation technologies that cause \nsoil salinity and waterlogging. There is also an urgent need for watersaving technologies as well \nas options for sustainable use of available marginal water resources. \n \n8.  Based on consultations with NARS, farmers, and ADB\u2019s review missions, a number of \nissues were prioritized for the proposed project. These are (i) verifying preliminary results from \nthe ongoing on-farm trials and identifying opportunities for scaling them up in similar farming \nsystems; (ii) characterizing the agro-ecology of the region, using geographic information system \n(GIS) and other tools; (iii) synthesizing results, and specifying \u201crecommendation domains\u201d for \nparticular technologies according to agro-ecological characteristics; (iv) developing technical \nguidelines in applying recommended technologies; and (v) disseminating accepted technologies \nto a broader audience.  \n \n9.  The other high priority identified was the need for coordination and linkage mechanisms \nwithin and between research systems in different countries of the region and between the \nnational systems and the international scientific community. These systems existed under the \nformer Soviet Union, but broke down with the emergence of, what are now, independent \ncountries. As a result, researchers are not able to keep abreast of scientific advances or to \naccess technologies. The proposed project aims to fill this gap and promote regional and \ninterregional cooperation. \n \n10.  Lack of linkage has also resulted in the NARS' poor capacity to undertake research, \ndisseminate technologies, operate and maintain important equipment, and advance the work \nthat has been initiated. The NARS are also ill equipped to respond to production needs and ", "18  Appendix 2 \npriorities of private farmers, and the emerging market economies. For these reasons, training \nscientists is a priority, not only in technical aspects of research but in research methodologies, \nfarmer participatory approaches, economic and financial impact analysis, etc.  \n \n11.  There are no formal channels through which scientists can disseminate information, \nknowledge, and new technologies to farmers. The project will help the national programs \nstrengthen their technology transfer programs and disseminate project results to policy makers, \nextension services, and the broader farming community. To this end, the project will also work \nto assess potential constraints to widespread adoption of recommended technologies and \nidentify potential policy and institutional options that can facilitate the adoption of improved \ntechnologies and resource management practices.   \n \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The overall goal is to contribute to poverty reduction, food security, and conservation of \nnatural  resources  in  Central  Asia  by  promoting  diversified  and  sustainable  agricultural \nproduction systems (Table A2.1). \n \n13.  The  immediate  objective  is  farmers'  adoption  of  technological  and  institutional \ninnovations that conserve soil and water, are input-use efficient, generate greater economic \nreturns to rural households, and are sustainable. \n \n14.  Purpose. The work initiated under the first phase of the project will be taken further, and \ntechnologies will be tested and disseminated in partnership with farmers, local communities, \nand staff of the NARSs.  \n \n15.  Considering the similarities in agro-ecological characteristics in many parts of the region, \nand similar institutional weaknesses in the agriculture research and extension systems, there \nare enormous advantages and opportunities for regional and subregional cooperation in the \nsector. The project will identify new learning and cooperation opportunities within and around \nthe region for seeking knowledge, information, technologies, equipment, markets, and skills.  \n \n16.  Agriculture being a high priority in Central Asian countries, many aid-assisted projects \nare focused on increasing agricultural productivity in the region through farm restructuring, \nrehabilitation of irrigation infrastructures, liberalization of prices, and marketing. The proposed \nproject will seek opportunities to link its adaptive research outputs with other ongoing and \nplanned agricultural projects to complement their goals and add value to their activities. Such \ncollaboration  has  already  been  initiated  with  the  ADB-funded  projects  in  Tajikistan  (Rural \nPoverty Reduction Project and Agricultural Rehabilitation Project) and Uzbekistan (Amu Zhang \nWater Resources Management Project) in phase 1 and will be expanded during phase 2. \n \n17.  Outputs. Phase 2 of the project specifically aims to \n(i)  generate and disseminate appropriate technologies for efficient on-farm water \nmanagement; \n(ii)  promote and refine suitable conservation tillage and soil management practices \nunder both rain-fed and irrigated conditions; \n(iii)  identify and promote alternative crops to diversify farm enterprises and increase \nproductivity and income; \n(iv)  strengthen national research and technology transfer capacities and programs; ", "  Appendix 2  19 \n(v)  promote the development of regional and interregional collaborative network; \n(vi)  promote rapid impact by linking with ongoing developmentrelated projects in the \nregion to disseminate the new technologies; and \n(vii)  identify  key  policy  and  institutional  options  to  support  the  adoption  of  new \ntechnologies. \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n18.  The project follows a holistic approach and will be implemented with four integrated \ncomponents: \n \na.  Efficient and Sustainable Use of Available Water \n19.  Best water-saving technologies identified during phase 1 of the project (alternate furrow \nirrigation, micro-irrigation, contour irrigation, etc.) will be tested and verified, and economic \nassessments  carried  out  under  varying  agro-ecological  conditions  and  different  cropping \npatterns. To help the poorest farmers, major emphasis will be  on technologies that can be \napplied on sloping and marginal lands (saline and eroded soils). Budgeting techniques and cost-\nbenefit analyses will be carried out to evaluate the outcomes of research and to predict potential \nadoption rates. Recommendations will be developed on the basis of the findings and feedback \nfrom farmers. \n \n20.  Available types of marginal water for irrigating different crops will be tested on farms. \nResults  will  be  evaluated  for  environmental  sustainability  and  potential  to  increase  crop \nproductivity, using methodologies developed and tested in phase 1. Economic assessment and \ncost-benefit  evaluation  will  be  carried  out  to  identify  best  cropping  scenarios  with  use  of \nmarginal water. Efficient and sustainable biodrainage systems will be developed and tested for \nreclamation of saline soil and sustainable use of drainage water. \n \nb.  Conservation Tillage, Soil Fertility Management, and Crop \nDiversification \n21.  Conservation tillage and no-tillage direct sowing technologies that have been developed \nwill be disseminated on a larger scale. Applied research will focus on developing and testing \ntools and equipment as well as assessing their effect on soil conservation and fertility, crop \nproductivity,  and  economic  returns.  Cost-benefit  evaluation  will  be  conducted  for  different \nmarket scenarios. \n \n22.  Successful  crop  diversification  technology  will  be  disseminated  to  larger  areas  for \nadoption. New alternative crops that can maintain soil fertility and can be used in more profitable \nand sustainable farming systems will be identified. Research using GIS and other modeling \ntools will be conducted to define the spatial domains in terms of both biophysical and socio-\neconomic conditions where such crops could be successfully introduced. Crop rotation studies \nwill focus on introducing legumes and other alternative crops such as oilseeds and fodder crops \nin the vast fallow lands in the region as well as to break the monocropping of cereals and cotton \nin rain-fed and irrigated production systems. \n \n23.  The effect of these technologies on soil fertility, and efficiency of water and inputs \n(fertilizer,  pesticide,  fuel)  with  respect  to  crop  sequences  and  conservation  tillage  will  be \nassessed. Implications for rural women will also be assessed. \n ", "20  Appendix 2 \nc.  Strengthening the Capacity of Farmers, and of National Scientists \nfor Research and Technology Transfer \n24.  Farmers\u2019 capacities will be strengthened by fully involving them in project activities. Also, \nfield days and traveling workshops will be organized, both within and between countries, so that \nlessons from successful examples of improved soil and water management can be widely \nshared by farmers operating under similar environmental and socioeconomic conditions. Two \ndemonstration sites will be established in each country as focal points for learning, information \nexchange, and technology assessments. Manuals, bulletins, and guidelines will be produced \nand made available for farmers' use.  \n \n25.  Scientific staff will be trained  in  long- and short-term regional training courses and \nthrough participation in international workshops and conferences. English language courses will \nbe organized for young scientists to strengthen their skills in research, and in analyzing the \neconomic and financial impacts of research results. NARS scientists will also be trained in \ntechnology transfer and information dissemination.  \n \nd.  Impact Assessment, Constraints Analysis and Policy Research \n26.  Socioeconomic surveys and case studies will be undertaken to assess adoption, impact, \nand constraints to adoption on all farm structures from large collective farms to small private \nlandholdings. The sustainable livelihoods framework will be used to investigate livelihoods, \nresources, and strategies to understand the constraints and benefits of technology adoption. \nMarketing studies will identify constraints to crop diversification and potential policy options so \nas to aid in marketing the identified new crop options.  An inventory of current policies and \ninstitutional arrangements will be compiled and the potential effects of policy changes on \nproduction choices, farm income, input use, and water and soil resources will be analyzed. \nResults will be presented to local and national policy makers and aid agencies through policy \nworkshops, policy analysis digests, and fact sheets. Expected outputs, performance targets, \nand activity schedules   have  been  developed  and submitted  to   ADB.  \n \n27.  Outputs  and  performance  targets  as  well  as  activity  schedules  are  provided  as \nsupplementary appendixes. \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n28.  The total cost of the project is estimated at $2.085 million equivalent (Table A2.2). It is \nproposed that ADB provide $1.0 million on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program to \nfinance 48% of the total cost. The remaining cost will be financed by the in-kind contribution of \nICARDA  ($763,000 equivalent) and the NARS ($322,000 equivalent). The project will seek \npossibilities for deploying additional resources for large-scale farm testing and dissemination \nactivities through linkages with other technical assistance and/or development projects in the \nregion funded by ADB and other organizations. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n29.  The project will build on existing partnerships with NARS and other stakeholders and will \ncontinue to be implemented within the CGIAR Systemwide Collaborative Research Program for \nSustainable Agricultural Development in Central Asia and the Caucasus. The project steering \ncommittee, consisting of representatives from ICARDA, all participating national programs, and \naid agencies, will continue as established under phase 1. The project will be executed by ", "  Appendix 2  21 \nICARDA through its Tashkent office. The Executing Agency (EA) will designate a project \nmanager to be responsible for all project activities. A technical coordinator along with two local \nstaff members will be recruited by ICARDA as consultants under the TA and positioned in the \nTashkent office to oversee and coordinate research and technology transfer activities under the \ndirect supervision of the project manager. Their qualifications and terms of reference have been \nsubmitted to ADB. \n \n30.  As in phase 1, research teams will be established in each country and one national \nscientist will be appointed as a national team leader. He will (i) develop and implement the \napproved national work plan; (ii) coordinate the research and training activities in the country; \n(iii) recommend the annual budget, including capital items; and (iv) coordinate and prepare the \nannual and technical reports.  \n \n31.  Research planning and review meetings will be held annually, at which annual reports \nand results will be presented and plans for the coming season discussed. A project start up \nworkshop will be organized within the first 3 months of the project to explain project operation, \ndevelop and agree on work plans, and firm up project monitoring and reporting systems. At the \nend of the project, a completion workshop will be organized to take stock of the progress made \nand coordinate necessary actions to ensure the sustainability of the project results.  \n \n32.  Every 6 months, ICARDA as the EA will submit to ADB a progress and financial report \nbased on the reports provided by the NARS teams from the participating countries. In addition, \nICARDA will submit semiannual financial statements and annual audited statements detailing \nthe use of the project funds. Within 3 months of project completion, ICARDA will prepare and \nsubmit to ADB a final report describing the results of the project, the use of ADB funds, and \nstrategies for sustaining the work in the future. \n \n33.  The goods, services, and other items of expenditure required to carry out the project will \nbe procured in accordance with arrangements and procedures satisfactory to ADB, including the \nGuidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, as may be amended \nfrom time to time, or through other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. \n \n34.  The project  will be implemented in areas where the activities of phase 1 had been \ninitiated. Any changes to be made in the project area will be finalized during the inception \nworkshop in consultation with NARS. Project funds will be largely utilized for disseminating of \ntechnologies  to  farmers.  The  project  will  also  seek  possibilities  for  deploying  additional \nresources  for  large-scale  farm  testing  and  dissemination  activities  through  linkages  with \ndevelopment programs in the region funded by ADB and other organizations. \n \n35.  Quantifiable and monitorable indicators for measuring project performance are listed in \nthe  technical  assistance  framework  (Table  A2.1).  During  the  project,  performance  will  be \nmeasured by the number of participating farmers, results from field trials, and eventually by the \nnumber of farmers adopting the technologies and the area on which technologies are used. \nBeyond  the  end  of  the  project,  poverty  outcomes  will  be  measured  by  changes  in  farm \nhousehold incomes in the target areas; economic outcomes will be measured by changes in \nagricultural outputs, inputs, and costs of production; environmental outcomes will be measured \nby changes in the amount of water used in irrigation, quality of irrigation and drainage water, \ndegree of soil degradation, and soil quality, soil fertility and organic matter content. Baseline \ndata will be collected in target areas to allow the changes to be quantified. Project staff (IARC \nand national staff) will be responsible for monitoring performance during the project.  Beyond ", "22  Appendix 2 \nthe end of the project, national staff will be responsible for long-term monitoring of poverty, \neconomic and environmental outcomes, with backstopping from IARC staff, where required, and \nsubject to available resources. \n \nD.  Potential Project Impact \n36.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  objectives  of  achieving  sustainable  and \nremunerative farming systems for poor farmers and the sustainable management of agricultural \nand natural resources. The emphasis on disseminating promising technologies through linkages \nwith other ADB development projects is also consistent with ADB priorities, as are the focus on \ncapacity  building,  socioeconomic,  and  policy  research,  and  the  use  of  participatory  and \ncommunity-based approaches. The project will therefore contribute to all six of ADB\u2019s priorities \nfor agricultural and natural resources research (ANRR) as outlined in the technical assistance \nframework. \n \n37.  About 75% of the rural population in the region of Central Asia and Azerbaijan are \nsmallholders. Improved management of soil and water resources will directly benefit these farm \nhouseholds by increasing on-farm production, diversifying production options and increasing \nfarm incomes. In turn these results are expected to generate economic growth and reduce \npoverty  in  rural  communities  by  creating  greater  opportunities  for  employment.  Orienting \nproduction options to market opportunities and introducing alternative crops will help small \nfarmers move from subsistence production to income-generating activities in both rural and peri-\nurban areas. Diversified agriculture will enhance household diets and nutrition, and increased \nproduction will lead to increased food supplies for both rural and urban consumers and greater \nfood security. The project will also have a direct impact on the effectiveness of NARSs by \nbuilding their capacity to undertake a demand-driven, problem-oriented, multidisciplinary and \nparticipatory approach to agricultural research. \n \n38.  Improved water management practices are expected to be adopted by about 20% of the \nfarmers in the target areas. The adoption of conservation tillage will vary from country to \ncountry. In Kazakhstan where conservation tillage is well known and specific machinery is \nmanufactured, adoption of improved practices may cover an area of up to 0.5 million hectares \n(ha).  In  other  countries,  the  technology  could  potentially  be  adopted  on  50,000  ha. \nRecommended  alternative  crops  for  diversification  may  potentially  occupy  areas  of  up  to \n300,000 ha in Kazakhstan, 100,000 ha in Uzbekistan, and up to 50,000 ha in Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and Turkmenistan.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  23 \nTable A2.1: Technical Assistance Framework \nInternational Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and \nIndicators/Targetsa  Risks \nGoal         \nPoverty reduction, food security,  Number of rural households  Government statistics   \nand conservation of natural  below the poverty line in the   \nresources in Central Asia through  project area reduced by 15%\u00b7  Environmental \nthe promotion of diversified and    Assessments \nsustainable agricultural  Agricultural production in the \nproduction systems  project area increased by 15% \n \nIrrigation water use in the project \narea reduced by 20%  \n \nSoil erosion in the project area \nreduced by 15% \n \nArea affected by soil salinity \nwithin the project area reduced by \n10% \n \nPurpose       \nAdoption by farmers of  Technologies adopted by 10% of  Farm surveys  Enabling government \ntechnological and institutional  farmers in project areas     policies and legislation \ninnovations that are resource    Technical reports  exist. \nconserving, sustainable, and  20% increase in cropping intensity     \nefficient and generate greater  throughout pilot demonstration  Progress reports from  Resources for NARS to \neconomic returns to rural  area  participating countries  sustain activities \nhouseholds    beyond the end of the \n15% increase in yield (kg/ha)  project are sufficient. \nthroughout the pilot demonstration \narea  \n \n15% increase in water productivity \n(kg/unit of water applied) \nthroughout the pilot demonstration \narea  \n \nOutputs       \n1.

Introduction \n1.  To meet food security needs of poor farmers, the International Rice Research Institute \n(IRRI) has been working for more than a decade to increase and stabilize rice production in \nunfavorable rain-fed areas in Asia with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In \n1991 IRRI initiated and coordinated the Rainfed Lowland Rice Research Consortium (RLRRC), \na network of national agricultural research and extension systems (NARES) to conduct strategic \nrice  research  at  diverse  rain-fed  rice  environments  in  five  countries:  Bangladesh,  India, \nIndonesia,  Philippines,  and  Thailand.  In  1993  IRRI  began  work  on  rain-fed  uplands  and \nestablished, again with ADB support, the Upland Rice Research Consortium (URRC), covering \nsix countries:  India, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Philippines, \nThailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  An  external  review  of  the  two  consortia  in  2001  noted  the \nachievements in identifying and understanding the constraints to production in the diverse rain-\nfed environments, developing new rice technologies that are more suited to those environments, \nand the payoffs in building the capacity of NARES scientists in the process. The review panel \nrecommended merging the consortia and focusing on enhancing impact by wider dissemination \nof feasible solutions that had been evaluated with farmers at key research sites.  \n \n2.  In mid-2002, the seven partner countries of the RLRRC and URRC approved the \nmerging  and  formation  of  the  Consortium  for  Unfavorable  Rice  Environments  (CURE), \ncoordinated  by  IRRI.  Building  on  the  knowledge  gained,  technologies  developed,  and \npartnerships  established  over  the  past  decade,  the  CURE  now  emphasizes  bringing \ntechnologies and knowledge to farmers, and working with them to adapt the accumulated \nknowledge  to  their  specific  needs,  conditions,  and  livelihood  strategies.  This  implies  a \ncorresponding shift from the linear approach of passing on research outputs from scientists to \nextension, and then to farmers, to a more participatory mode of working together with all \npartners. Wide consultations among partners and stakeholders have identified three major rain-\nfed lowland environments for CURE to focus on: drought-, submergence-, and salt-affected \nlowlands  that  occur  extensively  across  monsoon  Asia;  and  three  distinct  highlands \nenvironments\u2014the drought-affected plateaus in South Asia, the drought-prone and very fragile \nmountain areas of continental Southeast Asia, and the rainy but intensively cultivated uplands of \nIndonesia and Philippines.  \n \nB.  Issues \n3.  Vast  areas  in  monsoon  Asia  are  not  reached  by  major  irrigation  infrastructure \ndevelopment. Nonetheless, they support large populations, estimated at 1 billion people, who \nare disproportionately poor (e.g., the poverty rates of the largely rain-fed states of Bihar and \nOrissa in eastern India are 43% and 47%, respectively, compared with the national average of \n26%). These areas face drought (about 25 million hectares [ha]), prolonged and flash floods \n(more than 16 million ha), and adverse soil and water quality such as alkaline and saline \nconditions (more than 12 million ha). Farming in these areas is affected by the vagaries of \nweather and allows limited time windows for cropping. As a result, crop yields are low and are \noften damaged or fail completely. Farmers either cannot afford or are reluctant to invest in \ninputs  because  of  risks.  A  failed  crop  year  has  prolonged  destabilizing  effects  on  poor \nhouseholds  that  cannot  afford  to  purchase  grain  to  supplement  their  staple-food  deficit. ", "30  Appendix 3 \nNonsustainable  use  of  land,  particularly  on  steep  slopes,  and  inability  to  apply  inputs  or \nconserve the soil further degrade the land resources. \n \n4.  Past and ongoing studies have improved understanding of the characteristics of the \nvarious rain-fed environments, the nature and severity of stresses on the rice crop, and the main \nstrategies for overcoming production constraints. However, achieving widespread impact has \nbeen  more  difficult  in  rain-fed  rice-based  systems  than  in  irrigated  systems  because \ntechnologies (varieties as well as crop management practices) have to be tailored to diverse \nbiophysical and socioeconomic conditions to ensure sustainability and the impact of improved \ntechnologies that can enhance the livelihoods of poor farm households. \n \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Purpose and Output \n5.  The project goal is to improve food security and livelihoods of predominantly rice-\ngrowing farmers living in unfavorable rain-fed areas in monsoon Asia. To achieve the goal, this \nproposed project aims to \n \n(i)  identify opportunities for improving rice productivity in the production systems \nand livelihood strategies of mainly subsistence households; \n(ii)  introduce promising rice technologies to farmers and help them test, adapt, and \nadopt these technologies to suit local situations;  \n(iii)  distill, from site-specific studies, operational principles and practices that can be \nshared with other areas experiencing similar problems;  \n(iv)  enhance the capacity of NARES for extending knowledge, technologies, and \nskills to nongovernment organizations (NGOs), local communities, and farmers \nover larger areas; and  \n(v)  identify the constraints to adoption at farmer, community, institutional and policy \nlevels and suggest mitigation measures. \n \n6.  The proposed research is to be conducted at nine key sites identified by the consortium \npartners and which represent the six problem environments: (i) drought in India and Thailand; \n(ii)  submergence  in  Bangladesh  and  India;  (iii)  salinity  in  India  and  the  various  upland \nenvironments in eastern India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Philippines. The seven participating \ncountries belong to three regional groupings of ADB: Greater Mekong subregion, South Asia, \nand Southeast Asia.  \n \n7.  Purpose. It is believed that the relevance and impact of rice research in the unfavorable \nrain-fed environments will be enhanced if researchers understand and adopt the farmers' \nlivelihoods perspective. The challenges that the predominantly subsistence farmer households \nface in these environments are meeting household food security first, and then improving their \nlivelihoods. A farm household that is able to get an assured rice supply for domestic needs \nwould only then be able to diversify into other on-farm and nonfarm activities. Therefore it is \nimportant that rice technologies introduced to farmers not only increase and stabilize yields, but \nalso reduce time, land, labor, and input resources, thus releasing these resources for other \nincome-generating activities.  \n \n8.  In  the  highly  diverse  conditions  in  rain-fed  areas,  farmers  also  need  to  be  given \ntechnology options to select those best suited to their needs, and not prepackaged technologies \nand blanket recommendations. This approach adopted by CURE requires researchers to work \nclosely with extension staff, local communities, and farmers to test out best-bet varieties and \nmatch crops that fit the rice crop management practices. This also provides scientists direct ", "  Appendix 3  31 \nfeedback for refining their technologies and better insight into further research needs and gaps, \nand at the same time, allows farmers to better understand the technologies.   \n \n9.  The experiences gained and achievements accomplished at the pilot sites need to be \nreplicated  and  extended  to  larger  areas  facing  similar  production  challenges.  Therefore, \nresearch  findings  will  be  \u201cdistilled\u201d  into  easily  understandable  terms,  decision  rules,  and \noperational principles for wider dissemination. Simultaneously, the capacity of NARES, NGOs , \nand local communities to internalize these new ways of conducting research and linking with \nextension  and  rural  development  needs  to  be  improved.  This  approach  requires  new \npartnership  and  organizational  arrangements  among  institutions  that  tend  to  be  more \naccustomed to sectoral and discipline-based research and development (R&D) approaches. \nNew mechanisms and arrangements therefore need to be designed and promoted.  \n \n10.  Outputs. The expected outputs are as follows: \n \n(i)  feasible cropping innovations that combine complementary technologies (e.g., \nsuitable  varieties  and  matching  management  practices)  for  increasing \nproductivity and reducing risks in rice-based cropping systems developed and \nevaluated with farmers, and experiences shared across key sites of the target \nrain-fed environments; \n(ii)  knowledge distilled into decision tools, management principles, and operational \nguidelines  that  are  extension-ready;  extrapolation  domains  of  improved \nproduction systems identified;  \n(iii)  capacity of NARES for implementing integrative and participatory technology \ndevelopment and dissemination strengthened; and  \n(iv)  acceptability to farmers and viability of innovative rice-based production systems \nassessed  based  on  their  biophysical  performance  and  socioeconomic \ncircumstances,  and  policymakers  and  development  authorities  sensitized  on \nsupporting sector needs for their wider adoption. \n \n11.  Outputs (i) and (ii) constitute the tangible products targeted at farmers, while outputs (iii) \nand (iv) relate to other important stakeholders concerned with improving the welfare of the \nfarmers. The performance targets and achievement dates for these outputs are in the TA  \nframework  (Table  A3.1).  The  site-specific  outcomes  from  output  (i)  will  directly  benefit \nparticipating farmers at the key sites, while the up-scaled products of output (ii) constitute the \nregional public goods for  wider dissemination to other areas having similar problems. The \nproducts  include  technological  options  as  well  as  operational  guidelines  for  systematically \ndiagnosing  site-specific  problems  and  determining  the  most  feasible  among  alternative \npathways to tackle the problems. \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The proposed research will cover a spectrum of rain-fed environments, each having a \nparticular problem set and requiring different solutions. The specific research activities will differ \nfor each target area, but their common emphasis is on using a systems-oriented, integrative, \nand participatory approach. The outputs and performance targets as well as activity schedules \nare provided as supplementary appendixes. \n \n13.  In general, for output (i), the various research teams will inventory, develop, and refine \nrice technologies that  \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n(i)  integrate the use of appropriate varieties and matching practices (for nutrient, \nwater, weed and pest management) to increase productivity of the rice crop \nunder stress, and \n(ii)  are more efficient in using land, water, nutrients, and other inputs, thus allowing \nother crops and farming activities to be fitted within limited time windows. \n \n14.  Because the technology needs are different for the various rain-fed lowland and upland \nenvironments, the tasks under Activity 1.2 are listed for each of those environments. The tasks \nwere identified by the respective working group teams based on their understanding of the \nproduction constraints and main research issues arising from previous work and stakeholder \nconsultation. \n \n15.  At all key sites, we will encourage farmers and extension personnel to participate in \ntrying out and refining various technology options tailored to their specific conditions, and to \ncomplement  new  knowledge  and  ideas  with  sound  existing  practices  and  indigenous \nknowledge. Organizing networks of on-farm demonstrations and holding farmers\u2019 field days will \npromote  farmer-to-farmer  exchange  of  experiences  and  collective  actions  on  managing \ncommon and limiting resources, particularly water. \n \n16.  Linkages and Collaboration with Other Projects. Because this project focuses on \nconsolidating  and  mobilizing  rice  knowledge  to  solve  production  problems  in  the  rain-fed \nenvironments, it will need to draw on the rich body of scientific knowledge and products \ngenerated by other projects. Linkages will be made with several projects being or expected to \nbe undertaken by IRRI and NARES partners.  \n \n17.  These include the following: (i) a subproject of the Poverty Elimination Through Rice \nResearch Assistance project funded by Department for International Development (DFID) in \nBangladesh has developed salt-tolerant varieties for the coastal wetlands; (ii) an ongoing ADB-\nfunded project supporting breeding for iron-dense rice to reduce anemia has produced iron- and \nzinc-dense varieties that are also adapted to mineral-deficient soils;  (iii) an ongoing project on \ngene discovery funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development \n(BMZ) has identified genetic regions that confer better drought tolerance; and (iv) an ongoing \nRockefeller Foundation project is supporting screening methods for improving the grain yield of \nrain-fed rice under reproductive-stage drought stress. In addition, a 3-year project supported by \nthe International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) will start in late 2003 to accelerate \ntechnology adoption to improve rural livelihoods in the Eastern Gangetic Plains. The project will \nemploy participatory methods to di entify rural community needs and introduce a range of \ntechnological, institutional, and policy innovations targeted at the farmers, community, and local \ngovernment.  Technologies  developed  under  this  proposed  project  can  be  brought  further \ndownstream and adopted within a broader livelihoods context.  \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total project cost is estimated at $4.5 million equivalent (Table A3.2). It is proposed \nthat ADB provide on a grant basis $900,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding program to finance 20% of \nthe total cost. The remaining cost will be financed by the in-kind contribution of IRRI ($2.24 \nmillion equivalent) and NARS ($1.36 million equivalent) \n \n19.  The participating NARES will give in-kind support to the project by making staff and  \nfacilities  available  in  the  field.  IRRI\u2019s  in-kind  contribution  will  include  staff  costs,  research \nexpenses, facilities, and equipment at IRRI headquarters and liaison offices in the participating \ncountries. ", "  Appendix 3  33 \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  IRRI will be the Executing Agency (EA) for this Project and will nominate a project \ncoordinator to oversee, coordinate, and monitor implementation. Implementation arrangements \nwill largely follow those developed under CURE to ensure continuity and sustainability. These \ninclude the use of \n \n(i)  the  steering  committee  (SC),  which  comprises  high-ranking  NARES \nrepresentatives from all seven member countries and the IRRI deputy director \ngeneral for research. The SC will provide overall guidance, approve budgetary \nallocations  and  work  plans,  review  progress,  and  facilitate  institutional \ninvolvement within participating countries; \n(ii)  the Consortium coordinating unit (CCU) that serves as the secretariat for the \nCURE. The CCU will coordinate raising of funds, provide administrative support, \nand facilitate communication among the working groups (WGs);  \n(iii)  six WGs that have been established to coordinate WG activities in the various \ncountries and sites. Each WG is headed by a working group leader and each site \nhas a site coordinator, who is a key researcher from the institution hosting the \nsite. The host institution will continue to make available research personnel and \nfacilities, provide logistical support for WG activities, and liaise with other partner \ninstitutions working at the site.  Team members for each WG will come from \nNARES,  IRRI  and  other  IARCs,  Advanced  Research  Institutions  (ARIs),  and \nNGOs. IRRI's research staff will provide scientific inputs into the various WGs. \n \n21.  Coordination will be through several mechanisms, starting with team site visits and \nparticipatory  planning,  charting  out  interlinkages  and  work  flows,  timely  communication  of \npreliminary and intermediate results, and holding team review sessions both in the field and in \nmore structured review meetings. This implementation arrangement, which was put in place \nrecently with the formation of CURE, will be evaluated and adjusted as necessary. However, \nCURE appears to be well poised to provide the mechanism for implementing this integrative \napproach where national and international researchers work closely with farmers and other \nstakeholders. \n \n22.  Research planning and review meetings will be held annually at which annual reports \nand results will be presented and plans for the coming season discussed. A workshop will be \norganized within the first 3 months of the project\u2019s start to explain the project operation, develop \nand agree on work plans, and firm up monitoring and reporting systems. At the end of the \nproject, a completion workshop will be organized to take stock of progress made and coordinate \nnecessary actions for ensuring the sustainability of the results.  \n \n23.  IRRI as the EA will submit to ADB a progress and financial report every 6 months based \non the reports provided by the NARS teams from the participating countries. In addition, IRRI \nwill submit semiannual financial statements and annual audited statements detailing the use of \nthe project funds. Within 3 months of project completion, IRRI will also prepare and submit to \nADB a final report describing the results of the project, the use of ADB funds, and strategies for \nsustaining the work in the future. \n \n24.  The goods, services, and other items of expenditure required for carrying out the project \nwill be procured in accordance with arrangements and procedures satisfactory to ADB, including \nthe Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, as may be amended ", "34  Appendix 3 \nfrom time to time, or through other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. \n \n25.  Project monitoring will be guided by the logical framework approach. The planned \nactivities for this project are in accord with the work plans of the WGs that were approved by the \nCURE steering committee in May 2003. Each research team will use supplementary project \ndesign and management tools, such as Gantt and PERT charts, to coordinate the component \nactivities of the various team members, track progress, and make adjustments as and when \nneeded. WGs will hold at least one review and planning workshop each year, and will report  \nprogress at the annual CURE steering committee meeting, when the next year\u2019s work plans will \nalso be tabled for approval.  \n \n26.  The scientific merit and achievements of the project will be evaluated during IRRI\u2019s \ninternal annual review and evaluation of individual scientists and of Program 3 on Improving \nProductivity and Livelihoods for the Fragile Rice Environments. The project\u2019s achievements will \nalso be included in IRRI\u2019s annual reports, including that of the director general to the CGIAR \nand the aid community. Parallel reporting in the respective annual reports of participating \nNARES institutions is expected. \n \nD.   Potential Project Impact and Constraints \n27.  The expected benefits of the project are as follows: \n \n(i)  To  resource-poor  farmers  and  rural  communities  in  the  rain-fed \nenvironments of Asia. By using rice technologies that are more resource-\nefficient and precisely targeted to the specific environments, poor farmers will \nhave an assured supply of their food staple while freeing more of their meager \nresources for other income-producing activities. \n(ii)  To the unfavorable environments as a whole. Improved ways of managing \nland and water resources to increase productivity will, in the long run, check \nexpansion  and  reverse  degradation  of  affected  areas.  At  the  gross  scale, \nincreasing  food  production  in  low-producing  or  otherwise  unused  areas  will \nrelieve the pressure for intensifying food production in the favorable areas, which \nface increasing competition from urbanization and with other economic sectors \nfor dwindling land and water resources. \n(iii)  To participating NARES. Through participation in research activities and also in \nspecially designed training programs, NARES capacity for implementing both \ndiscipline-based research and interdisciplinary approaches will be strengthened. \nWe expect that the NARES partners of CURE will become national centers with \nenhanced capacity for rice research in the rain-fed environments. As national \ncenters, they will be able to attract national and external resources to continue \nand sustain R&D efforts in the unfavorable environments, and also participate on \nequal footing in regional activities. \n \n28.  Attaining  an  effective  level  of  coordination  for  interdisciplinary  and  interinstitutional \ncollaborative research is among the biggest challenges of this project, especially as team \nmembers are located in different countries and are subject to many other demands on their \nprofessional  time  from  their  respective  institutions.  The  CURE  mechanism  is  designed  to \nfacilitate  collaboration  in  the  best  possible  way.  Other  potential  constraints  are  listed  as \nassumptions and risks in Table A3.1.

Accelerated rural development is central to the national economic development and \neven political stability of Asia\u2019s most populous countries. These are also the countries for which \nfish farming, largely based on carp production to feed local poor consumers, is or is becoming a \nmajor  industry.  WorldFish  Center  and  partners  from  the  most  important  carp-producing \ncountries in the world (all Asian) propose a technical assistance project that addresses a \nfundamental  farming  need  in  an  efficient  and  sustainable  manner,  namely,  disseminating \nimproved  carp  strains,  recommending  national  approaches  to  strain  maintenance  and \ndistribution, farm testing the new strains, and upgrading national technical capacity. \n \n2.  Previously WorldFish Center (formerly known as ICLARM \u2013 The WorldFish Center) and \nits partner institutes in Asia applied quantitative genetic methods for improving tilapia fish under \nthe  projects  Genetic  Improvement  of  Farmed  Tilapia  (GIFT)  (partially  funded  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) regional Technical Assistance (RETA) 5279), and Dissemination and \nEvaluation of Genetically Improved Tilapia in Asia (DEGITA) (funded by ADB RETA 5558). The \nimproved tilapia developed under these projects (popularly known as GIFT fish) gained more \nthan 80% in growth rate in five generations, resulting in increases in yield and profit margins of \nfish farmers and in improving the welfare of poor rural households.  Encouraged by the results \nof the GIFT and DEGITA projects, WorldFish Center and six carp-producing, ADB developing \nmember  countries  (DMCs)  developed  a  proposal  for  ADB  consideration  to  implement  a \ncollaborative project on the genetic improvement of carps in Asia. ADB approved a collaborative \nproject for implementation in two phases. Phase 1, a technical assistance grant2 (RETA 5711), \ntook place between 1 June 1997 and 31 December 2000. \n   \n3.  The results of phase 1 have been impressive. Research, development and technology \ntransfer priorities were identified, genetic resources (species, strains) were evaluated, and \ngrowth rate for some of the priority species was improved.  Surveys were conducted on \napproximately  2,000  fish-producing  households  and  5,000  fish-consuming  families. \nApproximately  350  farmers  were  trained  in  fish  farming  techniques  and  management.  \nImprovement programs were initiated and initial results show that growth of carps can be \nimproved by at least 10% per generation.  To sustain the gain achieved in phase 1, the \nimprovement of priority species of carps has to continue. Because of requests by participating \nDMCs, WorldFish Center approached ADB to seek funding for phase 2 of the project under \nADB\u2019s RETA program for the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. \n \n4.  The present proposal is supported by a strong socioeconomic framework that ensures \nthat the outputs will result in poverty reduction.  The project impacts at a number of levels\u2014the \nnational strategies for disseminating improved fish, education of farmers and their standard of \nfish management, genetic merit of the carp strains used in farmers\u2019 production systems, and \neducation of Asian scientists working in aquaculture and genetic improvement.  The strategy \n                                                 \n1  In the context of this paper, improved carp strains are strains that have greater productivity and were developed \nusing the naturally occurring variation within the species. Note that the process does not involve the transfer of \ngenes from one species to another. \n2   ADB. 1996.

Issues \n \n5.  The supply difficulties experienced by capture fisheries in Asian developing countries are \nbeing partly counterbalanced by increased aquaculture production. Most aquaculture production \nin Asia is consumed locally, and local demand is predicted to keep expanding during the next \ndecade.  In 2000, the Food and Agriculture Organization stated that \u201cAs an inexpensive source \nof a highly nutritious animal protein, aquaculture has become an important factor for improving \nfood security, raising nutritional standards, and alleviating poverty, particularly in the world\u2019s \npoorest countries.\u201d \n \n6.  Carps are the single most important group of fish contributing to world aquaculture \nproduction.  They account for nearly 50% of world production, and about 98% of cultured carp \nproduction is in Asia.  Among people with low incomes, carps are favored because of their \nappealing taste and low price.  In some Asian locations, carps are the main source of animal \nprotein.  Carp aquaculture production has grown by 12% per year during the past decade, \nwhereas production from capture fisheries has been declining at an average rate of 1% per \nyear.  About 13.5 million metric tons (t) of carp is produced annually in Asia by aquaculture and \nthe average value per kilogram of the product is about $0.60.  From the results of phase 1 of the \nproject Genetic Improvement of Carp Species in Asia, we may confidently assume that in well-\ndesigned breeding programs the genetic gain per year in growth rate is approximately 10%.  \nEven under the very conservative assumption that the improved carp strains increased carp \nproduction by only 5% in the first year of dissemination, the economic gain would be around \n$40.5 million.  If an additional 5% were added each subsequent year, the benefit would be \naround $600 million in the fifth year (Table A4.1)3.  Despite the very conservative nature of the \nassumptions made, the calculations indicate that the adoption of improved carp species has the \npotential to substantially increase food security and to reduce poverty incidence in Asia. \n \nTable A4.1: Estimated Impact of the Genetic Improvement of Carp \nPeriod  Production Increase  Economic Benefits \n(t mn)  ($ mn) \nYear 1  0.0675  40.5 \nYear 2  0.2025  121.5 \nYear 3  0.4050  243.0 \nYear 4  0.6750  405.0 \nYear 5  1.0125  607.5 \n    Mn = million; t = ton. \n    Source: ICARDA \n \n7.  Phase  1  of  the  project  was  successful  in  laying  the  foundations\u2014establishing  the \nimproved strains\u2014for a prosperous carp industry in the six countries involved in the project. \nHowever, the efficient use of such strains requires some essential knowledge to ensure that the \nstock is adequately maintained, multiplied, disseminated to farmers, and effectively utilized in \nthe production system.  Building the capacity of the farmer, hatchery manager (government or \nprivate), and national technical staff should receive considerable attention for the project to \nprogress toward the desired impact on the livelihood of small fish farmers and for continuity.  \n                                                 \n3  This calculation does not consider any reduction in price of carp due to the increase in production. Given the fact \nthat the price elasticity of demand for fish is relatively elastic, a price reduction due to adoption of improved carp \nfish is unlikely.  ", "  Appendix 4  43 \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Purpose and Output \n8.  In the proposed phase 2 of the project, the gains achieved during phase 1 will be \naugmented and extended to important areas that will directly impact on farmers\u2019 well-being in \nthe short, medium, and long term.  The earlier carp project (phase 1) developed well, but fish \nbreeding work needs a longer time to have its full impact on farmers\u2014impact that can only be \ndemonstrated by a substantial dissemination phase encompassing established breeding and \nbreed multiplication programs and on-farm tests of fish performance.  Such dissemination takes \ntime and resources beyond that which have so far been invested. To ensure continuity beyond \nthis project support, WorldFish Center has to demonstrate the advantages of farming improved \nfish  to  Government,  non-Government  operators,  and  farmers.  On  the  basis  of  these \nconsiderations the proposal for phase 2 of the project was formulated. The TA framework is in \nTable A4.2 \n \n9.  The  general  output  of  the  proposal  is  improved  nutritional  status  and  economic \nconditions of fish farmers from Bangladesh, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), India, Indonesia, \nThailand, and Viet Nam through the culture of improved and superior carp strains. The specific \noutputs are the following: \n \n(i)  National selective breeding programs are established and consolidated in six \nAsian countries\u2014Bangladesh, PRC, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n(ii)  Maintenance and further improvement of carp strains continue.  \n(iii)  Improved strains of carps are tested under farmers\u2019 conditions. \n(iv)  National strategies for disseminating improved carps to poor fish farmers are \ndesigned and implemented.  \n(v)  Improved carp stains are disseminated, and fish farmers and hatchery managers \nare trained in farm management and use of improved fish. \n(vi)  Capacity of national agriculture research and extension system (NARES) staff to \ndevelop improved carp strains is enhanced. \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  methodology  of  this  project  is  highly  participatory,  involving  farmers,  hatchery \nmanagers, and national NARES and private enterprise staff in all phases of its execution.  The \nkey activities are described in paras 11.15. \n \n11.  Testing Improved Fish in Farmers\u2019 Fields.   On-farm trials will be conducted to \ncompare the improved fish  with the local or traditional fish currently marketed.  Farmer and \nnational  staff  involvement  in  the  plan,  design,  and  conduct  of  these  trials  is  essential  to \nmaximize the credibility of results and technology adoption. \n \n12.  Maintenance and Further Improvement of the New Strains.   The strain improvement \nprograms in the six Asian nations need support to become mature national breeding programs, \nwith the necessary continuity to achieve impact at the farm level.  The required inputs are \ninvestment in additional physical facilities; technical competence to control reproduction in carps \nand to identify families and individual fish; and support for data capture, processing, and genetic \nevaluation. \n  ", "44  Appendix 4 \n13.  Dissemination.  A  detailed  survey  of  carp  hatchery  operations,  brood  stock \nmanagement, and fish seed distribution systems will be conducted in each participating DMC.  \nAn analysis of existing institutional structure for carp aquaculture research and extension, \nincluding the role of the private sector, will also be made.  Based on these analyses, national \nstrategies  for  disseminating  improved  carp  strains  to  farmers  will  be  developed  in  close \ncoordination with the NARES in the DMCs.  Generally,  dissemination  strategies  include  a \ncentral breeding station responsible for maintaining the breeding population and doing selective \nbreeding.  Dissemination starts when improved fish are distributed, for each generation of \nselection, from the central breeding stations to governmental and (or) private fry producers \n(multiplier hatcheries). These specialized fry producers then reproduce the fry for dissemination \nto fish farmers. WorldFish and implementing partners will intensify efforts in disseminating \nimproved carp strains.   \n \n14.  Assessment  of  Potential  Economic,  Social,  and  Environmental  Impacts  of \nImproved Breeds.  The impact of the adoption of improved carp strains on the socioeconomic \ncondition of stakeholders (e.g., fish producers, fish consumers, traders, landless laborers) and \non the environment (including fish biodiversity) will be assessed.  The impacts on poverty \nreduction, food security, equity, and sustainability will also be assessed. Information collected \nas part of the on-farm testing of improved carp strains will be used as input in the impact \nassessment. From the results of the impact assessment analysis, strategies and options will be \nidentified to assist the poor fish farmers of DMCs to adopt improved carp strains.  \n \n15.  Capacity Building.  The capacity of farmers and hatchery managers to use aquaculture \ntechnology and improved fish strains in the production system will be enhanced. For NARES \ntechnical staff (researchers and extension workers), the focus will be on animal breeding and \ngenetics.  Selected staff from partner countries will attend courses organized by WorldFish \nCenter  staff  on  the  design  of  a  breeding  program,  complex  genetic  analyses,  statistical \nmodeling, and techniques of molecular genetics applied to marker-assisted selection.  The \ngroup of scientists trained at a more advanced level will become leaders in the field and will \ntrain others. \n \n16.  The  outputs  and  performance  targets,  and  the  activity  schedules  are  provided  as \nsupplementary appendixes. \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at $1.65 million equivalent.  It is \nproposed that ADB provide $0.95 million on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program to \nfinance 58% of the total cost. The remaining cost will be financed by the in-kind contribution of \nWorldFish Center ($0.4 million equivalent) and NARS ($0.3 million equivalent) to cover office \nand  administrative  costs,  counterpart  technical  staff  costs,  and  maintenance  of  research \nfacilities.  A breakdown of the cost estimates is given in Table A4.3. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  WorldFish Center will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the project, and the national \naquatic  resources  research  and  development  agencies  in  the  participating  DMCs  will  be \nimplementing partners.    The project will have its main office at WorldFish Center headquarters \nin Penang, Malaysia.  The collaborating institutions are Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute \n(Bangladesh),  Bureau  of  Socioeconomic  Research  and  Training  (Bangladesh),  Freshwater \nFisheries Research Centre (PRC), Indian Council of Agricultural Research\u2013Central Institute for ", "  Appendix 4  45 \nFreshwater Aquaculture and Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute\u2013(India), Agency for \nMarine and Fisheries Research (Indonesia), Department of Fisheries\u2013Aquatic Animal Genetics \nResearch and Development Institute and Fisheries Economics Division\u2013(Thailand), and Ministry \nof  Fisheries\u2013Research  Institute  for  Aquaculture  No.  1\u2013(Viet  Nam).    WorldFish  Center  will \nappoint a project team coordinator. Each collaborating DMC agency will also appoint a national \nteam coordinator for its component of the work.  In addition, WorldFish Center will recruit and \nappoint two international consultants on an individual basis from project funds: one to oversee \nand conduct the genetic works, and the other to take charge of the socioeconomic studies. In \naddition, two support staff and five postdoctoral fellows will be financed by the project. National \nteams will be responsible for specific research, and technology transfer in the field.  All activities \nwill be coordinated with those of the International Network on Genetics in Aquaculture (INGA). \n \n19.  The detailed work plan will be finalized in the inception workshop that will take place \nwithin 3 months of the start of the project.  During implementation, WorldFish Center will submit \nto ADB a progress and financial report every 6 months based on reports of the NARES teams \nfrom the participating countries.  In addition WorldFish Center will submit semiannual financial \nstatements and annual audited  statements detailing the use of the project funds. The EA will \nsubmit to ADB a comprehensive completion report within 3 months of project completion. \n \n20.  Toward the end of the project, a 5-day regional workshop will be held to review project \nachievements  and  to  outline  the    strategy  to  ensure  continuity  of  the  selection    and \ndissemination activities beyond the present ADB and WorldFish Center project. The outcome \nwill be presented to ADB. The workshop will recommend sustainable approaches to ensure the \ncontinuity of the improvement programs initiated in the present project.  Support on highly \nspecialized technical matters will be available from two sources: (i) INGA, hosted by the \nWorldFish Center; and (ii) the Breeding and Genetics Center, an initiative currently being \ndeveloped by WorldFish Center. \n \n21.  WorldFish Center will procure goods and services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, as may be amended from time to time, and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants.  \n \n22.  A  number  of  monitoring  processes\u2014government statistics, progress reports, special \nsurveys, and process documentation\u2014will be used to measure  project performance.  The \ndissemination of carp that are superior to the general carp population, as well as the resulting \nincrease in production, will be monitored through government statistics when possible.  In \naddition, socioeconomic surveys will be conducted to document increases in income and in per \ncapita  animal  protein  intake  at  the  farm  level.    Local  staff  and  farmer  perception  of  the \ntechnology will also be assessed via surveys.  Technical documents and papers will report on \nthe differences between the improved carp and the local varieties previously used.  The country-\nspecific reports will describe the technical details of the improvement programs.  The outcomes \nof workshops and training activities conducted for the project will also be reported, soon after \nthe events take place.  Semiannual technical and financial reports to ADB will inform of project \nprogress, and will culminate in a final report. \n \nD.  Potential Project Impact \n23.  Relation of the Project to ADB Priorities.  The project conforms closely with ADB\u2019s \noverarching development objective of poverty reduction in DMCs in the following ways: \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \n(i)  It will contribute to economic growth. \n(ii)  The benefit will occur immediately and will be sustainable. \n(iii)  Social capital will be developed. \n(iv)  Environmental quality will be enhanced. \n(v)  Quality of governance will be promoted. \n(vi)  Social protection will be ensured. \n \n24.  Expected Benefits (Social, Economic, Environmental) from the Project.  Consistent \nwith  the  approach  followed  in  phase  1,  the  present  proposal  is  supported  by  a  strong \nsocioeconomic framework. Considered together, both phases encompass a wide range of \nactivities, starting with an assessment of market requirements, development of high-yielding \nstrains, evaluation under different farming conditions, quantification of the impact of improved \nstrains, and development of mechanisms for disseminating improved strains to ensure that the \noutputs result in poverty reduction. The project impacts at a number of intermediate levels in the \npathway leading to poverty reduction: development of national strategies for disseminating \nimproved fish, education of farmers and their standard of fish management, the merit of the carp \nstrains used in farmers\u2019 production systems, education of Asian scientists working on carp \nimprovement, soundness of the selective breeding programs in each participating country, and \nsustainability of the benefits derived by farmers from the improvement program. WorldFish \nCenter has held international consultations on the environmental impact of improved strains and \non building mechanisms for disseminating improved strains. It is helping the countries in this \nproject develop guidelines for environmentally safe dissemination of improved carp strains.   \n \n25.  Potential for Adoption and Processes to Use to Ensure Adoption.  The results of \nthe project are highly likely to be adopted because the technology at the root of increased carp \nproductivity is low cost, sustainable, and of proven effectiveness; and the benefits will be \ndemonstrated  in  on-farm  trials  involving  all  relevant  sectors  (farmers,  government  policy \nmakers, research and extension officers, private enterprise).  The likelihood of adoption will be \nmaximized by creating a chain of actions that culminates in impact on the ultimate beneficiaries, \nnamely the poor fish farmers and consumers who grow the improved stock and eat its products.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  47 \nTable A4.2: Technical Assistance Framework \nWorldFish Center \n \n     \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumption and Risks \nTargets \nGoals        \n1.

Introduction \n1.  It is well recognized that within rural Asia, agriculture provides home and livelihood to the \nmajority of the region\u2019s poor; therefore, improving agriculture and natural resources is critical to \nany poverty reduction efforts. It is essentially on this premise that the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has been investing in agricultural research and development for almost three decades \nand harnessing the knowledge and expertise of the international agricultural research centers \n(IARCs) to assist developing member countries (DMCs) with technologies, planting materials, \nand training. From 1995, ADB has provided grant funds to the IARCs through an umbrella \nregional technical assistance of about $5 million per annum. In the last few years however, this \nassistance has been shrinking, largely due to increased competition for limited grant funds \nwithin ADB. It is imperative therefore, that the work of the IARCs be seen in the context of the \ncountry\u2019s and region\u2019s priorities and programs, and that the linkage between their outputs and \nADB\u2019s overarching goal of poverty reduction be clearly presented.  \n \n2.  The efforts to streamline ADB\u2019s contribution to agricultural research began with the \npreparation of background papers on funding agricultural research and discussions among the \nmembers of the Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development Sector Committee. The \noutcome of the meeting was presented to all regional directors of agriculture, environment, and \nnatural resources, to seek their views and develop a strategy to enhance the quality and focus \nof the IARCs\u2019 work and the synergy between it and the priorities of the country/region/ADB. One \ndecision of these deliberations was that detailed guidelines should be prepared to reflect ADB\u2019s \nexpectations from IARCs in project preparation, implementation, impact, and follow-up. These \nguidelines were formulated, reviewed, and finalized in March 2003, and circulated to the IARCs, \nwith  the  approval  of  the  Director  General  of  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment. \n \nB.  Issues \n3.  Previous meetings among the agriculture, environment and natural resources divisions \nhave pointed to a strong need for greater interaction among the IARCs, the national agricultural \nresearch systems (NARSs), and ADB to ensure that research activities funded by ADB regional \ntechnical assistance (RETAs) reflect the sector priorities of the region and the output of efforts \nbecomes linked with national programs and ADB\u2019s operational portfolios.  \n \n4.  Research and new technologies are an integral part of agriculture growth and strategies \nin most DMCs, and yet there is little institutionalized interaction between the IARCs working in \nthe region, the country sector planners, and operational staff of ADB. The proposed forum will \nprovide contributing agencies, particularly ADB, an opportunity to explain their planned lending \noperations in the regions and also explore opportunities to build linkages with IARCs in future \noperations. \n \n5.  Concerns have also been voiced about the need to evaluate and improve the impact and \neffectiveness of ADB support to the IARCs and NARSs, and it is expected that the proposed \nworkshops with IARCs and the country stakeholders in a common forum will yield feedback and \nprovide an opportunity for discussing possible improvements and new directions. \n ", "54  Appendix 5 \n6.  To address these needs, regional forums on agriculture and natural resources research \nare proposed to be established to facilitate discussion, dissemination, and collaboration among \nnational and international agriculture research centers and the country sector planners. The \nforums are expected to enhance understanding and use of the work being done by research \ninstitutions,  facilitate  greater  sharing  of  information  among  all  research  and  development \npartners, and build collaboration and synergy in their work programs. The agriculture and \nnatural research (ANRR) workshops  will present an excellent opportunity to promote among \nADB mission leaders, IARCs, and national stakeholders a broad-based awareness of the ANRR \nRETA program, including the benefits of and opportunities for incorporating the RETA findings \ninto ADB\u2019s regional and country programs.  \n \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The key objectives of the proposed TA are to (i) advance the process of regional and \nsubregional cooperation in agriculture by sharing information and successful technologies, (ii) \nreinforce  partnerships  and  commitment  among  IARCs,  NARSs,  and  ADB  so  as  to  focus \nagricultural research on eradicating poverty. The TA framework is in Table A5.1. \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  To start this effort in 2004, it is proposed that two regional forums under the eighth RETA \nbe established and activated: one in Central Asia and the other in South Asia. Workshops will \nbe organized in the two regions to bring the key sector operators on one platform to promote \ndialogue and flow of information among the national policy and program planners, NARSs,  \nIARCs,  and  country/project  staff.  The  workshops  are  expected  to  highlight  significant \nachievements, benefits, and contributions of research funded by ADB and other organizations \nand strengthen the commitment to agricultural research. Discussions in the workshops will focus \non (i) learning about ongoing and planned sector development and research activities in the \ncountries,  (ii)  determining  the  key  sector  priorities  for  the  region/countries, (iii) identifying \ntechnical and financing gaps in planned interventions in key areas, and (iv) developing an \nintegrated and coordinated work program. Two meetings are planned in 2004. The details will \nbe worked out in consultation with the participating countries in Central and South Asia.  The TA \nwill support these meetings and fund national consultants to provide advisory and technical \nsecretariat  services  before  and  during  the  summit,  and  finance  the  publication  and \ndissemination of workshop materials. ADB will take the lead for the program, organization, and \nconduct of the workshops in the two regions.  \n \n9.  The main output of the workshops will be a joint statement by the IARCS, the NARSs, \nand ADB focusing on future directions, challenges, and commitments to achieving a shared \nvision and goals. The topics to be discussed will include emerging trends, factors, and issues in \nthe global and regional environment that could impact on agricultural growth. The TA will \nsupport  this  forum  to  facilitate  exchanges  of  views  on  regional  and  global  trends  with \nimplications for the agriculture sector. An open discussion of these trends could benefit from \ninputs by agricultural research practitioners who are prime movers of cutting-edge research in \nAsia and the NARSs and who will be tasked with voicing their national priorities and concerns.  \n \n10.  The TA components will consist of (i) preparatory meetings for the ANRR workshops, (ii) \ntwo  regional  workshops  on  coordinating  and  disseminating  of  agriculture  research  and ", "  Appendix 5  55 \ndevelopment  in  the  Central  and  South  Asian  regions,  and  (iii)  publication  of  workshop \noutcomes. \n \n11.  Preparatory Meetings for the ANRR Summits (Component 1). Two to three meetings \nare envisaged between the ANRRD Committee and the working groups (WGs) constituted for \nthis  purpose.  The  WGs  will  consist  of  staff  from  concerned  departments,  and  selected \nrepresentatives from IARCs/NARSs. The meetings will discuss and finalize (i) the program for \nthe ANRR forums; (ii) broad based  participation; (iii) topics to be addressed; (iv) strategic \nprogram  for  disseminating  RETA  results;  and  (vi)  logistical  arrangements  for  the  ANRR \nworkshops\u2014protocol, travel, and related conference arrangements. The TA will finance these \npreparatory activities and meet the full cost of the meeting including the costs incurred in travel, \nif any, by the participants. \n \n12.  Coordination and Dissemination Workshops (Component 2). ADB proposes to take \nthe  lead  in  establishing  regional  forums  for  sharing  information  and  discussion  among \nagricultural research and development partners to promote mutual understanding, and enhance \nthe use of international agriculture research outputs. The proposal is to initiate two forums in \n2004 for Central and South Asia and organize workshops at agreed upon venues in the two \nregions. The workshops are expected to start the process of dialogue and coordination among \nthe IARCs, NARSs, aid agencies, and the country sector managers, and facilitate mutual \nunderstanding and collaboration among them. The workshops will support learning and flow of \ninformation among international and national research centers to permit full use and adoption of \ntechnology, capacity building, and inclusion of country priorities in the agricultural research \nagenda of IARCs. The regional forum will bring together research scientists and staff from the \nconcerned regional department and promote sharing of information on the ongoing work and \nthose  in  the  pipeline.  The  forum  is  therefore  expected  to  enhance  operational  links  and \nsynergies between national and international research institutions and the aid community.  \n \n13.  Publication  and  Dissemination  of  Processes  and  Outcomes  (Component  3). \nOutputs of the two ANRR workshops will be developed and disseminated to staff, IARCs, the \nconcerned NARSs, government officials of the Central and South Asia regions, and other \nconcerned stakeholders. Lessons learned from this first initiative and the framework developed, \nif any, will also be put together to guide similar initiatives in other regions and countries. \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $150,000, to be financed by ADB on a grant basis from \nADB's TA funding program. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Table A5.2. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will implement the three project \ncomponents. Within ADB, the Agriculture, Natural Resources and Social Sectors Division, \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department will ensure successful completion of the \nproposed project activities and will nominate a project officer to discharge this responsibility. A \nWG will be constituted to guide in planning and organizing the ANRR workshops. The WG will \ncomprise nominated representatives from each of the regional departments, thematic sectors, \nand other concerned departments. It will also include representatives of select IARCs and \nNARSs. A RETA secretariat will be established with a project officer\u2014supported by a full-time \ntechnical assistant\u2014who will coordinate and administer the preparatory and organizational work \nfor the workshops. ", "56  Appendix 5 \n \n16.  An  individual  international  consultant  (agriculture  research  specialist)  serving  for  1 \nperson-month will be commissioned to design the approach and methodology of the workshops \nand to prepare discussion drafts for the proposed meetings. An individual domestic consultant \n(technical assistant, 6 person-months) will be engaged to assist in administering the workshops \nand preparing the reports, as necessary. Two resource persons will be identified and invited to \nreview and comment on the approach, methodology, and terms of reference of the proposed \nworkshops.1 The resource persons will also assist in the regional workshops and will closely \ncoordinate with ADB in finalizing the overview reports.  \n \n17.  The specific responsibilities of the international agriculture research specialist are the \nfollowing. \n \n(i)  Work  with  the  project  officer  and  the  WG  in  designing  the  approach  and \nmethodology of the regional workshops. \n(ii)  Initiate contact with concerned staff, IARCs, NARSs, and government agencies \nto start the comprehensive consultation process for the workshops. \n(iii)  Review relevant literature and documents on agricultural research, including \ninformation  from  ADB's  previously  funded  research  projects  and  activities, \nexperience of relevant IARCs, and other sector studies and policy papers. \n(iv)  Review ADB's past performance in agricultural research in Central and South \nAsia and recommend options and discussion points that should be highlighted in \nthe workshops. \n(v)  Undertake any other tasks assigned by the Project Officer. \n \n18.  The domestic technical assistant will have these responsibilities. \n \n(i)  Help plan and organize meetings and activities for the ANRR summits: prepare \ndraft correspondence, budget, and meeting venues, and provide overall logistical \nsupport. \n(ii)  Help prepare the publications for the ANRR summits: edit, incorporate, and \npublish  the  main  conclusions  and  recommendations  of  the  summit  as  an \noverview report. \n(iii)  Assist in coordinating with the relevant IARCS and NARSs staff in Central and \nSouth  Asia  regarding  the  substantive  and  logistical  requirements  for  the \nmeetings. \n(iv)  Ensure the smooth flow of communications and documents between the IARCs, \nNARSs, and concerned ADB staff. \n(v)  Monitor and compile news/articles (print and the Internet) relevant to agricultural \nresearch and the ANRR summit. \n(vi)  Coordinate the distribution of publications and other relevant materials to the \nsummit participants and to the media. \n(vii)  Provide overall logistical support to the ANRR summit and related meetings. \n(viii)  Assist in preparing resource persons\u2019 and participants\u2019 materials for distribution \nand presentation in meetings and workshops. \n(ix)  Assist with travel and accommodation arrangements of the TA team, resource \npersons, consultants, and participants invited to the consultation workshop. \n(x)  Handle assignments for data collection and summary presentations. \n                                                 \n1  The resource persons will be drawn from the academe, IARCs, NGOs or the private sector and must demonstrate \ndistinguished credentials in the field of agricultural research.
