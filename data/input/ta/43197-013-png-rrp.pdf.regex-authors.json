I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Port Moresby Power Grid Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  reduce  fossil  fuel  consumption,  increase  access  to,  and \nimprove network reliability of the Port Moresby power grid. The project will assist PNG Power \nLimited  (PPL)  in  expanding  renewable  energy  generation,  connecting  currently  unserved \ncustomers,  and  significantly  improving  the  quality  of  electricity  supply.  The  project  will \n(i) upgrade  and  rehabilitate  two  hydropower  plants  (Rouna  1  and  Sirinumu  toe-of-dam); \n(ii) extend the grid to approximately 3,000 additional households, including strengthening the \ndistribution network; and (iii) construct a new substation (Kilakila) and upgrade the existing \nsubstations. Project preparatory technical assistancewas utilized in project preparation.2 \n \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Port Moresby is the largest urban center in PNG, with a population of 318,000 (2011) \nand is expanding rapidly thanks to ongoing strong economic growth. Port Moresby has the \nlargest stand-alone power grid in PNG, with 47% of the national installed generation capacity, \n48% of the national households connected to grid-based electricity, and a peak load of about 97 \nmegawatts (MW).3 Load demand for the Port Moresby grid has increased significantly and \ndemand is expected to keep rising, fuelled by high economic growth related to continued growth \nin the gas and mining sector and associated industries. By 2018, peak demand is anticipated to \nincrease by 30% (annual average of 6%). The Port Moresby grid is currently fed by diesel \ngeneration (41%) and the Rouna Hydropower Cascade (59%).  \n \n4.  Renewable energy (hydropower) has historically supplied most of the power for the Port \nMoresby  grid.  In  1994\u20131995,  hydropower  from  the  Rouna  cascade  (installed  capacity  of \n60 MW)4 accounted for 76% of power generation for Port Moresby. By 2010\u20132011 however, due \nto  increasing  demand  and  deferred  rehabilitation  of  the  Rouna  cascade,  the  share  of \nhydropower  in  the  energy  mix  had  fallen  to  59%,  with  diesel  generation  filling  the  gap.5 \nMaximizing  the  use  of  renewable  energy  (primarily  hydropower)  is  important  to  the  PNG \neconomy, as it (i) reduces fossil fuel imports; (ii) lowers the cost of power generation and \nthereby eases the pressure on power tariffs, which in turn benefits the private sector and \nreduces household expenditure; and (iii) improves energy security. Utilization of renewable \nenergy also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming. To meet \nprojected medium- to long-term demand growth, additional hydropower for the Port Moresby \ngrid is to be generated by the Naoro-Brown hydropower project (60 MW). The government is in \nthe initial stages of assessing options for public\u2013private partnership financing of the Naoro-\nBrown hydropower project, supported by a technical assistance loan from the World Bank. \nHowever, since large hydropower plants require long planning and construction lead times, \nthere  is  an  urgent  need  for  investments  in  the  Rouna  cascade  to  (i)  secure  immediate \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Preparing the Port Moresby Grid Development Project. \nManila. \n3  PPL has 87,772 customers nationwide, of which 41,692 are in Port Moresby.  \n4  Rouna 1: 3.5 MW (rated), Rouna 2: 30 MW (rated), Rouna 3: 12 MW, Rouna 4: 13.2 MW, Sirinumu: 1.5 MW. \n5  Diesel generation involves medium-speed diesel generators at Kanudi (24 MW) and Moitaka (31.2 MW), and gas \nturbine peaking units at Kanudi (30 MW) and Moitaka (18 MW) operating on diesel but convertible to gas. ", "2 \nrehabilitation of the hydropower infrastructure, (ii) meet immediate demand, (iii) offset the need \nfor further short-term investment in diesel generation, and (iv) reduce reliance on high-cost \nimported  fossil  fuels.  Refurbishing  the  existing  infrastructure  is  considered  the  least-cost \noption\u2014the levelized cost of energy from a rehabilitated Rouna 1 hydropower plant is estimated \nat  $0.10\u2013$0.16  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  compared  with  a  levelized  avoided  cost  of  diesel \ngeneration of $0.45/kWh.  \n \n5.  Improving access to energy is a major developmental priority for PNG. In recognition of \nthe low access rates across the country, the PNG Development Strategic Plan, 2010\u20132030 has \nestablished a national target of 70% access by 2030.6 Increasing access will involve extending \nexisting grids in urban and peri-urban areas, establishing mini-grids to service isolated urban \nand rural population centers, and expanding individual power systems such as household solar \nsystems and solar lanterns for isolated households and villages. Expansion options hinge on \nhow power will be utilized and on least-cost delivery. Typically, peri-urban areas have a greater \nneed for grid-connected power due to greater potential for economic activity, while demand from \nrural areas relates to low-usage activities such as lighting and communications. The proposed \nproject focuses on extending the grid to currently unserved areas in urban and peri-urban areas \nof Port Moresby. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is also assisting access expansion to \nprovincial urban and rural areas, but in separate interventions.7 The access rate in urban and \nperi-urban areas of Port Moresby is estimated at 69%. The project is targeting grid extension to \nan estimated 3,000 low-income households in these areas, which will increase the access rate \nto 74%.  \n \n6.  Lack of access to reliable power is limiting economic growth and hindering private sector \ndevelopment.  A  sample  survey  of  75  households  conducted  under  technical  assistance \nassociated with this project, found that 100% of them experienced frequent disruptions in power \nsupply and extended blackouts. Of the sampled households, 35% were using power to also run \nsmall businesses. Improvement of power supply will enhance the quality of life and reduce \npoverty  by  encouraging  low-income  families  to  engage  in  small-scale  income  generation \nactivities, e.g., sale of cooked and refrigerated items, and by improving street illumination to \nreduce  criminal  activity.  Thus,  investments  in  the  Port  Moresby  grid  transmission  and \ndistribution infrastructure are essential to (i) step up hydropower system efficiencies and reduce \nthe need for diesel power generation, (ii) reduce loss of revenue from high system losses, (iii) \nreduce costs to the private sector, and (iv) improve the quality of life of residential customers. \n \n7.  Power outages on the Port Moresby power grid are becoming more and more frequent. \nThe average annual duration of power outages per customer (customer average interruption \nduration index) is 124 hours per annum. This is high compared with the Pacific-wide average of \n10 hours per annum.8 Power disruptions are due to overloaded substations, lack of generation \ncapacity, and non-optimal grid configuration. Because of the unreliability of power supply, there \nis  considerable  self-generation  and  back-up  generation  capacity  in  urban  areas,  which  is \nmaintained and operated at low efficiencies and high cost to businesses. \n \n                                                \n6  Government of PNG, Department of National Planning and Monitoring. 2010.

The Port Moresby power grid is owned and operated by PPL, a 100% state-owned \nenterprise. The government's ownership in PPL is maintained through the Independent Public \nBusiness  Corporation  (IPBC).  Sector  policy  formulation  is  managed  by  the  Department  of \nPetroleum and Energy and, specifically, by the Energy Division. PPL operates two main grids \n(Port Moresby and Ramu), which are not interconnected, and 26 smaller urban centers through \n19 separate power systems. Power tariffs in PNG are independently regulated by the Consumer \nand Competition Commission and allow full cost recovery for PPL. Electricity tariffs are currently \nK0.8147/kWh ($0.39/kWh) for residential customers with the first 30 kWh/month at a lifeline tariff \nof K0.4794/kWh ($0.23/kWh). Greater grid efficiencies and replacement of diesel generation \nwith hydropower generation will ease pressure on power tariffs in the medium to long term.  \n \n9.  The proposed project is in line with (i) ADB's country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nPNG,9 which prioritizes energy as an area of support, and (ii) the PNG Development Strategic \n  \nPlan, 2010\u20132030 [footnote 6], which gives priority to the improvement of power supply. The \n \ngovernment approved the electricity industry policy in 2011, which recognizes the (i) low level of \nelectricity access, (ii) unreliability of electricity supply and subsequent economic impacts, (iii) \nhigh costs for the private sector arising from the supply gaps, and (iv) difficulties faced by PPL in \nraising capital for infrastructure investments. The proposed development of the PNG power \nsector, including the Port Moresby grid, is detailed in PPL's 15-year power development plan. \nThe outputs of the project are included in PPL's 5-year business plan. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  will  be  more  economic  activities  undertaken  by  PPL's  residential  and \nbusiness customers. The outcome will be better power supply for Port Moresby.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The outputs of the project are as follows: \n(i)  Hydropower upgrade and rehabilitation. This consists of (a) upgrading the \nRouna 1 hydropower plant (6 MW), and (b) rehabilitating and upgrading the \nSirinumu toe-of-dam hydropower plant (1.6 MW). After upgrade and rehabilitation, \nthe two plants will provide 13% of the renewable energy, or 3.6% of the total \nenergy, for the Port Moresby grid.  \n(ii)  Upgraded distribution grid. This entails (a) extending the grid to an estimated \n3,000  additional  households, 10  (b)  upgrading  the  existing  11-kilovolt  (kV) \ndistribution  grid,11 and  (c)  implementing  a  loss  reduction  program.12 It  is \nestimated that the project will connect 5% more households in Port Moresby \n(generally from poorer areas) and boost the access rate from 69% to 74%.  \n(iii)  Upgraded substation capacity. This consists of (a) constructing a new Kilakila \nsubstation, (b) a 6.1-kilometer (km) transmission line (66 kV), and (c) retrofits to \nexisting substations. It is estimated that the project (distribution and substation \nupgrades) will reduce average outage duration for customers by 42% (by 80% \nwithin the central business district), contributing markedly to better power supply. \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2010.

Manila.   \n10 This includes step-down transformers; distribution lines; house connections; and provision of minimum supply kits, \nincluding prepayment meters.  \n11 The distribution grid will be converted from a radial grid to a mesh grid to improve system reliability and efficiency, \nand reduce system losses. \n12 Current system losses are estimated at 22%.  \n ", "4 \n(iv)  Project management and capacity building. This consists of establishing a \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  that  will  provide  efficient  technical  design, \nmanagement, and supervision services.  \n \nD.

The government has requested a loan of $51.7 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR). The OCR loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \ncustom-tailored  repayment method,  an  annual  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft guarantee and \nloan agreements. The repayment dates will be 1 June and 1 December. Based on this, the \naverage loan maturity is 13.8 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per \nannum.  \n \n14.  The  government  has  also  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR9,787,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources\u2014i.e.,  the  Asian  Development  Fund \n(ADF)\u2014to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as set forth \nin the draft loan agreements. The government will relend the proceeds of the OCR loan and the \nADF loan to PPL under subsidiary loan agreements acceptable to ADB. The terms for relending \nthe proceeds of the OCR and ADF loans will include the same interest rates and repayment \nperiods that apply to the loans themselves. The financing charges during construction on the \nOCR and ADF loans will be capitalized.  \n \n ", "5 \n15.  The government will finance the remainder of the overall project cost in the amount of \n$16.3 million, including local taxes and duties.

Implementation Arrangements \n16.  IPBC will be the executing agency and PPL will be the implementing agency. A PMU will \nbe established within PPL for implementing the project. PPL will provide the following full-time \nPPL staff: (i) two project engineers, (ii) a land officer, (iii) an environment officer, (iv) a finance \nofficer,  (v)  a  procurement  officer,  (vi)  a  surveyor,  (vii)  two  line  engineers,  and  (viii)  an \nadministrative assistant. The project will finance additional consultants, equipment, and office \nfurnishings to help the PMU implement the outputs. Consulting firms will be engaged using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 (considered justified \ndue to the technical complexity of the power grid upgrades). Consultants may also be recruited \nthrough  individual  consultant  selection  (considered  justified  given  the  difficulties  in  finding \nconsulting companies with the broad technical spread required, and a limited pool of consultants \nwith required technical and country expertise). All consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The \nPMU will be responsible for contracting all consulting services, equipment, and civil works. A \nproject steering committee will oversee implementation, monitor progress, and provide guidance \nto the executing agency. The committee will meet at least quarterly and will be chaired by the \nDepartment of National Planning and Monitoring. PMU will host the steering committee and act \nas the secretariat. \n \n17.  The project will be implemented over 4 years, with completion estimated by January \n2017. To expedite implementation, the government has requested and ADB has approved \nadvance procurement action and retroactive financing for eligible expenditure up to a maximum \nof 18% of the ADF loan and 18% of the OCR loan, incurred before loan effectiveness, but not \nmore  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan  agreement.  ADB  has  informed  the \ngovernment that approval of advance procurement action and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to finance the project. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table \n3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.13 \n \n                                                \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "6 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2013\u2013January 2017 \nEstimated completion date  July 2017 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Port Moresby Grid Development Project Steering Committee: \nDepartment of National Planning and Monitoring (chair)  \nDepartment of Petroleum and Energy, Department of Treasury, \nIPBC, and PPL (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  IPBC \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  PPL \n(iv)  Implementation unit  The project management unit will be established within PPL, with \n10 full-time PPL staff and 12 international consultants (intermittent)  \nProcurement  ICB   7 contracts  $53,130,000 \nNational competitive  1 contract   $500,000 \nbidding  \nShopping  3 contracts  $95,000 \nCQS   2 contracts  $155,000 \nConsulting services  QCBS   91 person-months  $4,080,000 \nICS  2 contracts   $350,000 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Retroactive financing for up to 18% of ADF and 18% of OCR loan \nadvance contracting  proceeds  \nAdvance contracting for ICB, shopping, CQS, QCBS, ICB, and ICS. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and \nADB.  \nADF = Asian Development Fund, CQS = consultants\u2019 qualifications selection, ICB = international competitive bidding, \nICS = individual consultant selection, IPBC = Independent Public Business Corporation, OCR = ordinary capital \nresources, PPL = PNG Power Limited, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n18.  The  proposed  substation  and  distribution  grid  upgrades,  and  the  upgrade  and \nrehabilitation of the hydropower plants have been assessed to be technically viable. Extensive \nmodeling  has  been  completed  to  determine  the  optimum  technical  configuration,  including \nanalysis of alternative substation locations, hydropower turbine size configurations, penstock \narrangements,  and  distribution  configurations  to  maximize  system  efficiencies.  The  project \ndesign was based on extensive PNG experience to ensure that the proposed systems are \nsuitable for local conditions, and the operation and maintenance requirements are compatible \nwith  utility  capacity to ensure sustainable operation.  Alternative  designs  were  assessed  to \nensure a least-lifecycle-cost design.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n19.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the consolidated project is 17.9%, with a \nproject  economic  net  present  value  of  $30.2  million.  This  compares  favorably  with  ADB\u2019s \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The access expansion program, in particular, has a \nhigh and robust EIRR of 21.9% that justifies the project despite the low financial viability of \nsome project elements (Table 4).  \n ", "7 \n \n20.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the consolidated project is 10.2%, with a \nproject financial net present value of $146.2 million. This compares favorably with the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  2.0%  and  indicates  that  the  project  as  a  whole  is  financially \nsustainable. \n \n Table 4: Financial Analysis Summary  \nFIRR   FNPV  EIRR   ENPV \nComponent \n(%)  ($ million)  (%)  ($ million) \nOutput 1: Hydropower upgrade and rehabilitation       \n1.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for increases in \neconomic and financial costs, as well as a reduction of economic and financial benefits. Both \nFIRR and EIRR are robust to cost increase and benefit reduction.14  \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  Financial management. A financial management assessment was completed for PPL, \nincluding a review of the accounting and reporting system, internal and external auditing, fund \ndisbursement, and information system.15 The assessment indicated that while PPL's financial \nmanagement is generally satisfactory, improvements could be made in the areas of internal \ncontrol relating specifically to account reconciliation procedures, prevention of re-statement of \naccounts at regular intervals, and integration of systems into the Oracle-based accounting \nsystem. PPL is now dealing with these issues, and they are not anticipated to impact PPL's \nmanagement of the project. Design and supervision consultants will provide support.  \n \n23.  Procurement capacity. A procurement capacity assessment was completed for PPL. It \nindicated that PPL has significant experience procuring goods and services and has sufficient \nprocurement experience and human resources to manage procurement for the project, including \nthe preparation of bidding documents, evaluation of technical proposals, and monitoring of \ncontract performance. The assessment found some areas that require realignment to comply \nwith ADB systems: (i) lack of specific technical specification or bill of quantities and price \n                                                \n14 A more detailed description of the parameters considered is in the Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (both \naccessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila; ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence A \nMethodology Note. Manila. \n ", "8 \nschedules, (ii) bid-opening procedures, (iii) procurement method contract value thresholds, and \n(iv) lack of a complaints procedure. Based on this risk evaluation, the PMU will include an \ninternational procurement specialist who will train PPL staff in preparing tender documents and \nmanaging the preparation of ADB tender documents. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, IPBC, and PPL. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration manual. PPL\u2019s asset management procedures were assessed and considered \nsufficient to operate and maintain the assets under the project.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  Social. The project aims to connect 3,000 households out of an estimated 17,800 non-\nconnected households in the poorer peri-urban villages of Port Moresby. Access to electricity \nwill (i) reduce household chores such as collecting firewood, which is mainly done by women; \n(ii)  replace  kerosene  lighting  with  a  cheaper  form  of  energy,  thereby  freeing  household \nexpenditure; (iii) improve children's education; and (iv) reduce indoor health and safety issues \nassociated with burning firewood and kerosene. The project is also expected to provide more \nreliable power supply to broader residential areas, including poor areas in Port Moresby. Better \npower supply will enhance the quality of life of Port Moresby residents by (i) reducing now-\nregular power outages for residents; (ii) encouraging low-income families to engage in small-\nscale income generation activities such as selling cooked and refrigerated items, which is now \nnot possible due to regular extended power outages; (iii) improving street illumination to reduce \ncrimes; and (iv) improving the water supply to residents, which is disconnected during regular \nextended power outages.  \n \n25.  Gender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender \naction  plan  has  been  prepared for  project  implementation  and monitoring.  Gender  actions \ninclude (i) prioritizing households headed by women for connection to the grid; (ii) undertaking \ntraining workshops in newly connected communities (at least 50% female participation) on \nelectricity  safety,  operation  of  prepayment  meters,  energy  efficiency,  and  household  utility \nbudgeting;  (iii)  conducting  training  workshops  in  five  communities  (at  least  50%  female \nparticipation) on using electricity for income generation; (iv) fostering women's participation in \ncommunity consultations (at least 40%); (v) including at least one woman on the grievance \nredress  mechanism  committee;  (vi)  requiring  contractors  to  pay  equal  wages  to  men  and \nwomen for work of equal value, providing female workers with sanitation facilities, and including \nwomen in labor-based work (at least 20% women workers); (vii) ensuring that women\u2019s wages \nare paid directly to them; (viii) conducting gender awareness training for contractors, the PMU, \nand PPL management; and (ix) including an international social and gender specialist to support \nthe PMU.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  Environment. The project overall has been classified as category B for environment \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). An initial environmental examination has \nbeen prepared for each component. The main potential environmental impacts will arise from \nland clearing, earthworks, dust, noise, tree trimming, sourcing and transportation of materials, \nconstruction traffic, waste disposal and discharges, cleaning and refurbishment of hydropower \nplants,  and  minor  upgrade  of  an  access  road.  The  results  of  the  initial  environmental \nexaminations will be integrated into the bidding documents for each component and if there are \nscope changes, an updated environmental examination and environmental management plan \n ", "9 \nwill be compiled by the PMU and approved by ADB. As part of the assessment, a climate \nchange adaptation risk evaluation was conducted and considered in the infrastructure design.16 \n \n27.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The project does not involve physical displacement of people or \nstructures,  but  requires  acquisition  of  about  5.47  hectares  of  customary  land  for  the  new \nsubstation and transmission line, affecting 198 families (744 individuals). A land acquisition and \nresettlement plan has been prepared for the new substation and transmission line site. A due \ndiligence  report  has  been  prepared  for  existing  sites  (including  Rouna  1  hydropower  and \nSirinumu toe-of-dam hydropower). PPL will update and finalize the resettlement plan and due \ndiligence  report  prior  to  project  implementation.  PPL  will  coordinate  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation activities with government and nongovernment agencies. Due diligence carried \nout under project preparatory technical assistance has confirmed that there will be no impact on \ndistinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples. Consultation with affected persons has been carried \nout  during  project  preparation.  The  draft  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  has  been \ndisclosed on the ADB website.  All updated safeguard documents will be endorsed by the \ngovernment, disclosed to affected persons and local stakeholders and posted on ADB website. \nThe project will support capacity within PPL to manage safeguard aspects through international \nand national environment and social safeguard specialists, who will be working within the PMU. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 The risks have been assessed and the \nbenefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n  \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nShortage of civil works contractors.
