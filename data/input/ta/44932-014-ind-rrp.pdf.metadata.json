I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans in \nthe aggregate amount of up to $100 million to Chattel Constructions Private Limited (Chattel), \nGanges Green Energy Private Limited (Ganges), Hiraco Renewable Energy Private Limited \n(Hiraco),  Responsive  Sutip  Limited  (Responsive),  Sand  Land  Real  Estate  Private  Limited \n(Sandland), and Ujjawala Power Private Limited (Ujjawala), which are special purpose vehicles \n(SPVs) [confidential information deleted] for the 145 Megawatts Grid-Connected Solar Project in \nIndia.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  [confidential information deleted] is one of India\u2019s leading solar power developers. The \nproject consists of an aggregate 145 megawatts (MW) of grid-connected photovoltaic solar \npower  projects  to  be  installed  by  third  quarter  of  2012  at  six  locations  in  Gujarat  state. \n[confidential information deleted] is developing solar projects domestically and internationally as \nboth a developer and developer-operator. The group\u2019s development strategy is to develop a \ntotal portfolio of 1,500 MW by FY2017. \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been engaged with [confidential information] \ndeleted]  since  July  2009  in  helping  to  identify  a  group  of  projects  that  have  a  strong \ndevelopment impact. [confidential information deleted] has demonstrated its execution strategy \nin commissioning 145 MW in India and 65 MW in Europe, as well as raising equity capital to \nfund  its  project  pipeline  of  135  MW  under  construction  and  over  425  MW  under  early \ndevelopment. Successful execution of these initial projects establishes [confidential information \ndeleted]  as  an  experienced  developer  of  solar  projects.  ADB\u2019s  approach  in  financing  six \nsubprojects, totaling 145 MW of grid-connected solar power generation, is to demonstrate the \nbenefits of scale: financing and developing an aggregate set of projects to reduce construction \nmobilization,  financing,  and  management  overhead  costs.  This  approach  maximizes  the \ndevelopment impact by enabling a private sector developer to deliver clean energy to the \nregional grid at a sustainable tariff. \n \n2.  Project Design \n4.  The project entails the construction of five 25 MW and one 20 MW solar photovoltaic \npower generation plants, totaling 145 MW, across six locations in Gujarat state. The project \nsites are generally within a 150-kilometer radius of the cities of Ahmedabad, Porbandar, and \nRajkot and readily accessible by public roads. The annual global horizontal irradiance2 across \nthe six subproject sites is estimated to be 2,014\u20132,062 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter, \namong the strongest in the country. \n \n5.  The project will use a mix of crystalline silicon (105 MW), amorphous silicon (10 MW), \ncadmium  telluride  (20 MW),  and  tandem  junction  amorphous  silicon (10  MW)  photovoltaic \npanels across the six subproject sites on fixed-tilt mounting structures, with one subproject site \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Measure of the intensity and availability of sunlight in a given location, which can be converted to electricity either \nthrough photovoltaic solar panels or concentrating solar thermal power technology. ", "2   \n(Chattel) employing some single-axis manual tracking structures adapted to site conditions. \nPanels will be supplied by DuPont Apollo (United States), First Solar (United States), Hanwha \nSolarOne (People\u2019s Republic of China), LDK (People\u2019s Republic of China and India), Moser \nBaer (India), and Trina (India). The mixture of panel technologies and suppliers was chosen \nbased on optimum cost and schedule delivery criteria. The solar photovoltaic modules are \nguaranteed for a maximum degradation of 10% over the first 10 years of operation and 20% \nover the next 15 years of operation. \n \n6.  The electricity generated from each subproject will be evacuated to existing substations \nthrough  a  combined  total  of  about  45  kilometers  length  of  66  kilovolts  double-circuit \ntransmission lines to be built by Gujarat Electricity Transmission Company. \n \n3.  The Borrowers and Sponsor \n7.  [confidential information deleted],   \n \n8.  [confidential information deleted]is developing a number of projects across India as part \nof its group strategy. In addition to the solar projects being developed under the [confidential \ninformation deleted]is developing over 11,560 MW of conventional and hydroelectric generation \ncapacity. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n9.  The project is designed to promote sustainable economic growth by diversifying India\u2019s \nenergy mix through the addition of renewable energy capacity. The development impact of the \nproject also includes environmental benefits through more efficient use of indigenous renewable \nenergy resources with almost no emission of pollutants or greenhouse gases. In addition, the \nbuilding of the project will help prove the feasibility of utility-scale solar power projects in India \nand the operational performance in a location (Gujarat) where substantial development in solar \npower is planned during 2012\u20132017. \n \n2.  Outcome \n10.  The  project  will  demonstrate  the  profitability  and  sustainability  of  a  variety  of  solar \nphotovoltaic technologies at utility scale on a private generation basis in India by generating \nabout 208,000 megawatt-hours3 of clean energy per annum while delivering adequate returns \nfor the private sponsor. \n \n3.  Outputs \n11.  Successful implementation of the project will result in the construction and operation of \nutility-scale solar photovoltaic power generation facilities. \n \n                                                 \n3  Average energy production per annum over the life of the project. \n ", "  3\nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n12.  The project supports two of the five core operational areas of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020: \ninfrastructure and environment.4 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s India country partnership \nstrategy (CPS), 2009\u20132012. One of the four strategy pillars of the CPS is to support inclusive \nand environmentally sustainable growth through continued focus on infrastructure development \nand enhanced focus on renewable energy. The project is consistent with one key outcome \nindicator of the CPS, which targets an addition of at least 70 MW of solar power generation \nthrough ADB assistance by 2012.5 \n \n2.  Consistency with the Energy Policy and the Asia Solar Energy Initiative \n13.  Under ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, ADB\u2019s investments will focus on energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy projects, as well as expansion of energy access. The policy states that \nsupport for renewable energy projects will be prioritized and broadened, with an objective to \ncreate a framework that makes investing in renewable energy commercially viable. The policy \nenvisages that, in the process of facilitating private investments in renewable energy, ADB will \nassume greater (but thoroughly assessed) risks and act as a catalyst for investments that the \nprivate sector might not otherwise be willing to make.6 \n \n14.  The project is directly aligned with ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative, which aims to (i) \nfacilitate knowledge sharing for solar power; (ii) help develop, finance, and commission 3,000 \nMW of solar power generation capacity by May 2013; and (iii) pilot test innovative financing \nmechanisms  specifically  for  solar  power.  The  initiative  seeks  to  stimulate  solar  power \ndevelopment by increasing economies of scale to reduce costs and improve solar energy\u2019s \ncompetitiveness within the grid and exploiting solar radiation resources to serve fast-growing \nelectricity demand. \n \n3.  Consistency with ADB Operations \n15.  The project strongly complements ADB\u2019s current initiatives in solar energy in India. In \n2011, the ADB Board of Directors approved the guarantee facility for Solar Power Generation,7 \nwhich will issue partial credit guarantees in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million \n(or its equivalent in Indian rupees or other foreign currency acceptable to ADB), in favor of \nforeign and local commercial financial institutions (partner commercial banks) lending to solar \npower generation projects in India. The facility will support multiple solar generation projects up \nto a maximum capacity of 25 MW under a solar power program with the central or state \ngovernments.  This  facility  will  catalyze  commercial  lending  and  private  investment  for  the \nsmaller solar generation projects, while the project aims to catalyze private investment in larger \nsolar  generation  projects  with  a  capacity  greater  than  25  MW.  This  highlights  ADB\u2019s \nmultiproduct approach to promote private investment in solar energy and its ability to customize \nbased on market needs and associated risks. In a similar manner, the project will promote the \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008.

Implementation Arrangements \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements8 \nAspects  Arrangements \n  \n  \nRegulatory framework  Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission implemented a requirement that all \ndistribution  licensees  in  Gujarat  must  purchase  0.5%  of  their  total  electricity \nrequirements from solar energy sources during FY2011. This renewable purchase \nobligation increased to 1.0% for FY2012. The Gujarat Urja Vikas  Nigam Ltd \nmaintains budgetary means to pay up to a quantum equivalent of the additional \ncost of 1,000 megawatts capacity of solar generation per year above the market \ndispatch rates. \nImplementation period  The anticipated commercial operations date (COD) for all projects is 31 December \n2012. The life of the power purchase agreements is 25 years from COD. \nConstruction arrangements   \nEngineering, procurement, and  On the basis of international competitive bidding, [confidential information deleted] \nconstruction   has entered into fixed price turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction \n(EPC) contracts with Moser Baer Engineering and Construction Limited (MBECL) \nfor (i) procurement and supply of foreign and domestic equipment; and (ii) erection, \nconstruction, and services for the project. The lenders\u2019 independent engineer \nvalidated that the EPC contract is consistent with industry norms and was entered \ninto on a commercial arm\u2019s length basis. \nEquipment supplier  Under the EPC contracts, [confidential information deleted] will source the thin film \nand crystalline solar modules from DuPont Apollo (United States), First Solar \n(United States), Hanwha SolarOne (People\u2019s Republic of China), LDK (People\u2019s \nRepublic of China and India), Moser Baer (India), and Trina (India). Inverters are \nsourced from Bonfiglioli (Italy) and SMA Electronics (Germany). \nCivil works  Civil works for the balance of the plant (including construction of common facilities, \ncontrol room, and approach road) are subcontracted to local trade contractors. \nTransmission line  Each power generation plant is planned under the Solar Power Policy of the state \nof Gujarat under which the specific provision for power evacuation is made by the \nstate government. The power evacuation facilities will be provided by Gujarat \nEnergy Transmission Corporation Limited. \nOperations arrangements    \nRevenue structure  [confidential information deleted] has entered into power offtake contracts with \nGUVNL  to sell 100% of the output of each power plant generation for a period of \n25 years at a fixed rate of Rs11.25 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for the first 12 years \nand Rs7.5 for the following 13 years. \nOperation and maintenance  Each plant will enter into an operation and maintenance agreement with MBECL \nunder terms considered standard practice in the market. The contract is valid for \n10 years with the option to extend based on satisfactory performance. \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators will be reported by [confidential information deleted] \nand monitored by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In addition, during the \nconstruction phase, ADB will appoint an independent lenders technical advisor to \nmonitor progress, attend performance testing, and certify COD. \nSource: [confidential information deleted]. \n                                                 \n8  Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  5\n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n17.  The proposed ADB loans in the aggregate amount of up to $100 million to Chattel, \nGanges,  Hiraco,  Responsive,  Sandland,  and  Ujjawala  to  finance  the  construction  of  each \nsubproject  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  without  government \nguarantee. The ADB loan will have a tenor of up to 15 years, including a grace period of up to 6 \nmonths and will be repaid quarterly. The ADB loan will carry an interest rate as well as other \nfees as approved by ADB\u2019s investment committee. Up to $50 million of the ADB loan will be \ndisbursed in Indian rupees via a 15-year cross-currency swap. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n18.  The proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  The project will promote the efficient use of a relatively untapped, indigenous \nenergy resource resulting in low-cost, carbon-efficient electricity generation. \n(ii)  The ADB assistance will provide long-term, limited recourse financing, which is \nnot readily available for large solar power generation projects in India. This will \nbe ADB\u2019s first private sector solar financing in India where the majority of finance \nis from local commercial banks, which, because of the shorter tenors, would not \nhave been sufficient to provide the financing needs of the project without the \nlonger tenor ADB financing. \n(iii)  ADB participation in the project will help promote global standards for project \ndevelopment and due diligence in a nascent sector, thus enabling long-term \ncommercial financing for future solar power generation projects in India. \n \nC.  Risks \n19.  Sponsor support.  The loans will have limited recourse to [confidential information \ndeleted for debt service obligations of the subprojects.   \n \n20.    Tariff risk. The tariff is established in accordance with the Central Electricity Regulatory \nCommission renewable energy tariff regulations of 2009, which are in effect until 31 March \n2013. The applicable tariff is Rs11.25/kWh ($0.20/kWh) for the first 12 years of operation, \nstepping down to Rs7.50/kWh ($0.13/kWh) beyond year 12. This tariff regime is locked in for the \nproject if commercial operations date (COD) is achieved by 31 March 2013. Delay risk is well \nmitigated by the advanced stage of completion of the project. \n \n21.   Offtaker risk. The project\u2019s sole offtaker, GUVNL, has a local currency rating of A from \nCARE Ratings. Another domestic ratings agency, CRISIL, in a report prepared for the Forum of \nRegulators, identified that solar RPO purchases in Gujarat will be only 239 million kWh out of \n95,582 million kWh by 2015. This results in an incremental impact (over conventional sources) \non total power purchase costs of only about Rs0.01/kWh in 2015 and later, indicating low risk of \nofftaker default on RPO tariffs. In the same period, conventional power purchase costs are \nestimated to rise from Rs2.72/kWh to Rs3.36/kWh.  \n \n22.  Operation and maintenance (O&M) risk. Each project contracted MBECL to perform \nO&M services to mitigate O&M risk. \n ", "6   \n \n23.     Foreign exchange risk. Fifty percent of the ADB loan will be denominated in US dollars, \nbut the project revenues will be in Indian rupees. The US dollar tranche, however, comprises  \nonly 12.5% of  total project funding sources. The sponsor guarantees any debt service shortfalls \ncaused by foreign exchange movements [confidential information deleted].   \n \n24.  Tenor. The ADB loan will have a tenor of up to 15 years. While the term of the energy \npurchase agreement is longer at 25 years, the long tenor of the loan further accentuates the \ntechnology and foreign exchange risk. These risks are mitigated by the hedging and support \nmechanism  and  the  step-down  in  tariff  after  12  years,  which  reduces  the  risk  of  tariff \nrenegotiation by the offtaker. \n \n25.  Implementation and technology risk. Construction risk is substantially mitigated by the \nadvanced stage of construction. The module technology is crystalline and amorphous silicon \nand  cadmium  telluride,  which  are  common  technologies  with  a  long  record  of  reliable \nperformance. Unique local conditions such as high ambient air temperatures and high levels of \ndust and soiling could impair module performance but performance warranties provided by each \nsupplier and conservative forecast of energy yields mitigate this risk.  \n \n26.     Related party contracting risk. CRISIL was appointed to independently manage the \nselection  of  EPC  contractor  and  equipment  supplier.  For  each  subproject,  Moser  Baer \nEngineering and Construction Limited (MBECL) had the most competitive bid, with module \nsupplies  coming  from  DuPont  Apollo  (United  States),  First  Solar  (United  States),  Hanwha \nSolarOne (People\u2019s Republic of China), LDK (People\u2019s Republic of China and India), Moser \nBaer (India), and Trina (India) [confidential information deleted]. \n \n27.  Interest rate risk. The interest rate for the US dollar-denominated portion of the loan is \na fixed margin over the applicable 6-month US dollar London interbank offered rate (LIBOR). An \nincrease in the interest rate will increase the interest burden on the project and will reduce debt \nservice coverage ratios. The loan documentation will specify interest rate hedging strategies to \nmitigate this risk. Further, the sensitivity of the project cash flows to changes in the interest rate \nis low because of fixed interest rate Indian rupee loans from the swapped component of the \nADB loan and other domestic senior lenders. \n \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory  B  for  environment,  and  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples. The potential environmental and social impacts and risks of the project have been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. The institutional capacity and \ncommitment of each project company to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts \nand risks are deemed adequate. Information disclosure and consultations with affected people \nwere conducted in accordance with ADB requirements and a grievance redress mechanism is in \nplace.9 [confidential information deleted] will ensure that the project is in compliance with \n                                                 \n9  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  7\napplicable national laws and regulations and will implement and monitor measures to manage \nimpacts and risks, all in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n29.   Measures to benefit women or facilitate their involvement in construction and operation \nof the project have been incorporated in the project design in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender  and  Development  (1998).  The  project  companies  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy and report regularly to ADB on their compliance (including contractors) with \nnational  labor  laws  and  adherence  to  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.10 \nInformation disclosure and consultations with affected people were conducted in accordance \nwith ADB requirements (footnote 14). \n \n30.  The project companies will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and report \nregularly  to  ADB  on  their  compliance  (including  contractors)  with  national  labor  laws  and \nadherence  to  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards  (footnote  15).  Each  project \ncompany has formulated its own corporate human resources policy embodying the gender-\nrelated core labor standards. Information disclosure and consultations with affected people were \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements (footnote 14). \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n31.  [confidential information deleted] was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best \ninternational practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of \nterrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  loan  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n32.  The proposed loan is within the medium-term country, industry, group, and single project \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n33.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),11 the Government of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the \nproposed assistance to [confidential information deleted]. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the Board. \n \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n34.
