An initial environmental examination (IEE) has been \nAssessment  undertaken and the summary IEE is a supplementary appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The project  activities will cover four components. The first is \ncapacity building of a wheat-breeding institute and crop variety \ntesting  agency.  The  component  will  aim  at  accelerating  the \nrelease of new wheat varieties that are better suited for cultivation \nin Uzbekistan. The second will build the capacity of rural business \nadvisory  centers  (RBACs)  and  selected  research  institutes  to \npromote adoption of new wheat varieties and improve farming \npractices, particularly in crop rotation and on-farm soil and water \nmanagement. The third will provide credit funds and capacity-\nbuilding assistance for private enterprises that will produce wheat \nseeds  and  provide  farm  support  services  (farm  input  retailing, \nmachinery rental, and agroprocessing services). The fourth will \nsupport coordination of project activities and impact monitoring. \n \nThe first and second components will cover five wheat-producing \nprovinces  of  Tashkent,  Syrdarya,  Djizak,  Samarkand,  and \nKaskadarya in central Uzbekistan. Limited irrigation facility repairs \nunder the second component and enterprise development under \nthe third component will be carried out in three focus districts of \nKuyi-Chirchik, Zamin, and Katakurgan in Tashkent, Djizak, and \nSamarkand provinces, respectively. \n \nThe Project will also facilitate policy dialogue and monitoring to \ndeepen reforms in the agriculture sector, including reduction of the \nmandatory volumes of wheat and wheat seeds that farms are \nrequired to sell to the state in the focus districts. Complementing \nthe reduction of the public sector\u2019s purchases of wheat and wheat \nseeds, the Project will facilitate private sector participation in seed \nproduction, provision of farm inputs, and product processing and \nmarketing.  Reforms  introduced  in  the  three  districts  will  be \nexpanded nationwide in a phased manner. \n   \nRationale  To  secure  wheat  supply,  Uzbekistan\u2014a  remote  landlocked \ncountry  with  limited  physical  access  to  international  markets\u2014\nraised wheat output from 0.6 million to 4.7 million tons in 1993\u2013\n2002. With a domestic requirement of about 4.5 million tons, the \ncountry is self-sufficient in wheat. Despite the gains in output, the \nwheat subsector and the agriculture sector, in general, are facing \nkey challenges. First, aggregate wheat output is prone to sudden \ndrops because the wheat varieties cultivated in Uzbekistan are ", "iv \nsusceptible to local pests/diseases and not adapted to the local \nclimate.  Second,  the  increase  in  wheat  production  has  relied \nexcessively on wheat planting in fertile and well-irrigated lands, \nrestricting the available land for cultivation of higher-value crops. \nRigid state control over cropping patterns and marketing has also \nconstrained farm income growth.  \n \nTo  address  these  challenges,  and  increase  farm  income  and \nensure food security, Uzbekistan needs to rationalize its wheat \nproduction,  particularly  to  minimize  wheat  cultivation  where \nhigher-value  crops  can  be  grown.  Investments  should  also  be \nmade to stabilize and improve wheat yields, especially in the less \nirrigable  and  rain-fed  areas.  Three  critical  interventions  are \nneeded:  (i)  accelerate  the  introduction  of  wheat  varieties \nadaptable to local conditions, (ii) support agricultural extension to \nintroduce  sustainable  and  more  profitable  farm  practices  and \ntechnologies for wheat cultivation, and (iii) improve farm access to \nagricultural  support  services,  including  the  supply  of \nagrochemicals, farm machinery, and agroprocessing services. \n   \nObjective  The project objective is to promote economical and sustainable \nsystems of wheat production. Achievement of the project objective \nwill contribute to the realization of the project goal to improve farm \nincome. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $40.0 million equivalent, \ncomposed of $23.4 million in foreign exchange and $16.6 million \nequivalent in local currency. The cost estimates include taxes and \nduties amounting to $2.3 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  $ million equivalent\nSource    Foreign   Local  Total   Percent \n   Exchange  Currency   Cost \nAsian Development Bank  23.4  2.6  26.0  65\nGovernment  0.0  10.6  10.6  26 \nBeneficiaries  0.0  3.4  3.4  9 \n               Total  23.4  16.6  40.0  100 \n \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $26.0  million  from  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility; a commitment fee of 0.75% per annum; a front-end \nfee of 0.50% of the loan amount; conversion options that may be \nexercised in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement, \nADB\u2019s Loan Regulations, and Conversion Guidelines; and other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n   ", "  v \nAllocation and Relending  For the Project\u2019s agricultural enterprise development component, \nTerms  the Ministry of Finance (MOF), on behalf of the Borrower, will on-\nlend  $10.1  million  of  the  loan  proceeds  to  private  companies \nproviding diversified services to farms and producing wheat seed \nin  the  three  project  districts.  The  subsidiary  loans  will  be \nchanneled  through  a  maximum  of  two  participating  finance \ninstitutions (PFIs) to be identified during the first year of project \nimplementation, based on criteria agreed on between ADB and \nthe Borrower. Subsidiary loans from MOF to PFIs will be for 10 \nyears, including a 4-year grace period. Subloans from PFIs to the \nenterprises will be for 10 years, including a 3-year grace period. \nReal market interest will be applied to the subloans, taking into \naccount the cost of administering the subloans, credit risk, and \nreasonable amount of profit for PFIs. Commitment fees of ADB to \nMOF will be passed on to PFIs, which will bear the subloan credit \nrisks. Foreign exchange risk will be passed on to the enterprises. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 March 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A project steering committee, headed by a deputy prime minister \nArrangements  and comprising senior government staff, will be established to \nguide  project  implementation  and  monitor  project  development \nimpacts.  The  Rural  Restructuring  Agency  (RRA),  under  the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources,  will  execute  the \nProject. A project management office (PMO) has been established \nwithin RRA to manage the day-to-day project implementation, with \nproject site offices (PSOs) to be established in the three project \ndistricts  to  supervise  field  activities.  PMO,  PSOs,  and  district \ngovernments will work with the beneficiaries, wheat-breeding and \nagricultural research institutes, RBACs, and private enterprises. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Rural Restructuring Agency \n   \nProcurement  The  Project  will  procure  farm  machinery,  research  and  office \nequipment,  vehicles,  materials,  and  civil  works  services.  All \nprocurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  under  Asian  Development  Bank \nLoans. Procurement of goods and services under the subloans \nmade  out  of  loan  proceeds  will  be  carried  out  by  private \nenterprises.  The  subborrowers  need  to  demonstrate  that  their \nprocurement procedures are transparent, efficient, and conform \nwith ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide 31 person-months of international and 42 \nperson-months of domestic consultant services. The international \nconsultants will help (i) administer the Project, (ii) evaluate project \nimpacts, (iii) upgrade wheat plant breeding and variety testing, (iv) \ndevelop  effective  extension  services,  and  (v)  evaluate  the ", "vi \nsuitability  of  candidate  financial  institutions  to  take  part  in  the \nProject.  Domestic  consultants  will  help  organize  water  users \nassociations to strengthen irrigation operation and maintenance in \nthe project areas. Domestic consultants will also support capacity \nbuilding  in  extension  service,  project  impact  evaluation,  and \nevaluation of finance institutions. The engagement of consultants \nwill conform to Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements \nacceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project is expected to benefit 217,000 families in the project \nBeneficiaries  area, most of whom work on the private and cooperative farms \nand cultivate wheat on household plots. The Project is expected to \nincrease average wheat yields of irrigated farming systems from \n2.4 to 2.7 tons (t) per hectare (ha), and rain-fed wheat yield from \n0.6 to 1.0 t/ha in 7 years. In the three pilot districts, farm income is \nexpected to increase by 31-60% by 2008. Introduction of drought-\ntolerant  and  early  maturing  wheat  varieties,  combined  with \nenhanced soil fertility management in the dry areas, will increase \nyields, which, in turn, will increase demand for labor, particularly of \nwomen and young adults. Enhanced farm income will improve \ncommunities\u2019 access to social and health services and improve \nliving  conditions.  In  the  project  districts,  crop  price  reforms, \nstrengthened rural business advisory services, and private sector \nentry  into  agricultural  support  services  will  yield  robust  and \nsustainable growth in farm profits. The Project\u2019s economic internal \nrate of return is estimated at 31%. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  An advisory technical assistance (TA) grant will (i) support private \nsector entry and operations in seed production and provision of \nagricultural support services in the three project districts, and (ii) \nassist the Government in reviewing its food security strategy. The \nTA  will  help  demonstrate  the  benefits  of  competitive  private \nbusiness operations in agriculture. The TA is estimated to cost \n$600,000  equivalent,  of  which  $400,000  equivalent  will  be \nfinanced by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund. \nThe TA will provide services of 12 person-months of international \nand 15 person-months of domestic consultant inputs. \n   \n ", "v\n  ii", "   \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Grain Productivity Improvement Project. The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for furthering reform in the grain sector, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA.1  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Performance, Indicators, and Analysis \n2.  Crops comprise 60% of the value of agricultural output of Uzbekistan, with cotton and \nwheat as two major crop commodities. Cultivable land represents about 10% of the total land \narea, or 4.4 million hectares (ha), of which 3.7 million ha are irrigated, and the remaining, rain-\nfed. Some 16 million ha are grassland, which supports livestock production. Much agricultural \nproduction is concentrated in the irrigated areas of the central and eastern parts of the country. \nCultivable rain-fed areas are mostly used for grain production. About 56% of the country\u2019s 25.6 \nmillion people live in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for about 28% of the gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), 44% of employment, and 60% of export revenues.  \n \n3.  Under the former Soviet Union (FSU), Uzbekistan was a designated producer of cotton, \nwith 70\u201380% of the total irrigated land devoted to the crop. Fodder crops (alfalfa, rye, barley, \nand maize), which were grown in rotation with cotton, supported limited livestock production. \nProduction of staple crops, such as wheat and potatoes, was discouraged. Areas planted to \nfruits and vegetables were constantly reduced. Before 1991, Uzbekistan produced less than \n20% of the wheat it consumed, and the rural areas suffered food shortages. Wheat on average \naccounts for 85% of household consumption of staple foods in Uzbekistan,2 which comprise \nmostly of wheat, rice, and potatoes. \n \n4.  After independence in 1991, Uzbekistan\u2019s access to wheat became less secure because \nof the cessation of the centrally administered barter system under the FSU and a growing \ninstability of the region\u2019s economies. As a landlocked country with limited physical access to \ninternational markets, food security became a major concern, and Uzbekistan embarked on a \nwheat self-sufficiency program. From 1993 to 2002, aggregate wheat output grew from 0.6 \nmillion to 4.7 million tons. With domestic consumption estimated at 4.5 million tons, the country \nis becoming self-sufficient in wheat.3 An analysis of the agriculture sector is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Sector Challenges \n5.  Despite impressive gains in grain output, the agriculture sector faces key challenges. \nFirst, wheat production is still prone to sudden drops because the recent output growth has \nrelied on imported high-yielding wheat varieties (mostly from Russia) that adapt poorly to local \nconditions. As a result, standing crops are prone to high summer temperature, unstable water \n                                                 \n1  The project design is summarized in a Project Framework presented in Appendix 1. \n2  Ministry of Macroeconomic and Statistics, 1994\u20132000. Per capita consumption of other cereals such as corn, \nbarley, and oats is negligible. Potatoes are the second largest source of carbohydrate after wheat. \n3  Uzbekistan imports about 100,000 tons of hard durum wheat per annum, which cannot be produced domestically in \nadequate quantity. ", "2 \nsupply, drought, diseases, and pests (e.g., locusts). Second, production costs are still relatively \nhigh due to inefficient farm input use, excessive land preparation, and untimely application of \nfertilizers. Third, wheat seed production has been overly concentrated in the eastern part of the \ncountry (Andijan province), resulting in expensive seed transport, mixing of varieties, and poor \nseed adaptability to other agroclimatic zones. Poor seed germination leads to costly re-sowing \nthat increases farm costs by an average of 16%. Fourth, intensive cultivation of wheat in rain-\nfed areas and wheat and cotton crop rotation in irrigated areas are harming soil fertility and \nstructure. Fifth, the agriculture sector suffers from chronic shortages of fertilizers and machinery \nservices due to low farm profits and inefficient delivery of farm inputs. State-owned enterprises \nstill  play  a dominant  role  in  the supply  of  agrochemicals,  seeds,  machinery  services,  and \npreproduction financing. In an environment of predetermined market shares and prices, the \nenterprises have limited incentives to upgrade or expand services. The use of poorly adapted \nwheat varieties and imbalanced application of fertilizers have lowered the quality of domestically \nproduced wheat flour, yielding bread with low protein content. \n \n6.  National wheat output has also increased largely due to the state order system, which \nhas regulated cropping patterns (land allocation for various crops) and the volumes of wheat \nand cotton farmers must sell to the state, known as the state procurement quotas.4 Although the \nsystem  has  helped  stabilize  crop  outputs,  it  has  limited  farmers\u2019  options  to  adjust  crop \nproduction in response to market conditions and to improve income. The national program for \nwheat self-sufficiency requires the allocation of an estimated 0.8 million ha (25%) of well-\nirrigated land for intensive wheat production, thus, foregoing the land\u2019s full economic potential \nfor growing higher-value crops such as cotton, vegetables, fruits, and seeds (including wheat \nseeds). A comparative crop return analysis is provided in para. 52. Overall, impediments to \nimproving farm incomes have hampered farmers\u2019 ability to reinvest their earnings to increase \nfarm productivity.   \n \n2.  Sector Policies and Programs \n7.  The  agricultural  development  strategy  of  Uzbekistan  is  guided  by  the  Program  for \nStrengthening Reforms in Agriculture of March 1998. Reflecting major sector concerns, the \nprogram pursued three goals: (i) generate robust foreign exchange earnings, mainly through the \nsale of cotton; (ii) improve food security; and (iii) promote rural employment, enhance living \nstandards, and ensure social stability.  \n \n8.  To  stimulate  improvement  in  farm  income  and  productivity,  the  Government  has \nintroduced phased reforms in crop production and marketing. In connection with implementation \nof the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project (AADP),5 beginning in 2002 the Government \nabolished the production targets for wheat and cotton in the pilot district of Ak Altin and lowered \ntheir procurement quotas by more than 50% (Appendix 2). As of 2003, similar reforms are being \nadopted in 5 other pilot districts covered under the World Bank\u2019s Rural Enterprise Support \nProject  (RESP).6  Nationally,  the  Government  has  also  abolished  the  system  of  joint \nresponsibility among farms or family groups to fulfill the procurement quotas.7 Since 1999, the \n                                                 \n4  Regulation of cropping pattern was abolished in March 2003 (para. 9). The obligatory state procurement quotas, \nhowever, remain, although they are being lowered in selected areas.  \n5   ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project. Manila. \nAk Altin is in the Syrdarya province (oblast). \n6  RESP was approved on 28 November 2001, for $36.14 million. \n7  Joint responsibility refers to the system where the failure of a production unit (private farmer or family group) to \nmeet its procurement quota results in an increase in quotas of other units.  ", "  3\n   \nstate has progressively dissolved less productive large cooperative farms or shirkats (Glossary) \ninto private farms, which has increased farm incomes.8 In line with agreements with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF),9 starting \nfrom 2002 the procurement prices for cotton and wheat nationwide are aligned with international \nmarket prices, instead of the state-estimated production costs, as practiced in the past. The \nprice  adjustment  led  to  a  72%  and  57%  rise  in  wheat  and  cotton  procurement  prices, \nrespectively, in 2002\u20132003.10 \n \n9.  In line with IMF conditions and the intention to ease the state monopoly in cotton \nmarketing, the Government adopted a resolution in December 2002 to allow private sector \nparticipation in cotton wholesale and export. Issuance of the resolution was followed by the \nrelease of the Presidential Decree on Deepening Reforms in the Agricultural Sector in March \n2003. The decree directed the Government to accelerate the formation of private farms and \nextend the reforms advocated by ADB and World Bank to abolish cropping pattern restrictions \nnationwide.  To  improve  farm  receipts,  a  price  premium  has  been  introduced  for  state \nprocurement of cotton and cotton byproducts. \n \n10.  As a part of its food security strategy, Uzbekistan aims to stabilize wheat production and \nprices.  With  outputs  exceeding  domestic  consumption  in  2002,  the  Government  has \nimplemented a buffer stock management system to stabilize wheat price. The State also intends \nto lessen the aggregate state procurement of wheat in the coming years below the present level \nof 2.7 million tons. The abolition of prescribed cropping patterns nationwide (para. 9) is intended \nto allow wheat production to adjust more readily to market demand. \n  \n11.  ADB\u2019s operations in Uzbekistan is guided by the Country Operational Strategy (COS) for \nUzbekistan of March 2000 and the Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU) for 2003\u2013\n2005, which both support the Government\u2019s efforts to transform the country\u2019s centrally planned \nsystem  into  a  market  economy  to  promote  economic  efficiency,  generate  sustainable \nemployment, and reduce poverty. The COS emphasizes assistance to agriculture, infrastructure \nrehabilitation, and education. The CSPU particularly emphasizes assistance to agricultural and \nrural development as most of the poor reside in rural areas. \n3.  Project Rationale \n12.  To address the sector challenges and meet the sector goals (paras. 5\u20137), Uzbekistan \nshould  rationalize  its  wheat  production,  particularly  by  minimizing  wheat  cultivation  where \nhigher-value crops can be grown. Investments should be made to stabilize and increase wheat \nyields, especially in the less irrigable and rain-fed lands. Farm access to agrochemicals and \nmachinery must likewise be improved to raise the quality of domestically produced wheat. A \nrelatively low-cost project should be carried out to (i) accelerate the introduction of wheat \nvarieties adaptable to local conditions; (ii) support agricultural extension to promote sustainable \nand  more  profitable  agricultural  practices  and  cropping  rotations  involving  wheat;  and  (iii) \nimprove  farm  access  to  support  services,  including  the  supply  of  agrochemicals,  farm \nmachinery, transport, and agroprocessing services, by promoting private sector participation in \nthese activities. To encourage investment in the farms and rural enterprises, the Project should \n                                                 \n8  Based on government and World Bank surveys. \n9  Agreements with the IMF were in connection with the Staff Monitored Program implemented in January\u2013August \n2002. \n10 The assessment of reform progress is based on findings of the sector review missions fielded in October 2002 and \nApril 2003. ", "4 \nhelp deepen agriculture sector reforms and demonstrate, in selected areas, economically viable \nand sustainable systems of wheat production. \n \n4.  Project Area \n13.  The Project will provide assistance to 5 wheat-producing provinces (oblasts), covering \nwheat breeding, testing of new wheat varieties, dissemination of improved farming technologies, \nand strengthening of the state\u2019s pest-monitoring program. These oblasts were chosen based on \navailability of land suitable for wheat cultivation (i.e., rain-fed areas with precipitation in excess \nof 300 millimeters per annum and irrigable land not suitable for high-value crops). The project \narea stretches from north to south in the central part of the country, covering the oblasts of \nTashkent, Syrdarya, Djizak, Samarkand, and Kashkadarya. The area has 560,000 ha and \n293,000 ha of irrigated and rain-fed wheat area, respectively, or 54% and 95% of the national \ntotals. Average yield of irrigated wheat in the oblasts is 2.4 tons (t)/ha, which is still lower than \nthe national average of 3.8 t/ha. Average rain-fed yields, which range from 0.6 to 1.0 t/ha can \nrealistically be doubled over the coming decade by introducing drought-resistant and earlier-\nmaturing varieties.  \n \n14.  The project oblasts account for 26% of the total agricultural land and 44% of irrigated \nland. They produced 1.5 million tons of wheat (37% of the national total) and 1.0 million tons of \nraw cotton (33% of the total) in 2000. The project area population was 8.9 million (36% of the \ntotal) as of 2001, 6.2 million or 69% of whom live in rural areas, which is higher than the national \nfigure of 63%. Of the total cultivated area of 1.9 million ha, 72% were under farm enterprises \n(state or shirkat farms), 18% under private farms, and 10% under dehkan farms (Glossary). In \n2001 almost all farm enterprises and private farms planted wheat, occupying 42% and 40% of \ntheir total sown areas, respectively. At least 70% of rural families in Kaskadarya, Samarkand, \nand Djizak, and 40% in Tashkent and Syrdarya planted wheat in their backyard plots (average \n0.15 ha per household).  \n \n15.  Intensive and integrated assistance will be provided in three focus districts within the \nproject oblasts. These will cover assistance provided to the oblasts as well as additional support \nfor operations of private seed companies, enterprises providing farm support services, and \nfarmer-owned advisory extension centers. The districts are selected based on their (i) climate \nand soil suitability to support rain-fed wheat (commercial grain and seed production), (ii) soil \nsuitability for irrigated wheat production, (iii) reliability of the irrigation system and availability of \nwell-irrigated and drained land for wheat seed production, and (iv) distance and access to \nmarket as a proxy for attractiveness of the district to private sector investment. Criteria and \nmechanisms  used  to  select  focus  districts,  and  the  description  of  the  project  area  are  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  B.  The  three  districts  are:  Zamin  (286,000  ha)  in  Djizak  oblast, \nKatakurgan (146,778 ha) in Samarkand oblast, and Kuyi Chirchik (56,000 ha) in Tashkent \noblast. Zamin and Katakurgan have been selected as model sites for rain-fed and irrigated \nwheat seed and commercial grain farming. Kuyi-Chirchick was chosen as a potential regional \ncenter of seed production for Tashkent and Syrdarya oblasts.    \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n16.  The  project  objective  is  to  promote  economical  and  sustainable  systems  of  wheat \nproduction. Achievement of the project objective will contribute to the realization of the project \ngoal to improve farm income. ", "  5\n   \n  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n17.  The Project has the following components: (i) varietal development  and testing, (ii) \nenhanced  farm  management,  (iii)  agricultural  enterprise  development,  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement. They are described below. \n \n1.  Varietal Development and Testing \na.  Varietal Development \n18.  The component will strengthen the capacity of the Andijan and Galla-Aral Cereals and \nLegumes Research Institute (AGCLRI) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources \n(MAWR)  to  efficiently  evaluate  and  identify,  among  hundreds  of  local  and  foreign  wheat \nvarieties  and  parent  materials,  varieties  suitable  for  the  local  growing  conditions.  Project \ninterventions will complement assistance already received by the institute in forms of breeding \nmaterials and training, with the provision of laboratory and field equipment; refurbishment of \nlaboratories, greenhouses, and storage facilities; establishment of research plots; supply of \nwork  materials;  and  domestic/overseas  staff  training.  The  assistance  to  AGCLRI  will  be \naccompanied by capacity building of the Plant Genetics Institute (PGI) of the MAWR to upgrade \nits capability to evaluate cereal resistance to diseases. Aside from support for wheat varietal \ndevelopment, the Project will also assist the legume variety development by AGCLRI to help \npromote wheat and legume crop rotation, particularly in the rain-fed areas. \n \n19.  The outputs expected from the subcomponent are the release of at least 6 new wheat \nvarieties that are well-suited to local conditions, and the doubling of the AGCLRI capacity to \nmultiply foundation seeds from 400 tons to 900 tons per annum. Desirable characteristics of \nnew wheat varieties include improved baking quality, early maturity and improved tolerance to \ndrought  for  rain-fed  varieties,  resistance  to  local  pests  and  diseases,11  reduced  grain  loss \nthrough shattering at maturity, and variable grain maturity period for irrigated wheat to lengthen \nthe  harvest  season  and  reduce  the  number  of  expensive  combine  harvesters  required  by \nfarmers. The Project will also support commercial production of improved seeds through the \nestablishment and capacity building of private seed companies in the project districts (para. 25). \n \nb.  Varietal Testing \n20.  Capacity building assistance will be provided under the Project to the State Commission \non Varietal Testing (SCVT), a regulatory agency of MAWR, to strengthen and expedite the \nagency\u2019s evaluation of promising varieties identified by AGCLRI and varieties to be imported \ninto Uzbekistan by private seed companies. Aside from building the capacity of 5 SCVT test \nstations in the 5 project oblasts, the Project will expand the geographical coverage of varietal \ntesting to include 15 on-farm sites to ensure robust evaluation of varieties under different agro-\necological conditions. Under the component, consultant inputs will be provided to (i) upgrade \nSCVT\u2019s testing procedures, (ii) upgrade quality control in the seed multiplication, (iii) develop a \nplan for AGCLRI and SCVT to better recover the costs of varietal development, and (iv) promote \nfarmers\u2019 participation in the wheat breeding program.  \n \n                                                 \n11 Breeding for resistance to fungal leaf diseases such as rust is a continuing process as rust organisms naturally \nmutate. ", "6 \n2.  Enhanced Farm Management \na.  Farm Extension \n21.  In the three focus districts, the Project will support operations of three rural business \nadvisory centers (RBACs) established under the Association of Dehkan and Private Farmers \n(ADPF), which is a national farmers association. The RBACs will function as rural consulting \nfirms, particularly to provide private and household farms with technical farming, legal, and \nfinancial  advisory  services.  Their  services  will  include  the  preparation  of  market  demand \nanalysis and feasibility studies for farms and enterprises. Based on feedback from farmers\u2019-\nneed  surveys,  RBACs  will  introduce  new  crop  varieties  and  organize  demonstrations  of \nalternative crop rotation regimes and farm management practices. With funds appropriated to \nthem, RBACs will contract appropriate institutes and experts to facilitate on-farm demonstration \nand disseminate technologies that interest farmers. Experienced farmers from other regions will \nalso be invited to exchange views and experiences with farmers in the project districts. The \nsubcomponent will therefore promote consultative and demand-oriented rural extension service.  \n \nb.  Technology Development \n22.  To  introduce  new  and  appropriate  technologies,  selected  institutes  of  MAWR  will \norganize  field  demonstrations  and  prepare  manuals  for  farmers.  Priority  will  be  given  to \ntechnologies that have been pilot-tested in Uzbekistan and proven promising technically and \nfinancially\u2014particularly those tested under ADB-funded regional technical assistance for On-\nfarm Soil and Water Management in Central Asia.12 For water-short and rain-fed areas, the \nProject  will  promote  adoption  of  low-tillage  techniques  to  conserve  soil  moisture,  lessen \nmachinery costs, and allow early planting and maturity of wheat. Early maturity in these areas \nwill reduce yield losses due to exposure of crops to the high summer temperature. Other \ntechniques  for  water-short  areas  are  alternate  year  planting  and  wheat-legume  rotation  to \nimprove soil fertility and moisture retention. In irrigated lands, the subcomponent will promote \ncut-back and alternate furrow irrigation methods as well as furrow-bed planting techniques to \nreduce excessive water application and mitigate the adverse effect of soil salinity. Improved soil \nand water management techniques will be introduced by the Central Asian Institute for Irrigation \nResearch (CAIIR) in association with other institutes selected by the project working group. For \nfields that produce wheat seeds, laser field leveling will be tested to ensure a high rate of \ngermination of expensive foundation and elite seeds, and uniform water application to allow \nsubstantial  increase  in  yields.  Laser  land  leveling  technology  will  be  introduced  by  the \nAgricultural Institute for Mechanization and Electrification (AIME). \n \n23.  The  capacity  of  the  Plant  Protection  Institute  (PPI)  will  be  improved  under  the \nsubcomponent to monitor and forecast disease, pest and weed infestations, particularly locust \ninfestation, which has harmed wheat crops. The Project will provide equipment and support field \nmonitoring works to help MAWR recommend in a timely manner measures needed to prevent \ncostly pest and disease outbreaks. Support for PPI and MAWR will include financing information \ndissemination to farmers on the risks of pest infestation and implementation of critically needed \npest control interventions to prevent pest outbreaks. \n \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1999. Regional Technical Assistance for the Fourth Agriculture and Natural Resource Research at CGIAR \nCenters. Manila. Pertinent activities are carried out under the component for On-Farm Soil and Water Management \nfor Sustainable Agriculture in Central Asia, for $1.2 million.  ", "  7\n   \nc.  Irrigation Facility Repair \n24.  The Project will help improve irrigation and drainage facilities on about 6,000 ha of wheat \nseed-producing  farms  to  help  ensure  robust  seed  production  in  the  focus  districts. \nComplementing the on-farm rehabilitation works, minor repairs will be performed on the existing \ninter-farm water conveyance and collector drainage facilities. Field surveys and civil works for \nthe subcomponent will be funded with government counterpart resources. The rehabilitation \nplan, and costs for each farm will be agreed between farmers and the district agriculture and \nwater resources department (DAWD) of MAWR and the project management office (PMO). The \ncost of facility repairs will be recovered in 25 years (para. 56).13 To sustain the operation of the \nrehabilitated irrigation facilities, the Project will support the formation and operations of water \nusers  associations  (WUAs).  The  Project  will  also  provide  critically  needed  equipment  to \nmaintain primary canals and drainage collectors in the project districts to be undertaken by \nDAWDs. \n \n3.  Agricultural Enterprise Development \n25.  The shortage of machinery and agrochemicals are key causes for unstable crop yields \nand deteriorating quality of domestically produced wheat. In the project districts, the component \nwill  help  form  and  operate  privately  owned  agricultural  service  centers  (ASCs),  which  will \nprovide  farmers  with  diversified  services  such  as  machinery  rental,  input  retailing, \nagroprocessing, marketing, and transportation. The Project will also help create and assist the \noperation of private companies that will produce high-quality wheat seeds in the three districts. \nThe seed companies will work together with private farms, on a contractual basis, to cultivate \nand multiply seeds from foundation seeds.  \n \n26.  The project loan funds of $10.1 million will be provided to enterprises under the Project \nthrough selected participating financial institutions (PFIs). The enterprises will use the project \nsubloans to procure needed equipment and other capital investment requirements. Details of \nthe eligibility criteria of PFIs and subborrowers and the on-lending arrangements are in Appendix \n3. The Project will screen suitable private sector sponsors, including groups of private farmers, \nlocal businesses, and foreign joint ventures, and assist the operations of the ASCs and seed \ncompanies. The technical assistance for furthering reforms in the grain sector (paras. 49\u201350) \nwill also assist prospective sponsors to refine their business plans and provide technical and \nlegal assistance necessary for their business operations. To promote the development of ASCs \nand seed companies and ensure the affordability of goods and services they provide, key \nreform initiatives will be introduced in the project districts, primarily to ease the state control of \nprices  and  obligatory  procurement  quotas  for  wheat  and  wheat  seeds  and  to  promote \ncompetition among the enterprises (paras. 29, 69, and 70). \n \n27.  Suitable  PFIs,  such  as  Pahta  and  Asaka  Banks,  were  identified  during  project \npreparation in 2003. However, given the potential consolidation and privatization of the banks in \nanticipation of the full convertibility of the Sum, selection of PFIs to take part in the Project will \nbe carried out in 2004. This approach will prevent the need to repeat the PFI selection and will \nnot hinder project implementation. International and local banking experts (3 person-months) \nwill be engaged to facilitate the selection process.  \n \n \n                                                 \n13 Repayment scheme for the on-farm works will follow a similar scheme being introduced under AADP. ", "8 \n4.  Project Management \n28.    The Project will help operate the PMO and three project site offices (PSOs) in the \nproject districts. The PMO will be provided with qualified staff, equipment, vehicles, and facilities \nnecessary  to  coordinate  and  supervise  project  activities,  and  will  be  headed  by  a  project \nmanager, who will report to a director general of the Rural Restructuring Agency (RRA), the \nproject executing agency. The director general will be the project director. PMO and PSO \nactivities will focus on administrative and financial management tasks. Technical tasks will be \ncarried out by the line departments and institutes under MAWR with administrative and resource \nallocation support from the PMO to strengthen the capacity of MAWR to perform its duties. PMO \nand PSO operations will be supported by project management consultants, who will provide on-\nthe-job training in project administration, monitoring, and evaluation. PMO and PSO staff will \nalso receive training in activity planning, budgeting, procurement procedures, and preparation of \nproject reports. \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Support for Agricultural Sector Reforms \n29.  The Project will help introduce market-oriented reforms in the agriculture sector. In the \nthree project districts, state procurement quotas for wheat\u2014a parameter that reflects the state\u2019s \ndirect involvement in farm production and marketing decisions\u2014will be reduced from over 50% \nto  25%  of  historical  output,  in  line  with  reforms  introduced  under  AADP  and  RESP.  The \nGovernment has further agreed to lower the procurement quotas for wheat seeds in the project \ndistricts as outlined in para. 69. Given the state\u2019s dominant role in wheat seed production and \nfarm input retailing, the reforms will be introduced to reduce the state\u2019s direct involvement and \npromote private sector participation in these business activities. The Project will facilitate the \nestablishment and operation of fully private ASCs and seed companies. This initiative will be a \nstep forward in the sector\u2019s transition process following the creation of a commercially-run state-\nowned farm equipment rental firm under AADP, and joint venture ASCs between the state and \nprivate sector under RESP.14  \n \n2.  Demand-Oriented Agricultural Extension \n30.  The concentration of project resources on RBACs, instead of a higher-level apparatus, is \nintended to decentralize agricultural extension program of MAWR so that RBACs will be more \nresponsive to the needs of farmers and local communities. The project design to gradually \nchange the RBACs\u2019 source of funding from state and project budgets to the collection of service \nfees will also give appropriate incentives for RBACs to better understand their clients\u2019 needs \nand meet them in a cost effective manner. The initiative, therefore, will help institutionalize \nfarmers\u2019 feedback mechanisms and participation on extension services provided under the \nProject. At national level, the Project will also help simplify information pamphlets and manuals \nto  enhance  the  dissemination  of  technical,  legal,  and  market  information  in  rural  areas. \nImproved information materials will be distributed by RBACs and DAWDs on a cost recovery \nbasis. \n   \n                                                 \n14 Under RESP, the state may hold up to 40% equity stake in ASCs. ", "  9\n   \nD.  Cost Estimates \n31.  The total project cost is estimated at $40.0 million equivalent, comprising $23.4 million in \nforeign exchange costs and $16.6 million equivalent in local currency costs. The estimates \ninclude provision for $2.3 million in taxes and duties, and $3.8 million in the physical and price \ncontingencies.

Financing Plan  \n32.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  has  requested  a  loan  of  $26.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of \n0.50% of the loan amount (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government of Uzbekistan has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facilities \non the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n  \n33.  The proposed loan will finance 65% of the total project cost. The loan will cover the \nentire foreign exchange cost of $23.4 million and $2.6 million equivalent in local currency cost. \nThe  beneficiaries  and  private  sector  will  contribute  about  $3.4  million  for  preparation  of \ndemonstration  plots,  maintenance  of  the  RBAC  facilities,  and  counterpart  investment  and \nworking capital for ASCs and seed enterprises. The Government will provide the remaining \n$10.6 million equivalent. For agricultural enterprise development, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nwill enter into subsidiary loan agreements for $10.1 million on behalf of the Borrower and two ", "10 \nPFIs for on-lending to ASCs and seed enterprises.15 A summary of the proposed financing plan \nis in Table 2.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n34.  A project steering committee (PSC) will be formed to provide policy guidance to RRA in \nimplementing the Project and to review the Project\u2019s reform and development impacts. The PSC \nwill be headed by a deputy prime minister and comprise senior staff of the Cabinet of Ministers \n(COM), MAWR, Ministry of Economy (MOE), MOF, and other concerned agencies. To facilitate \ntechnical coordination and project resource allocation among agencies involved in the Project, a \nproject working group (PWG) will  be formed, chaired by MAWR. The group will comprise \ntechnical staff of MAWR, RRA,  COM,  MOE,  MOF, State Committee for Nature Protection \n(SCNP), State Committee for Land Resources (SCLR), State Center for Seed Quality Control \nand  Certification,  concerned  agencies,  and  representatives  of  local  governments,  ADPF, \nfarmers\u2019 organizations, and PFIs. The PSC and PWG will be formed before loan effectiveness. \nProject implementation and fund flow charts are in Appendix 5. \n \n35.  As the executing agency, RRA will be responsible for the overall project management \nand coordination. A PMO will be established within RRA and 3 PSOs will coordinate and \nmonitor activities in the project districts.  \n \n36.  AGCLRI and the Plant Pathology Department of PGI will implement the wheat varietal \ndevelopment subcomponent. They will be accountable to the PWG for the accomplishment of \nproject targets and resources used. SCVT will build the capacity of MAWR to regulate crop \nvarietal development. SCVT performance will be monitored by PWG through the Office of the \nMinister of Agriculture and Water Resources. \n \n37.  Extension services in the project districts will be carried out by RBACs. Activities and \nperformance of RBACs will be evaluated by ADPF, which, in turn, will be accountable to the \nPWG.  The  CAIIR,  AIME,  and  PPI  will  implement  the  subcomponent  for  technological \ndevelopment and pest monitoring. These institutes will be accountable to the PWG through \nMAWR\u2019s  Scientific  Production  Center  for  Agriculture.  The  subcomponent  for  irrigation  and \ndrainage system repair will be implemented by MAWR\u2019s Water Resources Department, and \nRBACs will support operations of the WUAs. In coordination with RRA and MOF, PFIs will \nimplement the component for agricultural enterprise development.  \n \n                                                 \n15 The terms of subsidiary loan agreement will not be softer than those of the ADB\u2019s loan to the Government. ", "  11\n   \n2.  Procurement \n38.  Farm  machinery,  field  and  laboratory  equipment,  minor  civil  works,  vehicles,  office \nequipment, and materials required for project implementation and monitoring will be procured \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment and material procurement contracts \nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  or  more  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts costing less than $500,000 will be awarded on \nthe basis of international shopping procedures acceptable to ADB. Small supply contracts and \ntraining activities costing less than $100,000 will be procured through direct purchase. The \naward of all equipment contracts will be subject to approval by ADB. \n \n39.  Each civil works contract estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,000,000 or more will be \nawarded on the basis of ICB procedures as described in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nCivil works contracts costing less than $1,000,000 will be carried out on the basis of local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. An indicative list of procurement packages \nis in Appendix 6. \n  \n40.  For procurement of goods and services financed by subloans made out of the proceeds \nof the loan, subborrowers will need to demonstrate that the procurement procedures adopted \nare  transparent,  efficient,  and  conform  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and \nAnticorruption Policy. PFIs will certify to ADB that the goods and services financed by the \nsubloans are procured from ADB member countries. Where the value of goods financed by a \nsubloan  exceeds  $1 million,  a preshipment inspection  certificate  from  a  reputable  agency, \nacceptable to ADB, will be required. \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n41.  The Project will provide for 31 person-months of international and 42 person-months of \ndomestic consultants. The international consultants will help administer the project, monitor and \nevaluate project impacts, upgrade wheat breeding and varietal selection, develop effective \nextension services, and evaluate the suitability of PFIs to take part in the Project.  Domestic \nconsultants will help organize WUAs to improve the operation and maintenance of irrigation \nfacilities; and help build RBAC capacity in extension service delivery, project impact evaluation, \nand PFI evaluation. Banking experts will be engaged through individual contracts to evaluate \nthe PFIs. Other consultants will be provided by an international consulting firm in association \nwith a domestic consulting firm to be engaged by RRA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of the \ndomestic consultants. An outline of the terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 7. \n \n4.  Advance Procurement Action \n42.  To  expedite  project  implementation,  vehicles,  field  and  laboratory  equipment,  and \nconsultant services may be procured in advance. The Government has been informed that (i) \nadvance action will cover actions up to, but not including, contract signing; and (ii) approval of \nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project.   \n \n5.  Accounts \n43.  After loan effectiveness, an imprest account will be established at the Central Bank of \nUzbekistan or a commercial bank acceptable to ADB to facilitate the timely release of loan \nfunds.  Thereafter,  once  the  PMO  has  established  an  adequate  accounting  system  for  the ", "12 \nProject, the ceiling for the imprest account will be based on estimated expenditures in six \nmonths. The use of ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures will be considered in the first \nyear of project implementation, assuming the establishment of RRA\u2019s separate accounting \nsystem and internal control procedures for the Project. For the subloans provided through PFIs, \nRRA  and  PFIs  will  collect  supporting  documents  and  prepare  withdrawal  applications  and \nfurnish them to ADB. The establishment of the imprest account and disbursement of subloans \nunder the Project will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and other \nprocedures agreed upon by ADB and the Government.   \n \n6.  Audit \n44.  RRA will keep separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which will be \naudited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Loan proceeds will be used to \nengage auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will be \nsubmitted to ADB within six months after the end of the fiscal year. ASCs and seed companies \nreceiving subloans under the Project will also be required to provide audited financial reports \nacceptable to MOF, PFIs, and ADB. \n \n7.  Reports \n45.  RRA, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB, indicating \nprogress  made  and  problems  encountered,  steps  taken  to  remedy  them,  and  a  proposed \nprogram of activities and outputs for the next reporting period. RRA will also provide other \nreports and information relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request, including the \nProject\u2019s environmental impacts, dialogue with beneficiaries, and social issues relating to the \nProject. Within three months after the physical completion of the Project, RRA will submit to \nADB  a  project  completion  report  detailing,  among  other  things,  information  on  project \nimplementation, use of project funds, and the extent to which project objectives have been \naccomplished.  \n \n8.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n46.  To monitor the Project\u2019s economic, social, and environmental impacts, a monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E) unit will be formed within the PMO. The unit will have two full-time staff with \nexpertise in economics and environmental monitoring, and will (i) monitor the delivery of project \nbenefits  to  targeted  recipients;  and  (ii)  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental impacts. With assistance of the M&E consultants, and in cooperation with the \nlocal governments, the unit will develop a project M&E system for key project performance \nindicators such as household welfare (farm receipts, household incomes, household access to \nfood) and efficacy of policy reforms in liberalizing farm-level decision making, enhancing crop \nprices, and increasing state revenues. M&E should also evaluate the impacts of subloans \nprovided  to  ASCs  and  seed  enterprises.  Participation  of  women  in  the  project-sponsored \nresearch, training, and farm extension will also be monitored. A socioeconomic profile of the \nbeneficiaries will be prepared at the start of project implementation. The profile will be updated \nat project completion, and a report will describe the project benefits and impacts. \n \n47.  Environmental monitoring will include analysis of soil and water samples in the project \ndistricts to assess the impacts of increased application of agrochemicals and salt leaching. Field \ninspection will also be strengthened to ensure that expansion of rain-fed wheat farms will not \nencroach on grassland and marginal desert zones (para. 64). \n ", "  13\n   \n9.  Midterm Review \n48.  The Government and ADB will jointly carry out a midterm review at the end of the third \nyear of project implementation. The review will assess, among others, (i) project implementation \nprogress;  (ii)  performance  of  project  stakeholders,  consultants,  and  contractors;  and  (iii) \ncompliance with assurances stipulated in the Loan Agreement. Project impacts will also be \nassessed covering aspects outlined in paras. 46\u201347. \n. \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n49.  An associated grant-financed TA will be provided to complement the Project. The TA will \nsupport reforms in agriculture, particularly in the wheat subsector. TA activities will be grouped \ninto two components: (i) facilitating private sector entry into seed production and operation of \nASCs in the focus districts, and (ii) supporting the government review of wheat production and \nmarketing  policies  (Appendix  8).  The  first  component  will  help  potential  investors  in  seed \ncompanies and ASCs (i) better formulate their business visions and strategies, and (ii) secure \ncommercial financing for the companies\u2019 operations. The component will also help (i) build an \nunderstanding in the central and local governments of how the private sector can help develop \nthe agriculture sector, (ii) identify reforms to facilitate private sector participation in the sector, \n(iii) build the capacity of RBACs to deliver business advisory services to private entrepreneurs \nand  farmers,  and  (iv) ASCs  and  seed  enterprises  develop  growing  contract  schemes  and \nextend preproduction credit to farmers. The second TA component will help MAWR, MOF, and \nMOE identify market mechanism by which grain prices and output can be stabilized and food \nsecurity achieved in a cost-effective manner. Viable options include the introduction of buffer \ngrain stock management, price and tax incentive schemes, and flexible trade policies. \n   \n50.  The total TA cost is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe TA will provide for 12 person-months of international and 15 person-months of domestic \nconsultants. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other procedures acceptable to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. The TA will commence in the first year of project implementation and be \ncompleted in 10 months. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses \n51.  Financial and economic analyses have been carried out to assess the attractiveness of \nwheat cultivation and the sustainability of project investments under current and future\u2014more \nliberalized\u2014market  environments.  The  current  (financial)  price  regime  assumed  the \nimplementation of existing policies as of 2003. This scenario assumed the alignment of state \nprocurement prices for wheat and cotton to international prices and abolition of state control of \nthe cropping patterns (para. 9). The financial analysis also assumed the adoption of reduced \nprocurement quotas for wheat and wheat seeds as outlined in the project assurances (para. 69). \nFor the crop budget analysis, as of October 2002 the state procurement prices for wheat and \ncotton were estimated at 30% and 52% below their economic parity prices, respectively, while \ntraded agrochemicals are 27-35% below their economic prices. The divergence between the \nfinancial and economic prices has been attributed mainly to the divergence of the official and ", "14 \nmarket exchange rates. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.3 was used.16 In accordance with \nmarket standards, wheat seed prices are calculated at 50\u2013200% over the commercial grain \nprices, depending on genetic purity. Market prices for wheat, for above-quota sales by farmers, \nwere estimated at 20% over the state procurement prices based on data for 2001\u20132002. A \nliberalized policy environment assumes the convergence of financial prices toward economic \nprices and termination of the procurement quota system.  \n \n1.  Comparative Analysis of Wheat Production \n52.  Financial and economic gross profits of 11 crops grown in Central Asia, including wheat, \nhave been estimated to assess the attractiveness of wheat cultivation under the current and \nliberalized policy environment. Crop budget models were developed to assess crop profitability \nin  three  growing  areas:  well-irrigated,  irrigation-deficit  (Glossary),  and  rain-fed  areas.  The \nassessment showed that wheat, on average, generates positive farm incomes in the three \ngrowing areas  (Appendix 9, Table A9.1). In the irrigation-deficit area, wheat provides the \nhighest financial and economic returns among the crops evaluated. In the rain-fed system, \ncrops with limited demand, such as chickpeas and sesame provide higher return than wheat. \nDue to their drought tolerance, chickpeas and safflower can be grown in rotation with wheat to \nmaximize and stabilize farm incomes. On well-irrigated land, wheat generates less income than \ncotton; vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, and onions); wheat seed; and fodder crops. Depending \non farmers\u2019 preference, irrigated wheat can be grown in rotation with cotton to stabilize farm \nincomes. However, this rotation cannot be sustained for many years as it will result in the \ndeterioration of soil and yields of both crops. Overall the assessment concluded that wheat is a \nfinancially and economically attractive crop, particularly for the irrigation-deficit and rain-fed \nareas.17 On well-irrigated land farmers may choose to grow wheat for food security and income \nstabilization.  \n   \n2.  Financial Analysis \n53.  Financial analyses have been conducted for farms, ASCs, and seed companies.  For \nrepresentative farms, projected income is expected to increase over the next decade. For \nrepresentative rain-fed farms, annual income is projected to rise from SUM18,950 ($19) per ha \nto SUM48,840 ($50) as a result of project interventions (Appendix 9). Incomes from irrigated \nfarms were estimated to rise from SUM100,300 ($102) per ha to SUM350,700 ($360). For \nirrigated farms producing wheat seed, returns are expected to rise from SUM150,000 ($154) per \nha to SUM357,000 ($365) in year 10. \n \n54.  Financial analysis of ASCs was carried out over 25 years for the discounted cash flow \nanalysis, and 15 years for financial projections. Based on models of existing operations, the \nproject ASCs are expected to carry out diversified lines of business including farm machinery \nhire and repair services, flour milling, and cotton/safflower oil extraction. The analysis found that \nthe projected financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for ASC is 27.5%. Estimated performance \nand creditworthiness ratios are satisfactory, with the earnings-to-sales ratio rising from 17% to \n34%  over  15  years,  and  debt-to-equity  ratio  falling  from  3.3  to  1.6  in  four  years.    ASC \nperformance is sensitive to rising fixed and variable costs and to the level of annual turnover. \nShortfalls in turnover as a result of poor management, excessive machinery downtime, or \nproblems with service marketing, will erode projected profits (Appendix 9, Tables A9.2\u2013A9.3.) \n                                                 \n16 The price divergence on cotton is higher due to additional taxes on cotton ginning (processing). \n17 Estimated size of irrigation deficit areas in each oblast is in Supplementary Appendix B. ", "  15\n   \nThe financial analysis of the representative seed companies also confirmed the financial viability \nof investment in seed processing, with an estimated FIRR of 34.3% over 15 years. \n \n3.  Economic Analysis \n55.  The economic analysis was carried out using the domestic price numeraire method, with \nadjustments made to remove taxes and duties and to apply a shadow exchange rate factor of \n1.3  to  the  border  prices  of  traded  goods.  In  view  of  substantial  unemployment  and \nunderemployment in the rural sector, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.8 was also applied. \nQuantification  of  incremental  benefits  arising  from  the  project  interventions  was  limited  to \nbenefits  resulting  from  improved  wheat  yields.  This  approach  excluded  project  benefits \nexpected from the shift of the cropping pattern in well-irrigated lands from wheat to higher-value \ncrops, made possible by the increase of wheat yields. The analysis also excluded expected \nincrease in profits from crops other than wheat arising from better crop rotation regimes. The \nanalysis therefore relied on conservative benefit estimates. Over a 25-year impact period, the \nProject is expected to yield an economic internal rate of return of 31%. The attractive return is \nattributed to the relatively low project investment costs and high incremental benefits expected \nfrom  the  support  of  agricultural  research  and  adoption  of  technologies  planned  under  the \nProject. A sensitivity analysis also showed the robustness of the projected returns in response \nto variations in the cost-and-benefit streams. Details of the economic analysis are in Appendix \n9. \n \nB.  Cost Recovery \n56.  An estimated 65% of project costs will be recovered through users\u2019 fees and subloan \nrepayment. Seed farms will be required to repay the repair costs of on-farm irrigation/drainage \nfacilities to be agreed on between farmers and MAWR.18 The repayments will be collected \nthrough a 25-year betterment levy, the mechanism of which is being implemented under AADP. \nThe state will shoulder the costs of (i) minor repairs of inter-farm collector drainage, and (ii) \ninstitutional building of WUAs and introduction of irrigation service fees in the three project \ndistricts. ASCs and seed companies, to be established as private commercial entities, will repay \ntheir subloans.   \n \n57.  Because  of  low  farmers\u2019  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  new  technologies  and  the \nundeveloped  legal  framework  for  royalty  collection,  the  costs  of  wheat-breeding  research, \nvariety testing, and initial phase of technology dissemination under the Project will not be \nrecovered through users\u2019 fees but, indirectly, through taxation of the more productive agriculture \nsector.  Similarly,  expenses  to  develop  and  adapt  improved  farming  practices  (laser  land \nleveling, reduced tillage, direct seed drilling, and alternative crop rotation) by AIME and CAIIR, \nand pest monitoring by PPI will not be directly recovered through users\u2019 fees. To help establish \nthe RBACs, the Project will pay for their operating costs in the first two years of their operation.  \n \nC.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n58.  The Project will help improve the standard of living in the project area by reducing \nhousehold vulnerability to food shortages, creating jobs, and improving incomes. An estimated \n217,000 rural people, at least 31% poor, are estimated to directly benefit from the Project. \nPoverty incidence is highest in Kashkadarya, at 63%, or more than twice the national average of \n                                                 \n18 Comprehensive repair is estimated to cost $906 per hectare. Actual cost, however, may be lower depending on \nfarmers\u2019 needs and willingness to pay.  ", "16 \n28%. Djizak also has a poverty incidence slightly higher than national average, at 30%. The \nmore fertile and better irrigated Tashkent and Syrdarya have lower poverty incidence rates at \n17% and 8%, respectively.  \n \n59.  A  participatory  rural  assessment  in  the  project  area  suggested  that  the  most \nimpoverished rural families are those that provide semiskilled and unskilled labor to shirkat and \nprivate farms. These families suffer from a lack of jobs; low wages; delayed wage payment; and \ndeclining availability of rural social services (school, clinics, and water supply) that used to be \nprovided by their shirkats.19 On farms that are less productive and have difficulties meeting their \nwheat procurement quotas, workers are particularly vulnerable as they have little wheat for their \nown consumption or for sale to the local market after their farms meet their  quotas. The \nincidence  of  poverty  is  consequently  higher  where  land  is  less  productive,  such  as  in \nKaskadarya and Djizak. Other vulnerable groups are households with one income earner, no \noff-farm employment skills,20 and those with handicapped and elderly members. Because of \nlimited alternative livelihood options, low-income families are ironically the most dependent on \ntheir household (backyard) plots, which were allocated by local governments. These households \ndevote more than half their income to food. Less impoverished households are those that have \naccess to nonagricultural employment or reside near urban areas, and thus are able to cultivate \nfruits and vegetables for cash income. \n \n60.  Improved wheat production in the project area will benefit farm workers in the private \nand shirkat farms as higher production will result in higher surpluses over and above state \nprocurement quotas. Incremental yield increases of 0.30\u20130.40 t/ha envisaged by 2008 will, \nconservatively, raise calorie supply by 182\u2013505 calories per person per day, or 9\u201324% of the \nfood-based  poverty  threshold  of  2,100  calories  per  person  per  day,  used  as  the  regional \nbenchmark. Envisaged incremental increase in calorie availability per person is greater for the \nrain-fed farms, at 346\u2013505 calories per person per day, compared to the irrigated shirkat farms, \nat 182\u2013386 calories per person per day, suggesting that the poorer farms and households in \nrain-fed and irrigation deficit areas will particularly benefit from the project interventions. \n  \n61.  Some 30\u201370% of rural households in Kashkardya, Samarkand, and Djizak grow wheat \nin their backyard plots to ensure food supply. The urban and rural poor (e.g., retirees and the \nunemployed) not employed by the private and shirkat farms will likewise benefit from the use of \nimproved wheat varieties grown in their dekhan and backyard plots. Because of intensive \nmanagement, wheat yield in backyard plots is on average 60% higher than in shirkats. The main \nproject benefits to backyard farm operators will be wheat that is resistant to pests and diseases, \nand provides better flour quality. Project interventions to improve wheat yields are pro-poor \nbecause poor families derive most of their calorie intake from staple food.  \n \n62.  The Project will also increase seasonal farm employment. In irrigated areas, higher \nwheat yield will allow substitution of wheat for cotton and vegetable, which cultivation is more \nlabor intensive. Improved resistance and enhanced soil fertility management for rain-fed wheat \nwill also stabilize wheat cultivation areas in the less irrigable and rain-fed lands. The Project is \nestimated to generate an additional 42,500 person-months of employment per annum by 2008. \nThe most significant gender impact of the Project will be increased demand for weeding in rain-\n                                                 \n19 Rural residents in the project area have poorer access to basic social services than urban inhabitants, with children \non average having longer (three years) schooling. Access to drinking water, sanitation, and heating gas is likewise \nsubstantially lower in rural areas \n20 Wage rates in the communications sector in 2000, for instance, were 185% of those in agriculture. In real terms an \nagricultural worker on a shirkat farm receives the equivalent of SUM3,500 per month, not accounting for wage \narrears. While workers on private farms do not necessarily receive higher wages, they are usually paid on time. ", "  17\n   \nfed wheat farms and for cotton harvesting in irrigated areas in the spring and summer\u2014tasks \nusually performed by women and young adults. A consultative approach to extension will be \nadopted to ensure that women participate in the project activities such as farm extension and \ndemonstration. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n63.  The Project is expected to improve soil and water quality in the project area. Introduction \nof sustainable crop rotation regimes such as combination of legumes and wheat, balanced \nfertilizer application, and minimum soil tillage techniques will help improve soil structure and \nfertility, and conserve moisture. Improved on-farm drainage will reduce soil salinity. Due to \nfinancial  stringency  in  the  past  decade,  agrochemical  and  machinery  use  have  fallen \nconsiderably. Therefore, potential adverse impacts of having more fertilizer and farm machinery \nare expected to be negligible. The sales of fertilizers and agrochemicals by the project ASCs at \nmarket prices will not likely to result in an overuse of these farm inputs.  \n \n64.  A potential adverse risk may arise from repairing drainage facilities in the seed-growing \nareas in the project districts. To reduce salinity level, soil will be leached with irrigation water \nonce drainage is improved. Leaching could increase salt release to surrounding rivers and water \nbodies. The risk will be mitigated by helping the SCNP monitor the release of drainage water by \nfarmers  and  test  the  on-  and  off-farm  soil  and  water  quality.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental \nassessment also recognized that introducing drought-resistant wheat varieties may result in \nexpanding wheat cultivation to grassland and marginal land in the medium and long term. As \nUzbekistan  has  developed  zone  maps  that  satisfactorily  distinguish  cultivable,  grass,  and \nmarginal lands, the Project will enhance field monitoring of farm expansion. This task will be \nperformed by the State Committee for Land Resources. \n \n65.  The Project is expected to have  a neutral to positive environmental impact on the \ndesertification and salinization of the Aral Sea region.  The Aral Sea, in Western Uzbekistan, is \nfed by the Amudarya and Syrdariya rivers. Decreasing stream flows because of excessive \ndiversion of the river water has resulted in the desiccation of the sea.  Project interventions, in \nthe upstream reaches of the two rivers, such as direct seeding, minimum tillage, alternate furrow \nirrigation, and land leveling, will help reduce water demand. The project interventions, combined \nwith implementation of a sustainable and enforceable water sharing agreement among local \nadministrations and countries in the region, would contribute to substantial reduction of water \ndiversion in the Aral Sea basin. An initial environmental examination report for the Project is in \nSupplementary Appendix H. \n \nE.  Project Risks \n66.  A number of factors may hamper project implementation and sustainability of benefit \nimpacts. Economic and agriculture policies remain deficient, including overvaluation of the local \ncurrency, which has undervalued agricultural commodity prices, subsidized farm inputs, and \nconstrained enterprise access to foreign currencies and imported goods. The project financial \nanalysis shows that project investments will be sustainable under the current policy environment \nwith reforms in the wheat and wheat seed procurement system (para. 52). The project crop \nbudget analysis showed that liberalizing the exchange rate restrictions, which will devalue the \nsum, will raise net farm incomes because the resulting increase in the cotton and wheat prices \nwill more than compensate for the rise in the farm input costs. To ensure that private ASCs and \nseed companies can operate competitively, the Government has agreed to ensure that they will ", "18 \nhave access to imported goods and foreign exchange equal to that given to state-owned or -\ncontrolled enterprises (para. 70).     \n \n67.  The policy to maintain high wheat outputs could weaken the domestic market price of \nwheat and has imposed substantial budgetary costs on the state. The Government has thus \nadopted measures to lower aggregate wheat production by lowering grain procurement quotas \n(para. 10). The Government is reviewing alternative mechanisms and policies to stabilize wheat \nprices and output in a market context. To this end, the service of a grain policy expert will be \nprovided under the TA associated with the Project to help analyze international best practices in \ngrain price stabilization policies (paras. 49\u201350).   \n \n68.  AADP\u2019s experience suggests that implementation issues experienced during the earlier \nyears of ADB operation in Uzbekistan (1996\u20132000), such as shortage of counterpart funds and \ninadequate cooperation among agencies, have been addressed by the Government and are not \nlikely to hamper project implementation. To mitigate potential project implementation risks, the \nProject will provide adequate staff training and consultant inputs to RRA, RBACs, research \ninstitutes, and regulatory agencies to ensure that these entities can deliver the envisaged \nproject outputs. Activities of the institutes and agencies will be coordinated by sub-working \ngroups under the PWG to ensure accountability for project resources. The project institutional \narrangements were also developed to ensure that the tasks assigned to agencies coincide with \ntheir mandates, thus ensuring the institutionalization of capacity building gained under the \nProject. To mitigate delays in project implementation, training in ADB operational policies and \nprocedures  has  been  and  will  be  provided  to  RRA  and  PMO  staff.  Job  descriptions  and \nqualification  requirements  have  also  been  developed,  and  RRA  gave  the  assurance  that \nqualified staff acceptable to ADB will be assigned to the PMOs, PSOs and PWG to support \nproject implementation. \n  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n69.  As a condition of loan effectiveness, COM will adopt a resolution determining that: \n \n(i)  Commencing from the cropping season of 2004, the obligatory state procurement \nquotas for wheat will not exceed 8,900 tons for Kuyi Chirchik, 7,000 tons for \nZamin, and 6,800 tons for Katakurgan. Farms and individual farmers will be \nentitled to sell their above-quota wheat to buyers at market prices or to the state \nat prices agreed on by farmers and the state.  \n \n(ii)  Commencing from the cropping season of 2004, the obligatory state procurement \nquotas for wheat seed will not exceed 445 tons for Kuyi Chirchik, 350 tons for \nZamin, and 340 tons for Katakurgan. Farms and individual farmers will be entitled \nto sell their above-quota wheat seeds to buyers at market prices or to the state at \nprices agreed on by farmers and the state. \n \n(iii)  Each agricultural enterprise or farm in the project districts shall be responsible on \nan individual basis to meet the procurement quotas assigned to the enterprise or \nfarm. \n \n(iv)  Except for the procurement quotas outlined in items (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, \nrestrictions will not be imposed with regard to the buyers and the terms of sale of \nwheat and wheat seeds to be sold by the agricultural enterprises and farms in the \nproject districts. ", "  19\n   \n \n(v)  A PSC will be established, and its composition determined. \n \n70.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  In procuring wheat and wheat seeds, the Government will ensure that farmers in \nthe project areas receive their advance preproduction financing on time, and final \npayments for wheat and wheat seeds will be remitted within three months after \ncrop delivery.    \n \n(ii)  The Government will review annually the state procurement prices for wheat and \nwheat seeds to ensure that any price adjustments fully reflect, for each quality \ngrade,  variations  in  international  prices,  changes  in  exchange  rates,  and \nreasonable charges for processing and marketing costs of wheat and wheat \nseeds.   \n \n(iii)  The Government will promote private sector participation in the production and \nmarketing of wheat and wheat seeds and will facilitate the establishment of \nprivately owned ASCs and seed companies. The Government will ensure that \nlicenses or other approvals will not be required to establish and operate ASCs, \nexcept to certify their compliance with sanitary and environmental regulations. \nThe Government will facilitate and streamline approvals and issuance of licenses \nto establish seed companies.  \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure fair market competition between the privately owned \nASCs or seed companies and state- and local government-owned or -controlled \nenterprises. \n \n(v)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  ASCs  and  seed  companies  in  the  project \ndistricts will be given equal access to supply of necessary materials on the same \nterms as any state-owned or -controlled enterprise. In particular, the Government \nwill ensure that ASCs and seed companies will have access to agrochemicals, \nfuel, spare parts, and foreign exchange on terms not less favorable than those \napplicable to any state-owned or -controlled enterprises.   \n \n(vi)  The Government will not restrict where ASCs and seed companies may operate, \nor their ability to competitively procure their inputs and sell their products and \nservices  within  and  outside  their  districts.  In  marketing  wheat  seeds,  seed \ncompanies will give due consideration of MAWR\u2019s recommendations on the agro-\nclimatic suitability of wheat varieties. \n \n(vii)  The  Government  will  abolish  by  31  December  2005  all  direct  and  indirect \nsubsidies to state-owned or -controlled machine and tractor parks in the project \ndistricts. \n \n(viii)  The Government will not interfere with business decisions of ASCs and seed \ncompanies.  The  Government  will  not  regulate  the  prices  of  farm  inputs  and \noutputs and preproduction financing terms between farmers and ASCs and the \nseed companies, and will allow seed companies and other private agricultural \nenterprises to determine prices freely based on market conditions. State seed ", "20 \nprocurement prices will apply to seed quotas allocated to seed companies in the \nproject districts. Quotas are limited to those referred to in para. 69.  \n \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n71.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $26,000,000 to the Republic of \nUzbekistan  for  the  Grain  Productivity  Improvement  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility; a \nterm of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n23 October 2003 ", "             Appendix 1    21 \n \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Project Targets/  Means of Verification  Risks/Assumptions \nVerifiable Indicators \nGoal       \nIncrease farm income  Average operating margin for  Project monitoring and  The Government will \n  rain-fed farms in project districts  evaluation (M&E) surveys,  gradually lower \n  rise from SUM19,000 per  project completion, and  obligatory state \n  hectare (ha) to SUM25,000/ha  project performance audit  procurement quotas \n  by 2008, for irrigated farms from  reports  and ease price and \n  SUM100,000/ha to SUM    quantity control on \n  160,000/ha.

Agricultural Sector Development \n1.  Arable land represents less than 10% of Uzbekistan\u2019s total land area. Of the total arable \narea of 4 million hectares (ha), 3.7 million ha are devoted to irrigated agriculture, and the \nremaining to rain-fed production. A high proportion of agricultural production is concentrated in \nthe fertile irrigated area in the central and eastern regions of the country, while rain-fed areas \nare mostly used for grain production. Crops comprise 60% of agriculture output, by value, with \ncotton and wheat as two major commodities; and livestock, 40%. About 56% of the country\u2019s \n25.6 million people live in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for about 28% of the gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), 44% of employment, and 60% of export revenues.  \n \n2.  Agriculture development of independent Uzbekistan has centered around three strategic \nthrusts: (i) generate foreign exchange earnings\u2014mainly through the sale of cotton, (ii) improve \nfood security, and (iii) improve social stability and rural incomes. As a part of the former Soviet \nUnion (FSU), Uzbekistan was the largest producer of cotton, fruits, and vegetables. About 70% \nof its total irrigated land was allocated to cotton. Fodder crops (e.g., alfalfa and legumes) were \ngrown in rotation with cotton and supported limited livestock production. During the 1990s \nUzbekistan  gradually  increased  wheat  production  while  maintaining  the  level  of  cotton \nproduction. In 1993\u20132000 cotton-fodder crop rotation was slowly replaced by cotton-wheat \nrotation. Fodder crop area fell from 1.0 million to 0.5 million ha, while cotton area fell slightly \nfrom 1.70 million to 1.45 million ha. In contrast, the area under wheat rose from 0.7 million in \n1993 to a peak of 1.5 million ha in 1997, before declining to 1.3 million ha by 2002. Aside from \nfarmers\u2019 concern over food security, expansion of the wheat growing area was driven by (i) the \nimposition  of  rising  government  mandatory  production  targets  and  procurement  quotas  on \nwheat (para. 7); (ii) weakening cotton prices; and (iii) declining irrigation supply during the \nsummer  months,  which  has  made  cotton  production  increasingly  risky.  Accompanying  the \nexpansion in growing area, wheat yield rose from 0.9 tons (t) per ha to 3.8 t/ha. The yield \nimprovement was largely attributed to the shift of cultivation area from rain-fed into irrigated \nareas and improving farmers\u2019 skills in grain cultivation. Uzbekistan\u2019s total wheat output rose \nfrom 0.6 million to 4.7 million tons in 1993\u20132002, and the country is self-sufficient in wheat.  \n \nB.  Structure of Farms \n3.  In the early 1990s Uzbekistan's agriculture was still dominated by collective and state \nfarms, 2,108 of which were in operation in 1991. Average farm size was more than 24,000 ha, \nand average number of workers per farm was more than 1,100. Urban and rural households \noperated backyard plots, outputs of which were mainly for self-consumption and supplementary \ncash incomes. Reforms in the farm structure began in the early 1990s with the creation of \nadditional household plots on the collective farms assigned to the farm employees. Such plots \n(about a third of a hectare in size) are called dehkan farms (Glossary). Both existing backyard \nand dehkan plots produce most of the country\u2019s noncommodity crops,1 and account for about \n11% of cultivated area. \n \n4.  In 1998 four laws (the Land Code and laws on private, cooperative, and dehkan farms) \nwere introduced. The new laws facilitated restructuring of the state and collective farms into \ncooperative  or  shirkat  farms  (Glossary).  A  shirkat  is  organized  by  assessing  assets  of  a \ncollective farm and apportioning shares in their value to farm members, who then enter into \n                                                 \n1  Commodity crops are wheat and cotton. ", "26  Appendix 2 \n\u201cfamily contracts\u201d with the cooperative to produce crops. The shirkat is responsible for input \nacquisition and sales of farm products. Shirkats\u2019 management structure and style of operations, \nhowever, did not undergone substantive change compared to collective farms. \n \n5.  The 1998 law also facilitated formation of private farms. These differ from dehkan and \nshirkat farms in scale (typically 10\u2013100 ha in size). Private farms can either be family- or \ncompany-owned farms and operate on long-term land leases (up to 50-years). Since 1999, \nshirkats with poor financial performance have been dissolved and transformed into private \nfarms.  As of 2002, there were about 72,400 private farms occupying 991,000 ha or 28% of the \ntotal irrigated area. The various types of farms and their composition in irrigated and rain-fed \nareas are summarized in Table A2. \n \nTable A2: Area, by Farm Type \n(area sown, \u2018000 ha) \nArea  All Farms  State and Shirkat  Private   Dehkan  \n \nIrrigated     3,541     2,145     991     405 \nRain-feda     440     382     30     28 \nTotal     3,981      2,527      1,021      433 \n         a   Data as of 2001 \n         Source: Ministry of Economy. \n \n6.  Creation of the dehkan and private farms has helped improve farm productivity. During \n1996\u20132001, virtually no output growth was observed in the shirkat farms, as a group, whereas \ndehkan and private farms experienced significant output growth.2 During the period, 30% of the \nagricultural sector output growth was generated by private farms and 70% by dehkan farms. \nCrop yields of private and dehkan farms were slightly higher than those of shirkats, but their \nproduction costs were much lower leading to higher farm profitability. Also, labor productivity in \nthe private and dehkan farms were significantly higher. The achievements of private and dehkan \nfarms have been attributed to increased control of households over farm resources, input use \nefficiency, and more direct linkage between farm performance and household income.  As of \n2002, private farms produced 27% and 38% of the country\u2019s cotton and wheat production, \nrespectively. \n \nC.  State Order System \n7.  The main mechanism regulating agricultural production and marketing in Uzbekistan has \nbeen the state order system. Up to 2002, the system had regulated cropping pattern and \nrequired farms to meet production targets for cotton and wheat. Production targets in most \ncases, had been set at high levels achieved in the 1980s, when the irrigation and drainage \nsystems functioned well. The policy required that 50% of the wheat production targets to be sold \nto  the  state.  This  quantity  is  known  as  the  state  procurement  quota.  State-determined \nprocurement prices were applied to the first 25% of the production target (half of the quota), and \na price premium of 20% over and above the procurement prices was paid to the remaining \nvolume purchased by the state. Although farmers were free to sell wheat in the domestic \nmarkets once they had fulfilled the state quotas, only about 30% of farm actual production is \nusually left for free market sale because actual wheat production had been consistently below \nthe production targets. In the case of cotton. processing (ginning) of raw cotton is still dominated \n                                                 \n2  World Bank\u2019s Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) for 2002 ", "    Appendix 2  27 \n \n \nby the state-owned enterprises. As such, virtually all cotton is procured by the state. Farmers \nreceive financial incentives in the form of additional value derived from cotton by-products.  \n \n8.  In 2001\u20132003, reforms were introduced to the state order system. Presidential Decree \non  Deepening  Reforms  in  the  Agricultural  Sector,  dated  24  March  2003,  directed  the \nGovernment to abolish the state control over cropping pattern.3  The state procurement quotas, \nhowever, remain in place. As a result of the policy dialogue under the Ak Altin Agricultural \nDevelopment Project (AADP)4 and the World Bank\u2019s Rural Enterprise Support Project (RESP), \nprocurement quotas for cotton and wheat were substantially lowered to about 25% of the \nhistorical production levels in six pilot districts. Based on the agreement with the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), the Government has agreed in 2002 to reduce the procurement quotas \nfor cotton, nationwide, to 50% of actual, rather than the state-projected production level. In 2002 \nthe Government also began to adjust the procurement prices for cotton and wheat to their \ninternational market prices, rather than state-estimated production costs, as practiced in the \npast.  The  price  adjustment  resulted  in  72%  and  57%  increases  in  the  wheat  and  cotton \nprocurement prices, respectively, between 2002 and 2003. In line with agreements with the IMF \nand an intention to end the state monopoly in cotton ginning and marketing, in December 2002 \nthe Government adopted a resolution to allow private sector participation in cotton wholesale \nand export. \n \nD.  Sector Challenges and Strategy \n9.  Despite gains in wheat output and the reforms adopted, the agriculture sector still faces \nkey  challenges.  Wheat  yields  are  highly  variable,  even  in  identical  agro-ecological  zones. \nbecause of the use of imported varieties. Wheat crops are susceptible to local pests and \ndiseases and not adapted to the high temperature and low humidity in the summer months. \nBecause of low farm profitability and inefficient delivery of farm inputs, farms are suffering from \nshortages  of  machinery,  fertilizers,  pesticides,  and  other  production  inputs.  Irrigation  and \ndrainage facilities are deteriorating because of funding shortage. Further, overly centralized \nwheat seed production has contributed to high transport costs and poor seed quality. Wheat \nfarmers need to be introduced to alternative farming practices, such as reduced tillage, selective \napplication of water and fertilizers, reduced water application. and alternative crop rotation \nregimes, to reduce farming costs and improve soil fertility. Finally, the rapid increase in wheat \nproduction has required the allocation of an estimated 0.8 million ha (25%) of well-irrigated land \nfor wheat production. This approach sacrifices the land\u2019s economic potential for cultivation of \nhigher-value crops, such as cotton, vegetables, fruits, and seeds.  \n \n10.  Sector reforms adopted in recent years (paras. 4\u20138) have been appropriate to stimulate \nproductivity and improve farm income. Nonetheless, efforts are needed to ensure that reforms \nadopted  thus  far  are  well  implemented.  Additional  measures  are  required  to  widen  the \ngeographical coverage of reforms and deepen their scope. Given the dominance of state-\nenterprises in farm input supply and agroprocessing, the reduction of procurement quotas and \nincrease in procurement prices should be accompanied by an active facilitation of private sector \nparticipation in the farm support services. This effort is necessary to promote competition and \n                                                 \n3  Crop production targets had been calculated based on the obligatory land allocation to a particular crop (cropping \npattern) and projected yields of crop. Abolition of control on cropping pattern, therefore, should result in abolition of \nthe production targets. \n4  ADB. 2001.

", "28  Appendix 2 \nintroduce market mechanism at farm-gate level, and to allow farmers independent choices in \ndetermining their production and marketing decisions. \n \n11.  To address challenges in the wheat subsector, Uzbekistan\u2019s wheat production systems \nshould be rationalized to shift wheat cultivation from well-irrigated lands to the less irrigable and \nrain-fed  lands.  To  this  end,  the  sector  must accelerate  the  introduction  of  wheat  varieties \nadaptable to local conditions and support technology extension to introduce alternative wheat \nfarming practices. \n  \nE.  Sector Institutions \n12.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR)  is  the  primary  agency \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  agricultural  policies.  Agricultural \nresearch  is  the  responsibility  of  MAWR  and  the  Academy  of  Agricultural  Sciences.  Both \nagencies  are  represented  through  the  Scientific  Production  Center  for  Agriculture  (SPCA), \nwhose director general is a deputy minister of MAWR for science and technology policy. SPCA \nhas a network of 19 commodity- or subject-oriented research institutes and is responsible for \nscientific  activities  to  develop  new  wheat  varieties.  The  institutes  have  regional  research \nstations that also provide extension services. SPCA is represented in each province (oblast) by \na small unit that coordinates activities of stations within the oblast and assures communication \nwith the local administration. The main institutes involved in grain varieties development are the \nAndijan/Galla-Aral  Cereals  and  Legumes  Research  Institute  and  Plant  Genetics  Institute. \nTechnology improvements of crop production, covering water and soil management, agricultural \nmechanization, and plant protection are, respectively, undertaken by the Central Asian Institute \nfor Irrigation Research,5 Agricultural Institute for Mechanization and Electrification, and Plant \nProtection Institute. MAWR also houses the State Commission on Varietal Testing which tests \nand approves plant varieties that can be commercially grown in the country. \n \n13.  MAWR\u2019s Crop Cultivation Branch, with a Grains Production Department and a Seed \nProduction Department, is primarily responsible for overseeing grain production and facilitating \nthe subsector development. The branch is headed by the first deputy minister of MAWR. In \nsupport of crop production, the State Center for Seed Quality Control and Certification under \nMAWR regulates seed production and marketing. MAWR\u2019s network of district offices, research \nstations,  and  affiliate  state-owned  enterprises  have  traditionally  carried  out  information \ndissemination on new technologies to the collective and shirkat farms. With the growing number \nof private and dehkan farms, extension services will increasingly be the responsibility of the \nrural business advisory centers (RBACs) that has been established in each district. RBACs are \norganized  under  an  umbrella  national  farmers  association,  the  Association  of  Dehkan  and \nPrivate Farmers. Further, in line with the agricultural sector\u2019s transformation to the market \nsystem, farm extension approach should be transformed from one that is directive and supply-\ndriven to one that is demand-driven and supportive of more independent decision making at the \nfarm level. Under the Economic Branch of MAWR, the Rural Restructuring Agency (RRA) was \nestablished  in  1998  to  facilitate  agricultural  reform\u2014including  farm  restructuring\u2014and \nmanagement of foreign-assisted loan projects. \n \n                                                 \n5  The Central Asian Institute for Irrigation Research reports directly to the Minister of Agriculture and Water \nResources, not the SPCA. ", "    Appendix 2  29 \n \n \nF.  External Assistance and Lessons Learned \n14.  The largest loan project in agriculture thus far is the Cotton Subsector Improvement \nProject of the World Bank.6 The project, implemented in 1995\u20132002, helped improve cotton \nseed quality and marketing, and introduce integrated pest management techniques and   new \nirrigation scheduling methods in cotton production. A series of advisory technical assistance \nwas provided by the European Union through its Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States program to finance (i) a pilot integrated area development project, (ii) \nfarmers\u2019 training, (iii) establishment of a food and agriculture policy unit, (iv) demonstration of \nimproved irrigation and soil management, (v) land registration improvement, (vi) wholesale \nmarket operations, and (vii) rural enterprise development. Credit funds and capacity-building \nassistance  were  provided  for  agroprocessing  under  ADB\u2019s  Rural  Enterprise  Development \nProject. 7 This assistance was continued under the Small and Medium Enterprise Development \nProject.8 The ongoing AADP, approved in 2001, provides integrated assistance in irrigation and \ndrainage system rehabilitation, capacity building of stakeholders, information extension, and \nestablishment of a farm machinery rental enterprise in the Ak Altin district of the Syrdarya \noblast. RESP supports investments in irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation, business advisory \nservices, rural microfinance, and credit line for enterprises providing farm support services. The \nproject  covers  five  districts  in  Karakalpakstan,  Andijan,  Kashkadarya,  Tashkent,  and \nSurkhandarya. \n \n15.  The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center under the Consultative Group \non International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) has also provided assistance to Uzbekistan in \nwheat varietal improvement through supply of parent breeding materials and technical training. \nWith partial funding of the ADB, the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas \nof CGIAR has also supervised pilot trials of alternative crop rotations and irrigation and soil \nmanagement techniques that will enhance crop productivity with minimal incremental costs to \nfarmers.  \n \n16.  Experience under these projects suggests that RRA and MAWR have the capacity to \ncarry out integrated research- and production-oriented projects. Implementation of the Cotton \nSubsector Improvement Project has built the capacity of MAWR in seed quality control.9 For the \nwheat subsector, additional investment is still required to test and develop promising wheat \nvarieties adaptable for introduction to a wide range of agroclimatic zones and produce adequate \nsupply of foundation seeds. Likewise, improved soil and water management techniques tested \nunder the past and ongoing projects should be disseminated over a wider geographical area.  \n                                                 \n6  The Cotton Sub-sector Improvement Project was approved on 25 May 1995, for $66 million.  \n7  ADB. 1996.

These, in turn, will on-lend to \nqualified private sector subborrowers who wish to establish agricultural service centers (ASCs) \nor wheat seed production companies in the three project districts.  \n \nB.  Participating Financial Institutions \n2.  A maximum of two financial institutions will be selected for the Project. They must meet \nthe following criteria: \n(i)  have been audited by external auditors acceptable to the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), with audit reports, covering the last 2 fiscal years, satisfactory to \nADB; \n(ii)  have a network of branches with adequate experience to extend loans to rural \nenterprises; \n(iii)  have a capital adequacy ratio of not less than 10%, to be calculated according to \nthe Basle Agreement for International Banking Supervision; \n(iv)  have  a  loan-deposit  ratio  not  exceeding  100%,  derivation  of  which  should \nexclude subloans under the Project and those backed by loans from multilateral \nand bilateral financial institutions;  \n(v)  be in compliance with the regulatory requirements of the Central Bank of the \nBorrower; and \n(vi)  have adopted adequate policies and procedures for credit operations as required \nby the Central Bank of Uzbekistan. \n3.  Within six months of loan effectiveness, two suitable PFIs willing to take part in the \nProject will be identified by the Rural Restructuring Agency in consultation with MOF. Evaluation \nand  screening  of  the  candidate  financial  institutions  will  be  facilitated  by  the  project\u2019s \ninternational and local banking experts (consultants). PFI selection will be approved by MOF \nand ADB. Within six months of loan effectiveness, credit guidelines governing the detailed \narrangements of onlending from the PFI to the end subborrowers will be drafted and approved \nby the Government and ADB. Within eight months of loan effectiveness, MOF and PFIs will \nenter into subsidiary loan agreements.  \nC.  Subborrowers \n4.  Applications for subloans will be considered from private individuals (or groups of private \nindividuals) and existing private companies (i) to establish private sector ASCs to offer farm \nsupport services within the project districts of Kuyi-Chirchik, Zamin, or Katakurgan; or (ii) to \nestablish new or expand existing operations of a company producing wheat seeds in the three \ndistricts.  \n5.  The subborrower must satisfy the following criteria for the duration of the subloan: (i) a \nmaximum projected debt-equity ratio of 80:20, (ii) a projected debt service coverage ratio of not \nless than 1.3, and (iii) a current ratio of at least 1.3. Subborrowers will be limited-liability \ncorporations or open joint stock corporations or suitable form of companies owned by private ", "Appendix 3  31\n \nparties. Corporations with government equity will not be eligible to receive subloans under the \nProject. \n \nD.  Size of Subloans \n6.  For ASCs, no subloan should be less than $100,000, or more than either $3 million or \n80% of the estimated subproject costs (whichever is less), or the equivalent thereof in other \ncurrencies,  calculated  on  the  basis  of  current  rates  of  exchange.  For  the  wheat  seed \ncompanies, no subloan should be less than $50,000, or more than either $1 million or 80% of \nthe estimated subproject costs (whichever is less), or the equivalent thereof in other currencies \ncalculated on the basis of current rates of exchange. \nE.  Duration of the Loan \n7.  Subsidiary loans from MOF to PFIs will be for a maximum of 10 years, including a \nmaximum  4-year  grace  period  on  principal  repayments.  Subloans  from  PFIs  to  the \nsubborrowers will be for a maximum period of 10 years, including a maximum 3-year grace \nperiod on principal repayments.  \nF.  Terms of Onlending \n8.  The interest rate on subloans from MOF to the PFIs will be at no less than the London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus 2%. PFIs should on-lend subloans to subborrowers at real \nmarket interest rates to take into account the cost of funds, administrative costs of providing the \nsubloan, credit risk, and a reasonable amount of profit for the PFIs. Commitment and front-end \nfees of the ADB loan to MOF will be passed on to the PFIs. PFIs will shoulder the credit risk, \nand subborrowers, the foreign exchange rate risk.  \n \n ", "3\n2\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN   \n \n                \nA\n                 p\np\n                 en\nd\n       Table A4.1: By Component Project Cost Summary      ix\n                                              4 \n         %    % Total     %    % Total\n     (SUM  million)    Foreign    Base  ($\u2019000)  Foreign    Base \n Item    Local    Foreign  Total    Exchange  Costs  Local    Foreign    Total  Exchange   Costs \n                \nA.

Objectives and Scope \n1.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to  advance  the  transformation  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s \nagricultural policies, particularly in the grain sector, toward the market system. TA activities will \ncover two components. The first will facilitate private sector investment in agriculture and be \nimplemented  in  the  districts  of  Kuyi-Chirchik  (Tashkent  province),  Zamin  (Djizak),  and \nKatakurgan (Samarkand), which will benefit from the planned reduction of state involvement in \nwheat seed production, farm input supply, provision of machinery rental, and agroprocessing. \nThe second component will help policymakers, particularly in the Ministry of Agriculture and \nWater Resources (MAWR), Ministry of Finance (MOF), and Ministry of Economy (MOE), to \nevaluate wheat policies to (i) stabilize wheat prices, which vary due to the introduction of market \nmechanisms in the subsector; (ii) identify options to secure wheat supply to the population, \nwhich  will  be  less  costly  than  the  present  wheat  self-sufficiency  program;  and  (iii)  ensure \nequitable sharing of the costs of the grain security program.  \n2.  Envisaged outputs of the TA are (i) realistic and viable business plans by potential \ninvestors for investments in agro-enterprises in the three pilot districts, for credit consideration \nby commercial finance institutions; (ii) greater understanding of local and central governments of \nthe positive role of private sector in agriculture; (iii) greater awareness among policy makers of \nmarket mechanisms available to stabilize grain prices and production; and (iv) an action plan for \nthe Government to improve grain sector policies. \nB.  Consultants \n3.  The TA will provide a total of 12 person-months of international consultant input from \none business planning expert-team leader (6 person-months), one agro-consulting management \nspecialist  (2),  and  one  grain  policy  expert  (4);  a  total  of  15  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultant input will also be provided from one financial analyst (6), one legal expert (3), and \none business management advisor (6). Except for the international grain policy expert, all \ninternational and domestic inputs will be allocated for the first TA component, for which the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will select and engage a firm of international consultants with \ndomestic associates to provide services in accordance with the terms of reference in Section C \n(Description of Tasks). The quality- and cost-based selection method and simplified technical \nproposal format will be used. For the second component, a qualified grain policy expert will be \nengaged through an individual consultant contract, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. The consultants will procure equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  \nC.  Description of Tasks \n4.  The TA consultants will work closely with staff of MAWR, MOE, MOF, rural business \nadvisory centers (RBACs), project management office (PMO), project site offices (PSOs), as \nwell  as  project  beneficiaries  and  local  governments.  The  consultants  will  accomplish  the \nfollowing tasks: \n ", "       Appendix 8          43 \n1.  Support for Private Agro-Enterprises \na.  Business Plan Preparation \n5.  The consultant will help form agricultural service centers (ASCs)\u2014private companies \nthat will provide machinery hire, input retailing, transport, and/or agroprocessing services to \nfarmers;  and  private  seed-producing  companies.  The  specialist\u2019s  specific  tasks  will  be  as \nfollows: \n(i)  In collaboration with the Rural Restructuring Agency (RRA), MAWR, and local \ngovernments,  disseminate  information  in  business  communities  within \nUzbekistan of  investment  opportunities  in ASCs and seed companies in the \ndistricts of Kuyi-Chirchik, Zamin, and Katakurgan.  \n(ii)  In collaboration with the Government and ADB, screen and identify potential \ninvestors or consortiums of investors for the pilot districts. A minimum of three \npotential ASC investors are to be identified, one for each district. A minimum of \ntwo investors should be identified for seed production. Selection of potential \ninvestors to be assisted by the TA should be based on, among other things, the \ninitial  business  strategy,  quality  of  equity  contribution  and  collateral  for \ncommercial borrowing, and experience in proposed business activities.  \n(iii)  Following  selection  of  potential  private  sector  investors,  provide  advisory \nassistance to refine business strategies and plans, which should be prepared by \nthe applicants. This process should include an assessment of market demand for \nseeds and different types of farm services and processed commodities.  \n(iv)  Help investors negotiate to secure operating and capital investment credit from \ncommercial finance institutions.  \n(v)  Help the central and local governments monitor and regulate activities of private \nenterprises established in the pilot districts. Inform key decision makers of the \npositive roles of the private sector in developing the rural agricultural economy. \n(vi)  Identify  policy  and  institutional  issues  (e.g.,  business  licensing,  taxation, \ninspection)  that  may  impede  investment  in  agricultural  enterprises  and \nrecommend actions and policy reforms needed to address the issues. \n(vii)  Develop  a  mechanism  (e.g.,  transparent  model  contracts)  to  improve  fair \ncontractual  arrangements  between  enterprises  and  farmers  and  promote \ncompetition among the enterprises. \n(viii)  Help ASCs and seed entrepreneurs established under the Project implement \nmanagement accounting and information systems to allow businesses to operate \non a sustainable basis, and to allow effective financial monitoring by creditors. \n(ix)  Through  seminars  and  presentations  disseminate  the  lessons  learned  from \npromotion  of  private  investments  in  the  pilot  districts.

Facilitate the election of \n ", "       Appendix 8          45 \nbeneficiary representatives in the committee and help in its early operations, with \nparticular attention to representation of women and their active role in project \nmonitoring. \n2.  Grain Policy Review \n(i)  Help MOE review the food security strategy and food grain production policies.  \n(ii)  Evaluate the costs to the economy of achieving grain self-sufficiency. Identify \npolicy options to ensure that the costs of national food security can be equitably \nshouldered by policy beneficiaries.  \n(iii)  Help MOE and MAWR explore how the Government can adopt a market-oriented \nmechanism to improve efficiency and lower the costs to assure stable aggregate \ngrain  production  and  wheat  prices.  Mechanisms  for  consideration  include \nestablishing efficient grain stockpiling and strategic reserve system, rolling future \ncontracts, price incentives/producers\u2019 subsidies, and improved output forecasting \ncombined with importation strategy. \n(iv)  Help the Cabinet of Ministers and MOE evaluate the policies and regulations \naffecting exports, importation, and marketing of agrochemical and fertilizers to \nliberalize volume and price restrictions.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n7.  RRA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A deputy director general of RRA, who will \nbe  the  project  director,  will  supervise  overall  TA  implementation.  A  TA  working  group, \ncomprising technical staff of RRA, MAWR, MOE, MOF, Association of Dekhan and Private \nFarmers, and other concerned agencies will be formed to implement the TA. RBACs will provide \nup to nine counterpart staff to work with the consultants. \nE.  Implementation Schedule, Reports, and Documents \n8.  The TA will be undertaken over 10 months, starting from the second quarter of 2004. \nThe consultants will submit to RRA and ADB an inception report in the middle of the second \nmonth, brief progress reports in the middle of the fourth and eighth months, a midterm report at \nthe middle of the sixth month, a comprehensive draft final report at the end of the tenth month, \nand a final report by the end of TA implementation. \nF.  Estimated Costs \n9.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $600,000  equivalent,  of  which  $400,000 \nequivalent will be provided by ADB on a grant basis.

Policy Environment \n1.  Financial and economic analyses have been carried out to assess the attractiveness of \nwheat cultivation in Uzbekistan and the sustainability of the project investments under the \ncurrent  and  future\u2014-more  liberalized\u2014-market  environments.  The  current  financial  regime \nassumed continuing implementation of agricultural policies as of 2003, including adjustment of \nstate procurement prices for wheat to international prices and abolition of state control of \ncropping pattern at the farm level. The financial analysis also assumed the adoption of reduced \nprocurement quotas for wheat and wheat seed as outlined in the project assurances. For the \ncrop budget analysis, as of October 2002 the state procurement prices for wheat and cotton \nwere estimated at 30% and 52% below their economic parity prices, respectively, while traded \nagrochemicals are 27\u201335% below their economic prices. The divergence between the financial \nand economic prices has been derived mainly from the estimated divergence of the official and \nmarket exchange rates. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.3 was used.1 Wheat seed prices \nare calculated at 50\u2013200% over the commercial grain prices, depending on genetic purity. Local \nmarket prices for wheat, for above-quota sales by farmers, were estimated at 20% over the \nstate  procurement  prices  as  in  2001\u20132002.  Liberalized  policy  environment  assumes  the \nconvergence of financial prices toward economic prices and termination of the procurement \nquota system.  \nB.  Comparative Analysis on Wheat Production \n2.  To assess the attractiveness of wheat cultivation under the current and liberalized policy \nenvironments, financial and economic gross profits of 11 crops grown in Central Asia, including \nwheat, have been estimated. Sustainable crop rotation schemes were also considered for crops \nin three main cultivation areas: well-irrigated, irrigation-deficit (Glossary), and rain-fed areas. \nThe assessment showed that wheat on average generates positive farm incomes in the three \ngrowing areas (Table A9.1). In the irrigation-deficit area, wheat provides the highest financial \nand economic returns among the crops evaluated. In the rain-fed system, crops with limited \ndemand, such as chickpeas, sesame, and safflower provide higher return than wheat. Due to \ntheir  drought  tolerance,  chickpeas  and  safflower  can  be  grown  in  rotation  with  wheat  to \nmaximize and stabilize farm incomes. On well-irrigated land, wheat generates less income than \ncotton; vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, and onions); wheat seed; and fodder crops. Depending \non farmers\u2019 preference, irrigated wheat can be grown in rotation with cotton, but this rotation \ncannot be sustained for many years as it will result in the deterioration of soil and yields of both \ncrops.  Overall  the  assessment  concluded  that  wheat  is  a  financially  and  economically  an \nattractive crop, particularly for irrigation-deficit and rain-fed areas.2 Households with backyard \nplots and private farms with good irrigation also cultivate wheat for food security and income \nstabilization.  \nC.  Financial Analysis  \n1.  Financial Analysis at Farm Level \n3.  In Kuyi Chirchik, Zamin, and Katakurgan districts, irrigated wheat areas in 2002 were \n13,455, 14,551 and 8,874 hectares (ha), respectively. No rain-fed wheat is grown in Kuyi \n                                                 \n1  The price divergence on cotton is higher due to additional value added tax on cotton ginning (processing). \n2  Estimated size of irrigation-deficit areas in each oblast is in Supplementary Appendix B. ", "48 Appendix 9 \nChirchik,  while  rain-fed  wheat  in  Zamin  and  Katakurgan  covered  6,100  and  2,800  ha, \nrespectively. The area planted to wheat in the five project oblasts of Djizak, Kashkadarya, \nSamarkand, Syrdarya, and Tashkent totaled 852,700 ha. In the oblasts, wheat production from \nirrigated areas (excluding backyard plots) was 1.40 million tons (t) from 559,700 ha, or 2.42 t/ha, \nand under rain-fed conditions, 175,800 t from 293,000 ha, or 0.6 t/ha. \nTable A9.1: Financial and Economic Crop Gross Margins  \n(constant 2002 prices) \nCrop  Growing Area  Irrigation  Gross Margins per Hectare \n    Requirement  Financial   Economic  \n      (\u2018000 m3)  (SUM)  (SUM) \nWheat   Rain-fed  NA    44,437    21,930 \nChickpea  Rain-fed  NA    60,080    44,079 \nSesame  Rain-fed  NA    162,427  124,118 \nSafflower  Rain-fed  NA    53,135    (18,991) \nAlfalfa   Rain-fed  NA    19,012    (21,396) \nCotton  ID  3.5    (27,426)      (38,293) \nWheat   ID/WI  2.5    220,550    273,048 \nGrain Maize  ID/WI  2.5  170,323    519,777 \nForage Maize  ID/WI  1.5    202,012    (5,179) \nWheat Seed   WI  2.5    578,850    998,848 \nCotton  WI  3.5  266,283     510,122 \nAlfalfa   WI  4.0    404,297    240,675 \nPotatoes  WI  5.0    1,362,416  583,096 \nTomatoes  WI  8.0    767,226    634,729 \nOnions  WI  10.2    1,627,426    1,588,850 \n    ID = irrigation deficit, m3 = cubic meters, NA = not applicable, WI = well irrigated. \n    Source: Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates. \n \n4.  Farm structures considered from the financial analysis differ markedly. Farm models \nhave been prepared to represent small and large private farm operations under rain-fed and \nirrigated conditions. Representative small and large rain-fed farms are 100 and 1,000 ha in size, \nrespectively. Small and large irrigated farms are 10 and 300 ha, respectively.  \n5.  For the financial analysis the following were assumed, irrespective of farm size: (i) with \nproject interventions, wheat yields will increase linearly to expected full development levels over \n10 years; (ii) besides annual crops, farms grow horticultural crops on 0.25 ha for small rain-fed \nfarms and 1.00 ha for large irrigated farms; (iii) fixed costs (electricity, building maintenance, \ntaxes, and insurance) are part of farm costs. The costs of production credit have been built into \nthe crop budgets as part of the variable costs.  \n6.  Under rain-fed conditions, adoption of improved and sustainable cropping systems (a \nrotation of wheat and chickpea), coupled with better availability of fertilizers and progressive \nintroduction of minimum tillage techniques, will increase average wheat yield from 0.6 t/ha to 1.4 \nt/ha in 10 years (see Table A9.5). In the irrigation deficit areas, the rotation of wheat and cotton, \nwhich is recognized as unsustainable, will be replaced by a rotation of wheat, alfalfa, and \ncotton.3 Introduction of suitable wheat varieties and improved crop rotation is projected to \nincrease wheat yield from 2.4 t/ha to 4.6 t/ha in a decade. This assumption is conservative \nbecause incremental yield increase observed in selected farms have been higher.  \n                                                 \n3  Cotton will occupy 20% of the modeled farm area, which will receive adequate irrigation. ", "Appendix 9          4  9\n \n7.  Details of farm returns for 11 crops are in Supplementary Appendix F. The farm analysis \nindicates that under rain-fed and irrigation-deficit conditions, farms devoting 71% of their area to \nwheat will realize substantial profit improvements. For the representative 100 ha rain-fed farm, \nnet income will increase from SUM18,940 ($19) to SUM48,830 ($50) per ha in project year 10. \nFor a smaller irrigation-deficit farm with 10 ha, farm income will rise from SUM100,300 ($102) to \nSUM350,700 ($360) per ha in a decade. Similarly, for a well-irrigated farm with 10 ha, incomes \nare projected to rise from SUM204,750 ($210) to SUM357,000 ($365) per ha.  \n8.  The farms\u2019 gross margin increases took account of adjustments in seed price and are \nadequate to cover costs of cultivation and harvesting services to be provided through the \nproposed agricultural service centers (ASC) in the focus districts. Similarly, recovery of royalty \npayments on super-elite seed, sale of certified seeds, and recovery of costs for extension \nmaterials are all considered affordable.  \n2.  Financial Analysis of Agricultural Service Centers \n9.  ASCs will be established to provide competitively priced services to private farmers \ncultivating wheat as part of their crop rotation. ASCs are expected to provide a broad range of \nservices, including agricultural machinery hire; workshop repair services; input supply; small \nprocessing facilities (e.g., grain milling, oilseed expelling); and transportation services. ASCs will \nbe fully privately owned with equity held by entrepreneurs, farmers, foreign joint ventures, or a \ncombination of such investors. Subloans to approved borrowers will pass from the Ministry of \nFinance through an approved participating financial institution. Criteria for eligible ASCs are in \nAppendix 3. Assuming diversification of business activities, the model of the pilot ASC analyzed \nfor the Project was based on an initial total investment of $3.75 million. ASCs, however, can \nstart as smaller units that will expand as profits accumulate.  \n10.  The analysis of individual service shows that ASCs can provide equipment rental at \nrates comparable with those charged by state-owned Machine and Tractor Parks. The model \nestimated that the ASC will purchase agricultural machinery and equipment for $1.65 million \nequivalent. The equipment rental service will be complemented by equipment repair services, \nretails of seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides, small-scale oilseed processing and flour milling, and \ntransport services.  \n11.  Financial modeling of the pilot ACS has been conducted for a 25-year period for the \ndiscounted cash-flow analysis; and for 15 years for financial projections (i.e., balance sheets, \nincome statements, and source and application of funds statements. The cash flow analysis \nshowed that investment in ASC has a financial internal rate of return of 27.5% and projected net \npresent value of $2.92 million. Table A9.2 provides the discounted cash flow analysis results. \nThe table also indicates the robustness of the ASC model. Even when the total cost stream \nincreases by 10% and the revenue stream declines by 10%, the internal rate of return is still \n18.71%. \n12.  The ASC model was also tested in terms of its performance and creditworthiness ratios. \nThe preparation of financial projections (loan repayment schedule, balance sheets, income \nstatements, retained earnings statement, source and use of funds statement) for a 15-year \nperiod illustrates ASC\u2019s ability to repay a $3.0 million subloan over a 10-year period with a 3-\nyear grace on principal repayments. The analysis showed that ASC will satisfy the criteria \nestablished for subloans under the project.

Financial Analysis of Seed Companies \n13.  The project supports the establishment of private companies for the production of rain-\nfed and irrigated wheat seed. These companies would organize the growing and processing of \nsuper-elite,  elite  and  other  certified  wheat  seed  for  sale  to  the  State  or  private  farmers. \nDiscounted  cash  flow  analysis  was  undertaken  for  two  models;  representing  wheat  seed \nproduction under irrigated and rain-fed conditions. Both models assume the purchase of new \nseed processing units with an hourly capacity of 2.5 tons for installation within an existing \nbuilding. Other investment costs are for farm machinery purchases.  \n14.  In the case of the irrigated wheat seed company, it is estimated that an investment of \n$720,000 will be required. Seeds will be grown on rented land totaling 400 ha. The company is \nexpected to process 2,700 tons of seeds each year with 1,800 tons originating from its rented ", "Appendix 9          5  1\n \nland and balance supplied by other growers under contract. In the case of the rain-fed model, \nthe nucleus farm would total 200 ha, 71.4% of which is planted to wheat each year. Another 200 \nha of wheat land is rented. A total of 2,700 tons of seed will be processed each year with 550 \ntons originating from own and rented land and the balance to be supplied under contract.  \n15.  Investments in the irrigated and rain-fed wheat seed companies is projected to yield \nFIRRs of 34.3% and 20.8%, respectively, with NPVs of $666,100 and $97,970.  \nD.  Economic Analysis \n1.  Assumptions \n16.  The  economic  analysis  has  been  carried  out  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire \napproach. Adjustments were made to remove transfer charges (i.e., taxes, duties, and interest \ncharges) and to account for a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.30 applied to prices of \ntraded goods. In view of the substantial unemployment and under employment in the rural \nareas, an average shadow wage rate of 0.8 was also introduced. The economic analysis was \nconducted over a 25-year period in 2002 constant prices. The economic farm gate prices of \nwheat were derived on an import parity basis, using Kazakhstan as location of the main wheat \nsource in the region and Russia as the dominant wheat importer/consumer.  \n2.  Economic Benefits \n17.  Incremental benefits of the Project were derived from two key components, namely the \nestimated increase in farm income per hectare and the potential expansion of wheat cultivation \narea arising from the project interventions. The increase in per hectare farm income is expected \nto come from the envisaged increase in wheat yields as well as improved farm efficiency in input \nutilization. The gains in farm efficiency will, in turn, come from more timely supply of production \ninputs and machineries, availability of better wheat varieties, and greater awareness of farmers \nof improved soil and water management practices. Further, introduction of drought resistant \nwheat varieties and alternative crop rotation schemes will also allow sustainable farming on the \nrain-fed and irrigation deficit areas. \n18.  As the national concern over food security eases and wheat yield per hectare rises, \nwheat  growing  area  under  irrigated  conditions  is  expected  to  decline.  To  further  improve \nincome, farmers would allocate more irrigated lands to higher value crops such as cotton, fruits, \nand seeds. Although such a shift in cropping pattern will be made possible only by the Project\u2019s \ntechnical and policy assistance, the benefits of the change in cropping pattern had not been \naccounted  for  in  the  economic  analysis.  Therefore,  the  project  benefits  have  been \nconservatively estimated. \n19.  Seven representative farm production models were used for the project analysis. Two for \nirrigated and rain-fed areas that do not receive project assistance (without-project scenarios). \nFive for farms benefiting from the Project assistance (with-project scenarios). Among the five \nwith-project models, three are for irrigated conditions, for farms adopting (i) improved seeds, (ii) \nimproved seeds and agronomic practices, and (iii) improved seeds, agronomic practices, and \nland leveling technology. Two models are for rain-fed farms adopting (i) improved seeds and \nagronomic practices and (ii) improved seeds, agronomic practices, and direct seed drilling \ntechnology. ", "52 Appendix 9 \n3.  Impact Area \n20.  The estimated rates of adoption of new technologies for the five with-project production \nscenarios vary. On both irrigated and rain-fed areas, it has been conservatively assumed that \nadoption of the new technologies will begin in project year three. To simulate the expansion of \nthe project impact area, a two-weighting system was adopted. The first set of weights comprised \npercentages of the wheat cultivation area that will participate or adopt the technologies to be \nintroduced under the Project. The second weights estimate the proportions of participating area \nadopting three different production models, outlined in Section 4. Table A9.4 summarizes the \nbuild up in the area expected to participate in the Project. The speed at which the participating \n(project impact) area expands depends mainly on the estimated dissemination of technology \nthrough the State and private extension services and availability of improved seeds. Given that \nthe total potential wheat growing areas in the five project oblasts of 560,000 and 330,000 ha., \nrespectively, for irrigated and rain-fed wheat, the slow rates of expansion in impact areas shown \nin Table A9.4 are considered conservative. \nTable A9.4: Participating Areas (ha) \nArea  Project Year \n  3  5  10  25 \n   \nIrrigated Wheat    29,300  107,800    273,796    273,796 \nKuyi-Chirchik District    3,500      7,500    13,350    13,350 \nZamin District    3,500       7,500    14,720    14,720 \nKatakurgan District    2,500       5,500    8,962    8,962 \n         \nTashkent Oblast    4,300     16,800    46,075    46,075 \nDjizak Oblast    3,450     13,450    37,480    37,480 \nSamarkand Oblast    4,300     16,800    46,890    46,890 \nSyrdariya Oblast    4,300     16,800    45,519    45,519 \nKashkadariya Oblast    3,450     23,450    60,800    60,800 \n   \nRain-fed Wheat    5,000     35,000    293,000    329,966 \n                    Total     34,300   142,800    566,796    603,762 \n           Source: Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.  Average Yields \n21.  As noted in para. 20, within the participating area, yields are expected to improve as \nprogress  is  made  in  the  adoption  of  technologies.  This  will  be  reflected  in  the  envisaged \nimprovement in wheat yields as shown in Table A9.5. The projected average irrigated wheat \nyields in the three project districts are expected to increase to modest levels of 3.2 to 3.8 tons \nper ha in a decade, while in the five project oblasts, average yield improvement in the coming \n10 years is modestly set at 14% over the present level. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 9          5  3\n \nTable A9.5: Projected Average Wheat Yields \nArea  Project Year \nWithout \n  Project  1  5  10  25 \n   \nIrrigated Wheat           \nKuyi-Chirchik District  3.0  3.0  3.1  3.8  5.1 \nZamin District  2.4  2.4  2.5  3.2  4.3 \nKatakurgan District  3.1  3.1  3.1  3.8  4.6 \n           \nTashkent Oblast  3.3  3.3  3.3  3.4  3.6 \nDjizak Oblast  2.2  2.2  2.4  2.6  2.6 \nSamarkand Oblast  2.6  2.6  2.8  3.0  3.0 \nSyrdarya Oblast  2.0  2.0  2.0  2.1  2.3 \nKashkadarya Oblast  2.1  2.1  2.1  2.2  2.4 \n           \nRain-fed Wheat           \nProject Area  0.60  0.60  0.86  1.35  1.56 \n       Source: Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and ADB estimates. \n5.

Total  production  of  wheat  is \nestimated to rise by 578,931 tons by 2029, or about 38% higher than the present production \nlevel in the 5 oblasts.

Economic Returns and Sensitivity Analysis  \n23.  The base-case assumptions applied in the economic analysis are considered to be \nconservative, particularly in relation to the adoption levels of technologies to be promoted under \nthe Project. The estimated project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) over the 25-year \nperiod, was estimated to be 30.8%. The net present value (NPV) of the project investment is \nestimated at SUM155,737 million with a 12% annual discount rate. The attractive EIRR for the \nProject is attributed to relatively low investment costs in relation to the substantial benefits that \nwould result from the use of improved wheat varieties and technologies.  \n24.  The  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  to  lower  yields,  prices  and  delayed  adoption  of  new \nagronomic practices and technologies and increases in costs is presented in Table A9.7. The \nanalysis showed that a 60% increase in the project costs would still yield an EIRR above the \n12% hurdle rate. Similarly, the Project will provide robust return even if the benefit streams are \nconfined  only  to  the  incremental  irrigated  wheat  production  from  the  three  focus  districts. \nFurther, the unlikely combination of 25% reduction in wheat gross revenues (either in price or \nyield) and a 25% increase in project costs, only lower the EIRR to 16.4%. The depreciation of \nthe local currency (SUM) as a result of currency convertibility will marginally increase the EIRR \nto 32.7%. \n25.  The economic gross margin analysis has shown that the production of rain-fed wheat \nunder the project will progressively change from one with a very modest economic margin to \none,  which  compares  favorably  with  other  rain-fed  crops  as  the  efficiency  of  production \nincreases. In general, the sensitivity analysis highlights the overall economic robustness of the \nProject.  \nTable A9.7: Sensitivity Analysis on Economic Return \n \nScenario  EIRR  NPV \n(%)  (SUM \nmillion) \nBase Case  30.8    155,737 \nSensitivity Analysis Scenario     \nBenefits are confined to incremental irrigated wheat output from focus     \ndistricts, combined with a 60% increase in project cost  12.9    1,935 \nWheat prices or yield decline by 25%   17.6    59,980 \nCosts increase by 25% and project benefits decline of 25%  16.4    49,605 \nTwo year delay in benefit realization  27.4    135,488 \nConvertibility of the SUM (SERF lowered from 1.3 to 1.0)   32.7    167,332 \nSwitching Values     \n% decline in project benefits needed to lower EIRR to 12%    40.0  \u2014 \n% increase in costs needed to lower EIRR to 12%  470.0  \u2014 \n\u2014 = not available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, SERF = shadow exchange rate \nfactor. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "Appendix 10   55\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.   Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nSector Identified as a National Priority in Country Poverty Analysis: \n \nThe Government has yet to develop a poverty assessment and a national strategy for poverty reduction. \nThe  most  comprehensive  poverty  assessment  conducted  to  date,  Uzbekistan  Living  Standards \nAssessment: Policies to Improve Living Standards (May 2003),1 estimated national poverty level at \n27.5% (22.5% and 30.5% for urban and rural areas, respectively). The study estimated that 70% of the \npoor reside in the rural areas. Since the living standards assessment used a food-based poverty line,2 \nthe  study  suggested  that  about  4.8  million  rural  residents  are  unable  to  meet  their  basic  food \nrequirement. \n \nTherefore, efforts to improve food production, rural incomes, and access to food\u2014through interventions \nin agriculture\u2014are key to poverty reduction. The national strategy, as outlined in the Program for \nStrengthening Reforms in Agriculture of 1998, outlines the roles of agricultural sector to ensure (i) the \nnational food security and (ii) sustained economic growth and social stability. Farming is the dominant \neconomic activity. Since independence in 1991, the Government has placed a high priority on increasing \nwheat production, as the main initiative to ensure food security.  \n \n \nContribution of the Sector/Subsector to Reduce Poverty in Uzbekistan: \n \nThe agricultural sector contributed 28% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), 60% export \nearnings, and 44% employment. The wheat subsector provides 23% of agriculture\u2019s GDP and is the \nmain staple of the country.  \n \nWheat is the second most widely produced crop in the country next to cotton, and provides more than \n50% of calorie intake of the average household. Remote and double landlocked, Uzbekistan needs an \nassured wheat supply to ensure social stability. Aside from land expansion devoted to wheat cultivation \nin the past decade, the Government allotted and encouraged the provision of garden plots from large-\nscale farms to rural farm households partly to enable households to ensure access to wheat production \nthrough  own  production  and  partly  to  compensate  for  the  low  incomes  and  limited  jobs  in  the \ncountryside. However, the 10-year experience of increasing wheat production largely through shifting \nland use from cotton and fodder crops to wheat has become more difficult to sustain due to the \ndeleterious effect of this approach on soil fertility. The Government has thus decided to try a different \nroute  of  attaining  food security.  Specifically,  current  wheat  production  levels  will  be  sustained  by \nimproving productivity levels obtained in the irrigation-deficit (Glossary) and rain-fed areas. This will \nsubsequently enable large farms as well as the private, dehkan, and garden plots to free the fertile well-\nirrigated lands from wheat cultivation for higher value crops, thereby ensuring more efficient utilization of \nscarce land and water resources. This approach is pro-poor in that the cultivation of cash crops in \nirrigated and fertile lands and wheat production in less irrigable and rain-fed areas will still address the \nfood supply needs of the rural poor and, more important, improve their chances of diversifying their \nincome sources and job opportunities. In the medium term, as wheat varieties are improved to address \ndifferent natural environment challenges, institutional capacity will be built to ensure more efficient \nextension service delivery and to enable farmers to actively participate in the selection of appropriate \ntechnologies to be introduced in the sector. \n \nThrough the release of wheat varieties better adapted to production under irrigation deficit and rain-fed \nconditions, the risks associated with wheat yield fluctuation will be reduced, so helping provide more \nstable incomes for farmers, which is particularly important for the more vulnerable rural groups. Adoption \n                                                 \n1  Document of the World Bank. \n2  The poverty threshold used in the study was based on the required 2,100 calories per person per day used in many \ncountries. The food poverty line was estimated at SUM3,601 per month in 2000 constant prices. This was about \n50% higher than the minimum wage in 2000. ", "56 Appendix 10 \nof improved and sustainable cropping systems for wheat will also safeguard the fertility of the soil and \nlimit the risk of environmental degradation. New technologies for raising the productivity of wheat \ncultivation will also lead to the creation of sustainable jobs in agriculture and the related service sector. \nThe number of jobs created in the two-month harvesting period in the project areas will total 2,750 \npersons for irrigated and 18,500 persons for rain-fed wheat areas. There will also be additional jobs \ncreated in relation to improved cotton production in irrigation-deficit areas following the adoption of new \ncrop rotations allowing the more efficient use of limited water resources. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Proposed Classification: Pro-Poor Growth \n \nThe total number of rural poor beneficiaries in the project areas is estimated at 69,000, of whom 55% \nreside in Kashkadarya, 16% in Djizak, 14% in Samarkand, 9% in Tashkent, and 6% in Syrdariya (Table \nA10). Poverty incidence, by headcount, is highest in Kashkadarya at 62.6%, more than twice the \nnational average of 27.5%. Djizak also recorded slightly higher than national average poverty incidence \nat 29.7%. The more fertile and well-irrigated areas of Tashkent and Syrdarya have lower poverty \nincidence rates of 16.9% and 8.4%, respectively. Almost all poor rural households are shirkat (Glossary) \nemployees and dekhan (Glossary) plot operators, and less than 1% are private farmers. \n \nTable A10: Rural Poor Beneficiaries by Oblast \nFarm          Rural Poor  \nArea            %           %        HCR \nHouseholds  Households\nTashkent  36,794  16.90          6,218  9.03  16.9 \nSyrdarya  46,412  21.32           3,899  5.66  8.4 \nDjizak  37,443  17.20        11,121  16.16  29.7 \nSamarkand  36,348  16.70          9,596  13.94  26.4 \nKashkadariya  60,689  27.88 37,991 55.20  62.6 \n            Total  217,686  100.00 68,825 100.00  31.5 \n        HCR = head count ratio. \n \nOf the three types of poor farm households, households employed by the shirkats are the most \nimpoverished while private households are the least. The Government\u2019s family budget survey conducted \nin 2000 revealed that the per capita expenditures of private and dehkan farms are higher than those of \nthe shirkats by about a factor of 1.4. Around two thirds of the shirkat households\u2019 expenditures are spent \nessentially on food items, in contrast to 53% and 48% for dehkan and private farm households, \nrespectively.  \n \nLow profitability of shirkat farms and limited job opportunities in the countryside are the main causes of \nrural poverty in the project oblasts. In the case of shirkat employee households, inadequate and delayed \nsalary payment is the major source of income instability. The nationwide agricultural reforms have also \nreduced public sector employment in farm enterprises. The lack of employment opportunities in rural \nareas will likely become more severe under the present population growth rate and progressive shirkat \nprivatization. In 1991\u20131999, agriculture output declined by 3.1% while the rural workforce expanded by \nalmost 25%. Assessments from participatory approaches have placed underemployment as high as 40\u2013\n70% on the shirkat farms. It was estimated that 14% of the able-bodied household members in the \nsampled  dehkan  farms  are  unemployed;  in  the  shirkat  households,  unemployment  is  10%,  while \nunemployment in the private farm households is 5%. Private and shirkat farms are the major sources of \non-farm  employment;  in  the  latter,  permanent  workers  average  less  than  60%  of  their  workforce \nindicating the ready supply of casual workers. In the garden plots, farm works are mostly performed by \nhousehold members; the plots rarely generate additional jobs for non-household members. According to \nthe Family Budget Survey (2000), the labor force participation rate among men, using the International \nLabour Organization definition, is 60%, for women is only 31%. Cultural factors are likely to be important \nreasons for lower female participation rates. High fertility rates are also important. Women with very ", "Appendix 10   57\nyoung children are much less likely to participate in the labor force. An additional child under 5 years old \nreduces the female participation rate by more than 7 percentage points. The likelihood of female \nparticipation increases, however, with more members in the household. This might be because of the \nchildcare support available in larger families. Women usually perform multiple roles around the house \nand house plots\u2014doing housework, rearing children, tending garden plots, fetching water, and providing \nadditional income by weeding and harvesting on other farms, spending about 50% of their daily time \nbudget. \n \nIn face of hardships, poor households adopt a variety of coping strategies to enhance their standard of \nliving. To augment their inadequate salaries, shirkat employees intensively farm their backyard plots \n(average of 0.17 hectare [ha]). The number of households with plots has reached 2.5 million, and the \naverage size per family increased from 0.12 to 0.19 ha per family. Income from the garden plots, while \nbetter than their wages, is generally inadequate. Additional land plots allotted in recent years are \nsometimes of poor quality and less irrigable; households lack start-up capital to purchase the inputs or to \naccess credit from formal financial institutions; and dekhan and household plot operators in general have \nlimited technical know-how. To augment household income, household members (especially the women \nand young adults) are also engaged in farm work (weeding and cotton harvesting). Families residing \nnear urban centers are engaged in off-farm work, mainly trading and services. \n \nTo reinvigorate the farming sector and generate rural employment, since 1998 the Government has \ninitiated a farm restructuring program to break up large shirkats into household-owned private farms. \nKey problems, nonetheless, remain in the forms of deteriorating irrigation facilities, shortage of farm \nmachinery, insufficient supply of good-quality seeds and agro-chemicals, poor-quality land (due to \nsalinization), and limited knowledge of more cost effective farming practices. Private farms, as in the \ncase of shirkats, encounter challenge to productivity improvement because of rigid controls on wheat \nand cotton prices and, up to 2003, state control on land allocations to various crops.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder Analysis Prepared \nA participatory rural assessment was conducted in July 2000. Issues faced by rural households were \nverified through consultations with three separate household groups: household employees of shirkat \nfarms, employees of private farms, and private farmers. Staff of concerned agencies, research institutes, \nlocal governments, and private business people were involved in project design. Agencies that were \nconsulted  include  the  State  Committee  for  Nature  Protection  (SCNP);  State  Committee  for  Land \nResources; and agriculture and water resources departments at the central level and their branches in \nTashkent, Djizak, and Samarkand, and the three project districts.  \n \nIn February 2002 and July 2003, field consultations were made involving more than 80 people, mostly \nfarmers  in  three  project  districts,  including  heads  of  associations  of  private  and  dekhan  farmers, \nhousehold members, and private businesspeople. Awareness was raised on the project rationale and its \ncomponents. Concerns, particularly on types of technologies to be introduced, farm equipment needed, \nand cost recovery mechanism, were raised and taken into account in the project design. Farmers \ninterviewed confirmed that project interventions are in line with their priority needs. Farmers also \nconcurred that project support to introduce balanced cropping patterns and improve on-farm soil and \nwater management will raise farm sustainability and incomes.  \n \nParticipation Strategy \nAwareness  raising  of  project  activities  will  continue  during  project  implementation,  through  public \nconsultations and disclosures by the project site offices and local governments, whose activities and \nfield visits will be supported by the Project.  Farmers will be consulted before design; repairs of on-farm \nirrigation  facilities;  and  selection  of  sites  for  technology  demonstration,  variety  testing,  and  seed \nproduction.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s most significant potential poverty impact is the development of institutional networks that \ntry out an array of different collaboration work of the public and private sector, research institutions and ", "58 Appendix 10 \nrural producers, direct involvement of local governments, and private sector participation in supplying \nseed and farm inputs. The representation of poor farm households in the various institutional groupings \nenvisaged in the Project will enable the poor households, not merely to serve as passive recipients of \ntechnological innovations and farm management practices, but also to become active participants in \nplanning and deciding the future of their communities. The establishment of institutional networks with \nparticipation from poor farm households will thus provide venues for the poor to be heard and, at the \nsame, will increase their capacity to become change makers. This will require that institutional networks \nenvisioned for the Project ensure broad representation and participation of poor farm households at farm \nand community levels, ensuring a minimum 30% representation of different groups (critical mass). \n \nParticipation of poor rural household beneficiaries in the different institutional groupings will be ensured \nat the initial stages when establishing the institutions. The monitoring and evaluation system that will be \nbuilt into the project will guarantee periodic assessment of participatory mechanisms of all project \nactivities.
