THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Shandong Energy Efficiency and Emission \nReduction Project.1  \n \n2.  The aim of the project is to expand investment in energy efficiency in selected energy-\nintensive industries in Shandong Province; develop energy service companies (ESCOs); and \nenhance provincial capacity to identify, finance, and manage similar energy efficiency and \nemission reduction projects. 2 The project proposes to finance the investment through a financial \nintermediation loan (FIL).3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The project has a very good fit and direct relevance with the ongoing and targeted \nenergy intensity reductions in the PRC to meet the 40%\u201345% carbon intensity4 reduction by \n2020 compared to 2005. The project follows and complements a previous Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  loan  which  successfully  introduced  onlending  mechanism  to  finance  energy \nefficiency retrofits in a similar energy-intensive Guangdong Province.5 Shandong is the second \nlargest, in terms of industrial outputs, among all provinces in the PRC. Accordingly, the industry \nsector is the main energy consumer in Shandong consuming more than three-quarters of the \ntotal energy in 2010. Moreover, the energy supply in Shandong is heavily dependent on fossil \nfuels\u2014coal  (71%)  and  oil  (26%)\u2014causing  large  emissions.  The  province\u2019s  total  energy \nconsumption in 2010 was 340 million tons of standard coal equivalent (tsce)\u2014around 10% of \nthe national total. Shandong's gross domestic product (GDP) has grown consistently at a rapid \nrate, expanding from CNY495.3 billion in 1995 to CNY3,941.6 billion in 2010. This economic \ngrowth momentum in Shandong is expected to continue in the foreseeable future putting even \ngreater emphasis on accelerating investments in energy efficiency.  \n \n4.  During  the  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan,  2006\u20132010,  Shandong  Province's  energy \nconsumption per CNY10,000 GDP declined by 22.09%.6 In 2010, its energy intensity7 improved \nto  1.025  tsce  per  CNY10,000  of  GDP.  Despite  improving  the  energy  intensity,  the \nunderinvestment in energy efficiency and the existence of many energy-intensive industries in \nthe province provide significant opportunities for further energy intensity reductions through \ntargeted investment.  \n                                                 \n1  A project preparatory technical assistance was approved on 5 June 2009 for $700,000. ADB. 2009. Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Energy Efficiency and Emission Reduction Project \nin Shandong Province. Manila (TA 7295-PRC). \n2  Examples of some of the energy-intensive industries that will be targeted by this project are iron and steel, cement, \ntextile, and paper. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  Carbon intensity is the amount of carbon by weight emitted per unit of energy consumed. It is also commonly \nreferred as greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP.  \n5  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility and Administration of Grant for the People's Republic of China for Guangdong Energy Efficiency \nand  Environment  Improvement  Investment  Program.  Manila  (MFF  0020-PRC,  approved  on  4  June,  for \n$100,000,000). All three tranches utilizing the full loan amount ($100 million) have already been approved. \n6  Shandong Provincial Government has successfully achieved its target for the 11th plan and will set an energy \nefficiency improvement target of 17% per unit of GDP by 2015. \n7  Energy intensity is a measure of the energy efficiency of a nation's economy. It is calculated as units of energy per \nunit of GDP. ", "2 \n \n5.  The  existing  industrial  energy  efficiency  financing  mechanisms  in  Shandong  benefit \nsmall projects. A large financing gap exists for medium- and large-sized energy efficiency \nprojects that involve all or part of an industrial manufacturing process for an industry.8 Three key \nbarriers  have  impeded  investment:  (i)  lack  of  familiarity  with  the  latest  energy  efficient \ntechnologies, combined with the enterprises\u2019 perception of production interruptions and/or loss \nof  revenues;  (ii)  difficulties  for  commercial  banks  to  assess  cash  flow  benefits  and  forgo \ncollateral for such investment projects which do not generate additional revenues; and (iii) lack \nof  capacity  for  evaluation  and  risk  assignments  for  energy  conservation  investments  by \ncommercial  banks.  Limited  market-based  incentive  mechanisms  to  reward  investors  for \nreducing  emissions  through  energy  efficiency  also  discourage  investors.  These  market \nimperfections warrant targeted public interventions. \n \n6.  Several measures have been adopted in designing this project to address these barriers \n(para. 5). Accordingly, the FIL modality was chosen to (i) allow multiple rollover of the ADB loan, \nthus, providing larger investments for energy efficiency over the loan tenor; (ii) build knowledge \nand capacity of provincial government and selected financial intermediary in evaluation and risk \nassignments for energy efficiency transactions; (iii) reduce transaction complexities and costs \ndue to familiarity and experience gained by the project management office (PMO) and the \nfinancial intermediary from the initial subprojects; and (iv) enhance governance and improve \nsafeguard compliance for energy efficiency investments beyond the first batch of subprojects.   \n \n7.  Consistent  with  the  Strategy  2020  goals,9 the  project  encourages  private  sector \ninvestments. In the first batch, both selected subprojects are private enterprises. The emphasis \non selecting innovative technologies in the selection of the first batch of subprojects is expected \nto be maintained and further intensified for future subprojects. The project design includes an \ninnovative package of financial incentives and rewards (para. 21) to encourage and enhance \nparticipation from similar industrial enterprises, thus, leveraging additional private investments. \nIn  addition,  specific  recommendations  and  actions  are  also  being  finalized  under  the  TA \n(footnote 1) to facilitate ESCO participation in the future subprojects. This, combined with the \nrecent PRC Circular No. 25 of the National Development and Reform Commission on ESCO \npolicy, will enhance engaging ESCO companies for the project.10  \n \n8.  The  selected  two  private  enterprises\u2014Golden  Yimeng  Group  (Golden  Yimeng)  and \nDongying Lufang Metallic Materials (Lufang)\u2014are both industrial leaders in their respective \nareas and are proposing state-of-the-art energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. \nThe Golden Yimeng subproject includes expanding the biogas capturing system to generate \npower and supply heat, using biowaste as fuel and to produce organic fertilizers, waste heat \nrecovery  and  energy  conservation  from  various  process  units,  and  using  heat  from  solar \nparabolic concentrators to supply a 6-megawatt steam turbine to generate electricity. This will \nbe the first such large-scale industrial solar application in the PRC. Lufang is among the top six \ncopper producers in the PRC. Lufang subproject will support and supplement the development \nof a zero coal copper ore smelting furnace\u2014an innovative technology. This technology will set \n                                                 \n8  The size of an energy efficiency investment is defined by the estimated investment cost of a single energy \nefficiency technology intervention. The targeted energy efficiency investments of the proposed project range from \n$10 million and above, compared with small-sized investments in the range of $1 million\u2013$5 million or less. The \nsize of an industrial enterprise is defined by its annual revenues. According to the China State Statistical Bureau \n(2008 Guidelines), enterprises are defined as medium-sized if their annual revenues are in the range of CNY30 \nmillion to CNY300 million (approximately $4.4 million to $40 million), and large if in excess of CNY300 million. \n9  ADB. 2008.

The  China  Everbright  Bank  (CEB),  Jinan  branch,  was  selected  as  the  financial \nintermediary through a competitive bidding process conducted in May 2010 (details on CEB are \nin paras. 29 and 30). The involvement of CEB, a commercial bank, in rolling over the fund will \nbring in sound banking expertise and governance in energy efficiency lending. It will also \nstrengthen  cooperation  between  the  government  agency  (the  PMO)  and  a  major  financial \ninstitution,  which  may  encourage  them  to  work  together  beyond  the  project  and  expand \ninvestments in this high priority area for the government. \n \n10.  To ensure that high standards with regard to due diligence and assessment are followed \nbeyond the first batch of subprojects, ADB, the Government of the PRC, Shandong Provincial \nGovernment (SPG), and CEB have agreed on a set of technical, financial, economic, social, and \nsafeguards criteria for selecting subborrowers and subprojects.12 This will assist the PMO and \nCEB in managing risks in future subprojects.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the project will be reduced industrial energy intensity and emissions in \nShandong Province. \n \n12.  The outcome of the project will be expanded energy efficiency investments in energy-\nintensive industries of Shandong Province. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  priority  energy  efficiency  and  emission  reduction  projects \nimplemented in selected energy-intensive industries; and (ii) capacity developed for government \nand  financial  institutions  in  planning,  investments,  and  management  of  energy  efficiency \nprojects. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  The project investment cost, including estimated rollover of funds, is estimated at $553.2 \nmillion, of which $141.8 million is for the first batch of subprojects. The total cost includes \nphysical and price contingencies, and interest and other charges during development (Table 1).  \n \n15.  The government has requested financing of up to an equivalent of $100 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance selected energy efficiency projects using the \nFIL modality, including taxes and duties.13 Provisions of the loan regulations applicable to the \nloan based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) will apply.14 The loan will have a 15-\nyear  term  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, an applicable commitment charge, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \n                                                 \n11 Further details on these two projects are in the Innovative Energy Efficiency and Emission Reduction Technologies \nfor the First Batch (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 Subproject Selection Criteria and Loan Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Goods and related transport and insurance costs will be financed by ADB loan. \n14 ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n ", "4 \n \ngovernment has the option to choose between eligible currencies and the interest rate regime. \nThe government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The longer grace period is essential to maximize the \nbenefits of FIL so that the full amount of the loan is available for relending to a greater number \nof  industries  resulting  into  increased  energy  savings  and  emissions  reduction.  A  similar \napproach was adopted for the Guangdong Energy Efficiency and Environment Improvement \nInvestment Program (footnote 5). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amount  \nA.

These charges will be \ncapitalized for the ADB loan. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSources: Project feasibility reports and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n16.  The  ADB  loan  will  be  onlent  to  selected  subprojects  through  CEB.  The  CEB  will \nestablish a separate escrow revolving account (para. 20). For subsequent subprojects, CEB will \nonlend  the  repayment  proceeds  to  the  eligible  subborrowers  via  this  escrow  account.15 \nFinancing for each subproject requires at least 25% equity from the respective sponsor or the \nsubborrower.16  \n \n17.  Both selected subprojects, in the first batch, will have equity (29%) contributions from the \nsponsors and debt financing (71%) from ADB loan. For future subprojects, it is expected that \ncommercial banks will provide debt financing together with the revolving fund. The $100 million \nFIL loan from ADB is expected to fully revolve about two times, supporting an additional eight \nbatches of subprojects.

For subsequent batches of subprojects, equity of each subloan borrower should be at least 25%. \nSources: Shandong Provincial Government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n1.  Relending and Onlending Arrangements \n \n18.  The PRC will be the borrower. The Ministry of Finance will relend the loan proceeds to \nSPG on the same terms and conditions as the loan between ADB and the PRC. SPG will make \nthe loan proceeds available to CEB, under the terms and conditions of the escrow revolving \naccount  management  agreement  for  further  onlending  to  selected  subborrowers  through \nsubloan agreements between CEB and the subborrower. \n \n2.  Specific Terms of the Financial Intermediation Loan Modality \n \n19.  To maximize the benefit from the revolving nature of the financing, the term of each \nsubloan will be no more than 6 years, including a grace period of 2 years. The loan repayment \nterm for all subprojects will match the payback period for each batch. The onlending interest \nrate will be set within the allowable band of the rate permissible by the People\u2019s Bank of China \nfor a commercial loan but would be 10% lower than the existing prime rate of the same term.17 \nThe Shandong Provincial Finance Department (SFD) will bear the risks of currency exchange \nand interest rate fluctuations. Only subprojects satisfying the selection criteria (footnote 12) and \ntechnically appraised by the PMO with the assistance of CEB will be financed for subsequent \nbatches. \n \n20.  To  ensure  that  ADB  loan  proceeds,  as  well  as  interest  payments  and  principal \nrepayments from the subborrowers are not commingled with the other funds being administered \nby CEB, a separate escrow revolving account will be established and maintained by CEB for all \ntransactions related to the project and administration of the FIL. This will ensure that the \naccount is kept distinct from CEB\u2019s own assets and provide protection against adverse results \nfrom other CEB financial operations. Since the loan proceeds will not be relent to CEB, the \nrequirement to relend ADB proceeds to a financial intermediary on terms no more favorable \nthan  ordinary  capital  resources  terms  is  not  applicable.  Rather  than  relending  the  loan \nproceeds, the funds will be made available to CEB under an escrow arrangement between SFD \nand CEB. \n \n21.  SFD will establish a Shandong energy efficiency and emission reduction account to \nprovide  support  for  the  project.  The  account  will  be  principally  funded  from  the  interest \ndifferential  between  the  FIL  onlending  rate  to  the  subborrowers  and  ADB\u2019s  interest  rate \n                                                 \n17 The interest rates of the local commercial banks in the PRC are regulated based on a prime rate declared by the \nPeople\u2019s Bank of China. However, the interest rates on individual transactions are allowed to deviate from the \nprime rate within a narrow band to reflect the credit risk of the borrower. The current prime rate in the PRC for the \nsame tenor of the subloan is 6.80%. With the 10% discount, the interest rate on the subloan will be about 6.12%. \nThe interest differential on the subloan will, therefore, be about 3.39%, if the equivalent fixed interest swap rate on \nthe ADB loan is considered. \n ", "6 \n \n(footnote 17).18 The account will be principally rebated to the subborrowers who achieve the \ntargeted energy savings, subject to monitoring and verification by independent consultants. \n \n22.  SFD will pay for the financial intermediary management fees (approximately 0.2% per \nannum of the ADB loan amount), and PMO administration costs including procurement of \nindependent  consultants  for  professional  services  based  on  the  actual  amount.  These \nprofessional services will include (i) appraisal and selection of future subprojects; (ii) subproject \ncapacity  building,  where  appropriate;  (iii)  implementation  of  ADB  monitoring  and  reporting \nrequirements for the project; (iv) subproject performance tracking and verification in terms of \nenergy savings and emission reductions; and (v) production of an operations manual as a \nreference point for future energy efficiency investments in order to replicate the experience \ngained by the PMO and financial intermediary. To meet these critical needs, a separate PMO \naccount will be opened in accordance with SFD\u2019s procedure.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The implementation arrangements summarized in Table 3 are for the first batch of \nsubprojects. Further details are in the project administration manual (PAM).19  \n \n24.  CEB will (i) conduct financial due diligence and creditworthiness of new subprojects; (ii) \nmake suitable recommendations to the PMO on subproject applications based on its financial \nassessments;  (iii)  provide  cofinancing,  if  appropriate;  (iv)  manage  disbursement,  interest \npayment, and principal collection processes; and administer the subloan portfolio; (v) manage \ncounterguarantees, securitization, and collateral issues; (vi) manage exchanges of foreign and \ndomestic currencies; (vii) ensure yearly audits of accounts; (viii) take necessary actions against \nnonperforming loans; and (ix) provide monthly reports to the PMO.20 SFD will make lending and \npricing decisions, and bear the credit risk of the subproject. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  2011\u20132016 \nEstimated  loan  completion   \ndate  19 September 2016 \nManagement     \n(i)   Oversight body  Project Leading Group \nMembers:  SFD,  Shandong  Provincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission, \nShandong  Provincial  Economic  and  Information  Technology  Commission,  and \nShandong Environment Protection Department. \n(ii)   Executing agency  Shandong Provincial Government  \n(iii)   Key  implementing  The Shandong Provincial Government has established the PMO to implement the \n  agencies  project.a  The  PMO  will  (i)  solicit  energy  efficiency  and  emission  reduction \nsubprojects;  (ii)  review  and  assess  subproject  applications  according  to  the \nselection criteria and approval process for subprojects; (iii) decide on subproject \napplications  with  help  from  the  financial  intermediary;  (iv)  oversee  the \nimplementation  of  subprojects;  (v)  ensure  environmental  and  social  safeguard \ncompliance through implementation of the environmental and social management \nsystem;  (vi)  measure  and  verify  energy  savings  and  emission  reduction  of \ncompleted subprojects; and (vii) monitor and manage the project, and produce \nquarterly reports for the project to be submitted to ADB in accordance with the \n                                                 \n18 Provision of additional counterpart funding will cover any funding shortfalls as specified in the Loan Agreement \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 CEB is expected to remain as the financial intermediary for the tenure of the ADB loan.

Procurement  must  be  from  ADB \nmember countries. Subborrowers will be encouraged to procure goods through \ncompetitive bidding or shopping when such procedures are most appropriate in the \ninterest of economy and efficiency. A procurement manual indicating the detailed \nprocurement procedure that will be used under the overall project implementation \nwill be prepared by the PMO before procurement activities are undertaken, and \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval. In case of noncompliance, CEB will \nexercise the right to recall the subloan. \nRetroactive financing and/or  Both subborrowers have requested advanced contracting and retroactive financing \nadvance contracting  up to 20% under each subloan.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \n25.  The  project  incorporates  lessons21 from  an  earlier  energy  efficiency  and  emission \nreduction project in Guangdong Province regarding design, preparation, risk assessment and \nmanagement, and implementation arrangements. Results of financial due diligence assessment \nof the first batch of subborrowers are shown in Appendix 2.22  \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Financial analysis. The financial internal rate of return is calculated for each of the \nsubprojects in the first batch as well as for both the subprojects combined which are 23.3% for \nGolden Yimeng, 22.4% for Lufang, and 22.9% for the two subprojects, respectively. Sensitivity \nanalysis shows that the subprojects are financially viable under various adverse scenarios.23 \nThe financial analysis for the first set of subprojects is assumed to be representative of the \nwhole FIL project. Specific financial criteria (footnote 12) are formulated for future batches of \n                                                 \n21 Para. 15 of Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \nindicates the main lesson learned from Guangdong project.  \n22 Financial Performance and Projections of Subproject Companies (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n23 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nsubprojects to ensure financial viability and sustainability. The financial intermediary, who will \noversee such assessments, will follow ADB guidelines. \n  \n27.  Economic  analysis.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  including  environmental \nbenefits is calculated for each of the subprojects in the first batch as well as for both the \nsubprojects combined which are 37.3% for Golden Yimeng, 39.0% for Lufang, and 38.2% for \nboth subprojects combined, respectively.24 Without environmental benefits, the internal rate of \nreturn for Golden Yimeng is 27.6%, Lufang 36.0%, and both projects combined 32.7%. The \nsensitivity  analysis  under  various  adverse  scenarios  shows  the  economic  viability  of  both \nprojects. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  Policy and regulatory risks are minimal and the benefits from the project will ensue as \nthe government and SPG are expected to maintain priority for energy intensity in line with the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment up to 2020 (para. 3) and recent ESCO policy (para. 7).  \n \n29.  A due diligence assessment was conducted for CEB,25 which is a national commercial \nbank established in 1992. In 2009, CEB was on the list of the 16 best banks of Asia, and is one \nof the top 10 banks of the PRC. ADB was a shareholder and board member of CEB from 1996 \nto 2007. During that period, ADB provided a technical assistance26 and a loan27 to enhance the \ncapacity of CEB in prudent banking practices and successfully introduced international best \npractices to CEB, particularly in credit appraisal, post disbursement loan management, and \ncorporate  governance,  which  have  also  benefited  the  CEB  Jinan  branch.  The  CEB  Jinan \nbranch, in Shandong Province, is a major onlender of loans from foreign governments and  \ninternational financial institutions,28 and is familiar with the policies and procedures of SFD. \n \n30.  By the end of 2009, CEB's total assets reached CNY1.198 trillion, with a total loan \nportfolio  of  CNY632  billion.  At  the  end  of  2009,  CEB  generated  an  operating  income  of \nCNY24.26 billion, with a net profit of CNY7.64 billion, an increase of 34.8% after excluding the \ntax preference factor of the previous year. Return on equity was 19.43% in 2009. CEB has a \nregistered capital of CNY33.43 billion. After the initial public offering in August 2010, Central \nHuijin Investment (China SAFE Investment) continues to be the single largest shareholder with \na 49.61% stake.  \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, SPG, the financial intermediary, and subborrowers. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n                                                 \n24  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial Management Assessment of China Everbright Bank Co.

Thus, it will result in reducing respiratory diseases among residents in the project area. \nHowever,  the  project  will  not  result  in  any  direct  benefits  to  low-income  households  and \ncommunities by reducing poverty. The project may provide some benefits to both men and \nwomen in employment opportunities during construction and operation, and appropriate loan \ncovenants on compliance with national labor laws are included. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n33.  The  project  is  classified  as  financial  intermediary  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples categorizations. Accordingly, an environmental and social \nmanagement  system  (ESMS)  document  will  be  prepared  based  on  the  agreed  ESMS \narrangement29 with SPG and made available for review before the first disbursement. SPG will \nupdate the ESMS document as needed, and submit it to ADB as per ESMS requirements. The \nselection criteria specify that subprojects will not involve land acquisition and resettlement, and \nwill not have any adverse impact on any ethnic minority group; this is stipulated in the project \nagreement. Environmental benefits including potential for energy efficiency improvements and \ngreenhouse gas emission reductions (Table 4) deriving from the subprojects can potentially \nbecome eligible for the Clean Development Mechanism. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Estimates for the \nFirst Batch Subprojects \nItem  Golden Yimeng  Lufang  Total \nEnergy saving (ton of standard coal equivalent per year)  95,448  62,426  157,874 \nCarbon dioxide (tons per year)  663,056  159,241  822,297 \nSulfur dioxide (tons per year)  341  645  986 \nSources: Subproject feasibility study reports and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.
