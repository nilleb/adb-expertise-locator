INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Timor-Leste requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance \nto enhance the planning and management capacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE) for skills \ndevelopment in secondary education, with emphasis on improving and expanding technical \neducation. During the July and October 2015 missions, ADB and the government reached \nagreement  on  the  objectives,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  costs,  and  terms  of \nreferences  for  consultants  for  the  technical  assistance  (TA).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s draft country operations business plan, \n2016\u20132018 for Timor-Leste.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Timor-Leste\u2019s economy has been growing rapidly, with annual non-oil gross domestic \nproduct growth averaging more than 10% during 2006\u20132013. Currently a lower middle-income \ncountry, Timor-Leste is striving to become an upper middle-income country by 2030.3 In the \nStrategic Development Plan, 2011\u20132030, the government recognizes education and training as \nkey to improving life opportunities for the population. It also identifies the shortage of skilled \nhuman resources as a critical constraint to sustaining economic development. \n \n3.  Education sector performance has been improving steadily over the past decade. The \nprimary net enrollment rate reached 93% and the presecondary gross enrollment rate (grades \n7\u20139) rose to 75% by 2013.4 For secondary education (grades 10\u201312), the gross enrollment rate \nreached 61% in 2014, with the female rate (64%) exceeding that for males (57%). Yet, net \nsecondary enrollment remains low at 27% overall. Progress has also been slow in reducing \nurban\u2013rural disparities and improving the quality of education, including learning outcomes, \nquality  of  teachers,  and  relevance  of  curriculum.  The  education  system  will  face  further \nchallenges in the coming years, as the large youth population progresses through the school \nsystem. Currently, more than half of the country\u2019s 1.16 million population is under the age of 20. \nBy 2030, the number of children eligible for presecondary and secondary education will increase \nby 45%.5 Challenges for the education system include not only accommodating an increasingly \nlarge number of youth, but also improving the quality to equip young people with the proper \nknowledge and practical skills for employment. \n \n4.  Current  employment situations  illustrate  an  urgent  need to  improve the quality  and \nrelevance of education, especially of secondary education. In 2013, only 31% of the population \naged 15 and older was in the paid workforce (both formal and informal sectors) or looking for a \njob, while 26% were engaged in subsistence work.6 The unemployment rate is the highest \namong youth (aged 15\u201324) at 22%, while the national average is 11%. The unemployment rate \nis also the highest among those with secondary education at 15% across all education groups.7 \nDespite  the  abundance  of  unemployed  youth,  the  economy  is  faced  with  a  shortage  of \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 September 2015. \n2  ADB.

Dili. \n7  According to the 2013 labor force survey, unemployment rates are 13% for those with primary education, 15% for \nthose with secondary education, and 6% for those with tertiary education. \n ", "2   \npractically skilled Timorese workers, and relies instead on many foreign workers, particularly in \ntechnical positions. Employers cite inadequate skills and poor work attitudes among young \nTimorese as the main reasons for using foreign skilled or semiskilled workers.8 \n \n5.  Recognizing the issues of skill shortages and high youth unemployment, the government \nhas committed to expand technical secondary education and improve its quality and relevance \nto labor market needs. Of approximately 50,000 students enrolled in secondary schools as of \n2014, only 11% attended technical schools (60% male and 40% female).9 This low enrollment is \nrelated to inadequate coverage of practical skills programs and lack of relevant curriculum, \nsufficiently qualified teachers, training facilities, and equipment. \n \n6.  MOE  aims  to  improve  access  to,  and  quality  of,  technical  secondary  education  to \nenhance employability and higher learning opportunities for young Timorese. To meet this goal, \nMOE has developed a policy to transform some  general secondary schools into technical \nschools. The TA will assist MOE in strengthening its planning and management capacity for \ntechnical secondary education. Specifically, the TA will support MOE in developing detailed \npolicy and implementation frameworks for expanding and improving technical education, based \non assessments of current learning outcomes, effectiveness of existing skills programs, and \nlabor market needs for priority skills programs in technical schools. The TA will also support \nMOE in piloting the implementation of new skills programs in one or two priority secondary \nschools, while ensuring labor market linkages for technical education. \n \n7.  The TA builds on ADB\u2019s ongoing grant assistance for technical and vocational education \nand  training\u2014the  Mid-Level  Skills  Training  Project\u2014under  the  Secretariat  of  State  for \nProfessional Training and Employment Policy.10 The assistance introduced mid-level training in \nconstruction and automotive trades at the postsecondary level to alleviate acute shortages of \nskilled workers amid the country\u2019s accelerated infrastructure investments. The assistance has \nhelped to establish systematic paths for young people to obtain accredited skills training, and to \nstrengthen quality assurance mechanisms under the national qualification framework. The TA \nwill help MOE establish common quality assurance mechanisms with the Secretariat of State for \nProfessional Training and Employment Policy for technical secondary education. A common \nqualification framework will enable the country to build a more integrated skills development \nsystem\u2014linking secondary education, postsecondary training systems, and tertiary education\u2014\nwhere  young  people  can  be  channeled  into  clear,  progressive  paths  for  technical  skills \ndevelopment with approved national qualifications. The emphasis of the TA on improving the \nquality  and  labor market  relevance  of  technical  education  will  contribute  to  enhancing the \ninternal and external efficiencies of education and training systems in Timor-Leste. \n \n8.  The TA is directly aligned with ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for \nTimor-Leste,  which  supports  the  country\u2019s  inclusive  development  agenda  and  capacity \ndevelopment in the transport, energy, water, urban services, education, and finance sectors. \nAmong development partners, the Korea International Cooperation Agency currently supports  \nMOE  in  secondary  education  through  its  rehabilitation  and  improvement  project  for  one \ntechnical secondary school. Development partner support for MOE is mostly concentrated at \npreschool and primary school levels.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be an increased number of technical secondary school graduates with \nimproved practical skills and learning outcomes. The outcome will be enhanced MOE capacity \nto plan and strengthen quality technical secondary education. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will deliver three outputs to achieve the expected outcome: (i) current learning \noutcomes  and  labor  market  demand  for  priority  skills  programs  in  secondary  education \nassessed,  (ii)  policy  and  implementation  frameworks  to  expand  and  improve  technical \nsecondary  education  developed,  and  (iii)  planning  and  managerial  capacity  of  MOE  and \nsecondary school officials for quality technical education enhanced.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Current learning outcomes and labor market demand for priority skills \nprograms in secondary education assessed. To develop effective implementation strategies \nto expand and improve technical schools, the strengths and shortcomings of current programs \nin secondary schools will be assessed, and labor market needs examined to identify the types \nof skills to be acquired by secondary graduates. Results from the assessments will help MOE \nofficials make informed decisions about the scope of required expansion and the types of skills \nprograms for additional technical schools. The assessments will also provide a baseline for \nmonitoring improvements in learning outcomes and skills programs of secondary education. Key \nactivities include the following: \n(i)  Assess  students\u2019  learning  outcomes  and  graduates\u2019  destinations  to  better \nunderstand  the  relevance  and  effectiveness  of  current  education  and  skills \nprograms in secondary schools. \n(ii)  Examine  the  cost-effectiveness  and  relevance  of  current  skills  programs  in \ntechnical schools. \n(iii)  Assess the appropriateness of, and labor market demand for, MOE\u2019s priority \nskills  programs  proposed  for  additional  technical  schools  (e.g.,  accounting, \nmaritime  and  fisheries,  and  information  technology),  and  identify  other  skills \nprograms based on labor market and community development needs. \n(iv)  Assess the relevance of curricula and textbooks, and recommend improvements \nin general learning and teaching methods for priority skills programs.  \n(v)  Conduct training needs assessments for teachers, and recommend programs to \nupgrade teachers\u2019 qualifications and skills to improve learning outcomes and to \nundertake priority skills programs. \n(vi)  Assess physical facilities and equipment of MOE\u2019s priority secondary schools to \nenhance the quality and relevance of practical skills and learning outcomes. \n \n12.  Output 2: Policy and implementation frameworks to expand and improve technical \nsecondary education developed. Based on the assessment results, specific implementation \nstrategies will be prepared to expand technical education. The plans will ensure close labor \nmarket linkages for technical education, quality assurance schemes for skills programs, and \nfinancing mechanisms for quality technical education. Key components will include the following: \n ", "4   \n(i)  Develop overall implementation strategies to increase the relevance, quality, and \ncoverage of technical secondary education with additional skills programs. \n(ii)  Design strategies for technical education to build close linkages with industry and \ncommunity needs, including entrepreneurship opportunities. \n(iii)  Establish assessment and certification mechanisms for secondary graduates that \nare aligned with the national qualification framework, especially existing schemes \nunder the National Labor Force Development Institute. \n(iv)  Develop financing plans for the expansion of technical schools that assure the \nquality of learning and skills programs. \n(v)  Develop pilot implementation plans for agreed priority skills programs (at least \ntwo programs) in selected MOE priority schools, ensuring demonstrated industry \nlinkages. \n(vi)  Recommend specific mechanisms to enhance data collection and management \ncapacity (e.g., student registration system, education management information \nsystem, and National Agency for Academic Assessment and Accreditation) for \nbetter monitoring of student flows and performance. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Planning  and  managerial  capacity  of  MOE  and  secondary  school \nofficials  for  quality  technical  education  enhanced.  Under  this  output,  various  capacity \ndevelopment  activities  will  be  carried  out  for  MOE  officials,  school  teachers,  and  school \nadministrators to improve the quality and effectiveness of technical secondary education. Based \non the analysis and identification of specific needs of officials and teachers, training workshops \nwill be organized. A study visit will be undertaken to other Asian countries to learn about \nsuccessful  management  practices  at  high-performing  technical  and  vocational  schools. \nConsultations  will  also  consider  incentive  structures  for  school  officials  and  teachers,  and \ndevelop options to enhance managerial and teaching capacity at MOE and technical schools. \nBased  on  financing  options  developed  under  output  2,  MOE  officials  will  be  assisted  in \npreparing specific investment strategies for technical secondary education in relation to other \nMOE priorities. The TA will also support MOE\u2019s pilot implementation of technical education \nexpansion in one or two priority schools, based on MOE\u2019s resource availability. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,080,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation  for \nconsultants,  logistic  support  and  coordination  with  school  officials,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOE will be the executing and implementing agency for the TA. The director general for \nsecondary  education  will  provide  overall  guidance  and  supervision  of  TA  implementation, \nsupported by consultants. The TA will be implemented from January 2016 to December 2018. \n \n16.  Individual consultants and a consulting firm will support TA implementation. The TA will \nengage two national consultants as individual consultants\u2014a national TA advisor and team \nleader (30 person-months) and a national TA support coordinator (32 person-months)\u2014who will \nmanage day-to-day TA implementation under the guidance of the director general for secondary \neducation.  By  coordinating  and  communicating  TA  activities  closely  with  MOE  and  school \nofficials, the national TA advisor will support MOE in enhancing its managerial capacity and \n ", "  5 \nbuilding ownership of TA outputs. A team of international (29 person-months) and national \nspecialists (13 person-months) will be recruited through a firm to produce assessment reports, \nother technical outputs, and capacity development workshops. The firm will be recruited for an \noutput-based  contract  using  the  simplified  technical  proposal  procedure.  The  international \nconsultants, through the firm, will include an international technical advisor, economic and \nfinancial  analyst,  learning  assessment  and  curriculum  specialist,  teacher  training  and \nmanagement  specialist,  and  school  facility  and  equipment  specialist.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. All TA consultants will be selected in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All \nprocurement will be carried out according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time). The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended time to time). \n \n17.  TA implementation will be monitored periodically through ADB review missions and a \nreview of consultant reports. To support monitoring and evaluation, the consultants will submit \nan inception report, a midterm report, and a final report to ADB and MOE. Assessment findings \nand reports under the TA will be presented and discussed at stakeholder meetings and capacity \ndevelopment workshops. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.
