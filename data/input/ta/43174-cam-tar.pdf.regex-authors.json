INTRODUCTION \n1.  Cambodia has a large and growing number of infrastructure investments that involve \ninvoluntary resettlement. The Government of Cambodia has requested technical assistance (TA) \nto  strengthen  capacity  for  the  design,  management,  and  supervision  of  income-restoration \nprograms (IRPs) for resettlement-affected people, including support to a pilot IRP for selected \naffected  people  living  along  National  Road  1  (NR1).  The  TA  was  included  in  the  country \noperations  business  plan  2008\u20132010. 1 The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  fielded  an \nintermittent fact-finding mission from 9 June to 10 July 2009 and reached agreement with the \nGovernment on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and consultant terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Resettlement and National Road 1 (NR1). The Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom \nPenh to Ho Chi Minh Highway Project was the first ADB-financed road in Cambodia.3 It had \nsignificant resettlement impacts and affected more than 1,000 households. Implementation of \nthe resettlement plan was a drawn-out process with some irregularities, including delayed and \ndiscounted compensation payments. Income restoration assistance for the severely affected \npeople came in the form of a $300 cash payment made several years after families were \nresettled. In 2007, a group of 63 affected people petitioned the ADB Office of the Special Project \nFacilitator  to  help  resolve  debt  issues  they  face  as  a  result  of  late  compensation.  The \nGovernment and ADB both recognize that resettlement could have been handled better and that \nmany problems could have been avoided with (i) better information to affected people regarding \neligibility, entitlements, and project timing; (ii) timely payment of full compensation as per the \nagreed resettlement plan and before households were relocated; and (iii) an IRP for the most \nvulnerable families.  \n \n3.  Impoverishment.  An  important  lesson  from  global  resettlement  experience  is  that \nimpoverishment  is  not  prevented  by  compensation  alone.  Treating  resettlement  as  an \nopportunity for development requires a change in attitudes, better legislation and procedures, an \nincrease  in  government  resources  allocated  to  IRPs,  and  an  understanding  that  cash  for \nlivelihoods is not a fair trade. Resettlement impacts in Cambodia will continue to be substantial, \nand greater capacity is needed for the crucial component of income restoration (also known as \nrehabilitation). At the same time, it is vital that the Government does not view post-construction \nIRPs as a substitute for paying adequate compensation in a timely manner. Like compensation \nfor lost assets, income restoration requires sufficient resources and should be started before \nand during project implementation. \n \n4.  Debt traps. A number of resettled families along NR1 find themselves in a vicious cycle \nof  poverty  and  indebtedness,  with  no  stable  source  of  livelihood.  Borrowing  from  informal \nmoneylenders has been the primary coping mechanism in the Stung Slot and Kraing Khok \ncommunities  of  Prey  Veng  province,  particularly  in  the  face  of  the  delayed  compensation \npayments after resettlement. Many families now have unmanageable debts to loan sharks at \nusurious rates, often as high as 10% per month. Some risk losing their resettlement site plots as \na result, while others have already been forced to sell their plots to repay debts. On the one \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business Plan (2008\u20132010): Cambodia. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 July 2009. \n3  ADB. 1999. Greater Mekong Subregion: Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh Highway Project. Manila (Loan 1659-CAM).  \n ", "2 \nhand, a 2008 resettlement audit report found that linking the affected people's debt problems to \nresettlement alone is overly simplistic because people were very poor before the project began, \nbarely earning enough to support their families.4 On the other hand, the households were highly \nvulnerable, and resettlement was a major shock. The resettlement audit thus recommended a \nlivelihood  stabilization  program  for  63  affected  people  in  the  Stung  Slot  and  Kraing  Khok \ncommunities  of  Prey  Veng  province.  The  audit  found  that  affected  people  lack  (i)  the \nunderstanding and skills required to take part in cash-oriented productive activities (such as \nproviding goods and services to road users), (ii) the assets and capital necessary to engage in \nproductive activities, and (iii) the support needed to collectively address the causes of poverty in \ntheir communities. These three areas form the core of the proposed pilot IRP.  \n \n5.  Income restoration. People living along NR1 are persistently poor because they do not \nhave access to the productive tools needed to connect into growth opportunities brought by \nimproved transport linkages. Income restoration is an essential element of resettlement and \nparticularly so for vulnerable populations. Options for IRPs include (during the construction \nphase) short-term employment on civil works at the project sites, and (before, during, and after \nconstruction) longer term strategies that include land- and non-land-based economic activities \nthat provide sustained sources of income over a longer period to enable restoring or, ideally, \nimproving families\u2019 living standards. Examples include to provide training and other inputs for \nincome  generation  and  to  establish  links  to  local,  national,  or  subregional  economic \ndevelopment and employment programs. Rural credit and microenterprise programs are also \nkey ingredients. An explicit gender focus is important where a large proportion of households \nare headed by women. This is the case among the NR1-affected people. \n \n6.  Social capital. Social capital\u2014the norms, trust, reciprocity, and networks that facilitate \ncollective action\u2014is a vital element for poverty reduction and sustainable social and economic \ndevelopment. Very low levels of social capital limit the ability of the poor to help themselves. \nSocial  capital  was  almost  totally  destroyed  in  Cambodia\u2019s  protracted  civil  conflict,  and \ninvoluntary  resettlement  can  undo  any  gains  made  since  that  time.  IRPs  that  strengthen \ncommunity organizations (such as cooperatives, self-help or savings groups) will create and \nreinforce vital social capital. Local nongovernment organizations (NGOs) helped in 2002 to set \nup savings groups in resettlement-affected communities along NR1, but a 2008 assessment \nshowed that the two groups have no vision and no clear program. The groups\u2019 leaders have not \nhad training in basic financial management, record keeping, or credit cooperative operation. The \nbookkeeping  and  accounting  systems  are  rudimentary,  and  it  is  unclear  how  funds  from \nmember contributions are used. There are no bylaws, so the rights and obligations of members \nand leaders are not spelled out. There is, in short, an urgent need for capacity development. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The expected impact will be a reduction of the poverty and vulnerability associated with \ninvoluntary  resettlement  along  Cambodia\u2019s  NR1.  The  expected  outcome  will  be  enhanced \ncapacity of the Government to design, manage, and supervise IRPs for resettlement-affected \npeople, plus improved capacity of affected people to manage their community-based self-help \norganization. By the end of implementation, government staff responsible for resettlement will \nhave participated in training on social development issues and a pilot IRP for the 63 NR1-\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008.

Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA outputs will be (i) improved social research and analysis skills for the Executing \nAgency (EA) and other line ministry staff, and (ii) improved livelihoods for poor resettlement-\naffected people in the selected pilot communities. The main activities will be (i) a capacity \ndevelopment program for staff from the EA and relevant line ministries, and (ii) a pilot IRP in the \nStung Slot and Kraing Khok communities along NR1. Relevant line ministries are those which \nserve as executing agencies for infrastructure projects with significant resettlement impacts, \nsuch as the Ministry of Public Works and Transport for roads and railways, Ministry of Water \nResources and Meteorology for irrigation, and Electricite du Cambodge for power transmission \nlines.5 Detailed  activities  under  output  1  include  documenting  best  practices  and  lessons \nlearned in IRPs both in Cambodia and elsewhere in the region; preparing and delivering a \ncapacity development program that covers social research and analysis, development, and \npoverty reduction; and preparing a handbook on IRPs. The capacity development program may \ninclude workshops, seminars, short courses, study tours, and other elements.   \n \n9.  Specific activities under output 2 include working closely with community leaders, local \nauthorities, and NGOs to update the detailed socioeconomic information on each of the 63 \naffected people belonging to the Stung Slot and Kraing Khok savings groups in Prey Veng \nprovince, plus designing and implementing a pilot IRP based on individual household needs and \nabilities. This will require extensive consultation and participation. The program will include (i) \nstrengthening the community organizations; (ii) consolidating and refinancing unsustainable \ndebts;6 (iii) delivering tailored livelihood and life skills training, and, upon successful completion \nof the training; (iv) providing credit for start-up or expansion of productive activities along with \nsignificant technical supervision and support. Items (ii) and (iv) will be financed through a \ncommunity  development  seed  fund  provided  to  the  community  organization  (estimated  at \n$100,000 but to be determined based on detailed analysis of household debts). The consultants \nwill  oversee  and  closely  document  direct  payment  to  moneylenders.  The  loan  terms  for \nrefinancing and credit will be developed in consultation with the community groups at inception. \nMembers will ultimately repay the funds to the community organization, which may then decide \nhow to productively use the funds to support its members in the future. The consultant team will \nrecruit community facilitators, possibly through an NGO that has extensive local experience, to \nspend a significant amount of time working with the communities. At least half of the facilitators \nwill be women. The consultants will provide technical and logistical assistance to the community \norganization (or cooperative) during the formative period, but the community organization\u2019s \nstrategic plans will include a clear phaseout period. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost an equivalent of $575,000, of which $500,000 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program (Technical Assistance Special Fund-\nIV). The Government will finance $75,000 in cash and in kind to cover adequate office space, \n                                                 \n5  The consultants will work with the EA and the social safeguards officer at ADB\u2019s Cambodia Resident Mission to \nidentify the most appropriate individuals from the relevant agencies to participate in the capacity development \nprogram.  \n6  A very detailed analysis of households\u2019 debt situations will be undertaken as soon as possible during the inception \nphase, and results will be compared with the household survey and debt assessment conducted in November 2007 \nand February 2008. Only resettlement-related debts will be refinanced, as agreed with community members. \n ", "4 \ncounterpart staff time and travel, and physical improvements at the Stung Slot relocation site. \nThese improvements\u2014including access road repairs and more water supply and sanitation \nfacilities\u2014will directly support the achievement of improved livelihoods under output 2. The site \nwill be upgraded to a similar level of quality as other NR1 relocation sites. A detailed cost \nestimate and financing plan is in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from November 2009 to October 2011. The \nEA will be the Resettlement Department of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. A detailed \nassessment of the 28-person Resettlement Department was undertaken in 2008 by the East \nWest Management Institute under TA for Enhancing the Resettlement Legal Framework and \nInstitutional Capacity.7 The consultants assessed leadership as strong and supportive. Through \nwork on several donor-funded projects, 11 Resettlement Department staff members have basic \nnotions of social research and development. The assessment finds that with additional in-depth \ntraining  and  further  practical,  supervised  experience  in  preparing  and  conducting  social \nresearch and analysis, some of these staff members could become in-house social research \nand  development  experts.  The  TA  will  aim  to  deliver  this  additional  training  and  practical \nexperience. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented by a development NGO or consulting firm with a proven \nrecord of community development work, including in the areas of cooperatives, microfinance, \nplus livelihood and life skills training. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB will \nengage the NGO or firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). All equipment and training services will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Assets purchased \nwill be handed over to the EA and to the community organization, as appropriate, upon project \ncompletion. The quality-based selection method will be used to choose the consultants, who will \nprepare a simplified technical proposal. Quality-based selection is proposed given the technical \ncomplexity involved and the fact that both NGOs and firms are expected to be short-listed.  \n \n13.  The consultants will prepare an inception report (within 1 month of commencing the \nassignment), brief monthly progress updates, a midterm report, a draft final report, and a final \nreport. TA outputs will be disseminated mainly through a handbook on IRPs that the consultants \nwill prepare based on (i) the review of local and regional IRPs, (ii) the experience of the pilot \nprogram, and (iii) close collaboration with the EA. The consultants will seek inputs from the \nGovernment, as well as from development partner and NGO stakeholders, during the handbook \ndevelopment  stage  and  will  widely  disseminate  the  final  handbook,  which  should  also  be \ntranslated into Khmer. All consultant reports produced under the TA will be publicly disclosed \nthrough the ADB website.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Cambodia for Capacity Development for Income Restoration Programs, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004.

Background \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  recruit  a  development  nongovernment \norganization  or  consulting  firm  (partnerships  are  encouraged)  to  implement  the  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA). The consultant team will have extensive experience in (i) \ninvoluntary resettlement and income-restoration programs, and (ii) designing and implementing \ncommunity-based  development  initiatives  that  include  setting  up  people\u2019s  organizations  and \ndesigning livelihood programs. Experience in Cambodia is essential. The consultants will mobilize \na team of international and national specialists in fields ranging from community development, \nmicrofinance, cooperatives, and gender and development to community-based adult education and \ntraining program management. Gender balance in the consultant team will be a key consideration. \n \n2.  The team leader will be an international social scientist with an advanced degree and \nextensive practical experience in social and community development, including in Cambodia. The \nconsultants  will  provide  at  least  10  person-months  of  international  and  22  person-months  of \nnational expertise, plus about 40 person-months of community facilitators who will work with and \nsupport the community groups and members on a regular basis. The deputy team leader will be a \nCambodian national with expertise in community development, livelihoods, and, ideally, income-\nrestoration programs. Fluency in English and Khmer is a prerequisite.  \n \nB.   Scope of Work \n \n3.  The  TA  will  incorporate  and  build  on  the  experience  of  two  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction (JFPR) grants in Cambodia: (i) Improving Access of Poor Floating Communities on the \nTonle Sap to Social Infrastructure and Livelihood Activities (JFPR 9064-CAM), 1 and (ii) Women\u2019s \nDevelopment  Centers  (JFPR  9081-CAM). 2  Under  JFPR  9064,  two  of  the  components \ndemonstrated  alternative  income  generating  activities  and  supported  community-based \nmicrofinance for the poor. These components were found to be particularly successful where they \nwere implemented synergistically.3 The JFPR 9081 components for life skills and advocacy support \nand micro- and small-enterprise development are highly relevant. \n \n4.  The tasks of the consultant team, under the overall guidance of the team leader will include \nto  (i)  design  and  implement  a  capacity  development  program  for  the  Executing  Agency  (the \nResettlement Department of the Ministry of Economy and Finance) and other line ministries, and \n(ii) design and pilot an income-restoration program in selected communities along National Road 1. \n \n5.

One implementing agency provided technical training and technical support on a continuous basis, while \nsetting up a village bank and training the loan management committees. The other implementing agency was a \ncommercial microfinance institution. Loan officers could only provide information on how to do business in general \nterms. As they worked for a commercial bank, they were more risk averse and sought to make larger loans to less poor \npeople (i.e., not the poorest).
