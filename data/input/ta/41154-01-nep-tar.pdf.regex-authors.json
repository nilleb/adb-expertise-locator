INTRODUCTION \n1.  Following a request from the Government of Nepal, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nincluded capacity development technical assistance (TA) in the country partnership strategy, \n2010\u20132012 for Nepal to support Nepal's energy sector in 2010.1 During consultation missions in \n2010, ADB and the Ministry of Energy (MOE) discussed the capacity development needs of \nNepal's public energy institutions and identified broad areas of possible intervention. \n \n2.  ADB fielded a TA fact-finding mission on 19\u201323 July 2010 to design the content and \nimplementation arrangements of the TA. In a letter dated 10 August 2010, the Ministry of \nFinance confirmed the aide m\u00e9moire containing the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, terms of reference of consultants, and design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Given Nepal's vast hydropower potential, the country's energy sector is poised to make \na strong contribution to the country's economic development. But years of underinvestment in \nelectricity generation have led to supply shortages. Investments have not kept up with growth in \ndemand, which increases by 9%\u201310% annually. The Nepal Electricity Authority has performed \npoorly and incurred heavy financial losses. A poor regulatory environment has added to the \nsector's problems. Nepal's electricity supply system is among the least reliable in South Asia, \ncharacterized  by  frequent  unscheduled  interruptions  and long  periods  of  scheduled  supply \noutages.  While  56%  of  households  have  electricity,  the  electrification  process  has  stalled, \nmainly  because  of  low  generation  capacity.  A  sector  that  has  the  potential  to  contribute \nsignificant foreign exchange earnings through power exports instead must import energy at \ngreat cost from neighboring India. \n \n4.  In July 2007, the National Planning Commission released the 3-year interim plan, 2008\u2013\n2010,3 which identified major proposed development interventions in Nepal. In the long term, \nthe plan envisions using the country's water resources to meet domestic electricity demand and \nincrease foreign exchange earnings from the export of surplus power. The targets set for the \nsector in the long term (up to 2027) are (i) generating 4,000 MW of power in 2027 to meet \ndomestic demand; (ii) expanding electricity services to cover 75% of the population through the \nnational grid, 20% of the population through isolated small and micro-hydropower systems, and \n5% of the population through alternative energy sources; and (iii) increasing annual per capita \nelectricity consumption to 400 kWh from the 71 kWh (2006). \n \n5.  The  key  strategies  adopted  by  the  government  to  achieve  these  targets  will  be  (i) \nimproving  regulation  of  businesses  involved  in  electricity  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution; (ii) encouraging investments in hydropower by adopting a one-stop-shop approach \nso that investors can obtain all approvals from a single agency; and (iii) expanding the capacity \nof electricity generation. Attracting private investments in hydropower will be vital to satisfying \nthe large investment needs of the energy sector. \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2009. Nepal: Country Partnership Strategy, 2010\u20132012.  Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 August 2010. \n3  National Planning Commission. 2008. Three Year Interim Plan (2007/08\u20132009/10). Nepal: National Planning \nCommission. \n ", "2   \n6.  ADB TA on promoting private participation in Nepal's electricity sector4 identified many \nbarriers to the development of large hydropower projects in Nepal. These barriers included (i) a \nlack of a clear policy, legal, and regulatory framework governing hydropower; (ii) a lack of \nconducive licensing terms and conditions; (iii) an absence of cost-based mechanisms for setting \nboth wholesale and retail tariffs, where power purchase costs are passed through to consumers; \nand  (iv)  off-takers  not  being  informed  about  the  project  developer\u2019s  cost  base  and  cost \nescalations over time. Overcoming these barriers will require (i) improved energy policies and \nregulations, and (ii) more extensive preparatory work on projects up for bidding. \n \n7.  Addressing these issues in a manner consistent with the government's energy strategy \nwill require improving the capacity of institutions\u2014particularly those dealing with hydropower\u2014\nto develop and implement effective energy policies and regulations. Capacity building efforts \nshould focus on building human resource capacity and providing software support on (i) energy \npolicy and regulation, and (ii) hydropower planning and development. The performance of the \nDepartment of Electricity Development (DOED) should be improved and its ability to respond to \nemerging hydropower development needs should be strengthened. Efforts to build capacity in \nsetting effective energy policies should target the newly formed MOE. The MOE should be \ntrained to ensure that the DOED carries out its regulatory functions within an overall policy \nframework set by the MOE. Ensuring revenue recovery in projects under consideration is vital to \nattracting private investment and ultimately ensuring the success of these projects. Ensuring \nrevenue recovery will require that consumer energy tariffs are set at sufficient levels. Building \nthe capacity of the Electricity Tariff Fixations Commission (ETFC), the agency in charge of \nsetting consumer tariffs, will therefore be critical. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be rapid development of hydropower generation in Nepal. The \noutcome of the TA will be enhanced capability of the MOE, the ETFC, and the DOED in \nhydropower policy making, regulation, planning, and investment promotion. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Updated hydropower development plans of DOED will help the developers of large \nhydropower projects identify and implement on a priority basis the most economically viable \nprojects. The evaluation tools will help the DOED accurately examine the information provided \nby the hydropower project developers. The monitoring tools will help DOED to closely follow the \nprogress of project implementation. The policy and regulatory environment will be enhanced \nthrough capacity building within the MOE, the ETFC, and the DOED. \n \n10.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. During phase I, a capacity development \nadvisor will identify the capacity building requirements of the MOE, the ETFC, and the DOED. A \ncapacity development coordinator, with the support of the advisor, will then identify specific \ntraining requirements, select the tools and experts to be utilized, and coordinate subsequent \nactivities under the TA.  \n \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2007.

Phase  II  activities  will  include  (i)  developing  policies,  plans,  and  evaluation  and \nmonitoring tools for hydropower projects; (ii) standardizing documentation submitted for project \napproval and, where possible, methodologies for evaluating private hydropower projects; (iii) \nassisting the DOED in negotiating at least one large hydropower project based on a public\u2013\nprivate partnership (PPP); and (iv) conducting in-house and external training and exchange \nprograms for MOE, ETFC and DOED staff arranged by the capacity development coordinator. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV),  and \n$100,000 will be financed by the Government of Nepal in the form of in-kind contributions such \nas counterpart staff and office accommodation. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The executing agency of the TA will be the MOE. The TA will begin in December 2010 \nand will be completed on 31 July 2012. The TA will require the services of four international \nconsultants for a total of 11 person-months, and one national consultant for 4 person-months. \nThe  consulting  team  will  include  (i)  an  energy  sector  capacity  development  advisor \n(international), (ii) a capacity development coordinator (international), (iii) a hydropower policy \nand  planning  specialist  (international),  (iv)  a  project  evaluation  and  monitoring  specialist \n(international), and (v) a legal expert (national). ADB will recruit the consultants in accordance \nwith  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nConsidering the urgency of this TA, and considering that the tasks of the consultants will be \nmostly independent and can be undertaken in parallel, all five consultants will be recruited \nindividually.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will be  made  in  accordance  the  ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The equipment \npurchased under the TA will be turned over to the DOED upon completion of the TA. \n \n14.  Every consultant except the capacity development advisor will separately submit an \ninception  report  (within  1  month  of  the  start  of  the  assignment),  an  interim  report  (after \ncompleting 50% of the allocated person-months), and a final report (after completing 90% of the \nallocated person-months). The capacity development advisor will provide inputs to the capacity \ndevelopment coordinator, whose reports will cover overall progress of the TA activities. \n \n15.  The  capacity  development  coordinator  will  present  to  ADB  and  the  government  a \nsummary of each training activity. The outputs of the consultants will be presented to the \nrelevant stakeholders during in-country seminars. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n16.
