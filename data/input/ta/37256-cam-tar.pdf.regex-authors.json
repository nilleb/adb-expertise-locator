The long-term institutional reform process of decentralizing and deconcentrating public \ndecision  making  and  service  delivery  in  Cambodia  began  in  2001  with  the  passage  of \nsupporting legislation for commune councils and sangkats.1 Since the direct election of local \ncouncils in February 2002, the legal framework defining the specific functions of commune \ncouncils has undergone some development. This level of public administration is recognized as \nhaving  an  essential  role  in  promoting  democratic  practices  and  addressing  socioeconomic \ndevelopment challenges. However, the commune councils are largely deficient in essential \ninfrastructure, and are thus seriously hampered in their capacity to positively influence the \nwelfare of local communities. To assist the Government of Cambodia in ensuring adequate \nfacilities  and  basic  equipment  for  all  commune  councils  in  the  medium  term,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in December 2002 approved the Commune Councils Development \nProject (CCDP). 2 Public administration reform and local governance are key areas of ADB \nsupport  under  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (CSP)  for  Cambodia  2005\u20132009.  In \nanticipation of the closing date of the CCDP (31 August 2006), the CSP programmed the \napproval of a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for 2005 to prepare the Second \nPhase of Support to Local Administration, to be approved in 2006.3 The ADB fielded a fact-\nfinding  mission  to  Cambodia  on  10\u201314  October  2005  to  formulate  the  PPTA  with  the \nGovernment. Appendix 1 presents the agreed design and monitoring framework.4\n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In 2001, the Government of Cambodia prioritized administrative reform at the commune \nand sangkat level as it announced plans to decentralize public administration to provincial \nauthorities and commune councils. That same year, the national assembly passed the Law on \nAdministration and Management of Communes and Sangkats, broadly defining the nature, \nfunctions,  and  powers  of  the  then  soon-to-be  elected  commune  councils,  and  a  minimal \ndevolution  of  responsibilities  and  resources  to  these  bodies.  The  first  elections  creating \ncommune councils with decentralized powers have longer-term significance for the country. \nHowever limited the powers and capacities of commune councils have been and will be in the \nnext  few  years,  the  election  of  local  councils  in  2002  was  an  important  first  step  toward \n                                                 \n1  The commune (in the case of provinces) or the sangkat (in the case of municipalities) is the lowest level of public \nsector administration. It governs the local affairs of its territory based on the Constitution, laws, royal decrees, \nsubdecrees, proclamations, and relevant norms and standards. Cambodia is divided into 20 provinces and four \nmunicipalities. Each province is divided into districts (there are 171), and each district is divided into communes \n(there are 1,510). Each municipality is divided into khans (there are 14), and each khan into sangkats (there are \n111). \n2  The CCDP is mainly designed to provide essential operating facilities and communication and transport equipment \nto, or to rehabilitate the facilities and equipment of, 440 commune councils and 24 provincial line departments. It is \ncofinanced with a loan of $10 million equivalent from ADB (Loan 1953-CAM [SF]; ADB. 2002. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for \nthe Commune Council Development Project. Manila, a grant of $3 million equivalent from the Swedish International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency, and a grant of $2.4 million equivalent from the Government of the Netherlands. \nThe Government of Cambodia is contributing $2 million in kind. The project midterm review in November 2004 \nnoted  that  239  commune  councils  had  started  building  their  offices  and  that  equipment  procurement  was \n\u201cproceeding very well.\u201d In September 2005, through a minor change in scope and the reallocation of loan proceeds, \n95 more communes were included in the project. \n3  During the ADB mission to review the CCDP in May 2004, the Department of Local Administration (DoLA) of the \nMinistry of Interior (MoI) requested ADB to consider a second phase of support for commune council facilities. For \nthis reason, the concept paper for the Project was originally titled \u201cFacilities for Commune Councils \u2013 Phase II\u201d In \nthe CSP. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 28 October 2005. \n ", "2   \ndeepening the understanding of democratic principles, rights, and freedoms. These reforms \nbegan a long-term institutional process that, it is hoped, will eventually refocus many aspects of \ngovernment and public service delivery in Cambodia. \n \n3.  The increased involvement of the elected local councils in direct public service delivery \ncan boost local voice and representation in issues such as land-use rights, common property \nand  natural  resource  use,  and  efficiency  of  public  services  from  higher  levels  of  public \nadministration,  although  the  short-  to  medium-term  effectiveness  of  the  local  councils  will \ncontinue to be hampered by deep physical, human, and institutional deficiencies. Besides the \nintrinsic  value  of  greater  participation  and  social  inclusion,  increased  transparency  and \naccountability for common and public resources can greatly promote property rights and the \nefficiency of private capital accumulation, reducing vulnerabilities in economic activity.5 The \neffectiveness  with  which  support for  the  commune  councils  in  Cambodia  can help  reduce \npoverty and lead to economic development, however, depends on the ongoing decentralization \nand  deconcentration  of  public  administration,  which  will  likewise  require  substantial  and \ncontinued technical support.6\n \n4.  Since the elections, more than 1,600 new rural and urban commune councils (11,261 \nlocal  councilors7)  have  taken  up  the  medium-term  task  of  establishing  and  internalizing \nappropriate legal, administrative, and supervision mechanisms for the very first time. This has \nbeen a daunting challenge for Cambodia, as it would be for any other developing economy, in \nview of the known weaknesses in public sector capacity. The legal framework that defines the \nspecific functions of commune councils has undergone continuous development since 2001. \nThose  functions  currently  include  the  planning  and  implementation  of  small-scale  rural \ninfrastructure, and civil and voter registration. The fundamental functions of planning and priority \nsetting, including commune investment planning and budgeting, must be quickly incorporated \nand made more transparent, to build the accountability of the commune councils.  \n \n5.  One relevant outcome of the CCDP has been the adoption of fundamental elements of \ngood  governance  by  commune  councils.  The  procedures  for  tendering,  monitoring,  and \nsupervising civil works have been well established under the CCDP, and are being performed \nby commune councils. An unprecedented opportunity has thus been created for the councils to \nlearn by doing, with suitable monitoring, and to test their capacity to incorporate good practices \nin such potentially problematic tasks. The establishment in 2001 of a National Committee to \nSupport the Commune Councils (NCSC) was an attempt to provide institutional support for \nthese newly established bodies of public administration.8 It is not clear whether it was possible \nto allocate capacity and resources to the NCSC for it to provide the much needed support, or if \n                                                 \n5  Improving civil liberties, voice, and accountability, together with ensuring a free press, has been found to be \nbeneficial in reducing corruption and the unofficial economy. There is indeed enough evidence pointing to the fact \nthat efficient and transparent local governance, together with civil liberties and the absence of corruption, enables \nnations to grow and develop faster. The last few years have witnessed an increasing interest in studying the \nimportance of transparency and accountability to reduce corruption. It has been learned that corruption arises from \nso-called supply-side factors like the existence of economic rents stemming from the lack of accountability in public \nsectors. Education and awareness campaigns to inform citizens about the negative effects of corruption may help. \nBut successful experiences have worked to protect property rights, get rid of administrative pricing, simplify laws, \nensure transparency and strengthen accountability in local public administration, reduce red tape and bureaucracy, \nand strengthen democratic principles at the grassroots level. \n6  The effectiveness of whatever functions the communes undertake in the process of decentralization will always \ndepend on the deconcentration of supporting functions to the provinces and districts. \n7  The commune councils have between four and eight elected representatives, each with a five-year term. \n8  The NCSC comprises representatives from six ministries and the Council of Ministers. It is chaired by the MoI, \nwhose Department of Local Administration serves as NCSC secretariat.  ", "  3\nits work plan was concrete enough. What is clear, however, is the increasingly urgent need for \ninstitutional  mechanisms  in  public  administration  for  continuously  assessing  needs  and \ncoordinating donor support activities. \n \n6.  In June 2005, the Government of Cambodia approved the Strategic Framework for \nDecentralization and Deconcentration (SFDD), establishing the objectives and principles of the \nreforms in public management systems and structures. The aim was to include in the SFDD all \npolicies,  legal  instruments,  and  operational  procedures  of  ministries  and  institutions  of  the \nGovernment regarding the management and distribution of responsibilities and resources to \nprovincial and municipal, district and khan, and commune and sangkat levels. The Government \nacknowledges  in  the  SFDD  that  the  current  public  management  system  at  provincial  and \nmunicipal level \u201cdoes not have coherence\u201d and \u201ccannot plan, budget, manage personnel and \ncoordinate the full delivery of services and development\u201d; that at the district and khan level, \n\u201ccoordination and management is weak\u201d and there is \u201clack of consistency in the areas of \noperation  in  the  delivery  of  public  services  of  some  ministries  and  institutions\u201d;  and  that \n\u201ccapacity of the communes/sangkats is low, inter-commune/sangkat cooperation has not yet \nbeen  put  in  place,  management  systems  and  structures  at  provincial/municipal  level  for \nprovision of support and control legality of local administration has not been strengthened.\u201d  \n  \n7.  At the moment, public administration in Cambodia is a rather centralized system of \npublic service provision that relies on mildly deconcentrated functions for geographic coverage.9 \nThe coordination and management of these deconcentrated functions of different ministries is \nexpected to be done at the provincial and municipal, as well as the district and khan, level by \nrepresentatives of the Government of Cambodia.10 Accountability is severely constrained by the \ndifferent vertical lines of authority and the unavoidable horizontal overlap of duties between \nministries. The SFDD aims to divert these lines of authority to the provincial governments and \ndistrict administrations, and to avoid functional overlap and duplication. This would mean not \nonly devolving decision-making authority over service delivery systems to lower levels of public \nadministration, but also significantly reallocating national budget resources and civil servants \nacross  ministries.  Organic  laws  under  preparation  will  implement  these  major  changes  by \ndefining  the  specific  functions  and  resources  (human  and  financial)  to  be  devolved  or \ntransferred between levels of public administration and ministries. As expected, this process will \nbe subject to intense interministerial scrutiny until the exact changes are clearly defined.  \n \n8.  In all cases, local administration is expected to assume a much bigger set of duties, \nirrespective of the exact split of functions between the national and provincial governments. But \nstark  deficiencies  in  institutional,  physical,  and  human  capacity  threaten  to  jeopardize  the \ncontinuity  and  consistency  of  public  service  delivery,  and  the  impact  on  local  voice  and \nrepresentation.11 In view of the current decentralization and deconcentration challenges, the \nenvisioned second phase of support to local public administration in Cambodia must take a \nholistic approach. Above all, some degree of flexibility during PPTA implementation will be \n                                                 \n9  Mainly from the national to the provincial and municipal level. Departments or agencies at the provincial and \nmunicipal, or district and khan, level,  whose staff is part of the line ministries, are now in charge of the \n\u201cdeconcentrated\u201d provision of public services, under the command of the national Government in Phnom Penh. \nThe SFDP makes the services the main responsibility of \u201cdecentralized government\u201d units (at the provincial and \nmunicipal, district and khan, and commune and sangkat levels).  \n10  The provincial or municipal governor, and the district or khan administrator. \n11  At this stage most commune councils have only one clerk\u2014a person who works in the office, keeps records, and \nperforms general office duties. Also, commune councils are required to draw up a 5-year commune development \nplan, a commune annual budget, and a commune investment plan, and have been involved in civil works \ntendering, monitoring, and supervision, but there are no official commune and district administration manuals and \nno institutional structure for the production, revision, and maintenance of such manuals. \n ", "4   \nnecessary  to  (i)  take  into  account  the  further  definition,  in  2006,  of  how  the  overall \ndecentralization and deconcentration is to progress, and (ii) be responsive to requests from the \nGovernment for the conceptualization of the overall process.  \n \n9.  The PPTA will explore the possibilities and conditions under which the systematic use of \ninformation and communications technology by local administration (and by its institutional \nstructures of support) can make public services delivery more efficient and effective and give \nthe public greater access to information.12 It will propose ways of strengthening the institutional \nstructures of support to local administration that would enhance the effectiveness of current \ncapacity-building initiatives and ensure continuity of benefits. 13 The PPTA will also seek to focus \non possible interfaces between commune councils and the district administration, which is less \nconstrained by deficiencies in human capacity. Overall, there is a strong consensus that, while \nthe new councils and district administrators must be housed, communication networks built, and \ncommune boundaries eventually reviewed, much-needed reforms must now be carried out to \nestablish legal, institutional, and human capacities. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected outcome of the PPTA will be the design of the Second Phase of Support \nto Local Public Administration, to be agreed on by the Government of Cambodia and ADB, and \nconsistent with the overall decentralization and deconcentration of public administration. Its \nexpected ultimate impact is to assist the Government in its efforts to reduce poverty and spur \nbroad-based economic growth by supporting local public administration in (i) managing the \ndemocratic development of communities; (ii) being more effective as grass-root mechanisms to \nstrengthen accountability, responsiveness and transparency of public sector administration; and \n(iii) improving the effectiveness and reach of public service delivery in Cambodia. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The PPTA will produce technical assessments and recommendations, and engage in all \nthe necessary stakeholder consultation, to enable the design of the Second Phase of Support to \nLocal Administration in Cambodia. To be consistent with the overall process of decentralization \nand  deconcentration  of  public  administration,  the  designed  project  will  have  four  main \ncomponents:  additional  support  for  commune  council  facilities  (component  A);  support  for \ndistrict administration facilities (component B); communications and information technology (IT) \nsupport to local public administration (component C); and institutional development and capacity \nbuilding  (component  D).  The  subcomponents  are  presented  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework  (Appendix  1).  Different  technical  and  financial  assistance  options  for  the \ndecentralization and deconcentration reforms will be explored. Evaluations or perceived results \n                                                 \n12 The effective use of information technology (IT) in local administration is likely to be constrained by physical \ndeficiencies that will take time to be eliminated (although some forms of public service provision, like registration of \nbirths, deaths, residence, and migration, can already be much enhanced with the use of IT). However, the use of IT \nand institutional mechanisms in providing relevant and correct information at the local level is thought to have \nsignificant potential for increasing government accountability, minimizing the informal costs to citizens in dealing \nwith public bureaucracy, and maximizing the impact of public services (see Appendix 3). \n13 Current capacity-building initiatives of the Government of Cambodia and different donors do not necessarily \ncoordinate, seek consistency, evaluate and share results, use common training materials, use existing education \nstructures for public administration, or adjust training materials to suit the functions of specific levels of public \nadministration.  ", "  5\nof the CCDP will inform the design. Workshops at various levels of public administration and \nwith different stakeholders will be held to strengthen cooperation, agreement, and ownership of \nthe ensuing project. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $475,000 equivalent\u2014$392,000 in foreign \nexchange costs and $83,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government of Cambodia \nhas requested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent, which covers the entire foreign currency \ncosts and $8,000 equivalent in local currency costs. This will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government of Cambodia will \nfinance the remaining $75,000 equivalent in local currency costs, by providing counterpart staff, \noffice space, and other requirements. The Government of Cambodia has been informed that \napproval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Ministry of Interior is the Executing Agency (EA). Implementing agencies will be \ncommune councils and district administrations throughout the country. The results of the CCDP \n(the previous project) will inform the design of the Second Phase of Support to Local Public \nAdministration, and will also be disseminated throughout the country. The TA will be undertaken \nover 8 months, and is expected to begin in February 2006 and to be completed in October 2006. \nAbout  22  person-months  of  consulting  services  (12  international  and  10  domestic)  will  be \nrequired.  The  international  team  will  comprise  the  following  experts:  (i)  international  local \nadministration facilities specialist, (ii) international ICT specialist, (iii) international institutional \ndevelopment and capacity-building specialist, and (iv) international public financial management \nspecialist. Four domestic consultants will support the international consultants.14 All consultants \nwill be hired individually according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the hiring of domestic consultants. The outline terms of \nreference for the various consultants are in Appendix 4. The reporting requirements for each \nsubcomponent  are  presented  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1). \nProcurement under the TA will be according to ADB\u2019s guidelines for procurement. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia  for  preparing  the  Second  Phase  of  Support  to  Local \nAdministration in Cambodia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n14 Besides these international and domestic experts, and contingent on other specific sources of funding being \nsecured for the preparation of a Gender strategic framework, two consultants (one international for 1.5 person-\nmonths and one domestic for 1.5 person-months) will be hired.

Local public administration is seen to \nhave an essential role in promoting democratic practices and meeting the socioeconomic development challenges of \nthe country. It can increase local voice and representation in issues such as land-use rights, common property and \nnatural resources use, and the efficiency of public services. Increased transparency and accountability for common \nand public resources can greatly promote property rights and the efficiency of private capital accumulation, reducing \nvulnerabilities in economic activity. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intevention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe national growth and poverty eradication strategy of the Government of Cambodia puts a strong emphasis on \ndecentralization, as well as governance and institutional capacity, reforms. ADB, which has been actively involved in \nthe formulation of this strategy, similarly assigns a key role to public administration reform and local governance in \nADB support under the current CSP. The potential impact of the TA on local governance and capacity for public \nservice delivery is deemed to be significantly positive. No adverse impact requiring mitigating measures was identified. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?

Also, the design of the ensuing project (Second Phase of Support to Local Administration) shall include \nmechanisms and routines that will allow stakeholders to benefit from systematic participation.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe design of the TA will be aimed at supporting crucial long-term institutional reforms in Cambodia that will, in time, \nrefocus many aspects of government and public service delivery in Cambodia. Accordingly, the TA will seek to identify \ngender concerns and contribute to reducing discrimination. The project will build on the achievements of the CCDP \nand benefit from the recently prepared gender assessment (the output referred to below). \n \nHas an output been prepared?
