During the Country programming Mission in April 2003, the government reaffirmed its \nearlier request for technical assistance (TA) to extend to the remaining ministries and provincial \ngovernments, the outputs of TA 33091 that have been pilot-tested in four line ministries and one \nprovince.  This  TA  is  included  in  the  country  strategy  and  program  for  2003.2  An  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) fact-finding mission visited the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR) on 16\u201330 June 2003 and held discussions with officials of the accounting, budget, \nexternal relations, inspections and treasury departments of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), \nofficials  of  the  ministries  of  agriculture  and  forestry;  education;  health;  foreign  affairs; \ncommunications,  transport,  post,  and  constructions;  information  and  culture;  and \nrepresentatives of the State Audit Authority (SAA), departments of finance and treasury of \nLuang  Prabang  Province,  and  selected  international  agencies.3  The  mission  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government on the purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA consultants. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The commencement of the economic reform program in the Lao PDR early in the 1990s \naccelerated economic growth and increased the level of foreign assistance and the number of \nfinancial  transactions  of  the  government.  These  are  positive  developments  that,  with  the \nappropriate  financial  systems  in  place,  will  ensure  adequate  control  and  monitoring  of \ngovernment expenditure. However, there is a need to improve the internal control systems, \ntransaction recording, financial reporting, cash management, compliance and auditing and the \ncapacity, and commitment of those involved. In recognition of the need, the TA will coordinate \nwith and complement other ADB assistance in the SAA and Public Sector Investment Program. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) is also committed to providing TA, to develop treasury \nand budget regulations. \n \n3.  While some progress has been made in simplifying the methodology for capturing \nrevenue  transactions  and  documenting  the  amount  of  revenue  due  to  the  government,4 \nprovinces that collect most of the revenue fail to remit total collections to the central agency as \nrequired. These transactions have to be properly recorded, collected, transmitted, and reported \nto the provincial and national treasuries for effective cash management. The IMF and United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP) support in this area has provided the groundwork \nnecessary  to  simplify  the  collection  process  and  enhance  uniform  application  of  revenue \npolicies.  \n \n4.  ADB has provided TA to enable the government to address the weaknesses of its \nbudget expenditure control and management system (footnote 1). This addressed the following \naccounting and financial management challenges: (i) key financial reports were not readily \navailable, (ii) accounting and internal control systems were very weak, and (iii) coordination \nbetween line ministries and provincial and central government agencies was very slow mainly \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Enhancing Government Accounting Regulations and Procedures. Manila. \n2  The TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 4 February 2003. \n3  The mission consisted of Mr. Samiuela Tukuafu, financial management specialist and mission leader, and was \nassisted by Mr. Souksavanh Vixathep of the Lao Resident Mission. \n4  Accomplished with TA from IMF, United Nations Development Programme and Swedish International Development \nCooperation Agency (SIDA). ", "2  \nbecause accounting and financial staff did not have the required skills. Furthermore Prime \nMinisterial Decree 20 of 1993, which was the main legislation for government accounting, \nlacked the appropriate regulations and procedures for implementation. \n5.  Based on the output of the TA, the Minister of Finance approved the Government \nAccounting  Regulations  and  Procedures  (MOF/1301)  on  28  June  2002.  The  accounting \nregulations comprise 14 sections covering matters ranging from revenue collection, control, and \nmanagement  to  expenditure  control  and  management,  with  each  section  defining  the \nrequirements that must be observed by line ministries and provinces in initiating, processing, \nand conducting financial transactions. The accounting procedures include revised accounting \nforms, budget monitoring reports, seven new sets of annual public financial statements, and the \nkey internal control features that must be followed by those administering fiscal transactions. \nTraining seminars were also conducted throughout the Lao PDR to heighten awareness of how \nto apply the approved regulations and procedures.   \n6.  The  seven  new  sets  of  financial  statements  will  disclose  additional  details  on  the \nfinancial condition of the government in terms of liquidity and revenue sources. Training in this \narea will commence when MOF decides on the extent of their use across government. The TA \nteam has added to the accounting procedures a set of instructions detailing the steps needed \nwhen compiling these statements at year-end. Thirty-nine new or revised accounting forms have \nbeen pilot-tested and are included in the accounting procedures. An inspection manual was also \ndeveloped and translated to the Lao language for the use of MOF\u2019s Inspection Department. \nTraining was provided to the staff of the Inspection Department, and the director of inspection \napproved the manual for application by central and provincial governments. \n \n7.  Accounting software and a user manual in the Lao language have been developed to \nsupport the establishment and maintenance of the recurrent budget accounting system. The \naccounting package has been installed and pilot-tested in the finance departments of four \nministries (agriculture and forestry, education, finance and health), Mahosot Hospital, National \nUniversity of Lao, and Savannakhet Province. Training in its installation and maintenance has \nbeen conducted at the four pilot ministries, Mahosot Hospital, National University of Lao, and \nSavannakhet Province with the new computer equipment provided. Additional developments \ninclude a local area network for Savannakhet Province to capture accounting transactions from \neach unit of the provincial treasury and a website application to enable on-line access to the \nrecurrent budget performance of the pilot ministries and province by the National Treasury and \nBudget Department (MOF).  \n \n8.  The pilot testing of the accounting package has been successful and the Government is \nkeen to extend the benefits to the remaining central ministries, provincial governments and \nagencies. Success in establishing and managing a more transparent national budget control \nand management system will help reduce the annual fiscal deficits, provide recurrent reserve to \nsustain development projects, and indicate to the funding community that the Lao PDR\u2019s reform \nprograms are effective.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA will assist the Government in its continuing efforts to generate good quality \nfinancial reports on its fiscal activities on a timely manner and to improve the capacity of its \naccounting  and  financial  staff  in  performing  those  tasks.  The  TA  will  extend  the  outputs ", "  3\ndeveloped and pilot-tested under an earlier TA (footnote 1) to the remaining 28 line ministries \nand 17 provincial governments. This will (i) enable effective policy and decision making; (ii) \nsupport  efficient  allocation  of  public  resources;  and  (iii)  facilitate  the  proper  discharge  of \ngovernment functions and responsibilities by a fair and proper assessment of performance and \ncompliance with legislation, regulations, procedures, and good governance practices. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will comprise three core components. It will (i) extend the application of the \napproved accounting regulations and procedures, through training and on-the-job guidance to \nthe remaining line ministries, provincial, and district governments; (ii) improve the organizational \narrangements, operating methodologies, and procedures of the inspection divisions and units in \nline ministries and provincial governments, whose internal audit functions are intended to \nenforce  the  application  of  the  accounting  regulations  and  procedures;  (iii)  extend  the \ncomputerization of the accounting functions and the on-line linkage to the remaining 28 line \nministries and 17 provinces. The TA framework with detailed activities is in Appendix 1, and the \nsummary initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $770,000 equivalent, comprising $414,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $356,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  $620,000 \nequivalent, including all foreign exchange costs and $206,000 equivalent of local currency cost. \n$550,000 of the TA costs will be financed from a grant by the Japan Special Fund funded by the \nGovernment  of  Japan,  and  the  remaining  $70,000  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The \ngovernment  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost  amounting  to  $150,000 \nequivalent. Detailed cost estimates and the proposed financing plan are presented in Appendix \n3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Accounting Department (MOF) will be the Executing Agency of the TA and the \nDepartment  of  Inspection  (MOF)  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  internal  audit \ncomponent. The Accounting Department will provide adequate furnished office facilities for the \nconsultants, counterpart staff, office support, and assistance with minor translation work, and \nwill be responsible for repairs and maintenance of computer hardware and software to be \nprocured under the TA. The Accounting Department will appoint four full-time counterpart staff \nacceptable to ADB and provide for their local transport costs during TA implementation. The \nDepartment of Inspection will provide one full-time counterpart staff and will be responsible for \nhis or her local traveling expenses throughout the duration of the TA. \n \n13.  The TA will require 16 person-months of international and 44 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services, to be served intermittently. The international consultants will include a \ngovernment  accounting  adviser  who  will  also  be  team  leader  (5  person-months)  and  an \naccounting training specialist (11 person-months). The domestic consultants will include a \nsoftware  development  specialist  (24  person-months) and a  training  assistant  and  systems \ntroubleshooter  (20  person-months). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are \npresented in Appendix 4. \n ", "4  \n14.  The  Government  and  the  mission  agree  that  the  individual  consultants  currently \nimplementing  TA  3309  (footnote  1)  should  be  recruited  under  ADB\u2019s  direct  selection5 \nprocedures. This is justified to ensure continuity and consistency, because (i) the consultants \nunder TA 3309 developed and produced the outputs that are to be extended to other line \nministries and provincial governments under the new TA; (ii) the consultants have acquired \nconsiderable knowledge of the sector in Lao PDR and are best placed to continue the work; (iii) \nimplementation will not be adversely affected by a delay in the recruitment process; and (iv) the \nconsultants have performed well. Computers and associated equipment required for the TA will \nbe procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines and Procedures for \nProcurement. \n \n15.  The TA is expected to commence in October 2003 and be implemented over a period of \n36 months. From the date of TA commencement, the consultants will prepare an inception \nreport after 4 weeks, and interim progress reports every 6 months thereafter. A draft final report \nwill be provided 3 months before the end of the TA, for comments by the MOF\u2019s Accounting \nDepartment and ADB. The recommendations of the draft final report will be discussed at a \ntripartite meeting. The final report incorporating the comments of the Government and ADB will \nbe finalized before TA completion. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $620,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  Enhancing  Government \nAccounting Regulations and Procedures Phase II, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2000.
