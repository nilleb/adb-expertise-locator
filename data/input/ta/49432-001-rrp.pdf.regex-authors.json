I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof  up  to  $50,000,000  (or  its  yuan  equivalent)  to  the  CFPA  Microfinance  Management  for \nMicrofinance in Poverty-Stricken Counties in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  After decades of rapid growth, the economy of the PRC has gradually slowed down in \nrecent  years.  In  2015,  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  was  6.9%,  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) estimates that GDP growth will be 6.7% in 2016.2 Strong economic \ngrowth in the PRC lifted more than 600 million people out of poverty over two decades. Poverty \nhad  been  largely  eradicated  in  urban  areas  by  2008,  and  is  now  predominantly  a  rural \nphenomenon. Approximately 13.0% of the rural population in the PRC was living below the \ninternational poverty line in 2012, while only 0.4% of the urban population was classified as \npoor.  There  are  still  592  poverty-stricken  counties  designated  by  the  central  government, \ncovering large rural areas in the central and western regions of the PRC. \n \n3.  In the PRC, rural credit cooperatives (RCCs), with an estimated 70 million individual or \nhousehold borrowers, are the largest providers of small-scale rural credit and currently hold \nabout  6%  of  the  total  banking  industry  assets.  About  70%  of  loans  made  by  RCCs  are \nmicroloans  averaging  less  than  CNY50,000  ($7,692).  The  Postal  Savings  Bank  of  China \n(PSBC) is mandated by the government to develop commercially viable loan products for rural \nenterprises, migrant workers, and farmers. The PSBC has a network of around 40,000 outlets \nand had provided microloans amounting to CNY970 billion by the end of 2014. The average \nPSBC microloan size is about CNY60,000 ($9,231). While rural commercial or cooperative \nbanks also focus on serving micro- and small enterprises, their average loan size of CNY1.2 \nmillion ($184,615) is out of reach for individual borrowers. There has been a large increase in \nthe number of village and township banks since 2006, although their average loan size of more \nthan CNY275,000 ($42,308) places them outside the reach of low-income households. In 2005, \nthe People\u2019s Bank of China designed and tested microcredit companies to further support the \ndevelopment of inclusive finance. The number of microcredit companies has grown rapidly, \nreaching 7,839 by the end of 2013 with outstanding loans of CNY819 billion. However, with an \nestimated average loan size of CNY400,000\u2013CNY600,000 ($61,538\u2013$92,308), most microcredit \ncompanies provide very little real microcredit.  \n \n4.  Despite the rapid growth of the PRC\u2019s finance sector over the past few decades, existing \nfinancial institutions, including banks and microcredit companies, are unable to meet the huge \nmarket  demand  for  microcredit.  According  to  a  survey  carried  out  by  the  Southwestern \nUniversity of Finance and Economics in Chengdu in 2012, informal borrowings by households, \nwhich incur much higher interest rates, amounted to CNY8.6 trillion, of which 35% were used for \nagriculture and business. An analysis of county-level lending and deposit-taking data between \n2006 and 2012 suggests that 45% of the rural population is underserved with credit, and that \n20% of higher-income rural households absorb more than 54% of formal borrowings. Overall, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. In the PRC, county refers to a local administrative division \ncovering part of the rural areas of a prefecture-level city. Poverty-stricken counties are determined based on the \nnumber of people in extreme poverty, the number of low-income people, the per capita income of rural residents, \nper capita GDP, and per capita fiscal revenue of the local government.  \n2  ADB. 2015. Asian Development Outlook 2015 Supplement: Growth Holds Its Own in Developing Asia. Manila. \n ", "2 \nthere is an unmet demand of CNY1.3 trillion\u2013CNY2.3 trillion for formal credit from 10 million\u201317 \nmillion households and microenterprises. This is in addition to the 41 million\u201348 million rural \nhouseholds  that  would  still  need  to  access  informal  credit  with  an  average  loan  size  of \nCNY36,000 ($5,538). While 78.9% of the population in the PRC had access to bank accounts in \n2015, the ratio was lower for the rural population (74.3%) and women (74.3%).3 Women in rural \nareas perform most of the agriculture work, and they are often marginalized because of lower \neducation and the lack of access to skills and information. Laws on land management and rural \nland contracting have been put in place to promote gender equality in land rights, but women\u2019s \nrights to land remain limited.4 A 2011 survey showed that only 17.1% of existing contracts and \n38.2% of existing certificates include women\u2019s names.5 \n \n5.  The CFPA Microfinance Management (CFPAMM) was identified by ADB as a strong \npartner to provide microcredit to rural households and individuals in poverty-stricken counties in \nthe PRC. The company has a long and successful track record in providing collateral-free \nmicroloans to rural women and microentrepreneurs. It has strong shareholders, good corporate \ngovernance, an experienced management team, advanced risk management systems, and \nsatisfactory financial performance. It has experienced rapid growth since 2012 and has plans for \nsignificant further expansion. The long-term ADB finance will provide the much-needed funding \nto support its growth, which in turn will improve access to finance of the underserved segment in \nthe PRC, particularly women in rural areas. The proposed project is ADB\u2019s first private sector \nloan in microfinance in the PRC. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n6.  The CFPAMM was established in 2008 to manage the microfinance activities of the \nChina Foundation for Poverty Alleviation (CFPA) under a joint program of the World Bank and \nthe Government of the PRC that had been in operation since 1996. The CFPAMM is currently \none of the largest microfinance institutions in the PRC in terms of branch network, loan portfolio, \nand number of active borrowers. From its establishment to 31 December 2015, it disbursed \nmore than 1.26 million loans totaling CNY12.6 billion. [The rest of this paragraph has been \nredacted due to commercially sensitive information.] \n \n7.  The CFPAMM is a commercial microfinance institution dedicated to promoting financial \ninclusion in the PRC. Its business model is aligned with a social enterprise, focusing on offering \nmicroloans to borrowers in a wide geographic segment of poverty-stricken counties and in \nregions in the PRC that are underdeveloped or affected by natural disaster. It primarily targets \nunderserved rural women clients, most of whom are excluded from access to formal financial \nservices. Most microloans are for agricultural and farming purposes, while the rest are for \nindividual microbusinesses in trade, handicraft manufacturing, and services.6 [The rest of this \nparagraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.]   \n \n8.  In 2014, the average loan size offered by the CFPAMM was CNY11,332 ($1,743), and \n69% of loans were for less than CNY10,000 ($1,538). About 63% of loans were used for \nagricultural and farming purposes. The vast majority of its clients are rural households (97%) \nwith  women  as  direct  borrowers  (94%).  In  this  segment,  the  CFPAMM  faces  only  limited \n                                                \n3  World Bank. 2015. The Little Data Book on Financial Inclusion 2015.

", "  3 \ncompetition from the PSBC and RCCs. Its main competitive advantage is its superior service \nquality. With more than 1,500 loan officers, all locally recruited, the company provides the \u201clast \nmile\u201d of financial services to remote areas. The loan application, contract signing, disbursement, \nand collection all transpire at the place of the borrowers. The company has a very quick \ndecision-making process and 86% of the clients receive their loans within 7 days of application. \nBased on the company\u2019s 2014 client satisfaction survey, 96% of the borrowers were satisfied \nwith the efficiency of its services.  \n \n9.  [This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.] \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n10.  Ownership. The CFPAMM is majority owned by the CFPA (62.7%), a PRC-based NGO \nwith a close relationship with the government. The CFPA was established in 1989 by various \nretired senior government officials, and is currently the largest NGO working in the field of \npoverty reduction in the PRC. It is supervised by the State Council Leading Group Office of \nPoverty Alleviation and Development. Currently, 13 out of 15 members of the governing council, \nincluding the chair and executive vice-chair, are volunteers. None of the previous or current \ngoverning council members have beneficial ownership interest in the foundation. The other two \nshareholders are the International Finance Corporation (IFC), holding 19.2%; and a corporation \nfrom Hong Kong, China fully owned by Sequoia Capital China Fund, a PRC-focused private \nequity fund registered in Cayman Islands and managed by Neil Nanpeng Shen, managing \npartner of Sequoia Capital China (holding 18.1%). \n \n11.  Management.  CFPAMM\u2019s  senior  management  team  is  composed  of  the  general \nmanager, four deputy general managers (chief operations officer, chief financial officer, chief \nbranding officer, and chief risk management officer), and an assistant general manager (the \ninformation technology [IT] manager).

ADB will provide a senior secured term loan to the CFPAMM of up to $50 million (or its \nyuan equivalent) with up to a 5-year tenor. The proposed loan will fund CFPAMM\u2019s microfinance \noperations in counties designated by central and local governments as poverty-stricken areas. \nThe subloans will be primarily used for agricultural and farming purposes, and may also be used \nto support individual microbusinesses in trade, manufacturing, and services as well as other \nrural economic activities. The proposed loan will benefit women, as the CFPAMM specifically \ntargets women in rural areas as its core customers and women currently represent 94% of \nCFPAMM\u2019s borrowers. It will promote gender equity by improving rural women\u2019s access to \nfinance through 121,000 collateral-free microloans to women borrowers.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  Legal documentation. The proposed loan will be governed by a loan facility agreement, \nwhich will contain terms customary for a loan of this nature and amount.  \n \n20.  Monitoring. Monitoring of the project will be undertaken by ADB. The CFPAMM will \nprovide  ADB  with  financial  and  other  reports  at  predetermined  regular  intervals  and  as \nrequested. These reports will include (i) semiannual unaudited financial statements; (ii) annual \naudited financial statements; (iii) annual compliance certificates for financial covenants; (iv) \nannual  reports  on  the  subloan  portfolio;  and  (v)  annual  reporting  to  include  selected \ndevelopment indicators agreed on by ADB and the borrower, and confirmation on compliance \nwith national laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), Social Protection \nStrategy, and gender action plan implementation.7 \n \n21.  Evaluation. Pursuant to ADB Operations Manual, monitoring reports will be prepared \nand submitted to ADB regularly and at least annually.8 The first such report will be submitted no \nlater than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s loan to the CFPAMM will add value by helping to achieve the following: \n(i)  Provide long-term finance to CFPAMM. As a nonbank financial institution, the \nCFPAMM does not have access to deposits and relies entirely on wholesale \nfunding  to  support  its  operations.  [The  sentence  has  been  redacted  due  to \ncommercially sensitive information.]  It will reduce CFPAMM\u2019s funding risk and \nenable the company to develop a long-term business plan with more funding \ncertainty.  ADB\u2019s  loan  has  a  longer  tenor  compared  to  the  company\u2019s \nmicrofinance products and, as a result, the ADB loan can be rolled over several \ntimes, thereby maximizing development impact.  \n(ii)  Support finance sector development. Microfinance in the PRC is still in the \nearly stage of development, and there is vast unmet demand for microcredit from \nthe rural population. The proposed loan will support the development of one of \nthe few microfinance institutions that focuses on providing real microcredit in \nrural areas, thus contributing to the development of this underdeveloped sector.  \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2003.

The project has gender-specific loan targets \nand is expected to directly benefit at least 121,000 women borrowers. A gender \naction plan has been prepared to support the gender equity theme classification \nof the project. This includes gender measures to improve women\u2019s financial \nplanning and literacy, other skills, and awareness of consumer protection issues.  \n \nD.  Risks \n \n23.  Key risks include the following: [The rest of this paragraph has been redacted due to \ncommercially sensitive information.] \n \n24.  [This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.] \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n25.  Impact. The project\u2019s impact will be enhanced financial inclusion of rural households \nand improved access to finance for microentrepreneurs in poverty-stricken and underdeveloped \nregions, thus contributing to economic development and poverty reduction. ADB\u2019s funding will \nenable  the  CFPAMM  to  scale  up  its  business,  reach  significantly  underserved  customer \nsegments, and provide urgently needed microcredit to rural households for improving livelihood \nand poverty alleviation. \n \n26.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be sustainable growth of CFPAMM\u2019s microfinance \noperations in poverty-stricken counties designated by central and local governments, as well as \ncounties in regions that are underdeveloped or affected by natural disaster. This will help boost \nincome opportunities and reduce poverty in the target regions.   \n \n27.  Output. The output will be the expansion of CFPAMM\u2019s microfinance lending to rural \nhouseholds and microentrepreneurs in poverty-stricken counties. Based on the historical profile \nof  CFPAMM\u2019s  microloans,  the  proposed  ADB  loan  is  expected  to  benefit  about  129,000 \nmicroloan borrowers, of which 125,000 are expected to be rural households, 121,000 will be \nwomen borrowers, and 104,000 will be borrowers with no access to financial institutions other \nthan the CFPAMM. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n28.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The project supports two \npriorities identified by the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: (i) poverty reduction and inclusive \neconomic growth, and (ii) private sector development and operations.9 The midterm review \nhighlights ADB\u2019s focus on reducing vulnerability and inequality and promoting inclusive growth \nin middle-income countries. It is consistent with the country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nthe PRC10 and the country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for the PRC, which prioritizes \npromoting balanced development of rural and urban areas, supporting catalytic nonsovereign \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2014.

Consistency with the sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The proposed \nproject is aligned with ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan, which notes that ADB will \nsupport broad-based household access to microfinance.13 ADB\u2019s Microfinance Development \nStrategy  calls  for  tapping  the  increasing  potential  of  the  poor  by  expanding  access  to \nmicrofinance.14 ADB\u2019s enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy also states that ADB seeks to \npromote sound and efficient financial markets to improve access to finance and achieve pro-\npoor  growth.15 The  proposed  project  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  earlier  support  in  the \nmicrofinance sector.16 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n30.  The proposed loan is classified category FI (treated as C) for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples impacts following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The loan will fund CFPAMM\u2019s microfinance operations in counties designated by central \nand local governments as poverty-stricken areas. In particular, the subloans will be provided to \nwomen, under a joint liability model, with a maximum limit currently set at CNY16,000 per \nborrower. The majority of the subloans will be provided to rural households for agribusiness \n(e.g., livestock, fish, and crop farming) and microentrepreneurial purposes related to trade, \nhandicraft manufacturing,  and  services.17 The  subloans  under  the  proposed  ADB  loan  are \nexpected to have minimal environmental and social impacts. No land acquisition, physical or \neconomic displacements, or impact on indigenous peoples communities is foreseen in relation \nto  any  activities  of  the  subborrowers.  The  CFPAMM  will  apply  the  Prohibited  Investment \nActivities List in Annex 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement and comply with the relevant \nnational laws, standards, and regulations. The project will exclude all individual subloans (which \ncurrently have a maximum limit of CNY50,000) and all subloans that are classified category A or \nB for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The CFPAMM will monitor \nand  provide  information  on  its  compliance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  with \nrelevant national laws, standards, and guidelines in its annual report. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s loan is categorized as having a gender equity theme as it will support CFPAMM\u2019s \ngroup lending portfolio, which primarily provides microloans to groups of women in rural areas. It \nis expected that under ADB\u2019s loan facility, the CFPAMM will provide microloans to 129,000 \nclients  of  which  94%  will  be  women.  Measures  to  further  empower  and  benefit  women \nborrowers and staff have been identified and will be incorporated in the project design, including \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2015.

With the small available loan size, the \namount of pesticides that will be acquired is relatively low. In addition, to ensure that women farmers have minimal \nexposure to pesticides, under the gender action plan the project will include training on proper pesticides handling, \nstorage, and disposal that is aligned with integrated pest management approaches. ", "  7 \n(i) induction trainings for all women borrowers; (ii) formal and informal trainings (e.g., financial \nliteracy, farming techniques, integrated pest management approaches,18 and handicrafts) to \nenhance skills and capacity of women borrowers; (iii) development of networks of women \nentrepreneurs to facilitate knowledge exchange; and (iv) annual trainings for CFPAMM loan \nofficers  and  other  staff  to  better  understand  the  special  needs  of  women  borrowers.  The \nCFPAMM will also enhance its data collection to track and monitor information on women \nborrowers as well as refine its client satisfaction survey to increase focus on the experience of \nwomen borrowers. The CFPAMM will comply with national labor laws and will take measures to \ncomply with internationally recognized core labor standards in accordance with ADB\u2019s Social \nProtection strategy (footnote 14).  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n32.  The CFPAMM was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n33.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n34.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 19  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of the PRC has no objection to the proposed assistance to the CFPAMM.
