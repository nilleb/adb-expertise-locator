INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to support India\u2019s biofuel \ndevelopment  using  novel  technology  and  sustainable  business  structures.  Biofuels  are  a \nrenewable energy source from organic matter, agricultural waste, and municipal solid waste \n(MSW). They can be used in energy, transport, manufacturing, and medicine in the form of \nbioethanol, biogas, and biodiesel. Especially, biofuels can be blended into low-carbon fuels for \nvehicles and treated as a key tool for green transportation. The TA will focus on advanced biofuels \nand  will  enable  the  preparation  of  specific  development  schemes  with  technical,  financial, \ncontractual,  and  capacity  development  arrangements;  and  viable  business  and  operational \nmodels.1 \n \n2.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  four  operational  priorities  of  Strategy  2030  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).2 The TA is included in ADB's country operations business plan, 2021\u2013\n2023 for India.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  India is highly reliant on fuel imports, raising concerns about the country\u2019s energy security \nand economic and financial deficits. Imported fuels account for 85% of crude oil, 75% of liquefied \npetroleum gas, and 50% of liquefied natural gas on a consumption basis.  Such fuels are used in \nindustries, power generation, transportation, and cooking. Demand for nonfossil fuels is growing \nin India as well. For example, ethanol consumption has been outpacing domestic production for \nindustrial chemicals, fuels, and beverages, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \nhas highlighted the serious shortage of ethanol for disinfectants. India is the world\u2019s third-largest \nenergy consumer despite lower per capita energy consumption than other major economies. \nTherefore, it is projected to continuously drive fuel demand across wide-ranging sectors. This will \nrequire more fuel imports to meet rapid growth in the economy and motorization. India\u2019s import \nbill for fuels has already inflated significantly. Considering price fluctuation risks on fuel imports, \nit is important to promote alternative fuels that can be produced from domestic resources. \n \n4.  India experiences health hazards from severe air and water pollution, which is caused \npartly by burning crops and dumping waste in water. Crop burning after harvesting is one of the \nbiggest causes of severe air pollution in major cities.4 New Delhi\u2019s air quality worsens during post-\nharvest burning of crop residue in the fall and winter seasons. The capital was among 13 Indian \ncities in the 20 most polluted cities in the world.5 Poor solid waste management is also a major \nconcern in India\u2019s urban areas because of methane gas emissions from landfills and water \ncontamination. Since advanced biofuels are produced from agricultural and biomass residue, \nMSW, and used cooking oil, increasing their use may promote waste recycling and have a \n \n1  There are two generations of biofuels. First-generation biofuels come from surplus food crops, such as sugar, wheat \nstraw, or vegetable oil. Second-generation biofuels, or advanced biofuels, come from nonfood biomass, such as \nagricultural residue, MSW, and nonfood energy crops grown on land unsuitable for crop production (such as \nbamboo). \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. The TA will support (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in \ngender equality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability; and (iv) strengthening governance and institutional capacity. \n3  ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2021\u20132023. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 July 2020. \n4  Other contributors include vehicular pollution, industrial emissions, thermal power plants, construction dust, waste \nburning, and household use of cheap and dirty fuels. \n5  World Health Organization (WHO). 2018. WHO Global Ambient Air Quality Database (update 2018). Geneva. \n ", "2 \nsignificant positive environmental impact by alleviating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions6, \nand reducing dumping of waste in water and landfills. \n \n5.  India is well-positioned to advance biofuels in terms of demand and supply capacity. More \nthan half of India\u2019s land is agricultural and produces a massive amount of crop residue.7 India \ngenerates about 62 million tons of MSW annually, and while 68% of annual MSW is collected, \nonly 28% is processed or treated. As a result, about 80% of MSW is disposed in landfills or open \ndumps. The generation of MSW has been increasing at a high rate as urban areas expand. More \nMSW should be collected and recycled into valuable fuels. In rural areas, if agricultural waste can \nalso be collected effectively as feedstock for biofuels, its sales will be able to supplement rural \nfarmers\u2019 income and negate the need to burn crop waste. Thus, advanced biofuels can be \nproduced  locally  and  will  not  harm  food  security  because  of  feedstock  from  waste  unlike \nconventional biofuels produced from food. These can serve as a substitute for fossil fuels and \nreduce carbon emissions. Bioethanol and biodiesel can be blended in petrol and conventional \ndiesel; bio-compressed natural gas (bio-CNG) can fuel gas-based vehicles (e.g., taxis, buses, \nand three-wheelers); and biogas can be used for cooking and power generation. \n \n6.  India faces technical and financial barriers in commercially producing biofuels. Despite \nstrong demand and potential, India lags other countries in terms of biofuel production. The United \nStates and Brazil are the largest biofuel producers, accounting for more than 70% of global \nproduction; India\u2019s production accounts for only 1%. Major constraints include (i) the absence of \ntechnology standards for biofuel commercial production, (ii) high biofuel production costs and \nfinancial viability risks, (iii) no feedstock supply chain mechanisms, (iv) no suitable pricing \nadjustment mechanisms, and (v) limited awareness about biofuels among farmers and local \ncommunities. These barriers have discouraged private investments and commercial financing in \nscaling up production and business. \n \n7.  To overcome the development barriers and enable the domestic biofuel market, the \ngovernment approved the National Policy on Biofuels in 2018. The government outlined measures \nto improve biofuel production, set up biorefineries, develop new feedstock for biofuels, bring new \ntechnology for biofuel conversion, facilitate biofuel blends with conventional transport fuels, and \ncreate an enabling environment for domestic biofuel deployment.8 The policy mandates that \nbiofuels should be distributed and off-taken by public oil and gas companies, which have been \nrequested to set up biorefineries with advanced technology to demonstrate their technology and \ncommercial viability.9 \n \n \n6  75% of India\u2019s overall energy consumption is sourced from fossil fuels (Enerdata. 2020. Country Energy Report\u2013\nIndia. Grenoble). The biofuels are expected to help India improve climate change mitigation as well as energy \nsecurity. \n7  More than 70% of crop residue is from cereal crops. Farmers use some crop residue for animal feeds and mulch but \nburn most of it. \n8  The policy targets blending 20.0% ethanol in petrol and 5.0% biodiesel in diesel by 2030. The baseline percentage \nof these transport fuels stood at about 2.0% for petrol and less than 0.1% for diesel. \n9  These include the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), the \nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and GAIL (India) Limited. \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA\u2019s impact will be increased use of domestic biofuels in energy and transportation, \nas aligned with the National Policy on Biofuels. The outcome will be enhanced readiness for \ninvestments in biofuel development and business.10 \n \n9.  The TA will take a cross-sector approach to tackle various thematic issues, such as energy \nsecurity, transport mobility, agribusiness, financial stability, air and water pollution, waste disposal, \npublic health, climate change, and the urban\u2013rural divide. The advanced biofuel market will \nprovide opportunities to mitigate global warming, harness agricultural waste and MSW, create \nindustries and jobs, and strengthen energy independence. This development is expected to have \na transformational effect on the domestic economy and society as well as on regional cooperation \nthrough knowledge transfers to neighboring countries.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  The TA has four outputs on developing bioethanol, bio-CNG, and biodiesel plants; and \nadopting gender mainstreaming in the feedstock supply chains. The TA will finance studies and \nprovide support to improve readiness for the investments. \n \n11.  Output 1: Development schemes for bioethanol demonstration plants prepared. In \n2019, the government approved the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, a development plan to \nfinance advanced bioethanol projects. The government has identified 12 bioethanol plants for \ndemonstration purposes,12 and investments of $1.7 billion\u2013$2.0 billion will be required. The Indian \nOil Corporation Limited (IOCL) plans to develop the first pilot bioethanol project using nonfood \nbiomass, mainly rice straw and other lignocellulosic feedstock, and scale up a subsequent project \nthrough a learning-and-doing approach. IOCL also intends to develop bio-CNG, waste-to-energy \npower generation, and plastic recycling plants on a pilot basis.13 The Hindustan Petroleum \nCorporation Limited (HPCL) has different project schemes in other locations. The TA will support \nat least two bioethanol plants. \n \n12.  Output 2: Development schemes for bio-compressed natural gas demonstration \nplants  prepared.  In  2018,  the  government  launched  the  Sustainable  Alternative  Towards \nAffordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative to promote about $25 billion of investments in 5,000 \nbio-CNG plants. As of October 2020, more than 500 expressions of interest were received from \nenergy companies and other private firms and entrepreneurs,14 which are expected to have \nfinancing arrangements under the SATAT initiative with the Oil Industry Development Board \n(OIDB) and/or public financial institutions, such as the Indian Renewable Energy Development \n \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 ADB. 2018. Technical Assistance for South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Regional Energy Cooperation. \nManila. Biofuel development is a knowledge sharing area under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation. \n12 The plants\u2019 initial locations are (i) Haryana, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh for IOCL; (ii) Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, \nand Uttar Pradesh for HPCL; (iii) Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Odisha for BPCL; (iv) Karnataka for Mangalore \nRefinery and Petrochemicals Limited; and (v) Assam for Numaligarh Refinery Limited, which is owned by BPCL, \nIOCL, and the Government of Assam. Numaligarh is implementing its plant, and IOCL\u2019s Haryana plant is at an \nadvance stage of development. All plants are expected to use different types of feedstock suitable to each location\u2019s \navailable resources, and their development stages are varied. \n13 Output 1 included these pilot projects because they are integral to IOCL\u2019s components. \n14 IOCL also plans a bio-CNG plant to produce compressed natural gas from press mud, which is residual matter in the \nfiltration process of sugarcane juice. \n ", "4 \nAgency (IREDA) and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Bio-\nCNG is supposed to be off-taken by public oil marketing companies and transported through their \nfuel station networks. Instead of liquefied petroleum gas, biogas can be distributed or cylindered \nfor cooking in urban and rural areas. The TA will support at least 10 bio-CNG plants. \n \n13.  Output 3: Development schemes for biodiesel demonstration plants prepared. In \n2019, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) initiated the Repurpose Used \nCooking Oil (RUCO) initiative to collect and convert used cooking oil to biodiesel.15 The RUCO \ninitiative  enabled  authorized  developers  to  collect  and  transfer  inedible  cooking  oil  from \ninstitutional and individual users to biodiesel refinery plants. Oil marketing companies launched a \nprogram to collect used cooking oil in 200 cities, and 56 companies have been identified to \nprocure used cooking oil.16 Public oil marketing companies have expressed interest to procure \nsuch biodiesel from energy companies and other private firms and entrepreneurs, which are \nexpected to have financing arrangements with OIDB and/or public financial institutions in similar \narrangements with the SATAT initiative. The TA will support at least six biodiesel plants. \n \n14.  Output 4: Gender mainstreaming design for the biofuel value chain incorporated. In \nIndia, more than 80% of rural women work in agriculture,17 and many female waste pickers handle \nmunicipal waste disposal and recycling activities. Hiring these women to collect and segregate \nfeedstock for biofuel and perform other related activities will increase their income-earning \npotential. Such opportunities will help empower rural and urban poor women and reduce gender \nand social disparities. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and establish women\u2019s equitable access \nand engagement in biofuel feedstock supply chains, including feedstock production, collection, \nstorage, and related business marketing (e.g., income generation from selling biogas byproducts, \nsuch as organic fertilizers). These benefits can be resonated on a local level in organizing a \nwomen\u2019s support network at the demonstration plant sites, where awareness campaigns and \ntraining and job programs can be conducted in partnership with civil society and/or public and \nprivate parties.18 The programs are expected to have at least 100 female participants. \n \n15.  Key methods and activities with ADB value addition. The development schemes in \noutputs  1\u20133  will  be  based  on  engineering  studies,  safeguard  plans,  financing  plans,  and \nimplementation arrangements for the biofuel plants that will be supported under the TA. Six major \nactivities will support their implementation. First, it is crucial to assess and select the most suitable \nhigh technology to convert various feedstocks to biofuel. The technical design will be reviewed \nand improved in terms of processing efficiency and based on a feedstock cost-and-benefit \nanalysis. Given the number of commercial biorefineries in the world,19 international best practices \n \n15 FSSAI is the food regulator, which intends to prevent consumers from reusing toxic and hazardous cooking oil, \ndisposing them into drains, and polluting sewage and waterways. \n16 For example, McDonald\u2019s has already started converting used cooking oil to biodiesel in 100 outlets in India. \n17 In India, 85% of rural women are engaged in agriculture, and it is estimated that agriculture employs almost 80% of \n\u201ceconomically active women\u201d (National Rural Livelihoods Missions. 2015. Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana \nAgriculture Guidelines. p. 1). \n18 While cases in other countries have shown the benefits of employing women in bioenergy processing, they also \nraised concerns that women are at a disadvantage when it came to wages, working conditions and benefits, training, \nsafety, and health risks. Creating best practices in promoting gender sensitivity is critical to minimize risks and \nmaximize opportunities. \n19 At least 12 lignocellulosic refineries operate commercially (excluding those with annual capacity of less than 10 \nmillion liters) in Brazil, Europe, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the United States (International Renewable \nEnergy Agency. 2019. Advanced Biofuels: What Holds Them Back? Abu Dhabi). Bio-CNG plants also operate in \nBrazil, Finland, and the United States. Plants that generate biogas from food waste, manure, and sewage from \nwastewater treatment operate across the world. Similar plants that refine biodiesel from used cooking oils operate in \nBrazil, Germany, Netherlands, and the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n ", "5 \nwill be assessed with ADB and development partners for knowledge sharing.20 Second, catalytic \nfinancing avenues and schemes will be studied to make biofuel demonstration projects financially \nviable. Advanced biofuel investments are capital-intensive and involve large risks, such as \ntechnology selection, feedstock availability, and the resultant financial viability gap. To break entry \nbarriers and help demonstrate pilot implementation,21 public sector finance will initially be driven \nto improve the investment climate and catalyze subsequent public\u2013private partnerships and \nprivate investments, subject to due diligence studies. Third, it is essential to establish effective \nbusiness models and efficient feedstock supply chain mechanisms (e.g., collection, storage, and \ntransport methods; and their contractors). Biofuel feedstocks should be available sustainably. \nThey are highly local by nature and managed through tailored supply contracts with local \nindustries, municipalities, farmers, and private parties. Fuel offtake contracts should also be \ndeveloped to ensure business sustainability. Fourth, relevant regulatory frameworks will be \nreviewed to assess if possible incentives, requirements, and standards are practicable. Proper \npricing  and  transaction  systems  also  need  to  be  established.  Fifth,  all  stakeholders  and \nbeneficiaries  should  be  properly  engaged  in  value  chain  development.  The  schemes  will \nincorporate the effective gender mainstreaming practices in output 4. Stakeholder awareness and \ncapacity will be improved through workshops, consultations, and partnerships with civil society to \nensure inclusiveness and safeguard mitigations. Last, holistic development road maps and \nstrategies will be prepared for biofuel network expansion. The road maps and strategies will have \ntechnical, economic, human resource, social, and environmental aspects to meet policy targets. \nThe TA will provide phased support for knowledge and capacity enhancement and follow-on \nfinancial transactions, subject to financing due diligence during implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.5 million, of which (i) $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund22 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, \nand (ii) $0.5 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and \nKnowledge Partnership Fund, both to be administered by ADB.23 The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. The executing and/or implementing agencies will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, logistics and administration support, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA. The executing agency will be the Ministry of Petroleum and \nNatural Gas.24 The implementing agencies will be IOCL, HPCL, OIDB, IREDA, and NABARD.25 \nThe relevant government authorities are the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare, the \n \n20 Development partners are expected to include the Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute and the \nNew Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization. The TA will focus on successes and failures of \ndeveloped and developing countries as well as lessons on policy, market pricing mechanisms, and technology. The \nknowledge product will be disseminated. \n21 The biofuel policy envisages incentive schemes, including tax credits, advance depreciation, differential pricing from \nfirst-generation biofuels, and viability gap funding. To reduce financial and commercial risks of biofuel investments, \nthe policy mandated public oil marketing companies to provide offtake guarantees to purchase biofuels. \n22 Established by the Government of Japan. \n23 TA implementation will follow each fund\u2019s specific requirements, including eligibility criteria for funding and monitoring \nand reporting requirements. \n24 The executing agency\u2019s project management office (PMO) will be set up at IOCL to liaise with ADB, consultants, and \nimplementing agencies. The PMO will also coordinate procedural matters with these parties to support the executing \nagency. \n25 IOCL and HPCL will handle output 1, while all implementing agencies will handle outputs 2\u20134. \n ", "6 \nMinistry of New and Renewable Energy, and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.26 \nImplementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation perioda  January 2021\u2013June 2023 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas \nImplementing agencies  Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation \nLimited, Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, National \nBank for Agriculture and Rural Development, and Oil Industry \nDevelopment Board \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: QCBS (quality\u2013cost  International expertise  $1.15 millionb \nratio of 90:10)  (29 person-months) \nIndividual: individual  International expertise  $1.13 millionc \nselection  (27 person-months) \nNational expertise \n(3 person-months) \nDisbursement  Disbursement of TA resources will follow ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nArrangements for disbursement from multiple funding sources (e.g., \nfront-loading ADB-administered funds, cost sharing, or pro rata) will \nfollow each trust fund\u2019s implementation guidelines and agreed with the \ncofinanciers. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TA = technical assistance. \na  The implementation period starts from the expected month of commitment or signing. \nb  Includes remuneration and per diem, travel, reports and communications, miscellaneous administration and support \ncosts, and contingencies (3.5% of other costs). \nc  Includes remuneration and per diem, travel, and contingencies (3.5% of other costs). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.
