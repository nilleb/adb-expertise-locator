The 2007 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) made \nprovision  for  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  to  continue1 supporting  the \ndevelopment of the water supply and sanitation sector in small towns in Nepal.2 ADB\u2019s PPTA \nFact-Finding  Mission  visited  Nepal  from  10  to  17  May  2007  and  reached  a  preliminary \nunderstanding with the Government of Nepal (the Government) on the goals, purpose, scope, \nimplementation, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the PPTA. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Meeting  the  Millennium  Development  Goals. Continuing efforts on the part of the \nGovernment have raised living standards, but the country remains one of the poorest in the \nregion, with human development indicators that are among the lowest in the world. Inhabitants of \nmountain areas have been shown to be poorer than those in the terai4 and hills across a wide \nrange of social indicators, and Far Western and Mid Western regions display lower values for \nhuman development indicators than other parts of the country. Similarly, while daily availability of \ndrinking  water  has  increased  significantly,  discrepancies  among  regions  remain  significant.5 \nNepal is fully committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Tenth Plan \n(2002\u20132007), which reflects the country\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), helped \ninitiate national efforts towards attaining the MDGs; the Interim Three-Year Plan (2008\u20132010), \ncurrently under preparation, is expected to consolidate this endeavor. The recent MDG progress \nreview6 has indicated that progress remains insufficient, particularly with respect to sanitation, \nand several activities need to be expanded if MDG targets are to be attained by 2015. While data \nvaries depending on the sources, water supply coverage has increased nationwide from 46% in \n1990 to about 75% in 2005; this value is in line with the projected 2007 MDG target. Progress in \nsanitation has also been significant as the proportion of population with sustainable access to \nimproved sanitation increased from 6% in 1990 to about 40% in 2005; 7 this value, remains \nsubstantially below the projected 2015 MDG target of 53%.8 \n \n3.  Water and Sanitation. Overall, Nepal has abundant water resources,9 but population and \ndevelopment pressures, competing uses, and in some cases, poor water resource management \nserve to compromise quantity, quality and therefore access; some major towns and cities in the \nhilly areas face acute shortages during dry periods of the year. Groundwater is abundant in the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Manila (Loan 1755-NEP, \napproved on 12 September 2000, is expected to close on 20 September 2008). \n2  As reflected in ADB. 2007.Country Operations Business Plan (2008\u20132010) for Nepal. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 May 2007.  \n4   The terai is the flat southern region of Nepal. Part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, it stretches from east to west, occupies \nabout 17% of the land area, and is home to almost 50% of Nepal\u2019s population. \n5  While the amount of drinking water available in Nepal overall has tripled, from 58 mega liters (ml) (1994/95) to 159 ml \n(2003/04), areas such as the Mid-Western and Far Western regions barely doubled their capacity over the same \nperiod (National Planning Commission. 2005. Statistical Year Book: Chapter 11.1. Kathmandu).  \n6  National Planning Commission of the Government of Nepal and United Nations Development Programme. 2006. \nMillennium Development Goals: Needs Assessment for Nepal. Kathmandu.  \n7  In rural areas, access to improved water sources increased from 43% in 1990 to 79% in 2005; this figure increased \nfrom 90% to 93% in urban areas. Access to improved sanitation in rural areas increased from 3% in 1990 to 30% in \n2005; in urban areas this proportion increased from 34% to 81% over the same period (Source: HMG/UNDP 2005). \n8  According to this report, projected public investment needed in the drinking water supply and sanitation sector for the \n2005\u20132015 period is around NRs138 billion; the financing gap would be on the order of NRs89 billion.  \n9  High rainfall totals generally give rise to abundant water supplies, at least seasonally, and surface water and \ngroundwater are both important sources for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. \n ", "2   \naquifers  of  the  terai,  yet  more  limited  in  the  populated  hill  regions  because  of  the  lower \npermeability  of  the  soils.  Many  Nepalese  use  surface  water\u2014which  is  most  vulnerable  to \npollution\u2014for their potable water supply.  \n \n4.  Improvements  in  water  quality  have  unfortunately  not  been  matched  by  progress  in \nadopting sustainable sanitation solutions and achieving necessary coverage. Throughout the \ncountry, as water becomes readily available, pour-flush systems are rapidly replacing crude dry \ntoilets.  With  the  progressive  adoption  of  septic  tanks  and  onsite  sanitation,  groundwater \nresources, particularly around urbanized centers, are at risk of bacterial contamination caused by \neffluent leakage and pollutant migration from poorly constructed and maintained pit latrines, and \neffluent from septic tanks and other disposal facilities.10 In municipal areas where drainage is \npresent, households often discharge sewage to drains, either directly or through septic tanks; this \ncan result in health hazards during the monsoon season when drains overflow. Surface water \nquality has seriously deteriorated as a result of poor wastewater management. Municipal areas \noutside of Kathmandu Valley lack access to a sewerage network or sewage treatment facilities, \nwith virtually all domestic and industrial wastewater being ultimately discharged into the rivers.11 \nWhile plentiful flow during the rainy season may dilute pollutant concentrations and thus limit the \nimpact on downstream populations that obtain drinking water from the same source, the effect of \nwastewater discharges into rivers can be significant during the dry season. Shallow groundwaters \nare  also  at  risk  from  contamination:  pathogenic  bacteria,  pesticides,  nitrates  and  industrial \neffluents (in urban and periurban areas) are likely to be the greatest problems encountered.12 \nDeep groundwaters present in the Kathmandu Valley and the terai are also largely anaerobic and \nvulnerable to increased concentrations of iron, manganese, ammonium and possibly arsenic.13 \n \n5.  Policy,  Regulations,  and  Institutions.  The  Government\u2019s  long-term  program  as \nreflected in the National Water Plan (2002\u20132027), seeks to meet increasing demand, and sets \ntargets to provide water supply and sanitation for all by 2017. Within the context of the Ninth Plan, \nthe Government approved the National Water Supply and Sanitation Policy in April 1998. While a \nspecific Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Strategy for Nepal was approved in 2004, \npolicies for water supply and sanitation in the urban sector remain largely unaddressed.14 In \nJanuary 2000, the Government also approved its 15-Year Development Plan, which identified \nsupport for 209 priority small towns.15 A review of this plan, however, reveals that (i) the situation \nthroughout the country has significantly changed since its approval, and (ii) many of the priorities \nhighlighted in the plan have already been achieved, either by the Government, other donors or \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), indicating the need for development of a new medium-\nterm development plan for the sector. The Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) is \nalso formulating an umbrella Drinking Water Act. 16  \n                                                 \n10  The adequacy of onsite sanitation is dependent on the type of soils, geological characteristics, and water table level.  \n11  Access to sewerage facilities is limited to about 15% of the houses, even in valley towns. No area of the country \napart from a portion of Kathmandu Valley is supported by wastewater treatment services (the valley\u2019s total treatment \ncapacity is designed to be 34.4 ML/day). Within Kathmandu Valley, only one (Guhyeswari) of the five existing \ntreatment plants is reported to be adequately functioning. While the technology (aerated lagoons, oxidation ditch, and \nstabilization ponds) appears adequate and relatively simple, the systems operate inefficiently or are out of order. \n12  National Planning Commission. 2005. Statistical Year Book: Chapter 16.1. Kathmandu.  \n13  British Geological Survey and WaterAid Nepal. 2001.Groundwater Quality: Nepal. Kathmandu. \n14 With support from the Government of Japan, the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage has initiated the \nformulation of such policy, but it has not been completed or approved. The main policy thrusts include (i) full water \nsupply and sanitation coverage, (ii) outlining roles and responsibilities for sector stakeholders, (iii) water source \nprotection and management, and (iv) NGO and private sector participation. The draft policy devolves the planning, \nimplementation and operations and maintenance functions of water supply and sanitation services to local bodies.    \n15  Based on the plan, 29 town projects were developed and will be completed under the ongoing ADB loan (footnote 1). \n16  A comprehensive assessment and discussion of water-related laws in Nepal was prepared by WaterAid (WaterAid. \n2005. Water Laws in Nepal. Kathmandu). Areas that may need strengthening include: (i) discharge quality standards; \n(ii) water users licensing; and (iii) water source registration, disputes, and conflict resolution mechanisms. \n ", "  3\n6.  DWSS, within the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW), is the lead agency in \nthe  water  and  sanitation  sector.17 MPPW  is  responsible  for  formulating  and  guiding  sector \nactivities to meet targets and objectives outlined in the national development plans. The Town \nDevelopment Fund (TDF) was established under MPPW in 1996 to provide essential financial, \ninstitutional and technical support to institutions involved in town construction, development and \nexpansion activities. In agreement with the regulatory framework, 18 water user committees are, at \npresent, also responsible for implementing water supply projects and operation and maintenance \nof schemes.19 To ensure alignment with the decentralization and devolution process, DWSS is \nreviewing its role with a view to undertaking coordination, monitoring, policy formulation and \npromotion, and regulatory functions. There is a need, however, to conduct a comprehensive \ninstitutional reform program that will clearly define (i) a vision for the sector, with supporting \ninstitutional framework and road map; (ii) DWSS\u2019s role and responsibilities and its organizational \nstructure; and (iii) institutional mandates. \n \n7.  ADB has been an active partner in the sector for 20 years.20 The PPTA supports the \nGovernment in (i) promoting inclusive development and (ii) reducing poverty while promoting \nequitable development. The PPTA is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities, as outlined in \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program21 and its updates, which emphasize support for (i) promoting \npro-poor economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) good governance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the PPTA is improved basic water supply and sanitation infrastructure and \nservices in emerging small towns in Nepal. Its outcome is a project design and feasibility study \nagreed by Government and ADB. The PPTA is expected to formulate a comprehensive design for \na sector development program. Specific outputs will consist of (i) a revised urban water and \nsanitation sector policy and development plan, institutional assessment and policy matrix for \nproposed sector improvements; (ii) a feasibility study for integrated water supply and sanitation in \nemerging  towns22 suitable  for  ADB  financing  that  emphasizes  inclusive  development  and \nresponds to needs expressed by the community regarding priority infrastructure; and (iii) capacity \ndevelopment assistance for expediting project implementation and institutionalizing mechanisms \nfor sustainable community-based infrastructure development.  \n                                                 \n17  DWSS is the only agency supporting implementation of water supply and sanitation projects in urban areas. Three \nministries (Health, Education and Sports, and Local Development) complement these activities. \n18  The Water Resource Act (1992) and Water Resource Regulation (1993) provide for (i) prioritization of water use and \n(ii) formation and licensing of water user committees (ADB\u2019s Small Towns Water and Sanitation Sector Project \n[footnote 1] follows this model). In other instances local bodies or municipalities are responsible.  \n19  The existing system involves the formation of community-based water and sanitation user committees (WSUC). \nBasic  principles  include  (i)  community  involvement  in  planning,  design,  implementation,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance phases, often facilitated by NGOs; (ii) cost-sharing arrangements, involving contributions from WSUCs \nand local governments; and (iii) introduction of scheme-specific tariffs to recover operation and maintenance and \nrepayment of the TDF loan. While the WSUC model is generally performing well, feedback indicates the need for \ncontinued support after project completion to provide (i) training to new committee members, (ii) technical advice for \nimproved system performance, and (iii) access to financial resources for major rehabilitation and expansion. \n20 Lessons from previous projects highlight the need to (i) integrate water supply and sanitation programs; (ii) avoid \nconflicts with other water users and secure adequate water access rights; (iii) define mechanisms that involve the \npoor and disadvantaged and secure access to water and sanitation for all; (iv) implement annual water and \nsewerage tariff increases, taking into consideration annual inflation and adequate tariff objectives; (v) prepare and \nconceptualize  a  sustainability  platform  for  post-project  completion;  and  (vi)  develop  capacity  among  users, \nparticularly water and sanitation user committees, and institutionalize their role and responsibilities. \n21  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Nepal. Manila. \n22  The concept and definition of \u201cemerging\u201d towns will be prepared as part of the TA. \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  PPTA  will  (i)  support  inclusive  social  development  and  subsidiarity;  (ii)  seek \nopportunities to strengthen water user committees and promote women\u2019s participation; and (iii) \naim to involve stakeholders, beginning with the planning and design process.23 In order to ensure \na  far-reaching  design  for  a  subsequent  sector  development  program,  the  PPTA  has  been \nstructured to include three components. Component 1 will focus on strengthening policy and \ninstitutions, component 2 will develop an infrastructure investment package and component 3 will \ndevise an action program to expedite implementation and increase the capacity of implementing \nbodies (the Government, NGOs, etc.). Component 1 will conduct a comprehensive policy and \ninstitutional  analysis  for  the  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  and  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts in (i) reviewing and updating draft urban water supply and sanitation policies \nand  the  medium-term  development  plan,  and  (ii)  redefining  and  institutionalizing  the  role, \nresponsibilities and structure of DWSS within a devolved scheme. \n   \n10.  Component 2 will focus on the preparation of a comprehensive feasibility study comprising \n(i) a detailed need and demand evaluation for water supply and sanitation services in emerging \ntowns in Nepal, (ii) formulation of three to four sample subprojects and clear subproject selection \ncriteria, (iii) preparation of associated supporting documents, and (iv) a TDF assessment.24 In \naddition  to  infrastructure  development,  subcomponents  such  as  hygiene  education  will  be \nconsidered. 25  The  PPTA  will  also  seek  means  to  institutionalize  post-project  completion \nsustainability measures in community-based schemes. Component 3 of the PPTA will provide \nassistance to expedite project implementation. This component will support advance actions and \ninclude (i) provision of training to implementing structures and participating community-based \norganizations (CBOs) and NGOs for mobilization and planning phases, and (ii) preparation of \nstandardized manuals and guidelines for planning and design. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $848,000 equivalent. It is proposed that \n$120,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the Netherlands \nthrough the Water Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB; $600,000 equivalent \nfor components 2 and 3 will be financed on a grant basis, by the Japan Special Fund, funded by \nthe Government of Japan. The remaining $128,000 will be contributed by the Government and \nwill  include  office  accommodation  and  utilities,  counterpart  staff,  background  reports,  and \nworkshop facilities. Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are provided in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project.  \n                                                 \n23  The TA will be implemented in an inclusive manner, through extensive consultation, using community participation \nand ensuring that the design of the ensuing investment has an integrated approach to water and sanitation. \n24  For selected sample subprojects, the consultant will (i) collect and review basic planning data and processes, \ncapabilities, and resources for urban development in three to four urban centers, and in agreement with the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development directives, formulate basic urban land-use plans; (ii) in coordination \nwith the community and WSUCs, initiate socioeconomic surveys in the identified target areas (NGOs, local CBOs or \nwomen groups may be engaged for this purpose); (iii) map and perform spatial analysis of poverty data, incidence of \nwaterborne diseases, current and projected assistance, and concentration of minority and disadvantaged groups; (iv) \nundertake engineering field surveys and mapping to ascertain the condition of basic infrastructure and amenities, \nincluding current data on water and sanitation; and (v) confirm the need for improved coverage and ascertain (a) \npopulation projections, and  (b) demand for services.  Results  will be analyzed and discussed at stakeholder \nconsultations at national and town level. Subsequently, the PPTA will review government-proposed technical options \nacceptable to all stakeholders (developing new options if needed), and evaluate economic and financial feasibility, \nenvironmental  and  social  studies,  and  other  documentation,  as  required  by  ADB  guidelines.  An  institutional \ndevelopment and capacity-building program for WSUCs, government institutions and beneficiaries will be developed. \n25  Risks, such as project delays, will be considered in the sensitivity analysis. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The MPPW will be the Executing Agency and will appoint a fulltime PPTA unit coordinator \nwith a supportive, coordinating and facilitating role, and provide office space, furniture, equipment \nand technical and support counterpart staff for the TA consultants as necessary. Overall guidance \nfor TA implementation will be provided by a TA steering committee (TASC).26 The PPTA will be \nimplemented over a 12-month period (February 2008 to February 2009); components 1 and 2 will \nbe implemented over 7 months, starting in February 2008. A team of international and national \nconsultants will be recruited through a firm, using the quality-and-cost based selection method \nwith a standard quality-cost ratio of 80:20, to provide a total of 51.5 person-months of services. \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants and indicative scheduling are presented in \nAppendix 4. International expertise (15.5 person-months) will be obtained in the areas of water \nsupply  and  sanitation  policy,  governance  and  institutional  reform,  economics,  financial \nmanagement, and safeguards (social and environment). National consultants (36 person-months) \nwill have expertise in water supply engineering, sanitation and sewerage, environment, social \ndevelopment and gender, resettlement, financial analysis, urban planning and policy, governance \nand institutions. ADB\u2019s full technical proposal will be used for selecting the consultant firm. \nExtensive workshops and consultations will be conducted under both components of the TA. \nOffice  equipment  to  be  financed  by  the  TA  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The team of consultants will \nsubmit four major reports: (i) an inception report 4 weeks after commencement of services, (ii) an \ninterim report within 3 months, (iii) a draft report at the end of the sixth month, and (iv) a final \nreport within 4 weeks of receiving comments from the Government and ADB on the draft report. \nBoth draft final and final reports will contain separate sections for (a) the feasibility study and (b) \nthe policy and institutional assessment report. The consultants will also submit short monthly \nprogress  notes  summarizing  project  activities,  issues,  constraints  and  proposed  solutions. \nTripartite meetings will be held among ADB, the Government and the consultants to review \ninception,  midterm  and  draft  final  reports  and  verify  output-to-purpose  accomplishments. \nComponent 3 of the TA will, on completion of the feasibility study, engage individual consultants \n(approximately 15 person-months) to provide training and support bridging activities, including \nadvanced recruitment and procurement activities. The consultants will be selected and engaged \nby ADB in accordance with the ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Key deliverables from this TA will be translated by consultants to facilitate their \nreview  by  Government  and  other  stakeholders.  MPPW  will  complete  a  TA  completion \nquestionnaire to evaluate inputs and outputs, identify lessons learned and follow-up actions. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $120,000 to be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Government  of  Netherlands  through  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 \non a grant basis to the Government of Nepal for preparing the Improved Water Quality, Sanitation, \nand Service Delivery in Emerging Towns Sector Development Program, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                 \n26  The TASC will be headed by the Secretary of MPPW, and comprise senior government officials from DWSS, the \nministries of Finance, Local Development, Science, Technology and Environment, and Health, National Planning \nCommission, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and representatives from the Association of District \nDevelopment  Committees  of  Nepal  and  the  Municipalities  Association  of  Nepal.  Periodic  consultations  with \ndevelopment partners and NGOs will be held. The TASC will meet within 2 weeks of TA commencement to confirm \nsample TA subprojects, and within 8 weeks to review the first draft of the urban water and sanitation policy. The \nTASC will subsequently meet bi-monthly to review TA progress and provide direction, particularly on policy issues. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved basic water  Significant support to meeting  National and regional   \nsupply and sanitation  MDG 10 targets in Nepal.  statistics (water supply and  \u2022  Political stability and \ninfrastructure and services    sanitation)  peace \nin emerging small towns in  >95% compliance with    \u2022  Government \nNepal  government water distribution  PRSP monitoring (NPC)    commitment to devolution \n  standards in the project area.    \u2022  DWSS commits to abide \n  UNDP Human Development  by its new roles and \n>80% of all project small town  Reports  responsibilities \nschemes are sustainable.    \u2022  Macroeconomic stability \nNepal Living Standard   \nSurveys \n \nADB PCR and PPER \nOutcome      Assumptions \nProject design and  Project design and feasibility  Inception report  \u2022  All institutions actively \nfeasibility study   study delivered on time and    participate in the planning \n  agreed to by Government and  Interim report  and development process. \nADB    \u2022  Government and \nDraft final and final reports  beneficiary communities \n  are fully committed to \nTraining materials  long-term sustainability. \n   \nRisks \n\u2022  Not all key stakeholders \nparticipate in consensus-\nbuilding exercises. \n\u2022  Women and \ndisadvantaged groups are \nnot involved in project \nplanning and design. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: Despite significant improvements in economic \nand social indicators over the past two decades, studies show that poverty is still widespread in Nepal. While Nepal \nwas one of the countries in Asia that recorded significant improvement in the United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP) human development index (HDI) over the past decade, indicator levels remain low, even by South Asian \nstandards, and the level of absolute poverty is one of the highest in Asia. Nonetheless, Nepal\u2019s continued efforts have \nled to an overall decline in poverty incidence from 42% in 1995/1996 to 31% in 2003/2004 (Poverty Reduction \nStrategy Paper review 2004/2005). In 2005, Nepal ranked 136th out of 177 countries on the HDI, with a life \nexpectancy at birth of 61.6 years and an adult literacy rate of 48.6%. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has \nslowly  increased  from  $233  (2002)  to  about  $311  (2006),  and  much  of  the  economic  activity  and  wealth  is \nconcentrated in a few parts of the country. Human poverty in rural areas (42%) exceeds that in urban areas (25%). \nInequalities across geographic regions and ecological zones and between rural and urban areas remain significant, as \ndo inequalities across gender, ethnic, and caste lines. Poverty incidence in urban areas decreased from 22% to 10% \n(1995-2004 period), but the decrease in rural poverty was modest. Except for the rural eastern hills, overall poverty \nhas declined in all geographic regions.  \n \nNepal adopted the Millennium Declaration in 2000, committing to work towards attaining the Millennium Development \nGoals by 2015. Access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation is a priority of the Poverty Reduction Strategy,  \nwhich aims to raise water supply coverage from 71% to 85%. Poor access to water supply and sanitation is often \nassociated with poor health. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country strategy for Nepal emphasizes the role \nof water supply, sanitation and urban development infrastructure, and the need to target the poor to reduce both \npoverty and inequalities. In a similar fashion, the Government\u2019s Interim Plan is expected to emphasize the importance \nof providing safe drinking water through construction of new and augmentation of existing schemes ones. Access to \nsafe drinking water, improved sanitation, and improved environmental quality will reduce the vulnerability of poor \ncommunities to environmental hazards. Improved quantity and quality of domestic water supply and sanitation facilities \nwill reduce morbidity and mortality, especially among young children. The availability of safe drinking water supplies \nwill reduce water-carrying time, which will mainly benefit women and girls. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? Poverty incidence is higher among ethnic minorities (e.g., the Limbus, \nTamangs, Magars, Tharus, and Mushahars), and caste-based social exclusion contributes to disparities in both \npoverty incidence and human development indicators. Causal factors underlying poverty in Nepal include (i) slow \noverall economic growth in the face of relatively rapid population growth; (ii) weak redistributive and institutional \ncapacity overall on the part of the Government; (iii) nonagricultural growth that lacks any significant spillover effects on \nthe rural poor; (iv) low productivity and slow growth of output in the agriculture sector; and (v) weak social and \neconomic infrastructure (education, health, drinking water, transport, and energy), leading to inadequate access by the \npoor to the means for escaping poverty. \n \nA multidimensional and multivariable poverty analysis will be required for the project. Although national and district \nsurvey data are a good starting point, local level detail is lacking. Town and village development committee-level data \non population, literacy, health indicators, water and electricity availability, sanitation services, and other human \ndevelopment indexes will be utilized as part of the coverage selection criteria. Detailed survey data will be required to \nestimate (i) access by various groups to water and sanitation facilities, (ii) modes of delivery, (iii) quality of water \nsources, (iv) time spent by women and children collecting water, (v) cost of various services and infrastructure in the \narea, (vi) affordability of most disadvantaged groups, and (vii) direct and indirect poverty impact of various services.  \n \nThe detailed socioeconomic survey will be conducted for selected sample towns where specific information on income \nand expenditure, demographic trends, gender issues, health, water and sanitation, and the urban environment will be \ndetermined. Sample data and secondary data sources will be utilized and extrapolated to other project areas. The \nfindings of the socioeconomic baseline survey will be used to improve the access of the poor to existing and newly \ncreated  infrastructure  facilities  and  urban  services.  Participatory  methods  and  innovative  poverty  assessment \ntechniques will be considered to identify the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nC.  Participation Process \n \nWill a stakeholder analysis be prepared?    Yes     No  \nPreliminary stakeholder assessment was conducted during the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) fact-\nfinding mission. Stakeholders to participate in the project include the urban poor (including women and different ethnic \nand caste groups), all tiers of government (including central and district governments and local authorities), water user \nand sanitation committees, community based organizations (CBOs), aid agencies, nongovernment organizations, and, \nwhere relevant and appropriate, selected members of the private sector. \n \nWill a participation strategy be prepared?     Yes                   No \n \nThe participation strategy for the technical assistance (TA) will focus on ensuring inclusive development through the \nproject\u2019s planning, design implementation, management, and operation and maintenance. Communities  will be \ninvolved from the outset through a socioeconomic analysis that will include appreciative enquiry and rapid assessment \nmethods, and through community participation in the identification and mapping of current urban infrastructure and \nservices. Workshops will be held with representatives of all stakeholder groups during all stages of project design. The \nparticipatory project mechanism will be based on the self-help tradition, adapted to local conditions. The existing \nextended household structure provides natural groupings that can be mobilized, strengthened, and utilized as a \nnucleus for CBOs. By building partnerships with CBOs and responding to their demands, the project will contribute to \ngrassroots participatory development. This approach ensures (i) participation of beneficiaries in project design and \nimplementation, leading to greater ownership; and (ii) decentralized and localized implementation arrangements, with \ncapacity support to government and community groups in implementation and maintenance; and (iv) the use of widely \naccepted technology. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Social policies, slow economic growth and consequent persistent poverty \namong segments of the population, in combination with armed conflict and social norms, have contributed to uneven \ndevelopment that impacts women\u2019s quality of life. Gender-based exclusion in Nepal is pervasive and deep-rooted, with \ndiscrimination against women negatively affecting their physical survival, health and educational opportunities, asset \nownership, mobility, and overall status. \n \nWomen have major responsibilities within households, including ensuring water is available for household purposes \nand the needs of individual household members. In the areas to be served by the proposed project, women face \nvarious problems relating to access to safe water and sanitation facilities due to a lack of water sources, deterioration \nof water quality, and increased time required to obtain water, which reduces time for other activities. The TA will \nspecifically address gender issues, including through participation by women in planning and design, and identification \nof constraints to and opportunities for the active participation by women in the implementation of the ensuing project. A \ngender action plan for the project will be prepared. Targeting of women requires a modified approach consistent with \nlocal culture and traditions in different parts of Nepal. Specific activities will include: (i) inclusion of both local men and \nwomen  in  the  project  activities;  (ii)  gender  training  and  awareness-raising  for  all;  (iii)  promotion  of  women\u2019s \nemployment in water projects; and (iv) use of participatory approaches, along with the presence of gender sensitive \nindividuals. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No, it will be prepared as part of PPTA. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n \n \nE.

Components 1 and 2 of the technical assistance (TA) will design a sector development \nprogram and be implemented over 7 months. Component 1 will provide a design to improve \npolicy and institutional arrangements in the urban water and sanitation sector; component 2 will \nprepare a feasibility study for a water and environmental infrastructure investment proposal. The \ncomponents will complement and inform each other. Component 2 will be divided into two \nphases, the first involving a detailed analysis of the sector and its institutions and collecting \nessential data (including poverty, social and technical information), and the second preparing a \ndetailed feasibility study. \n \nA.  Component 1 \u2013 Designing Policy and Institutional Improvements \n1.  Assessing the Sector and its Institutions \n2.  The consultants will conduct a detailed analysis of the urban water supply and sanitation \nsector in Nepal, conducting a thorough assessment of (i) the existing legal and policy framework \n(to include both urban town planning and water and sanitation sectors) and its relation with \ndecentralization acts and processes, and (ii) the Government\u2019s financing resources, financing \ngaps  and  existing  sector  modalities  and  approaches.  The  consultants  will  prepare  (i)  a \ndevelopment coordination matrix outlining existing and proposed interventions in related sectors, \nand an institutional and capacity assessment of sector-related institutions; and (ii) formulate \nrecommendations for reform. In particular, the consultant\u2019s team will review service delivery \nprotocols  and  assess  local-level  service  delivery,  regulation,  monitoring,  coordination  and \nplanning, determining existing levels and needs. Based on this assessment and extensive work \nconducted  by  institutional  specialists  under  the  on-going  Small  Towns  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Project, and in close consultation with other development partners, they will review \nand  propose  (i)  a  new  vision,  (ii)  revised  roles  and  responsibilities,  and  (iii)  a  supporting \norganizational structure for the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS).  \n \n3.  Take the lead role in organizing discussion sessions across the country (both at the \ncenter  and  district  levels)  to  provide  an  opportunity  for  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (PPTA) team to better understand the context of governance reforms in relation to \nservice delivery (including central-level reforms and their impact on local governance). This \nincludes assessing how service delivery is to be improved and the potential roles of community \ngroups, the private sector, and local governments. \n \n2.  Formulating  an  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  (WSS)  Policy  and \nDevelopment Plan \n4.  The team will (i) review the Government\u2019s draft urban water and sanitation policy; (ii) \nassess its relevance within the current country context and propose any needed revisions;1 and \n(iii)  conduct  wide  consultations  with  and  incorporate  comments  from  the  Government, \ndevelopment partners and other stakeholders working in the sector. The team will also (i) review \nthe Government\u2019s 15-year Development Plan for Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation and \nevaluate implementation progress, (ii) review its applicability to current conditions, and (iii) \nformulate a new and/or revised medium-term development plan for urban sector WSS. The \nteam will also support the Government in defining the \u201cemerging town\u201d concept. \n \n                                                 \n1  Essential needed elements may include (i) fully inclusive pro-poor principles, and (ii) integrated water and \nsanitation approaches to service delivery. \n ", "  Appendix 4  15 \n3.  Program Design  \n5.  Based on information collected, the consultants will prepare the design for a program \ncomponent (i) outlining the macroeconomic context, and (ii) describing and detailing proposed \npolicy  and  institutional  reforms.  The  consultants  will  prepare  (i)  a  policy  matrix,2 including \nobjective, actions, indicators and implementation responsibilities; (ii) program organization and \nimplementation mechanisms; (iii) a program design and monitoring framework; and (iv) specific \nassessments identifying (a) the poverty impact of the policy reform, (b) the proposed cost of \npolicy reforms, (c) environmental and social assessment of policy actions,3 and (d) program \nbenefits, impacts, and risks.  \n \n6.  Improvements  will  include  (i)  building  the  capacity  of  local  governments,  local \ngovernment service (once established), and community-based organizations to deliver more \neffective service; and (ii) the use of tools to allow service providers to be held accountable for \ntheir performance. Means to improve the performance of water and sanitation user committees \n(WSUCs)  may  include  development  and/or  strengthening  of  national  and  district-level \nfederations of water user committees. \n \nB.  Component 2 \u2013 Preparing a Sector Feasibility Study \n1.  Formulating Project Concept and Sample Subproject Proposals \n7.  Lessons. The team will review and analyze existing studies, reports, urban water and \nsanitation data, and related information, including lessons from past water supply and sanitation \nand urban development projects in Nepal, including projects assisted by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and other agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and community-based \norganizations (CBOs), especially those involving WSUCs.4 The team will share lessons learned \nwith the government and local authorities, as well as representatives of citizen groups. Findings, \nrecommendations and responses will be reflected in the inception report. \n \n8.  Sample  Subproject  Selection.  The  consultants  will  review  the  adequacy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s sample subproject criteria and subsequent selection of three to four sample \nsubprojects. Conditions in the sample subproject areas (e.g. population sizes and densities,5 \ngeographical characteristics, and socioeconomic conditions) should vary, so as to facilitate \nsubsequent  replication.  Subproject  proposals  should  develop  options  for  (i)  water,  (ii) \nsanitation,6 and (iii) solid waste management. If necessary, subproject criteria for replication of \nnon-sample subprojects will be provided. \n \n9.  Data  Collection  on  Infrastructure  and  Service  Delivery.  The  consultants  will  (i) \nassess  total  financing  available  for  the  urban  WSS  sector,  including  from  the  central  and \nprovincial governments and aid pipelines; (ii) collect and assess community data on general \n                                                 \n2  Policy actions may relate to efficiency incentives, devolution of managerial powers, empowerment of communities \nor the private sector, among others.  \n3  See also http://www.adb.org/documents/Guidelines/Environmental_Assessment/eaguidelines004.asp. \n4  Using lessons drawn from past experience, the consultants will also search the Evaluations Information System \n(available: http://ADB.org/evaluation), and past project completion and project performance evaluation reports to \nidentify lessons relevant to the project design, indicating in the report how these lessons have influenced the \nproject design and proposed implementation arrangements. \n5  Population levels are expected to range between 4,000 and 40,000 inhabitants. \n6  It is expected that a simple sewerage model with basic sewage treatment facilities will be developed for a larger \ntown.

Social  Safeguards.  The  consultants  will  determine  the  number  of  minorities  and \nvulnerable people, their socioeconomic status, and the anticipated impact of the project on them, \nusing (among other tools) ADB\u2019s Checklist for Categorization of Indigenous People; if necessary, \nan indigenous peoples development framework and plans will be developed according to ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous People (1998). Responses will be based on information gathered using \nculturally appropriate methodologies, including a well-devised consultation process. \n \n18.  Early during TA implementation the consultant will apply ADB\u2019s resettlement checklists \nto identify resettlement issues and ascertain the nature and degree of the project\u2019s impacts on \naffected households. Based on the assessment, the consultants will determine if there are \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts in sample subproject towns; if impacts exist consultants will \nprepare,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  Handbook  on \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 1993.

The  consultants  will  also  prepare  a \nresettlement  framework,  whose  contents  shall  be  consistent  with  those  outlined  in  the \nresettlement plan(s) for small towns. \n \n19.  Environmental Assessment of Sample Subprojects. The consultants will prepare an \ninitial environmental examination and summary for each of the sample project towns covering \neach  subcomponent,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Guidelines  (2003)18,  as  well  as  Nepal\u2019s  Environment  Protection  Act  and \nassociated environmental regulations.19 The consultant will (i) assess positive and negative \nenvironmental impacts of proposed urban social infrastructure and services related to location, \ndesign,  construction,  and  O&M;  (ii)  propose  mitigation  measures  and  develop  a  full \nenvironmental monitoring plan; (iii) conduct consultations as per ADB requirements; and (iv) \nformulate environmental management plans for environmentally sensitive subcomponents. As \nper  para  20  (below),  the  consultants  will  also  evaluate  TDF\u2019s  environmental  management \nsystems,20 and procedures for environmental assessment and review of loans; if necessary, the \nconsultants will prepare an environmental assessment and review procedure framework.  \n \n2.  Assessing the Town Development Fund  \n20.  The consultants will assess (i) TDF\u2019s financial soundness as evidenced by adequate \ncapital, asset quality, liquidity, and profitability; (ii) adequacy of credit and risk management \npolicies,  operating  systems,  and  procedures;  (iii)  compliance  with  prudential  regulations, \nincluding  exposure  limits;  (iv)  acceptability  of  corporate  and  financial  governance  and \nmanagement practices, including, among other things, transparent financial disclosure policies \nand practices; (v) soundness of business objectives and strategy and/or plan; (vi) autonomy in \nlending  decisions;  and  (vii)  adequacy  of  policies, systems,  and procedures  to  assess  and \nmonitor the economic, social, and environmental impact of subprojects, in accordance with \nparameters  established  by  and  procurement  methods  acceptable  to  ADB.

Sector Project Design \n21.  Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening. To ensure the sustainability of the \ninvestments  under  the  project,  the  consultants  will  develop  a  carefully  designed  capacity-\nbuilding  program  for  WSUCs  and  beneficiaries.  In  addition,  the  consultants  will  devise  a \ncomprehensive capacity-building program for communities to manage, operate, and maintain \nproposed  facilities,  including,  where  relevant,  user  charges,  community  collection  and \nadministration, and hygiene education and awareness programs and campaigns.  \n \n23.  Project Management and Implementation Assistance. The consultants will estimate \nrequirements  for  adequate  project  implementation  in  engineering,  planning,  project \nmanagement, and other essential disciplines. Based on evaluation of staff and available skills, \nconsultants will recommend additional recruitment and/or upgrading of expertise. They will \nassess the institutional strengths and weaknesses of executing and implementing agencies, \nrecommend  strengthening  of  institutional  capabilities  through  organizational  changes, \nimplementation  arrangements,  staff  training  and  use  of  consultants,  and  prepare  terms  of \nreference accordingly. The consultants will also identify essential activities to be conducted \nunder component 3 of this TA to expedite project implementation.  \n \n24.  Based  on  reported  experience,  consultants  will  propose  (i)  effective  implementation \narrangements for the ensuing project; (ii) a procurement plan for the project that supports \neffective and comprehensive packaging; (iii) a schedule enabling timely interaction between \nNGOs, consultants, and contractors; (iv) effective loan implementation arrangements in line with \ndevolution mandates; and (v) innovative mechanisms for inclusion of the poorest and most \ndisadvantaged sectors of the population in WSS. \n \n25.  Consultations  and  Consensus  Building.  To  ensure  community  participation  from \nplanning and design stages and enhanced ownership, the consultants will carry out public \nconsultations in each of the selected towns. 22 Stakeholder workshops at national, district and \ntown level will be conducted throughout the Project, including (i) initial data collection phase and \nevaluation  study;  (ii)  early  stages  of  design  to  identify  needs,  options  and  priorities;  (iii) \ndiscussions with other water users and reaching of a common agreement; (iv) disclosure and \nagreement on final designs; and (v) environmental and social safeguards public consultation.\n                                                 \n21  TDF was established under the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works in 1996 to provide essential financial, \ntechnical and institutional support to institutions for town construction, development and expansion. TDF has \nreceived funding loan and grant projects from the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, and \nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ). Currently, TDF\u2019s portfolio and operations are \nsupported through KfW Development Bank grants and ADB funding. The financial statements are audited annually \nby an independent auditor and submitted to the Government. Projects under KfW include loans (75%) and grants \n(25%) to municipalities. Reserve funds have been generated, but guidelines regarding their use have yet to be \nprepared and issued. TDF has limited staff available and functions under the ongoing ADB Small Towns Water \nSupply  and  Sanitation  Project  relate  to  economic  and  financial  viability  assessments  only,  with  technical \nevaluations left exclusively to the implementing agency. As a financial intermediary the TDF should also secure \ntechnical and safeguards compliance. In addition to Government\u2019s long-term bond interest rates, the TDF charges \na service fee, which has sometimes been challenged by communities when comparing with commercial rates. \nPrograms for capacity development of water user committees on accounting and financial matters must also be \nsystematically conducted by this agency, as this would also ensure adequate client response and communication. \n22  The use of qualified NGOs to assist with participation and consultative activities may be considered. The use of the \n\u201cenhanced methodology for participatory assessments\u201d, successfully piloted by ADB, may be considered, as the \nanalytical framework focuses on sustainability while integrating demand, gender and poverty concerns at every \nstage of the project cycle. This has proven to be a cost-effective tool that empowers communities to make their \nown observations and analyses, from the planning stage to long-term operations. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20071008100740+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20071001154002+08'00'", "Title": "Preparing the Improved Water Quality, Sanitation, and Service Delivery in Emerging Towns Sector Development Program (Cofinanced by the Japan Special Fund and the Government of the Netherlands through the Water Financing Partnership Facility)", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Keywords": "nepali water supply sanitation programs, nepali solid waste management projects, nepali urban environmental improvement, nepali project preparatory technical assistance, nepali water supply sanitation infrastructure, tar: nep 41022, adb loan 4972", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
