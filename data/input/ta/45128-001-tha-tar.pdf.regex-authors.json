INTRODUCTION \n1.  Early in 2011, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor  policy  advice  to  develop  microfinance  in  Thailand  and  promote  financial  inclusion.  In \nresponse, ADB conducted inception and reconnaissance missions (30 March, 2\u20136 May, and     \n12 May 2011). During a 11\u201325 July 2011 fact-finding mission, the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) of \nMOF, the government\u2019s executing agency, agreed on the proposed impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference as laid out \nin the approved concept paper. Meetings with the Bank of Thailand, microfinance providers, and \nother relevant stakeholders provided additional background information that confirmed the need \nfor technical assistance (TA). The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2011\u2013\n20131 under the country partnership strategy, 2007\u201320112 for Thailand. The project design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.    Despite Thailand\u2019s success in lowering the national incidence of poverty, significant \npockets of subnational poverty remain. The government\u2019s household socioeconomic survey,4 \nused to estimate the poverty rate, shows, that the poverty incidence has continuously declined \nfrom 33.8% in 1988 to 9% in 2008, which is relatively low compared with other middle-income \ncountries.  However,  the  aggregate  poverty  figure  masks  considerable  differences  in  the \nincidence of poverty across subnational regions and sectors.5 One important cause of poverty in \nthese regions and an important characteristic of inequality in Thailand is lack of access to a \nvariety of financial services.   \n \n3.    While published data indicate that a large share of the population has access to financial \nservices,6   the  degree  of  access  varies  considerably  across  income  groups.  Low-income \nfamilies (the poorest 40% of households by income quintile) have access to a limited range of \nfinancial services and of lower quality services compared with middle- to high-income families \n(the richest 60% of households by income quintile). For example, about 38% of low-income \nfamilies have only used one or two types of financial services, while another 16% do not use \nfinancial services at all. Almost 80% of middle- to high-income families use three or more types \nof financial services. Similarly, almost half of low-income households do not borrow compared \nwith 27% of middle- to high-income households. About 28% of low-income households do not \nhave access to savings products compared with 6% from middle- to high-income groups.  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010.

About 90% of the poor reside in rural areas; most are concentrated in the northeast (about \n58%)  and  the  north  (26%),  while  Bangkok  has  almost  no  poverty  (0.86%).  Source:  \nK.

Ariyapruchya, W. Sinswat, and N. Chutchotitham. 2007. The Wealth and Debt of Thai \nHouseholds: Risk Management and Financial Access. Bank of Thailand Symposium 2007. Bangkok. \n ", "2 \n4.    Microfinance development in Thailand began in 1966 when the government created the \nstate-owned Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) to provide farm credits \nto  decrease  informal  debt.  In  1974,  the  Community  Development  Department  initiated \ncommunity savings groups to provide savings and credit to households. Since this time, while \nthe government continues to provide financial services to low-income households, the range of \nservices is limited, and services are heavily subsidized and primarily focused on microcredit.  \n \n5.    Microfinance in Thailand currently comprises three main categories: (i) formal and large \nmicrofinance  institutions\u2014bank  and  nonbank  institutions  that  operate  under  prudential \nregulations\u2014including  commercial  banks  and  special  financial  institutions;  (ii)  semiformal \nmicrofinance institutions operating under nonprudential regulations that are member-based and \ncan capture savings and investments within communities (includes agricultural, savings, and \ncredit  union  cooperatives;  registered  savings-for-production  groups;  and  village  and  urban \nrevolving  funds;  and  (iii)  informal  independent  and  self-help  savings  and  credit  groups\u2014\ncommunity and member-based organizations\u2014that are often supported by external entities \nincluding nongovernment organizations (NGOs) or local government agencies. Government-\nowned and subsidized special financial institutions have the dominant market share in the \nmicrofinance industry servicing low-income households.7 \n \n6.    Because of strong government involvement in microfinance and a weak regulatory and \nsupervisory framework for financial inclusion, entry of other microfinance institutions has been \ncomplicated,  difficult,  and  highly  restricted.  With  very  narrow  options  for  service  providers \nworking under multiple regulators, private sector entry has been stifled, preventing necessary \nmarket competition, innovation, and service expansion. The key regulatory impediments to \nprivate sector participation include the interest rate ceilings for nonbanking financial institutions \n(NBFIs), licensing restrictions on MFI entry, and government-subsidized programs. Currently, \nmicrofinance licenses are only issued to domestic banks. Exemptions for preexisting nonprofit \nNGOs are considered on a case-by-case basis and stipulate that the institution restrict its \nactivities to group lending only, inhibiting financially sustainable growth and preventing the \ndevelopment of a range of products and services beyond credit that clients need. The lack of \nprivate sector participation in microfinance has also limited efficiency and innovation. Thailand\u2019s \nmicrofinance industry lags far behind those in other countries in the region.8 For example, \nmobile phone banking has grown rapidly in other emerging markets (such as the Philippines) \nbut is essentially absent in Thailand. Microinsurance, critical to mitigating risks to the poor, is in \nits infancy but is growing fast with huge potential in Thailand. Over the last 4 years, a few \nproviders have been making insurance accessible for farmers. In 2010, the government adopted \na  microinsurance  strategy  and  is  committed  to  developing  the  subsector.  A  strengthened \nregulatory  framework  promoting  microinsurance  will  be  important  for  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for the sector to grow.    \n \n7.    Due  to  the  overabundance  of  inexpensive  credit  in  certain  areas  and  low  financial \nliteracy, over-indebtedness and increased dependence on moneylenders has grown in some \nregions. In the current circumstances, financial service providers have little to no incentive to \ndevelop  important  financial  services  for  low-income  populations,  including  appropriately \n                                                \n7  MOF estimates that credit supplied by formal financial institutions is about B7.73 trillion (approximately $235 billion) \nor about 89.7% of total credit in 2007. Source: Banking with the Poor Network Network, Microfinance Industry \nReport, Thailand, 2010. \n8 Thailand ranked 50 out of 54 countries around the world in terms of its overall microfinance ranking and at the \nbottom of the scale in both regional and global comparisons based on an evaluation of the country\u2019s microfinance \nregulatory framework, investment climate, and institutional development.

", "3 \n \ndesigned  and  priced  microinsurance,  remittance  services,  pensions,  and  mobile  banking \nservices. The absence of a system for consumer protection and the lack of comprehensive \nfinancial education for low-income clients have further contributed to low financial inclusion. The \nsituation  is  compounded  by  a  weak  and  fragmented  regulatory  framework  and  lack  of \ninformation on the real supply and demand for credit by low-income populations. As a new entity \nwithin the MOF, the Bureau of Financial Inclusion Policy and Development, (FIPD) in particular, \nwould  benefit  from  strengthened  capacity  to  collect  data  on  the  sector  and  to  oversee \nimplementation of a strategy for financial inclusion. \n \n8.    Realizing  the  issues  above,  the  government  is  pursuing  an  inclusive  growth \ndevelopment strategy.  Inclusive growth is the underlying concept of the draft 11th national \neconomic and social development plan. The plan\u2019s first objective is to build a fairer society to \nensure social justice, and access to funding and resources to make a living. Policies and market \nrules that encourage easier and affordable access to financial services will at least partly \naddress the challenges of achieving more inclusive growth.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.    The overall impact of the TA will be improved access of the poor to a diverse range of \nfinancial products and services. The outcome will be an improved regulatory and supervisory \nframework and institutional capacity to support the development of inclusive finance. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Under output 1, using a holistic approach,9 a comprehensive, diagnostic of financial \ninclusion  will  be  completed focusing  on  areas  with  higher  poverty  incidence  in the  north\u2013\nnortheast, and south\u2013southeast. The project team will propose a methodology for conducting a \ncomprehensive financial inclusion diagnostic and will conduct an assessment of the (i) current \nlegal, regulatory, and supervisory framework; (ii) supply and demand for microfinance products \nand services, including any gender bias in terms of access and affordability;10 (iii) consumer \nprotection; (iv) financial literacy; (v) microinsurance; (vi) remittances; (vii) micropensions; and \n(viii) mobile banking. This will require close collaboration with relevant government agencies \nand extensive consultation on the draft materials with NGOs, community groups, and other key \nstakeholders. For the microinsurance component of the TA, consultants will use the toolkits11 \nand  other  methodologies  of  the  Access  to  Insurance  Initiative  (A2II).12 The  results  of  the \ndiagnostic will provide the basis for developing a national strategy for financial inclusion (NSFI). \n \n11.  Output 2 includes an approved NSFI accompanied by an implementation plan focusing \non regulatory and market improvements in microfinance, consumer protection, financial literacy, \nand microinsurance. The TA team will hold a series of government and stakeholder meetings \n                                                \n9  Focus on financial inclusion rather than just microfinance and looking at both financial and non-financial services    \nand the role of a wide range of private and public stakeholders. \n10 This might include lack of property rights, other types of collateral, or other factors that may impede women from \nutilizing financial services. \n11  http://www.access-to-insurance.org/guidance-and-tools/a2ii-toolkits.html?sword_list[0]=toolkits \n12 A2II is a global program designed to strengthen the capacity and understanding of insurance supervisors, to \nfacilitate their role in expanding access to insurance markets, and to support the implementation of sound \nregulatory and supervisory frameworks consistent with international standards.   \n ", "4 \nand workshops to develop the draft NSFI and implementation plan.13 Once consensus for the \ndraft strategy is achieved, a national stakeholder workshop (or workshops in key regions) will be \nheld to include relevant financial institutions, development agencies, NGOs, and academics \ninvolved in microfinance. The resulting NSFI and implementation plan will be submitted for \nconsideration and approval by the government, and a national conference to launch the strategy \nwill be held once the plan is approved. \n \n12.   Output  3  is  strengthened  capacity  of the  Bureau  of  Financial  Inclusion  Policy  and \nDevelopment (FIPD) to conduct its supervisory responsibility. A capacity assessment of FIPD\u2019s \nability to perform its delegated functions for financial inclusion will be followed by a series of \ncapacity-building workshops to address needs. The main areas for training are expected to be   \n(i) strategy for microfinance,14 (ii) strategy for microinsurance, and (iii) informal debt resolution.  \n \n13.  Output 4 is a financial inclusion database installed within FIPD. The TA team will assess \nthe requirements for an appropriately structured database for the executing agency to capture \nthe supply and demand for financial services on a permanent basis (with data segregated by \nsex and ethnicity).15 It will then identify appropriate systems for implementation, and help install \nand train staff on data flow, system management, and analysis. \n \n14.    Output 5 is implementation of two priority tasks included in the implementation plan. As \nthe government has already identified consumer protection and financial literacy as priorities, \nthe initial tasks will likely include development of draft consumer protection regulation and the \nrollout of a financial literacy campaign.  \n \n15.  By ensuring collaborative dialogue among all stakeholders throughout the diagnostic \nphase,  development  of  a  national  strategy,  and  the  setting  of  realistic  goals,  the  risk  of \ninsufficient market response to new financial service opportunities should be mitigated. This will \nalso  support  the  realization  of  successful  implementation  of  the  final  NSFI  and  related \nimplementation plan within a reasonable time frame. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.    The Government has requested $1,500,000 equivalent in financing.  The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB.  \nThe Government will provide counterpart support in the form of remuneration of counterpart \nstaff, office space and meeting venues, furniture, administration support, logistics and other in-\nkind contributions.  (See Appendix 2 for the cost estimates and financing plan.) \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years, from February 2012 to February 2015.16  FPO  \nwill be the executing agency, while FIPD will be the main point of contact for the TA. Other \nimplementing agencies will be the Bank of Thailand, responsible for assisting with regulatory \n                                                \n13 Two  committees  will  be  established  to  ensure  maximum  collaborative decision-making: a  national  steering \ncommittee comprising representatives of key government agencies involved in financial inclusion; and an advisory \ncommittee comprising key nongovernment stakeholders including NGOs, community financial service providers, \nand  private  sector  entities  engaged  in  microfinance,  development  organizations,  and  gender-balanced \nrepresentatives of the users of financial services.  \n14 Including a focus on equal access to financial services in terms of gender and ethnicity. \n15 The team will consult the National Statistics Office during the assessment. \n16 The TA is expected to commence on 20 February 2012 and be completed by 20 February 2015. ", "5 \n \nand  supervisory  elements  of  the  TA  and  the  Office  of  the  Insurance  Commission  for  the \nmicroinsurance component. A national steering committee, to oversee development of the NSFI, \nwill  be  made  up  of  key  government  agency  representatives  (BAAC,  Bank  of  Thailand, \nCommunity Development Department, Government Savings Bank, the Ministry of Agriculture \nand Cooperatives, and the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, MOF, Office of \nthe  Insurance  Commission).17 An  advisory  council  will  comprise  external  stakeholders  and \nmicrofinance  service  providers.  The  consultants,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  executing \nagency, will conduct workshops, training, seminars, conferences, and surveys. \n \n18.  The TA will require seven international consultants (for a total of 32 person-months) and \nfive  national  consultants  (for  a  total  of  61  person-months),  with  expertise  in  microfinance \nregulation  and  supervision,  information  system  development,  microinsurance,  consumer \nprotection  and  financial  literacy,  and  gender  and  pro-poor  activities.  ADB  will  engage  the \nconsultants under a firm using quality- and cost-based selection with 80%\u201320% quality and cost. \nThis will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The team leader will \nbe  responsible  for  all  outputs  consistent  with  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  The \nconsultants will work out of an office provided by FIPD and report to the head of FIPD on day-to-\nday matters and to the ADB team leader for all other matters.  \n \n19.    In addition to the main outputs, the consultants will submit to ADB and the executing \nagency (i) an inception report 2 weeks after commencement of services; (ii) interim progress \nreports at appropriate stages during TA implementation; (iii) the draft summary final report for \nthe overall TA before the conclusion of the contract; and (iv) revised final report 2 weeks after \nreceiving and taking into account the comments of, and feedback from, the executing agency, \nother stakeholders, and ADB. All key final output reports and the final summary report of the \nresults of the overall TA will be submitted in English and Thai.  \n \n20.    The executing agency and ADB review missions will regularly monitor and report on \nmajor  project  activities.  Consultants\u2019 reports  will  be  presented  in  workshops  and  seminars \norganized for the validation of findings. Reports will be made available on ADB websites in \nEnglish  and  Thai  (if  deemed  feasible  by  ADB  and  the  executing  agency)  and  published \nwhenever warranted. Knowledge products will be developed and disseminated as appropriate. \n \n21.  Equipment for use by the TA consultants will be procured by ADB in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and will be handed over \nat the end of the TA to FPO. The TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).18 \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment  of  Thailand  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction for the Development of a Strategic Framework for Financial Inclusion, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n                                                \n17  Specifically from the Office of Welfare Promotion, Protection and Empowerment of Vulnerable Groups and Office    \n     of Women\u2019s Affairs and Family Development. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators with  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nBaselines \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved access of the  Number of the population  Household socioeconomic  The government \npopulation to a diverse  without access to formal  survey, Economic Statistics  implements the financial \nrange of financial  financial services decreases  Division, Socio-Economic  inclusion strategy and \nproducts and services  by 10% by 2017 (baseline  Statistics Branch,  related implementation \nas of 2010: 6.5 million)a  Household Income- plan \nExpenditure Section   \n  Risk \nFPO financial inclusion  Insufficient market \ndatabase   response to new financial \nservices opportunities  \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved regulatory  Two key regulatory  BOT and MOF annual  Policy reform measures \nand supervisory  improvements completed  reports  can be implemented \nframework to support  with gender issues  under reasonable a time \nthe development of  integrated into at least one  frame \ninclusive finance  (identified in the \nimplementation plan for the \nnational financial inclusion \nstrategy) by the of end \n2014(baseline: zero) \nOutputs       \n1.
