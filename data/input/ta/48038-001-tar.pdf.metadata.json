INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The country partnership strategy (CPS), 2013\u20132017 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) highlighted that the capacity constraints of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic are a \nmajor risk in implementing the CPS effectively.1 With 86.8% of the total CPS envelope intended \nfor the infrastructure and education sectors, continued improvement in project management and \nmonitoring capacity for those sectors is critical. \n \n2.  In response to the government request, in its country operations business plan, 2014\u2013\n2016 ADB included a technical assistance (TA) project for strengthening the government\u2019s \ncapacity  to  manage  development  projects.2 The  TA  will  strengthen  the  management  of   \ndevelopment projects and improve the effectiveness and results of development interventions in \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Improved  management  of  development  projects  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  ongoing  reform  efforts  in  public  financial  management  and  enhance  good \ngovernance in the public sector. The government has concurred with the objectives, costs and \nfinancing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  for  consultants.3 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013\u20132017 stated \nthat increasing efficiency and ensuring good governance in the public sector is important for the \nsuccessful development of the country. It emphasizes that the public investment program needs \nto  focus  on  supporting  and  improving  strategically  important  infrastructure  and  optimizing \nprocedures to improve project implementation and results monitoring. \n \n4.  The  increasing  demand  by  the  government  and  development  partners  for  fast  and \nquality results from development projects requires a sound and sustainable operational system \nthat reinforces good governance in project management. Foreign assistance projects support \nthe government in addressing the financial and human capacity constraints it faces in meeting \nits development objectives, but weak operational and management capacity continues in the \ncentral and sector agencies. Despite the risk mitigation measures built into all ADB operations in \nthe country, the project implementation risk remains very high and keeps the overall portfolio \nperformance  weak,  as  reflected  in  indicators  such  as  disbursement  ratio,  project  start-up \ncompliance, and average loan extension. \n \n5.  Outdated construction industry standards; an inadequate regulatory framework; and the \nlimited number of qualified suppliers, contractors, and consultants in the local market are the \nother constraints, which increase the risks for implementing investment projects. \n \n6.  The  systemic  issues  which  continue  to  hinder  more  effective  implementation  and \nimproved results include (i) limited ownership and unsatisfactory supervision of investment \nprojects, which weakens the accountability of executing and implementing agencies; (ii) poor \nproject implementation because of the lack of capacity in executing agencies, implementing \nagencies,  and  project  implementation  units;  (iii)  weak  policy  and  methodology  for  results \nmonitoring and sustainability of project outputs; and (iv) lengthy internal government procedures \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Country Partnership Strategy: Kyrgyz Republic, 2013\u20132017. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Kyrgyz Republic, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n3  Discussions were held with the government in June and October 2014 for concept preparation and fact-finding. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 November 2014. \n ", "2 \n \nfor approving and ratifying project documents. Furthermore, a limited pool of qualified experts in \nthe market, including project managers, procurement and financial management specialists, and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  experts,  is  a  major  factor  contributing  to  weak  or \nunderperforming project implementation units. To address these issues, the government has \nbeen taking specific actions.5 \n \n7.  Through  several  TA  projects  implemented  during  2000\u20132008,6 ADB  supported  the \ngovernment  in  strengthening  its  institutional  capacity  for  planning  and  managing  public \ninvestment programs, managing and monitoring externally assisted projects, and results M&E of \ncountry development programs at national and regional levels. While the operational framework \nremains  in  place,  the  capacity  to  introduce  good  practice  and  deliver  on  responsibilities, \ndeveloped under these TA projects, has declined because of instability caused by the 2005 and \n2010 political crises, frequent changes of government, and limited capacity in government \nagencies. \n \n8.  Although the efforts of ADB and development partners at various levels will continue to \nimprove  the  government  capacity  to  implement  externally  funded  projects,  a  systematic \napproach is needed for sustainable results in building capacity more effectively at the national \nlevel.7 Drawing on the lessons of previous capacity development activities and considering \ncurrent constraints, further support is required to (i) pursue a long-term solution for the systemic \nissues; (ii) institutionalize training in project management; and (iii) ensure sustainability of the \nguidelines, mechanisms, and training facilities and services developed. There is a need for an \nanalytical  study  or  mapping  of  the  national  construction  industry  that  will  facilitate  the \ngovernment efforts to address the sector issues through effective reforms. Consequently, this \nTA project is seen as an initial phase of a longer-term program of capacity development support \nin sustainable project management. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  impact  will  be  improved  governance  and  implementation  effectiveness  of \ndevelopment projects in key sectors.8 The outcome will be strengthened government capacity \nfor managing development projects. \n                                                \n5  Progress review of the agreed actions was discussed during the annual portfolio review conducted in October \n2014. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported that the majority of the actions are still in progress and require long-\nterm solutions and continuous support for international best practices. \n6  ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n7  The Capacity Building in Public Financial Management Project financed through a multi-donor trust fund has \nprovided short-term consultants to help the MOF in improving public investment policy and procedures. Also, the \nPrime Minister\u2019s Office is being supported by the Swiss Embassy to develop an aid coordination database, and by \nan ADB consultant to assist with the monitoring of the National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013\u20132017. A \nlong-term international procurement consultant has been posted to the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to provide \nproject-specific procurement support under ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Improving the Implementation of \nEnvironmental Safeguards in Central and West Asia. Manila. The World Bank approved a $500,000 grant project \nto support the government in establishing a certified training program in public procurement. \n8  The TA will initially focus on the infrastructure and education sectors and expand to other sectors as time, capacity, \nand resources permit. \n ", "  3 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will support the outcome through the following four outputs: \n \n11.  Output 1: Policy guidelines and procedures for managing development projects \nimproved.  The  TA  will  develop  the  government  guidelines  for  development  project \nmanagement (GDPM), which will explain the main principles and operational procedures for \nmanaging development projects and provide clear guidance on the policies, processes, and \nmechanisms. It will contain appropriately detailed instructions and references to the national and \ninternational requirements to minimize conflicting interpretations.9 The GDPM will streamline \nexisting  procedures  and  make  available  practical  templates  and  methodologies,  where \napplicable, in all areas of the project cycle. In addition, it is expected that the GDPM will set the \nconcepts  for  efficient  use  of  institutional  capacity  and  resources  by  optimizing  roles  and \nresponsibilities of the government bodies involved in project planning, preparation, approval, \nimplementation, monitoring, and result assessments. Upon approval by the government for its \nmandatory use, the GDPM will be converted to an electronic form and maintained by the Public \nInvestment and Technical Assistance Department (PITAD) of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on \nthe  ministry\u2019s  official  website.  Capacity  development  activities  for  representatives  from  the \nPrime  Minister\u2019s  Office,  MOF,  and  other  key  agencies  involved  in  policy  making,  and \nimplementation of the development project management processes and procedures, will include \na study tour abroad to learn about good project management practices and experiences in other \ncountries.10 \n \n12.  Output 2: A sustainable training program for project management introduced to \nthe Training Center of the Ministry of Finance. This output will help the government to \nestablish a specialized training program for project management professionals and practitioners. \nThe training program will be based on the government-approved GDPM and international and \nnational  best  practices.  It  will  include  training curricula  and  learning materials for  different \naspects of project management functions included in the GDPM. However, where necessary, \nmore  detailed  and  intensive  programs  will  be  developed  for  key  elements  of  project \nmanagement such as project appraisal, project financial management and audit, international \nprocurement, and safeguards. Needs and market assessment will be conducted to identify \nwider audiences that will benefit from the certified training courses. The Training Center has \nbeen identified as the most appropriate training institution to develop and implement this training \nprogram  on  a  sustainable  basis.11 The  Training  Center  will  be  supported  in  planning  and \nconducting regular training in 2015\u20132016 on a contractual basis. \n                                                \n9  The requirements will include project planning, budgeting, results M&E, procurement, environmental and social \nsafeguards, gender, governance, and other essential elements for effective project management. The TA activities \nwill be closely coordinated with other capacity development activities of ADB (footnote 13) to supplement the \nefforts and reinforce the outputs for sustainable results. The guidelines will meet international good practices and \nsupport key principles harmonized among the multilateral development banks. \n10 The location for the study tour will be identified during the TA implementation among ADB developing member \ncountries based on the existence of a well-established country system for managing and monitoring donor-funded \nprojects. Participants should be key government officials who can directly support the mainstreaming of the TA \noutputs and introduction of the GDPM. \n11 The TA fact finding reviewed the business plan, assessed the capacity of the Training Center, and reviewed \ncurrent support provided by other development partners. The Training Center has a newly refurbished training \nfacility with substantial capacity for multiple simultaneous training and conducts various training programs for \ngovernment  officials  and  the  general  public  on  the  public  financial  management  subjects,  including  public \nprocurement. The Training Center will gradually adopt certification courses on a fee basis to cover training costs \nand maintain high quality and relevance of the training modules and materials. \n ", "4 \n \n \n13.  Output 3. National capacity for project management and monitoring improved. \nBased on outputs 1 and 2, the Training Center will launch a new training program containing \ncertification courses to improve the practical knowledge and skills in both the public and private \nsectors for various aspects of development project management. In addition to government \nagencies, the private sector and civil society organizations directly involved or interested in \nproject management; other institutions; and authorities with policy making, supervisory, and \naudit responsibilities will be able to strengthen their  capacity and understanding of project \nmanagement.12 The TA will also support on-the-job training and a training-of-trainers program \nfor PITAD and Training Center staff before the launch of the program. Where feasible, other \ncapacity development interventions relevant to project management training available under \nother funding sources will be integrated into the overall training plan of the Training Center and \nextended as capacity, time, and resources permit. 13 \n \n14.  Output 4. Knowledge products for developing the local supply market capacity. \nThe TA will fund 1\u20132 knowledge products to support the government in  (i) assessing the \ncapacity of the national construction industry and local contractors, suppliers, and consultants \n(engineering design and project supervision service providers); and (ii) identifying a medium- to \nlong-term  plan  for  construction  sector  development.  Mapping  and  scoping  the  national \nconstruction industry can provide a deeper understanding of current policies and practices in the \nindustry, including regulating technical standards and registration and licensing of construction \ncompanies and engineering firms. The knowledge product studies will be based on local market \nsurveys, literature review of the national legislation, and data analysis of the investment projects \nsince 2004. The results will be discussed at the consultation workshops among the government \nand other interested stakeholder groups. \n \n15.  It is assumed that the government remains committed to reforming the public sector and \ninstitutionalizing and mainstreaming the TA outputs, and that it will provide timely feedback on \nthe knowledge product studies. Instability of the government and its institutional structures due \nto changes in leadership will pose a major risk to the timely and effective implementation of the \nTA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $631,600, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind \ncontributions, equivalent to 5% of the TA cost. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, from January 2015 to December 2017. The \nMOF  will  be  the  executing  agency. The TA  will  be  administered  by ADB  and  will  not  be \n                                                \n12 It includes staff from the different tiers of the state such as offices of President, Parliament, and Prime Minister; \nChamber of Accounts; General Prosecutors\u2019 Office; Ministry of Justice; and judges. \n13 For example: ADB. 2009.

The MOF will assign the TA coordinator (a dedicated \ncounterpart staff member from PITAD) to support implementation of the TA, and integrate the \nTA  outputs  into  the  government\u2019s  internal  systems.  The  Training  Center  will  also  assign \ncounterpart staff for coordinating its activities with those of PITAD for outputs 2 and 3. \n \n18.  The estimated international consulting input is 12 person-months and national consulting \ninput is 48 person-months. The following consulting inputs will be required on an intermittent \nbasis  to  provide  tasks  identified  in  the  outline  TOR  (Appendix  3):  international  project \nmanagement  and  institutional  development  specialist  (7  person-months),  international  M&E \nspecialist  (2  person-months),  national  regulatory  and  legal  specialist  (6  person-months), \nnational institutional development and training specialist (20 person-months), national project \nmonitoring  and  results  management  specialist  (12  person-months),  and  national  project \nfinancial management specialist (4 person-months). An international firm will be hired through \nquality- and cost-based selection (90:10) with simplified technical proposal to provide project \nimplementation support for outputs 1\u20133. For the knowledge products under output 4, the TA will \nhire individual international consultants (3 person-months) and national consultants (6 person-\nmonths) with skills and expertise relevant to the study topics. Consultants will be engaged by \nADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto  time).14 The TOR for  individual  consultants  will  be  developed  when  the  scope  of  each \nknowledge product is identified during TA implementation. Office equipment and hardware such \nas computers, printers, and  office software will be procured through the shopping method \naccording to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). ADB will \nengage the Training Center of the MOF for the introduction of the certified training program \n(output 3) under the TA through single-source selection.15 The equipment procured will be used \nfor the implementation of the TA and will be handed over to the executing agency upon TA \ncompletion. Disbursements under the TA will be made according to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  The TA achievement will be assessed against the performance targets and deliverables \nindicated  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  Learning  from  the  TA \nimplementation will be documented during the project reviews conducted at least twice a year. \nThe TA reports, review documentation, and knowledge products will be made available to the \npublic on ADB\u2019s website. Good practices and lessons learned will be disseminated through the \nTA completion report and operations communities of practice. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for Strengthening Government Capacity for Managing \nDevelopment Projects, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14 Consulting  services  under  the  TA  will  be  engaged  through  output-based  (lump-sum)  contracts  to  reduce \nadministrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money. \n15 Training Center staff salaries will not be paid from the contract financed under the TA. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and   \n  Performance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved  Average success rate for ADB- ADB project  Government remains \ngovernance and  financed infrastructure and  completion reports  committed to \nimplementation  education projects improved  and post-evaluation  reforming the public \neffectiveness of  from 77.8% in 2013 to 85.0% in  results reports of  sector towards \ndevelopment  2020  Independent  achieving good \nprojects in key  Evaluation  governance and \nsectors   Department  implementation \n    efficiency \n     \nRisk \nInstability of the \ngovernment and \ninstitutional structures \nbecause of changes \nin leadership reduces \neffectiveness of the \nTA outcome \nOutcome      Assumption \nStrengthened  CPA rating on portfolio  ADB report on CPA  Government remains \ngovernment  performance improved to 4.0 or  2018  committed to \ncapacity for  higher in 2018 (2013 baseline:  institutionalize and \nmanaging  3.0)  mainstream the TA \ndevelopment      outputs into its public \nprojects      financial management \nand administrative \nsystems \nOutputs       \n1.
