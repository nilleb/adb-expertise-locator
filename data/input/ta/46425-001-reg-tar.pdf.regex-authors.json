INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) is designed to develop government support and risk \nmanagement frameworks for public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), and will complement the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) existing support programs for PPPs in Southeast Asia, which \nfocus on project preparation.1 ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 identifies private sector development as a \nkey  driver  of  change  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.2 PPPs  are  seen  as  an important  means of \nachieving this objective, and are supported by the ADB PPP operational plan, 2012\u20132020, \nwhich was endorsed by ADB Management in March 2012.3 The objective of creating enabling \nenvironments for PPPs is being incorporated in all country partnership strategies prepared by \nADB. The design and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Infrastructure. Infrastructure investment is critical for economic growth, but existing \nlevels of investment are insufficient, with at least $8 trillion of infrastructure investment required \nin Asia and the Pacific until 2020. The unmet demand has serious consequences for regional \nproductivity and the achievement of sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction, and \nthe  meeting  of  Millennium  Development  Goal  targets.  Available  public  sector  funding  is \ninadequate, and PPPs are seen as an important way to bridge the gap. PPPs have the potential \nto provide an important means of leveraging private investment from both domestic and foreign \nsources. PPPs are also viewed as a means to improve efficiency and service delivery to citizens \nand gain access to new capital, technology, and skills.  \n \n3.  Enabling environment. Enabling environments for PPPs in Southeast Asia have been \nweak. Despite concerted efforts by ADB and many other development partners to promote the \nconcept  of  PPPs  through  numerous  advocacy  and  training  activities,  the  number  of  PPP \ntransactions  beyond  the  energy  sector  has  been  limited,  indicating  that  the  business \nenvironment in Southeast Asia has not been conducive for PPPs. Constraints result in public \nsector officials being unaware of the importance of PPPs, and the private sector less attracted \nto engage in such partnerships. These weaknesses are exacerbated by the lack of supportive \npolicy, legal, and regulatory frameworks for PPPs, and the lack of government capacity to \nmanage  PPP  processes  and  information.  Global  experience  indicates  that  ensuring  equal \nopportunity for private sector participation and engaging in broad-based institutional reforms are \ncritical  to  developing successful  PPPs. The  PPP  operational  plan  identifies four  pillars:  (i) \nadvocacy  and  development;  (ii) strengthening  the  enabling  environment;  (iii)  project \ndevelopment; and (iv) project financing. \n \n4.  Systemic issues. Successful PPP programs need to address multiple systemic issues: \n(i) ensuring equal opportunity, particularly with respect to concerns regarding bid transparency \nand  competition  from  state-owned  enterprises  that  have  access  to  state-directed  and/or \npreferential financing, which can then unfairly compete against private firms; (ii) the need to \ncreate  capacity  within  governments  to  prepare  projects  that  are  economically  sound  and \ntechnically feasible; (iii) the ability of the government to provide project support in the form of \nviability gap payments to create bankable projects for PPPs, given uncertainties in government \ncommitment to address the underlying issues of low tariffs and willingness-to-pay (particularly in \nthe transport and water supply sectors); and (iv) the need to mitigate the private sector\u2019s \n                                                \n1  Vice-President, Operations 2 approved the TA concept paper on 12 November 2012. \n2  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 October 2012.  \n ", "2   \nperception that investing in infrastructure projects entails excessive risk, due to factors such as \nlengthy  government  approval  procedures,  and  uncertainty  about  the  creditworthiness  of \ngovernment contracting agencies. Resolution of each of these issues requires a different form of \nassistance. \n \n5.  ADB support. Assistance takes time to implement and needs to be delivered through a \nphased  program.  ADB  has  provided  loan  and  grant-financed  assistance  to  a  number  of \ngovernments in the region to support PPPs, including: (i) Indonesia and the Philippines to \nstrengthen capacity to prepare PPP projects, (ii) Thailand to develop a PPP policy and PPP \ncapacity  in  the  health  sector;  (iii)  Cambodia  to  develop  a  policy,  legal,  regulatory  and \ninstitutional framework for PPPs; and (iv) the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, to develop \nPPPs in the health and education sectors. Public sector projects are exploring the use of PPPs \nas a potential procurement  approach in the power, transport, water, education and health \nsectors. While these initiatives have been important, to date the most significant level of support \nfor PPPs provided by ADB in Southeast Asia has been directed toward establishing project \ndevelopment facilities in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam (in progress).5 The facilities \nare typically administered by planning agencies and are concerned with the review of existing \nlaws  and  regulations  (para  4,  [i]  and [ii])  and preparation  of projects  (para  4, [iii]). These \ninitiatives have been critical initial steps in developing a PPP project pipeline, but to make \nprojects  bankable,  they  will  often  require  government  support  in  the  form  of  viability  gap \npayments (i.e., output payments and capital grants), and payment guarantees. This support is \nsourced from ministries of finance (MOFs), and these agencies require specialist tools and \naccess to advisers to appraise different forms of support to identify requirements to make \nprojects bankable. In addition, MOFs need to conduct value-for-money analyses to ensure that \nproject assistance is efficient, effective, and sustainable, relative to other procurement options, \nand is affordable for the government and users.  \n \n6.  Risk management. The provision by the government of direct or contingent forms of \nfiscal support to projects creates risks. MOFs need to develop capacity to manage those risks \non both project and portfolio bases. Typically the debt management office in each MOF will be \nresponsible for managing those risks, although in some countries, such as Indonesia,  risk \nmanagement  units  (RMUs)  have  been  established  for  this  purpose.  These  units  require \nspecialists to advise on the structure and functions of their operations, develop risk assessment \nmethodologies for projects, value contingent liabilities, establish claim review and payment \nmechanisms, manage and report on the total portfolio of fiscal obligations and risks, and identify \nthe appropriate levels and forms of staff and finance needed to support their operations.  \n \n7.  Capacity development. Capacity needs vary across countries in Southeast Asia. While \nthese government support and risk management structures and methodologies will primarily be \napplied by MOFs, their requirements will vary across countries as capability varies significantly \nacross the region. Broad-based assistance within countries is also needed, because RMUs can \nonly be used in the context of governments\u2019 overall planning, budgeting, procuring, financing, \naccounting, reporting and audit arrangements. As a result, the TA outputs will be developed in \nconsultation  with  representatives  from  other  government  agencies  such  as  inter-ministerial \ncoordinating committees,  planning  agencies,  central  banks,  and  line  agencies,  and  will  be \ndesigned to complement existing PPP initiatives. The TA will draw on good practices and \nlessons from across the region, and create a systematic knowledge platform that can be used to \n                                                \n5  Project  Development  Facilities  have been  established under  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development \nProgram Loan (2006) in Indonesia, a TA for Strengthening Public Private Partnerships in the Philippines (2011), \nand a Public Private Partnership Support Project (2012) in Viet Nam. \n ", "  3 \naddress gaps in PPP frameworks and respond to specific problems and requests for assistance \nin a consistent manner. In this way, the TA will leverage existing PPP activities and provide \nincremental and additional benefits by creating outputs that will lead to enhanced awareness \nand knowledge sharing of these critical issues. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be increased use of PPPs to develop infrastructure in Southeast Asia. \nThe outcome will be an improved enabling environment for development of PPPs in Southeast \nAsia.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  TA  will  achieve  its  outcome  through  the  provision  of  TA  to  governments  in \nSoutheast Asia, with a primary focus on Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam.6 These funds will \nbe used to develop sound PPP project development structures, processes, government support \nmechanisms, and risk management arrangements that can be replicated across the region \nthough knowledge sharing by provision of examples of international best practice. The TA \noutputs are as follows: \n(i)  Government support and risk management frameworks for public\u2013private \npartnership projects developed. The TA consultants will work on a selective \nbasis with MOFs and other agencies to help develop frameworks in each country \nfor providing government support to projects and managing associated risks. The \nproject frameworks will be used to facilitate the development of PPPs by clearly \ndefining processes over the project lifecycle that coordinate project development, \nassessment of alternative procurement options, and management of the projects \nin the implementation phase. The frameworks will help define the institutional \narrangements for reviewing government support and risk mitigation requirements, \nproject review points, and project evaluation methodologies required to support \nthe appraisal, issuance, and management of government support mechanisms \nsuch  as  direct  fiscal  viability  gap  payments  and  use  of  guarantees,  so  that \nprojects generate value for money, are bankable, and affordable to users and the \ngovernment. Reports will be prepared for each selected country setting out that \ncountry\u2019s requirements. \n(ii)  Government risk management frameworks for portfolios of public\u2013private \npartnership projects developed. The TA consultants will work on a selective \nbasis with MOFs and other agencies to help develop frameworks in each country \nfor managing actual and contingent PPP liabilities from a portfolio perspective by \nquantifying actual and contingent liabilities, quantifying guarantee fees, making \nadequate  financial  provisions  for  risks,  identifying  claim  and  payment \nrequirements,  ensuring  the  risks  are  adequately  financed,  and  identifying \naccounting  and  reporting  arrangements  to  ensure  PPP  risks  are  being \ntransparently  and  sustainably  managed.  Reports  will  be  prepared  for  each \nselected country setting out that country\u2019s requirements. \n(iii)  Priority public\u2013private partnership projects requiring government support \nidentified and reviewed. The TA consultants will work on a selective basis with \n                                                \n6  If required, assistance may be provided on a selective basis to develop government support and risk management \nframeworks in Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, and Myanmar.  \n ", "4   \nMOFs and other government agencies to provide initial screening of the projects \nbeing developed under complementary areas of ADB support such as project \ndevelopment facilities, and identify the types and forms of government support \nthat can potentially be provided to projects that meet the criteria of value for \nmoney, affordability to users and the government, and bankability. Reports will \nbe  prepared  that  demonstrate  the  viability  of  key  projects  under  different \ngovernment support and risk allocation scenarios, and identify critical issues that \nneed to be managed during the project preparation and implementation phases. \n(iv)  Improved  capacity  of  governments  to  issue  and  manage  government \nsupport  requirements and  their  associated risks. The TA consultants will \nwork on a selective basis with MOFs to assess their capacity to appraise PPP \nprojects and manage portfolios of risks. In the light of these findings, the TA will \nwork with MOFs to help define organization requirements for RMUs, and identify \nstaff and financial resources needed to manage the associated risks. \n(v)  Improved  awareness  of  government  support  and  risk  management \nknowledge  products  through  dissemination  and  consensus  building \nactivities.  The  TA  will  provide  operational  and  knowledge  support  to \ngovernments in Southeast Asia on the need for government support and risk \nmanagement  frameworks  for  PPP  projects  and  programs,  and  examples  of \ninternational best practice. This support will be designed to reflect the specific \nneeds of each country and provide a common framework to share experience, \nlessons, good practices and knowledge products across countries, rather than \napplying a standard \u2015one-size-fits-all\u2016 approach for each country. Based on this \nsupport,  a  common  understanding  can  be  developed  across  countries  on \napproaches to identify priority projects, and assess the policy and institutional \nimplications, and financing requirements. The TA will facilitate the achievement \nof  a  consensus  among  government  agencies  and  development  partners  on \nrequirements to support the PPP program. The TA will seek to obtain support \nfrom  other  development  agencies  to  facilitate  implementation  and \noperationalization of the government support and risk management frameworks \ndeveloped in each country in the region. \n \n10.  The following assumptions are critical to the success of the TA: (i) PPPs continue to be \nrecognized by developing member countries in Southeast Asia as an important mechanism for \nenhancing economic growth and reducing poverty by mobilizing private finance to bridge the \ninfrastructure gap; (ii) the national policies and institutional arrangements will be supportive, and \nfacilitate the implementation of the proposed assistance; and (iii) project pipelines for PPPs will \nbe robust over time. The major risks are: (i) a global economic downturn that could lead to a \npolicy shift to reduce infrastructure development plans, or focus on the use of more traditional \nforms of infrastructure procurement; (ii) lack of participation in or understanding of the need for \neffective  forms  of  government  support  and  risk  management  capacity  for  PPPs  by  some \ncountries could hamper efforts to develop consensus on key issues; and (iii) inadequate ability \nby the TA to produce timely outputs of high quality needed for effective decision making and \nachievement of consensus among the various government agencies and development partners. \nDetails of the methodology and activities are presented in the design and monitoring framework \npresented in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Details of the cost estimates \nand the financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented by the Southeast Asia \nPublic Management, Financial Sector and Trade Division. ADB will build on existing programs of \nassistance supporting the development of PPPs. The TA will also draw upon work currently \nbeing  developed  by  ADB  on  issues  such  as  use  of  viability  gap  funds,  and  the  national \ninfrastructure  information  systems  platform  being  developed  by  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and \nSustainable Development Department. \n \n13.  The Southeast Asia Public Management, Financial Sector and Trade Division will assign \none or two international staff members to supervise the overall implementation of the TA, with \nsupport  from  national  and  administrative  staff.  It  is  estimated  that  43  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services and 45 person-months of national consulting services will be \nrequired for the TA. Due to the diverse requirements of each country and the need for a phased \napproach, a team of consultants will be engaged through a firm (package A), supported by a \nteam of individual consultants (package B), in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The firm will be engaged using quality- and \ncost-based selection based on simplified technical proposals. The outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are presented in Appendix 3. Purchases of equipment (computer hardware and \nsoftware)  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). The equipment will be turned over to member countries upon TA \ncompletion.  Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n14.  The TA will start in January 2013 and be completed by September 2014. During this \nperiod,  the  consultants  will  (i)  develop  a  generic  methodology  and  financial  model  that \ngovernments can use for appraising government support and risk mitigation requirements for \nspecific PPP projects that is based on value for money, affordability, bankability, and associated \nrisks for PPP projects; (ii) develop a generic methodology and financial model that governments \ncan  use  for  valuing  and  managing  actual  and  contingent  PPP  liabilities  from  a  portfolio \nperspective;  (iii) prepare  diagnostic  assessments  of  current  policy,  legal,  regulatory  and \ninstitutional arrangements and capacity to provide government support and risk management \nservices  and  relationships  with  other  agencies  involved  in  developing  PPPs  in  the  target \ncountries; (iv) prepare case studies on how the methodologies are applied to individual projects \nand  countries;  (v)  advise  on  required  changes  to  policy,  legal,  regulatory  and  institutional \narrangements to establish government support and risk management mechanisms such as \nRMUs in each country; (vi) prepare reports that document the government support and risk \nmanagement frameworks; and (vii) hold workshops to disseminate the project outputs.  \n \nIV.
