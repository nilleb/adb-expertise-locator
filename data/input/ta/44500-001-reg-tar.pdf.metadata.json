INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) stems from the need for developing countries to \nimprove public sector management (PSM) so that they can better manage their economies and \ndeliver public services more efficiently and effectively. The TA is anchored on two core concepts \nthat affect the quality of development work of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Asia and \nthe Pacific: (i) good governance, including effective PSM, and (ii) knowledge generation and \ndissemination in PSM, and partnership with institutions as part of ADB\u2019s commitment to drivers \nof change in Strategy 2020.1 \n \n2.  With  respect  to  enhancing  knowledge  generation  and  dissemination  in  PSM,  a \npartnership with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) in Singapore is proposed. \nTwo fact-finding missions to Singapore (in September 2010 and May 2011) were undertaken to \nfinalize the project design. The LKYSPP has concurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  costs,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  There are three issues with respect to the application of good governance \n \nA.  Why Focus on Governance and PSM? \n4.  Good  governance\u2014a  concept  that  encompasses  effective  PSM\u2014is  a  quintessential \npublic good needed for market stability and economic development benefiting all people on a \nnonrival  basis.  The  benefits  of  good  governance\u2014and  by  implication  the  costs  of  poor \ngovernance\u2014also accrue to all others interacting with a particular jurisdiction. Governance, thus, \nhas important regional and global dimensions. This necessitates a deep understanding of the \noverarching political economy and governance system in which PSM operates.  \n \nB.  How to Better Generate and Disseminate Knowledge in PSM \n5.  One of the challenges of development is how to access and share knowledge in all \nspheres of development activity, particularly on governance, public policy, and PSM. Many good \npractices in these areas have not been documented or disseminated widely and effectively, thus \nlimiting the scope of learned lessons to better inform public policy and PSM across Asia and the \nPacific. Engaging in collaborative research as a way of enhancing and disseminating knowledge \nis an important way to reduce the knowledge gap on PSM in the region. This, coupled with high-\nprofile events (such as international forums, executive education, and training), will also help in \nprojecting PSM to the forefront of the development agenda in the region.  \n \nC.  How External Partnerships Can Benefit ADB \n6.  The primary issue to be addressed in knowledge generation and dissemination in areas \nassociated with PSM is how external partnerships with relevant institutions can be developed so \nas  to  enable  ADB  to  best  fulfill  its  mandate.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  encourages  external \n                                                 \n \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \n  Manila. http://www.adb.org/strategy2020/ \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website in 17 August 2011. \n ", "2  \nknowledge partnerships and serves as an important context for the TA.3 Strengthening such \npartnerships enables ADB to fulfill one of its major roles as a multilateral development bank\u2014to \npromote learning and innovation to the benefit of developing member countries. Deepening \nresearch  in  priority  areas  of  Strategy  2020  is  an  outcome  indicator  of  ADB\u2019s  Knowledge \nManagement Action Plan. Strategy 2020 also stresses the need to strengthen public sector \ncapacity  and  management  practices  in  priority  sector  areas  that  include  infrastructure, \nenvironment, regional cooperation initiatives, finance, and education.  \n \n7.  What  is  needed  is  a  synergy  between  practice  and  analytics  to  generate  applied \nknowledge on PSM that can be shared regionally. Practice-based knowledge merits wider \ndissemination in a form that is useful to governments, state-owned enterprises, and others to \nhelp inform public policies. Such knowledge products developed and disseminated through a \nreputable knowledge platform can enhance the outreach and impact of these products. \n \nD.  Value-Added Proposition of the Partnership with the Lee Kuan Yew School of \nPublic Policy (LKYSPP) \n8.  To better address these issues, the TA will enable ADB to draw upon the expertise and \nbreadth of reach of a premier academic institution and think tank in Asia\u2014the LKYSPP in \nSingapore.4 The knowledge outputs generated from a partnership with the LKYSPP will not only \nposition ADB at the core of knowledge sharing on PSM in Asia and the Pacific but will also \ninform and frame the public management debate in the region.  \n \n9.  Pursuant to the memorandum of understanding reached between ADB and the LKYSPP \nin October 2009 for this type of knowledge management collaboration,5 it is proposed that ADB \nestablish  a  primary  partnership  with  the  LKYSPP  given  the  very  close  alignment  with  its \nobjective (of raising the standards of governance throughout the region and improving the lives \nof the region\u2019s people) with that of ADB (poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific).6 The \npartnership, however, can be expanded, where relevant, to other noted institutions (footnote 5). \nPartnering with the LKYSPP on PSM-related areas will help showcase ADB as a proactive \nknowledge institution by putting ideas into practice and by emphasizing applied research to \nbetter inform PSM ideas. This will directly help ADB regional departments in their work. \n \n                                                 \n \n3  In July 2009, ADB\u2019s President approved a plan to advance the knowledge management agenda under Strategy \n2020. Organized into four pillars, the plan is designed to (i) sharpen knowledge focus in ADB operations, (ii) \nempower communities of practice, (iii) strengthen external knowledge partnerships, and (iv) further enhance staff \nlearning and skills development.  \n4  While the primary focus of the proposed TA is on the partnership with the LKYSPP, the TA will explore \nopportunities and options to expand and enrich this partnership by including other noted and relevant institutions \nand research think tanks, such as the Asian Development Bank Institute, through participation in the proposed \npublic sector management conference (output 2). Similar partnerships with ADB are in the pipeline for other \nreputed institutions in Asia, including Seoul National University. \n5  In addition, there has been a rich inventory of professional activities already undertaken in partnership between the \nLKYSPP and ADB on issues related to water governance and urban water management, climate change, and \nimproving aid effectiveness. \n6 In 2009, LKYSPP was ranked 7th among 40 top Asian think-tanks, and is the only institution in the top ten that is \ndedicated to work on PSM and public policy. All the others are in areas of international affairs, social sciences, \neconomic research, and strategic studies. This is drawn from the ranking of The Think Tanks and Civil Societies \nProgram of the University of Pennsylvania in 2009 (see The Straits Times. 2010. \u201cFour S\u2019pore think-tanks among \nAsia\u2019s top 30\u201d. January 31). The criteria for ranking include academic reputation, success in generating innovative \npolicy ideas, and access to elites in the areas of policymaking, media, and academia. As is clear, on public policy \nand PSM, LKYSPP is the most credible institution in Asia, hence its appeal for purposes of this project. \n ", "  3\n10.  The relationship with the LKYSPP will be valuable to ADB as: (i) the LKYSPP offers ADB \nthe opportunity to reach out extensively to high-level officials in countries in Asia who are its \nalumni (the school trains nearly 2,000 public officials every year in key areas of financial reforms, \npublic management reform, urban planning, and public\u2013private partnerships); (ii) the School\u2019s \nfaculty has scholars and practitioners from all over the world who can help bridge ideas in \nresearch to the practical application of knowledge in development undertakings, particularly in \nAsia, and many have had professional experience with the World Bank, International Monetary \nFund, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and ADB; (iii) the School\u2019s \nfour  well-regarded  specialized  research  institutions  will  allow  ADB  to  draw  on  specialized \nexpertise;7 and (iv) the School has also networked extensively with other reputable institutions \nof higher learning and research in Asia and around the world.8 ADB can tap into the knowledge \nbase of these partnerships, thus considerably expanding its outreach. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be reflected in better-informed PSM policies, programs, and practitioners \nin the developing member countries of Asia and the Pacific. This is expected to result from \ninspired  leadership,  managed  transformation,  and  leveraged  learning  opportunities.  The \noutcome will be knowledge generation and dissemination of good practice in public policy and \nPSM related to ADB operations. The focus of the TA outcome will be on the sustenance of a \nlong-term relationship between ADB and the LKYSPP which enables the LKYSPP to continue, \nand to catalyze, knowledge generation and dissemination in public policy in PSM-related areas, \nincluding partnering with other reputable knowledge institutions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The area of coverage will be region-wide since all ADB\u2019s developing member countries \ncan potentially benefit from the ADB\u2013LKYSPP partnership. Specific TA outputs will include the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Research products in public policy and PSM. Basing the research \nagenda on both operational and policy-focused research, these products will \ninclude practice-based research reports, policy briefs, and assessments so as to \ninform the policy debate on areas of operations that ADB\u2019s regional departments \nare involved in. The research products (while country specific) will be placed in \nthe regional context based primarily on the political economy, and drawn from \nacross a variety of sectors covering ADB\u2019s priority areas of focus. ADB will \nprioritize topics related to (a) public financial management; (b) public\u2013private \npartnerships, especially municipal finance for infrastructure; (c) PSM at sector \nlevel; and (d) decentralization.9 The research methodology will include literature \n                                                 \n \n7 These institutions are (i) the Asia Competitiveness Institute, which studies ways to boost the region\u2019s productivity; \n(ii) Centre on Asia and Globalization, which examines the impact of globalization on Asia and Asia\u2019s role in global \ngovernance; (iii) Institute of Policy Studies, which focuses on Singapore\u2019s own policies; and (iv) Institute of Water \nPolicy, which looks at comparative management, conservation, and use of water. \n8  Including University of Tokyo, Tsinghua University (Beijing), London School of Economics, and Harvard University. \n9 The topics that have been specified build upon the work that ADB has already done in these areas and keeping in \nview the work as suggested by the regional departments. In particular, research topics that have been confirmed \nare (i) public roles of the private sector (public\u2013private partnerships) in India, (ii) innovations in subnational \nfinancing mechanisms and tools, (iii) designing an equitable and sustainable framework for natural resource \n ", "4  \nreviews, field visit studies (where relevant), surveys, and comparative studies.10 \nADB  staff  from  regional  departments  and  the  Governance  and  Public \nManagement Community of Practice (CoP) will participate in the broad research \nagenda through reviews to ensure practice-based research. \n(ii)  Output 2: Public policy and PSM conference and associated forums and \nworkshops. The conference and associated forums and workshops will focus on \nensuring that knowledge dissemination also takes place through face-to-face \ninteraction such that researchers as well as practitioners from across the region \ncan share and analyze knowledge gained under output 1. The conference topics, \nto be finalized later in consultation with the LKYSPP, but in ADB\u2019s areas of \npriority,  will  include  (a)  overall  PSM  in  developing  member  countries  in  the \nmacroeconomic  context,  (b)  subnational  finance  and  decentralization  as  it \nimpacts economic growth and delivery of essential public services, and (c) public \nfinancial management as a fundamental challenge to public sector and sector \ngovernance reforms. \n(iii)  Output 3: Training for developing member country officials on policies of \nsubnational financing. The LKYSPP\u2019s comparative advantage of being one of \nthe region\u2019s leaders in executive education\u2014as well as existent expertise in \nfinancing, public\u2013private partnerships, etc.\u2014will be used to impart practice-based \ntraining to developing member country officials in public policy of subnational \nfinancing, including (a) strengthening the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system, \n(b) evaluating options for municipal financing such as through local bond markets, \nand (c) enhancing the role of the private sector in resource pooling, e.g., for \ninfrastructure financing. \n \n13.  There  are  no  risks  in  the  TA  related  to  social  and  environmental  concerns,  public \nfinancial management, procurement, or corruption. Other risks related to the TA are detailed in \nthe design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) but one that merits mention is the lack of \npractical application of the research products and conference. The TA design has incorporated \nrelevant risk mitigation measures through ADB staff reviews to account for this risk. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) for $500,000. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the proposed TA. Project administration will be \nmanaged by the team leaders with active assistance from a project coordinator (an individual \nnational  consultant  funded  by  the  TA  and  contracted  for  9  person-months  [PMs]  on  an \nintermittent basis). A project steering committee representing the CoP at ADB (comprising the \n                                                                                                                                                          \n \nmanagement in Mongolia, (iv) managing land acquisition for national infrastructure projects in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, (v) impact of micro finance on poverty in Pakistan, and (vi) Indonesia\u2019s fiscal decentralization \nand devolution of land and property taxes. There is some flexibility in accommodating additional topics to capitalize \non upcoming topical developments for which regional departments require analytical work. \n10  The specific nature of the appropriate research methodology will vary by subject area. However, given the fact that \nADB has considerable knowledge of the practice of public management and its various domains, the knowledge \ngap in policy and analytical implications is expected to be filled by researchers at the LKYSPP.  \n ", "  5\ntwo  co-chairs)  and  the  vice-dean  (academic  affairs)  at  the  LKYSPP  will  provide  strategic \nguidance.11 The steering committee will meet bi-annually, or as needed. The TA duration will be \nfrom October 2011 to October 2013.  \n \n16.  The LKYSPP will provide the venue for the proposed PSM conference, help frame topics \nand issues of the conference in collaboration with the Governance and Public Management CoP, \nand contribute research papers that will document empirical, conceptual, and practical issues \nacross a wide range of public management concerns relevant for developing Asia. The LKYSPP \nwill also provide inputs for the conference website to be established at ADB. Peer review of the \nresearch papers and the conference proceedings will be done by individual experts selected by \nADB. Sector experts drawn from regional departments and the CoP will provide quality control \nby reviewing the research products and by providing inputs relevant to their sectors (especially \nwith respect to the operational aspects of the research papers). \n \n17.  While  there  will  be  one  letter  of  agreement  with  the  LKYSPP  for  purposes  of  this \npartnership, for the delivery of outputs there will be two specific contracts, both time-based and \nby single-source selection.12 The LKYSPP will be responsible for three specific outputs: (i) \ndeveloping and piloting a subnational financing module through its Executive Education unit; (ii) \nproducing research outputs in specific subject areas (see footnote 9); and (iii) organizing the \nPSM conference which builds on the research work. The first contract (for $100,000) will be for \nthe training, and the second (for $200,000) will be in equal amounts for the research and the \nconference. In addition to the TA project coordinator, an international individual advisor and \nSingapore-based event managers13 for the PSM conference will also be contracted under the \nTA for 1 PM and 6 PMs respectively. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Their \nterms of reference are in Appendix 3. Disbursement under the TA will be made in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n18.  Good practices and lessons from the TA will be disseminated through (i) the PSM \nconference, which will showcase substantive research products; (ii) the regular publication of \nresearch products in top internationally refereed journals; (iii) the LKYSPP and ADB websites; \nand (iv) incorporation of TA products in LKYSPP training and course modules. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nCollaborative  Research  and  Advisory  Services  on  Public  Sector  Management,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n \n11 The justification for placing the proposed TA within the ambit of the Governance and Public Management CoP is \nthat knowledge generation and dissemination cuts across regional departments, and also that it incorporates the \ndiversity of expertise that individual members of the CoP currently possess. \n12 It is proposed that the LKYSPP be selected on a single-source basis given the nature of services to be provided, \nand given its substantive credibility on development research in Asia. It also has prior association with ADB which \naccords it a comparative advantage over other research institutions (para. 10). \n13 The event managers are proposed to be from Singapore so that country-specific knowledge will enable transaction \ncosts of organizing the conference to be lower for the TA.
