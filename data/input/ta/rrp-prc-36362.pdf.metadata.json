An initial environmental examination was undertaken, \nAssessment  and  the  findings  are  summarized  in  the  summary  initial \nenvironmental examination attached as Appendix 8. \n   \nProject Description  The Project covers six cities in Liaoning province and consists of \nthe following: (i) coal bed methane (CBM) and coal mine methane \n(CMM) development and utilization  in Fuxin; (ii) gas distribution \nimprovement in Benxi and Fushun; (iii) improvement of city central \nheating supply in  Anshan, Benxi, Liaoyang, and Yingkou; and \n(iv) institutional reforms and corporate governance improvement for \nall  project  implementing  agencies.  Policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment  during  project  processing  has  focused  on: \n(i) maximizing benefits to the poor and ensuring that the poor \nhave sufficient heating by establishing specific gas and heating \nassistance programs, (ii) implementing market-based heating tariff \nreforms  and  improving  billing  collection  in  project  cities,  and \n(iii) promoting private sector participation. \n   \nRationale  Methane, part of natural coal composition, is released into the \natmosphere from coal mine operations. It is estimated that the \ncoal mines in Liaoning released about 1.2 billion cubic meters (m3) \nof methane into the atmosphere in 2003, a figure expected to \nreach 2.0 billion m3 by 2010. Methane, when released into the \natmosphere, is about 21 times more potent as a greenhouse gas \nthan carbon dioxide (CO ). In addition, coal mine safety is a major \n2\nconcern in the PRC, which reported deaths of 6,900 miners in \n2002. Part A of the Project is designed to utilize CBM/CMM to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve coal mine safety. \nThe gas distribution systems in the cities of Fushun and Benxi are \nold  and  inefficient  with  high  distribution  losses.  They  are \ndangerous  because  the  pipelines  are  aged  and  often  cause \nexplosions. To address these problems, Part B of the Project will \nrehabilitate gas distribution systems to reduce line losses, improve \noperational safety, and supply gas to additional households to \nhelp  reduce  coal  consumption  in  Fushun  and  Benxi.  Urban \nenvironmental problems have been a major concern in Liaoning \nas a great majority of urban residents rely on coal-fired small, \ninefficient, and polluting boilers for their heat supply. Part C of the \nProject will improve environmental quality in four cities (Anshan, \nBenxi,  Liaoyang, and Yingkou) by building efficient  and large  \n ", "iv \n \n  boilers to facilitate closing the 412 existing small coal-fired boilers \nin Benxi, Liaoyang, and Yingkou. Part D of the Project includes \n(i) institutional  strengthening  and  training  for  implementing  the \ninstitutional  and  financial  reform  action  plans  prepared  by  the \nproject preparatory technical assistance consultants,  (ii) assistance \nto the four project implementing agencies (PIAs) to implement the \nheating tariff reforms, and (iii) development of options for private \nsector participation. Overall, the Project is consistent with Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) operational strategy in the PRC, and \nwill support the government of Liaoning province (GLP) in aiming \nto improve environmental quality and coal mine safety, and to \nensure that the poor have sufficient gas and central heating. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The long-term goal of the Project is to support environmental \nimprovement in Liaoning. The main objectives of the Project are: \n(i) improvement  in  efficiency  and  reliability  of  gas  and  central \nheating  supply  and  closure  of  small  coal-fired  boilers,  and \n(ii) CMM  and  CBM  production  and  commercial  utilization.  The \nProject includes the following components: Part A: CBM/CMM \ndevelopment; Part B: gas distribution improvement; Part C: city \ncentral  heating  supply,  and  Part  D:  institutional  reforms  and \ncorporate governance improvement. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $161.0 million equivalent, \ncomprising a foreign exchange cost of $76.0 million (47%) and a \nlocal currency cost of $85.0 million equivalent (53%). \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will  provide a loan of $70.0 million to finance the foreign \nexchange cost of the Project. The remaining foreign exchange \ncost of $6.0 million will be financed with equity from the PIAs. The \ntotal local costs of $85.0 million equivalent will be financed with \nequity of $54.3 million from the PIAs, and loans of $30.7 million \nfrom local banks. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $70.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nhave a  25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The loan proceeds will be re-lent by the Borrower to GLP through \nTerms  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  under  the  same  terms  and \nconditions. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   ", "v \n \nImplementation  GLP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project.  The \nArrangements  subcomponents will be implemented by seven PIAs. A project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  will  be  responsible  for  managing, \ncoordinating,  and  supervising  implementation  of  project \nsubcomponents. Each PIA will establish a project implementation \noffice  (PIO)  to  undertake  the  direct  responsibility  for  design, \nconstruction, and operation of subprojects. Project implementation \nstarted in August 2004 with the preparation of bidding documents. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Government of Liaoning Province (GLP) \n   \nProcurement  Equipment, materials, and services financed from the proceeds of \nthe  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Items financed with local currency \nfunds by GLP will be procured following local competitive bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Advance procurement action and \nretroactive financing  was requested by GLP and approved by \nADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  12  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n70 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided \nto assist GLP with project implementation, including review of the \ndraft tender documents and evaluation of the bids received, and \nmonitoring and evaluation of the project impact. An additional \n8 person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n30 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided \nfor  implementing  institutional  reforms  and  facilitating \nimplementation of heating tariff reforms. All consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the selection \nand  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  ADB  has  approved \nadvance recruitment and retroactive financing of the consulting \nservices under the Project. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  provide  substantial  environmental  and  health \nBeneficiaries  benefits.  The  environmental  benefits  from  the  Project  include \nexpected coal savings by 217,500 tons per year (t/yr), and the \nemission  reduction  of  total  suspended  particulates  (TSP)  of \n18,800 t/y, sulfur dioxide (SO ) of 2,600 t/y, nitrogen oxides (NOx) \n2\nof  1,700  t/y,  and  greenhouse  gas  of  CO   equivalent  by \n2\n840,900 t/y. Water and soil pollution will be indirectly reduced due \nto lower rates of pollutant transfer from air to water, with reduced \nstress on local ecosystems. The quantifiable local environmental \nbenefits over the project life are expected to be about CNY846 \nmillion in net present value at 2003 prices. In addition, the global \nenvironmental benefits of the greenhouse gas reduction (CO  and \n2\nCBM/CMM)  are  expected  to  be  about  CNY163 million in net \npresent  value  at  2003  prices.  Unquantifiable  environmental \nbenefits, such as reduction in damage from the waste water of \nsmall boilers and gas leaks, are also likely to be significant. \n   ", "vi \n \n  The economic and financial internal rates of return for the whole \nProject  are  satisfactory  at  26.3%  (with  local  environmental \nbenefits)  and  8.7%,  respectively.  The  project\u2019s  poverty  impact \nratio is estimated at 13.9%, higher than the 7.4% poor population \nin the project areas. The Project will create about 7,280 person-\nyears of job opportunities during the project construction phase \nand 1,940 full-time jobs during project operation. Of the total, \n2,910 person-years of job opportunities will be filled by the poor, \nwomen, and minorities with an estimated total of CNY28 million in \nwage payments during the project construction period. In addition, \n780  employment  opportunities  with  CNY8.4  million  of  annual \nwage payments are expected to go to the poor, women, and \nminorities during project operation.  In addition, a total of 90,870 \npoor  households  will  benefit  from  a  discount  on  the  gas  and \nheating supply connection fee (38,900 poor households) and gas \nand heating bills  (51,970 poor households), resulting in annual \nsavings  of  CNY51.87  million  in  connection  fees  and \nCNY28.38 million in discounts on gas and heating bills. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The risk of insufficient heating demand for the Project is minimal \nas the gas and central heating supply under the Project is mainly \nto  meet  existing  demand  and  a  small  fraction  of  incremental \ndemand.  It  is  expected  that  macroeconomic  conditions  will \ncontinue to be sound with continuing political stability in the PRC, \nand  strong  economic  performance  in  Liaoning.  The  gas  and \ncentral  heating  supply  under  the  Project  is  based  on  proven \ndesigns  and  conventional  technologies  that  have  been  long \nsuccessfully used in the PRC; no significant technical risks are \nanticipated.  The  risk  of  the  delay  in  loan  effectiveness  and \nconstruction due to late internal approval and procurement  are \naddressed  by  early  preparation,  timely  submission  of  relevant \ndocuments, and procurement training for all PIAs. The PIAs will \nbe  subject  to  good  governance  supervision  under  the  project \nperformance management system. ADB\u2019s close involvement will \nensure that competent consultants will be recruited on time.  To \nfully assess the potential project risks, a probabilistic risk analysis \nwas  performed  using  the  \u201cMonte  Carlo\u201d  simulation  technique \nbased on 3,000 simulations for the economic and financial internal \nrates of returns  and the poverty impact ratio.  The risk analysis \nconcludes that the Project is robust under future uncertainties and \nthat the risks associated with it are minimal and acceptable, and \nthat the probability for negative outcomes for the poor is also \nminimal. \n \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Liaoning Environmental Improvement Project. \nThe project framework, which outlines the goal, purposes, outputs, activities, and inputs is \npresented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The PRC has severe environmental problems, including air pollution associated with \nrapid economic growth,  heavy reliance on coal as the primary fuel, and  use of obsolete \ntechnology. The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) estimated that since the \nearly 1990s, pollution has resulted in a loss to the PRC economy of approximately 4% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP). Air pollution accounts for 59% of this loss.1 Liaoning province is one of \nthe provinces in the PRC with severe air pollution problems due to its heavy reliance on coal as \nthe primary fuel for its many heavy industries and small coal-fired heating boilers. Before 2002, \nnone  of  the  major  cities  in  Liaoning  met  the  national  air  quality  standards.  Due  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s concerted effort on closing down small and highly polluting heating boilers, the \nurban air quality has been improved in recent years. In 2003, seven of 14 cities in Liaoning met \nthe national air quality standards (Appendix 2). Supplementary Appendix A provides additional \ninformation. \n \n3.  Urban  heating  demand  has  grown  rapidly  due  to  rising  incomes,  privatization  of \nresidential housing, and housing sector growth. As incomes increase, people living in the cold \nnorthern provinces have demanded more and better heating. Central heating in terms of square \nmeters (m2) recorded an annual growth rate of 16.1% between 1992 and 2003. Nationwide, \nresidential buildings account for about 70% of the total space heating, and commercial and \npublic buildings account for the remaining 30%.  Heating demand in Liaoning has also been \ngrowing rapidly during the past decade. In the PRC, over 60 million tons (t) of coal are burned \nby 500,000 small, inefficient, coal-fired heating boilers every year, resulting in the emission of \nsubstantial amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO ), carbon dioxide (CO ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and \n2 2\ntotal suspended particulates (TSP). The majority of urban heating supplies in Liaoning come \nfrom 5,000 of these boilers, creating severe air pollution problems in urban areas. \n \n4.  The PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer. Production of 1,667 million \nt of raw coal in 2003 accounted for about 33.5% of global production. Coal accounts for 95% of \nthe nation's primary fossil energy resources and will continue to be the primary energy fuel for \nthe foreseeable future. Coal production is expected to increase to 1,800 million t in 2004 due to \nthe increased demand for power generation to meet  rapidly growing demand for  power. In \nLiaoning, coal production was 58 million t in 2003 with over 78 active coal mines with capacity \ngreater than 30,000 t per year (t/y). State-owned coal mines account for 80% of coal production \ncapacity. In the PRC, the coal bed methane (CBM)/coal mine methane (CMM) resources that \ncould be produced from coal mines up to a depth of 2,000 meters are estimated at 30 to \n35 trillion cubic meters (m3). \n                                                 \n1   Based on a study by the Policy Research Center for Environment and Economy of the State Environmental \nProtection Administration. ", "2 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  The GDP of Liaoning grew 10.2% annually in real terms between 1990 and 1995, and \n8.5% between 1996 and 2003. One main development objective of the government of Liaoning \nprovince (GLP) is to contain the worsening trend of environmental pollution and ecosystem \ndegradation, and to improve the environment in cities to demonstrate that rapid economic \ngrowth and a cleaner environment are compatible. GLP will strengthen its control of pollutant \ndischarge by issuing regulations on total pollutant emission control and improving monitoring \nand enforcement. Air quality in cities will be improved through the substitution of coal by gas \nwhere feasible, closing of polluting small boilers for heating, and increased use of efficient \ntechnologies and management that minimize urban pollution. The operational strategy of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in the PRC is aimed at helping the country achieve economic \ngrowth in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner. ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy includes \n(i) developing  cleaner  energy  sources,  (ii) renovating  and  retrofitting  existing  facilities  to \nimprove  efficiency  and  reduce  emissions,  (iii) promoting  the  corporatization  and \ncommercialization of energy utilities, and (iv) pricing and tariff reforms. This is complemented \nby ADB's strategy for the environment sector that supports the use of economic, supply-side, \nand other measures to (i) ensure sustainable utilization of natural resources and promotion of \nmarket-based pricing and  (ii) encourage cost recovery and better environmental information \ndisclosure. GLP will improve  air quality in   all major cities (including  all six project cities of \nAnshan,  Benxi,  Fushun,  Fuxin,  Liaoyang,  and  Yingkou)  to  meet  the  national  air  quality \nstandards by 2010; the Project is a major part of the effort. By working toward  reducing \nemissions,  the  Project  is  consistent  with  and  provides  support  for  addressing  GLP\u2019s \ndevelopment objectives. It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s energy and environmental strategy \n(Appendix 3). \n \n6.  The PRC coal mines have high CBM/CMM content.2 Underground methane is a threat to \nthe safety of coal miners because it is highly explosive. Methane must be removed during and \nsometimes prior to actual coal mining operations to ensure worker safety. Most of the methane \nremoved in mining operations is not used as an energy source but emitted as a greenhouse gas \ninto the environment. Coal mines in the PRC released approximately 6 billion m3 of methane \ninto the atmosphere in 2003 and are expected to release approximately 10 billion m3 by 2010. \nAs a  greenhouse gas, methane is approximately 21 times more potent  than carbon dioxide. \nLiaoning produces only 5.5% of the PRC\u2019s coal, but accounts for approximately 20% of national \nmethane emissions due to its geological conditions. Drainage of methane in underground coal \nmines has been undertaken in the PRC in an attempt to ensure safe production for decades. \nThe removal of methane from underground coal mines does not always meet the required \nnational standards, and has caused numerous fatal explosions. Under the Project, methane will \nbe  commercially  extracted  as  an  economic  source  of  energy  that  will  be  distributed  to \nhouseholds and industries as a fuel. Efficient extraction and utilization of methane will  help \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the safety of coal mines, and reduce domestic use \nof coal. \n \n7.  Liaoning has a population of about 41 million, with 55% living in urban areas. As an old \nindustrial base of the PRC, its economic structure is dominated by heavy industry with relatively \nold technology and large state-owned enterprises (SOEs).3 Because of its industrial structure \n                                                 \n2  Methane gas is part of the coal composition and adsorbed within the coal seam. The gas is released as a result of \ntemperature and pressure changes when underground coal is mined or exposed to surface conditions. Methane, \nwhen released through wells drilled from the surface into underground coal seams is referred to as CBM. CMM \nrefers to the methane released through mine shafts during underground coal mine operations. \n3  SOEs in Liaoning account for about one tenth of the total number of SOEs in the PRC. ", "3 \nand large urban population, Liaoning is the highest energy-consuming province in the PRC. \nContinued strong economic growth, combined with  a significant increase in urban housing \nconstruction,  has  resulted  in  heating  demand  outpacing  supply.  Cities  in  Liaoning  are \nexperiencing heating supply shortages that adversely affect the quality of life and health of \nurban residents, particularly the poor. Liaoning has about 3% of the country\u2019s total population \nbut accounts for about 10% of the total unemployed nationwide, leading to a growing concern \nabout the urban poor in Liaoning. This reflects growing urban unemployment brought about \nmainly by SOE reforms and technology changes, and in particular, retrenchment of excess \nemployees by large SOEs. The adverse effects of urban poverty are often compounded by \nenvironmental pollution from energy and heating sources at the household level. The poor do \nnot have the information, access, or  funds for  more efficient (less-polluting) equipment and \nfuels. The gas and heating distribution systems are usually badly functioning or absent in the \npoorer sections of the city. Poorly maintained gas and heating distribution systems increase the \nexposure of the poor to daily doses of pollutants as well as to the risk of accidents. Indoor air \npollution particularly puts women and children at risk. By improving the efficiency and capacity \nof city gas and heating distribution, closing  the existing  412 small heating boilers in Benxi, \nLiaoyang  and  Yingkou  cities,  and  implementing  tariff  reforms  and  special  tariff  reduction \nprograms, the Project will help reduce environmental pollution and ensure that the poor have an \naffordable and sufficient heating supply. \n \n8.  The affordability of the poor for heating services is a major concern in Liaoning. The \naverage heating bill for a poor household living in a 40 m2 apartment unit is about CNY167 per \nmonth during the 5-month long heating season. In a typical poor household of four people, the \nincome at the poverty line is CNY780 per household per month in Anshan, CNY624 in Benxi \nand Yingkou, and CNY728 in Liaoyang.4 Thus, the heating bill represents a large portion of a \npoor household\u2019s monthly income (21% in Anshan, 23% in Liaoyang, and 27% in Yingkou and \nBenxi). There is a serious affordability problem for poor households with income at or below the \ncity poverty lines. In the project areas where the temperature in  the winter can go as low as \nminus 35o Celsius, insufficient heating supply will severely affect the quality of life and health of \nthe poor. GLP is making efforts to provide urban minimum living standard and social assistance \nprograms to address the growing concern of urban poverty. Cost savings resulting from the \nefficiency improvement of the Project will be passed on to the poor in the form of lower gas and \nheating  bill,  and  connection  fee  discounts.  These  programs  will  be designed to alleviate \naffordability problems and ensure sufficient heating for the poor in the project cities. \n \n9.  The resources of local governments and those provided by the central Government are \ninadequate to finance the large-scale investments required by rising gas and heating demand.5 \nHowever, so far, the private sector has not been involved in gas distribution systems in the PRC \nand only a few joint ventures have been involved in combined heat and power generation plants \nand small CBM/CMM development operations. The present conditions in these subsectors do \nnot provide enough incentives to make them attractive to private investors because (i) coal mine \ncompanies had poor financial performance before 2003 due to low coal prices; (ii) CBM/CMM \ndevelopment  is  still  in  its  infant  stage  with  perceived  commercial  risks;  (iii) there  are \ntechnical/institutional uncertainties involving city governments\u2019 control over gas and heating \ndistribution; (iv) heating has been considered as part of the welfare system, leading to poor fee \ncollection; and (v) for gas and heating supply, clear and transparent tariff setting and approval \n                                                 \n4  The poverty level defined by the project cities under Part C of the Project is CNY195 per capita per month in \nAnshan, CNY156 in Benxi and in Yingkou, and CNY182 in Liaoyang. \n5  For instance, in Aletai city of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, heating expenditure was 10.9% of the city's \nbudget in 1999. \n   ", "4 \ncriteria and procedures are lacking. To encourage private sector participation in areas where \nonly the public sector had previously been involved, an enabling environment needs to be \ncreated. ADB policy dialogue in tariff reforms and institutional changes will promote private \nsector participation by helping create the enabling environment. \n \n10.  The PRC has increased its coal production in the last 2 years to meet the fast-growing \npower generation requirements. Increasing coal production runs the risk of increasing the \nalready high rate of coal mine accidents. The PRC has one of the worst records on mine \nfatalities. According to official figures, in 2002 about 6,900 miners died because of accidents, \nincluding  266 in  Liaoning.  However,  other  estimates  place  the  figure  above  10,000.6  The \nenforcement of mine safety and health laws at the local level is weak and ineffective. Small \nmine  operators  and  miners  do  not  follow  safety  and  health  best  practices.  The  Labor \nDepartment of the United States has provided two grants totaling $6.4 million to help worker \nprotection and mine safety in the PRC (Appendix 3). Coal mine safety improvement is a priority \nfor GLP. The Project provides a good opportunity to address the issue of coal mine safety and \nsome safety programs will be incorporated into the project design to improve mine safety. \n \n11.  During  the  2002  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  requested  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) from ADB to review and upgrade its feasibility study for \nthe Project.7 However, GLP subsequently informed ADB about its concern over the local funding \nfor some subcomponents. The PPTA consultants were not fielded until May 2003. A fact-finding \nmission visited the PRC from 3 to 20 November 2003, and an appraisal mission from 12 to \n27 April 2004. GLP approved the feasibility study reports in September 2004. The project design \ntakes into consideration problem and constraints analysis, lessons learned, and assessment of \nalternative approaches. Policy dialogue focus was formulated based on the findings of  ADB \nmissions, information provided by the Government, beneficiary consultations, discussions with \nother funding agencies, and recommendations of the feasibility reports and PPTA consultants. \nThe Project\u2019s  poverty classification is \u201cother,\u201d and the thematic objective is environmental \nimprovement. \n \n12.  Lessons  Learned.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  PRC\u2019s  energy  sector  has  shown  that \nprojects are generally well planned and implemented smoothly. The overall implementation \nperformance of ADB\u2019s energy portfolio in the PRC is satisfactory. Compliance with covenants is \ngenerally  acceptable,  although  greater  efforts  are  required  to  implement  policy-related \ncovenants. Rigorous government screening of projects has had a positive impact. The project \ncompletion and project performance audit reports for the energy projects indicate that overall \nthey were implemented smoothly, and assess them all as generally successful. Recently, some \nongoing energy projects in the PRC have experienced implementation delays relating to long \ninternal approval processes, procurement issues, and large cost savings. \n \n13.  However, the project completion reports prepared for three ADB environmental projects \nand the project performance audit reports for one of the environmental projects revealed that \nthe actual achievements of some heating supply components were lower than estimated at \nappraisal. There were several factors, such as lower demand for heating, insufficient heat \nsource, unsuitable design  for switching  from coal to natural gas, and lower heat and power \ntariffs than anticipated at the project appraisal. Some projected industrial establishments either \ndid not materialize or lacked the financial capacity to pay for heating services. Some heating \n                                                 \n6  Small-scale coal mines with a production of not more than 300,000 t a year, which account for about 50% of total \nannual coal production, are responsible for about 70% of the accidents. \n7  The PPTA was approved in September 2002 and the TA letter was signed in January 2003. ", "5 \ncomponents were canceled when no noticeable progress was made and after  the  project \nimplementation agencies realized that the projected market for steam and heat usage was \noverly optimistic. In addition, the design to switch  these heating companies\u2019 fuel source from \ncoal to natural gas would have seriously affected their financial viability and would have required \nlarge  government  subsidies.  The  lower  heat  and  power  tariffs  coupled  with  the  lower \nachievements have prevented the project entities from achieving good financial performance. \nThe Project will aim to ensure the viability and sustainability of heating supply by incorporating \nthese lessons in project design, preparation, risk assessment, and implementation. The Project \nhas also been discussed with other development partners involved or interested in CMM and \nCBM mitigation, and  in efficiency and safety improvement activities in the coal sector. The \nProject has been presented at various conferences and workshops where it was also discussed \nwith private sector parties involved in CBM exploration.8 Appendix 3 presents a summary of the \nexternal  assistance  and  lessons  learned.  Supplementary  Appendix B  provides  additional \ninformation. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n14.  The long-term goal of the Project is to support environmental improvement in Liaoning. \nThe main objectives of the Project are: (i) improvement in efficiency and reliability of gas and \ncentral heating supply and closure of small coal-fired boilers, and (ii) production and commercial \nutilization of CMM and CBM. Policy dialogue with the Government during project processing has \nfocused on: (i) maximizing  benefits  to  the  poor  and  ensuring  that  the  poor  have  sufficient \nheating by establishing specific gas and heating assistance programs, (ii) implementing market-\nbased heating tariff reforms and improving billing collection in project cities, and (iii) promoting \nprivate sector participation. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n15.  The  proposed  Project  comprises  the  following  components:  Part  A:  CBM/CMM \ndevelopment; Part B: gas distribution improvement; Part C: city central heating supply; and Part \nD: institutional reforms and corporate governance improvement. The feasibility studies and \nengineering  design  for  the  project  subcomponents  were  prepared  by  several  design  and \nengineering institutes in the PRC with experience and qualifications acceptable to ADB. The \nPPTA consultants reviewed the feasibility study reports and other supplementary documents \nand noted that their previous comments were reflected in the project design and were satisfied \nwith the quality of the feasibility studies and engineering design. \n \n16.  Part A: Coal Bed Methane and Coal Mine Methane Development. Part A will install in \nFuxin coalmine areas (i) 22 vertical wells, (ii) one 54,000 m3, one 10,000 m3 and one 5,000 m3 \nabove-ground  methane  gas  storage  tanks,  and  (iii)  three  CBM  extraction  stations.  This \ncomponent  will  produce  46 million m3  of  CBM/CMM  annually  and  increase  residential  and \nindustrial use of CBM/CMM. \n \n17.  Part  B:  Gas  Distribution  Improvement.  Part  B  consists  of  two  subcomponents: \n(i) Fushun  gas  distribution  improvement,  and  (ii) Benxi  gas  distribution  improvement.  The \n                                                 \n8  Including the Department for International Development, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Japan Coal \nEnergy Center, United Nations Development Programme, United States Environmental Protection Agency, United \nStates Labor Department, and World Bank. \n   ", "6 \nsubcomponent in Fushun city will (i) replace 15.5 kilometers (km) of aging CMM gas pipelines, \nand (ii) improve 45 pressure regulation stations to reduce excessive pipeline CMM gas losses \nand  accidents  and  to  increase  capacity  to  serve  5,000  new  households  annually.  The \nsubcomponent in Benxi city will (i) replace  43  km  of  aging  coke oven  gas pipelines, and \n(ii) install 5 km of new coke oven gas pipeline to cut down pipeline losses and accidents and \nserve 60,000 new households. \n \n18.  Part C: City Central Heating Supply. Part C has four subcomponents, consisting of \ncentral  heating  supply  for  each  of Anshan,  Benxi,  Liaoyang,  and  Yingkou.  The  Anshan \nsubcomponent in Anshan city includes (i) recovery of the waste heat from Anshan Steel No. 1 \nnew  blast  furnace,  (ii) recovery  of  the  heat  from  the  No.  2  thermal  power  plant,  and \n(iii) construction of a household heat supply control system. The Benxi subcomponent in Benxi \ncity will: (i) construct two 209-gigajoule (GJ)/hour circulating fluidized-bed hot water boilers and \nauxiliaries; (ii) construct 7 km of heat supply pipeline; (iii) construct 18 heat exchange stations; \nand (iv) close 63 existing small, inefficient, and polluting boilers. The Liaoyang subcomponent in \nLiaoyang  city  will:  (i) construct  eight  208 GJ/hour  hot  water  boilers  and  auxiliary  facilities; \n(ii) construct 4.2 km of heat distribution network and 55 heat exchange stations; and (iii) close \n174 existing small, inefficient, and polluting boilers. The Yingkou subcomponent in Yingkou city \nwill: (i) construct  one (2 x 12 MW) combined heat and power generation plant and auxiliaries; \n(ii) construct three 104 GJ/hour  hot  water  boilers; (iii) construct 40 km of heat supply and \ndistribution network and 12 heat exchange stations; and (iv) close 175 existing small, inefficient, \nand polluting boilers. \n \n19.  Part D: Institutional Reforms and Corporate Governance Improvement. In 2003, an \ninstitutional reform and corporate governance improvement study was carried out by the PPTA \nconsultants to assess the institutional  capacity  and  corporate  governance  of  each  project \nimplementation agency (PIA) and develop an institutional reform action plan for each PIA \n(Supplementary  Appendixes  C  and  D).  In  April  2004,  a  financial  reform  action  plan \n(Supplementary  Appendix  L)  was  prepared  by  the  PPTA  consultants  for  addressing  cost \nreduction, bill collection, and financial capacity of the  PIAs. The reform action plans were \ndiscussed and supported by the PIAs. To help the PIAs strengthen commercial and financial \nmanagement  capacity,  Part  D  comprises:  (i) institutional  strengthening  and  training  for \nimplementing the institutional reform action plans and the financial action plans prepared by the \nPPTA consultants,  (ii) assistance to the PIAs to implement the heating tariff reforms, and \n(iii) development of options for private sector participation. The institutional reform will require \nseparation  of  government  functions  from  commercial  management  of  the  PIAs,  and \ntransforming the noncorporate PIAs into new corporate structures according to the PRC\u2019s \nCompany Law. The financial reforms will assist all the PIAs to build capacity in cost reduction, \nbill collection, efficient accounting, and commercial management. The consultants  will help the \nPIAs prepare tariff reform action plans in accordance with the recommendations made by ADB \nTA 3673-PRC: Pro-poor Urban Heating Tariff Reforms.9 The TA formulated national pro-poor \nnational heating tariff guidelines and  established the principles of  an effective heating tariff \ncollection mechanism. The consultants under Part D will study the  options for private sector \nparticipation for the PIAs selected by GLP. The options developed and implemented will provide \na demonstration on how public utilities can be privatized without lowering the quality of utility \n                                                 \n9   The Executing Agency for the TA is the Ministry of Construction. The objective of the TA is to help the Government \nreform the urban heating sector and promote sustainable urban heating supply in the PRC by (i) formulating pro-\npoor national heating tariff guidelines, and (ii) establishing an effective heating tariff collection mechanism. The TA \nhas been nearly completed with the tripartite meeting held in August 2004. ", "7 \nsupply. The Project will provide a further opportunity for ADB to address policy concerns and \nhelp create a conducive environment for private sector participation. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n20.  Urban Heating Tariff Reforms. Heating tariff reforms are required to improve and to \nsustain urban heating supply. The current average heating tariff of about CNY20/m2 for the \nheating season in Liaoning is not low.10 Therefore, tariff reforms need to focus on the tariff \nstructure and collection. At present, all of the urban heating tariffs are based on a simple fixed \nrate per square meter (e.g., CNY/m2) of the living area or construction area of buildings. The \ncurrent heating tariff structure, payment, and collection systems have many problems including \nthe following: (i) tariffs do not reflect the cost of providing heating services, (ii) the tariff structure \ndoes not encourage efficient use of heat, (iii) the enterprise-based tariff payment system is not \nmarket-oriented and causes difficulty in tariff collection, and (iv) a lack of transparent criteria and \nmethodologies for tariff setting and adjustment. In addition, the layout of the piping system in \nexisting buildings makes it difficult for the heating company to disconnect supply to delinquent \ncustomers. In Liaoning, heating bills are generally paid by employers for their employees. In the \nmid-1990s, many SOEs became financially unviable and could not pay the heating bills for their \nemployees. This caused tariff collection to drop to 60%, creating severe financial difficulties for \nthe heating companies. Tariff collection improved to 80\u201385% in 2003 and a further improvement \nto 95% is expected with the Project. \n \n21.  To address these issues, GLP will implement the agreed heating tariff reforms in the \nproject cities (Supplementary Appendix E). The consultants under Part D will help remove the \nbarriers  and develop specific reform action plans for: (i) installing lock valves in apartment units \nin buildings to help improve tariff collection efficiency, (ii) installing radiator control valves in \napartment units to encourage heat conservation, (iii) implementing a two-part heating tariff so \nthat the variable charge will be based on actual heat consumption, (iv) installing heat-measuring \ndevices in apartment units to support consumption-based billing systems, and (v) training of \nheating company staff on implementation of reform measures. After the reforms, consumers will \nhave the ability to regulate the amount of heat that they consume. This is essential for tariff-\nbased incentives for heat conservation, installing insulation, and taking measures to reduce heat \nloss to work. All new buildings in Liaoning are now required to follow new building codes and \nuse energy-efficient building materials. \n \n22.  Maximizing the Project\u2019s Impact on the Poor. In the project cities, heating bills \ncurrently account for 21% to 27% of the average monthly incomes of poor households. Though \nimproving facilities and supply efficiency will  likely obviate  further tariff increases, measures \nneed to be taken to make gas and heating more affordable to the poor. GLP agreed to include \ntwo specific programs. The first program will require the PIAs to provide gas and heating \nconnection and tariff discounts to the poor, based on the benefits of the cost savings arising \nfrom  the  20%  efficiency  improvement  and  increase  to  95%  bill  collection. Each PIA has \ncommitted to share the benefits and extend the discount to the poor after satisfying the loan \nconditions. They estimate that 90,870 poor households will benefit from the discount on gas and \nheating supply connection fee (38,900 poor households) and gas and heating bills (51,970 poor \nhouseholds),  resulting  in  an  annual  benefit  of  CNY20 million  in  connection  fees,  and \nCNY12 million in discounts on gas and heating bills. This will be about 4% of the total revenue \nof the gas and heating companies after the Project is complete. The second program requires \n                                                 \n10  The heating tariff of CNY20/m2 in Liaoning is comparable with about  CNY24/m2 in  Beijing, CNY20/m2 in \nHeilongjiang, and CNY19.5/m2 in Xinjiang. \n   ", "8 \nthe city governments to establish a \u201cheating assistance fund\u201d for the poor. It will be included in \nthe city\u2019s annual budget and the funding level will not  depend on budget availability. The city \ngovernment\u2019s subsidies through the heating assistance fund will be designed so that a poor \nhousehold\u2019s heating  expenses do not exceed 5% of  its monthly expenditure (compared with \nheating expenditure of 3.8% for low-income households in the United States). Further, the \nrecently approved TA (TA 4402-PRC: Heating Supply for Urban Poor in Liaoning Province) will \nhelp GLP implement   pro-poor national heating tariff guidelines and improve tariff collection; \ndesign  heating  assistance  programs  for  the  poor;  and  develop  an  effective  monitoring, \nsupervision, and evaluation system at the provincial and local levels. It will also examine the \npossibility of a lifeline tariff. To make heating affordable, about CNY48 million will be provided \nthrough the heating assistance fund. In case there is a shortfall under the first program from the \nPIAs  due  to  a  delay  in  realizing  project  benefits,  the  city  governments  will  increase  the \ncontribution to cover the gap. These assistance programs are consistent with ADB\u2019s policy that \ntariff subsidies to the poor be transparent and explicit, and funded by the government budget, \nwhich will separate the welfare objective from the commercial management of the public utilities. \n \n23.  Closure of Small Coal-Fired Heat Boilers. The Project will build large and efficient \n(above 80% combustion efficiency) heating boilers equipped with modern pollution control \ndevices to facilitate the closure of 412 small coal-fired heating boilers. These small boilers have \nlow thermal efficiency in the range of 55% to 65% and do not have adequate pollution-control \ndevices.  Furthermore,  the  chimneys  of  small  boilers  are  not  tall  enough  to  disperse  the \nemissions  from  coal  burning  away  from  residential  areas,  creating  severe  urban  pollution \nproblems. The environmental benefits from the closure include the emission reduction of TSP \nby 18,200 tons per year (t/y); SO  by 2,500 t/y; NO  by 1,700 t/y; and CO  by 437,400 t/y. The \n2 x 2\nquantifiable  local  environmental  benefits  over  the  project  life  are  expected  to  be  about \nCNY823.8 million in net present value at 2003 prices. In addition, the global environmental \nbenefits from CO reduction are expected to be about CNY90.3 million in net present value at \n2 \n2003 prices.11 In accordance with ADB\u2019s  social protection strategy, GLP and the PIAs will \nensure that all 1,874 workers affected by the closure are reemployed in a timely manner and in \naccordance  with  the  reemployment  action  plan  prepared  by  the  PIAs  (Supplementary \nAppendix F), so that they will be at least as well off as they would have been in the absence of \nthe Project. \n \n24.  Potential Clean Development Mechanism Benefits. The Project has the potential to \nprovide certified emission reductions  under the clean development mechanism (CDM). The \nProject  will  help  (i) remove  policy  barriers  to  CMM/CBM  development,  (ii) overcome \ntechnological barriers to efficient extraction and production of CMM/CBM, and (iii) remove \nfinancial barriers for the use of CMM/CBM as fuel. Emission reductions will be achieved by \nreducing methane venting to the atmosphere. At the request of the Executing Agency (EA)\u2014\nnamely, GLP\u2014ADB will provide further assistance with the development of a project concept \nnote  and  a  project  design  document.  ADB (through  its  CDM  Facility),  the  EA, and the \nGovernment  will  cooperate  in  development,  validation,  and  registration  of  the  emission \nreductions that will result from the Project, and ADB's CDM Facility will also assist in marketing \nthe certified emission reductions. A complete outline of the services to be extended by the CDM \nFacility is provided in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n25.  Improvement  of  Coal  Mine  Safety.  By  extracting  methane  from  coal  mines,  the \nCBM/CMM development component under the Project  is expected to  reduce the  number of  \n                                                 \n11  The calculation is based on the environmental externality cost as defined in ADB. 1996. Workbook on Economic \nEvaluation of Environmental Impacts. Manila. It is estimated at CNY33.9 per ton of CO. \n2", "9 \ncoal mine accidents in Liaoning.12 The PIA agreed to strengthen its coal mine safety programs \nidentified  by  the  PPTA  consultants.  These  programs,  which  will  be  implemented  at  the \nCBM/CMM extraction and utilization facilities, include: (i) improving safety training of miners and \ninspectors,  (ii) upgrading  automatic  methane  detection  systems,  (iii) making  more  frequent \nsafety  inspections  and  drills,  and  (iv) providing more frequent updates of the mine safety \nprograms. The specific safety programs, with a goal of improving the overall coal mine safety \nindex by at least 20%. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n26.  Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and are detailed in Appendix 4. The \ntotal project cost is $161.0 million equivalent, including physical and price contingencies, and \nfinancial charges during development.

Financing Plan \n \n27.  A loan  of $70.0 million (44% of the total project cost) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources will finance bulk of the foreign cost component of the Project. The loan will have a  \n25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and \n                                                 \n12  About 80% of coal mine accidents in the PRC are attributable to methane explosions. \n   ", "10 \nProject Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The remaining foreign exchange cost of \n$6 million will be financed with equity form the PIAs. The local costs amounting to $85.0 million \nequivalent will be financed with equity from the respective PIAs and with loans from local banks. \nThe loans from local banks will have a repayment period of 14 to 15 years, including a grace \nperiod of 4 to 5 years, and carry an interest rate of about 5.8% per year. The Borrower will be \nthe PRC, which will make the proceeds of the loan available to GLP on the same terms and \nconditions as those of the loan. GLP will onlend the proceeds of the loan in amounts relating to \nthe subcomponents to the respective PIAs which will carry out these subcomponents on the \nsame terms and conditions as the loan. The PIAs will assume the foreign exchange and interest \nvariation risks of the loan. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign  Local     Total \nSource  % \nExchange  Currency      Cost \nEquity  6.00  54.26  60.26  37.4 \nFuxin CBM/CMM Development and Utilization Company  1.53  7.79  9.32  5.8 \nFushun Gas General Company  0.16  0.72  0.89  0.6 \nBenxi Gas General Company  0.27  1.54  1.81  1.1 \nAnshan General Heating Company  0.92  5.33  6.25  3.9 \nBenxi General Heating Company  0.53  2.16  2.69  1.7 \nLiaoyang Real Estate Heating Company  1.36  11.23  12.59  7.8 \nYingkou Heating Company  1.23  25.49  26.72  16.6 \nLoans  70.00  30.74  100.74  62.6 \nAsian Development Bank  70.00  0.00  70.00  43.5  \nLocal Banks  0.00  30.74  30.74  19.1 \nTotal  76.00  85.00  161.00  100.0  \nCBM = coal bed methane, CMM = coal mine methane. \nSource: Financing plan of the executing agency. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  Project Management. GLP will be the EA for the Project. The subcomponents will be \nimplemented by various PIAs. A project management office (PMO) will be responsible for \nmanaging, coordinating, and supervising implementation of all project subcomponents. Each \nPIA will establish a project implementation office (PIO) to  be directly responsible for design, \nconstruction, and operation of subprojects. \n \n29.  Implementation Period. It is envisaged that the construction of the project facilities will \ntake place over a period of more than 4 years beginning in early  2005, and  that  project \ncomponents will be completed by March 2009. Site preparation for some heating facilities has \nbeen completed while the routing of the transmission and distribution pipelines and the location \nof  the  related  facilities  have  been  finalized.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 5. \n \n30.  Procurement. All goods under the Project to be wholly or partly financed by ADB will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts costing \nmore than $5 million and each supply contract costing more than $500,000 financed by ADB will \nbe procured through international competitive bidding procedures using ADB\u2019s standard bidding \ndocuments. Other supply contract packages costing less than $500,000 will be procured using ", "11 \ninternational  shopping  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts  costing  $5 million  or  less  will  be \nprocured through local competitive bidding. All locally financed items will be procured using \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. A list of procurement packages and their modes of procurement \nare  in  Appendix  6.  The  GLP  will  set  up  an  imprest  account  after  loan  effectiveness  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). Disbursements from the \nimprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related \ndocumentation. Such documentation will demonstrate, among other things, that the goods \nand/or services are (i) produced in and procured from ADB's members, and (ii) eligible for ADB \nfinancing. The initial amount to be deposited into the imprest accounts will be $5.0 millions. The \nstatement of expenditures procedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures \nand individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the procedure will not exceed \n$100,000. \n \n31.  Consulting Services. International and domestic consultants financed under the loan \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. For project \nimplementation supervision, international and domestic consultants will be engaged to assist \nGLP and the PIAs with (i) project design and engineering, (ii) procurement, (ii) construction \nsupervision related to equipment and materials procured under ADB financing, (iii) project \nmanagement, and (iv) monitoring the Project\u2019s impact and reporting to ADB and GLP. The terms \nof  reference  for  the  implementation  supervision  consulting  services  have  been  prepared \n(Supplementary Appendix H). About 12 person-months of international and 70 person-months \nof domestic consulting services will be required.13 International and domestic consultants will be \nrecruited for institutional reforms and the corporate governance improvement subcomponent of \nthe Project, which includes institutional training and a study to implement the restructuring of \nheating tariffs in project cities. The terms of reference for consulting services have been \nprepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  I).  It  is  envisaged  that  about  8  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services and about 30 person-months of domestic consulting services \nwill be required. Further, some domestic consultants will be engaged by the PMO and the PIOs \nfor site supervision and various  tasks relating to  project implementation. They will have  the \nqualifications and experience acceptable to ADB. GLP was informed of the selection procedures \nof the quality and cost-based selection method. \n \n32.  Disbursement  Arrangements.  The  Government  and  GLP  will  adopt either of the \nfollowing disbursement procedures for withdrawal of proceeds of the loan in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook: (i) a direct payment procedure, wherein ADB, at the \nrequest  of  the  Government,  pays  a  designated  beneficiary  directly;  or  (ii) a  commitment \nprocedure,  wherein  ADB,  at  the  request  of  the  Government,  provides  an  undertaking  to \nreimburse a commercial bank for payments made or to be made to a supplier against a letter of \ncredit financed from the loan account. The disbursement of the amount of the loan proceeds \nrequired for a subproject will be subject to the condition that the onlending agreement for the \nconcerned subcomponent in form and substance acceptable to ADB has been duly executed \nand delivered, and is legally binding on the parties thereto. The reimbursement procedure will \nbe used for disbursements with regard to any eligible retroactive financing. The executing and \ndelivery of an onlending agreement is a condition to disbursement of loan proceeds to that \nsubcomponent. \n \n33.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing. In view of the advanced \nstage of project preparation, ADB has agreed to advance procurement action and has agreed in \n                                                 \n13  About 20 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided to develop benchmarks and indicators \nfor the economic, social, and environmental impact of the Project. \n   ", "12 \nprinciple to retroactive financing for up to $7.0 million (equivalent to 10% of the ADB loan) with \nregard to payment of consulting services and procurement contracts awarded from October \n2004 up to loan effectiveness of the Project.14 \n \n34.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting \nsystems and procedures for the Project  will be in accordance with the  Guidelines for the \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. Each PIA will \nmaintain separate accounts of their operations and of the Project  and submit through the PMO \nto ADB audited project accounts and agency financial statements  in English not later than \n6 months after the end of the financial year. The Government, GLP, and the PIAs have been \ninformed  about  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited  financial  statements  and  possible \npenalties for delays in submission. The submitted audited project accounts and agency financial \nstatements should  be  of  acceptable  quality  and  should  be  prepared  in  accordance  with \ninternationally accepted accounting standards. Financial statements with adverse opinions of \ndisclaimers  from  auditors  are  considered  unacceptable  and  cannot  be  submitted  for  this \npurpose. GLP and the PIAs through the PMO will also submit to ADB reports and information \nconcerning the use of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and the performance of each \nPIA. The reports will include (i) quarterly progress reports on project implementation, and (ii) a \nproject completion report not later than 3 months after completion of the project facilities. The \nPIAs will finance the annual audits to be carried out by auditing firms with experience and \nqualifications acceptable to ADB. \n \n35.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s rules and practices were explained to GLP, and ADB standard \nbidding documents and guidelines for tender evaluation were handed over to GLP. Attention \nwas drawn to the sections on fraud and corruption  that were added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders, \nsuppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  the \nprocurement and execution of contracts, and the sanctions to be applied if fraud and corruption \nare discovered. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all \ndocuments and contracts during bidding and implementation of the Project. Items financed by \nthe PIAs with local currency funds will be procured following bidding procedures acceptable to \nADB. For the Project, GLP will take the following anticorruption actions: (i) involving full-time \nofficials  from  the  Liaoning  Development  and  Reform  Commission\u2019s  supervision  division  in \nbidding,  construction,  and  operations;  and  (ii) carrying  out  periodic  inspections  of  the \ncontractors\u2019 activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n36.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. A project performance management \nsystem  (PPMS)  was  developed  by  GLP  with  the  assistance  of  the  PPTA  consultants \n(Supplementary Appendix J). The PPMS includes a set of measurable indicators that were \ndeveloped based on the project design, impacts, and risks. The macroeconomic and sector \nperformance,  institutional  capacity,  and  reforms  were  taken  into  account  in  designing  the \nmonitoring  indicators.  These  indicators  are  also  presented  in  the  project  framework.  The \nindicators cover environmental impacts, e.g., greenhouse gas (including CO  and methane gas), \n2\nTSP, SO , and NO  emissions; social and poverty impacts focusing on new job creation; the \n2 x\nnumber of poor households to be provided with central heating and gas services; and heating \nbill  assistance  and  discounts.  A  feedback  and  reporting  mechanism  for  effective  project \nimplementation and initial startup activities, including a baseline survey based on a random \nhousehold sample to be monitored with the follow-up surveys, was included in the PPMS. The \n                                                 \n14  The advance action was published in the Internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities of October 2004 and in \nits printed version of November 2004.  ", "13 \nimplementation consultants will carry out the monitoring of the project impacts during the \nimplementation  period.  GLP  and  the  PIAs  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  progress  of \nimplementation of the environmental mitigation plan through  quarterly progress reports and \nreports on achievement of resettlement, environmental, and social objectives to be submitted on \ncompletion  and  1  year  thereafter.  A  longer-term  monitoring  plan  beyond  the  project \nimplementation period will be developed by the consultants and implemented by GLP. The \nconsultants will establish an effective monitoring and evaluation system to monitor the impact of \nthe Project, which will provide the basis for GLP\u2019s impact monitoring after project completion. \nThe monitoring and evaluation system will include specific and measurable targets, and identify \nkey risks and  institutional arrangements for effective monitoring. The consultants will also \nprovide the necessary training on monitoring. \n \n37.  Project Review\u2014Project Implementing Agencies and Financial Performance. All PIAs \nare SOEs established either under the PRC\u2019s Enterprise Law or the Company Law. The Fuxin \nCDM/CMM  Development  and  Utilization  Company  is  a  subsidiary  of  Fuxin  Mining  Group \nCompany  and  has  been  in  commercial  operation  for  3  years.  The  two  gas  distribution \ncompanies, Fushun Gas General Company and Benxi Gas General Company, have supplied \ngas to the respective cities for many years. Similarly, the four heating companies, Anshan \nGeneral Heating Company, Benxi General Heating Company, Liaoyang Real Estate Heating \nCompany, and Yingkou Heating Company, were established in 1981, 1999, 1984 and 1993, \nrespectively. The PIAs follow the accounting system prescribed by the PRC, which is oriented \ntoward internationally accepted accounting standards. An external auditor acceptable to ADB \nwill be selected to audit the project and company financial statements. \n \n38.  The financial statements (1999 to 2003) and projected financial performance (2004 to \n2009) of the individual PIAs are given in Supplementary Appendix K and a summary is in \nAppendix 7. The financial performance of the PIAs has resulted either in small losses or modest \nprofits. The initial operations (development stage) of the Fuxin CDM/CMM Development and \nUtilization Company broke even, which will improve with the Project because the methane gas \nhas a good market. The company has finalized, in principle, gas sale agreements with large \ncustomers. The two gas distribution companies cited inappropriate tariff structures and levels as \nthe  main  reason  for  the  marginal  performance.  With  active  policy  dialogue,  Fushun city \ngovernment approved the required tariff adjustment in September 2004, which will be effective \nfrom 1 November 2004. In Benxi, gas is supplied from a local steel mill and the city government \nhas agreed to pass through any future price increase. The main problems of the four heating \ncompanies are poor collection, operational inefficiency, and expenditure related to their social \nrole. Installation of lock valves and heat meters in apartment units has already improved \ncollection efficiency substantially, from a historical low of 60%, to 70% in 2001 and to 80\u201385% in \n2003.  The  PPTA  consultants  reviewed  the  PIAs\u2019  financial  performance  and  cited  certain \noperational inefficiencies common to SOEs (Supplementary Appendix L). The PIAs have started \nimplementing the recommended measures to improve the financial performance. The Project \nwill address concerns regarding high distribution losses and inefficient small boilers. Other \nareas that need cost reduction are personnel productivity; coal, electricity and utility costs; and \nthe social costs borne by the enterprises. GLP is very supportive of gas and heating tariff \nadjustments and institutional reforms because of its thrust on cleaning up  air pollution. It is \nfocusing  on  separating  the  utilities  from  the  government\u2019s  function  (including  transparent \nsubsidies  for  their  social  role),  which  will  make  them  financially  viable  and  independent \ncorporations. Further, the heating companies will substantially increase the consumer base \nwhen independent small boilers are shut down, as agreed under the Project. The gas and \nheating companies have little long-term debt since most of the assets were transferred to them \nas government equity. Hence, debt-equity ratios are favorable and debt servicing is not a \n   ", "14 \nconcern at present. Overall, increases in heating sales, implementation of heating tariff reforms \n(paras. 20 and 21), and improvements in operational efficiency will improve the profitability of \nthe heating companies and allow them to meet the financial targets. \n \n39.  Implementation of the Project will make the gas and heating companies more  attractive. \nTheir profitability and financial sustainability will also improve because of ADB\u2019s assistance in \nheating-tariff, financial, and institutional reforms. This will help increase private sector interest. \nGLP has agreed to promote the privatization of PIAs, particularly through  a stock exchange \nlisting. It will prepare a privatization plan for the PIAs by 2006, which will be developed in \nconsultation with the city governments and with inputs from the consultants for Part D. \n \n40.  Project Review\u2014Environmental Measures. The Project is classified as environment \ncategory  B.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (summary  IEE)  is  included  in \nAppendix 8. The Project has substantial environmental benefits resulting from energy efficiency \nimprovements, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and reduction in emissions from coal \nburning. Potential adverse impacts were assessed during project preparation and are temporary \nand localized during construction. The PIAs will implement prudent construction management \npractices  to  minimize  any  construction  impacts.  These  include:  (i) limiting  the  clearing  of \nvegetation  and  other  construction  activities  to  avoid  any  unnecessary  disturbance  to  the \nsurrounding residents and vegetation; (ii) construction wastes and debris will be placed only in \ndesignated disposal areas; (iii) restoring and revegetating after construction  any disturbed or \nexcavated areas during construction; (iv) implementing strict erosion and dust control measures, \nincluding limiting the speed of construction trucks, frequent watering of the dirt access roads, \nand other measures; (v) restricting the hours and speeds of construction trucks and equipment \nto  minimize  impacts  on  nearby  residents;  (vi) demolishing  412  small  heating  boilers  and \ndisposing of wastes in compliance with environmental standards and guidelines of the PRC, \nLiaoning, and project cities; and (vii) requiring workers to follow strict sanitation, social, safety, \nand environmental management guidelines. The project implementation consultants will monitor \nand  ensure  implementation  of  these  mitigating  measures  to  minimize  impacts  during \nconstruction. \n \n41.  Provincial and local environmental protection bureaus are expanding public information \nprograms, mainly via web sites, newspapers, television, and radio.15 Improved environmental \ndisclosure  is  expected  to  facilitate  environmental  management  measures  included  in  the \nProject. In principle, ADB supports the expanded public information programs, including the \nenvironmental performance rating pilot project tested in Nanjing and other PRC cities during the \npast 2 years. Local environmental protection bureaus in Liaoning will expand their public \ndisclosure activities. GLP will ensure that any adverse environmental impacts arising from the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  project  facilities  will  be  minimized  by  implementing  the \nmitigation measures as identified in the IEE and summary IEE. \n \n42.  Project  Review\u2014Social  Issues  and  Poverty  Reduction.  Only  one  project \nsubcomponent involves permanent land acquisition. The other subcomponents will result in a \ntemporary  disturbance  to  roads  and  thus  require  compensation  payments  to  government \nagencies for necessary arrangement and support during  project implementation.  The Fuxin \nCBM/CMM development requires land acquisition and compensation for three households that \nlose part of their farmland, and 46 households will receive compensation for temporary land \n                                                 \n15  The State Environmental Protection Agency has directed all cities to begin public awareness  and disclosure \nprograms by the end of 2004. Most cities in the PRC have mature public awareness programs  and many have \nalready initiated some type of expanded environmental information disclosure program. ", "15 \noccupation. Participatory project appraisal was carried out in 2003 to consult the affected \npersons on their needs and preferences. A socioeconomic survey of all 49 affected households \nwas conducted in October 2003. The impacts are minor and most of the affected people will \nreceive cash compensation; a few will receive replacement land.  To mitigate the impacts, \ncompensation standards and a rehabilitation plan have been proposed in the resettlement plan. \nResettlement information booklet was distributed to all affected households. The resettlement \nplan was  published on ADB's resettlement web site  in October 2004. A summary  of the \nresettlement plan is provided in Appendix 9 and the plan itself is provided in Supplementary \nAppendix M. GLP, PMO, and the PIAs will ensure that all affected persons are compensated in \na timely manner and resettled in accordance with the  resettlement plan. The PIA will have \nfurther consultation with the affected persons during  project implementation. The  estimated \nbudget for resettlement compensation and rehabilitation is CNY36.5 million. \n \n43.  ADB  commissioned  a  social  and  poverty  impact  assessment  (SPIA)  in  2003  that \nincluded field interviews of the poor. Consultations were also held to gain an understanding of \ngender differences in  consumption patterns, needs, and priorities.  During SPIA preparation, \nvarious  participatory  techniques,  such  as  household  interviews,  focus  group  discussions, \nsocioeconomic survey of households, meetings with enterprises, and site reconnaissance, were \nused.16 Many government organizations, including the  provincial and municipal civil affairs \nbureau, poverty reduction office, labor and social security bureau, development and reform \ncommission, health bureau, statistics bureau, minority affairs committee, women\u2019s federation, \nenvironmental protection bureau, real estate development bureau, and tourism administration \nbureau,  were  consulted.  A  participation  and  awareness  program  will  be  established  to \nencourage the active involvement of local communities to maximize their participation in the \nProject. The program will take the form of annual survey questionnaires. A summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 10, summarizing the poverty reduction \nand social impacts. Twenty person-months of consulting services will be allocated for the design \nand implementation of the participation and awareness program. The social impact study will be \ncontracted out to a local consulting firm or research institute, to be carried out on the basis of \nprocedures and terms of reference acceptable to ADB. \n \n44.  An impact assessment on ethnic minorities in the project area was carried out by the \nPPTA consultants in accordance with ADB's policy on indigenous peoples. The results indicated \nthat  the  project  impact  on  ethnic  minorities  is  generally  positive  but  insignificant,  as  only \n10 Mongolian households and two Hui households will be affected by permanent or temporary \nland occupation resulting from the construction of Fuxin CBM/CMM Development. Mitigation \nmeasures will be implemented to alleviate the land occupation impact. In the resettlement plan, \nspecial provisions are provided to minority households, including a social  assistance fund of \nCNY5,000 per affected household. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n45.  The Project includes economic, financial, environmental, and social assessments. The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                 \n16  A stratified random sampling based on income for 1,000 beneficiary households, including 700 rural and \n300 urban households, was conducted. \n   ", "16 \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n1.  Least-Cost Assessment and Economic Viability \n \n46.  The PPTA consultants reviewed the demand forecast for the Project and concluded that \nthe risk associated with the demand forecast is minimal (Supplementary Appendix N). This is \nbecause the Project will provide supply to meet only a fraction of the total gas and heating \ndemand in the project cities. The gas distribution component will meet only a small share of the \ntotal incremental demand for gas in the project cities. The city central heating supply component \nwill replace the existing small boilers to meet  existing heating demand. There is little risk \nassociated with the demand forecast in the economic and financial viability analyses. A least-\ncost analysis was performed for the two categories of end use to be served by the Project, \nincluding:  (i) household  cooking  and  water  heating  and  (ii) household  space  heating.  For \nhousehold cooking and water heating, the analysis indicates that coal gas is the least-cost \noption. When CBM/CDM are available, they are the least-cost options. For household space \nheating, the least-cost analysis concludes that combined heat and power proposed for Yinkou \ncity heating supply and large boilers proposed for other cities for heating supplies are the least-\ncost options.  \n \n47.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  for  each  project \nsubcomponent and for the whole Project including all project components. As in the least-cost \nanalysis, the economic analysis applied the conversion factors to investment costs for land,17 \nequipment  cost,  fuel  costs,  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  where  applicable.  The \nbenefits of output were valued based on the cost saving of alternative fuels and efficiency \nimprovement. The cost-saving benefits were valued as the cost differences of the energy supply \noptions with and without the Project. A survey was carried out to determine the appropriate \nenergy supply options for each category of consumers. The local environmental benefits were \ntaken into account in the EIRR calculation. Line losses were based on the statistics of historical \nline-loss rates in each project city. \n \n48.  An economic evaluation of the environmental  impacts of the Project was carried out \nbased on the benefits transfer method. The evaluation used (i) the methodology adopted in \nADB\u2019s Economic Evaluation of Environmental Impacts: A Workbook (1996) to determine the \nadjusted estimate of the monetary damages caused by air pollution during the study period, \ntaking into account the location of the pollution sources, the emission level, and the population \naffected; and (ii) estimates of average annual climate change for carbon emissions to evaluate \nthe monetary damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions (Supplementary Appendix O). The \nEIRRs  presented  in  Table  3  include  only  the  local  environmental  benefits.  If  the  global \nenvironmental benefits were included, the EIRR for the whole Project would increase to 28.8%. \n \n49.  The  summary  results  of  the  EIRR  calculation  presented  in  Table  3  (details  in \nSupplementary Appendix P) reflect all project-related costs, the benefits from cost savings of \nalternative fuels and efficiency improvement, and local environmental benefits. This approach \nyields  EIRRs  from  10.0%  to  18.5%  without,  and  from  16.8%  to  43.8%  with,  the  local \nenvironmental benefits for the project subcomponents, and 13.6% without and 26.3% with the \nlocal environmental benefits for the whole Project. Sensitivity analyses were performed for each \nsubcomponent. For the EIRR of the whole Project, sensitivity analysis (Appendix 11) showed \nthe EIRR would decrease to (i) 20.7% if the Project was to experience a cost overrun of 20%; \n                                                 \n17  Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization). ", "17 \n(ii) 19.6% if the benefits were reduced by 20%; (iii) 22.7% if the Project was to experience a \ncommissioning delay of 1 year; and (iv) 12.3% if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happened. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Economic Internal Rates of Return \nSubcomponent  EIRR (%)    EIRR (%) \n  Without Environmental    With Local Environmental \nBenefits  Benefits \nFuxin CBM/CMM Development  18.5    18.5 \nFushun Gas Distribution Improvement  10.0    16.8 \nBenxi Gas Distribution Improvement  12.4    17.3 \nAnshan Central Heating Supply  13.6    28.9 \nBenxi Central Heating Supply  10.8    25.2 \nLiaoyang Central Heating Supply  13.9    43.8 \nYingkou Central Heating Supply  10.4    18.1 \nWhole Project  13.6    26.3 \nCBM = coal bed methane, CMM = coal mine methane, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  2.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n50.  The  financial  viability  of  the  subcomponents  will  be  ensured  by  the  revenue \nenhancement and cost reduction measures including the implementation of a two-part heating \ntariff. The  financial internal rates of return (FIRR) of the subcomponents are summarized in \nTable 4. The FIRR for all subcomponents compares favorably with the respective estimated \nweighted  average  costs  of  capital  (WACCs),  which  demonstrates  their  financial  viability \n(Appendix 12). Overall, the FIRR for the Project is estimated at 8.7%. Sensitivity analysis \nshowed the FIRR for the whole project would decrease to (i) 7.4% if the Project  was to \nexperience a cost overrun of 10%; (ii) 5.1% if the benefits were reduced by 10%; (iii) 7.5% if the \noperating  costs  were  increased  by  10%;  (iv) 7.2%  if  the  Project  were  to  experience  a \ncommissioning delay of 1 year; and (v) 4.0% if both (ii) and (iv) happened. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Financial Internal Rates of Return and \nWeighted Average Costs of Capital \nSubcomponent  FIRR (%)  WACC (%) \nFuxin CBM/CMM Development  8.6  4.2 \nFushun Gas Distribution Improvement  8.7  4.3 \nBenxi Gas Distribution Improvement  8.5  4.2 \nAnshan Central Heating Supply  8.3  4.3 \nBenxi Central Heating Supply  8.9  4.1 \nLiaoyang Central Heating Supply  8.6  4.2 \nYingkou Central Heating Supply  8.9  4.5 \nWhole Project  8.7  4.3 \nCBM = coal bed methane, CMM = coal mine methane, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, WACC = weighted \naverage cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  Environmental Benefits \n \n51.  The IEE concludes that the Project will provide an overall benefit to the environment in \nthe  project  area.  Regional  air  quality  will  improve  with closure of small  coal-fired boilers, \nextraction of CBM/CMM, more efficient gas distribution systems, and reduction  in coal use \nbecause of more efficient boilers. The environmental benefits from the Project include  coal \n   ", "18 \nsavings of 217,500 t/yr, and an emission reduction of TSP of 18,800 t/y, SO  of 2,600 t/y, NOx \n2\nof 1,700 t/y, and greenhouse gas of CO  equivalent of 840,900 t/y. Water and soil pollution will \n2\nbe indirectly reduced due to lower rates of pollutant transfer from air to water, with reduced \nstress on local ecosystems. The quantifiable local environmental benefits over the project life \nare expected to be about CNY846 million in net present value at 2003 prices. The global \nenvironmental benefits of greenhouse gas reduction (CO  and CBM/CMM) are expected to be \n2\nabout  CNY163  million  in  net  present  value  at  2003  prices.  Unquantifiable  environmental \nbenefits, such as damages from the wastewater of small boilers and gas leaking, are also \nsignificant. \n \nC.  Social Benefits  \n \n52.  The Project will directly benefit an urban population of about 2.7 million in the six project \nbeneficiary cities.18 Among these people, 1.9 million urban residents will benefit from gas supply \nand 0.8 million urban residents from central heating supply. Of the total beneficiary population, \nabout 199,800 people (7.4% of the beneficiaries) have incomes below the local urban poverty \nlines (ranging from CNY1,872 to CNY2,460 per year). The increased use of gas and better \ncentral heating supplies will reduce the use of conventional fuels such as raw coal, wood, and \ncoal briquettes to mitigate environmental and health impacts, particularly on the poor. \n \n53.  The Project will create about 7,280 person-years of employment opportunities during the \nproject construction phase and 1,940 full-time jobs during the operation of the Project. Of the \ntotal, 2,910 person-years of employment opportunities will be filled by the poor, women, and \nminorities  with  an  estimated  total  of  CNY28 million  in  wage  payments  during  the  project \nconstruction period. In addition, 780 employment opportunities with CNY8.4 million of annual \nwage payments are expected to go to the poor, women, and minorities during project operation. \nLocal procurement of the materials required for the Project is expected to create additional jobs. \nThe improved urban environment should enhance the local investment climate to attract more \ninvestment to the region and act as a catalyst for future development. \n \n54.  The improvement of  the air quality will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of air-\nrelated diseases and associated medical costs, loss of working days, as well as human suffering \nin the project beneficiary areas. The poor, elderly, children, and women, who have less coping \nresources and are more vulnerable, will benefit disproportionately from the replacement of coal \nand wood. In particular, women usually spend more time than men on cooking; the length of \ntheir exposure to smoke is considerable higher than men\u2019s. Moreover, survey results show that \nthe majority of  urban residents consider that  greater gas and central heating supplies will \nimprove the overall quality of life, reduce  housework for women, decrease health problems, \nincrease comfort and entertainment activities, and  encourage children to study longer in the \nwinter. A benefit distribution and poverty impact ratio analysis was carried out to compute the \npoverty impact ratio of the Project (Appendix 13). The share of net project economic benefits \ndirectly  accruing  to  the  poor  is estimated at 13.9%.    Since  the  poverty  impact  ratio is \nsubstantially higher than the ratio of poverty population to total population in the project areas \n(7.4%), the Project is considered to be pro-poor. \n \nD.  Assessment of Project Risks \n \n55.  A demand analysis has been carried out to ensure sufficient demand for the central \nheating and gas supplies generated by the Project. The risk of insufficient demand for the \n                                                 \n18  This includes Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, Fuxin,  Liaoyang, and Yingkou. ", "19 \nProject  is  minimal.  The  heating  supply,  the  CBM/CMM  development,  and  gas  distribution \nimprovement are to meet the existing demand and a small fraction of incremental demand in the \nproject  cities.  The  proposed  gas  tariff  adjustment  was  approved  in  principle  by  the  city \ngovernment and   was effective on 1  November 2004. The average heating tariff of about \nCNY20/m2 in Liaoning is not low and reflects economic supply cost. The expected improvement \nin facility efficiency by about 20% and billing collection to 95% under the Project will improve the \nPIAs\u2019 financial performance. Strong economic performance is expected in Liaoning, based on \nthe  PRC\u2019s  new  emphasis  on  the  economic  development  of  the  northeast  provinces \n(Heilongjiang, Jiling, and Liaoning). \n \n56.  The gas and central heating distribution systems under the Project are based on proven \ndesigns and conventional technologies that have been long used successfully in the PRC. No \nsignificant technical risks are anticipated. On a smaller scale, the transmission and distribution \nof CMM has been demonstrated as a viable activity in Liaoning. The CBM/CMM development, \nhowever, involves some technical risks such as the use of vertical wells to extract CBM/CMM \nfrom coal mines, which requires careful design, construction, and operation. The output of \nexisting pilot-testing wells met the PPTA consultants\u2019 expectations. Furthermore, this technology \nis worth developing in the PRC as the potential benefits substantially outweigh the risks. \nPrecautions will be taken to minimize potential risks during project construction and operation \nphases. The risk of delay to loan effectiveness and construction due to late internal approvals \nand procurement was addressed by early preparation and procurement training for all the PIAs \nin July 2004. The chance of large project cost savings will be minimal because of the recent \nupward trend  in the prices of construction materials  and a prudent cost estimate. GLP will \nmitigate the risk of inadequate project management by setting up the PMO with experienced \nprofessional staff who have had previous experience in design and construction supervision and \nprocurement. International and domestic consultants will also provide assistance in these areas \nIn addition, all of the PIAs will be subject to good governance supervision under the PPMS. \n \n57.  To fully assess the potential project risks, a probabilistic risk analysis was performed \nusing the Monte Carlo simulation technique based on 3,000 simulations for both the EIRR and \nFIRR analysis (Supplementary Appendix Q). The crucial risk variables were selected because \nof their significant impact on the project\u2019s economic and financial viability. The results indicate \nthat the expected EIRR, based on the weighted average of all simulated combinations, is \n25.3%, or about 1.0% lower than the base-case value, without consideration of project risks. \nThe probability of the EIRR falling below the cut-off rate of 12% is 0.3%. The economic risk is \nvery  low  because  the  Project  relies  on  existing  demand  and  benefits  from  efficiency \nimprovements. The results indicate that the expected FIRR is 8.6%, about 0.1% lower than the \nbase-case value, without consideration of project risks. The probability of the FIRR falling below \nthe WACC for the Project of 4.3% is 16.9%. \n \n58.  Poverty is associated with vulnerability. The dimension of risk in poverty assessment is \nof significance since the poor are the most vulnerable to unexpected unfavorable events. The \nexpected  poverty  impact  ratio  is  12.1%,  1.8%  lower  than  the  base-case  value,  without \nconsideration of project  risks, and still higher than the share of the poor in the project area. \nEven with pessimistic assumptions, the probability of a negative outcome for the poor is 6.7%. \nThe risk analysis on  the poverty impact ratio calculation, together with the analysis on the \nprobability of overall project failure (risk analysis on the EIRRs and FIRRs), concludes that that \nthe probability of negative outcomes for the poor is also minimal. \n   ", "20 \nV.

Energy Sector and Environment \n \n1.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has severe environmental problems, including air \npollution associated with rapid economic growth, heavy reliance on coal as the major fuel, use of \nobsolete equipment, and inappropriate planning associated with a centrally planned economy. \nEstimates of economic losses caused by pollution range from 3.5% to 8.3% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP). Pollution in the early 1990s resulted in annual economic losses of CNY99 billion \n(about 4% of GDP at the time), with air pollution accounting for 59%, water pollution 36%, and \nsolid waste 5%.1 The high economic losses reflect waste and inefficiency in the utilization of \nenergy, raw materials, and other resources in the production of goods and services. This is partly \na legacy of  the past practice of locating industrial enterprises in urban centers, inappropriate \nregulatory  measures,  and  pricing  policies  that  did  not  provide  adequate  incentives  for \nconservation and environmentally friendly behavior. With rapid economic growth, the use of \nenergy and raw materials will continue to grow in the PRC. Unless better technologies are used, \nswitching to cleaner fuels is encouraged, and the use of renewable energy is increased, air quality \nwill deteriorate and related economic losses will increase. Supplementary Appendix A provides \nadditional information. \n \n2.  The PRC's heavy reliance on coal as its primary fuel for industrial production, power \ngeneration, and commercial and residential applications, mainly heating and cooking, contributes \nsignificantly to emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO ) and total suspended particulates (TSP), and high \n2\nlevels of urban air pollution. Air quality is poor in most of the PRC\u2019s industrial cities. Liaoning \nprovince has air pollution problems due to heavy reliance on coal as the primary fuel for the large \nnumber of heavy industries in the province and for heating. Most urban heating is provided by \nsmall, inefficient, coal-fired heating boilers. These small boilers typically are not equipped with \nadequate pollution control devices, and have been the major sources of air pollution in urban \nareas in the province. Shenyang and Benxi in Liaoning province are among the most polluted \ncities in the world. Due to the Government\u2019s effort on environmental improvement, urban air \nquality has been slowly improving.  \n \nB.  Coal Subsector \n \n3.  The PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer with 2002 production of 1,393 million tons (t) \nof raw coal accounting for 28% of the world\u2019s total coal production. Coal provides more than three \nquarters of the energy for power generation, 65% of chemical raw materials, and more than half of \ncommercial and civilian energy. Coal accounts for 95% of the nation\u2019s primary fossil energy \nresources. Coal will continue to be the primary energy fuel in the PRC for the foreseeable future, \npartly because of increasing thermal power capacity. Coal production reached 1,400 million t in \n1996 and then gradually energy efficiency was improved and other sources of energy were \ndeveloped. Coal production was 1,000 million t in 2000 and increased to 1,667 million t in 2003. \nCoal production in Liaoning totaled 54 million t in 2000 and increased to 58 million t in 2003. \nLiaoning has over 1,300 active coal mines. State-owned coal mines account for 80% of coal \nproduction capacity. \n                                                 \n1   Based on a study by the Policy Research Center for Environment and Economy of the State Environmental \nProtection Administration. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \n \nC.  Gas Distribution \n \n4.  In the PRC, three types of gas are distributed: manufactured town gas,2 natural gas, and \nliquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG).  Liaoning  province  has  4,470  kilometers  (km)  of  town  gas \ndistribution  pipelines,  2,951  km  of  natural  gas  distribution  pipelines, and 195 km of LPG \ndistribution pipelines. The most important end uses for city gas are cooking, water heating, and \nspace heating to a lesser degree. In 2000, total city gas consumption in the PRC was 34 billion \ncubic meters (bcm), consisting of 15.2 bcm of coal gas, 8.2 bcm of natural gas, and 10.5 million t \nof liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). All the existing gas distribution systems are owned and \noperated by municipal gas companies under the control of city governments and under the \nsupervision of the Ministry of Construction at the national level. The gas prices for end use \nconsumers used to be subsidized before as a basic human need under the centrally planned \nsystem but have recently been adjusted nearer to market prices. The average gas price  in \nLiaoning, about CNY1.0/cubic meter (m3) (heat  value  of  5,000  kcal/m3), is comparable to \nCNY1.3/m3 (heat value of 8,000 kcal/m3) for many provinces in the PRC. Compared to coal, \ndistribution of gas is more convenient and less polluting. The growing demand for city gas has \nbeen outpacing supply. Total city gas demand is expected to grow to 100 bcm by 2010, almost \ntripling during the 2000 to 2010 period. \n \nD.  Urban Heating \n \n5.  Urban heating demand in the PRC has grown rapidly due to rising incomes, privatization \nof housing, and housing sector growth. In terms of heated areas, heating demand has increased \nby an annual average rate of 17% from 1992 to 2003. Urban heating demand had grown rapidly \nduring the past decade because of economic and housing growth and housing reforms that \npromoted private ownership. The total heated area of buildings in the PRC was only 328 million \nsquare meters (m2) in 1992 but more than quadrupled to 1,460 million m2 in 2002, equivalent to a \ncompound annual growth rate of 16.1%. Residential buildings account for about 70% of the total \nspace heating demand, and commercial and public buildings account for the remaining 30%. In \n2002,  30%  of  total  residential  buildings  were  served  by  combined  heat  and  power \ngeneration/urban central heating supply. This market penetration of central heating is relatively \nlow, compared to the 55% to 60% range in developed European countries such as Denmark and \nFinland. About 500,000 small coal-fired heating boilers still operate in the PRC. As part of its \nenergy efficiency and environmental improvement plan, the Government\u2019s policy promotes urban \ncentral heating supply  systems using heat supplied from efficient, large, combined heat and \npower generation plants and/or large heating boilers. Similar to the national trend, the heating \ndemand in Liaoning province has been growing rapidly in the past ten years. The total heated \nspace in the province grew at 13.6% per year, increasing from 69.8 million m2 in 1992 to \n220.5 million m2 in 2001. In Liaoning, the average heating tariff of about CNY20/m2 is the same as \nor comparable to the CNY20/m2 in Heilongjiang, CNY19.5 /m2 in Xinjiang, and CNY24/m2 in \nBeiijing. \n \nE.  Coal Bed Methane/Coal Mine Methane \n \n6.  Methane is part of coal\u2019s natural composition. In the PRC, many coal mines have a very \nhigh content of methane. The production of coal in the PRC results in the emission of methane as \na greenhouse gas into the atmosphere that could otherwise be used as an energy source. In the \n                                                 \n2   Town gas is either manufactured using low-grade coal or is a byproduct from the production of coke for metallurgical \npurposes. More recently, coal bed methane and coal mine methane captured during coal mining operations has also \nbeen supplied to urban communities through networks of pipes.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n \nPRC about 6 billion m3 of methane was released into the atmosphere in 2003 from coal mine \noperations. This figure is expected to reach 10 billion m3 by 2010. Liaoning province accounts for \nabout 20% of the nation\u2019s total coal bed methane (CBM)/coal mine methane (CMM) emissions. \nMethane, when released into the atmosphere, is about 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide \nas a greenhouse gas. To date in the PRC, only a few small-scale CBM/CMM development \nprojects have produced methane for power generation or distribution for household and industrial \nusers. Large commercial CBM/CMM projects would constitute a new environmentally friendly \nenergy source. The probable CBM/CMM within a depth of 2,000 meters in the PRC is 30 trillion to \n35 trillion m3. Development and utilization of CBM/CMM  would also help reduce coal mine \naccidents. In the PRC, about 80% of such accidents are attributable to methane explosions. In \n2002, 6,900 miners died in the PRC, including 266 in Liaoning province. \n \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \n \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE AND LESSONS LEARNED \n \nA.  External Assistance \n \n1.  External sources, including foreign direct investment, are increasingly being promoted \nand now finance about 20% of total annual investment in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nenergy sector, mainly in the power sector. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved \nabout $3.2 billion to the PRC energy sector to finance 25 projects in the public sector, and two \nprivate sector power projects. With regard to power projects, thermal power projects account for \n41% in terms of loan amount, with hydropower projects accounting for about 36%, followed by \ntransmission and distribution (about 17%), and renewable energy (about 6%). ADB has also \nprovided 67 technical assistance (TA) projects for the energy sector for about $32 million to help \nprepare projects, provide policy advice, and build the institutional capabilities of power utilities that \nare  the  executing  agencies  of  ADB  loans.  ADB  has  extended  nine  loans  amounting to \n$1.35 billion for urban environmental improvement projects in the PRC, including district heating \ndistribution  and  combined  heat  and  power  cogeneration  plants.  Four  projects  have  been \ncompleted and are in commercial operation resulting in improvement in the overall ambient air \nquality in the assisted cities.  \n \n2.  ADB has also provided a TA to support the Government\u2019s reform of heating tariffs.1 The \nobjective of the TA is to help the Government reform the urban heating sector and promote \nsustainable urban heating supply in the PRC by (i) formulating pro-poor national heating tariff \nguidelines, and (ii) establishing an effective heating tariff collection mechanism. The World Bank \nis also an important source of external funding for urban district heating. Since early 1990s, it has \nprovided over $600 million to finance environment improvement projects. The central heating \nsystem components of these projects helped reduce polluting emissions from small inefficient \ncoal-fired heating boilers. In recent years, the World Bank has also provided TA to support the \nGovernment\u2019s heating sector reforms. \n \n3.  Among bilateral sources, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is the \nlargest  source  of  external  assistance  for  the  power  sector  in  the  PRC.  It  has  provided \nconcessional loans totaling CNY438 billion ($3.6 billion at the current exchange rate) for 14 power \nsector projects through its official development assistance window. JBIC has also provided \nspecial credits to major cities to improve their environment by installing emission control devices \nand equipment in power plants and factories, and through building water treatment facilities. JBIC \nis considering shifting its traditional focus of assistance in the power sector from hydro and \nthermal power generation to energy conservation and renewable energy, particularly in the \nwestern  region.  Germany,  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  has  provided \napproximately $400 million in mixed credits, mostly for power plants and turbine modernization \nprojects. KfW has also supported the Government in energy efficiency and renewable energy \ndevelopment. Other bilateral sources providing export credits or mixed credits in the energy \nsector include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and United \nStates. \n \n4.  ADB has established a working relationship with the World Bank in addressing policy \nissues and coordinating lending and TA operations, and exchanges views with bilateral sources \nand the private sector. Both ADB and the World Bank have emphasized the importance of \nimproving the management of power utilities, tariff reform, energy efficiency improvement, \nenvironmental protection, and a greater role for the private sector. During the processing of the \nproposed Project, discussions were held with the World Bank, JBIC, and KfW to ensure that their \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Pro-poor Urban Heating Tariff Reforms. \nManila. The TA is nearly completed. \n ", "  Appendix 7  29 \n \nrespective activities are complementary and to maintain consistency in policy advice. Some \nadditional information is presented in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nB.  Lessons Learned \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s overall experience from energy and environment sector projects in the PRC has \nbeen  positive.  Projects  are  generally  well  designed  and  smoothly  implemented,  although \nsubstantial  difficulties  have  emerged  in  some  projects.  Success  is  attributed  to  extensive \npreparation prior to ADB intervention, high degree of local ownership, effective leadership in \nproject management offices (PMOs), timely policy and enterprise reforms, and fortunate market \nconditions. Delays in mobilizing counterpart funds are not uncommon, but in most cases have not \nresulted in unsatisfactory performance.  \n \n6.  Some problems in energy projects have arisen from inappropriate policies on energy \npricing, especially coal vs. natural gas (and urban heating), and enforcement of environmental \nprotection requirements. For instance, the Shaanxi Environment Improvement Project (Loan \n1543-PRC), in general, has been successfully implemented, but experienced the cancellation of \ntwo cogeneration subprojects due to fuel pricing considerations, i.e., while natural gas was the \nenvironmentally favored alternative, extant gas pricing would have required subsidies of 30\u201350% \nto achieve a positive financial internal rate of return.  \n \n7.  Persistent regulatory loopholes and weak enforcement of key provisions pose some \nproject risk: emissions fees for SO  and other waste gas emissions are still set below the marginal \n2\ncost  of  abatement,  making  it  cheaper  for  large  coal-fired power plants and synthetic gas \nproducers to pay the pollution discharge fees than to implement de-sulfurization methods. Waste \ncoal power plants are given some regulatory exemption from stack emissions standards, based \non the \u201ccomprehensive reutilization\u201d principle. Sustained enforcement of total emissions quotas \non  a  provincial  and  air-shed basis was at least partially successful in the late 1990s, but \nconstruction and operation of large coal-fired power plants in the project area may jeopardize the \nlong-range emissions control plan.  \n \n8.  Ongoing market reforms in gas and heating subsectors pose uncertainties in financial \nviability  of  project  enterprises,  particularly  state-owned  enterprises  in  the  early  stages  of \ncorporatization and commercialization. Ongoing environmental improvement projects (e.g., Loan \n1715-PRC and Loan 1890-PRC) illustrate that market reforms and material price volatility can \noutpace  project  implementation  with  two  extreme  outcomes:  (i) constraining  enterprise \nprofitability,  or  (ii) enterprise  mergers  and  acquisitions  may  accelerate  management  and \nownership reforms to the point that external support is not critical. A recent completed project \nperformance audit report of a similar environmental project (Loan 1270: Tangshan and Chende \nEnvironmental Improvement Project) identified several important lessons including choosing \nsuitable (not the most advanced) technology, integrated environmental and financial impacts, and \nemphasis on implementation.  \n \n9.  The above lessons have been taken into account in project design and preparation. The \nAir Pollution Control Law (amended in 2000\u20132001) provides a rational regulatory framework \npromoting clean energy development in an environmentally friendly manner. Coal mine methane \n(CMM) has been demonstrated as a viable energy source in Liaoning province. The proposed gas \nand heating and coal bed methane (CBM) will be developed to meet existing demand and a \nfraction  of  the  total  incremental  demand  in  the  project  cities.  Price  forecasts  have  been \nconservatively estimated. The PMO has sufficient experience as it  has just completed  the \nimplementation  of  a  loan  from  the  World  Bank.  Institutional  strengthening  of  the  project \nimplementation  agencies  will  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  loan-funded  investments. \nCoordination with the World Bank and JBIC is active and ongoing, eliminating any overlap in \nassistance. \n ", "30           Appendix 4\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\nEstimated Cost Total\nItem Contract/Package FC LC Cost\n$ million $ million $ million\nPart A: CMM/CBM Development 15.78 10.89 26.67\nA1 Fuxin CMM/CBM Development \n(i) CBM Surface Production Wells  3.26 2.91 6.17\n(ii) Underground CMM Recovery, Drainage, and Transmission   11.78 1.34 13.12\n(iv) Civil Works and Installation   0.54 6.65 7.19\n(v) Implementation Supervision Consulting Services  0.20 0.20\nSubtotal Component A1  15.78 10.89 26.67\nPart B: Gas Distribution Improvements 4.45 3.33 7.78\nB1  Fushun Gas Distribution Improvements      \n(i) Gas Pipelines and Pressure Regulating Stations  0.98 0.98\n(ii) Civil works and Pipeline Installations  0.67 0.73 1.40\n(iii) Implementation Supervision Consultants and Training   0.05 0.05\nSubtotal Component B1 1.70 0.73 2.43\nB2  Benxi Gas Distribution Improvements       \n(i) Gas Pipelines and Pressure Regulating Stations  2.30 2.30\n(ii) Civil Works and Pipeline Installations  0.34 2.60 2.94\n(iii) Implementation Supervision Consultants and Training   0.11 0.11\nSubtotal Component B2  2.75 2.60 5.35\nPart C: City Central Heating Supply 41.61 58.62 100.22\nC1 Anshan Central Heating Supply \n(i) Heat Transmission and Distribution Pipes   8.54 0.20 8.74\n(ii) Civil works   0.68 0.97 1.65\n(iii) Consumer Connection Modernization    3.87 3.87\n(iv) Implementation Supervision Consultants and Training   0.22 0.22\nSubtotal Component C1  9.44 5.04 14.47\nC2 Liaoyang Central Heating Supply \n(i) Heat Source (boilers and auxiliaries) 7.58 1.51 9.09\n(ii) Heating Transmission and Distribution Pipeline  4.84 10.43 15.27\n(iii) Civil Works  1.33 5.56 6.89\n(iv) Implementation supervision consultants and training   0.27 0.27\n(v) Other Costs (land acquisition, site preparation, etc.) 4.55 4.55\nSubtotal Component C2  14.02 22.05 36.06\nC3 Yinkou Central Heating Supply\n(i) Heat Source (boilers) 2.01 1.68 3.69\n(ii) Steam Turbine-Generator Set 5.37 5.37\n(iii) Hotwater and Steam Pipelines  5.08 8.89 13.97\n(iv) Civil works and Preconstruction Works  15.61 15.61\n.

Summary of Past and Projected Financial Performance of Project Enterprises \n \n1.  The historical and projected financial statements of the project enterprises for the period \n1999\u20132009 are in Supplementary Appendix K and are summarized in Table A7.1. \n \n1.  Fuxin Coalbed/Coalmine Methane Development and Utilization Company \n \n2.  The  Fuxin  Coalbed  Methane  (CBM)/Coalmine  Methane  (CMM)  Development  and \nUtilization Company (FXDUC) is a wholly owned subsidiary company of Fuxin Mining Group \nCorporation Ltd. (FXMGC), a state-owned enterprise (SOE). FXDUC presently undertakes \nCBM/CMM operations. FXDUC started production in 2000 but the volumes have not been \nsignificant (development stage) with small losses or breakeven results. With the increase in \nCBM/CMM operations and a good market for gas, projections for FXDUC are expected to meet \nfinancial targets. \n \n2.  Fushun Gas General Company \n \n3.  The Fushun Gas  General Company (FGC) is an SOE, created in 1949. FGC\u2019s core \nbusiness is supplying coal gas mostly to residential consumers in the city. In 2003, the volume of \ngas supplied was 53 million cubic meters (m3); it also supplied 15,940 tons of liquefied petroleum \ngas. FGC has eight business units including two independent subsidiary companies and employs \n1,293 staff, 580 of whom are female. Its total assets as of end-2003 were CNY123.3 million. FGC \nhas registered net losses over the last 5 years. FGC cited low gas tariffs, which have been kept \nconstant for the last 6 years, and poor management during the transition from a government \nagency to an independent public utility, as the main reasons for the losses. The company has \napplied for a tariff rate increase, which was approved for implementation from November 2004. \nThis tariff increase, together with reduction of distribution losses and improvement of operation \nefficiency, is expected to reverse the company\u2019s losses and to meet financial targets. \n \n3.  Benxi Gas General Company \n \n4.  The Benxi Gas General Company (BGC) is an SOE, established in 1974. BGC\u2019s core \nbusiness is to supply coal or natural gas mostly to residential consumers in the city. In 2003, \n39 million m3 was supplied to a customer base of 140,000 households. BGC has 10 business \nunits including two independent subsidiary companies and employs 887 staff, 350 of whom are \nfemale. Its total assets as of the end of 2003 were CNY185.6 million. Over the last 5 years, BGC\u2019s \noperations have shown breakeven results, with sales revenues just sufficient to cover operating \nexpenses. Despite the minimal net income realized by BGC, the company has a healthy cash \nposition as its debt is kept at a low level, with its assets mostly funded by equity. In Benxi, gas is \nsupplied from a local steel mill and the city government has agreed to pass through any future \nprice increase. With the Project, BGC will be able to meet the financial targets with the efficiency \nimprovement and reduction in distribution losses under the Project. \n \n4.  Anshan General Heating Company \n \n5.   Anshan General Heating Company (AGHC) is an SOE. Its core business is supplying heat \nto consumers in the city. AGHC was established in April 1981. In 1987, its annual government \nsubsidies were canceled and AGHC became an independent enterprise responsible for its own \nincome and profits. It provided heat to 9.27 million square meters (m2) of floor space by the end of \n ", "36  Appendix 7 \n \n2003. AGHC has 13 affiliate and subsidiary companies and employs 2,268 staff, 814 of whom are \nfemale. Its total assets as of end-2003 were CNY479.5 million. AGHC realized modest profits \n(about 1% of sales) in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, the company incurred losses equivalent to 8% of \nsales. The main reason for the loss was in a one-time financial change, in which uncollected \naccounts were written off and not recognized as revenues for the year. In 2003, there was another \naccounting change resulting in losses (32% of sales). The main reasons for low profitability are \npoor collection, operational inefficiency, and expenditure related to  its social role. With the \nadditional volume of heat that can be recovered and generated, and improvements in efficiency \nand bill collection, profitability is expected to improve. \n \n5.  Benxi General Heating Company \n \n6.  The Benxi General Heating Company (BGHC) is an SOE. Its core business is supplying \nheat to consumers in the city. In 1999, BGHC was established through the merger of the Benxi \ncity\u2019s main heating supply station and other smaller heating departments. In 2003, BGHC \nsupplied to 70,000 households with a total heating area of 3.9 million m2. BGHC has six \nsubsidiary companies and employs 1,077 staff, 320 of whom are female. Its total assets as of \nend-2003 were CNY301.8 million. BGHC had a negative operating income for 2 years from 2000. \nWith income generated from connection fees collected from new customers, it had modest net \nincomes, increasing to about 10% of sales in 2002 and 2003. The main reason for low profitability \nis poor collection. Additional operating assets were transferred from Benxi city government in \n2002. The expected increase in sales due to new connections when 63 independent small boilers \nare shut down, expected efficiency improvement, heating tariff reforms, and improved collection \nwill  improve  BGHC\u2019s  financial  performance.  The  financial  targets  agreed  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will be met based on the conservative financial projections. \n \n6.  Liaoyang Real Estate Heat Company \n \n7.  The Liaoyang Real Estate Heating Company (LREHC) is an SOE, with a core business of \nsupplying heat to consumers in the city. LREHC was established in April 1984. In 2003, heat was \nsupplied  to  40,000  houses  with  3 million  m2  of  heating  area.  LREHC  has  five  subsidiary \ncompanies and employs 448 staff. Its total assets as of end-2003 were CNY359.0 million. LREHC \nregistered positive financial results in the last 5 years of operation. The company does not have \nany long-term debt and all  the  assets  transferred  to it by Liaoyang city government were \nconsidered as equity. The large increase in the consumer base when 174 independent small \nboilers are shut down, expected efficiency improvement, heating tariff reforms, and improved \ncollection will further improve LREHC\u2019s financial performance to meet the financial targets. \n \n7.  Yingkou Heating Company \n \n8.  The Yingkou Heating Company (YHC) is an SOE. YHC was established in July 1993, and \nsupplies heat to the eastern and western areas of the city. In 2003, YHC served 25,000 \nhouseholds and supplied heat to a total area of 2.3 million m2, about half of the city\u2019s total heating \narea. YHC has six subsidiary companies and employs 499 staff, 212 of whom are female. Its total \nassets as of end-2003 were CNY195.0 million. Operations from 1999 to 2003 resulted in small \nincome or losses amounting to less than 1% of sales. Poor collection was cited as the main \nconcern resulting in direct write-off of some accounts. In 2002, connection fees were allocated to \nYHC by Yinkou city government, which offset the operating losses incurred in that year. The large \nincrease in the consumer base when 175 independent small boilers are shut down, expected \nefficiency improvement, heating tariff reforms, and improved collection will improve YHC\u2019s \nfinancial performance to meet the financial targets. \n ", "      Appendix 7  37 \n \nB.  Assumptions Used for Financial Projections \n \n9.  The  financial  operations  of  the  project  companies  were  projected  for  the  period \n2005\u20132014. Their financial performance in the next 10 years will likely improve as a result of \nimproved market environment,  GLP\u2019s  effort  to  clean  urban  air  pollution, the financial and \ninstitutional reforms and facility improvement under the Project. Gas tariffs are assumed at the \ncurrent levels and the approved adjustments. The heating tariffs are assumed at the current levels \nand the proposed adjustments in the Tariff Reform Action Plan, in particular the implementation of \na two-part heating tariffs. Based on actions being taken by the project implementation agencies \n(PIAs),  the  levels  and  structure  of  the  tariffs  are  considered  reasonable.  Operation and \nmaintenance expenses are projected to increase in line with sales, assets in operation, and \ninflation. The operating ratio and the net profit margin are forecast to improve to satisfy the \nproposed minimum rate of return requirements. \n \n10.  The projected financial performance included the implementation and operation of the \nProject. The PIAs will be required to meet financial targets agreed with ADB. To ensure that this \nset of financial covenants is translated into appropriate financial policies and measures, the PIAs \nwill provide ADB each year with rolling 10-year financial projections, showing how they propose to \nmeet the covenanted targets. The financial covenants of ADB are expected to be satisfied during \nthe life of the Project. The debt service coverage ratio is forecast to be adequate throughout. The \ndebt-equity ratio will also be within  the prescribed maximum limit. Other financial ratios are \nexpected to remain satisfactory. The capital investment programs of the PIAs consider their \nongoing investments and the Project, adjusted to reflect projected annual escalation factors used \nin ADB projects. The revenue projections are based on the growth forecast prepared by the PIAs. \nThe projections use an exchange rate of CNY8.30/$1.00. \n \n11.  Revenues are calculated from the volume of gas and heat sales and the average tariffs \nper m3 of gas and kilojoules (kJ) of heat sold. The tariff rates are based on the tariff schedule \nprevailing in 2004 and some tariff adjustments required under the Tariff Reforms Action Plan \nagreed with ADB. The CBM/CMM cost was based on the agreed transfer price between the \nmining company and FXDUC. For the gas distribution companies, the purchase cost of gas was \nconsidered. For heating, the current production cost of heat was maintained. Depreciation was \ncalculated on a straight-line basis using the estimated remaining life of the fixed assets. No \nsalvage value was considered. Annual operation and maintenance costs include the following: \nmaintenance costs estimated based on the value of gross fixed assets at 2.5%; personnel costs \nestimated based on an average annual salary of CNY10,000 per employee plus 14% in welfare \nbenefits; materials cost estimated based on historical consumption; plus a certain assumed level \nfor administrative and other costs.  \n \n12.  Interest expenses on existing long-term debts are calculated based on the loan terms. The \ntaxable income of the PIAs is subject to 33% income tax, and losses for the past 5 years are \nallowed as deductions. The value-added tax for gas and heat sales is 13% and sales tax of 10% of \nvalue-added tax is levied. Accounts receivables are estimated based on the number of days of \nequivalent sales revenues existing in 2003, declining to reflect improved collection efficiency \nassociated with the heating tariff reforms. Accounts payables are estimated to be 2 months\u2019 cash \noperating expenses. \n \n ", "38         Appendix 7\nTable A7.1: SUMMARY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS\n(CNY million)\nActual

Introduction \n1.  This appendix summarizes the benefits, adverse effects, and recommended mitigation \nand monitoring measures related to the construction and operation of the Liaoning Environmental \nImprovement Project (the Project) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).  It is based on \nenvironmental examinations and assessments prepared for individual subcomponents which \ninclude field sampling and assessment, interviews, and analysis of secondary data. \n \nB.  Project Description \n2.  The Project includes: (i) improved and expanded coal mine methane (CMM) and coal bed \nmethane (CBM)1 production in Fuxin city, totaling 46 million cubic meters per year (m3/y); \n(ii) rehabilitation and expansion of gas transmission and distribution networks in Benxi and \nFushun cities; and (iii) construction and operation of central heating systems in the cities of \nAnshan,  Benxi,  Liaoyang,  and  Yingkou  to  replace  small  coal-fired  heating  boilers;  and \n(iv) institutional reforms and corporate governance improvement of the project implementation \nagencies (PIAs). \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n3.  Liaoning  province  is  located  on  the  northeast  coast  of  the  Asian  continent  at \n118o51'\u2013125o47' E and 38o43'\u201343o29' N with a width of 374 kilometers (km) from east to west and \n530 km from south to north. The climate is continental monsoon, with mean annual precipitation \nfrom 1,200 millimeters (mm) to 400 mm, decreasing from the southeast to northwest. The average \nannual temperature is 10.1oC. Natural resources include coal, iron, limestone, and petroleum. \nAgricultural products include oil plants, fruits, rice, corn, apples, pears, peanuts, and other cash \ncrops. Liaohe oil field is the third largest in the PRC, with crude oil and natural gas reserves that \naccount for 15% and 10% of the total of the PRC, respectively. Despite having significant energy \nresources, the project area is a net energy importer. Conventional petroleum and natural gas \nreserves  are  declining,  and  coal  production  is  insufficient  to  meet  energy  demand  in  an \nenvironmentally acceptable manner. Liaoning is a traditional heavy industrial base of the PRC, \nwith severe air, water, and soil pollution. Air pollution has been improving in the project area, but \ndoes not yet meet the designated ambient quality standards on a year-round basis. The ambient \ntotal suspended particulates (TSP) level exceeds PRC Grade II standards in all the project cities; \nambient sulfur dioxide (SO ) concentrations frequently exceed Grade II standards. \n2\n \n4.  The project area is mostly urbanized and industrialized, with some land still utilized for \nagriculture. No cultural or historic structures or features are known to exist in the project area. \nOngoing ecological improvements include: creation of approximately 5,800 hectares of green \nspace in urban areas; planting of 1.5 billion trees; and establishment of 45 nature protection \nreserves, accounting for 7.4% of the total area of the province. The provincial population in 2003 \nwas 41.61 million, of which 90.9% was in urban areas. Provincial gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrew 10.2 % per year in real terms from 1990 to 1995, and 8.6% per year from 1996 to 2000. In \n2003, GDP was CNY600.25 billion, and the per capita GDP was CNY14,426. GDP grew by 7.2% \nin 2001 8.4% in 2002 and 11.5% in 2003. In the project area, there are  seven provincially \ndesignated poverty counties. In 2003, the urban disposable per capita income was CNY7,241, \n                                                 \n1   Coal mine methane (CH ) is a gas produced by in-mine drilling and drainage; coal bed methane is produced from \n4\nsurface wells drilled into unmined coal seams. \n ", "  Appendix 8  41 \n \nand the rural poor per capita income was CNY2,934. The registered urban unemployment rate \nwas 6.7%, but the effective rate may be higher. In 2001, 1.06 million citizens enjoyed social \nsecurity benefits. In 2003, about 1.6 million citizens received social security benefits.  \n \nD.  Anticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n5.  The Project is designed to reduce air pollution emissions, both regional and indoor, by \nexpanding  clean  energy  supplies  and  improving  energy  efficiency.  Except  for  short-term \ndisruptions during construction, no negative impacts directly due to project design, location, and \noperations have been identified. Project impacts, mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, \nand  reporting  responsibilities  are  summarized  in  Table  A8.  Gas  leakage  from  pipeline \ntransmission and distribution systems will be reduced, as will explosion hazards associated with \ncoal mining and gas transmission and distribution. CMM will be produced from existing mines, \nand CBM will be produced from new surface wells; new mining is not required. Enhanced CMM \nand CBM production will reduce mine explosion hazards by reducing the amount of methane gas \nin the mine working space. Methane and hydrogen sulfide (HS) are monitored by automated \n2\nsystems that trigger alarms when methane concentration in the air is within explosive limits and \nwhen HS is above designated workplace safety limits. Regional air quality will improve with the \n2\nclosure of small, inefficient, coal-fired boilers, more efficient gas transmission and distribution \nsystems, and reduced coal use. The following reduction of coal consumption and emissions will \nbe achieved: (i) coal savings of 217,500 tons per year (t/y); (ii) TSP of 18,800 t/y; (iii) SO of 2,600 \n2 \nt/y; (iv) nitrogen oxides (NO ) of 1,700 t/y; and (vi) greenhouse gas of CO  equivalent by 840,900 \nx 2\nt/y. Water and soil pollution will be indirectly reduced due to a lower rate of pollutant transfer from \nair to water and soil, with reduced stress on local ecosystems. \n \n6.  Construction traffic, excavation and earthmoving, and aggregate processing facilities will \ngenerate  dust,  which  will  be  suppressed  with  routine  measures  (e.g.,  water  sprays  on \nconstruction sites and roads, tarpaulins to cover trucks hauling raw materials). Construction \nvehicles and stationary equipment for aggregate processing and concrete mixing will meet \nexisting PRC emissions and noise standards. Construction activity in urban areas and near \nsensitive receptors (schools, hospitals, etc.) will be limited to daylight hours; additional noise \nabatement measures such as temporary barriers will be constructed as necessary to meet \nnational and local standards. Traffic and communications may be occasionally disrupted during \nconstruction of the pipelines and the CBM/CMM stations. The city construction companies have \nsubstantial experience in minimizing the potential for and managing the occurrence of epidemic \ndiseases in the project area. \n \n7.  Resettlement and land acquisition requirements have been quantified and presented in \nAppendix 9 and Supplementary Appendix M. A total of 412 small boilers in Benxi, Liaoyang, and \nYingkou will be closed, affecting 1,874 workers.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s  social protection \nstrategy, GLP and the PIAs will ensure that all 1,874 workers affected by the closure are \nreemployed in a timely manner and in accordance with the reemployment action plan prepared by \nthe PIAs (Supplementary Appendix F), so that they will be at least as well off as they would have \nbeen in the absence of the Project. Employment opportunities for local people are estimated to be \n1,350 full-time individuals. The Project will generate thousands of person-years of unskilled labor. \n \n8.  Project Alternatives. Without the Project, the area will continue to rely on coal as the \nprimary energy source for heating and residential use. Conventional natural gas reserves are \ninsufficient to meet increasing clean energy demands. Hydropower resources are limited. Other \nrenewable energy options have yet to be demonstrated on a commercial scale. Demand-side \n ", "42  Appendix 8 \n \nmanagement measures will continue to be driven by market forces, but will be insufficient in the \nnear-term to offset increasing energy demands. CMM and CBM are readily available alternatives, \nthe supply of which can be expanded through improved production methods. Improved utilization \nof coal in modern central heating systems is the most practical method of providing space heating; \ndesign considerations will result in provision of steam for industrial users. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n9.  Construction contractors will be required to provide basic sanitation facilities, domestic \nsewage treatment, solid waste management, noise and dust control, and personal protective \nequipment  for  workers,  and  to  conduct  noise  and  dust  monitoring  at  construction  sites. \nConstruction  equipment  must  meet  relevant  PRC  emissions  and  noise  standards.  Local \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  (EPBs)  will  be  responsible  for  routine  monitoring  of \nconstruction activities, as well as conducting routine air and water monitoring at designated \nmonitoring stations. The Liaoning provincial EPB will be responsible for oversight of local EPBs \nand will review data from construction contractors and local EPBs to determine if environmental \nrequirements are being met. The project management office (PMO) will designate at least one \nsuitably qualified professional staff member to serve as an environmental officer for the Project. \nThe PMO will be responsible for compiling progress reports for submittal to ADB twice a year. \nProject impacts, mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, and reporting responsibilities are \nsummarized in Table A8. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n10.  Environmental  evaluations  and  assessments  were  prepared  for  each  project \nsubcomponent, and included at least one public consultation for each subcomponent, primarily \nvia surveys in affected areas. Survey results indicated strong local support for the Project, based \non improved energy services, improved air quality and local ecological conditions, and expected \neconomic benefits (e.g., potential employment opportunities). \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n11.  The Project will improve and expand clean energy supplies, improve energy efficiency, \nimprove regional and indoor air quality, and reduce the explosion hazards associated with \nmethane gas production, transmission, and distribution. Global environmental benefits will be \nrealized via expanded CMM production, capture and utilization of vented methane, and improved \nenergy efficiency, which will result in reduction of methane and CO emissions. The anticipated \n2 \nimpacts arise primarily from construction activities, and can be readily mitigated with good \nengineering practice and active environmental management. The Liaoning provincial EPB will \nassume a lead role in assuring that the environmental management program is fully implemented. \nLocal EPBs in each project city will be responsible for routine monitoring and oversight. \n \nH.  Conclusions \n12.  The environmental examinations and assessments being conducted are adequately \nevaluating the potential impacts of the Project. The  Executing Agency  completed all of the \nenvironmental assessments required by the PRC Government, and the relevant authorities have \napproved the environmental examinations and assessment reports for project subcomponents. \nBased on knowledge of project design, impacts, mitigation measures, and institutional capacity, \nenvironmental Category B is appropriate. \n \n ", "", "", "  Appendix 9  45 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n1.  The Liaoning Environmental Improvement Project is composed of four main components \nwith seven subcomponents. Only one subcomponent, the Fuxin Coal Bed Methane and Coal \nMine Methane (CBM/CMM) Development, involves some minor land acquisition and temporary \nland  use  impacts.  Three households  will  permanently  lose  part  of  their  farmland  and \n46 households will have part of their farmland temporarily occupied during construction. Because \nno houses or structures will be demolished, therefore, no households need to be relocated. Based \non the number of the affected persons (APs) and the minor degree of impacts, the resettlement \nimpacts are classified as  nonsignificant. Consequently, a short resettlement plan has been \nprepared for this subproject (Supplementary Appendix M). The land acquisition and resettlement \nplan is designed to ensure that the APs will be better off as a result of the Project. The \nresettlement impacts of the Project by subcomponent are summarized in Tables A9.1 and A9.2. \nLess than 1 hectare (ha) of land will be permanently acquired and the temporary occupation about \n105 ha of land/roadways will require compensation for disruption of current land use. About 20 ha \nof industrial land owned by the project implementation  agencies (PIAs) will also be affected \ntemporarily. \n \nTable A9.1: Potential Resettlement Impacts of Project \nSubcomp\nComponent  Activities with Potential Resettlement Impacts \nonent \n    -  22 extraction wells require minor land acquisition (about 300 m2 each) \nCBM/CMM  Fuxin City   -  3 above-ground methane gas storage tanks and 3 gathering stations \nDevelopment  require minor land acquisition (extra 100 m2 for each) \n-  Gathering lines require temporary farmland disturbance for one month \nduration \n-  50 km of newly constructed main pipeline between Qinghemen and \nFuxin requires some temporary land disturbance alongside the main \nroad, compensation to be paid to the civil engineering department \nGas  Fushun  -  Replacement of 15.5 km of pipes will cause minor temporary road \nDistribution  City  disruption of pedestrian road and lawn, compensation for pedestrian \nImprovement  road restoration to be paid to the municipal civil engineering \ndepartment, and compensation for lawn restoration to be paid to \nmunicipal landscaping administration department \nBenxi City  -  Replacement of 43 km of old pipes and construction of 5 km of new \npipes will cause some temporary disturbance along urban roads, \ncompensation to be paid to the civil engineering department \nCity  Central  Benxi City  -  Construction of 7 km pipeline will cause some temporary disturbance \nHeating  along urban roads, compensation to be paid to the civil engineering \nSupply  department \nAnshan  -  Rehabilitation of existing facilities requires no land acquisition or \nCity  disturbance; no compensation will be required \nLiaoyang  -  Construction of 4.2 km of heat distribution network and 55 heat \nCity  exchange stations will cause minor disturbance along urban roads, \ncompensation to be paid to the municipal civil engineering department \nYingkou  -  Construction of 12 heat exchange stations and 40 km of heat supply \nCity  pipelines will cause minor disturbance along urban roads, \ncompensation to be paid to the municipal civil engineering department \nCBM = coal bed methane, CMM = coal mine methane, km = kilometer, m2 = square meter. \nSource: Project implementing agencies feasibility studies. \n \n2.  The total cost of land compensation and resettlement for all subprojects is estimated to be \nCNY36.5 million ($4.4 million equivalent). Since there are only a few APs, a small share of this \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \n \ncost will go to farmers. The majority of compensation will go to agencies like the civil engineering \ndepartment  and  landscaping  administration  department,  to  compensate  for  temporary \ndisturbance and road/sidewalk and lawn restoration. \n \nTable A9.2: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts  \n  Temporary Land Occupation (ha)     \n  Permanent \n  Land  Land  Total \nProject Component [xx   Acquisition  Urban  Owned  Affected  Budget \nSubcomponent?]   (ha)  Dryland  Road  by PIAs  Total  People  (CNY\u2019000) \nFuxin CBM/CMM Development  0.4  7.4  0.0  3.3  10.7  142  1,451 \nFushun Gas Distribution  0.0  0.0  3.3  0.0  3.3  0  6,047 \nImprovementa \nBenxi Gas Distribution  0.0  0.0  72.7  0.0  72.7  0  8,400 \nImprovement \nBenxi Central Heating Supply  0.0  0.0  4.0b  4.5  8.5  0  6,000 \nAnshan Central Heating Supply  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0  0 \nLiaoyang Central Heating Supply  0.0  0.0  4.0  1.3c  5.3  0  6,000 \nYingkou Central Heating Supply  0.0  0.0  14.0  10.9d  24.9  0  8,600 \nTotal  0.4  7.4  98.0  20.0  125.4  142  36,498 \n \nCBM = coal bed methane, CMM = coal mine methane, ha = hectare, PIA = project implementation agency. \na   The compensation for pedestrian road recovery will be CNY4.44 million, asphalt road will be CNY1.553 million, \nwhich will be paid to the Municipal Civil Engineering Department, and the compensation for lawn recovery will be \nCNY36,000 and bushes will be CNY19,900, paid to Municipal Landscaping Administration Department. \nb  Including 10 mu of wasteland. \nc  The land was purchased from Liaoyang Commerce Bureau by the Liaoyang Real Estate Heating Co. in 2002.

Resettlement for the Fuxin CBM/CMM Development Subcomponent. Efforts were \nmade in close consultation with local officials and village committees/street committees during the \nproject  proposal  and  feasibility  study  stages  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. The compensation of the permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration \nLaw of PRC, 1998 and the Liaoning Provincial Land  Administration Regulations issued on \n31 January 2002. Also, the resettlement plan was prepared in accordance with the policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement (1995) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Based on consultations \nwith local governments and APs, and general practice in Fuxin city, compensation standards and \nrates were formulated. For permanent land acquisition, a total of 21 times average annual output \nvalue (AAOV) will be provided with 10 times AAOV for land compensation, 10 times AAOV for \nresettlement subsidy, and 1 times AAOV for green crop compensation. The total compensation \nrate will be CNY315,000/ha (21,000/mu), which is for dryland. Compensation for land acquisition \nwill be paid to the village collective. Due to the small amount of land acquisition, either land will be \nadjusted within the village group or cash compensation will be provided to the affected household \nor the affected village collective that loses the land. The resettlement subsidy will be paid directly \nto the land user (i.e., household or collective). Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and \nother assets (e.g., trees, fences) will also be paid directly to the APs. For temporary land \noccupation land, CNY11.5/m2 (7,667/mu) will be paid for compensation, of which CNY1.5/ m2 \n(1,000/mu) goes to affected farmers and CNY10/m2 (6,667/mu) is paid as a fee to the township \ngovernment. The APs were notified about the key elements of the resettlement plan on various \noccasions during meetings, interviews, and socioeconomic surveys. A resettlement information \nbooklet (RIB) was distributed to all affected households in November 2003. The socioeconomic \nsurvey of 20 households identified some poor and potentially vulnerable households, some of \n ", "  Appendix 9  47 \nthem ethnic minority families. CNY5,000/household will be provided to any vulnerable household \nthat is affected as additional financial assistance. \n \n4.  The Fuxin  CBM/CMM Development  and  Utilization  Company (FXDUC) will be fully \nresponsible for implementation, financing, and monitoring of land acquisition, compensation, and \nrehabilitation.  It  will  work  closely  with  affected  township  and  village  officials  who  will  be \nresponsible for administering land transfer and compensation payments. The grievance-redress \nprocedures are well established and explanations are included in the resettlement information \nbooklet provided to all APs and villages. The preliminary cost estimate for the resettlement plan \nprogram is CNY1.45 million, equivalent to $175,000,  including  contingencies.  Resettlement \nimplementation will commence in January 2005 and be completed once the pipelines are installed \n(expected by July 2006).  \n \n5.  There will be internal and external monitoring of the implementation of the resettlement \nplan. Monitoring requirements are specified in the resettlement plan. Internal supervision and \nmonitoring will be done by FXDUC to ensure compliance with the provisions of the resettlement \nplan. The Executing Agency will ensure that resettlement progress is reported to ADB as part of \nquarterly progress reporting. When resettlement activities have been completed, FXDUC will \nprepare a resettlement completion report for submission to ADB. External monitoring and \nevaluation will be carried out by a social specialist under the project loan. Monitoring and \nevaluation reports will be prepared for 2005 and 2006, and submitted to ADB by 15 April the \nfollowing year. The Executing Agency  and ADB have agreed on a set of supervision milestones, \nwhich need to be in effect to ensure timely and effective implementation of resettlement activities \n(Table A9.3). \n \nTable A9.3: Resettlement Supervision Milestones for the Project \nNo.  Resettlement Task  Target  Responsible Agency  Deadline  Status \n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national   Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?     priority in country poverty partnership   \n    No  agreement?    No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in PRC: \n \nIn line with the Government\u2019s energy sector strategy to promote socioeconomic development and to meet the basic \nneeds of the poor, increased clean gas and central heating supplies are needed to support the national poverty reduction \nprogram. Adequate and reliable gas and central heating supplies are essential to human well-being in the cold northern \nprovinces. Gas and central heating supply will reduce coal and wood burning that cause serious environmental and \nair-related diseases in the project areas. The poor, women, and children can be particularly vulnerable as they tend to be \nexposed more extensively to urban pollution than other population classes. A better urban environment can improve the \nlocal investment climate to attract more investment to the region and promote the development of the industry and \nservices sectors. Through careful design of project subcomponents and active policy dialogue, this Project provides \nspecific gas and central heating assistance programs to the poor so they can have reliable gas and central heating \nsupplies in the winter. The Project will improve the safety of coal miners and improve the quality of life for the local \npeople. Overall, the gas and central heating supplies of the Project will complement poverty reduction efforts in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis       Targeting Classification: General intervention \nPoverty analysis has been treated as an integral part of project design and based on quantitative and qualitative \nmethodologies. The project planning and design have made use of poverty data at the national, provincial, municipal, \nand subproject levels and involved field poverty assessments, questionnaire surveys, and stakeholder consultations, \nincluding with the project beneficiaries. Participatory methods were used to identify the local poor population and the \nprovisions that would help to improve the quality of their lives. Active policy dialogue led to the development of a poverty \nreduction and social strategy that includes the following components: \n \n1. Providing efficient and environmentally compatible gas and central heating supplies to the poor. The Project \nwill directly benefit a total urban population of about 2.7 million in the 6 project beneficiary areas of Fushun, Fuxin, \nBenxi, Anshan, Liaoyang, and Yingkou. Of the total beneficiaries, about 1.9 million urban residents will benefit from \nthe gas supply and 0.8 million from central heating supply.  About 199,800 persons or about 7.4% of the total \nbeneficiaries are the poor as measured by the various city poverty lines. The increased use of gas and heating \nsupplies (including the closure of 412 small inefficient coal-fired boilers in Benxi, Liaoyang, and Yingkou) will reduce \nthe use of coal, wood, and coal briquettes that causes environmental and health impacts, particularly for the poor. The \nProject will indirectly benefit the entire urban population residing in the six project cities. \n \n2.  Creating jobs for the poor. The Project will create about 7,280 person-years of employment opportunities during the \nconstruction phase and 1,940 full-time jobs during the operation of the Project. Of these, 2,910 person-years of \nemployment opportunities will be filled by the poor, women, and minorities, earning CNY27.96 million in wage \npayments during the project construction period. An additional 780 full-time operational employment opportunities or \nCNY8.38 million of wage payment per year are expected to go to the poor, women, and minorities. In addition, local \nprocurement of the materials required for the Project is expected to create additional jobs. By increasing gas and \ncentral heating supplies to local residents, industries, commercial users and public institutions, the Project will result in \nimprovement of the socioeconomic infrastructure of the project area. \n \n3. Reducing environmental impacts on the poor. Through the development of methane gas supply, improved and \nincreased gas and central heating supplies, and closure of 412 small, inefficient and polluting coal-fired boilers, the \nProject will reduce air emissions of SO , CO , NO , TSP, and solid wastes in the project areas. This will result in \n2 2 x\ntremendous socioeconomic and environmental benefits to the local communities and populations. A better urban \nenvironment can improve the local investment climate to attract more investment to the region and stimulate growth in \nreal estate, services, recreation and tourism. This economic development will increase employment opportunities and \nincome for the local population. Improving air quality will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of air-related diseases \nand associated medical costs, and loss of healthy working days in the project area. The poor, elderly, children, and \nwomen who have less coping resources and are more vulnerable, will benefit disproportionately from the reduction in \nair emissions. In particular, women usually spend more time than men on cooking; the length of their exposure to \nsmoke is higher than men. As such the Project will benefit women more than men. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  49 \n \n4.  Improving occupational safety of miners. The CBM/CMM development subcomponent of the Project and the \nstrengthened coal mine safety programs committed by the project implementation agency (PIA) will improve the \ncoal mine safety at the project sites. In nonquantifiable terms, improved mine safety will prevent family members \nbecoming poor if a serious accident occurs. \n \n5. Enhancing quality of life for the poor. Survey results show that majority of the urban residents believe that the \nincrease of gas and heating supply will improve the overall quality of life, reduce the housework for women, decrease \nhealth problems, increase comfort and entertainment activities, and facilitate longer study in winter. \n \n6. Implementing gas and heating assistance programs for the poor. The average heating expenditure burden (the \nratio of heating expenditure and the household\u2019s monthly income) of the poor in the project areas is high. A typical poor \nhousehold living in a 40 square meter apartment unit in the project cities has a heating expenditure burden in the range \nof 21% to 27% of its total household expenditure. Through policy dialogue, the project cities and the PIAs have agreed \nto two specific programs to help the poor to pay for gas supply and winter heating. These programs will ensure the \nmaximum amount for gas or central heating that a poor household as defined by the city poverty line, will pay is about \n5% of the household\u2019s monthly income. The PIAs will provide connection fee and tariff discounts to the poor. These \ndiscounts will come from the cost savings from the efficiency improvement of the Project and financial profits of \ninvestment under the project. If the household\u2019s payment plus the discounts given by the PIAs is less than the total gas \nor heating bill, the remainder of the gas or heating bill will be covered by the \u201cheating assistance fund\u201d set up by city \ngovernments and managed by city finance bureaus. Similar approaches have been successfully implemented in some \nstates (e.g., Ohio, Pennsylvania) in the United States and other countries. This approach is consistent with ADB policy \nthat tariff subsidies should be transparent and explicit, and that the government social objectives should be separated \nfrom commercial management of enterprises. The discounts to the poor planned by the PIAs and preliminary cost \nsavings are summarized below: \n \n(i)  The PIA of the Fuxin CBM/CMM development plans to offer 50% discount for gas connection and 20% tariff \ndiscount for 15,000 poor households from 2004 to 2006. The estimated annual savings for the poor households \ninclude CNY12.75 million from the connection fee and CNY1.69 million from the tariff. \n(ii)  Under the Fushun gas distribution improvement, the PIA plans to provide 100% free gas connection and materials \ncosts for 2,500 poor households from 2004 to 2008 and 40% tariff discount for 1,500 poor miner households living in \nthe Aiyou Lujiadian and Qingmen Bishan mining districts from 2004 to 2008. It will result in annual savings of about \nCNY7.5 million from the connection fee  and materials costs and CNY1.5 million from the tariff for the poor \nhouseholds. \n(iii)  The PIA of the Benxi gas improvement plans to offer 50% discount for gas connection and 20% tariff discount for \n9,000 poor households from 2005 to 2009. The expected savings for the poor households are CNY7.65 million from \nthe connection fee and CNY1.01 million from the tariff. \n(iv) The PIA of the Benxi central heating supply plans to provide  free heating supply connection for 1,200 poor \nhouseholds between 2004 and 2005 and reduce 50% of the monthly user fees for 7,770 poor households between \n2004 and 2007 under the city poverty line. In total, it will result in savings of CNY1.8 million from connection fee and \nCNY7.12 million from the tariff per year for the poor households. \n(v)  The PIA of the Anshan central heating supply plans to provide free heating supply to 5,400 poor households. It \nwould result in a total annual saving of CNY7.452 million for the poor households between 2004 and 2008. The \ncompany will also waive 85% of heating cost for the retiree-headed 2,100 families of bankrupt enterprises from 2004 \nto 2008. It will result in a total saving of CNY2.463 million per year for these families. \n(vi) The PIA of the Liaoyang central heating supply plans to provide 50% discount for heating connection and 50% tariff \ndiscount for 9,200 poor households between 2004 and 2006. In total, it will  result in annual savings of \nCNY19.32 million from the connection fee and CNY6.07 million from the tariff reduction for the poor households. \n(vii) For the Yingkou central heating supply, the PIA plans to offer 50% discount for heating connection between 2004 \nand 2005 and 40% tariff reduction for 2,000 poor households between 2005 and 2007. The total annual savings for \nthe beneficiaries are estimated to be CNY2.85 million from connection fee and CNY1.06 million from tariff reduction. \n \nIn summary, a total of 90,870 poor households living under the city poverty lines classified for those with incomes under \nthe minimum living guarantee (MLG) in the project cities will benefit from the gas and central heating supply connection \nand tariff discounts offered by the PIAs, of which 38,900 poor households from gas and heating supply connection \n(including 26,500 poor households from gas and 12,400 poor households from heating) and 51,970 poor households \nfrom user fees (25,500 poor households from gas and 26,470 poor households from heating).1 The annual savings will \nbe CNY51.87 million for the connection fees and CNY28.38 million for tariff reductions for the beneficiaries. The project \ncity government-funded gas supply and central heating assistance program should supplement the tariff discounts \noffered by the PIAs so that the poor households can have sufficient gas and heating supply.  \n \n                                                 \n1   Of the total beneficiary households, 35,200 households are double-counted in the calculation, as they will benefit \nfrom both the discount of connection fee and tariff reduction. \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \nFor successful implementation of the above two specific gas and heating assistance programs for the poor and flow of \nthe benefits to the poor, the following mechanisms will be established by the city governments and the PIAs:  \n \n(i) Gas Connection and Tariff Discounts. First, those who are certified as poor households under the municipal MLG \nissued by the city civil affairs bureaus, will be identified by the gas bill collectors of the PIAs at the end of each year. \nThe PIAs will directly waive or deduct the gas connection discounts from the charges of gas connection fee and their \ntariff discounts from the monthly gas bills. The cost will be covered by the cost savings of efficiency improvements \n(about 25% to 50% transmission leakage reduction or about CNY250,000 for each subproject at average per year) and \nannual financial profits of the PIAs, and if necessary, the subsidies from the city government\u2019s special fund.  \n \n(ii) Heating Connection and Tariff Discounts. The PIAs will identify those who are certified as poor households \nunder the municipal MLG issued by the city civil affairs bureaus from June to October each year, and then submit the \nlist of poor households to street administration offices, district civil affairs offices, municipal civil affairs bureaus, \nmunicipal heating supply offices, and municipal finance bureaus for verification and approval. The poor households, \nonce identified by the PIAs and approved by the municipal finance bureaus, will be eligible for the connection and tariff \ndiscounts. The general principle under the specific heating assistance program is that the poor household\u2019s heating \nexpenditure will not exceed 5% of their total monthly expenditure.  \n \nThe will be implemented by the PIAs through waiving or deducting directly from the charges of heating connection fee \nand monthly heating bills. The PIAs portion will be the cost savings from efficiency improvements and financial gains of \nthe investment under the Project. The proportion financed by the established \u201cheating assistance fund\u201d of the city \ngovernments will come from annual municipal fiscal budget. The total annual amount of the heating assistance fund \nwill be determined by the number of the poor households submitted by the PIAs in October each year (before the \nheating season starts). The subsidy coverage of the city governments for the project subcomponents will depends on \nthe PIAs abilities to cover the discounts. The fund will be managed and disbursed by the city municipal finance bureaus \nto municipal heating supply office, and then to the PIAs. In turn, the PIAs will deduct the proportion financed by the \n\u201cheating assistance fund\u201d from the bill of the poor households.  \n \n7. Reemployment of affected workers. The heating supply subcomponent will result in closing of 412 existing small \nboilers in Benxi, Liaoyang, and Yingkou, affecting 1,874 workers. The PIAs have agreed to reemploy all the affected \nworkers in other similar units of their business or retrain them for reassignment. The PIAs have developed their \nrespective reemployment plan (Supplementary Appendix M) for the affected workers with a common goal that the \naffected workers would not be financially worse off than they would have been without the Project. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes    No  \n \nDuring project preparation, stakeholder analysis has been conducted, including the identification of stakeholders and \ntheir roles in the Project. The public consultation/participation has been the core element of the project design and will \ncontinue to be the core element during the project implementation and was prepared through community-driven design \nmechanisms involving  various stakeholders, including the project beneficiaries. A community participation and \nawareness program will be formulated and implemented by the PIAs to serve as an ongoing consultation mechanism for \nthe involvement of all stakeholders. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes                  No \n \nA resettlement information booklet for Fuxin CBM/CMM development subcomponent has been distributed to APs. The \nresettlement plan of the Project was distributed to the government of Liaoning province, PIAs, affected townships, \nvillages committees, and street committees and published on the ADB's resettlement web site in October 2004. Further \nconsultation with people affected by the Project will continue throughout the land acquisition process. Ongoing \nconsultations will also be carried out by the PIAs to understand and meet the evolving needs and expectations of the \nusers as well as increase the awareness of the public, especially the beneficiaries, about the benefits of the Project, and \nencourage the active involvement of local communities to maximize their support to the Project, promote gas and \nheating consumption and saving, and raise the social acceptance of user fees. The consultations can take the forms of \nannual questionnaire surveys by consumer category, combined with ad hoc community forums. Women\u2019s organizations \nand schools usually have extensive networks that can be used for the distribution of information materials and survey \nquestionnaires.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nTo maximize the project benefits to women, preferential policies will be given to women for the employment and training \nopportunities generated from the Project construction  and operation phases, and the proposed poverty reduction  \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  51 \n \nprograms of the Project. Women\u2019s needs and interests will be represented in project implementation. A proactive \nemployment quota system and targeted training programs for the women will be adopted by the PIAs. Over 40% of the \nemployment opportunities will be filled by women and the poor with the implementation of gender equity policies. \nParticular attention will be paid to women during the land acquisition and resettlement process. \n \nHas an output been prepared?     Yes     No \n \nE.  Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n  Significant/Not    Plan \nItem  Significant/None   Strategy to Address Issues  Required \n   Significant  The impacts of permanent land acquisition and temporary land   Full \n  occupation by the project construction are very limited.

Demand Forecast and Least-Cost Analysis \n \n1.  A demand forecast for each subcomponent was carried out by the Executing Agency, and \nthe project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultants reviewed the demand forecast \nand  concluded  that  the  risk  associated  with  demand  forecast  is  minimal  (Supplementary \nAppendix N). This is because the Project will provide supply to meet only a fraction of the total gas \nand heating demand in the project cities. Part A of the Project will supply methane gas for meeting \nthe existing cooking and water heating demand. The gas distribution component will provide gas \nto only a fraction of the total incremental demand in the project cities. The city central heating \nsupply component will replace the existing small inefficient boilers to meet the existing heating \ndemand. The risks associated with the demand forecast in the economic and financial viability \nanalyses are minimal. \n \n2.  A least-cost analysis was performed for the two categories of end use to be served by the \nProject, including: (i) household cooking and water heating and (ii) household space heating. The \nleast-cost analysis used constant 2003 prices and a discount rate of 12%. Tradable commodities \nwere  valued  at  border  prices  at  the  prevailing  exchange  rate  (CNY8.3/$1.0).  Nontradable \ncommodities were valued at shadow prices, using a mix of standard and specific conversion \nfactors.1 For household cooking and water heating, the analysis indicates that coal gas is the \nleast-cost option. For household space heating, the least-cost analysis concludes that the \ncombined heat and power generation option proposed for the Yinkou city central heating supply \nand the large centralized boilers proposed for other cities for central heating supplies are the \nleast-cost options. When coal bed methane/coal mine methane (CBM/CMM) are available, they \nare the least-cost options. \n \nB.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n3.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  for  each  project \nsubcomponent and for the whole Project. Consistent with the least-cost analysis, the economic \nanalysis applied conversion factors for investment costs for land,2 equipment costs, fuel costs, \nand operation and maintenance costs, where applicable. The input data and assumptions were \nreviewed by the PPTA consultants and found appropriate. For the EIRR calculations, the benefits of \noutput were mainly valued on the basis of cost saving of alternative fuels. The cost-saving benefits \nwere valued as the cost differences of the alternative energy supply options with and without the \nProject. A survey was carried out to determine the appropriate energy supply options for each \ncategory of consumers. The local environmental benefits were taken into account in the EIRR \ncalculations. Transmission and distribution losses were based on the statistics of historical line loss \nrates in each city. \n \n4.  The EIRR calculation takes into account only the main benefits of different components \nbut includes all project-related costs. The cost savings of alternative fuels are the main economic \nbenefits. This approach yields EIRRs ranging from 10.0% to 18.5% without and 16.8% to 43.8% \n                                                 \n1   A standard conversion factor of 0.93 was used. Border prices were used for all imported items. Local costs were \nshadow priced using group and specific conversion factors: 1.0 for equipment, 1.67 for steel, 0.76 for cement, \n0.82 for timber, 2.0 for skilled labor, and 0.67 for unskilled labor. Taxes and duties were excluded. \n2   Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization). \n ", "    Appendix 11  53 \n \nwith the local environmental benefits for the project subcomponents, and 13.6% without and \n26.3% with the local environmental benefits for  the whole Project. Sensitivity analyses were \nperformed for each subcomponent (details in Supplementary Appendix P). For the EIRR of the \nwhole Project in Table A11.2, sensitivity analysis showed the EIRR would decrease to (i) 20.7% if \nthe Project was to experience a cost overrun of 20%; (ii) 19.6% if the benefits were reduced by \n20%; (iii) 22.7% if the Project was to experience a commissioning delay of 1 year; and (iv) 12.3% \nif (i), (ii), and (iii) all happened. \n \nTable A11.1: Summary of Economic Internal Rates of Return (%) \n \nSubcomponent  Without     With Local \nEnvironmental Benefits  Environmental Benefits \n       \nFuxin CBM/CMM Development  18.5    18.5 \nFushun Gas Distribution Improvement  10.0    16.8 \nBenxi Gas Distribution Improvement  12.4    17.3 \nAnshan Central Heating Supply  13.6    28.9 \nBenxi Central Heating Supply  10.8    25.2 \nLiaoyang Central Heating Supply  13.9    43.8 \nYingkou Central Heating Supply  10.4    18.1 \nWhole Project  13.6    26.3 \n       \nCBM = coal bed methane, CMM = coal mine methane, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.

This appendix describes the notes and assumptions used in the financial \nevaluation. All the costs and prices are expressed in constant 2003 prices. The economic lives of \nthe subprojects are estimated at 20 years with no residual value. The financial operations of the \nindividual project implementation agencies (PIAs) for the Liaoning Environmental Improvement \nProject (the Project) were projected based on the assumptions described in Appendix 7. The \nprojected financial statements are shown in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n2.  Benefits and Costs. The benefits from the Project will be derived from the sales of output \nfrom the individual subprojects based on the projected production levels and applicable tariffs. \nThe capital costs include physical contingencies but exclude price contingencies and financial \ncharges during development. The agreed transfer prices or projected purchase costs of inputs \nwere considered. Other operating costs include personnel, distribution, administration, and other \nexpenses. \n \n3.  Financial Internal Rate of Return. The financial viability of the Project was subjected to \nsensitivity analysis under various adverse conditions. The sensitivity analysis results for the \noverall project are shown in Table A12.1.

Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The weighted average cost of capital was calculated \nafter tax, in real terms, following the methodology in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by \nthe Asian Development Bank using actual capital mix and costs of funds. Actual interest rates of \nlocal loan funds were considered. For the ADB loan, the interest rate is based on the current \nLondon interbank offered rate on 5-year fixed-interest swap (currently at 3.9%) plus the ADB loan \nspread of 0.6%. The cost of equity was assumed to be 8.0%, based on the current yield on the \nlong-term government bond, plus an assumed risk premium of 3.0%.

Methodology \n \n1.  The poverty impacts of the Project are assessed by evaluating the expected distribution of \nnet economic benefits among different groups. The approach takes only the direct project benefits \ninto account in assessing poverty impact. The direct project benefits include: (i) lower gas and \nheating tariffs due to more efficient supply and (ii) environmental benefits. The methodology \ninvolves three steps. The first step is to estimate the present value of net financial and economic \nbenefits by participating group. Next, group-wise, the financial benefits are deducted from the \neconomic benefits to give the distribution of net economic benefits. Finally, the net economic \nbenefits (NEB) accrue to the poor according to the proportion of each group that is poor. A poverty \nimpact ratio expressing the proportion of NEB accruing to the poor can be calculated by \ncomparing NEB to the poor with NEB of the Project as a whole.1 The analysis used constant 2003 \nprices, a standard conversion factor of 0.93, and a discount rate of 12%. Tradable commodities \nwere valued at border prices at the prevailing exchange rate. Nontradable commodities were \nvalued at shadow prices, using a mix of standard and specific conversion factors. Net financial \nbenefits (NFB) and NEB are expressed in yuan (CNY). \n \nB.  Benefit Distribution \n \n2.  The  NFB  are  equal  to  sales  revenue  of  CNY2,671 million  minus  capital  costs  of \nCNY740 million, operating costs of CNY1,744 million, labor costs of CNY246 million, and income \ntaxes of CNY121 million. The NFB of the Project shows a loss of CNY181 million in net present \nvalue at 12% discount rate (Table A13.1). The NEB of the Project expressed at the domestic price \nlevel are CNY1,012 million. They are  equal to gross benefits of CNY3,887 million (including \nconsumer surplus and environmental benefits) minus capital costs of CNY800 million, operating \ncosts of CNY1,866 million, and labor costs of CNY208 million (wages valued at the shadow price \nof labor for both skilled and unskilled labor). \n \n3.  The difference between the NEB and the NFB is distributed by groups. The difference of \nCNY1,193 million is made up of (i) consumer surplus of CNY307 million (mainly in terms of the \ndifference between the without-project cost of gas and heating supply and the with-project \nexpenditure on gas and heating plus the value of gas and heating supply consumed but not paid \nfor; (ii) the environmental benefits of CNY909 million from efficiency improvement, and closure of \nsmall, coal-fired boilers; (iii) the difference between financial and economic cost of capital \ninvestment and operating costs of CNY60 million and CNY122 million, respectively (mainly due to \ngovernment taxes and duties, overvaluation of the exchange rate, and other price distortions); \n(iii) loss to skilled labor of CNY31 million (current wages less opportunity cost of labor); (iv) gain of \nunskilled labor of CNY68 million; and (v) income taxes of CNY121 million.  \n \n4.  The differences between the NEB and the NFB give rise to losses and gains among the \nproject participants. Considering the overall result of a NFB of negative CNY181 million and a \nNEB of CNY1,012 million for the Project, the NEB exceeds the NFB by CNY1,193 million. Skilled \nlabor will lose by CNY31 million and the gain of unskilled labor by CNY68 million at the project \nwage levels that are lower (higher) than the opportunity costs, while the consumers will gain from \ntheir consumer surplus of CNY307 million. The investor (project companies) of the Project will \nloss CNY181 million at a discount rate of 12%. Since project companies are state-owned \nenterprises, the CNY181 million losses could be considered as the Government's financial loss \n                                                 \n1  The poverty impact ratio is based on the distribution of project net benefits. This differs from ADB\u2019s project \nclassification criterion that is expressed in terms of the number of beneficiaries. \n ", "  Appendix 13  59 \n \nfrom investing in the Project (unable to invest in a project with 12% financial return). The \nenvironmental benefits of CNY909 million and income taxes of CNY121 million will be considered \nas  the  gains  to  the  Government  from  a  national  perspective.  Subtracting  the  losses  of \nCNY60 million from capital costs and CNY122 million from operating costs results in a net \neconomic gain to the Government of CNY848 million. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Ratio \n \n5.  The differences between the financial and economic values, and the consequent gains \nand losses for different project participants, provide the basis for considering the impact of the \nProject for the poor. The poor account for 7.4% of the people living in the project area.2 The \nincremental  gas  and  better  heating  supply  could  benefit  the  urban  poor  more  as  their \nconsumption are projected to increase faster because of their current low consumption levels. \nThe government of Liaoning province agreed to ensure that project cities consider establishing \nheating assistance programs for the poor with adequate annual government budget. Cost savings \nresulting from the efficiency improvement of the Project will be passed on the poor in the forms of \nheating bill discounts. These programs will be designed to alleviate the affordability problems in \nthe project cities. Based on the projected share of urban consumers, their electricity consumption \npattern, number of the poor living below the poverty line, the projected cost savings and the \nestimated tariff reduction, the share of the consumer surplus going to the poor is estimated at \n7.0%. \n \n6.  From a national perspective, the gains of CNY848 million (the gains of the Government) \nare mainly the environmental benefits and income taxes with the Project. There are some \ngovernment  losses  from  capital  investment  and  operating  costs  (CNY60 million  and \nCNY122 million, respectively). The gain is further offset by the financial losses of CNY181 million \n(at 12% discount rate). A 2001 Asian Development Bank (ADB) publication indicates that the poor \nare  disproportionately  affected  by  environmental  degradation.3 The  poor  do  not  have  the \ninformation about and access to, or cannot afford more efficient (less-polluting) equipment and \nfuels. The gas distribution and heating supply networks are usually less well functioning or absent \nin the poorer sections of cities. The inadequate gas distribution and heating networks increase the \nexposure of the poor to daily doses of pollutants as well as the risk of accidents. Indoor air \npollution puts, in particular, women and children at risk. Based on the discussions with the \nExecuting Agency (EA), the local environmental protection agency, and the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultants,  this  analysis  estimates  that  the  share  of  the \nGovernment net benefits (environmental benefits) going to the poor below the poverty line will be \n17%. \n \n7.  The direct employment effect of the Project during construction is an important benefit \nfrom the Project. The local currency portion of the Project is about 54% of the project cost. Out of \nthe 54%, the non-equipment portion is substantial. Part of that will benefit the rural poor in the \nproject area by direct employment.4 Since the poor are normally unskilled labors, they will be the \nbeneficiaries of the Project as the current wages would be higher than their opportunity costs. \nBased on the projected labor employed in the Project through a special employment program for \nthe poor, particularly in gas distribution and central heating supply subcomponents, 15% of the \nsurplus for unskilled labor will go to the urban poor. \n                                                 \n2   The poverty lines used in the poverty analysis are the official urban poverty lines in the project areas. \n3   ADB. 2001. Moving the Poverty Reduction Agenda Forward in Asia and the Pacific.  Manila. \n4   Project construction will create a significant amount of unskilled and semiskilled employment opportunities, most of \nwhich can be filled by the poor under the report of the PPTA consultants: Social-Economic Survey of Liaoning \nEnvironmental Improvement Project. \n ", "60  Appendix 13 \n \n8.  Table A13 shows that the NEB directly accruing to the poor are CNY141 million. The \nProject\u2019s poverty impact ratio, which expresses the proportion of net economic benefits of the \nProject accruing to the poor, is 13.9%. Since the ratio is higher than the ratio of the poverty \npopulation in the project area estimated at  7.4%, the analysis concludes  that the Project is \npro-poor. The calculation poverty impact ratio is based on the direct benefits of the Project. All \nother indirect benefits are not captured in the poverty impact ratio. \n \nD.  Conclusion \n \n9.  The analysis concludes that the Project will support pro-poor economic growth. The risk \nanalysis on the poverty impact ratio calculation, together with the analysis on the probability of \noverall project failure, concludes that the probability of a negative outcome for the poor is minimal. \n \nTable A13: Benefit Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n(present values at 12%, in CNY million) \n \n    Accounts    Beneficiaries \n  Item  Financial  Economic        Government   \n    Accounts  Accounts  Difference    Consumers  Economy  Labor  Total \n                   \nA.
