Investment Program Summary\nThe investment program will promote sustainable development of cross-border areas and mutually beneficial regional\ncooperation and integration between Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and\nMongolia. The program will improve economic inclusion, ecosystems, and crucial services in the five IMAR border crossing point\n(BCP) communities and surrounding areas on both sides of the 3,200 kilometer (km) PRC-Mongolia, which lags in economic\nand social development. The program will enhance infrastructure at key BCPs, related services including health services, and\nliving conditions by improving environment and waste management systems. Expanded financial and business support to small\nand medium-sized enterprises in border regions will spur local income growth. Establishment of an agricultural value chain will\nenhance livelihoods on both sides of the frontier. The program will have strong regional spillover benefits to Mongolia:\nimprovement in infrastructure and services at IMAR-Mongolia BCPs will boost the volume and quality of trade, creating about\n3,300 direct and indirect jobs in Mongolia; and improvement in health and other services will benefit disadvantaged communities\non both sides of the border.\nImpact: Sustainable economic development and shared prosperity for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC)\nregion achieved.\nOutcome: Sustainable economic opportunities and living conditions in areas along the IMAR-Mongolia border improved.\nOutputs: (i) Sustainable infrastructure for cross-border connectivity and health services improved, (ii) Ecological environment in\nkey border towns improved, (iii) Income  generating opportunities expanded,  and (iv) Cross-border cooperation mechanisms,\ntechnical project management, and institutional capacity strengthened\nImplementation Arrangements: Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will be the executing agency.\nProject Readiness: Project readiness is high. The executing agency and implementing agencies have conducted detailed \nfeasibility studies and prepared all required reports for the subprojects under the first tranche. \n9.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Inner \nMongolia Sustainable Cross-Border Development Investment Program. \n \n2.  The investment program will promote sustainable development of cross-border areas and \nmutually beneficial regional cooperation and integration between the PRC\u2019s Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous  Region  (IMAR)  and  Mongolia.  The  program  will  improve  economic  inclusion, \necosystems, and basic social services in the five IMAR border crossing point (BCP) communities \nand surrounding areas on both sides of the 3,200-kilometer (km) PRC\u2013Mongolia frontier, which \nlags in economic and social development. Expanded financial and business support to small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in border regions will spur local income growth. Establishment \nof an agricultural value chain will enhance livelihoods on both sides of the frontier. The program \nwill have strong regional spillover benefits to Mongolia: improvement in infrastructure and services \nat IMAR\u2013Mongolia BCPs will boost the volume and quality of trade, creating about 3,300 direct \nand  indirect  jobs  in  Mongolia;  and  improvement  in  health  and  other  services  will  benefit \ndisadvantaged communities on both sides of the border.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE \n \nA.  Development Constraints \n \n3.  The BCP communities are located along one of the world\u2019s longest international borders. \nThey are far from urban centers and industrial hubs and located in an often hostile environment \nof steppe and desert.1 Although they serve as the main cross-border logistics conduits for the \nrapidly expanding trade between the PRC and Mongolia, socioeconomic development has largely \npassed them by. Their fragile economies are narrow, and basic infrastructure and basic services \nare lacking. More jobs and rural development are needed to reduce inequality and income \npoverty.  Better  medical  services  are  urgently  required,  as  are  effective  responses  to \ndesertification and many other ecological problems in the frontier region.  \n \n4.  Interlinked  obstacles  to  borderland  development.  The  key  obstacles  to  greater \nsocioeconomic development in the borderlands include the poor infrastructure and inefficient \nprocesses at the IMAR BCPs. This stifles the potential for development on both sides of the border \nand has curtailed progress under a 2011 strategic partnership between the PRC and Mongolia \non greater cross-border tourism, exchanges in health and education services, and cooperation in \ntransboundary environmental protection and food security.2 It is also a barrier to achieving the \ntwo countries\u2019 shared goal of developing border port towns and areas into important venues for \nlocal trade, cultural exchange, and the movement of people.3 Resolving issues at the IMAR BCPs \nis also vitally important to the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) region \noverall, since they are crucial logistics facilities\u2014and current bottlenecks\u2014on CAREC corridor 4.4 \n \n \n1  Four of the five BCP communities covered by the program fit this description\u2014Uliji, Ganqi-Maodu, Erenhot, and \nMandula. The exception is Arxan. \n2  Joint communique issued by the PRC and Mongolia on 17 June 2011. \n3  Government of IMAR. Outline for Developing Medium- and Long-Term Strategic Partnership Relationship between \nPRC and Mongolia. Signed in 2014. Unpublished. \n4  The six CAREC corridors link the region\u2019s key economic hubs and connect the landlocked CAREC countries to other \nEurasian and global markets. Corridor 4 connects the Russian Federation with East Asia, including the IMAR and \nMongolia.  \n ", "2 \n5.  Inadequate border crossing point infrastructure and systems. Physical infrastructure \nand cross-border land connectivity are inadequate at the IMAR BCPs. Storage and quarantine \nfacilities are lacking. The outdated and inefficient management systems, customs procedures, \nand standards compound the adverse impacts of the infrastructure issues. A one-stop customs \nprocess has not been established, and goods clearance is not yet automated or integrated with \nsanitary and phytosanitary measures. Mongolia is particularly affected. Making lengthy IMAR BCP \nclearance times 2 hours shorter would save Mongolia an estimated $65 per export shipment.5 \nBetter animal disease prevention and control at the BCPs would reduce transboundary disease \ntransmission.6 Greater efficiency at the IMAR BCPs could further accelerate the growth of trade \nbetween the countries. It expanded from $4 billion in 2010 to $8 billion in 2018, and about $5 \nbillion of this total was between Mongolia and the IMAR alone. Trade by the PRC and Mongolia \nwith third party countries, including those in Europe, would also grow. Better BCP processing on \nthe PRC side of the frontier would improve landlocked Mongolia\u2019s access to the PRC\u2019s markets \nand to the Republic of Korea, Japan and beyond through the PRC\u2019s Tianjin seaport. \n \n6.  Poor health and other basic services in the border areas. Public health across broad \nareas of both countries is negatively impacted by a shortage of medical facilities and health care \nin the IMAR BCP city of Erenhot. Erenhot\u2019s comprehensive secondary-level international hospital, \nwhich serves residents of a transborder region reaching 250 km into Mongolia, is overtaxed and \nunderequipped.7 Diagnostic capacity is limited, and the hospital is unable to treat many serious \nailments or properly respond to cross-border health risks from infectious diseases such as \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection. Delays in care often force patients to spend on high-\ncost travel to obtain treatment in Beijing or Ulaanbaatar more than 600 km away. Long waits for \nproper emergency care often result in permanent disability or death. Deficiencies in sanitation \nand other basic services tend to exacerbate the overall elevated health risks and subpar state of \nhealth of the people living in the border areas. \n \n7.  Unfavorable environment and unsustainable living conditions. The combination of a \nharsh environment and poor basic services make most borderland areas inhospitable. Heavy \nsnowstorms are frequent during the bitterly cold winters. Extremely hot, dry, and often windy \nsummers exacerbate the damage caused by desertification. Sandstorms regularly wreak havoc \non agriculture, animal husbandry, grasslands, infrastructure, and BCP operations. About 50,000 \ncubic meters of sand, or more than 2,000 truckloads, must be cleared from the roads each year \nin Erenhot alone. The poor climate interferes with outdoor activity, drives residents indoors, adds \nto an already heavy household cleaning and washing burden for women, and leads to heightened \nincidence and severity of respiratory and eye disease. An absence of proper sanitation services, \nparticularly in Erenhot, makes the situation worse, as pollution from uncollected waste blends with \nsand particles in the air. Residents of Erenhot appear ready to pay much more for better sanitation \nservices, but the city lacks waste transfer equipment.8 Groundwater in borderlands is scarce and \nmust be used sparingly. More clean energy use is needed to avoid worsening of air pollution. \n \n8.  Limited income-generating opportunities. BCP areas are too remote to attract the \noutside investment needed to create sustainable local employment and income opportunities. \n \n5  ADB. 2018. Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridor Performance Measurement and Monitoring\u2014\nAnnual Report. Manila. \n6 IMAR has 10 ports open to Mongolia. Based on the urgency of the investment required and subprojects readiness, \nthe program will involve five of those: Arxan, Erenhot, Ganqi-Maodu, Mandula, and Uliji. \n7 The PRC\u2013Mongolia International Hospital is the only modern comprehensive secondary-level hospital in Erenhot \nmunicipality. Only 131 of its 188 beds can be used due to a lack of medical equipment and limited capacity of staff. \nIn addition to pediatrics, obstetrics, and special diagnostic services, it provides emergency response with first aid. \nThe hospital treated 108,339 patients in 2018, including 2,150 from Mongolia. \n8 Household survey in July 2019 conducted by ADB during investment program preparation. \n ", "3 \nSMEs play an important role in cross-border trade and job creation but have little access to bank \ncredit, reliable market information, or business development advice. Businesses led by women \nare particularly underserved. Important opportunities to bridge the inequalities between urban \ncenters and rural regions in the IMAR remain unrealized. These issues leave agricultural incomes \nlow and poverty levels high. Low productivity, poor product quality, and restricted market access \nare particularly hard on the 501,000 predominantly small-scale livestock farming households that \nproduce 42.7% of IMAR\u2019s agricultural output and employ about 993,000 people. The same issues \nafflict sheep herding in the adjacent Mongolian borderlands. Farmers on both sides of the frontier \nneed to be integrated into a well-developed sheep value chain in the agribusiness sector. \n \n9.  Weak development institutions and capacities in border areas. Coordination between \nIMAR  and  Mongolia  is  crucial  to  developing  sustainable  BCPs  and  border  areas,  but  the \nmechanisms  for  doing  so  are  weak.  The  governments  of  IMAR  and  Mongolia  are  key  to \ncollaboration between the two sides, but have little knowledge of or experience with international \nbest  practices  for  joint  BCP  area  development,  including  approaches  for  dealing  with \ntransboundary health risks and drug, human, and wildlife trafficking. \n \nB.  Rationale for the Program \n \n10.  Pandemic impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruptions to \nthe global economy and slowed down the economies of both the PRC and Mongolia, while \nreducing trade and the movement of people between the two countries. The PRC\u2019s gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth is expected to fall from 6.1% in 2019 to 1.8% in 2020, while \nMongolia\u2019s GDP growth is expected to fall from 5.1% in 2019 to \u20131.9% in 2020.9 Although the \ninvestment program was prepared before the pandemic, the government recognizes that the \nprogram remains highly relevant and will be a key driver for post-pandemic economic recovery \nand revitalization, as it will increase job opportunities, expand trade, improve the livability of border \ntowns, and support SMEs. In addition, the program will strengthen the system of screening and \nresponding to human and animal transboundary health risks. Adopting new technologies to \nmonitor and trace agricultural products and enhancing the exchange of customs, immigration, \nand inspections data between the PRC and Mongolia will enable the two countries to better \nmanage these risks and ensure safer cross-border movement of goods and people. \n \n11.  Regional cooperation road map. The investment program will help to deliver sustainable \nand inclusive socioeconomic progress in communities and rural areas on both sides of the PRC\u2013\nMongolia  border.  The  program  design  reflects  the  common  objectives  and  road  maps  for \ncooperation of the PRC, the IMAR, and Mongolia. Greater cooperation with Mongolia is a priority \nunder the 2016\u20132020 5-year economic and social development plan of the Government of IMAR \n(IMARG).10 The Government of Mongolia has agreed with the IMARG and the Russian Federation \non a long-term cooperation strategy and an $18 billion investment plan up to 2035.11 The IMARG \nand Mongolia have also agreed on a medium- and long-term framework for cooperation during \n2015\u20132025.12 The framework sets directions for eliminating physical and nonphysical restraints \non progress toward inclusive and sustainable cross-border development and growth. \n \n \n9   ADB. 2020.

The  investment  program  will  support  the  2015\u20132025  IMARG\u2013\nMongolia framework\u2019s priorities. These include (i) enhancing connectivity through better transport \nand  energy  infrastructure;  (ii)  strengthening  the  key  BCPs  and  the  economic  and  social \ndevelopment of border areas; (iii) accelerating the development of economic corridors; (iv) piloting \neconomic cooperation zones (ECZs); and (v) tackling such cross-border risks as those related to \npublic health and environmental fragility. The program is aligned with the framework goals, \nparticularly those of making BCPs and border areas effective bases for cooperation; improving \nservices; and strengthening the two countries\u2019 ability to jointly address cross-border disease \ncontrol, improve environment protection, and deal with other transboundary challenges. \n \n13.  Policy framework. The IMARG has established a lead group under its current 5-year plan \n(footnote 10) to plan, coordinate, and strengthen collaboration with Mongolia and other CAREC \ncountries.  Policies  have  been  set  and  reforms  designed  to  make  IMAR\u2013Mongolia  border \ncrossings more efficient, enhance the business environment at BCP ports, and improve the \nlivability of the border towns.13 Among the policy aims are a reduction in the number of permits \nand the documentation needed to process exports and imports and the institution of online border \ncrossing applications and approvals. Customs is to be integrated with sanitary and phytosanitary \nmeasures, and joint customs inspection with Mongolia will be upgraded  through electronic \ntransmission of export and import goods lists. One-stop customs processes are to be used to \nensure that businesses receive timely inspection results, and public\u2013private partnerships are to \nbe piloted by 2026 in an effort to improve border services. In addition, the policies call for the \nIMARG  to  enhance  its  poverty  reduction  program  by  partnering  with  agricultural  leading \nenterprises and to strengthen border region hospitals to provide better medical services. Plans to \ncreate a shared cross-border ECZ centered on the region\u2019s busiest BCP, which links Erenhot in \nIMAR with the Zamyn-Uud ECZ in Mongolia, are to be accelerated.14 \n \n14.  Strategic context. The investment program aligns with Strategy 2030 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), which identifies regional cooperation and integration as one of ADB\u2019s \nseven operational priority areas.15 It is designed to support the Strategy 2030 operational priorities \nto (i) address remaining poverty and reduce inequalities (through the delivery of output 3); (ii) \naccelerate progress in gender equality (all outputs); (iii) tackle climate change, build climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhance environmental sustainability (output 2); and (iv) promote rural \ndevelopment and food security (output 3). The investment program is also well aligned with \nStrategy 2030\u2019s approach to support upper middle-income countries by promoting innovation, \ninternational best practices, and knowledge sharing for PRC and IMAR. The program aligns with \nthe priorities under ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC for 2016\u20132020 of managing \nclimate  change  and  the  environment,  promoting  regional  cooperation  and  integration,  and \nsupporting inclusive economic growth.16 \n \n15.

The IMAR \ninvestment program will be implemented in close coordination with two complementary ongoing \nADB operations in Mongolia\u2014the Developing the Economic Cooperation Zone Project, which is \nproviding targeted support to the Mongolia side of the Erenhot\u2013Zamyn-Uud BCP;19 and the 2016 \nRegional Improvement of Border Services Project, which is improving Mongolia\u2019s border services \nat two other BCPs on its frontier with the IMAR.20 Similar past operations also show that a cross-\nsectoral program approach involving mutually supportive technical, environmental, financial, and \neconomic  elements  along  with  stakeholder  ownership  and  coordination  will  be  critical  to \nsuccessfully lifting living standards and living conditions for people in the BCP areas on both sides \nof the frontier in a sustainable long-term way. \n \nIII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \n16.  Value added by ADB assistance. The program will go beyond the removal of critical \nlogistical obstacles to greater trade between the PRC, Mongolia, and the other CAREC countries. \nIn addition to upgrading and modernizing the facilities and systems at five IMAR BCPs, it is \ndesigned holistically to ensure that the BCP communities and the two countries\u2019 border regions \nlong bypassed by the socioeconomic spin-offs of growing bilateral and regional trade also share \nin the benefits. The program will enhance the livability and sustainability of target border regions \nby supporting the use of such advanced technologies as smart drip irrigation with reclaimed water \nfor forestation, smart port management based on information and communication technology, and \nsmart waste collection and transfer. International best practices in gender equity will be applied \nthrough targeted support for women-led SMEs, the gender-sensitive design of BCP facilities, and \npoverty alleviation program (PAP) support for low-income households headed by women. The \nprogram will promote regional public goods through cross-border spillover effects (para. 17) and \nmeasures to address the climate change and adaptation challenges that confront both the IMAR \nand Mongolia. These will include support for carbon pollution reduction by building protective \nforest strips and the use of renewable and clean energy for heating supply. The program\u2019s sound \ntechnical design, improvements to the environment and ecosystems, and robust economic and \nfinancial returns will ensure its long-term sustainability and benefits.  \n \n17.  Benefits for Mongolia. The investment program aims to provide strong benefits for \nMongolia. Half of the jobs created are expected to go to residents of the Mongolia border regions, \nespecially in agriculture, port management, food processing, and retail and wholesale trade. More \nefficient animal inspection, value-chain development, and high-tech tracing and branding in sheep \nbreeding should increase demand and prices in the PRC for Mongolia\u2019s sheep and raise the \nexports for the country\u2019s herders from the current level of 300,000 head a year. The upgrading of \nefficiency of the IMAR BCP at Erenhot will spur Mongolian exports and is projected to generate \n2,000 additional jobs in Mongolia by 2030. Direct spill-over benefit measured in gross terms is \nestimated at about $855 million. Mongolia will benefit alongside the PRC from the coordinated \nsteps to be taken under the program to control the cross-border spread of communicable human \n \nRepublic of China for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Environmental Improvement Project (Phase II).

The program\u2019s coordination with ADB\u2019s ongoing \noperations to develop the ECZ on the Mongolia side of the Erenhot\u2013Zamyn-Uud BCP and \nupgrade services of two Mongolian BCPs on its border with the IMAR will maximize bilateral \nsharing in the program benefits (para. 15 and footnote 19).  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The investment program is aligned with the following impact: sustainable economic \ndevelopment and shared prosperity for CAREC region achieved.21 The investment program will \nhave the following outcome: sustainable economic opportunities and living conditions in areas \nalong the IMAR\u2013Mongolia border improved.22  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n19.  Output  1:  Sustainable  infrastructure  for  cross-border  connectivity  and  health \nservices  improved.  The  investment  program  will  support  sustainable  infrastructure  and \ninstitutional changes at five key BCPs stretched over 2,000 km along the border between IMAR \nand  Mongolia.  This  output  comprises:  (i)  establishing  a  smart  port  management  systems, \nincluding one-stop inspection and intelligent vehicle queuing; (ii) installing a wind-powered, clean \nenergy heating supply for the Erenhot\u2013Zamyn-Uud ECZ; (iii) building connecting and access \nroads at ECZs and BCPs; (iv) improving a transit system to smoothen and speed up BCP logistics \nand reduce transboundary health risks including storage and transshipment facilities, customs \nclearance  systems,  and  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  clearance  facilities;  and  (v)  enhancing \ncapacity and quality of services at the PRC\u2013Mongolia International Hospital in Erenhot through \nthe provision of advanced medical equipment and training on regional health security issues. In \ndesigning the infrastructure, the Group of 20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment will \nbe followed, including the principles of sustainability, resilience, inclusiveness, and innovative \ntechnologies.23 \n \n20.  Output  2:  Ecological  environment  in  key  border  towns  improved.  This  output \nincludes: (i) creating protective forest strips to safeguard BCP communities from sandstorms and \nimproving environmental conditions using smart forestation technologies such as advanced \nreclaimed-water irrigation and intelligent fertilization, and (ii) piloting a smart municipal waste \ncollection system and introducing recycling systems to reduce negative impacts from human \nactivities on the environment. \n \n21.  Output  3: Income-generating  opportunities expanded.  This  output  comprises: (i) \nproviding local currency loans to SMEs engaged in cross-border businesses through a financial \nintermediation loan (FIL); (ii) strengthening IMAR\u2019s business development service system for \nSMEs with particular support through piloting a program for female entrepreneurs and SMEs led \nby women; (iii) developing an inclusive sheep value chain to create economic opportunities for \nfarmers in border areas by building (a) animal quarantine facilities, (b) sheep processing logistics \npark, (c) stud sheep breeding and farming bases at the Mandula port, and (d) a livestock tracing \nand management system; and (iv) establishing the PAP to ensure that poor households, including \nthose headed by women, are integrated into the value chain. \n \n \n21 ADB. 2017.

G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment. \n ", "7 \n22.  Output 4: Cross-border cooperation mechanisms, technical project management, \nand  institutional  capacity  strengthened.  This  output  includes:  (i)  annual  international \nworkshops to support existing bilateral coordination mechanisms at the Erenhot\u2013Zamyn-Uud \nBCP and to facilitate cross-border policy dialogue between the PRC and Mongolia; (ii) training for \nagricultural enterprises, farming households, and rural cooperatives to improve their use of \nlivestock farming technology, animal disease prevention, and livestock waste management; and \n(iii) training for executing agency, implementing agencies, project implementing entities (PIEs), \nand counterpart Mongolian officials in safeguards, procurement, financial management, gender \nequality, and awareness of sexual exploitation and harassment.  \n \n23.  Use of the Multitranche Financing Modality. The investment program\u2019s outputs are best \nfinanced by an MFF to sustainably achieve the outcome.24 The program aims to address multiple \ncomplex and interacting development constraints in a vast, underdeveloped, and environmentally \nchallenged region straddling the border of two countries. This requires a phased, integrated, and \nsustained response. The three MFF tranches are sequenced according to subprojects  readiness, \ntheir urgency, geographical locations, results of ongoing coordination between the two countries, \nand expected progress in similar ADB operations in Mongolia (para. 15). The road maps and \npolicy frameworks of the PRC and IMAR will guide these long-term investments. \n \n24.  Modality advantages. The MFF ensures ADB\u2019s predictable long-term financing for these \napproaches  and  will  help  ADB  achieve  the  program\u2019s  intended  outcome  (para.  18).  The \ninvestment program will cement ADB\u2019s role as an honest broker between IMAR and Mongolia in \nexpanding partnerships for sustainable development and creating institutional mechanisms to \nsupport the development of BCPs and border areas up to 2031 and beyond. The program will \nsupport sustained, ongoing capacity strengthening of executing and implementing agencies and \nthe IMARG overall, rather than building capacity piecemeal through stand-alone projects. Lessons \nfrom tranche 1 will be applied to tranches 2 and 3. The MFF allows for phasing of important \ncomponents. For example, forestation can be gradually expanded with each tranche to avail of \ngrowing wastewater treatment capacity, thereby minimizing the use of precious groundwater.  \n \n25.  Eligibility of financial intermediary. ADB and the IMARG have selected the Bank of \nInner Mongolia as financial intermediary for onlending ADB\u2019s FIL proceeds to qualified SMEs \nunder tranche 1. Other financial institutions selected by the Borrower and acceptable to ADB may \nparticipate in the FIL onlending. To be eligible, these  banks must have sufficient financial \ncreditworthiness, the institutional capacity to manage SME financing schemes, sufficient reach in \nthe targeted SME markets, and the ability to meet ADB\u2019s reporting and safeguard standards.25 \nSelected banks will provide matching counterpart funds under tranche 1.26 \n \n26.  Scope of tranche 1. Tranche 1 will help finance the delivery of all four program outputs. \nA smart port management system in the Erenhot\u2013Zamyn-Uud ECZ, and a service area and \ncustoms supervision center at the Mandula port (IMAR) will be built, and the equipment at the \ninternational hospital in Erenhot will be upgraded (output 1). Ecological restoration will be carried \nout in the ECZ, and a smart waste collection system established in Erenhot (output 2). SME \n \n24 Comparison of Financing Modality (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Detailed eligibility criteria are in Appendix 3 of the Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). The Bank of Mongolia was cleared by ADB\u2019s financial and integrity due diligence. The \nfinancial intermediation role for the program can be extended to other banks and financial institutions by applying the \nsame criteria and requirements during the program and tranche design and implementation. Financial due diligence \nand performance review will be conducted on selected financial intermediaries for renewals at the end of loan terms. \n26 The eligibility criteria for SME subborrowers have been developed and are in the Facility Administration Manual \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nfinancing  support,  the  construction  of  a  quarantine  station  at  the  Mandula  port,  and  the \nestablishment of a product tracing and management system and PAP will contribute to expanding \nincome-generating opportunities (output 3). Output 4 activities under tranche 1 will include the \ncapacity improvements and facilitation of policy dialogue between IMAR and Mongolia Feasibility \nstudies for all subprojects have been undertaken, and the domestic approval process completed. \nTranche 1 is representative of the types of investments to be supported under the whole MFF.  \n \n27.  Subsequent tranches. Some program interventions will be completed in full  under \ntranche 1, including the upgrading of the international hospital in Erenhot, implementation of the \nPAP, and creation of the inclusive sheep-breeding value chain. Other activities will continue under \ntranches 2 and 3 to ensure full delivery of the outputs through the program\u2019s phased approach. \nTranche 1 lessons will be applied to tranches 2 and 3; and output 1 activities to upgrade the \nErenhot and Mandula BCPs will be extended to the ports at Uliji, Ganqi-Maodu, and Arxan. \nEcological improvements (output 2) will begin under tranche 1 and expanded in tranche 2. \nTranche 3 will include a second phase of environment improvement including smart forestation in \nErenhot. The financial intermediation loans for SMEs will continue under tranche 2, and SMEs \nwill receive business development support under tranche 3.27 Prefeasibility studies of indicative \ntranche 2 and 3 subprojects are complete, and the subprojects\u2019 readiness level is high.  \n \nC.

An overall FIRR of 5.47% was determined for the four revenue-\ngenerating outputs which met the ADB requirement that is higher than the weighted average cost \nof capital (1.27)32 and the financial net present value was CNY825 million. \n \n35.  Financial  sustainability.  For  tranche  1,  ADB  undertook  sustainability  analysis  to \ndetermine the capacity of the PAP, its implementing entity (Xiaoweiyang), and the non-revenue-\ngenerating subprojects to meet incremental program fund requirements over time (including \noperation  and  maintenance  costs  and  debt  repayments).  Xiaoweiyang  was  found  to  have \nsufficient projected cash flows to finance the required counterpart funding. Financial sustainability \nrequires Xiaoweiyang to keep its current ratio above 2.0 and its debt\u2013equity ratio at not more than \n45:55. It should also achieve a debt service coverage ratio of 1.3 by 2025 (a covenant to that \neffect has been included in the legal agreement). Fiscal projections showed that the Erenhot \nMunicipal Government and the Damaoqi County Government can meet the funding requirements \nof the nonrevenue subprojects with negligible impacts on their annual budgets. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n36.  Financial management. A standard financial management assessment carried out by \nADB for tranche 1 confirmed that the executing agency, the IMARG, has sufficient financial \nmanagement capacity and experience with ADB policies and procedures. No major financial \nmanagement issues have been identified at the municipal governments and financial intermediary \nthat  will  act  as  the  program\u2019s  implementing  agencies.  Two  PIEs\u2014the  privately  owned \nXiaoweiyang and the state-owned enterprise (SOE) Yixin\u2014have sound financial management \nsystems, but the capacity of the third PIE (Songbuer SOE) is relatively weak. The financial \nmanagement risk is substantial, and the executing and implementing agencies and the PIEs have \nagreed to implement an action plan to mitigate it by addressing the key deficiencies. Yixin and \nSongbuer will strengthen their governance, financial management, and audit and disclosure \nsystems by participating in the program and meeting ADB requirements. This will also serve to \n \n30 ADB. 2018. Handbook for the Classification and Economic Analysis of Regional Projects.

Integrity \ndue diligence on the financial intermediaries and Xiaoweiyang identified no significant risks. \n \n37.  Procurement. A strategic procurement planning exercise (summarized in Appendix 13 of \nthe FAM) has been undertaken to ensure value for money through choosing optimal procurement \narrangements for subproject activities. The overall pre-mitigation procurement risk for tranche 1 \nactivities is considered moderate. With assistance from ADB and the project implementation \nconsultants, the IMAR project management office and PIEs will have adequate capacity to comply \nwith the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Procurement under the \nFIL will be undertaken in accordance with commercial practices acceptable to ADB. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and Integrity Principles and Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time) were explained to and discussed with the governments of the PRC \nand IMAR. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in FAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n38.  ADB\u2019s poverty and social analysis indicate that the program\u2019s tranche 1 activities will \nbenefit 2.95 million people in Erenhot and Baotou municipalities  through greater livelihood \nopportunities for the poor and the population overall. Socioeconomic benefits will arise from \nimproved border facilities and connectivity, growth in  cross-border economic activities, and \ndevelopment of the inclusive sheep-farming value chain. Health care services will be enhanced, \nas will environmental and living conditions the Erenhot BCP area. Financial intermediation \nonlending to SMEs engaged in cross-border trade and logistics, agribusiness, manufacturing, and \ntourism will create jobs and raise incomes. The benefits will spill over to the adjacent border areas \nof Mongolia, where the impact will be especially strong on a smaller population base with generally \nlower income levels. \n \n39.  Gender. Tranche 1 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A minimum target \nhas been set for providing financial intermediation subloans to SMEs owned or led by women. \nADB and the IMARG have prepared a social development and gender action plan that will give \nwomen access to 600 newly generated jobs. The plan aims to enhance the capacity of women \nemployees  at  the  Erenhot  and  Mandula  BCPs,  the  international  hospital,  and  government \nagencies. It requires that cross-border and customs facilities have gender-sensitive designs and \npromotes the participation of low-income households headed by women in the PAP. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n40.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program\u2019s tranche 1 \nactivities have been assigned safeguard categories.33 \n \n41.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  report  and \nenvironmental management plan have been prepared for tranche 1 activities, which confirm that \nthe project will not result in significant adverse environmental impacts that are irreversible, \ndiverse, or unprecedented. Implementation of the environmental management plan will prevent \nor mitigate any minimal adverse environmental impacts. ADB conducted information disclosure \nand meaningful public consultations on the project activities during the subproject design and will \ncontinue to do so throughout implementation. The IMARG will establish a program-level grievance \nredress mechanism to handle environmental complaints. The Erenhot and Baotou municipal \n \n33 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "14 \ngovernments have the capacity to meet the increased demand for materials and municipal \nservices for expanding the infrastructure and facilities under the program. ADB has prepared an \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  to  guide  the  screening,  categorization, \nassessment, planning, and institutional arrangements for subsequent tranches.  \n \n42.  Environmental and social management system for financial intermediaries. The \nBank of Inner Mongolia will adopt an environmental and social management system (ESMS) prior \nto loan effectiveness that will cover environmental and social policies; safeguard screening, \ncategorization, and review; institutional arrangements; and monitoring and reporting procedures. \nThe FIL will not fund any subprojects that are on the prohibited investment activities list of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement or will trigger category A safeguards for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, or indigenous people. Although its ability to implement the ESMS is weak, the Bank \nof Inner Mongolia has established ESMS units and assigned staff to be trained to implement the \nESMS independently and properly assess the environmental and social impacts of proposed FIL \nsubprojects. \n \n43.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Three households with family members up to 12 \npersons will lose 0.6%\u20131.6% of their total grassland through acquisitions for the Mandula port \nsubproject of 1,170.77 mu34 of land, including 808.66 mu of state-owned land and 279.11 mu of \nvillage collective land (grassland). The impact is deemed not significant. All works for the Erenhot \nsubproject will be on state-owned land, and due diligence showed no outstanding or legacy \nissues.  A resettlement plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  investment  program,  as  well  as  a \nresettlement framework for the program\u2019s subsequent tranches. \n \n44.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Tranche 1 activities are not expected to trigger ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement for indigenous peoples. Ethnic minority groups comprise 12.4% of \nErenhot\u2019s population, the largest being Mongolian (93%) and Manchu (5.4%). However, these \ngroups are widely dispersed through the municipality and will enjoy the same benefits from the \ninvestment program as the ethnic Han majority. An ethnic minority development framework has \nbeen prepared to guide the screening of subproject impacts on ethnic minorities in subsequent \ntranches and prepare ethnic minority development plans if ADB\u2019s indigenous peoples safeguard \nis triggered. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n45.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures and Management Plan \nQualified  staff  and  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  support  the \nInadequate institutional and staff capacity \nexecuting agency, implementing agencies, and PIEs. \nto properly implement the investment \nTraining  will  be  provided  on  program  implementation,  including \nprogram, particularly procurement \nprocurement, financial, and safeguards management. \nFinancial management staff will receive training on ADB financial \nLack of implementing agency and PIE \nmanagement, reporting policies, and disbursement procedures during \nexperience in financial management of \nprogram implementation. \nADB projects \nCapacity  building  will  be  conducted  for  officials  at  all  levels  of \nImplementation delays because of the \nGovernment  in  IMAR.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n46.  The governments of the PRC and IMAR have assured ADB that implementation of the \ninvestment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n47.  The governments of the PRC and IMAR have given certain undertakings for the MFF, \nwhich are set forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the \ngovernments of the PRC and IMAR with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set \nforth in the loan agreement and project agreements for the respective tranches. \n \n48.  Conditions for withdrawal. No withdrawals will be made from the ADB loan account (i) \nfor the purposes of the Xiaoweiyang subproject until the IMARG and Xiaoweiyang have entered \ninto the relevant project implementation agreement on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB; \nor (ii) for the financial intermediation modality loan until the IMARG and the relevant financial \nintermediary have entered into an onlending agreement on terms and conditions acceptable to \nADB, and each financial intermediary has established an ESMS satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n49.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the multitranche financing facility to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Inner Mongolia \nSustainable Cross-Border Development Investment Program in an aggregate principal amount \nnot exceeding the equivalent of \u20ac356,295,000, which comprises the provision of loans from ADB's \nordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest and other terms to be determined in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; and is \nsubject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the framework financing agreement presented to the Board.  \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n30 September 2020 \n ", "16  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nImpact the Investment Program is aligned with \nSustainable economic development and shared prosperity for CAREC region achieveda \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with Targets \nResults Chain  Reporting  Risks \nand Baselines \nMechanisms \nOutcome  By 2031:     \nSustainable economic  a.
