INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Central Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008) \nincludes regional technical assistance (TA) for the Maintenance of Regional Road Transport \nCorridors Project.1 The governments of Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan were consulted during \nthe preparation of the TA, and an understanding was reached on the objectives, scope, costs, \nterms  of  reference,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  TA.2In  addition,  an  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Fact-Finding Mission visited Kyrgyz Republic in March 2005, carried \nout  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment,  and  discussed  project-related  issues  with \ngovernment officials. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Increasing trade is a key to accelerating economic growth and reducing poverty in \nCentral Asia, particularly in Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, with their small populations and \nlimited natural resources (except for hydropower). Even in the Central Asian republics (CARs) \nwith  more  natural  resources,  the  contribution  of  trade  to  increased  economic  growth  is \nconstrained  by  their  landlocked  status  and  distances  to  ocean  ports.  Improvement  of  the \nregional road network is therefore essential to increase economic growth. Three core problems \nconstrain the development of regional road transport in the CARs: (i) lack of a unified regulatory \nframework that encourages competition, (ii) delays and excessive charges at borders, and (iii) \nphysical  deterioration  of  the  network.3 ADB  is  involved  in  solving  all  these  problems.  The \nTransport Sector Coordinating Committee\u2019s work under the CAREC4 program is addressing the \ndevelopment of a unified regulatory framework. Regional cooperation in improving customs \nprocessing is being promoted under ADB-financed regional projects.5 The deterioration of the \nroad network is being addressed through a two-pronged approach. First, ADB is continuing its \nassistance program to improve roads within the regional network. Second, implementation of \nthese projects includes policy dialogue to increase financing for road maintenance and to carry \nout institutional reforms to improve the efficiency of the maintenance system.  \n \n3.  The regional road network in Central Asia directly links Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. Key sections of this \nnetwork are located in Kyrgyz Republic, including the Bishkek\u2013Osh, Osh\u2013Sary Tash-Irkeshtam, \nSary Tash\u2013Karamik (Tajikistan border), and other roads. More broadly, this network is part of a \nlarger network providing links to the ocean ports of Pakistan and Iran to the south, and to the \nRussian Federation to the north. When the Soviet Union was in existence, the regional road \nnetwork existed only as part of an internal network, with no links to Afghanistan or PRC. \nFollowing the breakup of the Soviet Union, the condition of the national roads comprising the \nnetwork deteriorated substantially because of decreased financing for road maintenance in most \ncountries (due to budget constraints) and civil conflict in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. However, \nthe situation has been improving over the last several years because financing for maintenance \nhas generally been increasing and the civil conflicts have ended. Many of the most deteriorated \nsections of the regional road network are being rehabilitated with the help of ADB and other \ninternational  and  bilateral  agencies.  ADB-financed  projects,  many  of  which  have  been \n                                                 \n1  Formerly entitled Regional Transport Corridors Road Maintenance and Safety Project. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 19 May 2005.  \n3  ADB. 2002.

Manila. ", "2   \n \ncompleted, are improving sections of the network in Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and other \nCARs. However, ADB\u2019s TA on Institutional Support in the Transport Sector,6 has found that \nremaining sections of the regional network and other roads in Kyrgyz Republic will also need \nrehabilitation, if periodic maintenance is not carried out in the near future. The road network in \nTajikistan is in a similar deteriorated state due to inadequate maintenance. Other international \ninstitutions, including the World Bank, European Union, and the Islamic Development Bank, are \npreparing road rehabilitation or maintenance projects in these countries, and the TA consultants \nwill coordinate with them to maximize results. \n \n4.  Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan are mountainous, landlocked countries. They are among \nthe poorest countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU), with per capita gross domestic products \nof $430 and $310, respectively, in 2004. About 39% of the population of Kyrgyz Republic7 and \n64% of the population of Tajikistan8 were estimated to be living in poverty in 2004 and 2003, \nrespectively. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. Economic growth resumed \nin the mid-1990s, although it has been uneven due to events such as the Russian financial \ncrisis of 1998. Among the factors responsible for the continuing high levels of poverty is the \ndifficulty of developing external and domestic markets for domestic products. This results not \nonly from the landlocked nature of the countries, but also barriers to trade and transit, limited \nnatural resources, and the small size of the domestic markets. Achievement of sustainable \neconomic growth depends upon enhancing access to regional markets and diversifying exports. \nThe National Poverty Reduction Strategy of Kyrgyz Republic emphasizes the importance of \npromoting regional cooperation and improving transport links to increase exports.   \n \n5.  Road transport dominates the countries\u2019 transport systems. About 18,900 kilometers (km) \nof  roads  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunications  (MOTC),  including  9,900  km  of  national  roads.  The  Tajikistan  Ministry  of \nTransport (MOT) has jurisdiction over 13,800 km, including 4,800 km of national roads. In both \ncountries, there are more than 12,000 km of roads outside the ministries\u2019 jurisdiction, mainly \nrural and farm roads. As with most other republics of the FSU, the economic crisis stemming \nfrom the breakup resulted in a decline in economic activity and disrupted customary trading \npatterns. The demand for transport has fallen dramatically since independence, and reached its \nlowest level in the mid-1990s. Although demand for passenger and freight transport has been \ngrowing  since  the  mid-1990s,  except  for  the  setback  from  the  1998  financial crisis  in  the \nRussian Federation, the coverage of the road networks is generally adequate for the countries\u2019 \ndevelopment  needs.  Consequently,  the  primary  concern  is  proper  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation to preserve the existing networks, which suffer from widespread deterioration. \nMOTC  and  MOT  are  responsible  for  policy  making  as  well  as  regulating,  planning,  and \ndeveloping  transport  and  communications  in  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan,  respectively, \nincluding  roads,  railways,  and  aviation.  Both  ministries  have  roads  departments  that  are \nresponsible for managing the road subsector and regional road maintenance agencies that are \nresponsible for maintaining the roads under the ministries\u2019 jurisdiction. The regional agencies \nare composed of local road maintenance units that carry out maintenance works.  \n \n6.  The state budget allocations for road rehabilitation and maintenance in both countries \nvary from year to year according to the governments\u2019 priorities and fiscal constraints. Due to \ngeneral fiscal constraints and allocations to projects of strategic importance, expenditures on \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001.

", "  3\nroad maintenance and rehabilitation have been much lower than what was needed to maintain \nthe road networks at an acceptable level. ADB has been addressing the inadequate financing \nfor road maintenance through policy dialogue and TA. ADB\u2019s initial strategy in Kyrgyz Republic \nwas to assist the Government in establishing a road fund to finance road maintenance and other \nsector expenditures. Through policy dialogue and with the assistance of ADB-financed TA, the \nGovernment passed the Road Fund Act in 1998 and made it operational, e.g., by establishing \nthe revenue sources for the fund and maintaining the separate road fund account. Prior to 2000, \nTajikistan\u2019s road subsector expenditures were financed from the road fund, the state budget, \nand development agencies. In practice, however, only half of the road fund collection was \nallocated  to  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance;  the  other  half  was  used  to  fund  new \nconstruction. The separate budget accounts for the road funds were either terminated or never \nestablished, as part of consolidation of the national budgets, to address the countries\u2019 severe \nfiscal problems and in accordance with International Monetary Fund recommendations.9 The \ntaxes and receipts formerly contributing to the road funds are still collected, but now are paid \ndirectly to the national treasuries. Road maintenance and construction are funded now from the \ngeneral state budget. ADB therefore modified its strategy to focus on providing maintenance \nfunds through the governments\u2019 standard budget procedures. The strategy emphasizes the \nprovision of (i) sufficient financing for the roads rehabilitated under projects financed by ADB \nand cofinanciers, thus ensuring the sustainability of the governments\u2019 investments; and (ii) \nincreased levels of financing for maintaining all other roads under MOTC and MOT jurisdiction, \nto the extent possible given the countries\u2019 fiscal constraints. Ongoing ADB road subsector \nprojects in both countries include loan covenants on road maintenance financing to ensure that \nthese goals are met. The covenants require annual increases in allocations for maintenance, \nand specified levels of expenditures on roads rehabilitated under ADB-financed projects.  \n \n7.  ADB is also assisting in the improvement of maintenance through policy dialogue and \nTA. The Government of Kyrgyz Republic and ADB agreed on an action plan for developing and \nimplementing a new strategy to ensure adequate road maintenance. The strategy consists of (i) \ndeveloping  new  approaches  to  provide  and  allocate  funding  for  road  maintenance,  (ii) \ncontinuing compliance with the maintenance-financing covenant for recently rehabilitated roads, \nand (iii) using border-crossing fees to finance maintenance of the Osh-Irkeshtam road and other \nMOTC roads. Also, the advisory TA for Improving Road Maintenance and Strengthening the \nTransport Corridor Management Department10 in Kyrgyz Republic, will develop a new system to \nprioritize the road network, estimate maintenance costs for the road categories, develop a \nmethodology  for  allocating  maintenance  expenditures,  and  develop  alternative  means  for \nmaintenance (such as community-based maintenance) that do not rely substantially on the \nnational budget. In Tajikistan, the Strengthening Implementation of Road Maintenance TA11 will \ndevelop  a  road  maintenance  strategy  and  program  through  road  network  definition  and \nprioritization, preparation of maintenance strategies and budgets, and preparing reforms and \ninstitutional arrangements for road maintenance. \n \n8.  The  regional  TA  will  support  the  strategies  of  ADB  and  the  governments.  The \nGovernment of Kyrgyz Republic's policy objectives for transport include adequately maintaining \n                                                 \n9  These were first-generation funds that did not have features such as administration by an independent board found \nin second-generation funds.

To achieve the sector objectives, the Government's strategy aims to (i) \nincrease the financial provision for rehabilitating and maintaining the road network, and (ii) \npromote  private  sector  participation  in  road  maintenance.  The  Government  of  Tajikistan\u2019s \nstrategy for the road subsector is to rehabilitate and maintain road infrastructure and to develop \nan efficient road transport industry, including developing international road corridors to facilitate \ninternational trade. The TA will assist the governments in implementing their strategies for the \nroad subsector by addressing road maintenance and improving international corridors. The TA \nwill directly support ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program, in particular, improving \neconomic cooperation to reduce transport costs and to facilitate trade.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the regional \u0422\u0410 will be to make transport on the regional and national road \nnetworks more efficient. The outcomes of the TA will be preparation of (i) a project, suitable for \nADB financing, to promote regional cooperation by carrying out periodic road maintenance and \nimplementing measures to improve safety on roads in Kyrgyz Republic comprising parts of key \nregional transport corridors in Central Asia; and (ii) a maintenance program for regional transport \ncorridors in Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, based on lessons learned from other ADB-financed \nTAs and pilot approaches. The maintenance program will be designed for use in other CARs that \nhave similar topographic and climatic conditions. The project to be prepared under the TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s Central Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008) \nas a firm project for 2007.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  To prepare the ensuing project, the TA will include (i) an update of the transport sector \nprofile for Kyrgyz Republic, including financial status, road safety, road maintenance, and traffic \nmanagement; (ii) a review of the status of institutional development and policy reforms in the \nroad  subsector  initiated  under  previous  projects;  (iii)  selection  of  a  preliminary  list  and \ndetermination of a prioritized final list of roads comprising key regional transport corridors and \nother important national roads to be included in the project; (iv) cost estimates and the technical, \neconomic, and financial feasibility study for the roads comprising the project; (v) preparation of a \nprogram for maintaining key regional transport corridors in Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, \nincluding the project roads, including an evaluation of tendering maintenance and the use of \nlocal labor; (vi) an environmental impact assessment; (vii) a poverty and social impact analysis; \nand (viii) analysis of the need for further advisory TA for the road subsector. The outline terms of \nreference for the consulting services are in Appendix 3. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent, consisting of $283,000 in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $367,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide \n$500,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $217,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government of Kyrgyz Republic will finance the \nbalance  of  the  local  currency  cost  equivalent  of  $150,000  by  providing  required  office \naccommodation and services, local communications, remuneration and per diem for counterpart \nstaff, and other items, mostly in kind. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA ", "  5\ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost estimates for the TA are shown \nin Appendix 4. \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The governments have agreed that the Executing Agency for the TA will be MOTC in \nKyrgyz Republic, the location of the roads to be studied for the ensuing project. MOTC will \ndesignate one of its project implementation units for ADB-financed projects and appoint a project \ncoordinator to be responsible for the TA's day-to-day implementation and to provide administrative \nand technical support to the consultants. MOTC\u2019s existing project steering committee will monitor \nthe TA's implementation.  \n \n13.  An international consulting firm in association with domestic consultants will be selected \nand engaged by ADB, using the quality and cost-based selection method. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants12 and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The simplified \ntechnical proposal procedure will be used to select the consultants. A total of about 10 person-\nmonths of international and 30 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required. In \naddition,  there  will  be  a  lump-sum  input  of  $120,000  to  cover  local  consulting  services  for \nengineering and traffic surveys, as well as for preparing the preliminary design for the periodic \nmaintenance works. The consultants will have extensive experience in (i) transport economics, \nincluding related financial management; (ii) technical and financial aspects of road maintenance \nand road safety; (iii) economic evaluation of road projects; (iv) highway engineering, including \nmountainous topography, bridges, and drainage structures; and (v) environmental, social, and \npoverty  impact  assessments.  To  facilitate  the  work  and  ensure  that  MOTC  gains  technical \nexpertise and knowledge, the consultant team will work closely with counterpart technical experts \nfrom MOTC. MOTC has agreed to provide the counterpart technical staff, who will assist with the \nnecessary surveys and fieldwork in a timely manner. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  about  7  months  beginning  in  June  2006.  The \nconsultants will submit (i) an inception report, including a proposed list of roads for further \nanalysis, within 1 month of the commencement of their services; (ii) an interim report within 3 \nmonths; (iii) a draft final report within 6 months, including the environmental, social, and poverty \nimpact assessment reports and the maintenance program as separate documents; and (iv) a \nfinal report within 3 weeks after the receipt of comments from the governments and ADB. The \nExecuting Agency, ADB, and the consultants will meet in Bishkek to review and endorse the \ninception, interim, and draft final reports. The consultants will conduct seminars for MOTC staff \nand any other interested government organizations concerning the techniques, analysis, and \nfindings of the TA. Equipment to be provided under the TA will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.13 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.

In consultation with MOTC and based on the outputs from TA 3757-KGZ (footnote 2) \nand other TAs, identify road sections of regional transport corridors in Kyrgyz Republic and \nother  important  national  roads  included  in  the  principal  road  network  for  further  study  for \npossible  inclusion  in  the  proposed  project  of  periodic  maintenance  and/or  road  safety \nimprovements.  The  periodic  maintenance  works  may  include  patching,  surface  treatment, \noverlays, and repairs of bridges and road structures. The works will not include rehabilitation, \nreconstruction,  or  new  construction,  and  will  not  require  any  resettlement  or  have  any \nresettlement impacts. The selection will be based on regional importance and linkage to other \nregional corridors, traffic volumes, and other quantifiable criteria which will be listed in the \ninception report. The roads proposed for detailed analysis will be listed in the interim report. \n \n7.  Analyze and prioritize the prescreened road sections agreed on by the Government and \nADB. The analysis will include traffic counts and projections, economic analysis, environmental \nimpact, and social and poverty impact, as described below. The final set of roads analyzed under \nthe TA should comprise a project totaling about $30 million. \n \n8.  Conduct traffic counts at appropriate locations; conduct origin-destination and axle-load \nsurveys  to  establish  the  pattern  and  volume  of  vehicle,  passenger,  and  cargo  movements, \nincluding details on passenger characteristics and types of freight being shipped. Assess the \npossibilities of passenger and freight traffic diversion from other routes. Prepare traffic forecasts by \nrepresentative  vehicle  type,  taking  into  account  economic  and population growth, production \nincrease, economic activity, and income in the hinterland of the project road. Identify and forecast \ninternational traffic and transnational transit traffic separately. \n \n9.  Carry out topographic surveys, as required, and prepare alignment plans, longitudinal \nsections, cross-sections, and drainage surveys. Review pavement condition and strength through \nvisual inspection, roughness measurement, deflection measurements, and other tests as required. \nBased  on  the  investigation  results,  determine  the  most  cost-effective  means  of  periodic \nmaintenance to accommodate the forecast traffic and meet national and international standards. \nUndertake  necessary  preliminary  engineering  design,  including  appropriate  maintenance \nmeasures in the forms of patching, crack sealing, surface treatments and overlays, shoulder re-\ngraveling or re-graveling of unsealed gravel roads; cleaning of drainage structures and river \ntraining  facilities;  providing  preventive  measures  against  slope  instability,  cleaning  and \nstrengthening of existing retaining walls, gabions and other structures; as well as providing, \nimproving, and restoring traffic safety features. Estimate and prepare a bill of quantities and \nengineering estimate for each road based on the analysis of current international and local \ncontracts and current market prices in Kyrgyz Republic for major inputs in terms of labor, \nequipment  and  materials;  and  provide  recommendations  on  packaging  the  projects  and \nimplementation  arrangements  for  contracting  out  under  ADB\u2019s  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedure. Confirm the suitability of locally available construction materials, and identify quarries \nand borrow pits. If warranted by social surveys, include in the preliminary design possible locations \nfor \u201croadside stations\u201d (for provision of roadside services, sale of local goods, etc.). \n \n10.  Prepare cost estimates for the road sections, indicating a breakdown of foreign and local \ncosts and tax and duty components. Also, prepare cost estimates for maintenance of the project \nroad following project completion based on country- and site-specific factors. Assess the financial \nsustainability of the proposed project, including: (i) projecting the forward incremental recurrent \ncosts associated with the project, (ii) assessing forward debt service obligation, (iii) comparing ", "12  Appendix 3 \ntotal forward cash outlay requirements against current MOTC budget, and (iv) presenting a \nconclusion with respect to the sustainability of the project. \n \n11.  Calculate economic vehicle operating costs for each homogenous road section, with and \nwithout the proposed improvements, based on estimated changes in road surface roughness, and \nquantify  the  benefits  (using  shadow  prices)  for  each  project  road  section  and  for  each \nimprovement option. These benefits (or savings) should include those generated from reduced \ntravel distance, road maintenance savings, reduction in road accident costs, etc.  \n \n12.  Undertake  an  economic  evaluation  of  all  project  components,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997), by comparing the with- and without-\nproject  cases.  Calculate  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  and  net  present  value  for  the \nindividual project components and the overall project. Benefits from increased agricultural and \nother production as well as increased trade should also be examined and quantified, if relevant. \nEstimate separately the benefits arising from international traffic. Also, examine nonquantifiable \nimpacts  such  as  regional  and  national  economic  development,  improved  road  safety,  etc. \nConsidering  the  economic  evaluation,  least-cost  analysis,  social  benefits,  and  environmental \nimpact, recommend the most suitable periodic maintenance options and rank them by priority. \nUndertake sensitivity tests on the recommended improvements by appropriately varying benefits, \nproject costs, implementation period, expected overall future volume of traffic, traffic dimension, \ninadequate maintenance following project completion, and a combination of these factors. Carry \nout  quantitative  risk  analysis  by  considering  the  possible  values  for  key  variables  and  the \nprobability that they may occur. Recommend ways by which project risks may be reduced. Provide \ntraining and/or seminars on aspects of conducting feasibility studies, or other road subsector \ntopics related to the TA, as requested by MOTC, and approved by ADB. \n \n13.  Estimate the expected distribution of project net benefits first among countries in the \nregion, and second among users of freight and passenger transport, vehicle owners, labor, the \nGovernment, the economy in general, and, where appropriate, lenders.  \n \n14.  Formulate,  in  a  participatory  manner,  a  detailed  project  design  and  monitoring \nframework and performance management system for monitoring and evaluating project impact, \noutcome, outputs, and activities during implementation and for post-evaluation, including poverty \nreduction objectives. Collect preliminary baseline data for the indicators and targets, including \nmitigation measures. Emphasize indicators for which data can be collected by the executing \nagency  during  and  after  implementation.  Prepare  appropriate  formats,  schedules,  and  cost \nestimates  for  collecting  baseline  data  for  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  following  project \ncompletion. \n \n15.  Study developments in the road construction industry and assess the capacity of local \ncontractors involved in road construction and maintenance in terms of financial, technical, and \nhuman resources. Provide recommendations on contracting out road maintenance works under \nthe project through ADB\u2019s local competitive bidding procedure. \n \nC.  Maintenance Program \n16.  Prepare  a  program  for  maintenance  of  key  regional  transport  corridors  in  Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Tajikistan, including the project roads. Preparation should (i) incorporate findings \nof other ADB-financed TAs; (ii) include consultations with the transport and finance ministries in \nboth countries, other concerned agencies, and local road construction contractors; (iii) take into \naccount  analyses  from  previous  road  maintenance  studies  and  pilot  cases  of  tendering ", "Appendix 3    13\n \nmaintenance  under  other  ADB-financed  projects;  (iv)  evaluate  tendering  some  or  all \nmaintenance  activities,  and  provide  recommendations  for  institutionalizing  commercial \npractices; (v) evaluate procurement of maintenance equipment and the use of local labor; and \n(vi) include a plan for monitoring and addressing impacts of such natural events as landslides \nand floods. The maintenance program will be designed for use in other Central Asian republics \nwith similar topographic and climatic conditions. \n \nD.  Social and Poverty Impact Assessment  \n17.  Undertake a social analysis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Incorporation of \nSocial Dimensions in Bank Operations, Handbook of Social and Poverty Analysis, Handbook for \nIntegrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects, Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects, and Handbook of Social and Poverty Analysis. The analysis will \n(i) identify the affected population and potential beneficiaries; (ii) assess various population \ngroups\u2019 stages of development, and prepare socioeconomic profiles based on indicators; (iii) \nassess the project\u2019s gender impact and potential impact on HIV/AIDS; (iv) assess the needs of \nthe affected population and their expectations about the project; and (v) assess the affected \npopulation\u2019s  absorptive  capacity  to  benefit  from  the  project,  and  potential  to  participate  in \nimplementing the project, e.g., from using \u201croadside stations.\u201d Based on findings of the social \nanalysis,  recommend  mitigation  measures  for  incorporation  into  the  project  design  and \nimplementation, including components for the monitoring and evaluation program. Prepare a \nsocial action plan recommending features for the project design and actions the Government \ncan take to (i) increase poor people\u2019s use of the road, (ii) improve poor people\u2019s involvement in \nthe project, and (iii) extend project benefits and participation opportunities specifically to women \nin order to maximize the project\u2019s positive impact on the poor. \n \n18.  Ensure that the project will involve no relocation or resettlement of affected people (in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement), especially the poor, women, and ethnic \nminorities, including impact on land within the right-of-way that is being used by local residents. \nIf resettlement impacts or a potential for such impacts is unavoidable, assist the Government in \npreparing a time-bound resettlement framework or resettlement plan for land acquisition and \nresettlement  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  policy  and  Government  laws.  Provide \nrecommendations to the Government on developing policies or enforcement measures for right-\nof-way management, including clearance of structures in a socially acceptable manner. Review \nand assess the project\u2019s impacts on ethnic minorities, if any, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy \non Indigenous Peoples, including adverse impacts and distribution of benefits.  \n \n19.  Assist  MOTC  and  local  governments  (if  appropriate)  in  conducting  stakeholder \nconsultations on social, environmental, poverty, and other project impacts. The consultations \nshould be conducted with different socioeconomic groups and documented in accordance with \nADB practice (including dates, places, participants, and issues discussed). Prepare a program \nof follow-up consultations during and after project implementation.

Analyze the survey data and interviews. \n \n20.  Provide an overview of the objectives of the national policy for poverty reduction and of \nthe poverty-reduction activities of other funding agencies, including a list and brief description of \nother projects under implementation in the project area. Describe how the project relates to the \noverall context of and strategy for poverty reduction in Kyrgyz Republic. Prepare poverty impact \nanalysis in accordance with ADB guidelines. Analyze the survey data to assess (i) the adequacy \nof and competitiveness within the transport services market; (ii) how fares and charges are \ndetermined; (iii) to what extent cost savings for vehicle owners will be passed on to final users; \n(iv) the extent to which enhanced capacity and reduced costs may lead to additional economic \nactivities; (v) the extent to which the poor, very poor, women, and other vulnerable people use \nthe road and associated transport services; and (vi) opportunities to enhance project benefits for \nthe poor and participation of women. Estimate the number of poor and extremely poor people \nwho will benefit from the project, based on the distribution analysis and in accordance with ADB \nguidelines. Identify constraints to poor people\u2019s direct or indirect use of the project road (i.e., \navailability and affordability of transport services, vehicle ownership, etc.), taking into account \naspects related to gender and vulnerable people. Assess and quantify the likely involvement \nand employment of poor local people during the construction.  \n \nE.  Initial Environmental Examination  \n21.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines (2003), prepare an initial environmental examination (IEE) and a summary IEE for the \nproject roads. This activity should include profiles of the environment and the required mitigation \nmeasures in the design, construction, and maintenance of the roads. Ensure that the consultation \nprocess satisfactorily addresses environmental issues. If the IEE indicates that adverse impacts \nare  likely,  prepare  a  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  report  covering  mitigation \nmeasures for the project roads, and draft any proposed mitigation measures that will be required \nfor inclusion in the general conditions of contract. Mitigation measures to be considered during \ndesign include, but are not limited to, alignment, slope stability, slope erosion, flooding, and \npedestrian safety.
