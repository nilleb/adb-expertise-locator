INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  strengthen  partnership \nmechanisms and working relationships between public and private stakeholders of the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program, with the aim of developing integrated \nand business-friendly transport and trade networks.1 The TA will continue to provide opportunities \nfor greater private sector engagement in and contribution to effective trade facilitation in CAREC \nmember countries, strengthen private sector institutions and capacity, and contribute to a better \nunderstanding of current logistics services and behind-the-border issues that hinder trade.2 \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with CAREC long-term strategic priorities for trade as an operational \ncluster,3 and Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional cooperation and integration operational \ndirections for 2016\u20132020.4 It supports objectives of the CAREC Integrated Trade Agenda 2030,5 \nparticularly the expansion of trade by adopting more open trade policies and building customs-to-\nbusiness cooperation, and the strengthening of institutions for trade via increased public\u2013private \nsector dialogue and cooperation.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n3.  CAREC countries\u2019 share of global trade remains low at less than 1.0%, despite proximity \nto major trading partners and significant investment in connectivity infrastructure.7 The region still \nstruggles  with  inadequate  border  infrastructure,  topographic  challenges,  nonphysical  trade \nbarriers such as the lack of regional coherence in logistics and standards, and weak institutional \ncapacity to facilitate efficient transport and trade of goods: in 2018, eight CAREC countries ranked \nin the bottom half of the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index.8 The slow uptake of modern \ntechnologies and trade-related solutions, such as national electronic single windows, hinders \nefficient trade flow. CAREC corridor performance measurement and monitoring (CPMM) data \nshow that less effective transit and border procedures cause bottlenecks at border-crossing points \n(BCPs), that delay trade and raise costs for business throughout the region:9 during 2010-2018, \nthe average road BCP crossing time increased by 47% to 12 hours, off-set only slightly by a 9.0% \ndrop in costs to clear the BCP.10 An incomplete understanding of transport, logistics, and behind-\nthe-border value-chain issues in the region further constrains effective cross-border and transit \ntrade. Although these challenges directly impact private sector trade, CAREC countries have not \n \n1  The CAREC Program is a partnership of 11 countries\u2014Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, Pakistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan\u2014and \ndevelopment partners, working together to accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction.

With the support of ADB and development partners, CAREC customs and trade-related \nagencies are developing regulatory and operational frameworks to facilitate trade and build \nmodern customs administrations.11 However, effective and sustainable facilitation is only possible \nwith the strong involvement of trade-related private sector representation in policy dialogue and \noperations, to share private sector experience and evaluation. Business-to-customs interaction \nrequires a robust enabling environment to  enable private sector contribution to policy and \nregulatory reform. As CAREC governments develop customs-to-business initiatives such as \ncompliance programs, including authorized economic operator (AEO) programs,12 much stronger \npartnership with the private sector client base is key to sustainable implementation and success. \nLack of opportunities to encourage public\u2013private coordination in policy formulation as well as \ninadequate collaboration in operations has led to an environment of segmented transport and \ntrade networks, where public and private sectors work in parallel\u2014rather than together\u2014to find \nsolutions to the transport and trade challenges they all face. \n \n5.  The ADB-supported CAREC Federation of Carrier and Forwarder Associations (CFCFA) \nseeks to increase private sector engagement in trade facilitation, enhancing cooperation between \npublic and private trade-related entities across the region.13 ADB TA support to the CFCFA has \nprovided a voice to private sector transport and trade stakeholders through participation in (i) \nCAREC Ministerial Conferences, Senior Officials\u2019 Meetings, and joint meetings with the CAREC \nCustoms Cooperation Committee (CCC) to build public-private collaboration on trade facilitation \nreform; and (ii) business development forums. Supply chain and trade logistics trainings have \nstrengthened operational understanding of regulators and operators, and helped the CFCFA start \ndeveloping common logistics operational standards for the CAREC region to minimize the time \nand cost of cargo transshipment and cross-border transport. CAREC customs agencies have \nbenefited from greater client interaction and evaluation of private sector experience at BCPs \nthrough the CPMM. Despite ADB support to the CFCFA, the organization has yet to develop into \na fully independent operational entity. Assessment of previous TA support has recommended \nadopting a solutions-oriented approach focused on realistic shorter-term targets alongside longer-\nterm goals to stimulate private sector engagement and effective collective action in the CFCFA.14  \n \n6.  CPMM data constitute (i) a unique measurement of trade facilitation along the CAREC \ntransport corridors, and (ii) the basis of cross-country analyses that identify BCPs and CAREC \ncorridor  sections  where  time-  and  cost-related  bottlenecks  are  most  prevalent,  and  where \nfeasibility studies for investment are most urgent. The current focus of CPMM reports on transit \nand border procedures informs customs officials and policy makers, as well as traders and freight \n \n11  ADB.

Guided by CPMM data and analysis \nfor 2010-2017, ADB has financed three BCP improvement projects in four CAREC countries.15 \nUnder the TA, the CPMM scope will be expanded to contribute more comprehensively to policy \nformulation by including more detailed analysis of behind-the-border issues such as structural \nreforms and standards agencies, sanitary and phytosanitary laboratory capacity, and trade \nfacilitation regulations. Given its success in effective monitoring of national trade facilitation efforts \nand its evidence-based contributions to policy, the CPMM is ready to be implemented and \ndisseminated to a wider public and private sector audience in the CAREC region. As such, a \npartnership will be implemented between ADB and the CAREC Institute to transfer data gathering \nand management of the CPMM to the CAREC Institute. Under the TA, ADB and the CAREC \nInstitute will jointly prepare and implement a CPMM roadmap to guide this transition and to include \nrequired capacity building to the CAREC Institute.  \n \n7.  At the Fifth Joint Meeting of the CAREC CCC and the CFCFA, CAREC customs agencies \nand CFCFA members requested ADB to continue support for joint activities, particularly relating \nto the development and application of compliance programs.16 Customs agencies requested ADB \nto  facilitate  collaboration  with  CFCFA  national  associations  as  they  enhance  CPMM  data \ngathering, and to expand the CPMM mechanism to include deeper and wider analysis of behind-\nthe-border  trade-related  barriers.  The  annual  meeting  of  the  CAREC  Transport  Sector \nCoordinating Committee expressed a desire to coordinate more closely with the CFCFA and \ncontribute to CPMM data gathering and analysis.17 The CFCFA, CCC, and CAREC Transport \nSector Coordinating Committee also requested ADB to develop public domain digital database \nsystems for CPMM data dissemination. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) trade among CAREC countries and with \nglobal markets via CAREC corridors expanded (footnote 3); and (ii) linkages between public and \ntrade-related private sector strengthened (footnote 5). The TA will have the following outcome: \nintegrated and business-friendly transport and trade public\u2013private sector linkages enhanced.18 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n  \n9.  Output 1: Private sector involvement in trade facilitation expanded. To strengthen \noperational linkages between public and private sectors in CAREC countries, the TA will (i) \ncontinue support for joint public\u2013private advocacy for national authorized economic operator \nprograms that offer beneficial simplified customs processes and procedures, building strong \npartnerships from the start through consultative dialogue between the CAREC CCC and CFCFA \nplatforms; (ii) support specific components of the wider private sector initiative to develop industry-\n \n15  Regional border services improvement projects coordinate infrastructure  improvements and border crossing \nclearance procedures in the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.

Output 2: Institutional capacity of CFCFA strengthened. The TA will support design \nand initial implementation of a comprehensive business model for self-sustainability, including \neffective mobilization of member resources, and coordination of training opportunities amongst \nmembers, to help the CFCFA transition to a fully independent self-governing body by 2021. It will \nalso support supplementary institutional strengthening and capacity building of the CFCFA to help \nit  develop  further  as  an  effective  autonomous  mechanism  to  improve  transport  and  trade \nfacilitation. The TA will help design training and reference materials in foreign trade development, \nexport or logistics for future practitioners to maintain and sustain sharing of knowledge and best \npractice among CFCFA members.19 Training activities will be conducted in collaboration with the \nCAREC Institute, the International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations, the ADB \nRegional Knowledge Sharing Initiative, and relevant international agencies.20 \n \n11.  Output 3: Sustainable institutional arrangement for CPMM implemented. The TA will \nhelp expand CPMM data gathering coverage to include trade logistics services and levels of \ncompliance. Improved understanding of how logistics services are provided to the private sector \nand other stakeholders will contribute to valuable inputs for policy formulation and action. The \nenhanced CPMM will identify necessary complementarities in the regulations, procedures, and \nsoft and hard infrastructure required among transit nations to improve efficiencies in transporting \ngoods along the corridors and across borders. Results will be published in CPMM annual reports. \nBased on 10 years of CPMM data, a flagship report will be prepared to (i) identify progress in \ntrade facilitation measures in the CAREC region, through analysis of trends in time, cost, and \ndistance indicators; and (ii) provide policy recommendations. An electronic interface will be \ndeveloped for the CPMM database to provide public access to CPMM data. ADB and the CAREC \nInstitute will form a partnership to produce flagship knowledge products, based on CPMM data. \nA CPMM roadmap will be prepared to facilitate the transition of CPMM data gathering and \nmanagement to the CAREC Institute, to ensure wider dissemination, use, and application of \nCPMM data; and CPMM annual reports will be prepared jointly by ADB and the CAREC Institute. \n \n12.  TA outputs will be disseminated electronically to public and private sector stakeholders, \nthrough the ADB and CAREC websites, and as CAREC conference and workshop materials. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.21 The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. The Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund will finance operational expenses \nsuch as consulting services and related goods and activities; it will not be used to finance (i) civil \nworks, (ii) procurement of large-scale equipment, or (iii) permanent staffing costs. \n \n19  Training curriculum will complement and update the training provided to CFCFA members supported by ADB TA \n7353 and 6437 to adopt industry best practice and promote wider application among member associations. \n20  ADB\u2013PRC Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative.
