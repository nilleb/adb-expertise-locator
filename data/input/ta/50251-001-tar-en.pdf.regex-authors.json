INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  regional  connectivity  in \nSoutheast Asia mainly through three subregional cooperation programs: (i) the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  Economic  Cooperation  Program,  (ii)  the  Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand \nGrowth  Triangle  (IMT-GT),  and  (iii)  the  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines \nEast ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA).1 All three programs have prioritized trade facilitation \nas an important means to enhance regional connectivity and the use of physical linkages. \n \n2.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to  support  the  customs  administrations  of \nparticipating ADB member countries to better implement the various Association of Southeast \nAsian  Nations  (ASEAN)  trade  facilitation  initiatives.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment agenda on regional integration under the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and \nwill build on previous and ongoing ADB support for transport and trade facilitation in Southeast \nAsia.2 ADB held a regional time release study (TRS) conference in Tokyo on 6\u20138 October 2015, \nwhere TRS recommendations were shared with countries participating in the conference. The \nTokyo conference also reaffirmed the countries\u2019 strong interest in and demand for this proposed \nTA.3 \n \n3.  ADB approved the TA concept in October 2016 and fielded a mission to Tokyo, Japan, \nin October 2015. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Countries have made significant progress in lowering trade tariffs and dismantling quota \nsystems.  International  trade  has  increased,  with  manufacturing  becoming more global  and \neconomies connected to international supply and value chains through both their exports and \nimports.  As  trade  liberalization  lowers  tariff  barriers  in  Southeast  Asia,  trade  facilitation  is \nincreasingly  recognized  as  an  important  policy  tool  to  promote  regional  integration  and \ndevelopment. Governments realize that their economies depend heavily on efficient export and \nimport processing, and that they thus need to adopt a holistic approach to making management \nof end-to-end trade transactions more efficient, and thereby enhancing administrative efficiency \nand effectiveness, reducing cost and time to markets, and increasing the predictability of global \ntrade. Trade facilitation also assumes particular significance in the context of building a well-\nconnected ASEAN Economic Community in Southeast Asia. \n \n5.  Countries face challenges that include lack of transparency about rules and regulations, \nredundant and lengthy clearance processes, and complicated document requirements (e.g., \nwith different formats and data elements). It is equally important to focus on trade and regulatory \nprocesses conducted at the border to ensure they are optimized and that the time required for \ntrade-related procedures is reduced where appropriate. Activities related to calculating and \nrecording the time needed by customs to release goods can provide pertinent information to \nguide necessary process improvements and identify desirable regulatory changes to ensure the \neffective facilitation of trade. \n                                                \n1  ADB.

Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n3  Categorized as knowledge and support technical assistance under the new staff instructions effective 13 March \n2017. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 July 2016. \n ", "2 \n6.  The TRS is a tool for collecting and assessing data, and can help highlight areas that \nneed  to  be  addressed  to  reduce  or  eliminate  bottlenecks,  and  to  assess  progress  in \nimplementing modernization programs. In 2014, the World Trade Organization (WTO) opened \nits  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement  for  ratification  and  encouraged  members  to  periodically \nmeasure and publish average release times for goods in a consistent manner, using tools such \nas the TRS.5 \n \n7.  ADB promotes trade facilitation in Southeast Asia through (i) coordination with customs-\nrelated  trade  facilitation  efforts  of  other  development  partners;  (ii)  customization  of  trade \nfacilitation efforts for countries using ADB\u2019s experience as a secretariat and advisory body for \nsubregional groupings\u2014such as the GMS, BIMP-EAGA, and IMT-GT\u2014to strengthen regional \nconnectivity,  and  support  establishment  of  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community;  and  (iii) \nconsolidation  with  non-customs-related  trade  facilitation,  which  may  affect  overall  trade \nfacilitation  performance  in  Southeast  Asia.  ADB  has  also  prepared  dedicated  programs  to \nsupport developing member countries through TA focusing on customs and other trade-related \ngovernment agency priorities to promote the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025, \nwhich envisions a highly integrated and cohesive economy by accelerating and deepening the \nimplementation of trade facilitation measures.6 \n \n8.  In 2011, the Japan launched the Asia Cargo Highway (ACH), a trade facilitation initiative \ninvolving four institutions: (i) ADB; (ii) the Customs and Tariff Bureau in Japan\u2019s Ministry of \nFinance, (iii) JICA; and (iv) the WCO. The objective of the ACH is to promote the seamless flow \nof goods within and outside Asia. Under the initiative, the four institutions provide coordinated \nassistance for customs administration in Asia. The ASEAN directors general and commissioners \nof  customs  administration  fully  endorsed  the  initiative  at  the  ASEAN\u2013Japan  Directors-\nGeneral/Commissioners Customs Meeting on Trade Facilitation in April 2011. \n \n9.  Under  the  ACH,  ADB  implemented  TA  for  Trade  Facilitation  Support  for  ASEAN \nEconomic  Community  Blueprint  Implementation  from  2012  to  2015.7 The  TA  supported \nconducting  TRSs  in  ASEAN  member  countries.  The  participating  countries  gained \nunderstanding of the TRS as a planning tool for identifying bottlenecks in customs operations, \nwhile  initial  recommendations  of  the  TRS  country  reports  guided  countries  in  undertaking \ncustoms reform and modernization. \n \n10.  The TRSs collected checkpoint-specific data to help identify the causes of bottlenecks. \nCountries that have conducted multiple TRSs have benchmark data to address weaknesses.8 \nThrough the TA country officials (i) became familiar with the methodology used to collect data \nused in the findings, (ii) became skilled in data collection and its use in identifying bottlenecks, \nand (iii) gained understanding of how to apply the theoretical model in a practical manner to \ngain the knowledge necessary to conduct trade facilitation TRSs. \n \n                                                \n5  WCO.

Technical Assistance for Trade Facilitation Support for ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint \nImplementation (Greater Mekong Subregion/Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle). Manila (TA 8079-\nREG). ADB implemented related small-scale TA\u2014Trade Facilitation Support for ASEAN Economic Community \nBlueprint Implementation (Myanmar)\u2014in 2013. \n8  As of October 2016, countries have conducted the following number of TRSs: Cambodia (one), Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (two), Malaysia (six), Myanmar (one), Thailand (five), and Viet Nam (two), (2015. Asian \nDevelopment Bank. Compendium of Country Time Release Study Reports. Manila). \n ", "3 \n11.  ADB completed the TA in October 2015. The Tokyo conference provided an opportunity \nfor participating countries to share the experiences, key findings, and recommendations that \nemerged from the country and regional TRS reports supported by the TA; and exchange views \non issues for future TRSs in Southeast Asia. The Tokyo conference helped the countries \nprepare an action plan that summarized common key issues identified in the individual action \nplans of the country reports. The action plan also identified the following priority actions for each \ncountry to better facilitate trade: (i) implement recommendations derived from previous TRSs, \n(ii) conduct new TRSs, and (iii) strengthen TRS implementation strategy. \n \n12.  The proposed TA will assist participating countries to undertake specific customs reform \nand modernization steps, using TRS-collected data, that support substantive trade facilitation \nmeasures based on the action plan, and to conduct a study of their checkpoints to initiate \nimprovements in dealing with the bottlenecks. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced trade facilitation in Southeast Asia in terms of \nefficiency of border procedures. The TA outcome will be improved trade facilitation regimes in \nparticipating ASEAN member countries, and will be measured by the implementation of the \nTokyo action plan. ADB will implement all TA outputs in Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  and  Viet  Nam;  output  2  may  also  include  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and \nThailand. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The outcome will be achieved by the delivery of three main outputs, which are the \npriority actions of the Tokyo action plan: (i) TRS recommendations implemented, (ii) new TRSs \nconducted, and (iii) TRS implementation strategy strengthened. \n \n15.  Output 1: Time release study recommendations implemented. The TA will conduct \ncapacity-building activities to implement the following Tokyo action plan recommendations: \n(i)  Ensure legislation complies with the latest international standards. The TA \nwill review legislation in each participating country to ensure compliance with the \nlatest  international  standards. 9  Legislative  revisions  can  be  essential  to \nimplement the changes required to reduce bottlenecks. \n(ii)  Provide strategies to develop or enhance customs information technology \nsystems and a national single window. The TA will provide strategic support to \ndevelop  customs  information  technology  (IT)  systems  and  a  national  single \nwindow.10 Customs and other government agencies (OGAs) should agree on a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  to  work  together  to  streamline  operations, \n                                                \n9  Legislation refers to the relevant rules for cross-border control under jurisdiction of the countries\u2019 customs and \nother government agencies, including laws, regulations, procedures, and processes. Activities under output 1 will \nidentify the specific legislation that needs to be considered. \n10 Coordinated border management is a \u201ccoordinated approach by border control agencies, both domestic and \ninternational, in the context of seeking greater efficiencies over managing trade and travel flows, while maintaining \na balance with compliance requirements\u201d (S. Aniszewski. 2009. Coordinated Border Management\u2014A Concept \nPaper. WCO Research Paper. No. 2. WCO: Brussels. p. 6). Participating countries have based their IT systems \nprimarily on the United Nations\u2019 Automated System for Customs Data or Japan\u2019s Nippon Automated Cargo and \nPort Consolidated System \n ", "4 \ncoordinate  assessments  with  the  aim  of  reducing  checkpoint  delays,  and \ncontinue discussing issues of mutual interest. OGAs should be represented in \nfuture TRSs. \n(iii)  Check operations against international standards. The TA will help share the \nfindings  of  this  TRS  with  international  partners  that  conduct  modernization \nprograms and implement customs modernization initiatives. Using the TRS data \nas a baseline, the TA will check current operations against international (WTO \nand WCO) standards in support of a modernization program in each participating \ncountry that addresses its specific capacity-building needs.11 \n(iv)  Design an intelligence and compliance management strategy to align the \nrisk  management  processes.  The  TA  will  design  a  strategy  to  implement \ncompliance  and/or  risk  management,  intelligence,  and  supply  chain  security \nprograms,  supported  by  extensive  capacity  building  for  border  staff.  Each \nparticipating country will upgrade their IT system with risk management modules \ndesigned to help reduce bottlenecks at borders.12 \n(v)  Review and improve processes and procedures at checkpoints. The TA will \nreview and update current and outdated processes and procedures to ensure \ncompliance with the latest international standards required for customs and other \nborder  agencies. 13  Using  the  TRS  as  a  baseline,  many  processes  and \nprocedures  could  be  analyzed  using  the  business  processes  reengineering \nmethodology.  This  will  strengthen  and  deepen  country  report  findings  and \nrecommendations,  and  facilitate  data  collection  and  analysis  to  improve \nperformance at the checkpoints. \n \n16.  Output 2: New time release studies conducted. Participating countries will conduct \nfollow-up TRSs to ensure TRS recommendations are implemented. The TA will support these \ncountries in conducting follow-up TRSs and national workshops. Baseline data can be used to \nassess the impact of current actions on dealing with bottlenecks. \n \n17.  Output 3: Time release study implementation strategy strengthened. The TA will \nsupport to strengthen the capacity of a Trade Facilitation Implementation Committee comprising \nrepresentatives of customs, OGAs, and key private sector stakeholders. Participating countries \nwill  partner  with  these  key  stakeholders  to  develop  a  TRS  plan  and  to  monitor  its \nimplementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will implement the TA from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2020 and will be the executing \nagency. ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department will administer the TA. ADB will work closely with \n                                                \n11 International standards particularly refer to the WCO customs modernization programs to enhance the smooth flow \nof trade, such as the SAFE Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade. \n12 A key feature of the compliance management approach is the ability to direct the client population toward low-risk \nvoluntary compliance, which allows scarce control resources to be deployed toward the high-risk end of the risk \ncontinuum (WCO. 2011. WCO Customs Risk Management Compendium: Volume 1. Geneva). \n13 Policies and procedures refer to actual and/or daily operations at those checkpoints. \n ", "5 \ncustoms  administration  agencies  in  ASEAN  member  countries,  which  will  serve  as  the \nimplementing agencies.14 It will maintain close coordination and collaboration with institutions \nthat  support  Japan\u2019s  trade facilitation  initiative\u2014the  Customs  and Tariff  Bureau  in  Japan\u2019s \nMinistry of Finance, JICA, and the WCO\u2014during TA implementation. ADB will request customs \nadministration agencies and OGAs in the participating countries to send designated officers to \nworkshops that will be organized under the TA. \n \n20.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  coordination  with  ADB-supported  trade  facilitation \ninitiatives to support customs and other trade-related government agencies in Southeast Asia.15 \n \n21.  The TA will require 76 person-months of consulting services, comprising 28 person-\nmonths of international consultants and 48 person-months of national consultants. ADB will \nengage (i) one resource person per workshop; (ii) a team leader to draft initial work plans for \ntrade facilitation and organize capacity-building activities for customs administration; (iii) TRS \nand coordinated border management specialists to undertake TRS-related activities and support \nthe team leader; (iv) resource persons to provide expert views (e.g., on issues such as the use \nof a national single window); (v) four country specialists assess knowledge gaps and constraints \nfor strengthening customs capacity for trade in each country; and (vi) a project administrator. \nADB will engage the consultants on an individual basis following the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants is in Appendix 3. ADB will disburse TA proceeds following the Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010 as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  ADB will report TA progress to the countries through national meetings held under the \nTA. The major activities, good practices, and lessons from TA implementation will be made \navailable on ADB websites and circulated as necessary.16 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Advancing Time Release Studies in \nSoutheast Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14 General Department of Customs and Excise, Cambodia; Customs Department, Indonesia; Directorate General of \nCustoms  and  Excise,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic;  Royal  Malaysian  Customs Department,  Malaysia; \nCustoms Department, Myanmar; Customs Department, Thailand; and General Department of Viet Nam Customs, \nViet Nam. \n15 These include ADB. 2014.
