An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment  undertaken. The summary environmental impact assessment was \ncirculated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and posted on the ADB website on 26 September 2008.  \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  aims  to  improve  urban  road  infrastructure,  traffic \nmanagement  and  safety,  and  environmental  sanitation  in  the \nfollowing  cities  of  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region \n(Xinjiang): Altay, Changji, Hami, Kuytun, and Turpan. The Project \nconsists  of  five  components  that  seek  to  improve  urban  living \nconditions  and  public  health,  and  protect  the  environment  by \nupgrading and extending roads and sanitation infrastructure in the \nproject cities. Based on specific transport conditions of the project \ncities, the Project will (i) construct 37.4 kilometers (km) of new \nroads  and  upgrade  70.5  km  of  existing  roads;  (ii)  install  traffic \nsignal systems, bus stops and bays, road furniture including road \nbarriers,  pedestrian  crossings,  signage,  and  marking;  and  (iii) \nconstruct  and  install  environmental  sanitation  facilities  such  as \npublic toilets, garbage collection stations, trash cans, as well as \nprovide solid waste management equipment.   \n   \nRationale  ADB  has  been  actively  supporting  the  PRC\u2019s  Western  Region \nDevelopment Strategy, which aims to spur economic development \nof the Western Region of the PRC including Xinjiang, by providing \ntechnical  assistance  and  financial  resources  to  improve  urban \ninfrastructure (transportation, communications, power, and water \nresources)  and  support  inclusive  economic  growth.  The  main \npillars  of  the  strategy  are  investments  in  urban  infrastructure, \npreservation of the environment, and attraction of private sector \ninvestments in the region\u2019s economy. The Project will complement \nother ADB-financed projects aimed at improving infrastructure and \nenvironment in the region. \n \n ", "ii   \nThe Project, which covers the fast growing cities of Altay, Changji, \nHami, Kuytun, and Turpan, is designed to (i) improve the urban \nroad  infrastructure  and  achieve  the  environmental  objectives \napproved in the city master plans and 11th Five-Year Plan 2006\u2013\n2010, (ii) facilitate access to environmental sanitation facilities and \nenable their proper functioning, (iii) improve air quality and reduce \ndust pollution caused by poor surface road conditions, (iv) improve \nroad safety and reduce traffic delay, (v) improve environmental \nhygiene and public health through the construction of sanitation \ninfrastructure and provision of environmental sanitation equipment, \n(vi)  introduce  environmental  management  in  urban  downtown \nareas  and  expanding  urban  areas,  and  (vii)  catalyze  economic \ngrowth and improve poor people\u2019s well-being.  \n \nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Urban Sector Strategy (1999), \nwhich  supports  investments  in  the  urban  sector  as  a  dynamic \nengine of economic growth and employment creation, innovation, \nand entrepreneurship. The Project also supports ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for the PRC to strengthen inclusive growth, \nimprove  the  environment,  catalyze  investments,  and  improve \ngovernance. The Project complements the ADB-financed Xinjiang \nMunicipal Infrastructure and Environmental Improvement Project, \nwhich aims to improve road infrastructure and utility services in \nAlashankou  land port, Kanas  scenic  region,  and  Yining City  of \nXinjiang. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is sustainable socioeconomic growth and \nimproved living standards in five cities of Xinjiang.

The major ethnic \ngroup  is  the  Uygur,  constituting  45.9%  of  the  total  population. \nOther  significant  ethnic  minority  groups  include  the  Kazakh \nconstituting 6.9% of the total population and the Hui constituting \n4.4%. Of the five cities, Turpan has the highest percentage of \nethnic minorities (78%), followed by Altay (39%), Changji (28%), \nand  Kuytun  (5%).  According  to  the  socioeconomic  survey \nundertaken during project preparation, the urban poverty rate is \nabout 27% in Altay, 10.9% in Changji, 17.4% in Hami, 8.5% in \nKuytun, and 12.2% in Turpan. Average per capita incomes are \nCNY1,332  per  annum  ($0.52  per  day)  in  Altay,  CNY1,493 \n($0.58 per day) in Changji, CNY1,116 ($0.44 per day) in Hami, \nCNY1,000 ($0.39 per day) in Kuytun, and CNY918 ($0.36 per day) \nin Turpan.  \n \nThe project beneficiaries will be the residents in the five project \ncities, including the ethnic minorities and the poor. The Project is \nexpected  to  entail  the  following  benefits:  (i)  generation  of \nemployment  opportunities  directly  and  indirectly  related  to  the \nProject; (ii) improved living standards in the project cities because \nof the upgraded and newly constructed roads and facilitation of \ngreater mobility, access, and affordability of key basic services and \ndestinations  for  the  local  population;  (iii)  improved  urban  road \nsafety and reduced incidence of traffic accidents; and (iv) improved \nenvironment  and  public  health  associated  with  the  provision  of \npublic  toilets  and  bathrooms,  and  sustainable  solid  waste \nmanagement practices. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The main project risks include (i) timely provision of counterpart \nfunding; (ii) low institutional capacity in terms of project technical, \nfinancial,  and  environmental  management;  and  (iii)  timely \nconstruction  of  project  infrastructure  because  of  the  short \nconstruction  period.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  through  the \nfollowing  measures:  (i)  comprehensive  capital  budgeting  and \nsecuring a formal commitment from the project city governments \nand loan assurances regarding adequate and timely allocation of \ncounterpart  funds  in  the  city  budgets  during  the  project \nimplementation  period;  (ii)  provision  of  extensive  training  in \ninfrastructure  project  technical,  financial,  and  environmental \nmanagement under the Project; (iii) selection of qualified project \nimplementation consultants; (iv) installation of appropriate project \nimplementation  monitoring  and  mitigation  arrangements;  and \n(v) active project management assistance from the ADB project \nteam. \n   \n ", "78 o 00'E RUSSIAN 93 o 00'E\nFEDERATION\nXINJIANG URBAN TRANSPORT AND\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT\nIN THE Hom Hanas\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Altay\nM O N G O L I A\nTacheng\nProject City/Town\n46 o 00'N Provincial Capital K A Z A K H S T A N Tabeshika 46 o 00'N\nAlataw\nCity/Town Shankou\nKaramay\nNational Road Druzba\nOther Road Bole\nRailway Changji\nRiver Yining Kuytun\nUrumqi\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary Hami\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nTurpan\nKYRGYZ   REPUBLIC\nKuqa\nKorla\nAksu\nGANSU\nArtux\nXINJIANG UYGUR\nKashi Bachu AUTONOMOUS REGION\nTAJIKISTAN\n38 o 00'N 38 o 00'N\nQINGHAI\nHotan\nAFGHANISTAN\nN\n0 50 100 150 200 250\nKilometers\nXIZANG\n0\n8\n-4\n1\n99 H 78 o 00'E 93 o 00'E\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Xinjiang Urban Transport and Environmental \nImprovement Project. \n \n2.  The Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help improve and \nexpand urban transport and sanitation infrastructure, and the environment in the cities of Altay, \nChangji, Hami, Kuytun, and Turpan in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). The report \nis based on the results of the loan appraisal mission, as well as discussions with the central and \nlocal governments and community organizations. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. The problems and objectives tree analyses are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  The PRC economy has experienced robust economic growth during the last decade. \nAnnual gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated from 10.1% in 2004 to 13.0% in 2007 \nand eased to 9.0% in 2008. GDP per capita in current market prices reached $3,308.1 in 2008.1 \nEconomic  growth  has  been  accompanied  by  rapid  urbanization,  with  the  country\u2019s  urban \npopulation reaching about 577 million. According to World Bank estimates, urbanization in the \nPRC can pass the 60% mark by 2020, with 200 million or more rural people joining the urban \npopulation.2 Growth in personal incomes has resulted in increased vehicle ownership, which \nwithin a 10-year period doubled to 28.12 vehicles per 1,000 people nationwide, and is likely to \ncontinue increasing rapidly in the future. Rapid growth in vehicles and passenger transport has \nput increasing pressure on the urban road network and environment.  \n \n4.  Rapid urbanization and industrialization have had a high environmental cost. Many cities \nface environmental threats from pollution. The growing urban population, industrialization, and \neconomic development will continue to increase demand for infrastructure services such as \nroads and associated environmental sanitation infrastructure, and call for increased investments \nin urban infrastructure, transport planning, and improved road and traffic management. In the \nPRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP) 2006\u20132010, the Government has emphasized inclusive \nand balanced economic development as a key strategic priority and has prioritized addressing \nenvironmental  protection  and  pollution  control  issues  through  policy  reform,  increased \ninvestment, and improved urban infrastructure management as pillars of sustainable economic \ngrowth. The sector analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  Located in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent, Xinjiang shares borders with eight \ncountries and covers about 1.7 million square kilometers (km2), about one-sixth of the total area \nof the PRC. 3 In 2007, its population was about 20.5 million (about 1.5% of the population of the \nPRC), comprising 40% Han Chinese and 60% of other ethnic groups, the largest of which is the \nUygur. Xinjiang has lagged behind other regions of the PRC in terms of economic growth and \npoverty reduction. Despite the abundance of natural resources, Xinjiang remains one of the \n                                                 \n1  ADB estimates and ADB. 2008. Key Indicators for the Asia and Pacific 2008. Manila. \n2  World Bank. 2008. China Urbanizes. Washington, DC. \n3  Xinjiang shares borders with Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russian \nFederation, and Tajikistan. ", "2 \npoorest provinces of the country. In 2007, about 8% of its urban population and 12% of its rural \npopulation  lived  below  the  official  poverty  line,  compared  with  a  national  average  poverty \nincidence of 3.7% among the urban population and 2.3% among the rural population. In 2007, \nthe per capita disposable income of urban households in Xinjiang was CNY8,871 ($1,267), \nwhich was the lowest of all the PRC provinces.4  \n \n6.  To spur economic growth of the Western Region, including Xinjiang, the Government \nlaunched the National Strategy for Development of the West that aims to stimulate economic \ndevelopment and raise the living standard of the population.5 In November 2008, to arrest the \nongoing economic slowdown, the Government launched a substantial fiscal stimulus package \nequivalent to 16% of the 2007 nominal GDP that largely focused on infrastructure development.6 \nAs a result of the ongoing economic development, Xinjiang has experienced rapid urbanization. \nIn 2006, the urban population in Xinjiang at 7.78 million accounted for 38% of the population; it \nis expected to increase to 42% by 2010 and further to 47% by 2015. The increasing urban \npopulation, industrialization, and economic development will continue to increase the demand \nfor urban infrastructure services such as roads and solid waste management. From 1995 to \n2007, the length of paved roads in urban areas increased by about 68% from 2,403 km to 4,044 \nkm, and the area of paved roads increased by 150% from 26 km2 to 65 km2. Private vehicle \nownership in Xinjiang increased from 14.9 to 35.0 vehicles per 1,000 people during the same \nperiod. The urban transport and road network are the main mode of transportation in the cities. \nRapid growth in vehicles and passenger transport have put increasing pressure on the road \nnetwork and capacity expansion.  \n \n7.  Growing urbanization and passenger transportation have resulted in increased disposal \nof  waste,  including  solid  waste.  Uncollected  and  untreated  solid  waste  cause  significant \nenvironmental threats for the urban areas. In 2007, about 2.78 million tons of municipal solid \nwaste were collected and disposed of in the region but only 51% of this was disposed of at \nsanitary landfill sites. Meanwhile, 655 million tons of wastewater were discharged, where 69% \ncame from municipal sources and 31% from industrial sources. For municipal wastewater, only \nabout 60% was collected and treated in the cities and towns in 2007. Considerable investments \nare needed to construct environmental sanitation facilities such as public toilets, solid waste \ncollection, and processing facilities. \n \n8.  Improvement of the urban environment in the cities of Xinjiang\u2014by reducing air and \nnoise pollution, improving solid waste management, and strengthening environmental protection \nand  management\u2014is  crucial  to  achieving  and  sustaining  their  development  objectives.  An \nefficient, safe, and environmentally sustainable road network, together with improved sanitation \ninfrastructure,  is  important  to  raise  the  living  standards  of  the  poor  and  to  cope  with  the \nincreasing demand for municipal services resulting from economic growth and urbanization. \nTransport planning, improved road and traffic management, and vehicular emission control are \nkey areas in the Government\u2019s policy to ensure sustainable development while protecting the \nenvironment.  Unlike  the  PRC\u2019s  coastal  cities,  where  rapid  growth  has  entailed  serious \nenvironmental problems, Xinjiang still has better opportunities to avoid negative environmental \nexternalities  of  rapid  economic  growth  and  achieve  sustainable  development  through  this \nProject and other future initiatives.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 2007.

Project Rationale. The main pillars of the Western Region Development Strategy are \ninvestments in urban infrastructure, preservation of the environment, and attracting private \nsector investments in the region\u2019s economy. ADB has been actively supporting the strategy by \nproviding  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  financial  resources  aimed  at  improving  urban \ninfrastructure (transportation, communications, power, and water resources) and supporting \ninclusive economic growth.7 The Project will complement other ADB-financed projects aimed at \nimproving infrastructure and the environment in the region.8  \n \n10.  The Project, which covers the fast-growing cities of Altay, Changji, Hami, Kuytun, and \nTurpan, is designed to (i) improve the urban road infrastructure and achieve the environmental \nobjectives approved in the city master plans and 11FYP; (ii) facilitate access to environmental \nsanitation facilities and enable their proper functioning; (iii) improve air quality and reduce dust \npollution caused by poor surface road conditions; (iv) improve the safety and comfort of road \nusers, including pedestrians and drivers, and reduce traffic delay; (v) improve environmental \nhygiene and public health through the provision of environmental sanitation equipment and \nfacilities; (vi) introduce environmental management in urban downtown areas and expanding \nurban areas; and (vii) catalyze economic growth and improve poor people\u2019s well-being.  \n \n11.  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy, which supports investments \nin  the  urban  sector,  as  a  dynamic  engine  of  economic  growth  and  employment  creation, \ninnovation, and entrepreneurship; and supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC \nto strengthen inclusive growth, improve the environment, catalyze investments, and improve \ngovernance.9 The proposed Project is an integral part of the provincial urban development \nmaster plan. The first ADB Project that follows the master plan is the ongoing Xinjiang Municipal \nInfrastructure and Environmental Improvement Project, which focuses on improving the road \ninfrastructure and utility services in Alashankou land port, Kansas scenic region, and Yining City \nof Xinjiang.10 \n \n12.  Policy  Dialogue. The Project will build on ADB\u2019s policy dialogue on (i) sustainable \neconomic  growth  and  environmental  management,  (ii)  integrated  urban  transport  planning, \n(iii) effective traffic management and road safety, (iv) institutional development of the Project\u2019s \nexecuting agency (EA) and implementing agencies (IAs), and (v) social and poverty aspects. \n \n13.  The  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  government  (XUARG)  recognizes  that  to \nachieve long-term sustainable growth there is a need to balance economic development and \nenvironmental concerns. The Project will introduce measures to prevent and control pollution \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2005.

Sustainable transport planning and policy reforms are crucial to ensure that the Project \ncreates  economic  value  added  and  the  benefits  are  passed  on  to  the  road  users.  Urban \ntransport planning must take into consideration the linkages among land use, accessibility, \ntransport  services,  social  and  poverty  aspects,  road  accidents,  road  maintenance,  and \ninteragency coordination and cooperation. The master plan for each of the project cities is being \nupdated  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  growing  economy.  The  Xinjiang  and  the  project  city \ngovernments  recognize  that  integration  of  urban  and  transport  planning  is  important.  The \nProject will assist local city authorities in strengthening their capacity to update and improve \nurban development and transport master planning. \n \n15.  Traffic management issues include the increased number and severity of road accidents, \nconflict  between  pedestrians  and  motorists,  nonmotorized  transport  operations,  and  public \ntransport efficiency. Road safety problems are serious in the PRC and are mainly caused by \ninsufficient  road  network  and  inefficient  traffic  management.  Poor  traffic  management  also \ncauses  health,  environmental,  and  social  consequences  that  negatively  affect  national \neconomic growth. The Project will introduce an appropriate road safety strategy in the project \ncities. This includes traffic engineering considerations in road design, focusing on existing major \naccident black spots, traffic management focusing on signage and appropriate use of traffic \nsignal  control  systems,  increasing  community  and  industry  awareness  in  road  safety,  and \ndissemination of road safety knowledge. Reduction of the frequency, severity, and cost of road \naccidents will particularly benefit low-income people including pedestrians, public bus users, \nand bicycle riders; and increase the economic benefits of the investment. The Project will \nimprove road surfaces and introduce traffic management measures to ensure efficient energy \nconsumption by vehicles and minimize pollution to the environment.  \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s urban infrastructure projects emphasize the importance of capacity building to \nenhance organizational capability to ensure that (i) the project components are designed and \nconstructed in a cost-effective manner and are implemented in compliance with environmental \nand social safeguards, (ii) operation and maintenance (O&M) procedures are in place to enable \nthe completed facilities to perform efficiently, (iii) adequate funding mechanism is established for \neffective O&M so that project benefits can be sustained in the long term, and (iv) there is overall \nenhancement of organizational performance in the delivery of municipal and environmental \nprotection services. Institutional development is an important part of the Project because (i) the \nproject cities have no experience in implementing ADB-financed projects, and (ii) the Project \ninvolves  a  variety  of  works  in  geographically  dispersed  locations  involving  many  levels  of \npersonnel.   \n \n17.  From a social and poverty perspective, policy dialogue is necessary in a number of \nareas: (i) the nature of demand-driven urban development improvements; (ii) approaches to \nurban  development  that  are  pro-poor  and  sensitive  to  gender  and  ethnic  minorities;  and \n(iii) improvements  in  urban  infrastructure  and  landscapes.  These  have  been  taken  into \nconsideration  in  the  project  design.  Details  of  the  policy  dialogue  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B.  \n \n18.  External Assistance. Since 1992, ADB has provided more than 39 loans totaling nearly \n$4.9 billion to the PRC for urban infrastructure and environmental improvement projects. ADB \nhas also provided over $69 million for more than 100 TA studies to prepare these projects and \nto  review  and  study  key  issues  in  urban  infrastructure,  environmental  improvement,  and \n ", "5 \npollution control. ADB is also providing a number of TA projects to the Government on Western \nRegion development to facilitate regional cooperation with Central Asia. External assistance to \nXinjiang for implementing its urban transport and environmental improvement projects has been \nprovided by the World Bank (Tarim Basin Water Conservancy and Agriculture Support, Kuytun \nto  Syimlake  Expressway,  and  Urumqi  Urban  Transportation  Improvement);  Government  of \nJapan (Xinjiang Cities Integrated Environment Management, Urumqi Hetan Road, and Yining \nCity Integrated Environment Management); Government of the Republic of Korea (Korla Outer \nRing Road); and several European governments. The details of external assistance are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n19.  Lessons Learned. Lessons from urban transport projects financed by ADB and other \ninternational  financial  institutions  include  the  (i)  benefits  of  a  participatory  approach  and \nmultiagency coordination during project preparation; (ii) efficiently planned and well-coordinated \nresettlement  planning  preceded  by  adequate  consultation  with  affected  parties;  and \n(iii) importance  of  public  transport  and  traffic  management,  including  aspects  of  traffic \nforecasting, road safety, vehicle emission control, and road maintenance. These lessons have \nbeen considered in the project design. \n \n20.  To ensure timely implementation of the Project and to minimize delays caused by a short \nconstruction season, it is important to (i) factor in a shorter construction period typical for the \nXinjiang climate; and (ii) undertake advanced actions within the frames of retroactive financing \nallowed by ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). To avoid \npotential delays in the project procurement process, emphasis needs to be put on (i) strict \nadherence to ADB\u2019s mandatory bidding documents, (ii) efficient bid evaluation in accordance \nwith ADB-approved evaluation criteria, and (iii) clear substantiation of bid evaluations.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n21.  The impact of the Project is sustainable socioeconomic growth and improved living \nstandards  in  five  cities  of  Xinjiang.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  urban  road \ninfrastructure, traffic management, and environmental sanitation in the cities of Altay, Changji, \nHami, Kuytun, and Turpan.   \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n22.  The  Project  has  five  physical  components:  (i)  Altay  Roads  and  Environmental \nImprovement,  (ii)  Changji  Roads  and  Environmental  Improvement,  (iii)  Hami  Roads  and \nEnvironmental  Improvement,  (iv)  Kuytun  Roads  and  Environmental  Improvement,  and \n(v) Turpan Roads and Environmental Improvement. Based on specific transport conditions of \nthe project cities, the Project will (i) construct 37.4 km of new roads and upgrade 70.5 km of \nexisting roads; (ii) install traffic signal system, bus stops and bays, and road furniture, including \nroad barriers, pedestrian crossings, signage, marking, and green separators; and (iii) construct \nand install environmental sanitation facilities such as public toilets, garbage collection stations, \ntrash cans, as well as provide street sweeper trucks. A summary of the five components, which \nare  further  broken  down  into  10  subcomponents,  is  in  Table  1.  Technical  analysis  of  the \ncomponents is in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n \n \n ", "6 \nTable 1: Summary Description of the Project Components and Subcomponents \nComponent  Subcomponent  Description \n Altay Roads   Roads   Construct/upgrade  19  municipal  roads  with  a  total  length  of \nand  28.02 km, including construction of 3 new roads, and upgrading \nEnvironmental  of  16  existing  roads;  construct  5  new  bridges;  construct \nImprovement  associated  road  facilities;  and  purchase  road  maintenance \nequipment. \nEnvironmental   Construct 10 public toilets and 20 garbage collection stations; \nImprovement  install  654  trash  cans  and  102  refuse  collection  points;  and \npurchase 1 garbage compaction truck, 1 rear loader garbage \ntruck, 1 street sweeper truck, 2 snow removing trucks, 1 grapple \ngarbage truck, 1 excavator, 1 wheel loader, and 2 dump trucks.  \n     \nChangji Roads  Roads   Construct 9 new municipal roads with a total length of 23.24 km, \nand  including  1  bridge;  construct  associated  road  facilities;  and \nEnvironmental   purchase road maintenance equipment. \nImprovement  Environmental  Construct  8  public  toilets  and  8  garbage  collection  stations; \nImprovement   install  394  trash  cans  and  33  refuse  collection  points;  and \npurchase  5  garbage  compaction  trucks,  5  garbage  trucks, \n4 street sweeper trucks, 2 snow removing trucks, 1 wheeled \nexcavator, 1 aerial work vehicle, 1 crane, 1 tip truck, 1 sprinkling \nvehicle, and 1 pesticide spraying vehicle.  \n     \nHami Roads and  Roads  Upgrade  3  municipal  roads,  with  a  total  length  of  9.02  km; \nEnvironmental  construct  3  culverts;  construct  associated  road  facilities;  and \nImprovement   purchase road maintenance equipment. \nEnvironmental  Install 182 trash cans and purchase 2 street sweeper trucks and \nImprovement   1 street cleaning truck.  \n     \nKuytun Roads  Roads  Upgrade 13 municipal roads, with a total length of 23.6 km, \nand  including 2 trunk roads, 2 secondary roads, 9 branch roads, and \nEnvironmental  construct  2  bridges;  construct  associated  road  facilities;  and \nImprovement   purchase road maintenance equipment. \nEnvironmental  Construct 11 public toilets and 21 garbage collection stations; \nImprovement   install  480  trash  cans,  105  garbage  containers,  and  3  rest \nstations for environmental sanitation workers; and purchase 4 \ngarbage compaction trucks, 2 street sweeper trucks, 2 snow \nremoving trucks, and 2 sprinkling vehicles.  \n     \nTurpan Roads  Roads  Construct/upgrade  14  municipal  roads,  with  a  total  length  of \nand  22.76  km,  including  5  trunk  roads,  7  secondary  roads,  and \nEnvironmental  2 branch roads; construct 2 culverts, construct associated road \nImprovement  facilities; and purchase road maintenance equipment. \n  Environmental  Construct 11 public toilets and 26 garbage collection stations; \nImprovement   install 502 trash cans and 130 garbage containers; and purchase \n5 garbage  compaction  trucks,  4  street  sweeper  trucks,  and \n2 sprinkling vehicles. \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n23.  The Project also provides for institutional development and capacity building to ensure \neffective implementation of the Project and sustainable O&M of the project facilities. Capacity \nbuilding will include provision of (i) project management consulting services, and (ii) training \nduring loan implementation. The training program will improve the knowledge and practical skills \n ", "7 \nof the EA and IAs to conduct (i) infrastructure project design, planning, and management; \n(ii) project financing and financial management, including financial accounting, reporting and \nauditing, and project capital budgeting; (iii) traffic planning and management, including public \ntransport and nonmotorized vehicles; and (iv) proactive environmental management and public \neducation.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n24.  Provision  of  Access  to  Environmental  Facilities. The Project will improve urban \ntransport infrastructure and help cities achieve the environmental objectives of the project city \nmaster plans and the 11FYP. The implementation of the proposed roadworks will facilitate \naccess to environmental facilities, including waste treatment plants and landfill sites. It will also \nallow the installation and connections of associated underground wastewater, water supply, \nheating, and gas pipelines for most parts of the project cities. Thus, the Project will improve and \nextend road accessibility and enable connection to environmental facilities. \n \n25.  Enhancement of Essential Road Network. As part of the project cities\u2019 master plans, \nthe proposed road links will be constructed to meet the anticipated traffic demand and to resolve \npart of the existing traffic problems in these cities. Most of the traffic problems or issues \nidentified in these cities are related to traffic engineering and road safety. The Project will \nprovide capacity building in areas of urban transport planning and development control; basic \ntraffic engineering and management techniques; implementation of road safety education; and \nauditing throughout the Project from design, implementation, and operation. Enhancement of \nthe essential road network will enable better management of city urban traffic by reducing traffic \ndelays in their road network, improving public transport services in terms of routing efficiency \nand  journey  time,  and  comfort  of  road  users,  including  pedestrians  and  drivers.  This  is \nparticularly relevant to cities such as Altay, Hami, and Turpan, where tourism is one of the key \neconomic growth drivers. These fast-growing tourism areas are inhabited by a range of ethnic \nminorities, including the Hui, Kazakh, and Uygur, and will benefit from road improvements.     \n \n26.  Promotion  of  Environmental  Protection  Awareness.  The  Project  will  improve \nenvironmental  hygiene  and  public  health  through  the  provision  of  environmental  sanitation \nequipment and facilities. Such facilities include 40 public toilets, 2,212 trash cans, 67 garbage \ncollection stations, and street cleaning trucks along with the road construction. These project \nfacilities will address the present inadequacy of sanitation infrastructure along the roads and will \nincrease the present level of hygiene as well as introduce environmental management principle \nin the project areas.    \n \n27.  Sustainable  environmental  protection  requires  a  well-prepared  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) that covers environmental management, environmental monitoring, \nand institutional enhancement. The plan (i) ensures implementing necessary mitigation and \nenvironmental monitoring measures; and (ii) describes the actions and responsibility of each \nstakeholder involved in implementing the management plan, thereby increasing awareness on \nenvironmental protection. However, a well-prepared plan is not sufficient, as this needs to be \ncomplemented by institutional enhancement. It is necessary to build up and strengthen the \ncapacity of the supervising agencies, project management offices (PMOs), and IAs so that their \ninstitutional  organization  and  responsibilities  are  well  defined  and  recognized  before \ncommencement of the Project. Institutional strengthening, capacity building, and training related \nto environmental sanitation include integrated waste management, waste minimization, better \ndefinitions of waste quantities and compositions of waste, and establishment of clear roles and \nresponsibilities for managing solid waste.   \n ", "8 \n28.  Environmental protection is not just the responsibility of the Government; the public also \nplays  an  important  part.  Environmental  protection  education  through  media  and  education \ninstitutes is an effective approach to help achieve project objectives. The Project will initiate \npublic awareness and participation activities that will cover the full range of stakeholders, with \nspecial focus on women and children.   \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n29.  The project investment cost is estimated at $187.2 million, including taxes and duties of \n$26.6 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, interest, and other \ncharges during implementation.

Financing Plan \n30.  The Government has requested a loan of $100.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to finance 53% of the cost of the Project. The loan will cover civil works, equipment \nand supplies, project management consulting services and training, financial charges on the \nloan during construction, and bank charges on the project imprest account. The Government will \nfinance contingencies, taxes, duties, and land acquisition and resettlement costs. The city \ngovernments of Altay, Changji, Hami, Kuytun, and Turpan through tax and nontax revenues will \nprovide counterpart funding, for which they have provided commitment letters to XUARG and \nADB.  \n \n31.  A financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 3 and the details of the cost \nestimates and financing plans for each component are in Appendix 4. A loan of $100.0 million \n ", "9 \nfrom the ordinary capital resources of ADB will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n32.  The borrower of the loan is the PRC. The loan will be entirely made available to XUARG. \nDifferent portions of the loan proceeds will be made available to concerned city governments. \nThe terms and conditions of such loan proceeds transferred within the government system will \nbe the same as those of the ADB loan. The respective recipient city governments will bear the \nforeign exchange and interest rate variation risks in proportion to the loan amount they receive. \nThe indicative flow of funds and onlending arrangements are in Appendix 5.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n33.  XUARG is the EA for the Project. A project leading group (PLG) has been established \nunder the chairmanship of a vice governor of XUARG to provide overall guidance and support to \nthe  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  Project  and  to  liaise  with  ADB,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance, and the National Development and Reform Commission. A regional project PMO11 has \nbeen established under the PLG, chaired by the director of the Xinjiang Construction Bureau. \nThe PMO members include officials from the Xinjiang Construction Bureau, Xinjiang Finance \nBureau, and Xinjiang Development and Reform Commission. The PMO will undertake day-to-\nday activities including interdepartmental coordination and liaison with the consulting team and \nADB on matters relating to the preparation and implementation of the Project. Details of the \nproject organization are in Appendix 6. Details of the institutional arrangement and assessment \nof the EA and IAs are in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n34.  The municipal government of each project city has established city PLGs and PMOs that \nare  responsible  for  (i)  project  implementation  in  the  respective  cities,  (ii)  liaison  with  the \n                                                 \n11 The executing agency and the regional PMO are the same as for the ADB-financed Loan 2420-PRC: Xinjiang \nMunicipal Infrastructure and Environmental Improvement Project. See footnote 8. \n ", "10 \nprovincial PMO, (iii) project financing, and (iv) overseeing the work of the IAs. The construction \nbureau in each project city will be responsible for project component construction and O&M of \nthe project facilities. The construction bureaus are departments of the municipal governments \nand report to the heads of municipal governments.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n35.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years from 2009 to 2014. The \nestimate  for  the  implementation  period  is  based  on  the  project  scope,  the  construction \ntechnology  requirements,  and  climate  conditions.  The  schedule  is  considered  realistic  and \nachievable because the EA (i) has experience with implementation of World Bank- and ADB-\nfinanced projects, (ii) the project implementation structure is in place, and (iii) preparatory works \nare under way. ADB\u2019s prior experience with similar projects in the PRC, combined with the \nknowledge  and  experience  of  XUARG  in  municipal  infrastructure  and  environmental \nimprovement  projects,  indicates  that  the  schedule  is  realistic  and  achievable.  The  project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Consulting Services \n \n36.  Goods, works, and services financed under the loan will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Preliminary  contract  packages  have  been  formulated  in \nconsultation with the IAs, and a procurement capacity assessment of the EA, PMOs, and IAs \nhas been undertaken. Contracts for goods estimated to cost $1.0 million or more, and contracts \nfor  works  estimated  to  cost  $10.0  million  or  more  shall  be  procured  using  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost less \nthan the above ICB thresholds but more than $100,000 shall be procured on the basis of \nnational competitive bidding (NCB) procedures in accordance with the PRC tendering and \nbidding  laws,  subject  to  modifications  agreed  with  ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works \nestimated to cost $100,000 or less shall be procured using shopping procedures. Prior review \nwill be applied for all ICB contracts, the first NCB contract for works and goods, and post review \nfor other procurement modes.  \n \n37.  Preliminary contract packages have been formulated in consultation with the IAs and a \nprocurement capacity assessment of the EA, PMOs, and IAs has been undertaken. Based on \nthe assessment, it is recommended that prior review be applied for all ICB contracts and the first \nNCB contract for works and goods in each project city, together with the post review for other \nprocurement  modes.  A  procurement  plan  for  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  8.  Details  of  the \nprocurement assessment of the executing and implementing agencies are in Supplementary \nAppendix F.  \n \n38.  The Project will provide funding for 17 person-months of international consulting services \nand 35 person-months of national consulting services to support the PMOs and IAs in project \nimplementation and management and institutional capacity building.12 Consulting firms will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection method.13 The Project will provide \nfunding for international consulting services and national consulting services to support the \nXinjiang and city PMOs and IAs in project implementation and management and institutional \ncapacity building. XUARG has requested advance contracting for the recruitment of consultants. \n                                                 \n12 Consulting service inputs estimates are subject to revision based on results of detailed technical design. \n13 The quality- and cost-based selection procedure will be undertaken with the quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. \n ", "11 \nThe consulting services will cover (i) support to the Xinjiang and city PMOs and IAs in project \npreparation and management, (ii) PPMS, (iii) transport planning and traffic control, (iv) financial \nmanagement,  (v)  social  development,  (vi) environmental  management,  (vii)  O&M,  and  (viii) \ninstitutional strengthening. Capacity building for the PMOs and IAs will be achieved through \nconsultant inputs, training courses provided by universities, specialized institutes and firms, in-\ncountry and/or overseas study visits, and acquisition of additional equipment financed from the \nloan. Outline terms of reference for project consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix \nG. \n \n4.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n39.  To expedite project implementation, XUARG has requested advance contracting for the \nrecruitment of consultants, training, and procurement of goods and civil works. It has also \nrequested retroactive financing of eligible expenditures of up to $20 million (equivalent to 20% of \nthe  ADB  loan).  Advance  contracting  will  include  (i)  preparation  of  tender  documents,  (ii) \nevaluation of bids, and (iii) recruitment of consultants. All advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing will be undertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The issuance of \ninvitations to bid under advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB \napproval. XUARG has been informed that retroactive financing is permitted only if (i) it is \nspecifically agreed by ADB and the Borrower; (ii) the goods, works, services, and consultants \nfor which it is requested are procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines or \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants; and (iii) the amount to be retroactively financed does not \nexceed  20%  of  the  loan  amount.  The  expenditures  must  have  been  incurred  before \neffectiveness of the loan, but generally no earlier than 12 months before the signing date of the \nLoan Agreement. The Government, XUARG, and the IAs have also been advised that approval \nof advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n40.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  EA,  PMOs,  and  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and will be included in the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. XUARG has \nindicated its commitment to fight corruption and a number of anticorruption actions will be \nincluded as covenants in the Loan and Project Agreements. Under these covenants, XUARG \nwill  \n \n(i)  involve  the  agencies  responsible  for  oversight  of  each  IA  in  bidding  and \nconstruction to enhance construction quality control and supervise effective work;  \n(ii)  introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract winner also \nsigns an anticorruption contract with the employer;  \n(iii)  periodically inspect the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and \nsettlements; and  \n(iv)  engage a project management consultant to support the Xinjiang and city PMOs \nand the IAs to ensure good governance, accountability, and transparency in \nproject operations. \n ", "12 \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n41.  The ADB loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project \nimplementation through timely release of loan proceeds, XUARG will immediately establish an \nimprest  account  after  loan  effectiveness  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB. \nDisbursement to the IAs from the imprest account will be based on the actual expenditures and \nsubmission of full supporting documentation to XUARG. Such documentation will demonstrate \nthat, among other things, the goods and/or services have been produced in or from ADB\u2019s \nmembers, and are eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  the  Project\u2019s  estimated  implementation  expenditures  for  the  next \n6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The ADB statement of expenditures \nprocedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures. Individual payments to be \nreimbursed or liquidated under the procedure will not exceed $200,000. The statement of \nexpenditures procedure will be used only at XUARG level to request withdrawals from ADB. \nDirect  payment  procedures  may  be  used  for  large  civil  works  contracts.  Following  the \nrecommendation  of  the  financial  management  assessment  to  improve  the  internal  control \nsystem  of  the  IAs,  XUARG  will  review  and  approve  all  withdrawal  applications  prior  to \nsubmission to ADB.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n42.  The Xinjiang PMO will coordinate with the city PMOs to prepare semiannual progress \nreports indicating progress made, problems encountered during the period under review, steps \ntaken or proposed to remedy the problems, the proposed program of activities, and progress \nexpected in the next 6 months. The IAs will keep records to allow the identification of goods and \nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  following  accounting  principles  and  practices \nprescribed by the accounting laws of the PRC. This law requires that the financial statements \nshall  generally  follow  recognized  accounting  standards.  The  IAs  will  set  up  and  maintain \nseparate project accounts and records. The financial statements of project accounts and the \nannual corporate financial statements for IAs will be subject to external audit by the audit bureau \nof the cities concerned, the XUARG audit bureau, and the state audit bureau. The audits will be \ncarried out in accordance with PRC audit regulations and must meet ADB requirements. A \nseparate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure will \nbe part of the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual audited financial statements and audited project \naccounts will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year \nthroughout the implementation period. XUARG and the IAs will submit reports and information \nto ADB concerning the use of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and IA performance. \nThese reports will include (i) semiannual progress reports on project implementation, (ii) annual \nreports, and (iii) a project completion report not later than 3 months after the completion of \nproject facilities. \n \n \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n43.  The PPMS indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities have been discussed \nwith the Xinjiang and city PMOs and IAs during project preparation. The indicators are based on \nthe  monitoring  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  At  the  start  of  project \nimplementation, the Xinjiang and city PMOs and IAs, with the loan implementation consultant\u2019s \nassistance, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures to systematically generate data on \n ", "13 \nthe inputs and outputs of the subcomponents, as well as the indicators to be used to measure \nthe project impact. The Xinjiang and city PMOs will (i) refine the PPMS; (ii) confirm achievable \ntargets; (iii) finalize monitoring and recording arrangements; and (iv) establish systems and \nprocedures, no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n44.  In addition to joint project reviews carried out at least once a year, ADB, XUARG, and \nthe  IAs  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  2  years  after  the  start  of  project \nimplementation.  This  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for \npolicy  reform  and  capacity-building  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS  activities  will  be \nanalyzed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n45.  Social  Aspects.  According  to  the  socioeconomic  survey  undertaken  during  project \npreparation, the urban poverty rate is 27% in Altay, 10.9% in Changji, 17.4% in Hami, 8.5% in \nKuytun, and 12% in Turpan. Average per capita incomes are CNY1,332 per annum ($0.52 per \nday)  in  Altay,  CNY1,493  ($0.58  per  day)  in  Changji,  CNY1,116  ($0.44  per  day)  in  Hami, \nCNY1,000 ($0.39 per day) in Kuytun, and CNY918 ($0.36 per day) in Turpan. The Project has a \nrange of benefits, including the generation of employment opportunities directly and indirectly \nrelated  to  the  Project.  The  road  construction  and  upgrading  will  facilitate  greater  mobility, \naccess, and affordability for the local population to key basic services and destinations and will \nmake  urban  roads  safer  for  travel  thereby  reducing  traffic  accidents.  Measures  include \nconstruction of footpaths, street lighting, controlled pedestrian crossings, and traffic calming. \nEnvironmental improvements are associated with a greater emphasis on public hygiene through \nthe  provision  of  public  toilets  (and  bathrooms  in  one  city)  and  sustainable  solid  waste \nmanagement  practices.  The  Project  is  classified  a  targeted  intervention  for  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) 7 Target 10. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 9.  \n \n46.  The roads to be upgraded for the Kuytun component will be on existing alignments and \nwill involve merely road surfacing. Although this component will also occupy a large amount of \nstate-owned  land,  the  land  is  not  fertile  and  no  people  will  be  affected.  Therefore,  no \nresettlement plan is required for the Kuytun component. Four full resettlement plans have been \nprepared for the Altay, Changji, Hami, and Turpan components in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), endorsed by the relevant city PMOs and uploaded on \nthe ADB website. During project implementation, the resettlement plans will be updated based \non  detailed  engineering  design,  disclosed  to  affected  persons,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval prior to award of civil works contracts. To avoid or minimize land acquisition and \nresettlement; close consultations with local officials, village committees, and affected persons \nwere undertaken during resettlement plan preparation. The Altay, Changji, Hami, and Turpan \nPMOs will retain the services of a domestic external monitor every 6 months to (i) review \nresettlement progress and the general welfare of those affected; (ii) recommend ways to resolve \nany issues or problems; and (iii) provide advice to IAs and local officials, and submit such \nreports to ADB. The summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n47.  The Project is classified category A for indigenous peoples. To ensure that the Project \nwill  benefit  indigenous  people,  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  has  been \ndeveloped for each project city. Xinjiang is predominantly an ethnic minority region of Western \n ", "14 \nPRC, and 40.0% of its population is Han. The major ethnic group is the Uygur, constituting \n45.9%  of  the  total  population.  Other  significant  ethnic  minority  groups  include  the  Kazakh \nconstituting 6.9% of the total population and the Hui constituting 4.4%. Of the five cities, Turpan \nhas the highest percentage of ethnic minorities (78%), followed by Altay (39%), Changji (28%), \nand Kuytun (5%). The Project has been designed and reflected in the EMDPs for each of the \nfive cities and the social action plan to ensure that the specific social aspects of each of the five \ncities are incorporated into overall project design. The EMDPs have been endorsed by the \nrelevant city PMOs and uploaded on the ADB website. The summary EMDP is in Appendix 11.  \n \n48.  Financial Aspects. The historical financial performance of the IAs has been analyzed to \ndetermine whether they can provide the required counterpart funds during the construction \nperiod and necessary funds for O&M and debt service during the operating period. In addition, \nannual  average  growth  rates  of  revenues  and  expenditures  during  the  project  period  are \ncalculated.  All  IAs  operate  as  departments  of  their  respective  city  governments.  The \nconstruction bureaus are financed through tax and nontax revenues, and annual operational \nbudgets are provided by the city governments. Annual forecast of debt service and O&M costs \nfor the Altay, Changji, Hami, Kuytun, and Turpan components were compared with the relevant \nannual revenues and indicated acceptable fiscal risk since it is expected that city government \nrevenues  will  grow  in  line  with  economic  development,  providing  more  mobility  to  finance \nproposed project components, and central budget transfers and municipal bond issues will \nprovide additional cushion to the provincial and city budgets.  \n \n49.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  XUARG  and  the  IAs  and  their  previous \nexperience  in  managing  investment  projects  financed  by  international  financial  institutions \nconfirms that the financial management systems and practices of the EA and IAs are adequate \nfor implementation of the Project.  \n \n50.  The overall financial management arrangements of the IAs are generally satisfactory \nand reliable. All IAs will establish and maintain separate project accounts and records, which will \nbe  audited in  accordance  with  the  PRC  audit  regulations  and  meet ADB  requirements.  A \nseparate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure will \nbe part of the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual audited financial statements and audited project \naccounts will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year \nthroughout the implementation period. XUARG and the IAs will submit reports and information \nto ADB concerning the use of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and performance.   \n \n51.  The  Project  will  assist  each  of  the  IAs  to  establish  a  sound  and  solid  financial \nmanagement system for project implementation. A capacity building component to strengthen \nfinancial management has been included in the Project. The capacity building component will \nstrengthen IAs\u2019 capacity in: (i) financial management, project finance, accounting, and business \nplanning; and (ii) management information system and cost management and control. The \nfinancial analysis of the Project is in Appendix 12. \n \n52.  Economic Aspects. The economic analysis for the Project covers (i) the economic \nrationale for public intervention, (ii) the goals of the investment plan, and (iii) the design of the \nplan. The economic rationale is sound as the Project will (i) support XUARG in promoting urban \ndevelopment of the cities in a more coordinated and cost-effective manner; and (ii) bring about \nmore sustainable investments in infrastructure, which aim to support inclusive economic growth \nand improve the quality of life. The economic analysis also evaluates the components relative to \nleast-cost analysis criteria and standard benefit-cost analysis. The results of the economic \nanalysis  indicate  that  the  project  components  are  economically  viable  and  the  subproject \n ", "15 \ncomponents stand up to sensitivity analyses that combined variations of costs increases and \nbenefits decreases. A summary economic analysis is in Appendix 13. Under various sensitivity \nanalyses,  including  increase  in  costs  and  decrease  in  benefits,  a  delay  of  project \nimplementation by 1 year does not have a significant impact on the base case economic internal \nrate of return. The overall economic internal rate of return under the base case is 19.7%, which \nis above the 12.0% economic opportunity cost of capital.   \n \n53.  Environmental Aspects. The Project is classified environment category A. Extensive \npublic consultations involving surveys, meetings with stakeholders, and focus group discussions \nwere undertaken during project preparation. A summary  environmental impact assessment \n(SEIA) has been prepared based on the domestic environmental impact assessments (EIAs). In \naddition, a peer review meeting to discuss the draft SEIA was held in ADB on 29 May 2008. \nComments from ADB have been incorporated in the final SEIA, which was prepared by XUARG. \nThe SEIA was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and posted on the ADB website on \n26 September 2008.  \n \n54.  The Project will improve the living and working environment of residents in the project \ncities. Construction of sanitation facilities will have environmental and public health benefits. The \nconstruction of public toilets, garbage bins, and garbage storage and transfer stations are \nimportant subcomponents to achieve these benefits. If sanitation facilities are not in place at the \nscheduled time, there would be adverse impacts on environmental and ecological resources in \nthe conservation areas. Health impact analysis is in Supplementary Analysis H.    \n \n55.  The project cities and the hinterland areas presently lack adequate road networks and \nconstruction of new roads will improve connectivity within them. Upgrading of existing dirt roads \nwill improve the currently dusty conditions during the dry season and muddy conditions during \nrainy  and  winter  seasons,  which  is  a  major  inconvenience  to  the  residents.  The  above \nroadworks  will  also  provide  opportunities  to  install  or  upgrade  municipal  services  such  as \npipelines, cables and conduits for water supply, wastewater collection, power, heating, and \ntelecommunications  that  will  bring  environmental  and  social  benefits  to  the  population. \nImportantly, the Project provides an opportunity for XUARG to put in place sound environmental \nmanagement systems in fast growing cities and towns before economic development begins to \ntake off, and establish adequate institutional capacity to ensure environmental sustainability for \nfuture developments. \n \n56.  During  the  construction  works,  dust  from  construction  sites,  noise  from  powered \nmechanical equipment, wastewater, solid wastes, and construction traffic are expected to be the \nmajor potential adverse impacts. Good project management and effective mitigation measures \nhave been identified through environmental assessment and are described in the EMP. With \nproper implementation of the EMP, the impacts will be mitigated to acceptable levels. The EMP \nalso includes institutional strengthening for implementation of the mitigation measures and \nundertaking of the monitoring requirements. The EMP will be further developed as the Project \nprogresses so that all mitigation requirements are met. \n \n57.  Project  Risks  and  Mitigation  Measures.  The  main  project  risks  include  (i)  timely \nprovision of counterpart funding; (ii) low institutional capacity in terms of project technical, \nfinancial, and environmental management and failure of the PMOs, IAs, and O&M organizations \nto monitor environmental impacts and implement the EMP during construction and operation of \nthe Project; and (iii) timely construction of project infrastructure caused by a short construction \nperiod. These risks will be mitigated through a set of measures such as (i) obtaining formal \ncommitment from the project city governments and loan assurances with regard to adequate \n ", "16 \nand timely allocation of counterpart funds in the city budgets during the project implementation \nperiod;  (ii)  providing  extensive  training  in  project  technical,  financial,  and  environmental \nmanagement  under  the  Project;  (iii)  selecting  qualified  project  implementation  consultants; \n(iv) following appropriate project implementation monitoring and mitigation arrangements; and \n(v) active project management assistance from the ADB project team. Project risks, mitigation \nmeasures, and sustainability are outlined in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n58.  In  addition to  the  standard  assurances,  the Government  of  the  PRC;  XUARG;  city \ngovernments  of  Altay,  Changji,  Hami,  Kuytun,  and  Turpan;  and  IAs  have  given  specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  XUARG  will  cause  the  IAs  to  ensure  that  all  the  works  of  the  Project  are \ndesigned  and  constructed  in  accordance  with  national  standards  and \nspecifications,  and  that  the  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  contract \nmanagement,  and  completion  inspection  and  acceptance  follow  applicable \nnational laws and regulations. \n(ii)  XUARG will cause the IAs to, with the assistance of the loan implementation \nconsultant,  prepare  and  submit  training  plans  to  be  implemented  under  the \nProject for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence, and ensure that training institutes for \nsuch purpose be selected in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. \nFollowing each training event, the concerned IA will submit a training completion \nreport to Xinjiang PMO for consolidation and transmission to ADB. \n(iii)  XUARG will cause each project city and municipal government and IA to ensure \nthat (a) all local and foreign currency counterpart financing necessary for the \nProject  will  be  provided  in  time  as  required  to  enable  completion  of  project \nactivities, and prompt debt repayment after project completion; (b) additional \ncounterpart funding will be provided for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns; \nand (c) in each fiscal year adequate funds are allocated for O&M of the project \nfacilities, and such facilities are operated and maintained in good condition. \n(iv)  XUARG  will  cause  the  IAs  to  establish  and  maintain  a  sound  financial \nmanagement  system  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB (2002), \nincluding the establishment of separate bank accounts and the maintenance of \nminimum balances to ensure smooth cash flow and the timely settlement of \nproject  construction  liabilities  and  future  debt  servicing.

Urban Development in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n1.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is undergoing rapid urbanization. From 1980 and \n2006, the urban population increased from 190 million to 577 million, comprising 44% of the \nnational population. It is estimated that by 2015 the urban population will reach 50% of the \nnational population. By 2020, the PRC will have about 70\u2013100 cities with populations exceeding \n1 million people, which will account for about 30% of the national population. The 11th Five-\nYear Plan (11FYP) 2006\u20132010 recognizes urbanization as one of the vehicles to reduce the \nurban\u2013rural income gap and alleviate poverty.1 Rapid economic development has impacted the \nenvironment  and  municipal  services,  and  requires  implementation  of  coherent  and \ncomprehensive urban planning and management. Investments in road construction prevailed \nover  investments  in  road  maintenance  and  traffic  management,  and  pedestrians  and \nnonmotorized  transport  have  been  marginalized,  posing  serious  safety  hazards  for  traffic \nparticipants.   \n \n2.  Growth  of  vehicle  ownership,  an  increase  in  road  accidents,  and  lack  of  parking \nmanagement have compounded the conditions of the urban transport sector. Without prompt \nmitigation measures aimed at improving urban transport management, the quality of life and \nefficiency  of  urban  economies  could  be  hampered.  It  is  also  important  to  improve  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  local  government  agencies  to  undertake  urban  planning  and \nmanagement to ensure the sustainability of urban infrastructure. Development of urban public \ntransport systems and improvement of the environment were prioritized in the Prime Minister\u2019s \nReport on the Work of the Government for 2008.2  \n \nB.  The National Strategy for Development of the West \n3.  The PRC\u2019s Western Region has not benefited as much as the coastal regions from rapid \neconomic  growth  and  reforms.  Urban  infrastructure  and  service  provision  cannot  match \nincreasing demand\u2014thereby  hindering  investment,  degrading  the  environment,  and  limiting \ngrowth opportunities. In 1999, the Government launched the National Strategy for Development \nof the West to promote balanced growth, stimulate economic development, and raise living \nstandards in the Western Region.3 This strategy remains a key thrust for the 11FYP, which \nfocuses on improving border facilities, strengthening cooperation and trade with neighboring \ncountries, improving infrastructure, protecting the environment, and encouraging private sector \ninvestment. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is actively supporting this initiative. \n \n4.  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  (Xinjiang),  located  in  the  northwest  PRC,  has \n46 ethnic minority groups that represent about 62% of its population. Sharing 5,600 kilometers \n(km) of frontier with eight countries, it is the gateway between the PRC and the Central Asian \nrepublics,  with  which  it  has  many  cultural  similarities  and  economic  complementarities.  Its \nhistory and ethnic culture have promoted tourism development and its rich natural resources \nprovide a sound basis for development.

Land Use Transport Planning \n5.  As with many other areas in the PRC, the cities of Xinjiang face the challenge of \nincreasing demand for urban utilities. The lack of land use transportation planning has led to \npoor  provisions  in  infrastructure  and  environmental  protection  and  has  an  impact  on  the \ntransport strategy, public transport provisions, and road safety considerations for pedestrians, \ncyclists,  drivers,  and  passengers.  Poor  traffic  management  has  contributed  to  reduced \naccessibility and an increase in traffic accidents. \n \n6.  The City of Changji is the only one among the five project cities that has conducted a \ncomprehensive  land  use  transport  study  as  the  first  step  toward  the  sustainability  of \ninfrastructure developments. The other four cities (Altay, Hami, Kuytun, and Turpan) have not \nundertaken any comprehensive land use transport study as part of their medium and longer-\nterm transport planning. The Project will offer an opportunity for these four cities to improve their \nplanning techniques as part of the planning capacity building program.

The Need for Road Improvements and Road Safety \n7.  After years of construction, many cities in Xinjiang have established basic urban road \nnetworks. However, the conditions of many networks are not satisfactory and suffer from the \nslow pace of road construction, poor maintenance, and inadequate transport infrastructure \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nplanning and management. The road subcomponents of the Project will fulfill the functional \nurban transport requirements of the city urban areas. Apart from improving accessibility, they \nwill provide an opportunity for extension of municipal services to the existing and proposed \nurban infrastructure premises, thereby enhancing the urban living environment.  \n \n8.  Road  safety,  which  has  always  been  a  concern  in  the  urban  development  sector, \ninvolves road safety education for different groups of people in the project cities; design of \ntransport  facilities  with  road  safety  considerations  and  enforcement;  and  a  set  of  other \nmeasures aimed to increase road safety, accessibility, and efficiency. Therefore, improvement \nof road safety and traffic control has been identified as the prime concern in managing transport \ninfrastructure in the project cities. The 3-year traffic accident records (2005\u20132007) indicate that \nthe number of accidents in the project cities is high. The lack of road safety consideration in the \ndesign of transport infrastructure, general road safety education, and traffic safety enforcement \nare the main reasons for the high incidence of road accidents.  \n \nE.  Air Quality and Vehicle Emission Control \n9.  The ambient air quality in the PRC\u2019s cities is poor, but it is difficult to distinguish the \ncontributing share to the pollution from local industries and vehicle emissions. The concentration \nof nitrogen dioxide (NO ), sulfur dioxide (SO ) and total suspended particle level particulate \n2 2 ,\nmatters  (PM ) in the project cities complies with the class II air quality standards of the PRC.4 \n10 10\nThe existing vehicular emission levels were monitored in the project cities and projected for the \nscenarios with the proposed road improvements as part of the environmental assessment \nrequired by the city authorities. The assessment reveals that the concentrations of NO  and CO \n2\nfrom traffic emissions will comply with the class II Environment Air Quality Standards during the \nroad design horizon of 15 years.  \n \nF.  Public Transport and Nonmotorized Transport \n10.  The Project will improve the internal transport connectivity of the five cities and at the \nsame time, it offers the opportunity to improve and extend their public transport services to \nunderserved or poorly served urban areas. The provision of public transport facilities includes \nconstruction and installation of bus bays/stops, associated pedestrian crossing facilities along \nthe existing and newly constructed roads, and other facilities including bus terminal facilities at \nboth ends of the bus service routes.  \n \n11.  In collaboration with the city transport planning authorities, the Project will (i) increase \nthe number of paved roads in the city networks; (ii) optimize the number of public transport \nroutes; (iii) improve public transport forecasting, planning, and management; and (iv) increase \nthe number of bus stops/bays, as well bus terminal facilities. The above measures will improve \nthe quality and coverage of public transport systems in the project cities.  \n \n12.  Nonmotorized transport (NMT), mainly bicycles, is still a popular mode of transportation \nin the PRC. Apart from Altay, where hilly topography prevails, cycling is still the most popular \nprivate transport for the other four project cities because it provides door-to-door service for \nshort and medium trips. Therefore, safety and separation of NMT from motorized vehicles on \nroads is an important part of the road safety design considerations of the Project. In terms of \ntraffic control at intersections, NMT should be given higher priority over other motorized vehicles. \n                                                 \n4  The Ambient Air Quality Standards of the People's Republic of China (GB3095, 1996). The standards are \ncategorized into five classes, class I being the best and class V being the worst. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nThe road subcomponents under the Project will take this particular road safety aspect into \naccount. \n \nG.  Road Maintenance \n13.  The  common  approach  to  road  maintenance  adopts  a  periodic  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation program. As the pavement condition deteriorates, major maintenance work is \nrequired,  but  because  of  maintenance  budget  constraints,  defects  have  to  be  addressed \nthrough a routine maintenance program that means further reductions in periodic maintenance \nand rehabilitation. Today, the existing road networks in the project cities are poorly maintained \nbecause of inefficient management of the road maintenance system and insufficient financial, \ntechnical, and human resources allocated for road operation and maintenance (O&M). The \nmunicipal governments have failed to allocate sufficient budget resources to finance routine \nroad maintenance. Instead, maintenance is conducted on an ad hoc basis and financed through \nloans  from  local  banks.  To  meet  the  O&M  requirements,  the  Project  will  (i)  procure  road \nmaintenance equipment; (ii) provide capacity building on road maintenance systems to develop \nand sustain a professional and efficient approach that quantifies the long-term maintenance \nrequirements; and (iii) help estimate realistic expenditures for maintaining the roads in the \nproject cities. Training for the maintenance staff on the characteristics of bituminous materials \nunder extreme weather conditions and repair methods for various kinds of defects is important.  \n \nH.  Municipal Waste Collection Facilities \n14.  The completion of roadworks will enhance economic activities along the roads and lead \nto  more  pollution  loading,  such  as  wastewater  and  solid  waste.  While  other  international \nfinancial institutions are financing the water and wastewater sector, this Project focuses on \nproviding public toilet and municipal waste collection and transportation equipment for O&M \nafter the completion of roadworks.  \n \n15.  The project cities have experienced a rapid increase in municipal waste generation \nduring the last decade as a result of rapid urbanization and economic growth. They are now \nfacing multiple problems in municipal waste collection and transportation. The equipment for \nmunicipal collection and transportation is insufficient. There is lack of road infrastructure to \naccess the existing sanitation facilities, such as landfill sites. Moreover, none of the five project \ncities has snow removing trucks, which hampers the collection and transport of municipal waste \nduring  the  adverse  weather  in  winter.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGYa \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Xinjiang Urban Transport and Environmental Project will contribute to poverty reduction through improvements in urban \ntransport network connectivity and environmental conditions, promoting sustainable economic growth, and supporting institutional \nreforms in five of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\u2019s (Xinjiang) cities: Altay, Changji, Hami, Kuytun, and Turpan. Xinjiang is the \nlargest region (17% of total area) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), with a relatively small population (20,500,000), \n60.39% of which belongs to ethnic minority groups (the Uygur is the largest, constituting 45% of this total). As the historic Silk Road \npasses through it, Xinjiang has a rich history and culture that is now serving as the base for development of the tourism industry in \nthe Region. Despite these assets, it remains one of the poorest regions in the PRC, with 22 out of 27 cities and 68 counties \nclassified poor. In 2007, about 8.1% of Xinjiang\u2019s urban population lived on incomes below the official poverty line, compared with \nthe national average of 4.0%, with even higher rates of poverty for ethnic minorities living in the cities of Xinjiang. The Project is in \nline with the Government's strategy to develop the Western Region of the country, which seeks to reduce the economic and social \ndisparities created by the eastern PRC\u2019s rapid economic development and supports the Government\u2019s development vision of \nxiaokang (moderately well-off, articulated in the 11th Five-Year Plan [11FYP] 2006\u20132010), aimed at maintaining high rates of \ngrowth, but channeling it toward poverty reduction and reducing disparities. The Project supports ADB\u2019s PRC country partnership \nstrategy  priority  areas  of  (i)  strengthening  economic  and  social  inclusiveness  through  increasing  investment  in  the  urban \ndevelopment of small cities, (ii) improving the physical environment of small cities, and (iii) promoting regional cooperation and \nintegration.b The Project will do the following: \n \n(i)  Create jobs and employment opportunities. It is anticipated that 3,396 full-time jobs during the construction period and \n8,114 follow-on multiplier effect jobs will be created. Of the total construction jobs created, 75% will be for unskilled \nworkers. The loan assurances specifically address employment of vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, and women. \n(ii)  Improve living standards. Road construction will facilitate mobility, access, and affordability for local populations to key \nbasic services and destinations. It will also make urban roads safer for travel, thereby reducing the number of traffic \naccidents. Measures include the construction of footpaths, street lighting, controlled pedestrian crossings, and traffic \ncalming measures. The environmental improvements  will improve health-related  issues associated  with a greater \nemphasis on public hygiene through the provision of public toilets and bathrooms, sustainable solid waste management \npractices, and improvement in the general aesthetic appearance of urban areas. \n(iii) Protect the environment. The environmental management plan (EMP) outlines clear actions for environmental protection \n(land, water, and archaeological sites) during construction, and these are accounted for in the loan assurances.  \n(iv) Focus on predominantly ethnic minority areas. Xinjiang is predominantly an ethnic minority region. Of the five cities, \nTurpan has the highest percentage of ethnic minorities (78%), followed by Altay (39%), Hami (28%), Changji (22%), and \nKuytun (5%). Ethnic minority development plans (EMDPs) have been formulated for each of the project cities. These \nplans ensure mitigation of negative impacts and attempt to maximize participation of and benefits for ethnic minority \npopulations in the project cities.  \n(v) Provide skills training. The Project will include skills training (including language) to support job opportunities such as \noperation and maintenance of public toilets/bathrooms, construction, peri-urban agriculture and local tourism. Vulnerable \ngroups, ethnic minorities, and women are prioritized for this training in the loan assurances. \n(vi) Support gender inclusion. Loan assurances will ensure the participation of women through the Project. In addition, a \nGender and Development Fund grant proposal has been initiated to support the development of Turpan women\u2019s cultural \ntourism enterprises. This grant will also facilitate women\u2019s involvement in decision-making and development activities in \nTurpan. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (Millennium Development Goal 7, Target 10) \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Project is classified as targeted intervention\u2013Millennium Development Goal (goal 7, target 10). It will benefit 227,778 people in \nAltay, 403,218 in Changji, 418,918 in Hami, 302,089 in Kuytun, and 260,271 in Turpan. The urban poverty rate in Altay according \nto the project socioeconomic surveys is 27.0% (41.7% for ethnic minorities and 27.7% for single adult households), Changji 10.9% \n(13.3% for ethnic minorities and 10.5% for single adult households), Hami 17.4% (30.7% for ethnic minorities and 18.8% for single \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \nadult households), Kuytun 8.5% (13.6% for ethnic minorities and 16.5% for single adult households), and Turpan 12% (19.6% for \nethnic minorities and 13% for single adult households). Average per capita incomes for poor households in Altay are CNY1,332 per \nannum ($0.52 per day), Changji CNY1,493 per annum ($0.58 per day), Hami CNY1,116 per annum ($0.44 per day), Kuytun \nCNY1,000 per annum ($0.39 per day), and Turpan CNY918 ($0.36 per day). \n \nThe causes of poverty in the five project cities vary. In Altay, there are few employment or other income-generation activities \noutside the public sector because it is a relatively small and remote city. In Changji and Hami, while a significant number of \nhouseholds derive income from agricultural-based activities, unless they also derive a portion of their income from nonfarm income-\ngeneration activities, they are relatively poor. The poorest households are largely urban-based, with no options for livelihood \ndiversification. In Kuytun, the very poorest are those that have to rely on day wage-labor and are temporary workers in the oil fields. \nIn Turpan, the very poor are those households that do not have access to public sector employment and rely on seasonal tourism \nfor income generation. In all five project cities, the poor are typically less well-educated, are likely to fall ill more often, and have a \nhigher dependency ratio. All poor households surveyed by the Project have a small annual surplus of income over expenditure but \nthe level of savings is very low and other assets such as housing are lower in value than for non-poor households. Poor \nhouseholds cannot easily trade their way out of poverty either because they lack access to affordable micro-finance and the \nmanagement skills and experience to develop and operate small businesses profitably. \n \nProject benefits for poor people will include project-related employment and expanded employment opportunities as a result of \nimprovements to urban transport infrastructure that will improve access to local employment opportunities and the ability to provide \na range of goods and services more readily to other consumers\u2014including tourists in Altay, Turpan, and Hami, oil and gas workers \nin Kuytun, and new investors in Changji city\u2019s economic development. The household survey and focus group discussion (FGD) \nrevealed that the poor are more likely to be pedestrians, have own forms of non-motorized transport (NMT), and benefit from \nimproved traffic management and road safety. Personal security, especially for poor women and children, will also be improved \nthrough the provision of street lighting. In Altay, the Project has been able to respond effectively to local demands, and culturally \nappropriate toilets and bathrooms will be constructed for communal use. Other environmental improvements common to all five \ncities will contribute to improvements in public hygiene that will benefit the poor.  \n \n2. Design Features  \nThe  design  has  been  highly  participatory  in  nature,  involving  detailed  consultations  with  affected  people\u2014including,  most \nimportantly,  vulnerable  people,  ethnic  minorities,  and  women\u2014in  an  attempt  to  reduce  impacts  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, and maximize opportunities for positive benefits through design and implementation choices. Examples include the \ntime spent on exploring options to the demolition of a century-old mosque in Hami, avoiding the acquisition of arable land in \nChangji and Turpan, mitigating noise and safety risks in close proximity to educational facilities in Altay and Kuytun, and designing \nculturally appropriate community shower and toilet facilities in Altay. Project assurances call for the employment of local labor, \nespecially  vulnerable  people,  ethnic  minorities,  and  women.  EMDPs  outline  strategies  for  mitigating  adverse  impacts  and \npromoting  positive  benefits  such  as  employment,  skills  training,  language  training,  and  cultural  understanding  training  for \ncontractors and workers. An HIV/AIDS awareness program for each of the five cities has been included not just as a reactive \napproach to the social risk but also as a proactive approach to empower workers.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nIndividual households living in close proximity to the roads to be constructed or upgraded will benefit directly from footpaths and \nstreet lighting. This intervention is strongly supported by the majority of people consulted during project design, especially women \nand other NMT road users, because it improves road safety, personal security, and makes movement on foot more convenient. \nThe construction of public toilets in downtown areas will benefit all people who frequent downtown areas for shopping, business, or \nrecreational purposes. Positioning of garbage cans at strategic intervals in downtown areas also contributes to a cleaner and \ngreener environment, rendering each of the five cities better places to live in. FGDs confirmed that the residents of these five cities \nsupport the cleaning and greening of their individual city, although not at the expense of economic development. \n \nImpacts on Health and Safety. Dust generated by unsealed roads in all five cities is considered a major cause of respiratory \ndisorders by at least 40% of the population. The permanent sealing of unsealed roads will contribute to addressing this health \nissue. Rerouting of heavy traffic will result in lower noise levels, especially at night when there is more heavy traffic traveling \nthrough these cities, and will also result in lower exhaust emissions. Over 35% of the people surveyed in each city consider this to \nhave a significant impact on health. Improved public hygiene through better management of solid waste, including rubbish in areas \nwhere the public congregate will also be an outcome of the Project. Households in the project area consider themselves capable of \nmanaging household level hygiene issues but not broader public hygiene issues. Better roads with improved traffic management \nand road safety measures will have a positive impact on the safety of road users, including the users of NMT, because there will be \na more rational and coordinated approach to multimodal forms of transport. Keeping heavy trucks out of residential and downtown \nareas is a very positive safety impact.  \n \nAffordability. This is not an issue in this Project, except for the use of public bathrooms in Altay because the Project will not be \n ", "  Appendix 9  47 \nproviding access to public utilities. In Altay, potential beneficiaries have all agreed they are able and willing to pay for the use of the \nproposed bathrooms because they cannot afford the same in their own houses. Local people will be hired by the city as \nmaintenance workers for this new community infrastructure.  \n \nImpacts on Employment. About 3,396 full-time jobs (1,683 in Altay, 1,278 in Changji, 105 in Hami, 130 in Kuytun, and 200 in \nTurpan) will be created over the construction period and follow-on multiplier effects are expected to create 8,114 full-time jobs \n(220 in  Altay,  5,584  in  Changji,  90  in  Hami,  270  in  Kuytun,  and  1,950  in  Turpan).  This  translates  into  CNY72,215,500 \n(CNY38,539,000 in Altay, CNY24,733,600 in Changji, CNY1,132,900 in Hami, CNY2,842,000 in Kuytun, and CNY4,968,000 in \nTurpan) of costs returned to the northern and central Xinjiang economy. Loan assurances will ensure that vulnerable, ethnic \nminorities, and women are beneficiaries of employment (during construction and operation) opportunities. \n \nThe EMDPs ensure that ethnic minorities will benefit equitably from the Project and that any negative impacts affecting them will be \nreduced or mitigated. Provisions to enhance the economic conditions of ethnic minorities have been integrated into the project \ndesign and project assurances. Compensation and livelihood restoration measures are included in the resettlement plans to ensure \nthat ethnic minority households affected by land acquisition benefit equally from the Project.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. During the project preparatory technical assistance, several participatory approaches were used to solicit inputs from a range of \nstakeholders in the project cities. A socioeconomic survey at the household level covered 806 households and information relating \nto 2,874 people. Thirty FGDs involving an average of 18 persons per FGD or a total of 540 people were also held. In Hami, where \nthe mosque was slated to be demolished based on the preliminary alignment of the road improvement, additional public \nconsultations were held involving the Imam of the mosque, mosque attendees, local traders, merchants and shopkeepers, the \nIslamic Association, community residential centers, and independent experts both in Hami and Urumqi. Four separate visits and \nthree rounds of consultations involving over 500 people were made to clarify this sensitive issue and a detailed narrative of the \ndiscussions and records of those participating in the consultations has been documented. Key informant interviews were also held \nwith  bureaus  and  the  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation  to  inform  the  project  design.  For  the  resettlement  plans,  separate \nsocioeconomic surveys, community meetings, opinion surveys, and specific impact studies of 3,439 affected people were involved. \nDevelopment of the environmental impact assessments and EMP involved two rounds of public consultations. EMDPs have been \nprepared collaboratively and discussed with the communities. The resettlement plans, EMDPs, and EMP set out detailed ongoing \npublic participation plans.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?  Yes      No  \nPublic disclosure of all project documents will be made at the project management office in both Urumqi and each of the project \noffices in the five cities, including appropriate ethnic minority languages on the Asian Development Bank website. This includes the \nproject information document, design and monitoring framework, EMDPs, resettlement plans, summary environmental impact \nassessment, report and recommendation of the President, public sector legal agreement, project administration memorandum, and \nsocial and environmental monitoring reports. A project information document will be prepared for each project city. Booklets \noutlining the resettlement plans will be distributed to the affected households and disclosure meetings will be held. Copies of the \nbooklet will be available for project management offices, and each affected community residential association office. Each project \ninformation document (available in Chinese and local languages) will contain (i) a map of the affected areas; (ii) description of the \nProject, its aims, and subcomponents; (iii) details of the works; (iv) a timetable of the project activities, including estimated \ncommencement and completion dates; (v) expected social, economic, and environmental impacts; (vi) environmental and social \nsafeguards; (vii) the compensation policy and entitlements; (viii) an outline of livelihood restoration measures; (ix) the workings of \nthe  compensation  committee  and  grievance  redress  committee;  (x)  an  outline  of  how  consultation  and  participation  with \nresettlement plans and communities will continue; and (xi) the project communications strategy, including how people can find out \nwhat business opportunities may arise in conjunction with the Project and where people can get further information about the \nProject. Resettlement plans and EMDPs indicate how consultation will continue through implementation.  \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nAside from the economic and employment impacts, the social impacts of the Project are clearly gender based. Upgrading and \nconstructing new footpaths with street lighting, controlled pedestrian crossings, and traffic calming measures are interventions that \nwomen in each of the five project cities strongly support. They also support measures to improve public hygiene associated with \nrubbish collection and for poorer women without access to indoor toilets or bathrooms, the complementary measures proposed are \nmeasures the women themselves proposed. Women anticipate benefits such as an improved living environment, increased road \nsafety and personal security, new employment opportunities, reduced time burdens, and reduced incidence of preventable \ndiseases. \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and use of \nrelevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan         Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n ", "48  Appendix 9 \nProject assurances prioritize women, especially poor and ethnic minority women, for employment and skills training and ensure \nmonitoring of their involvement.

The  Xinjiang  Urban  Transport  and  Environmental  Improvement  Project  (the  Project) \nconsists of five components: (i) Altay Roads and Environmental Improvement Component (Altay \ncomponent), (ii) Changji Roads and Environmental Improvement Component (Changji component), \n(iii) Hami Roads and Environmental Improvement Component (Hami component), (iv) Turpan \nRoads and Environmental Improvement Component (Turpan component), and (v) Kuytun Roads \nand Environmental Improvement Component (Kuytun component). All of the five city components \ninclude construction and installation of environmental sanitation facilities and accessories.  \n \n2.  The Altay component includes the subcomponent to construct and upgrade 19 roads (total \nroad  length  is  28.02  kilometers  [km])  and  5  bridges  with  a  total  length  of  281  meters  (m). \nAdditionally,  there  will  be  construction  of  footpaths,  street  lighting,  and  other  traffic  calming \nsolutions. The environmental sanitation subcomponent includes 10 public toilets and bathhouses, \n654 garbage bins, 102 refuse collection points, and 20 garbage collection stations. A range of \nvehicles will be purchased to collect and dispose of solid waste materials, clean streets, and clear \nsnow. \n \n3.  The Changji component includes the subcomponent to construct/upgrade 8 main roads and \n1 secondary road (total road length is 23.24 km), the 32 m-long South Park Road bridge, and \nmaintenance facilities. The environmental sanitation subcomponent involves the procurement of \n8 public toilets, 394 garbage bins, and 33 refuse collection points; and a variety of vehicles will be \npurchased to collect and dispose of solid waste materials, clean streets, and clear snow. \n \n4.  The Hami component includes the subcomponent to construct/upgrade 3 main roads (total \nroad length is 9.02 km) and the environmental sanitation subcomponent involves the procurement \nof 182 garbage cans in addition to 2 street cleaning machines. \n \n5.  The  Kuytun  component  includes  the  subcomponent  to  construct/upgrade  13  municipal \nroads (total length of 23.6 km) including 2 trunk roads, 2 sub-trunk roads, and 9 branch roads. The \nenvironmental sanitation subcomponent includes 11 public toilets, 26 refuse collection points, \n480 garbage bins, and a variety of vehicles to collect and dispose of solid waste materials, clean \nstreets, and clear snow. \n \n6.  The  Turpan  component  includes  the  subcomponent  to  construct/upgrade  14  municipal \nroads (total length is 22.76 km) including 5 trunk roads, 7 sub-trunk roads, 2 branch roads, and \nconstruct 2 10-m culverts. The environmental subcomponent includes 11 public toilets, 26 refuse \ncollection points, 502 garbage bins, 130 garbage containers, and a variety of vehicles to collect \nand dispose of solid waste materials and clean streets. \n \n7.  Based on the feasibility study report, the Altay, Changji, Hami, and Turpan components will \nnecessitate large amounts of land acquisition and resettlement. The roads to be upgraded in the \nKuytun component will be on existing alignments and will just involve road surfacing. Although this \ncomponent will also occupy a large amount of state-owned land, the land is non-fertile and no \npeople will be affected. Therefore, no resettlement plan will be required for the Kuytun component. \nFour  full  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the  Altay,  Changji,  Hami,  and  Turpan \ncomponents  in  compliance  with  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). During project implementation, the resettlement plans will be updated \nbased on detailed engineering design, disclosed to affected persons, and submitted to ADB for \napproval prior to award of civil works contracts. \n \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \nB.  Resettlement Impacts \n \n8.  To  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  close  consultations  with  local \nofficials, village committees, and affected persons have been undertaken during resettlement plan \npreparation.  \n \n9.  The Project will affect 28 subdistricts/villages/townships/neighborhoods in Altay, Changji, \nHami, and Turpan. Land acquisition and/or house demolition will directly affect 3,921 persons\u2014\n1,475 persons (369 households) from land acquisition; 1,719 persons (449 households) from \nhousehold  demolition;  170  persons  (45  households)  from  both  land  acquisition  and  house \ndemolition; 160 persons from 10 small business shops (9 shops and 1 market); and 397 persons \nfrom 26 enterprises and institutions. About 0.354 square kilometers (km2) of stated-owned land will \nbe permanently occupied, 0.724 km2 of collective land will be acquired and about 0.088 km2 of \nresidential housing will be demolished. The details are summarized in Table A10. \n \nTable A10: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts of the Project \n      Permanent   \n      Permanent   Stated-  \n    Affected  Collective  Owned  Temporary  Households/   \n    Township/  Land  Land  Land  Shops/  Directly \n    Community/  Acquisition Occupation Acquisition Enterprises  Affected \nComponent  Site  Villages  (m2)  (m2)  (m2)  (m2)  Persons \nAltay \n3/ \nAltay  City  7,687  21,393  0  13,187/  346\n    3/        87/ \n    1        2,890 \nChangji \n2/ \nChangji  City  474,382  107,874  0  22,123/  1,511\n    0/        2,214/ \n    8        11,293 \nHami \n1/ \nHami  City  48,047  160,47  0  20,445/  450\n    3/        0/ \n    3        2,581 \nTurpan \n2/ \nTurpan  City  194,148  208,288  0  32,211/  1,614\n    0/        883/ \n    5        100 \n  87,966/ \n  3,184/ \nTotal  8/6/17  724,264  353,602  0  16,864  3,921\nm2= square meter \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nC.  Policy and Legal Framework \n \n10.  The resettlement plans have been prepared in compliance with the Land Administration \nLaw of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2004, relevant regulations of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous \nRegion,  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  Based  on  consultations  with  local \ngovernments and affected persons and general practices in the project area, the implementing \nagencies  (IAs)  adopted  a  set  of  resettlement  principles,  and  an  entitlement  matrix  has  been \nprepared for the Project. Compensation for land acquisition, residential housing, and nonresidential \nbuildings (shops and enterprises) will be paid to all users whether titled or not. For land acquisition, \ncompensation fees include land compensation, resettlement subsidy, and compensation for crops \nand trees. The land compensation will be paid to the affected villages/affected persons and the \n ", "  Appendix 10  51 \nresettlement subsidy to the affected persons. The land acquisition compensation is rated at the \nland\u2019s average annual output value. For business shop and house demolition, compensation will \nbe paid to owners for rehabilitation of the affected persons. The compensation payments will be in \ncash according to the appraised value of the land and fixed property assets. Compensation for \ncrops, trees, other facilities, and temporary impacts will be paid directly to affected persons. \nIncome losses resulting from reduced production/sales and wages caused by the Project will be \nassessed and compensated in cash. \n \nD.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation \n \n11.  To minimize the resettlement impacts to affected persons and restore their living standards, \ndetailed programs of restoration and relocation have been arranged in each resettlement plan. \nPeople  can  choose  the  available  programs  according  to  their  requirements.  Based  on  the \neconomic characteristics of affected villages, different schemes for income restoration will be \ncarried out.  \n \n12.  Since the resettlement impacts differ among the four components, the emphasis varies \naccording to the component. Most of the land acquisition will occur in Changji and most of the \nhouse demolition, including a market demolition, will take place in Turpan. In Altay and Hami there \nis not only land acquisition but also house demolition, and compared with Changji and Turpan the \nimpacts are less significant. \n  \n13.  Some common strategies and measures will be taken in each city for the affected persons \nand villages, including low-yield land improvement and livestock raising. Assistance measures like \nthe provision of employment in project construction, provision of skills training, and employment \ninformation will be provided to all affected persons (at least 50% of whom are women). In Hami \nand Altay, the affected persons who lose all their land can take urban minimum living security. For \nfamilies  that  lose part of  their  land,  the  land  loser is identified  by the  average  area  of land \nacquisition and entered into urban minimum living security. The fund will be operated according to \nthe minimum living support scheme, the calculation, and the amount of land acquisition. Through \nthese measures, it is envisaged that all affected persons can maintain or acquire more stable \nincomes to restore and enhance their living standards.  \n \n14.  Regarding residential housing demolition, irrespective of whether it is urban or rural, the \naffected households will receive compensation at replacement costs for the lost structures and \nattachments  without  depreciation  after  property  assessment.  Urban  households  also  have \ncompensation  for  residential  state-owned  land  after  real  estate  assessment.  Salvage  of  the \nstructural  materials  will  be  allowed  and  a  relocation  subsidy  will  be  provided.  With  the \ncompensation money, the rural affected households can rebuild their houses by themselves with \nfree homestead provided according to their wishes or purchase economically affordable housing \nand resettlement houses. There are low-rental houses, especially for low-income households, in \nwhich they can live on a long-term basis. In the project cities that have more ethnic minorities (like \nHami City and Turpan City), there are several types of resettlement houses such as apartment \nbuildings and one-story houses with a yard. The resettlement plan, in conjunction with the ethnic \nminority development plan, will ensure that ethnic minorities are offered houses consistent with \ntheir cultural preferences.  \n \n15.  For nonresidential buildings and structures (small business shops and enterprises), the \naffected owners will be compensated with cash at replacement costs for the lost structures. The \naffected shops and enterprises can be either moved back and rebuilt on the existing backyard of \nshops along upgraded roads or built on free sites provided by the project management office \n(PMO), depending on the practicality of moving back and their preference. In addition, special \nattention will be paid to vulnerable groups for their resettlement and rehabilitation, who will receive \n ", "52  Appendix 10 \nadditional assistance: (i) set-up of special supporting funds in each component, and (ii) provision of \npotential employment opportunities and skills training. \n \nE.  Resettlement Cost and Fund Management \n \n16.  The  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  the  four  components  is \nCNY192.8849 million in latter half 2007 prices, including contingencies and land taxes, equivalent \nto $28.16 million.1 The city PMOs will fund land acquisition and resettlement costs, included as part \nof the total project cost. According to the compensation policies and standards defined in the \nresettlement plans, the payment and usage of compensation funds will be carried out under the \nsupervision of internal monitoring agencies, with regular audit review and regular review by the \nexternal monitoring agency. Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in the villages, small \nshops, and enterprises. The compensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with village \ncommittees, households, small business shops, and enterprises. On this basis, the final costs \nmight be adjusted. \n \nF.  Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievances \n \n17.  The affected persons have been informed about the key elements of land acquisition and \nresettlement through consultation during the planning stage and information disclosure sessions \nwith the affected persons, villages, and county governments during the project preparation stage. \nDuring  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and \ncommunity  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  participated  in  the  planning  and  their \nconcerns  were  integrated  into  the  resettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  information  booklet\u2014\nconfirming the project affected areas, implementation schedule and framework, compensation \nstandards for land acquisition and other assets, relocation assistance, livelihood rehabilitation \nstrategy, and dispute resolution procedures\u2014was distributed to affected persons at the end of \nJune  2008.  Draft  resettlement  plans  were  distributed  and  disclosed  to  the  affected  counties, \ntownships,  villages,  and  affected  persons  in  July.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy (2005), the final resettlement plans were posted on the ADB website prior \nto appraisal. The PMO will set up project resettlement agencies to supervise implementation, \ncontinue public consultations, monitor progress, and deal with grievances. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangement and Schedule \n \n18.  Xinjiang  PMO  and  city  PMOs  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  implementation  of \nresettlement.  Each  city/area  PMO  coordinates  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and \nreporting of land acquisition and resettlement. The IAs are Altay Construction Bureau for the Altay \ncomponent, Changji Urban and Rural Construction Commission for the Changji component, Hami \nConstruction Bureau for the Hami component, and Turpan Construction Bureau for the Turpan \ncomponent. IAs will take primary responsibility for the resettlement consultation, implementation, \nand timely delivery of entitlements. To ensure smooth implementation, staff in charge of land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  will  undertake  relevant  training  on  resettlement  implementation \norganized by Xinjiang PMO. The resettlement implementation schedule for four components has \nbeen prepared. No land acquisition or demolition shall start until resettlement plans are updated \nbased on detailed designs and approved by ADB. It is anticipated that land acquisition and house \ndemolition will start in 2009 and be completed by the end of 2013. \n \n                                                 \n1 Exchange rate: $1 = CNY6.85. \n ", "  Appendix 10  53 \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n19.  Internal and external monitoring of resettlement implementation will be conducted. Each city \nPMO will carry out internal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of \nthe resettlement plan. Xinjiang PMO and the city/area PMOs will engage an independent agency \nfor semiannual monitoring and annual evaluation for four components of land acquisition and \nresettlement  until  2  years  after  the  completion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The \nindependent  agency  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  progress  of  resettlement  implementation, \npayment, and dispute resolution. It will identify the impacts for affected persons on (i) whether they \nhave received the approved compensation and entitlements on time, and (ii) whether their living \nstandard and income level have been restored to pre-project status. A baseline survey will be \ncarried out before land acquisition and house demolition starts. External monitoring reports will be \nforwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Altay City, Changji City, Hami City, Kuytun City, and Turpan City ethnic minority \ndevelopment plans (EMDPs) ensure that ethnic minorities will benefit equitably from the Project \nand  that  any  negative  impacts  affecting  them  will  be  reduced  or  mitigated.  Provisions  to \nenhance the economic conditions of ethnic minorities have been integrated into the project \ndesign and project assurances. Compensation and livelihood restoration measures are included \nin the resettlement plans to ensure that ethnic minority households affected by land acquisition \nbenefit  equally  from  the  Project.  Government  policies  and  programs  for  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment further protect and enhance project benefits. The EMDPs are based on relevant \nlaws and regulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nB.  Project Descriptions \n \n2.  Generally, the project components in all five cities are the same. These include (i) road \nconstruction and associated infrastructure, and (ii) environmental sanitation facilities. There is \ngreater emphasis on environmental subcomponents in cities with the largest ethnic minority \npopulations. \n \nC.  Socioeconomic Profiles \n \n3.  As the PRC\u2019s largest autonomous region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) \nis a low-income region with a small population (20 million), of which 60.4% is composed of \nethnic minority groups. The Uygur are the largest of these groups constituting 45.9% of the \npopulation, and the Tartar the smallest constituting 0.1% of the population. Other significant \nethnic minority groups include the Kazakh (6.9%), and the Hui (4.4%).  \n \n4.  Altay City is located in the northern frontier region of Xinjiang and is the capital of Altay \nPrefecture.  In  2007,  the  population  was  228,700  and  of  these  65.0%  was  classified \nnonagricultural. Altay\u2019s population is made up of 26 nationalities, including Han, Kazakh, Uygur, \nHui, Mongolian, Xibo, Uzbek, Russian, Tartar, Manchu, and Daur. The minority population of \nAltay  is  39.19%  of  the  total  population.  In  January  2008,  there  were  4,716  households \nconsisting of 12,492 persons or 10.8% of the nonagricultural population of Altay city entitled to \nthe minimum standard of living (MSL) subsidy. The urban unemployment rate in Altay is about \n1.95%. In 2006, the annual per capita net income of the farmers and herders in Altay is \nCNY3,837. This is high compared to the Xinjiang Province average level of CNY2,737 and the \nannual disposable income of the urban residents in Altay of CNY10,539 compared to the \nautonomous regional average level of CNY9,120. \n \n5.  Changji is the capital of Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture and it is the satellite town of \nUrumqi, the provincial capital. The distance between these two cities is only 30 kilometers. The \ngross domestic product of Urumqi and Changji accounts for one-third of the regions\u2019 gross \ndomestic product. In December 2004, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region government (XUARG) \ndecided to combine Urumqi and Changji and implement the Urumqi and Changji economic \nintegration strategy. In 2006, Changji had 138,100 households consisting of 411,200 persons of \nwhom 70% were engaged in nonagricultural based activities. In 2006, the minority population \nwas 91,600 accounting for 22.28% of the total city population. The major ethnic minority group \nis the Hui, followed by the Kazakh, Uygur, Mongol, Manchu, Xibo, Russian, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, \n ", "  Appendix 11  55 \nTartar, Daur, and Tajik. There are 6,397 persons or 2.22% of nonagricultural persons entitled in \nthe MSL system for urban residents. In 2006, the income of urban residents was CNY8,740 per \ncapita, but the income of farmers and herders was lower at CNY6,059.  \n \n6.  Hami city is located in the eastern area of Xinjiang. It is the capital of Hami Prefecture \nand is famous for the Hami melon. In 2006, the total population of Hami was 420,500 and the \nnonagricultural population accounted for 68.3% of this total. Hami\u2019s population is made up of \n24 nationalities, including Uygur, Han, Kazakh, Manchu, Mongol, Xibo, Russian, Tajik, Daur, \nTartar, and Uzbek. The ethnic minority population accounted for 28.48% of the total population. \nIn 2006, Hami had 5,530 households constituting 11,182 persons or 4.08% of nonagricultural \npersons receiving MSL.  \n \n7.  Kuytun is a city in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and is located in the center of the \n\u201cGolden Triangle\u201d of the Tianshan Mountain Northern Slope economic belt. In 2006, the total \npopulation of Kuytun was 305,500 and the nonagricultural population accounted for 96.5% of \nthis total. Kuytun\u2019s population is made up of 30 nationalities, the main ethnic minority being the \nHui followed by Kazakh, Xibo, Uzbek, Manchu, Mongol, Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Daur. The ethnic \nminority population accounted for 7.27% of the total population. In 2007, Kuytun had 890 \nhouseholds constituting 2,203 persons or 1.57% of nonagricultural beneficiaries receiving MSL. \nIn 2006, the annual urban resident disposable income was CNY8,148 per capita and the annual \nnet income of farmers and herders was CNY2,903 per capita. The registered unemployment \nrate in Kuytun was below 3.9%. \n \n8.  Turpan city is the capital of Turpan Prefecture. It was a traditional destination on the Silk \nRoad and today the prefecture has become an important tourism site and a priority development \narea for Xinjiang.  In 2007, the visitors to Turpan numbered 4.04 million and they generated a \ntotal of CNY0.78 billion in tourism revenue. In 2006, the population was 263,200 of whom 32% \nwas classified nonagricultural. Turpan\u2019s population is made up of 29 nationalities, with the Uygur \nconstituting 71% of the total population followed by the Hui, Manchu, Mongol, Russian, Xibo, \nUzbek, and Daur. The ethnic minority population accounts for 78.7% of the total population. The \nannual urban resident disposable income was CNY7,068 per capita and the annual net income \nof  farmers  and  horticulturalists  was  CNY3,777  per  capita.  There  are  2,170  households \nconstituting 5,164 persons or 6.7% of the nonagricultural population of Turpan city who are \nentitled to the MSL subsidy. \n \nD.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n9.  The EMDPs ensure that (i) ethnic minority people are given opportunities to participate \nin all stages and receive the benefits of the Project, and (ii) the strategies developed to mitigate \nagainst  negative  impacts  are  sensitive  to  the  culture  of  affected  minority  groups.  Project \nassurances address prioritization of ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups for employment \nopportunities. The skills and language training will help ensure sustainability of incomes and \nlivelihoods. \n \n10.  The social and poverty assessment indicates that the overall positive impacts of the \nProject  (improved  mobility  and  access,  sanitation,  and  environmental  protection)  on  ethnic \nminorities will be the same as on the Han population. However, in relation to the development of \nthe tourism industry, ethnic minorities will be the major beneficiaries, especially in Altay, Hami, \nand Turpan. Impacts are expected to be gender neutral, with men and women benefiting from \ntemporary job creation; and women from reduced domestic and care work, opportunities for \nincome generation from tourism growth, and project related business initiatives.  \n ", "56  Appendix 11 \n11.  The Project involves resettlement and relocation caused by demolition of houses and \nshops. Of the 117 affected households in Altay, 14% are ethnic minorities. In Changji, among \nthe total of 349 affected households, 48 households or 13.8% are ethnic minority households. In \nHami, of the 99 affected households, there are 65 ethnic minority households accounting for \n65.7% of affected households. In Turpan, of the 310 affected households, 304 households or \n98% of households are ethnic minority households. Of affected people requiring partial income \nrestoration, 15.7% of such households are ethnic minority households in Changji, 46.5% in \nHami, and 70.7% in Turpan. There are no land acquisition and resettlement impacts in Kuytun. \nThe resettlement plans for each of the four cities affected by resettlement and the environmental \nmanagement plan, outline strategies for mitigation of negative impacts that will be equally \napplicable  to  both  ethnic  minorities  and  Han  people.  In  cooperation  with  the  Civil  Affairs \nDepartment, the resettlement plans also outline special funds that have been established to \nprovide additional aid, including subsidies and medical care for vulnerable and ethnic minority \ngroups.  \n \n12.  The  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  agreed  to  the  assurances  obliging \ncontractors  to  employ  local  labor,  and  workers  from  ethnic  minorities  will  be  particularly \ntargeted.  Skills  training  in  construction,  language  training,  and  tourism  will  be  provided  in \ncoordination with other government and local stakeholders. Attention to ethnic minority cultural \nissues  will  be  addressed  through  awareness  building  with  workers  and  prohibitions  on \nconstruction  near  religious  sites  on  particular  days,  such  as  during  Friday  prayers  at  the \nmosque. Information and education activities on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV will be \nsupported by the Project and the Center for Disease Control in each city. The expansion of bus \nand taxi services will pay attention to ensuring that public transportation is available for the new \nrelocation sites and improved roads (predominantly ethnic minority areas). \n \nE.  Consultation and Disclosure  \n \n13.  During preparation, affected persons and ethnic minority populations living in the five \nproject cities were extensively consulted about the likely positive and negative impacts of the \nProject and participated in outlining actions to enhance positive outcomes. Other stakeholders \nconsulted include (i) heads of affected person households (excluding Kuytun), (ii) village heads \nand villagers\u2019 representatives, (iii) local government agencies and departments, and (iv) women \nand vulnerable groups. From March to May 2008, consultative meetings were held in the five \nproject cities and Urumqi to discuss and finalize the EMDPs. Upon ADB approval, the EMDPs \nwill  be  endorsed  and  disclosed  to  the  targeted  villages,  townships,  and  subdistricts  and \nuploaded  to  the  ADB  website.  The  participation  and  disclosure  plan  will  use  notices  and \nmeetings to deal with all aspects of the Project, such as notification of employment and training \nopportunities, land acquisition details, EMDP actions, and general information and feedback \nsessions. During the project implementation period, the PMOs will encourage affected persons \nto participate in additional resettlement activities such as skills training. Ethnic minorities will \nparticipate in the formulation of compensation standards and relocation plans. To resolve any \ngrievances and ensure smooth construction and project implementation, a clear, transparent, \nand efficient complaint and appeals channel with redress mechanisms has been outlined. This \nwill be the same for grievances arising from both resettlement plan and EMDP implementation. \nMonitoring indicators related to participation and feedback have been incorporated into the plan. \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  57 \nF.  Implementation/Institutional Arrangements \n \n14.  The  city  government  and  implementing  agency  (IA)  in  each  project  city  will  be \nresponsible for implementing the EMDP. The Ethnic Affairs Bureau will provide support to \ncoordinate, advise, and monitor implementation progress. Implementation arrangements for the \nEMDPs have been integrated into project management, or are part of ongoing government \nprograms. Other key agencies include the Center for Disease Control, Civil Affairs Bureau, \nLabor and Social Security Bureau, and the All-China Women\u2019s Federation. The Ethnic Affairs \nBureau will provide oversight and review of external monitoring, evaluation reports, and provide \nrecommendations.  Township  governments  and  subdistrict  offices  will  assign  staff  for \nimplementation  and  coordination.  The  IA  will  have  a  member  responsible  for  EMDP \nimplementation.  \n \nG.  Budgeting and Financing Sources \n \n15.  The EMDP activities will not require a separate budget. The actions are either included \nas (i) part of the project budgets, or (ii) part of local government development budgets. Local \ngovernment agencies will collaborate with the Executing Agency and city government, while \nlocal government budgets cover their staffing and related costs. Project actions are cost under \nthe resettlement plans and project contracts.  \n \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n16.  Regular  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  EMDPs  will  ensure  that  the  plans  are \nimplemented properly. Objectives of the monitoring and evaluation plans with respect to ethnic \nminorities will be (i) to collect data and information to identify project impacts based on the \ndevelopment monitoring framework in the social and poverty assessment and the monitoring \nframeworks  for  resettlement,  including  qualitative  information  to  describe  social  or  poverty \nchanges  on  ethnic  minorities  and  their  communities;  and  (ii)  to  ensure  that  appropriate \napproaches have been adopted and the goals have been achieved. The city government and \nexecuting agency in each city will undertake internal monitoring. Independent organizations will \nbe hired for each area in conjunction with the resettlement plan external monitoring agency to \nprovide  independent  advice  on  progress,  impacts,  and  outcomes.  Terms  of  reference  for \nexternal  monitoring  are  appended  to  the  EMDPs.  The  project  component  in  five  cities  is \nscheduled to commence in 2009 and finish in 2013. \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  Financial analysis has been prepared in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.1 Financial analysis \nwas carried out to ensure fiscal sustainability of the project components by analyzing city \ngovernment finances of Altay city government, Changji city government, Hami city government, \nKuytun city government, and Turpan city government.  \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Non-Revenue Generating Components \n \n2.  The  historical  financial  performance  of  the  city  governments  has  been  analyzed  to \ndetermine whether they can provide the required counterpart funds during the construction \nperiod and necessary funds for operation and maintenance (O&M) and debt service during the \noperating period. In addition, annual average growth rates of revenues and expenditures during \nthe project period are calculated. The average income growth rate ranged from 11% to 12% per \nyear.  The  same  growth  rates  are  used  in  projecting  the  revenues  of  the  cities  during \nimplementation of the Project. The sources of income of these cities are from tax and nontax \nrevenues and from subsidies and/or direct transfers from the provincial prefectures and the \nregional governments. Kuytun registered surplus for the period 2003 and 2004. Altay, Changji, \nHami, and Turpan over the last 5 years did not register any surplus funds; their incomes are just \nenough to sustain their operations. Altay and Turpan have been very dependent on transfers \nfrom the regional government. The transfers and subsidies to the city budgets are in Table \nA.12.1. Their internally generated funds from tax and nontax resources are not sufficient to \ncover recurring costs. It is recommended that assurance be sought for additional transfer from \nthe national budget to support the provision of counterpart funds during implementation of the \nProject.   \n \nTable A12.1: Financial Performance Assessment Results \n(%) \n  Changji    Kuytun  Turpan \nAltay City  City  Hami City  City  City \n Item \nAnnual Income Growth  11  11  12  11  12 \nTax and Nontax Revenues  22  84  68  89  59 \nSubsidies and Transfers  78  16  32  11  41 \n   Source: Asian Development Bank.   \n \nC.  Fiscal Impact Assessment \n \n3.  Financial sustainability of the components during both the implementation and operation \nphase has been determined. The fiscal impact assessment of the implementing agencies (IAs) \nhas been assessed by comparing annual collections from the identified financing sources with \nthe annual counterpart funds required for (i) capital expenditures during project implementation, \nand (ii) recurrent costs for O&M and debt services of the project components during operation. \nInterest and principal repayments for the ADB loan are estimated based on a grace period of \n5 years and a maturity of 20 years.

Altay  city  government  will  provide  about  $17.3  million  in  counterpart  funds  during \nimplementation and $1.6 million per year during operation. Changji city government will provide \nabout $25.7 million in counterpart funds during implementation and $2.2 million per year during \noperation. Hami city government will provide about $10.1 million in counterpart funds during \nimplementation and $0.8 million per year during operation. Kuytun city government will provide \nabout $15.3 million in counterpart funds during implementation and $1.3 million per year during \noperation. Turpan city government will provide about $18.8 million in counterpart funds during \nimplementation and $1.5 million per year during operation. Assessment of projected annual \nrevenues  shows  that  each  IA  has  the  necessary  counterpart  funds  for  its  respective \ncomponents.  \n \n5.  The  analysis  indicates  that  based  on  the  identified  fund  sources  during  project \npreparation  (including  new  budgets,  subsidies,  and  allocation  that  will  be  earmarked),  all \ncomponents should have sufficient funds available for counterpart funds during implementation \nand O&M costs and debt service during operation period. Estimated annual forecasted debt \nservice and O&M costs are found to be about 2% of the city budget annual revenues. This \nindicates acceptable fiscal risk since it is expected that fiscal revenues of the city governments \nwill grow in line with economic development, providing more mobility for the city governments to \nfinance proposed project components.

Details of \nthe financial management assessment are in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n \n7.  The questionnaire was administered to the finance departments of XUARG and the city \ngovernments. It has determined the accounting and financial capacity needs during project \nimplementation and operations after project completion. The assessment of XUARG\u2019s previous \nexperience  in  managing  foreign-assisted  projects  confirms  that  its  financial  management \npractices are adequate for implementation of the Project. XUARG is currently implementing an \nADB-financed project and has adequate capacity and experience to implement this Project. In \nthe  case  of  the  IAs,  each  city  will  be  assisted  to  establish  a  sound  and  solid  financial \nmanagement system at the beginning of project implementation. Each city will keep accounts in \naccordance with the PRC\u2019s accounting standards and subject to independent external audit by \nsuitably qualified commercial or government auditors. Accounting will be in accordance with \nrelevant PRC national accounting standards. All IAs will meet ADB requirements for auditing \narrangements and submit audited financial statements to ADB annually. A capacity building \ncomponent to strengthen financial management has been included in the Project. \n \n8.  The IAs have adequate procedures in managing and safeguarding their assets. All IAs\u2019 \nsubsidiary ledgers of fixed assets and inventories are well maintained. Office buildings and \nother fixed assets are provided with insurance coverage. Physical inventories of fixed assets are \nconducted periodically. The IAs have effective asset management systems in place and are \nfound to be generally satisfactory. \n \n9.  The overall financial management arrangements of the IAs are generally satisfactory \nand reliable. ADB\u2019s financial due diligence requirements, especially the audit and reporting \nrequirements, will be particularly emphasized to the IAs. The IAs\u2019 staff concerned will be trained \nin ADB loan processing and policies and related procedures for procurement and disbursement, \namong others. Staff will undergo training in project management and relevant ADB procedures \nduring implementation of the Project. With the help of international and national consultants, \ncapacity will be strengthened in (i) project financial management, accounting, and business \nplanning; and (ii) management information system and cost management and control. The \nrespective IAs will establish a well-staffed project management office. The IAs will be required to \nmaintain  a  separate  book  of  accounts  specifically  for  the  Project  to  ensure  that  project \nconstruction and management activities can be accounted for separately. This will facilitate the \npreparation of the financial reports required to be submitted to ADB annually during the duration \nof the Project.    \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  61 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The economic analysis covers five components of the Project. For the overall Project, the \nanalysis covers (i) economic rationale for public intervention, (ii) the goals of the investment plan, \nand (iii) the design of the plan. The economic analysis also evaluates the components relative to \nleast-cost analysis criteria and standard benefit-cost analysis. Economic analysis was conducted \nin accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines for Economic Analysis of \nProjects (2001). The detailed economic analysis and least-cost analysis are in Supplementary \nAppendix L. \nB.  Analysis of the Overall Project \n2.  Rationale for Public Intervention. The primary motivation for the Project results from the \nincreasing concern over the effects of population growth and economic growth on the inadequacy \nof public services in the cities of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). Continuing \nurbanization has resulted in increasing demand for private cars, changes in lifestyle that create a \nmore diversified range of travel demands, and changes in urban land use patterns that are \nincreasingly dependent on motorized transport. This contributes to major deficiencies in urban \nroad networks and services. Furthermore, urban areas face environmental threats from pollution \nof surface and subsurface waters from untreated garbage. In 2006, the urban population in \nXinjiang accounted for about 37% of the total population. This is expected to increase to 42% by \n2010 and 47% by 2015. \n \n3.  The  strategic  location  of  Xinjiang  as  a  major  transport  corridor  and  as  the  gateway \nbetween the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Central Asian countries1 is expected to spur \neconomic development and contribute to tourism development. The region is also rich in natural \nresources  including  oil,  metals,  and  minerals,  which  provide  a  sound  basis  for  economic \ndevelopment. With the expected rise in trade and tourism brought about by cooperation activities \nunder the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program, development of necessary \ninfrastructure support facilities is critical to sustained economic growth and development. \n \n4  Poor condition of urban roads and solid waste management demonstrate the need for \ngovernment investments. The private sector, which is a victim of poor roads and solid waste \nmanagement,  does  not  possess  sufficient  investment  resources  to  solve  the  problems  and \nimprove the quality of urban infrastructure and services. Therefore, government intervention is \neconomically sound and justified.  The Government has a role in controlling negative externalities \nfrom untreated waste and coordinating the management of urban roads. It has a role in promoting \nurban  development  in  a  more  coordinated  manner  and  integrating  both  government  and \nbeneficiary efforts in bringing more sustainable investments in physical infrastructure. Since the \noutput of the proposed projects cannot be reasonably be sold, local government departments will \nbe the managers and maintainers. However, contracting operations and maintenance of urban \nroads and solid waste management to the private sector is encouraged. \n \n5.  The Project involves government intervention at several different levels. The Xinjiang \nUygur Autonomous Region government (XUARG) is promoting development in the cities in a \nmore coordinated and cost-effective manner by bringing about more sustainable investments in \nphysical  and  environmental  protection  infrastructure  that  aim  to  improve  the  quality  of  life. \nInvolvement of the XUARG is justified since the development program spans several prefectures \n                                                 \n1  The Second Eurasia Continental Bridge railway line connects Europe to East Asia through the Xinjiang Uygur \nAutonomous Region. \n ", "62   Appendix 13 \n \nand cities. The city governments are coordinating and implementing the elements of urban road \nmaster plans and making individual investments in roads and environmental sanitation. They will \nalso be involved in owning and managing the completed facilities. The Government has a role in \npromoting urban development in a more coordinated manner and integrating both government \nand beneficiary efforts in bringing about more sustainable investments in physical infrastructure. \nGovernment involvement in individual projects is justified since both solid waste management and \nurban roads are natural monopolies. City governments through the construction bureau manage \nurban roads, sanitation, and other essential public utilities and services in the towns.  \n \n6.  Goals of the Investment Plan. The Project is a direct response to Xinjiang\u2019s 11th Five-\nYear Plan (11FYP) to promote sustainable economic development, particularly in its cities, via \nconstruction and upgrading of roads infrastructure while protecting the environment. The 11FYP \nrecognizes that achieving these goals will require the improvement of basic municipal services \nand environmental quality in these areas. All subcomponents in the proposed Project are integral \ncomponents of the 11FYP. City governments are required to make investments in roads and \nenvironmental sanitation. The city and area government master plans are reasonably sound and \nare integrated with the overall planning process. \n \nC.  Traffic Analysis and Projections \n7.  In Changji City, the existing traffic was determined using travel demand volumes and \npatterns. The traffic volume was based on existing travel patterns, population, and the proposed \nland use of the road\u2019s zone of influence. The demand model contains some form of mathematical \nrelationships that relate travel demand with external factors such as population and land use. \nSince a complete dataset of travel demand patterns and behavioral parameters fundamental to \nthe accurate description of the existing situation is very costly to obtain (e.g., origin\u2013destination \nmovements of travelers are difficult to obtain without interviewing), the demand forecasting model \nrelies on estimation techniques and professional judgment for the development of the base year \nmodel to represent the existing situation. The model area was set (zone A and zone B). The zone \nencompasses the area over which all the economic benefits and costs of the Project will be felt. \nThe model was segmented to reflect the characteristics of the area\u2019s zone of influence as follows: \n(i) peak hours since travel time varies significantly between morning peak hour and evening peak \nhour; and (ii) vehicle classes were differentiated within the model, such as cars, trucks, and \nbuses. Traffic forecast was determined based on socioeconomic trends that took into account \nchanges in variables such as gross domestic product, population, and vehicle ownership. The \nforecast gross domestic product growth rates were applied to the calibrated base year matrices to \nproduce passenger and freight vehicle flows. \n8.  The other cities\u2019 traffic analyses were performed in terms of (i) selecting and defining \nvehicle type\u2019s representative, (ii) assessing annual average daily traffic, and (iii) forecasting \ndemand. A vehicle fleet consists of a mix of several vehicle types that use a road network. The \ntraffic survey serves as the basis for determining average annual daily traffic. To establish the \naverage annual daily traffic from the average daily traffic, seasonal variations were assessed \ntaking into account the main factors driving changes in traffic patterns, such as the rainy season, \nwinter, and tourist season. Winter has a direct impact on traffic patterns. Heavy snowfall can \ncause frequent road closures. Traffic forecast is composed of (i) growth for normal traffic, which \ncorresponds  to  the  growth  that  would  occur  even  without  improving  the  road  network;  and \n(ii) generated traffic, which occurs only in cases where there is a significant improvement in the \nroad network. In both cases, traffic projections also took into account potential generated traffic. \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  63 \nD.  Evaluation of Individual Components \n9.  The least-cost analysis ensures that each subproject is optimally designed to meet the \ngoals of the Project and does not involve unnecessary extra costs. The least-cost analysis has \ncovered all feasible alternatives for a given component, including variations in technology and \nlocation. Each subproject has been designed at least cost in terms of location, scale (planning \nhorizon), and technology. Detailed evaluation of options has been undertaken to meet the least-\ncost criterion. The present value of economic cost approach has been adopted for the roads, \nincluding environmental sanitation. The analysis uses a simplified approach based on annualized \ncapital, operation, maintenance, and management costs; and an economic opportunity cost of \ncapital of 12%. Detailed calculation and discussion of the cost-effectiveness analysis is presented \nin Supplementary Appendix L. \n10.  In addition to being part of the 11FYP, each component is economically justified on its \nown. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) have been estimated for each road subproject. \nThe EIRRs are compared with the economic opportunity cost of capital, which is assumed to be \n12%. Major benefits that have been quantified for the roads include the following: (i) savings in \nvehicle operating costs resulting from reduced travel distance and improved road conditions, \n(ii) savings resulting from fewer accidents, (iii) reduced maintenance costs, (iv) savings in the \nvalue of passengers\u2019 time and of freight tied up in transit, and (v) generated traffic resulting from \nreduced transportation costs. \n11.  The economic analysis has been conducted over 25 years, including project construction. \nEconomic benefits and costs are denominated in domestic price numeraire at constant mid-2008 \nprices. Foreign currency costs have been converted into local currency costs using the exchange \nrate of CNY6.85 per $1 and adjusted based on purchasing power parity assumption. Project \ntradable components have been adjusted to economic prices using a shadow exchange rate \nfactor of 1.013 and non-tradable components valued at domestic market prices. Project costs and \nbenefits have been estimated on a without-project and with-project basis. Transfer payments \nhave been excluded in the valuation of cost estimates in economic prices. The financial prices of \nthe different components of volatile organic compounds (such as fuel, lubricants, tires, vehicle \nmaintenance cost, driver/crew cost) have been adjusted to economic prices using appropriate \nconversion factors: 1.013 for tradable and 1.0 for non-tradable. A shadow wage conversion factor \nof 0.67 is applied for all types of work time for vehicle maintenance labor and vehicle operator \nlabor and 1.0 for nonworking time. The shadow coefficient used for budget transfers such as \ntaxes and subsidies is zero. Passenger time savings are divided into working and leisure. Leisure \ntime is assumed at 30% of work time. Passenger working time is adjusted by the shadow wage \nrate factor of 0.67 and the nonworking time by a conversion factor of 1.0. Standard sensitivity \ntests, and additional tests for a 1-year implementation delay and 20% increase in operation and \nmaintenance costs, have been conducted. \n12.  The economic costs include (i) the capital cost, including physical contingencies, land \nacquisition, resettlement, environmental monitoring, and mitigation costs; and (ii) the cost of \noperation and maintenance, including the cost of replacement of depreciated equipment. The \nland acquisition and resettlement costs have been based on their opportunity costs, that is, the \nagricultural output forgone and the re-siting of displaced economic activities.2 Residual values, if \nany, have been treated as negative costs at the end of the project life. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  The economic opportunity costs of land have been assumed to be equivalent to the replacement value of farmland, \nwhich has been calculated for land compensation. \n ", "64   Appendix 13 \n \nE.
