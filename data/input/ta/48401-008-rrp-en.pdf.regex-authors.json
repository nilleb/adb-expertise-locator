THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the additional financing of the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Corridors 1 and 3 Connector Road Project \n(Phase 2).1 \n \n2.  Weak domestic and regional connectivity has hindered the development of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and limited economic and inclusive growth of the urban and rural population. To address \nthis issue, in 2016, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the financing of the CAREC \nCorridors 1 and 3 Connector Road Project costing $114.35 million.2 The project connects two \nmajor CAREC regional corridors by rehabilitating a crucial connector road, part of the North\u2013\nSouth Alternate Corridor linking Balykchy with Jalal-Abad. The project will (i) improve connectivity \nand  mobility,  (ii)  link  economically  underprivileged  regions  with  economic  hubs,  and  \n(iii) strengthen institutional capacity. Consistent with the current project, the additional financing \nwill rehabilitate the missing sections of the North\u2013South Alternate Corridor, and continue the \nongoing efforts to strengthen institutional capacity of the Ministry of Transport and Roads (MOTR). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In 2018, the government approved its medium-term development program\u2014Unity, Trust, \nCreation\u2014covering 2018\u20132022, which prioritizes construction and expansion of the network of \nhighways  and  international  transport  corridors  to  improve  connectivity.3 The  development \nprogram prioritizes the construction of the North\u2013South Alternate Corridor. Development of \ntransport and road infrastructure under the CAREC Program is a priority area identified by the \n2018\u20132022 development program. The government is focusing on rehabilitation and maintenance \nof international transport corridors to promote movement of cargo and passengers, and increase \naccess to regional economic centers. \n \n4.  Being a landlocked country, the Kyrgyz Republic depends heavily on road transport. The \nroad network caters to 58% of cargo and 78% of passenger traffic. Of the country\u2019s 34,000-\nkilometer (km) road network, international road corridors comprise 2,654 km. About 69% of the \ninternational corridors have been rehabilitated, with the remainder in the process of rehabilitation. \nThe government plans to expand the size of the international road corridor network to 3,248 km \nby 2025.4 Besides expanding the network, the government aims to allocate more funds for road \nmaintenance, and improve its road asset management system. \n  \n5.   The CAREC Corridors 1 and 3 Connector Road (connector road) linking Balykchy with \nBashkugandy forms part of the North\u2013South Alternate Corridor and will improve national and \nregional connectivity in the center of the Kyrgyz Republic. Besides linking the two CAREC \ncorridors, it contributes to enhancing the connectivity between the southern regions (Jalal-Abad \nand Osh) and the northern regions (Chui and Issyk-Kul) through a more efficient alternative route, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2016.

Development Program of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132022: Unity, Trust, \nCreation. Bishkek. \n4  Road subsector-related figures sourced from Government of the Kyrgyz Republic - Ministry of Transport and Roads; \nand National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic. ", "2 \nimproving access to international markets.5 The project will also support the government\u2019s road \nsector reform agenda and assist the government in improving its road asset management system \n(RAMS) and road safety. \n \n6.  The rehabilitation of the connector road is consistent with the government\u2019s priority, as \nstated in its medium-term strategy (footnote 3). It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy (CPS) for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132022,  and Strategy 2030; and is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132020. 6 \n \n7.  Based on the government\u2019s request, ADB approved the concept paper of the CAREC \nCorridors 1 and 3 Connector Road Project on 22 April 2015.7 The concept paper included the \napproval of transaction technical assistance (TA) of $1 million. In parallel, ADB approved a $3 \nmillion grant for the project design advance (PDA) financing for the CAREC Corridors 1 and 3 \nConnector Road Project on 2 June 2015. The PDA was used to finance a detailed design \nconsultant for ADB-financed sections. The PDA grant agreement was signed by ADB and the \ngovernment on 15 June 2015 and became effective on 25 January 2016. The detailed design \nconsultant was mobilized in February 2016. On 27 September 2016, ADB approved a loan and a \ngrant for the CAREC Corridors 1 and 3 Connector Road Project (the current project), which is \nphase 1 of the connector road (footnote 2). The financing agreement was signed on 2 December \n2016 and became effective on 23 May 2017. The PDA was integrated into the current project \nwhen the financing agreement became effective. \n \n8.  Because of limited funding, it was not possible to finance all sections studied under the \ncurrent  project.  The  current  project  included  only  one  section  of  70  km  (Epkin  village  to \nBashkugandy village) for rehabilitation along with soft components comprising preparation and \nimplementation of the RAMS, and review of pilot performance-based maintenance contracting. \n \n9.  The rehabilitation of two other road sections totaling 68 km (Balykchy\u2013km marker [Km] 43 \nand Kochkor\u2013Epkin) was proposed to be considered for approval as additional financing under \nthe subsequent phase 2 of the connector road project. All project documents related to the two \nsections under phase 2 were prepared and reviewed under the transaction TA and then the PDA. \nThe PDA consultant is responsible for assisting the government in procuring the contracts and \nupdating the safeguards documents. \n \n10.  Besides  ADB,  other  development  partners  are  supporting  the  rehabilitation  of  the \nconnector  road.  Financing  from  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  and  the  Saudi  Fund  for \nDevelopment was used for rehabilitating 24 km of the Bashkugandy\u2013Kyzyl Jyldyz section. A \nEurasian Development Bank loan will rehabilitate the 91 km road linking Aral with CAREC \nCorridor 3. Export-Import Bank of China is financing the rehabilitation of 250 km of the Kyzyl \nJyldyz to Jalal-Abad section. Construction works are currently ongoing. \n \n11.  Implementation status of the current project. The civil works contract for the current \nproject, the Epkin\u2013Bashkugandy section, was awarded in September 2018 and mobilization \nworks will begin in November 2018. The delay in procurement was caused by the protracted bid \n                                                \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  ADB. 2018.

The government will decide on the use of loan savings after sufficient physical \nprogress is achieved. The consultancy contract for the RAMS was awarded in August 2018. \n \n12.  Safeguards compliance. The land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP), updated \nbased on detailed design for the current project, was cleared and disclosed by ADB on its website \nin July 2018. The government is committed to implementing the LARP before the start of the \nconstruction activities on any specific road section. The initial environmental examination (IEE) \nreport, also updated based on the detailed design, was cleared and disclosed by ADB on its \nwebsite in June 2018. \n \n13.  Project performance. The current project performance rating is on track. With the award \nof  the  RAMS  consulting  contract,  the  achievement  of  contract  awards  improved.  Project \nperformance parameters\u2014delivery of outputs, compliance with safeguards policy requirements, \nand management of risks\u2014are satisfactory. Although the loan and grant were made effective in \nlate  May  2017,  the  civil  works  contract  was  awarded  in  September  2018.  Disbursement \nperformance will improve after the start of physical works. Risk mitigation measures related to \nefficient implementation of the project include (i) delegation of the project to KYRM to ensure \nclose and frequent monitoring of the physical progress; (ii) monthly reporting by the supervision \nengineer  of  the  construction  progress,  identifying  issues  and  solutions;  and  (iii)  periodic \nmonitoring by ADB of the key milestones to ensure that the project is completed by July 2021, as \nscheduled. \n \n14.  Eligibility of additional financing. The justification for additional financing is to scale up \nthe project, which is consistent with the approval of the current project. The two new sections \nincluded  in  phase  2  are  contiguous  with  the  current  project  section.  The  project  remains \ntechnically, economically, and financially viable. The development objectives remain unchanged \nwith the additional financing. The project is accorded high priority by the government (para. 3), \nand is consistent with the CPS (para. 6). The project has a high degree of readiness. The current \nproject is performing well, as stipulated in ADB\u2019s Operations Manual.8 As such, the additional \nfinancing meets other eligibility criteria in ADB\u2019s additional financing policy. \n \n15.  Value added by ADB assistance. The following features provide ADB value addition: \n(i)  Project design and innovation. ADB\u2019s intervention initiated an innovative design \nfeature  of  combining  road  rehabilitation  with  performance-based  road \nmaintenance by customizing ADB\u2019s existing standard bidding documents. \n(ii)  Institutional development. Besides the RAMS, ADB will continue road safety \ninterventions intended to improve the institutional framework for conducting road \nsafety audits. \n(iii)  Climate  change  resilience.  The  road  design  incorporates  climate  change \nadaptation mechanisms that will lead to enhanced climate change resilience. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  enhanced  regional  and  national \nconnectivity (footnote 3). The project will have the following outcome: improved efficiency and \n                                                \n8  A president\u2019s waiver was sought in respect of the following: \u201cWhile projects may experience problems, these should \nhave been addressed and the project should be performing well for at least 12 months before the cross-departmental \ncirculation of the report and recommendation of the President.\u201d ADB. 2011.

Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The MOTR will be the executing agency. It has implemented all development partner-\nfinanced  road  projects  in  Kyrgyz  Republic  since  1995,  and  has  accumulated  considerable \nexperience. The project implementation unit - Investment Projects Implementation Group (IPIG) \nwill be responsible for project implementation activities. Construction supervision consultants will \nbe engaged as the engineer for the construction contract. Road safety consultants will be \nrecruited by the MOTR to provide advice on road safety reforms, road safety engineering, road \nsafety campaign, and capacity strengthening. Additional scope of the RAMS will be decided \npending the results of the current project\u2019s RAMS development. \n \n22.  The government requested ADB\u2019s approval for importing bitumen under the two civil works \ncontracts of phase 2 (additional financing) from the Russian Federation, a nonmember country of \nADB. Because of climate conditions in the Kyrgyz Republic, bitumen required for construction \nshould be able to endure extreme weather conditions. Bitumen from neighboring ADB member \ncountries often cannot meet the quality requirements and is subjected to unreliable supply of \nconsistent quality. Allowing bitumen produced in the Russian Federation to be used for road \n ", "6 \nconstruction  works  would  result  in  better  quality  road  pavement  requiring  relatively  lower \nmaintenance costs during operation, compared with using bitumen from neighboring member \ncountries. Therefore, to maximize the project\u2019s development impact, economic efficiency, and \nquality assurance, a waiver to allow procurement of bitumen from the Russian Federation is \nrequested from the ADB Board of Directors.11 \n \n23.  The implementation arrangements have not changed, as summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).12 The functioning of IPIG has been \nimproved as part of the MOTR\u2019s reform, as a result of which IPIG has separate units handling \ndifferent development partner projects. The proposed additional financing for phase 2 will require \nnew civil works procurement for the two added sections. Likewise, one additional supervision \nconsulting firm will need to be recruited; however, one firm can manage supervision for both phase \n2 sections. Road safety components have been added to the additional financing as per the \nrequest of the government and the National Road Safety Conference held in 2017. The RAMS \nmay need to be expanded to include more sections of road in the country, and legislative and \ncapacity support; this will be carried out either by a new firm or the existing firm. The same \nfinancial audit firm will carry out financial audits for the current and additional financing scope. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 December 2018\u201331 July 2027 \nEstimated project  31 July 2027 \ncompletion date \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2027 (loan and grant closing date) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Ministry of Finance, deputy minister (chair) \nHead of Public Investment Program, Technical Assistance, and Foreign Aid \nDepartment; and head of Investment Projects Implementation Division (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Transport and Roads \n(iii) Key implementing  Investment Projects Implementation Group \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit  Bishkek, 20 staff \nProcurement  International competitive  Current project: 1 civil works  $72.00 million \nbidding using ADB\u2019s  contract   \nProcurement Guidelines (2015,     \nas amended from time to time)  Additional financing: 2 civil  $53.54 million \nworks contracts \nConsulting services  Recruitment of Consulting Firm  Current project:    \nusing Quality- and cost-based  1 construction supervision (301  $3.26 million \nselection using ADB\u2019s  person-months)   \nGuidelines on the Use of  1 road asset management (191  $2.41 million \nConsultants (2013, as amended  person-months) \nfrom time to time) \n  Additional financing:    \n1 construction supervision (486  $5.4 million \nperson-months)   \n1 road safety (200 person- $1.8 million \nmonths)   \n1 RAMS (100 person-months)  $1.67 million \nLeast-cost selection using  Current project: Financial audit  $0.10 million \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of  Additional financing: Financial  $0.10 million \nConsultants   audit \n                                                \n11 The ADB Board of Directors must approve the waiver by a vote representing not less than two-thirds of the total \nvoting power of the members of the Board. \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndividual consultants using  Current project: Project  $1.57 million \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on Use of  management (1,080 person-  \nConsultants (2013, as amended  months)   \nfrom time to time)   2 performance-based  $0.34 million \nmaintenance contract   \nspecialists (18 person-months)   \nAdditional financing: Project  $1.2 million \nmanagement (900 person-\nmonths) \nAdvance contracting  The following items of expenditure are being proposed for advance contracting: civil \nworks, construction supervision consultant, and RAMS consulting services.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  For the two sections to be financed by additional financing (phase 2), preliminary design \ndetails, cost estimates, and economic assessments were prepared during the initial TA stage. \nDetailed design and bid documents were prepared subsequently by PDA consultants. Using \ncontemporary geometric design standards, the detailed designs have been prepared for a two-\nlane road (four lanes in the first part of section 1 and in all the village areas) featuring 3.75-meter \n(m) traffic lanes with adjacent shoulders featuring a configuration of 0.75 m paved and 3.00 m \nunpaved. This is considered appropriate based on the forecast future traffic demand. The project \nplans to use materials recycled from the existing roadbed as part of the fill, including the old \nasphalt surfacing that could present environmental concerns if moved to off-site disposal areas. \nCivil works rehabilitation will also cover improvement of the bridges. To address concerns over \nincreased traffic volumes and operating speeds, road safety measures have been introduced into \nthe detailed design following audits by design team specialists. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  Economic  assessment.  Economic  assessment  conducted  during  preparation  and \nprocessing of the current project included the two new sections under phase 2. This analysis is \nan extension to that conducted for the current project (footnote 2) with a focus on those sections \nto be rehabilitated under the additional financing (sections 1 and 2A). The analysis applied  \n(i) investment costs based on the updated detailed design and (ii) baseline traffic and the traffic \nforecast based on traffic counts conducted on those sections in June 2017. All other aspects of \nthe economic analysis remain the same. The project will lower transport costs, and increase travel \nspeeds and time savings. The project\u2019s economic evaluation was undertaken using the highway \ndevelopment  and  management  model13 and  following  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Economic \nAnalysis  of  Projects.14 The results  indicate that the  project  is  economically  viable  with  an \neconomic internal rate of return of 22.8%. The high economic internal rate of return reflects high \ntraffic volumes and the poor state of the roads without the project. Sensitivity tests confirmed that \nthe project would remain viable even if the envisaged project costs increase or benefits decrease. \n                                                \n13 The model is a software package managed by HDMGlobal (www.hdmglobal.com). \n14 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \n26.  Financial sustainability. The costs related to operation and maintenance of the road will \ndecrease after construction because the road condition will be improved. Besides implementation \nof the RAMS, the proposed additional financing includes introduction of a hybrid construction and \nperformance-based road maintenance contract for the Balykchy\u2013Km 43 and the Kochkor\u2013Epkin \nroad sections. This will cover routine and periodic maintenance after the construction work. After \nthe completion of the contract, the government is expected to continue the performance-based \nroad maintenance system and allocate sufficient funds from the general budget. \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  Institutional capacity. The IPIG has been implementing ADB-funded projects since 1996 \nand has delivered 11 ADB road projects with a total cost of more than $601 million. IPIG staff \nhave adequate knowledge and understanding of, and experience with, ADB procedures to \nmanage the project. \n \n28.  Financial  management.  The  IPIG\u2019s  capacity  for  project  financial  accounting  is \nsatisfactory, and it has a proven track record with ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures. Separate \nproject records and accounts will be maintained. The project accounts and related financial \nstatements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  national  and  international  auditing \nstandards. The pre-mitigation risk rating assigned to the project is substantial based on the \nassessment  of  the  existing  financial  management  arrangements,  including  budgeting  and \nplanning,  accounting  and  reporting,  internal  controls,  and  functioning  of  the  accounting \ninformation system. Mitigation measures include (i) stricter monitoring of compliance with audit \nobservations,  (ii)  strengthening  of  financial  management  staffing  in  the  IPIG,  and  (iii) \nstrengthening of internal audit functions in the IPIG. Project sustainability has been identified as \na key risk, and will be mitigated through sector reform, implementation of performance-based \nroad maintenance, and the implementation of the RAMS. \n  \n29.  Procurement. The project procurement risk classification is moderate. Besides closer \nmonitoring by ADB, the mitigation measures include mobilization of an experienced international \nprocurement specialist to support the MOTR to assist in preparing the procurement documents \nand in bid evaluation. The invitation for bids for the additional financing sections (Balykchy\u2013Km \n43 and the Kochkor\u2013Epkin road sections) will be advertised in October 2018, and the contracts \nare expected to be awarded by March 2019. In parallel, the recruitment of the supervision \nconsultant for the phase 2 works will also start in October 2018 and the contract is envisaged to \nbe awarded by March 2019. Advance actions in terms of finalizing the detailed design and bidding \ndocuments have been taken to ensure project implementation readiness. Recommendations of \nthe procurement risk assessment will be implemented in conjunction with the government. ADB \nwill continue to provide support to the MOTR procurement team and tender committee. \n \n30.  The country suffers from inadequate road maintenance, and budgetary allocations for \nplanned road maintenance have not been sufficient. To address this issue, the civil works \ncontracts for phase 2 will be based on a hybrid contract comprising construction works and \nperformance-based road maintenance activities. The defects notification period of the contract \nwill be expanded to include a performance-based road maintenance period of 5 years. The civil \nworks contract will be based on an amended version of ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. \n \n31.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and the MOTR. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  The project is expected to contribute to poverty reduction through the stimulation of \neconomic activities by improving the transport of goods and people and access to services. It will \nalso benefit local residents and enterprises by creating jobs during construction, and reducing \ntransport cost and travel time. The project is classified as a general intervention, with no direct \npoverty  reduction  component.  The  civil  works  contract  will  require  that  contractors  \n(i) comply with applicable labor laws of the Kyrgyz Republic and related international treaty \nobligations,  and  not  employ  child  labor;  (ii)  provide  safe  working  conditions  and  separate \nsanitation facilities for male and female workers; (iii) provide equal wages to male and female \nworkers for work of equal value; (iv) provide employment opportunities for women; and (v) carry \nout HIV/AIDS, illicit drugs, and human trafficking prevention and awareness programs in workers\u2019 \ncampsites. The project is categorized as having some gender elements, with the following gender \nactions: (i) employing women during construction; (ii) ensuring women\u2019s participation in all project \nconsultations, as well as in road safety campaigns; and (iii) including women staff of the MOTR \nin capacity building activities relevant to the project. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  Environment. The project is classified as category B under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, an IEE report, including \nan environmental management plan (EMP), has been prepared for each project section. The \nupdated reports were disclosed on the ADB and MOTR websites in June 2018. The road sections \ntraverse thorough sparse residential areas and close to a few archaeological sites. In addition, \nthe Balykchy\u2013Km 43 section is an existing road located inside a rehabilitation zone of the Issyk-\nKul Biosphere Reserve, which contains Issyk-Kul Lake, a Ramsar site. The lake is 6 km away \nfrom the starting point of the road section, and thus no impacts on the lake are expected. The \nEMP provides adequate mitigation measures and a monitoring plan. Site-specific EMPs will be \ndeveloped in consultation with the Issyk-Kul Biosphere Reserve Directorate. Impacts from the \nproject are expected to be mostly related to construction work and can be mitigated. The identified \nimpacts  during  the  construction  phase  include  noise,  dust,  vehicle  emissions,  vibration, \ndisturbances to rivers because of bridge rehabilitation and construction works along the rivers, \nlimited tree cutting, borrow and quarry sites, impacts from campsites and material processing \nplants, and traffic safety. Impacts during operation are likely to be insignificant and mainly related \nto an increase in noise levels and a decrease in road safety because of increased traffic. As part \nof the IEE, modeling studies for noise and vibration, and an archaeological survey (site walkover) \nwere undertaken; results are presented in the IEEs and were used as part of the impact \nassessment. The IPIG has adequate capacity for safeguard management. Public consultation \nwas conducted in all villages during the IEE preparation. \n \n34.  Resettlement. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement impacts. \nThe  census  carried  out  during  project  preparation  identified  approximately  40  affected \nhouseholds, including private agriculture plots and buildings, with 249 affected persons. Of the 40 \naffected households, 12 households, including 67 affected persons, will experience severe \nimpacts on their livelihood, and 16 households with 117 members were found to belong to \nvulnerable groups. A LARP was prepared to mitigate and address all the associated losses in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant national legislation.The LARP \n \nwas disclosed on the ADB website in July 2018. Consultations with the project stakeholders and \ndisplaced persons were undertaken during LARP preparation, and will continue throughout \nimplementation. A grievance redress mechanism will be put in place in accordance with the LARP \n ", "10 \nto  assist  affected  persons  in  resolving  grievances  and  complaints.  The  MOTR  will  submit \nsemiannual safeguards monitoring reports to ADB for review and disclosure. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples. There are no indigenous peoples, as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, in the project area, and the project is classified as category C for indigenous \npeoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  Project risk is rated low. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.15 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n37.  The government and the MOTR have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the MOTR have agreed with ADB on \ncertain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the financing agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan of $68,500,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic for the additional financing of the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 1 and 3 Connector Road \nProject (Phase 2), from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $9,500,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the additional financing of the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 1 and 3 Connector Road \nProject (Phase 2), on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board; and \n(iii)  the proposal in para. 22 of this report to permit procurement in a nonmember \ncountry of ADB of goods produced in the Russian Federation. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n8  October 2018\n                                                \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nCurrent project \nRegional and national connectivity enhanced (National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013\u20132017)a \nOverall project \nRegional and national connectivity enhanced (Development Program of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132022: Unity, Trust, \nCreation)b \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Risks \nTargets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms \nOutcome       \n       \nCurrent project  Current project  Current project  Current project \nEfficiency and safer  a.
