The Government of Sri Lanka requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) to support the Government\u2019s efforts to provide local authorities (LAs) \nwith the means to assume a greater role in financing social infrastructure and increasing their \nmanagement capacity. The TA Mission visited Sri Lanka during 19\u201329 May 2003 to prepare the \nTA rationale, design, costing, implementation plan, and outline terms of reference for experts for \nthe proposed Basic Social Infrastructure Development Project, for 2004.1 The objectives and \nscope of the TA were formulated based on discussions with stakeholders, including officials of \nthe  relevant  Government  agencies,  representatives  of  aid  agencies  and  leaders  and \nrepresentatives of local authorities. It also builds on the recommendations of the Urban Policy \nSector Framework and lessons from the ADB-financed Urban Development and Low-Income \nHousing Project (UDLIHP).2 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2003 TA program for Sri Lanka. This \nreport is based on the understanding reached with the Government. An initial poverty and social \nanalysis was carried out and is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Context. Since the beginning of 1987, the Government has been engaged in a policy of \ngradually devolving authority to provincial councils and local authorities. However, entrenched \nhabits of centralization and government inefficiency are taking time to break down and the \nessential building blocks of successful government  \u2014 appropriate staff, adequate financial \nresources,  and  an  appropriate  regulatory  framework  \u2014  will  require  years  of  work  and \nexperience to fine-tune. Since its inception, decentralization has been in name only due to \npolitical,  administrative,  and  financial  constraints.  Sustainable  development  and  poverty \nalleviation have fallen victim to all of these, as has governance efficiency.  \n \n3.  Lack of Basic Infrastructure and Services. The Sri Lankan municipal sector has \ndeveloped over the last decade, yet its capacity to meet investment responsibilities and respond \nto the increased demand for services is still at a relatively early stage of development and needs \nto be reinforced. The urban sector has gone through a process of rapid development with the \nincreased migration to the city centers and the expansion of the industrial, business, commercial \nand  service  sectors.  The  influx  of  mostly  poor  migrants  into  the  cities  and  towns  has \noverwhelmed infrastructure systems originally designed for much smaller numbers. The urban \nareas are not equipped for the rapid pace of expansion, which severely tests the capacity of \nlocal  authorities  to  efficiently  deliver  basic  urban  services  and  manage  economic, \nenvironmental, and investment resources. Urban deficiencies include deteriorated roads and \nsewers, inadequate supplies of potable water, poor drainage, and haphazard dumping and low \ncollection of solid waste. The urban poor, especially in the unserved and underserved areas, \nsuffer disproportionately from a range of diseases caused by poor environmental conditions and \ninadequate health care. Seasonal illnesses, like colds and flu, as well as malaria, diarrhea, and \ndysentery, are common.  \n \n4.  Inadequate  Mechanism  for  Sustained  Infrastructure  and  Service  Delivery.  Sri \nLanka\u2019s LAs remain fairly limited in their financial resource base, which is delimited by the \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 March 2003. \n2 ADB.1998.

", "2 \nMunicipal Council Ordinance and Urban Council Ordinance of 1987. LAs lack the institutional, \ntechnical, and financial resources needed to address existing deficiencies in local infrastructure \nservices, let alone expand them to meet the increasing demand. Their revenues are extremely \nlow (on average, $2.5 million for  a municipal council and $390,000 for an urban council \nannually). Less than half are from their own sources or locally collected revenues and these are \nlargely  fees  and  licenses.  Most  municipal  revenues  are  fiscal  transfers  from  the  central \nGovernment. At the same time, recurrent expenditures are increasing and now represent 70% \nof total expenditure on average. Of these, over 40% go to personnel costs. Except to a limited \ndegree in Colombo, LAs have no senior-level engineers, planners, or financial specialists, and \nmiddle-level technical personnel in the larger urban centers are scarce. Where infrastructure \nexists, LAs fail to ensure their effective operation and maintenance (O&M), due partly to \nfinancial constraints, partly to institutional weakness, and partly to unwillingness of LAs and of \ncommunities to accept O&M responsibility for works completed by higher levels of Government.  \n \n5.  Lessons Learned. The TA draws from the main lessons learned from ADB\u2019s and donor \nexperience in urban development in Sri Lanka and in other regions. The key lessons are as \nfollows:  \n \n(i)  Development objectives in the local government area are inherently long-term \nand must be pursued, not on a project-by-project basis, but in the framework of \nan extended program.  \n(ii)  Local  government  projects  should  establish  realistic  development  objectives, \nconsidering that (a) fundamental objectives are long-term in nature, and (b) it \ntakes a critical mass of technical assistance, training, and investments supported \nby a positive enabling environment to produce real results.  \n(iii)  Investment  programs  for  municipal  infrastructure  and  services  should  be \nimplemented  by  the  LAs  themselves  in  the  interest  of  (a)  building  capacity \nthrough learning by doing, and (b) promoting the sustainability of the investments \nwhere local participation from the communities is critical. \n(iv)  Previous  projects  focused  on  physical  investments  with  little  attention  to \ninstitutional  policy  measures,  while  others  aimed  to  bring  about  policy  and \ninstitutional  change  without  accompanying  investments.  These  projects  and \nprograms fell short. The proposed project will attempt to give due weight to both \naspects,  recognizing  that  (a)  investments  provide  a  good  vehicle  for  local \ninstitutional reform and capacity building, and (b) the sustainability of investments \nat the local level depends on a conducive policy and legal framework at the \ncentral level. \n(v)  One major problem behind ineffective or failed infrastructure projects throughout \nemerging economies is the lack of funding for O&M, which  reflects the poor \nfinancial planning of LAs. Strengthening financial planning and preparation of \ninvestment plans is critical for the sustainability of urban infrastructure assets. \n(vi)  Some technical assistance grants to LAs were not successful because they were \nsupply-driven  and  top-down.  Experience  has  shown  that  strengthening \nsubnational governments should be a demand-driven process, to ensure that the \ninterventions are truly effective and sustainable. A performance incentive should \nbe established for LAs.   \n(vii)  Previous local government projects have shown that there is a risk of political \ninterference in the operation of capacity-building programs and municipal funds. \nThe  ideal  approach  is  to  try  to  institutionalize  such  mechanisms  outside  of \ngovernment ministries and to provide steering committees or boards with non-\npolitical members. Capacity building should be rested in a semi-autonomous ", "    3 \nbody, whose vocation is public sector training. Ideally, the municipal funding \nmechanism should be established as a separate entity.  \n \n6.  Harmonization  with  Other  Agency  and  Government  Programs.  Other funding \nagencies  such  as  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency have been addressing deficiencies in municipal infrastructure in secondary \ntowns. In 1990, USAID supported the Urban Development Authority and the Ministry of Policy \nPlanning and Implementation with the drafting of the Framework for Urban Action Strategy. The \nGovernment  took  the  recommendations  on  board  to  develop  the  Urban  Sector  Policy \nFramework in 2002. The World Bank implemented the Municipal Management Project in 1985-\n1995, providing LAs with project-based training in general and engineering management. With \nthe  global  campaign  on  urban  governance,  initiated  by  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP) in 1999, UN-Habitat under Sustainable Cities Programme Sri Lanka has \nbeen the main donor agency supporting capacity building of LAs in the Greater Colombo area. \nThe upcoming UN-Habitat National Support Programme to Strengthen Urban Governance will \nalso  include  LAs  in  the  north  and  northeast.  ADB  has  supported  a  TA3 and two urban \ndevelopment sector projects4 to develop municipal and commercial infrastructure as well as \ncontribute to the policy dialogue on formulating a comprehensive urban sector policy. All these \nprograms supported the development of procedures and manuals for budgeting, procurement, \nand some aspects of personnel management. While commendable, these initiatives have had \nonly modest impact in relieving the institutional and capacity constraints within the Sri Lankan \nadministration. There is also little evidence of sustained improvements in output performance at \nthe LA level. Core functions such as medium-term planning, accounting and auditing, and \npersonnel management remain weak. Critical performance improvements and planned role \nrestructuring across line agencies advocated under the Urban Policy Sector Framework were \nnot implemented. These organizations strongly welcome ADB\u2019s timely assistance and continued \nsupport to improve the legal and policy framework and strengthen capacities to enable LAs to \nstart improving the quality and coverage of municipal infrastructure and services. The TA is in \nline with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program for Sri Lanka, which seeks to support the \nprocess of devolution and strengthen good governance. The TA is also consistent with the \nGovernment\u2019s goals as set out in Regaining Sri Lanka: (i) strengthening public policies and \nimplementation capabilities (ii) improving the country\u2019s infrastructure and facilitating growth, and \n(iii) alleviating poverty and upgrading municipal infrastructure. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The primary purpose of the TA is to design a program that will promote (i) more capable \nand accountable LA governance; (ii) sustainable and reliable urban services through more \neffective management and finance; and (iii) improved economic and social conditions in the \nselected LAs from investments in drainage, sanitation, community water, solid waste disposal, \nand other social municipal facilities and services. The purpose will be achieved by further \n                                                 \n3 ADB.  1999.

The \naccompanying legal and policy reform agenda will promote lean, competent, and motivated LAs \nand agencies responsive and accountable to their constituency.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will be structured in two parts. Part A will support continued strengthening of the \npolicy and operational framework to provide LAs an enabling environment to assume a greater \nrole in financing priority investments and effectively deliver  affordable and sustainable social \ninfrastructure to urban communities. Building on and complementing the recommendations of \nthe Urban Policy Sector Framework, the TA will (i) identify major outstanding pieces of the legal \nand policy framework, particularly in the areas of municipal financing and intergovernmental \nfiscal transfers and personnel management, that are needed to effectively operationalize LAs\u2019 \nautonomy  and  the  improvement  of  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services;  (ii)  identify \nopportunities  for  national-provincial-local  partnerships  in  financing  urban  infrastructure;  (iii) \nrecommend a municipal funding mechanism for financing capital investments by LAs to provide \nthe opportunity to learn by doing and to bring legitimacy and support to the municipalization \nprocess; and (iv) guide training institutions to help LAs manage resources better. \n \n9.  Part B will support increased access to basic social infrastructure and services in urban \ncommunities.  This  includes  improved  water  supply,  drainage,  tertiary  roads,  solid  waste \nmanagement, sanitation, and community health center facilities. The TA will (i) develop a policy \nmatrix to guarantee that LA capacity to deliver social infrastructure and services; (ii) develop a \nprogram and project framework; (iii) conduct economic and financial feasibility studies and \nenvironmental and social analyses; (iv) refine and complement the selection criteria developed \nunder the ADB-financed UDLIHP and define a prioritization mechanism for financing the social \ninfrastructure subprojects; (v) provide guidance and identify incentive systems for gradually \nimproving operation and maintenance, as well as cost recovery, of basic urban services by LAs; \nand (vi) prepare other documentation as required by ADB guidelines. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent comprising $400,000 in \nforeign exchange costs, and $225,000 in local currency. ADB will finance $500,000 equivalent, \nwhich includes the entire foreign currency costs and $100,000 in local currency costs. The \nremaining $125,000 equivalent will be contributed by the Government and will include office \naccommodation, counterpart staff remuneration, transportation, surveys, and workshops. The \nTA will be financed by ADB on  a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The Ministry of Policy Development and Implementation (MPDI) will be the Executing \nAgency for the TA. It will set up a TA implementing unit; appoint a manager for the unit; and \nprovide office space, furniture, equipment, and counterpart technical staff for the TA consultants \nas necessary. The implementing unit will  ensure that the Urban Policy Sector Framework \nCommittee is closely involved in the TA, and that its concerns are fully taken into consideration. \nThe Government will set up a technical assistance steering committee (TASC) under the \nchairmanship of the director general, External Resources Departmen (ERD) to periodically \nreview TA progress and resolve any issues that may arise. In addition to the ERD, the TASC will ", "    5 \ninclude the Ministry of Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government, Ministry of \nHousing and Plantation Infrastructure, and others as necessary. All representatives will be at \nleast at the director general level.  \n \n12.  The TA will be carried out over 6 months, beginning around March 2004 until August \n2004. The consulting team will include the following international consultants with input of 17 \nperson-months: a local governance and decentralization specialist/team leader, a municipal \ninfrastructure/finance specialist, a capacity building specialist, an urban infrastructure engineer, \nand a public economist for the preparation of the investment project. The domestic consultants \nwill include an urban development and planning specialist, a social development specialist, a \nfinancial analyst, a legal specialist, and an urban environment specialist (17 person-months \ntotal). All consultants will be selected and engaged through a firm following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. The simplified technical proposal format and the quality- and-cost-based \nselection method will be used. The consultants will procure equipment through direct purchase, \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n13.  The consultants will submit short monthly progress reports summarizing the project \nactivities, issues, and constraints of the TA. In addition, four major reports will be submitted: an \ninception report, no later than 3 weeks after the consultants are fielded; a midterm report, 3 \nmonths after TA inception; a draft final report, 5 months after inception; the final report within 3 \nweeks after comments on the draft final report are received from the Government and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Sri Lanka for preparing the Basic Social Infrastructure Development Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.
