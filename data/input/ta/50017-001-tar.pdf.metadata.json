INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for Supporting Financial Sector Development and Stability. ADB held \na fact-finding mission in February 2016 to reach an understanding with the government as to the \nproject\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, implementation and financing arrangements, costs, and \nterms of reference for consultants.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The \nTA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016 for Mongolia.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Mongolia\u2019s economy is undergoing a sharp decline, the result of a drop in commodity \nprices, a plunge in investment, and mismanagement of monetary and fiscal policies.  Foreign \ndebt to gross domestic product levels have increased substantially from 31.0% in 2010 to 77.4% \nin 2015. The currency has lost 12% of its value for the year to August 2016, and the fiscal deficit \nhas surged.  Growth has decelerated from a 2011 rise in gross domestic product of 17.3% to \n0.1% projected for 2016. The banking sector is experiencing crisis with the nonperforming loan \n(NPL) ratio rising to 9.2% as of April 2016.  As with most developing countries, the financial \nsystem  remains  vulnerable  to  shocks,  yet  its  development  plays  a  vital  role  in  facilitating \neconomic growth and reducing poverty. The government has prioritized building a resilient \nfinancial  system,  and  ADB  has  supported  this  effort  by  (i)  helping  to  establish  a  deposit \ninsurance framework for banks, (ii) enhancing the capacity of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) for \nbanking sector systemic risk management, and (iii) improving the supervision capacity of the Financial \nRegulatory Commission (FRC).  In this respect, the BOM, FRC, and Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nhave identified capacity constraints to be addressed.  \n \n3.  The  government\u2019s  financial  stability  framework  is  evolving.  A  key  entity  in  need  of \nsupport is the Financial Stability Council (FSC) formed by the heads of the MOF, BOM, and \nFRC. The FSC was formally established in January 2010 by an amendment to the law on the \nBOM\u2014supported  by  the  issuance  of  a  supporting  regulation  in  April  2010\u2014and  became \noperational in 2013. Its primary objectives are (i) safeguarding financial market stability, and (ii) \ndetermining and managing financial risks. The FSC\u2019s secretariat is domiciled in the BOM, which \nlacks the analytical tools and capacity to support all of the FSC\u2019s functions and perform rigorous \nmacro financial monitoring and surveillance. The roles of the FSC and its secretariat must be \nclarified further to ensure a proper range of responsibilities and the broad participation of all \nstakeholders, including the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Mongolia.  \n \n4.  The financial consumer protection framework is dispersed. Since the global financial \ncrisis  in  2008,  financial  consumer  protection  has  become  more  widely  recognized  as  a \nsignificant factor in economic development and the long-term stability of the financial system. \nMany jurisdictions\u2014including Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United \nStates\u2014have  improved  or  established  new  frameworks  for  financial  consumer  protection. \nSimilarly, financial consumer protection within Mongolia is an evolving area in which the BOM, \nFRC,  and  the  Authority  for  Fair  Competition  and  Consumer  Protection  each  play  a  role. \nHowever, these roles often overlap or leave gaps, and an overall framework and cooperation \nmechanism is lacking despite the involvement of many different entities responsible for financial \nconsumer protection within their own mandates.  \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 July 2016.  \n2  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2016. Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  Financial safety nets for savings and credit cooperatives (SCCs) require strengthening. \nSCCs are governed by the Law on Savings and Credit Cooperatives, which became effective on \n27 October 2011. SCCs were essentially self-regulated until 2006 when 30 declared bankruptcy, \ncausing around $50 million in public losses (50% of which the government ultimately paid). The \nFRC was established and tasked with regulating SCCs in 2006, but there is no universal deposit \ninsurance scheme or stabilization fund for SCCs. As of December 2015, 115 SCCs had joined \ntogether to form a cooperative deposit protection pool, and 114 SCCs had formed a cooperative \nstabilization fund. According to the law on SCCs, system-wide schemes must be established \nunder the management of the Mongolian Confederation of Credit Unions (MOCCU). \n \n6.  NPL levels are rising without a proper resolution mechanism. This rise indicates the \nneed  to  take  policy  actions  to  stem  possible  further  financial  instability.  Due  to  (i)  an \nunderdeveloped legal and institutional framework, (ii) limited capacity to administer such a \nprogram, and (iii) the lack of an overall strategy to deal with NPLs systemically, an effective NPL \nresolution mechanism is yet to be implemented. This makes it difficult for the financial sector to \nissue new credit, and consequently restricts economic recovery and growth. Lessons from the \n1997\u20131998 Asian Financial Crisis show that rapidly resolving NPLs is essential to strengthen \ncredit flows and hasten economic recovery.  \n \n7.  The disaster risk insurance sector lacks risk management capacity. Mongolia has a \nstrong economic foundation in agriculture, particularly in livestock herding. With the support of \nthe World Bank, the government developed a multilayer risk-sharing structure to protect herders \nagainst natural disaster-related livestock mortality. Under this initiative, the government, private \ninsurers, and herders share risks depending on the severity of impact. Recognizing that risk \nmanagement and reinsurance are essential to develop the insurance sector sustainably, in \nAugust 2014 the government established the Agricultural Reinsurance Company, which it is \nconsidering turning into a national reinsurance company. In order to upgrade the sector\u2019s risk \nmanagement, it is also necessary to build capacity for reinsurance policies and regulations. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be the improved capacity of, and public confidence in, the financial \nsector. The outcome will be financial sector risks mitigated. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  TA\u2019s  five  outputs  will  be  (i)  strengthening  the  government\u2019s  financial  stability \nframework, (ii) enhancing the financial consumer protection framework, (iii) promoting the sound \nand sustainable development of SCCs, (iv) identifying an effective NPL resolution mechanism, \nand (v) improving the disaster risk insurance sector\u2019s risk management capacity. ADB has \npreviously supported building a resilient financial system and strengthening financial regulatory \nregimes through policy recommendations and capacity development.3 The proposed project \nwould reinforce ADB\u2019s efforts to promote sound financial sector development, and the TA is \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2005.

Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,685,000, of which $1,250,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and $300,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. Cost estimates are found in Appendix 2. The government will provide \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office space for meetings, and equipment, supplies and \nsecretarial services for counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The proposed executing agency is the MOF. The implementing agencies are (i) the \nBOM for outputs 1, 2, and 4; (ii) the FRC for output 3; and (iii) the MOF Financial Markets and \nInsurance Division for output 5. The implementing agencies will be responsible for project \nimplementation, including (i) managing research and analysis; (ii) coordinating with counterparts \nand stakeholders; and (iii) organizing workshops, training and conferences, and study tours.  \n \n17.  Eight  international  and  five  national  consultants  will  be  engaged  individually  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime),  and  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Despite their overall financial \ntheme, the TA subcomponents are highly diverse in nature. Thus, due to the broad span of \ntopics covered by each output and wide variety of required skillsets, it will not be appropriate to \nengage a firm, as a single firm will be unable to recruit the necessary consultants in a timely \nmanner. Resource persons will also be engaged, as needed, to provide specialist inputs during \nworkshops. The consultant\u2019s outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB will establish an \nadvance payment facility to administer activities related to workshops and study tours. The TA \nwill be implemented over 33 months (September 2016\u2013June 2019), and will be monitored based \non the implementation of activities and delivery of outputs. ADB will conduct review missions to \nmonitor progress, and the results will be disseminated during workshops and closing meetings.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of TA not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, and (ii) ADB \nproviding the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,250,000 on a grant basis, to Mongolia \nfor Supporting Financial Sector Development and Stability, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \n(i)  Public confidence in the financial sector improved, and  \n(ii)  Capacity of the financial sector improved  \n(The Reform and Development Program of Financial Market Until 2025.)a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020     \nFinancial sector risks  1.
