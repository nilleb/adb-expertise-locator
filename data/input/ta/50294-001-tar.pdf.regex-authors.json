INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Energy efficiency measures should be treated as \u201cthe first fuel\u201d rather than \u201cthe hidden \nfuel,\u201d according to the International Energy Agency.1 Improving energy efficiency is a cost-\neffective measure for meeting energy demand  and ensuring sustainable economic growth. \nHowever, energy efficiency initiatives cannot be pursued in isolation and should be part of a \ncomprehensive  development  strategy  in  which  policies,  regulations,  standards,  technology \ndeployment, and other national and sector issues are interlinked. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) considers energy security and climate change to \nbe the dual challenges facing developing Asia\u2019s energy sector, and its Energy Policy aims to \ndirect ADB operations toward actions that will help the region address these challenges.2 ADB \nsupports energy efficiency opportunities in the investment portfolio of all ADB sectors. In 2015, \ninvestments in clean energy were just under $2.50 billion, with efficiency investments at $1.37 \nbillion.3 \n \n3.  During 1997\u20132016, South Asia has been one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, \nwith gross domestic product per capita rising by an average of 6% each year. ADB projected \nthat South Asia\u2019s energy consumption could grow by 3% per annum from 2010 to 2035.4 But the \nenergy sector has not been able to keep pace with the region\u2019s impressive macroeconomic \ngrowth, and South Asia continues to experience chronic supply shortage and poor quality of \nservice. ADB has significant experience in supporting supply-side energy projects to address \nsupply shortage, but it needs to build on this experience to strengthen synergies between \nsupply-side and demand-side interventions. The proposed technical assistance (TA) aims to \nassist  five  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  in  South  Asia  (Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  the \nMaldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka)5 in enhancing their capacity for energy efficiency development, \nand increasing energy efficiency investments in a cost-effective manner to meet the energy \ndemand in each country. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka are the ADB DMCs in \nSouth Asia. About 1.5 billion people live in the region, which is more than one-fifth of the global \npopulation, and its population is growing by 1.5% to 1.8% annually. South Asia accounts for \n6%\u20137% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but these figures are rising. \n \n5.  Three pillars guide the implementation of ADB\u2019s Energy Policy: (i) promoting energy \nefficiency and renewable energy, (ii) maximizing access to energy, and (iii) promoting policy \nreform to create the frameworks and an enabling environment for clean energy and widespread \nenergy  access.  Energy  demand  is  increasing  rapidly  in  these  five  DMCs  to  support  the \n                                                \n1  International Energy Agency. 2013.

According to ADB\u2019s \nEnergy Outlook for Asia and the Pacific, Bangladesh\u2019s primary energy demand is projected to \nincrease from 31.10 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2010 to 77.60 Mtoe in 2035, growing \nat an annual rate of 3.7%. Bhutan\u2019s primary energy demand is projected to increase from 1.41 \nMtoe in 2010 to 1.70 Mtoe in 2035, at an average annual growth rate of 0.8%. The Maldives\u2019 \nprimary energy demand is projected to increase from 0.26 Mtoe in 2010 to 0.64 Mtoe in 2035, at \nan average annual growth rate of 3.6%. Nepal is projected to increase from 10.20 Mtoe in 2010 \nto 16.60 Mtoe in 2035, at an annual growth rate of 2.0%. Sri Lanka is projected to increase from \n9.90 Mtoe in 2010 to 20.30 Mtoe in 2035, at an annual growth rate of 2.9%. These compare with \nthe projected world average growth rate of 1.5% per year for the same period (footnote 4). \n \n6.  Of  the  energy  supply  options,  energy  efficiency  measures  stand  out  as  the  most \ninexpensive way to acquire new energy system capacity and satisfy growing demand.7 To \naddress local, regional, and global environmental challenges successfully, each of the five \nDMCs has realized that it needs to take preventive measures to avoid an increase in emissions \namid  rapid  economic growth  and  increasing  energy  demand. This  has  compelled  them  to \naccelerate efforts to promote energy efficiency and to develop clean, renewable sources of \nenergy. \n  \n7.  Each country understands the impact of climate change and has made attempts to \ncombat it. All five countries have submitted their intended nationally determined contributions to \nthe United Nations. They recognize the impact of energy efficiency improvement not only in \nlowering energy bills or reducing the gap between energy demand and supply, but also in \nachieving national and global sustainability by reducing GHG emissions. Governments, ADB, \nand  other  development  partners  have  undertaken  several  initiatives  to  promote  energy \nefficiency. Most have focused heavily on softer outputs such as capacity building, enabling \nactivities,  demonstrations,  and  awareness  raising. 8  To  meet  future  energy  challenges, \ndevelopment partner assistance needs to transition from such programs to investments that \ndeliver energy savings while providing policy dialogue for capacity development to support \nenergy efficiency.  \n \n8.  The first step in identifying energy efficiency investment opportunities is energy audit, in \nparticular, detailed energy audit.  Energy audit is an inspection, survey, and analysis of energy \nflows for building, industrial system and process. Detailed energy audits or investment grade \nenergy audits provide solid recommendations which focus on a specific piece of equipment or \nprocess in a building or a facility, e.g., lighting, a boiler, a drying process etc. Energy audits are \npowerful tool for conducting technical and economic analysis of potential energy saving projects \nin a building or an industrial facility and identifying technically and economically feasible energy \nefficiency improvement opportunity for existing equipment. Detailed energy audits are the basis \nfor future engineering design of energy efficiency investment.  \n \n9.  In parallel with energy audits, institutional capacity development is also crucial to energy \nefficiency investment, such as development of national action plan and roadmap, enactment of \n                                                \n7  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  National  Action  Plan  for  Energy  Efficiency.  2009.

Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have developed some policies and have the \ncapability to support energy efficiency but still lack the institutional capacity to scale up energy \nefficiency in the industrial, commercial, and residential sectors. Bhutan, the Maldives, and Nepal \nare in an early stage to take the necessary steps to develop policies and strengthen their \ncapacity. \n  \n10.  Previous TA projects recommended energy efficiency improvement to mitigate GHG \nemissions and enhance energy security (footnote 8). The proposed TA aims to assist the five \nselected  DMCs  in  enhancing  government  capacity  to  design  and  develop  energy-efficient \nprojects, including by (i) conducting energy audits and identifying energy-saving measures in \nindustrial facilities and buildings; (ii) developing an inventory of bankable energy-saving projects \nsuitable  for  support  by  ADB,  other  financial  institutions,  or  energy  service  providers;  and \n(iii) supporting national and regional energy efficiency policy dialogue, developing energy-saving \naction plans and road maps, and providing training to energy professionals, such as energy \nmanagers and energy auditors, through the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nEnergy Working Group and cooperation among developing members. The TA will focus on \nidentifying large-scale energy efficiency projects in the two biggest energy consumer countries, \nBangladesh and Sri Lanka; and smaller energy efficiency projects in Bhutan, the Maldives, and \nNepal. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be sustainable investments in energy efficiency enhanced. The outcome \nwill be improved capacity of the five DMCs to develop energy efficiency projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA aims to realize the objectives of the five DMCs for high energy security and more \nefficient energy production and consumption. Knowledge products and experiences will be \nshared through the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation, the South Asian Association \nfor Regional Cooperation, and other channels. The TA will also conduct training programs and \ndialogue workshops on energy efficiency technologies, policies and regulations, and fiscal and \nfinancial instruments. It will produce the following outputs: \n(i)  Energy audit activities conducted. It includes detailed energy audits of at least \nfive  buildings  in total from five  countries,  one per country;  and  at  least five \nindustrial facilities in total from five countries, one per country. Each building shall \nhave a floor area of 2,000 square meters or larger; and each facility shall have an \nannual energy consumption of 600 tons of oil equivalent or greater. \n(ii)  A pipeline of energy efficiency projects developed. The pipeline includes at least \nfive investment grade energy efficiency projects (ideally one per DMC), which are \nidentified from the detailed energy audits.  \n(iii)  Capacity building activities and policy dialogues conducted. There will be, at least, \ntwo  training  programs  completed  for  the  five  DMCs;  two  policy  dialogue \nworkshops conducted for the five DMCs; and a total of 100 government officers \nfrom five DMCs trained.  \n \n13.  The TA outputs will contribute to strengthening the capacity of the five DMCs to develop \nenergy  efficiency  projects,  with  analytical  evidence gathered  during  the  energy  audits  and \n ", "4 \ndiscussions with stakeholders. The TA is built on the premise that the targeted DMCs are willing \nto formulate and implement energy efficiency projects. The main risks are (i) a change in \ngovernment  priorities  and  decreased  support  for  energy  efficiency  initiatives,  and  (ii)  high \nturnover of trained personnel, which will be mitigated through continuous policy dialogue with \nthe relevant DMC governments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.25 million, of which $2.00 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Clean Energy Fund9 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nand administered by ADB. The governments of the participating DMCs will provide counterpart \nsupport  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space  (if  needed),  transportation  and \naccommodation, assistance in project site visits, workshops and seminars, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB, through the Energy Division of the South Asia Department, will serve as the \nexecuting agency of the TA, in partnership with the relevant government agencies in each DMC. \nADB  will  obtain  a  no  objection  in  writing  from  the  relevant  government  agencies  before \ncommencing  and/or  financing  the  proposed  activities  in  the  five  DMCs.  The  proposed \nimplementing agencies for the TA, which will be finalized in consultation with the governments \nof each participating DMC, are \n(i)  Bangladesh: Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority; \n(ii)  Bhutan: Department of Renewable Energy; \n(iii)  the Maldives: Ministry of Environment and Energy; \n(iv)  Nepal: Ministry of Energy; and \n(v)  Sri Lanka: Sustainable Energy Authority. \n \n16.  The TA will engage 70 person-months of international consulting services and 116 \nperson-months  of  national  consulting  services  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). A consulting firm (4 international consultants \nfor 48 person-months and 20 national consultants for 70 person-months) will be engaged using \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  with  a  standard  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  Individual \nconsultants will also be engaged to support the project implementation, and will consist of (i) a \nsenior advisor (international, 22 person-months) who will act as lead technical expert on energy \nefficiency technology, policy, and finance; (ii) an operations coordinator (Philippine national, 36 \nperson-months); and (iii) a project analyst (national, 10 person-months). The outline terms of \nreference for the consultants is in Appendix 3.  \n \n17.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  carried  out  following  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Lump-sum or output-based contracts will be \nconsidered for consulting services under the TA, in line with the action plan for ADB\u2019s Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020 (actions 2.9.2 and 2.10.2).10 Disbursements under the TA will follow \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).
