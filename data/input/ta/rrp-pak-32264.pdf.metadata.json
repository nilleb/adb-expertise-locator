An  environmental  assessment  of  the  policy  matrix  was \nAssessment  undertaken and is available as Supplementary Appendix I. \n   \nRationale  Pakistan experienced good economic growth in the 1980s but generally \nperformed poorly in the 1990s when poverty was exacerbated. Recently, \neconomic performance has improved; however, Pakistan remains a poor \ncountry with extremely low social indicators. Punjab is the largest province \nof Pakistan with an estimated population of 83 million or 56% of the total \npopulation. The incidence of poverty in the province was around 34.1% in \n2001/02, much higher than 28.2% estimated in 1993/94. The urban-rural \ngap is significant: poverty has increased more rapidly in rural areas, from \n31.9% in 1993/94 to about 37.0% in 2001/02. Inequitable provision of \nsocial services, as reflected by the upper-income groups commanding \ngreater  access  than  households  with  lower  incomes,  has  led  to  an \nincrease in poverty of opportunity. As a result, Punjab\u2019s social indicators \nfall far short of its economic development, as reflected by low literacy \nrates; high infant, child, and maternal mortality rates; high susceptibility to \ncommunicable diseases; very low proportion of deliveries by trained birth \nattendants; high disparity among income and gender groups in access to \nsocial services; and inadequate conditions of sanitation and solid waste \nmanagement. A key reason in the inability to reduce poverty and improve \nthe social indicators in the country in general, including Punjab, has been \nthe poor performance of the overly centralized and inefficient bureaucracy. \nLocal-level government agencies have been incapable of delivering basic \nsocial services for a variety of reasons, including lack of proper incentives, \nunderstaffing, corruption, inadequate capacity, and lack of participation by \nthe beneficiaries.  \n ", "iv   \n  Responding  to  the  chronic  failure  to  deliver  the  basic  social  services \nneeded to reduce poverty, the Government of Pakistan (the Government) \ninitiated a sweeping and complex reform program in 2001 designed to \ndevolve the authority and responsibility for social services to the local \nlevel.  Under  the  Local  Government  Ordinance  of  2001,  the  provincial \ngovernments  have  transferred  primary  responsibility  of  major  social \nservice delivery functions, including education, health, and WSS, to local \ngovernment institutions. This change has resulted in redefinition of roles \nand responsibilities at the provincial and local government levels, including \nplanning, financing, execution of services, and monitoring. \n   \nOverall, the Government of Punjab (PG) is short of resources in relation to \nits  large  socioeconomic  needs.  At  the  moment,  the  fiscal  structure  in \nPakistan is heavily skewed in favor of the Government, with provinces and \nlocal  governments  both  heavily  reliant  on  fiscal  transfers  from  the \nGovernment.  In  response,  the  Government  has  prepared  a  Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) with the provinces having developed \nsimilar  province-level  PRSPs,  which  set  out  a  comprehensive  policy \nreform agenda to break the vicious cycle of poverty. Punjab\u2019s PRSP (P-\nPRSP)  aims  to  improve  governance;  reform  fiscal  and  financial \nmanagement;  create  a  supportive  environment  for  private  sector-led \ngrowth; improve the delivery of public services, especially basic social \nservices; and address vulnerabilities. PG is refocusing its expenditures on \npro-poor  sectors.  PG  has  started  preparing  a  medium-term  budgetary \nframework to prioritize its expenditures since fiscal year (FY) 2003/04, \nwhich needs to be strengthened and expanded to cover all sectors. PG \nremains committed to continuing the ongoing financial and governance \nreforms and this commitment has been expressed at the highest possible \nlevels. \n   \nObjectives and  The  overall  goal  of  PDSSP  is  to  achieve  progress  on  the  Millennium \nScope  Development Goals (MDGs) related to poverty, gender, education, health, \nand WSS. PDSSP\u2019s objective is to strengthen devolved social services for \na more equitable, efficient, effective, and sustainable delivery of social \nservices  in  line  with  the  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  2001 \n(PLGO). In order to achieve the goal and objective, it will be necessary to \nsupport  reforms  and  capacity  building  to  help  (i) expand  coverage  of \nhealth  services  (especially  for  women  and  children),  increase  school \nenrollment rates, and improve access to WSS facilities; (ii) move away \nfrom provincially-driven to demand-driven programs that are identified and \nimplemented  by  LGs  in  line  with  P-PRSP,  medium-term  budgetary \nframework,  and  provincial  strategic  plans  and  guidelines  to  achieve \nMDGs; and (iii) enhance the capacity of LGs to assume new roles and \nresponsibilities in social services as envisaged under the PLGO, including \nparticipatory planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. \n \n \n ", "  v\n   \n  PDSSP  is  built  around  three  principal  policy  outcomes:  (i) realigning \nintergovernment  relations  to  support  devolved  social  services; \n(ii) rationalizing and setting minimum standards for social services; and \n(iii) strengthening  the  public  accountability  mechanisms  and  promoting \npublic-private partnership. \n \nPDSSP is designed to support the devolution of social services for 3 \nyears, covering all 34 district governments (DGs) and up to 44 program \ntehsil (town) municipal administrations (TMAs), except for those TMAs \nfunded by the Water and Sanitation Authority and those receiving any \nsupport from two ongoing projects funded by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). The TA component for strengthening the devolution of social sector \nservices will be for a period of 4 years. \n \n  PG proposes three areas of policy actions focusing on strengthening LGs \nto deliver improved social services. First, the provincial line departments \n(PLDs)  through  a  consultative  process  will  formulate  and  disseminate \nprioritized  strategic  plans  for  5  years,  which  will  then  guide  DGs  and \nprogram TMAs to develop and finalize 3-year prioritized rolling plans. LGs \nand PLDs will jointly delineate roles and responsibilities of PG and LGs. \nAdditional  funds  will  be  provided  to  participating  LGs  in  the  form  of \nconditional grants to strengthen devolved social services. \n \nSecond,  PG,  in  consultation  with  LGs,  will  set  pro-poor  and  gender-\nsensitive  minimum  service  delivery  standards  to  target  the  poor  and \nvulnerable population. This will cover introducing measures to rationalize \nthe  staff  mix  and  skills  mix,  fill  up  all  essential  vacancies,  improve \nmanagement of service delivery, and enhance gender parity. \n \nThird, PG  and LGs will strengthen accountability mechanisms through \nquality  assurance  functions,  objective  monitoring  through  strengthened \ncommittees, citizen participation and information systems, and third party \nevaluation. PG also proposes to promote public-private partnership (PPP) \nby  developing  a  policy  that  covers  mechanisms  to  establish  and \nstrengthen  PPP;  regulation  and  self-regulation  through  a  consultative \nprocess;  and  strengthening  partnerships  with  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  and \ncommunity citizen boards to improve service delivery. \n   \nCost Estimates  The costs associated with policy and institutional reforms addressed by \nthe program loans and grant are estimated to be at least $200 million \nequivalent. \n   \n ", "vi   \nFinancing Plan  PG  has  requested  financial  assistance  of  $180 million  equivalent, \ncomprising two program loans of $75 million equivalent from the Special \nFund  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF])  and  $75 million \nequivalent from ordinary capital resources (OCR), and a grant from the \nGovernment  of  the  United  Kingdom,  through  the  Department  for \nInternational  Development  (DFID)  of  $30 million  equivalent,  to  provide \nbudgetary support to PG.  \n   \nProgram Loan  The ADF loan will have a maturity of 24 years, including a grace period of \nAmounts and  8 years; interest of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nTerms  thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft \nLoan and Program Agreements. \n   \n  The OCR loan will have a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 \nyears;  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  including  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements. \n \nThe Government has agreed to relend the proceeds of the loans to PG in \ndomestic currency, on the same terms and conditions, as are applicable to \nthe Borrower. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by PG. \n   \nProgram Period  The program period will be from 31 March 2005 to 31 March 2008. The \nand Tranching   first, second, and third tranches, equivalent to $80 million, $55 million and \n$45 million, will be made available upon compliance with tranche release \nconditions following loan effectiveness. \n   \nExecuting  Planning and Development Department (P&DD), Punjab  \nAgency \n   \nImplementation  A steering committee representing relevant provincial line departments, \nArrangements  local governments, and civil society will be established at the P&DD to \nprovide  overall  policy  guidance  to  coordinate  the  Program.  The \nDepartment of Health will be the lead implementing agency, while the \nDepartments  of  Education,  Special  Education,  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment and Public Health Engineering, DGs, and program TMAs will \nbe the other implementing agencies. The program support unit (PSU) and \n34 local support groups financed under the TA will assist with planning, \ncoordinating, and monitoring the policy reform and development activities. \n   \n ", "  vii\nProcurement,  The loan proceeds will finance the foreign exchange costs (excluding local \nDisbursement,  taxes and duties) of eligible items produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s \nand Counterpart  member countries. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the proceeds \nFunds  of the loans and verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. PG will \nuse counterpart funds in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to \nADB, to support the development and reform of devolved social services \nin Punjab and incremental costs associated with the Program, including \nincreased  costs  of  devolved  administration  and  rehabilitation  of  social \nservices, and up-front financing of LGs and CBOs. The Government and \nPG will certify the utilization of counterpart funds in line with the Loan and \nProgram Agreements through audited statements acceptable to ADB. \n   \nThe Technical  PG  has  also  requested  a  TA  to  (i) strengthen  sector  and  program \nAssistance  management and monitoring, (ii) build capacity of LGs and CBOs in social \nsector governance and development, and (iii) support policy reforms. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $25.0 million  equivalent,  comprising \nand Financing  $3.2 million in foreign exchange costs and $21.8 million equivalent in local \nPlan  currency costs. The Government of the United Kingdom through DFID will \nfinance the equivalent of $20.0 million, and PG will finance the equivalent \nof $5.0 million of the TA cost. \n   \nPeriod of  From 31 March 2005 to 31 March 2009. \nUtilization   \n   \nExecuting  Planning and Development Department (P&DD), Punjab  \nAgency \n   \nImplementation  The TA will also be guided by the steering committee established for the \nArrangements  Program,  and  will  primarily  support  program  implementation,  capacity \nbuilding,  and  reforms  through  the  PSU  with  representation  of  four \nprovincial line departments and 34 local support groups at the LG level.  \n   \nProcurement  All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nunder the TA  for Procurement. Contract packages valued at $500,000 equivalent or less \nwill follow international shopping procedures, except for vehicles, which \nmay be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB). Minor packages \ncosting $100,000 equivalent or less may be procured through LCB or \ndirect purchase. \n   \nConsulting  A management firm will be recruited competitively following quality and \nServices under  cost-based selection procedures to deliver the TA on a needs basis and \nthe TA  only some consultants for the PSU will be recruited individually according \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The TA \nwill provide a total of 50 person-months of international and 4,978 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services Consultants include experts on \nfinance  and  governance,  poverty  and  gender,  capacity  building  and \ntraining, community organization, contracting and personnel management, \nengineering, environment, economics, sector reform, and monitoring and \nevaluation.  \n ", "viii  \n   \nProgram Benefits  The  main  beneficiaries  of  PDSSP  will  be  the  rural  and  urban  poor, \nand Beneficiaries  particularly women and girls. Special attention will be given to vulnerable \ngroups. \n   \nRisks and  PDSSP  faces  four  potential  risks:  political,  governance,  capacity \nAssumptions  constraints, and macroeconomic and external. First, while many reforms \nran  into  difficulty  and  were  either  delayed  considerably  or  not  fully \nimplemented due to political pressures, changes in Government, or stiff \nopposition  to  reforms,  the  risk  is  much  less  in  Punjab  than  in  other \nprovinces  because  of  a  more  stable  political  environment  and  strong \nbureaucracy.  This  is  demonstrated  by  smooth  implementation  of  the \nPunjab  Resource  Management  Program  and  Punjab  Education  Sector \nReform  Program.  PDSSP  has  an  attached  TA  component  to  ensure \nownership and to keep reforms on track through stakeholder participation \nand within the PLGO framework. \n   \nSecond, PDSSP\u2019s emphasis on transparent and objective decision making \nto  minimize  rent-seeking  might  be  delayed  or  undermined  by  vested \ninterests. PDSSP builds on stakeholder ownership during the program \ndesign  and  implementation  stages;  establishes  program  oversight \nmechanisms  including  participation  of  local  council  committees;  and \nensures  synergy  with  other  programs  such  as  the  Punjab  Resource \nManagement  Program,  Decentralization  Support  Program,  and  Punjab \nEducation Sector Reform Program. \n \n  Third, while devolution moves social sector planning, implementation, and \nmonitoring closer to beneficiaries, it also requires additional commitment \nand improved capacity at the local service delivery level. PDSSP includes \na substantial TA package to support capacity building and institutional \nstrengthening at the local level, including through the use of management \ncontracts. \n   \nFourth, PG has been facing serious budget deficits in the past with a \nhistory of poor revenue collection, which resulted in serious budget cuts \nfor  the  social  sectors  during  the  1990s.  PG  has  committed  additional \nresources  in  its  projections  under  the  P-PRSP  and  medium-term \nbudgetary framework to substantially enhance social sector allocations \n   \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on: (i) two proposed \nprogram loans, (ii) proposed administration of a grant for budgetary support by the Government \nof  the  United  Kingdom,  through  the  Department  for  International  Development,  and  (iii) \nproposed administration of technical assistance by the Government of the United Kingdom, \nthrough the Department for International Development, to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for \nthe Punjab Devolved Social Services Program. \n \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \n2.  The Government of Pakistan (the Government) has been pursuing an ambitious reform \nagenda over the last 4 years aimed at putting the economy on a stronger and more stable \nfooting. With the rescheduling of external debt and a more proactive debt management strategy \nin place, record levels of exports, lower interest rates, a buoyant stock market, and a continued \npolicy of privatization, gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been increasing, estimated at \nabout 6.4% in fiscal year (FY) 2004, and projected to rise to 6.6% in FY2005. The high growth \nhas been accompanied by relatively stable prices, lower debt service payments, manageable \nfiscal deficits, an external account surplus, and unprecedented high levels of foreign exchange \nreserves.  Several  factors  are  cited  for  this  economic  recovery,  including  economic  and \ngovernance  reforms,  stabilization  policy  of  the  Government  in  the  past  few  years,  global \ndevelopments  after  September  11,  2001,  and  positive  developments  on  the  political  and \nregional fronts. However, despite these positive developments, investment activity has been \nsluggish due to excess capacities and cautious behavior of investors. With recent improvements \nin regional, political, and business environments, officials are now optimistic that investments \nwill  increase.  Barring  any  major  policy  reversal  and  political  and  international  upheavals, \nPakistan\u2019s economy is poised for high economic growth in the coming years.1 \n  \n3.   In spite of the relatively optimistic economic prospects, Pakistan remains a poor country \nwith very low social indicators that are among the worst in the region. The Government is aware \nthat poverty, illiteracy, and ill health among its population are a major hindrance to economic \nprogress and a source of social instability. Accordingly, the Government has undertaken a \nsweeping and complex reform program designed to devolve authority and responsibility to the \nlocal level and prepared a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).  \n \n4.   The  devolution  provides  a  framework  for  three  major  reforms,  namely  political, \nadministrative, and fiscal. By political reforms, the Government created a third tier of local \ngovernment (LG) at the district level and below through local-level elected representatives. The \nadministrative  and  management  powers  were  decentralized  including  human  resource \nmanagement for 12 important sectors including social services and infrastructure. The political \nand administrative decentralization was backed by fiscal reforms in the shape of provision of \nblock grants to the LGs, and authority to raise revenue through levy of local taxes. \n \n5.  Prepared after extensive consultations with all stakeholders, the PRSP revolves around \nfour  basic  strategies:  (i) achieving  high  and  broad-based  economic  growth,  (ii) improving \ngovernance and consolidating devolution, (iii) developing human capital and efficient delivery of \n                                                        \n1  Pakistan would need to invest $1.5 billion to $2 billion additional resources to achieve a medium-term gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth rate of 8% per annum, according to a joint press conference of the ADB and the \nGovernment at the time of the 2004 Pakistan Development Forum. 17\u201319 March 2004. ", "2  \nsocial services, and (iv) reducing inequalities and bringing the poor, vulnerable, and backward \nregions into the mainstream of development. The PRSP emphasizes that poverty reflects social, \npolitical,  and  economic  exclusion  and  prescribes  greater  social  inclusion  through  human \ndevelopment and devolution. Provincial governments, too, have developed similar province-\nlevel PRSPs, including the province of Punjab, which set out a comprehensive policy reform \nagenda to break the vicious cycle of poverty. \n \n6.  Although the PRSP provides a solid conceptual framework for accelerating economic \ngrowth and reducing poverty, its implementation is predicated on a stable political and economic \nenvironment. The Government is committed to continue ongoing financial and governance \nreforms and this commitment has been expressed at the highest levels. Recent agreements on \nthe political front and moves to improve relations with India are encouraging.  \n \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR  \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n \n7.  Punjab  is  the  largest  province  of  Pakistan  with  an  estimated  population  of  about \n83 million or 56% of the total population of Pakistan. Given the size of the population in the \nprovince, the quality of the delivery of social services by the Government of Punjab (PG) affects \nover half of the country's population. To reverse the trend and sharpen the focus on poverty \nreduction at the provincial level, a Punjab PRSP (P-PRSP) was developed in 2003 in the \ncontext of the national PRSP.  \n \n8.  Punjab  PRSP.  P-PRSP  aims  to  improve  governance,  reform  fiscal  and  financial \nmanagement,  create  a  supportive  environment  for  private-sector  led  growth,  improve  the \ndelivery  of  public  services  (especially  basic  social  services),  and  address  vulnerabilities. \nGovernance  improvements  include  civil  service  reforms  and  strengthening  devolution  and \nplanning  processes  to  improve  efficiency,  accountability,  and  service  orientation.  Planning \nimprovements include delineating responsibilities between the PG and LGs for policy making, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring;  strengthening  provincial  and  LG  capacities;  and  preparing \nmedium-term strategies under the medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF), which needs to \nbe strengthened. As the largest province, the successful implementation and sustainability of \nthe P-PRSP and its pro-poor expenditures on devolved social services are crucial for Pakistan \nto move toward overall reduction in poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). PG has requested long-term support from ADB for its devolved social services.2 The \nprogram framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n1.  Poverty and Social Indicators in Punjab  \n \n9.  Per  capita  income  and  poverty  characteristics  in  Punjab  mirror  overall  country \ncharacteristics, with marginally better figures. The incidence of poverty in the province was \naround 34.1% in 2001/02, much higher than the 28.2% estimated in 1993/94. The urban-rural \ngap is significant. Poverty increased more rapidly in rural areas, rising from 31.9% in 1993/94 to \nabout 37.0% in 2001/02 while urban poverty increased from 18.4% to 27.0% in during the same \nperiod.3  Poverty  is  more  widespread  in  southern  Punjab,  where  the  level  of  economic \ndevelopment and income are generally lower than in northern Punjab. Seven of the province\u2019s \n                                                        \n2  ADB. 2004. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006).

Provision of social services follows the national trend of inequity across income groups \nand gender. Inequity is also marked by wider gaps in various access related social indicators \nbetween the rich and the poor in rural areas than in urban areas. Education opportunities at the \nprimary, middle, and secondary levels are limited for poor rural children and females. The \ndropout  rate  of  children  from  low-income  households  is  triple  those  from  higher  income \nhouseholds.6 Girls face the additional burden of gender discrimination. About 2.0 million children \naged 5 to 9 and 6.4 million children aged 10 to 14 were out of school in 2003.  \n \n11.  The availability of piped water in rural households among the lowest income quintile is \nonly about a third of the highest quintile\u2019s. Child mortality is very high\u2014nearly 11% of the \nchildren do not live to their fifth birthday partly because of limited access to adequate childhood \nhealth  care  services.  Childhood  immunization  levels  are  around  60%.  Every  year,  about \n200,000 women run into complications of pregnancy; the maternal mortality ratio is high at 500 \ndeaths per 100,000 live births because of lack of access to obstetric emergency care. In \naddition, only 40% of pregnant women have at least one antenatal checkup. Although the \naverage  age  at  marriage  (22.5  years)7  and  the  contraceptive  prevalence  rate  (30%)  have \nincreased over time, the population growth rate is 2.1% per annum and the total fertility rate is \nstill one of the highest in the region at 4.66. Malnutrition is a major contributor to infant and \nmaternal death. Currently, there are about 4 million malnourished children in Punjab, and about \na third of all pregnant women have iron deficiency anemia.8 The situation among the poor is \ngrim. Mortality rates are 69% higher in the poorest quintile than the richest quintile; the rate of \nunderweight children in the poorest quintiles is double that of the richest quintiles.  \n \n12.  The population residing in large urban areas, especially in industrial towns, is better off \nin terms of quality of life than those living in medium and small villages, especially in remote \npopulation clusters. The private health and education sectors are well established in cities from \nprimary to tertiary levels, and competitive market mechanisms that are gradually evolving have \nserved  to  monitor  the  cost  of  services.  The  not-for-profit  sector,  e.g.,  foundations  and \nphilanthropic organizations, is also active in some urban areas in serving the poor. Unlike in \ncities and towns, the private sector involvement in social service delivery is limited in the rural \nareas and is dependent on commitment and leadership of a few individuals. Some parts of \nPunjab, especially rural areas of southern Punjab, are controlled by the feudal system. As a \nresult, incidence of poverty remains high, which has led to many poverty-related interventions in \nthese areas. The rural population historically lacks the confidence and skills to take control of \npublicly financed social services.  \n \n13.  Women\u2019s situations are characterized by discrimination at the social, cultural, legal, and \npolitical  levels.  Although  the  Constitution  of  Pakistan  provides  guarantees  against  any \n                                                        \n4  The Social Policy Development Center, Karachi developed a district profile of concentration of poverty for each \nprovince in 2001, using four indicators namely employment, education, housing, and housing services (which \nincludes water supply and sanitation). \n5  World Bank, ADB, DFID.

Devolution has addressed gender issues to a \nconsiderable extent, including the reservation of one third of seats at all levels of parliaments for \nwomen. Major gender reforms are planned under the gender reform action plan (GRAP) already \napproved by PG. \n \n2.  Devolution to Local Governments  \n \n14.  Under the centralized system, social sectors were poorly planned, administered, and \nmonitored; hence, improvement in social indicators was slower than planned. Planning was a \ntop-down  approach  with  hardly  any  involvement  of  citizens  or  communities  in  planning, \nimplementing,  or  monitoring  social  services.  The  public  sector  had  assumed  the  role  of \npurchaser as well as provider of services with very little partnership with the not-for-profit or for-\nprofit  private  sector.  Centralized  planning  and  management  created  a  number  of \nshortcomings\u2014inappropriate location of facilities, staff absenteeism, short-working hours, low \nquality of services, and lack of consumer satisfaction\u2014leading to low productivity and higher \nunit costs. The low level of funding for social sectors in the late 1990s, especially for the \nnonsalary budget, led to further deterioration in the quality of social services. \n \n15.  On 14 August 2001, the LG system replaced the old system of provincial administrations \nat the division, district, and tehsil levels. The new system, regulated under the Punjab Local \nGovernment Ordinance 2001 (PLGO), provides for much more autonomous LGs in districts, \ntehsil municipal administrations (TMAs), in towns and union administrations (UAs) in villages. \nThe intent is to devolve political power and decentralize administrative and financial authority to \naccountable LGs for improved governance, effective delivery of social services, and transparent \ndecision making through institutionalized participation of the people at the grassroots level. The \nnew system is designed to bring decision making closer to beneficiaries of public services; \nensure citizens\u2019 involvement and oversight in planning and implementation; and give a greater \nvoice  to  women,  peasants,  laborers,  and  marginalized  population  groups.  Devolution  of \nadministrative and financial powers, followed by the appropriate empowerment, staffing, and \nresource allocation to LGs, is expected to deliver better public services like health, education, \nand water supply and sanitation (WSS). PG, to date, has issued more than 60 administrative \norders and 16 consequential pieces of legislation for transfer of powers to LGs under the PLGO. \n \n16.  Devolution is, however, in a transition phase and transfer of powers is still continuing. \nThe PG and LGs are clarifying their roles and responsibilities and devising mechanisms to build \ncapacity at various levels. There is a challenge in meeting citizens\u2019 expectations on the one \nhand and filling large capacity gaps on the other. With a paradigm shift in the power structure, \nthere are tensions both between the provincial- and local government-elected representatives \nand within LG tiers, which need to be carefully addressed through appropriate management of \nintergovernment relations. The capacity of LGs to undertake their new roles and responsibilities \nhas to be strengthened. A number of initiatives are under way to improve the capacity of LGs \nunder the Decentralization Support Program (DSP), Punjab Resource Management Program \n(PRMP), and PG's own inputs. While these efforts are in the right direction, they need to be \nsustained in the medium term, particularly to help reduce the tensions between provincial and \nlocal offices. \n \n   ", "  5\n3.  Social Sector Financing \n \n17.  Overall, the PG lacks sufficient resources to meet its large socioeconomic needs as \nreflected in its MTBF. Under the P-PRSP, PG has committed to increase the pro-poor social \nexpenditures by another 40% by FY2006, when these sectors would account for 42% of the \nconsolidated budget of the province. At present, provincial expenditures on all development and \nnondevelopment activities, including LG expenditures, are about 6.5% of provincial GDP. This \namounts to less than $30 per capita for running the government, servicing debt, supporting LGs, \nmaintaining infrastructure, and financing social services. Provinces, including Punjab, and LGs \nare heavily reliant on fiscal transfers from the Government. PG derives 80% of its revenues from \nfederal transfers and 20% from its own revenues; both these revenue sources grew by 13\u201315% \nper annum in the last 5 years. However, the trend in revenue increase is not sufficient to finance \nPunjab\u2019s increased expenditure obligations under the P-PRSP and the cost of implementing \ndevolution.  \n \n18.  In the social sectors, PG has undertaken various initiatives to improve their performance. \nThere is substantial increase in social sector allocations. Expenditures on education, health, and \nWSS services collectively made up about 32% of total provincial spending during FY2000/01 \nthrough  FY2003/04.  These  expenditures  grew  roughly  in  line  with  overall  provincial \nexpenditures during this period (8.6% per annum). Growth rates, however, varied between \nsectors\u2014education at 12.1% per annum, health at 7.7% per annum, and WSS at 8.6% per \nannum. Allocations to the three sectors increased substantially in FY2004/05 in line with P-\nPRSP\u2014education at 27.2%, health at 40.8%, and WSS at 123.9%,9 with an overall increase of \n31.6%. Overall, the share of these social sectors in the provincial budget rose to 35.8%. The \n2004/05 budget provided a generous increase for the nonsalary budget. \n \n19.  PG  negotiated  the  PRMP  with  ADB  in  September  2003  to  strengthen  its  finances, \nrealign governance institutions for pro-poor service delivery, and increase opportunities for \nincome and growth in the private sector. It proposes to create fiscal space by developing a \nbroad-based tax structure, rationalizing expenditure and management functions, and providing \nfor labor market interventions to support the private sector. The proposed levels of funding for \nsocial sectors, over one third of the total expenditures, appear sustainable if the PRMP is \nimplemented as planned, debt service is reduced, and inflows from other planned development \npartner-assisted programs and projects are timely. It is also expected that there will be an \nincrease  in  the  provincial  share  of  federal  transfers  under  the  new  National  Finance \nCommission award. PG\u2019s commitment to enhance social sector allocations, improve social \nindicators, and reduce poverty of opportunity is supported by assistance that includes the \nPunjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) supported by the World Bank, and the two \nhealth and two WSS projects supported by ADB.10  \n \n                                                        \n9 The extraordinary increase for WSS is due to the dip in expenditures on WSS sector in FY2003/04 because of \nconfusion of roles and responsibilities by level. \n10 ADB. 2003.

Social Sector Development \n \n20.  The  social  sectors  are  human  resource  intensive,  have  a  wide  infrastructure,  and \nconsume nearly 36% of public sector expenditure. The urban-based facilities often work beyond \ntheir capacity because of better quality services, large and rising population to serve, higher \nliteracy rates and awareness of consumers, and better communication links. While urban areas \noffer a different set of challenges and provide options for service delivery, rural facilities are \nscattered,  poorly  staffed,  and  underutilized.  Rural  facilities  have  inadequate  nonsalary \noperational  budgets,  many  unfilled  vacancies  (particularly  in  disadvantaged  locations),  low \nquality of services because of poor management and weak monitoring arrangements, limited \naccess for women, limited user and community involvement, and poor public accountability.  \n \n21.  However, the transition process under the devolved setup is under way. Water user \ncommittees (WUCs) are now taking charge of WSS schemes and school councils (SCs) have \nbecome active in several districts to improve management and quality of education. Other \ninitiatives are either planned or under way, including formation of community citizen boards \n(CCBs) as development partners, evening classes by nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nusing public sector schools, contracting-in management of basic health units in one district, and \nimproved procedures for appointments and postings and transfers, etc. PG and LGs have \nalready initiated several programs to move toward universal schooling of children: expansion of \nteacher training, consolidation of schools up to middle level, running evening classes in existing \nschools, providing incentives to the private sector through restructured Education Foundation, \ngranting waiver of tuition fees up to secondary level, providing stipends for girls in classes 6\u20138 \nin the 15 districts with the lowest literacy rates, and recruiting teachers to fill vacancies. The \nsector analyses are summarized below while further details appear in Appendix 2. \n \n5.  Education \n \n22.  The national Education Sector Reform 2001\u20132005 (ESR), anchored on the Education for \nAll Goal by 2015, seeks to implement key strategies to improve the gender balance and the \nquality of and access to education through a more realistic estimation of resources to meet the \ngaps. ESR aims to increase (i) literacy rate from 49% to 60%, (ii) gross primary enrollment rate \nfrom 83% to 100%, (iii) gross middle school enrollment from 48% to 55%, and (iv) secondary \nschool enrollment from 30% to 40%, all by 2005.  \n \n23.  While PG has aligned its future plans in line with ESR in its own PESRP, successful \nimplementation requires a highly concerted and Herculean effort, as indicated by the challenges \nconfronting Punjab. Enrollment and dropout rates stagnated in 1996\u20132001. There is a large \ndisparity in gross enrollment rates across income groups, urban and rural areas, and genders. \nThe present facilities fall short of overall needs and require expansion. Many teacher vacancies \nhave  remained  unfilled  for  a  long  time,  particularly  in  disadvantaged  locations  where \nenrollments are the lowest. Expansion at primary level will be followed by subsequent increases \nin middle and secondary school enrollments, and require, among other things, more qualified \nteachers, good learning materials, and monitoring of children\u2019s learning.  \n  \n24.  Some  administrative,  planning,  and  academic  functions  have  been  devolved  to  the \ndistrict  governments  (DGs).  The  administration  functions  that  have  been  devolved  include \nadministration of schools and colleges, recruitment of staff up to Basic Pay Scale-16, and intra-\ndistrict transfer of staff. The devolved planning functions include the opening of new schools \nand colleges, upgrading of colleges and schools, preparation of district budgets, approval of \ndistrict development schemes up to PRs20 million, and purchase of stores and capital goods \n   ", "  7\nfor  devolved  institutions.  The  academic  functions  that  are  now  with  DGs  include  the \nmanagement of SC affairs, conduct of class 5 and 7 examinations, and scholarship grants to \nhigh achievers. However, it is important to clarify the roles and responsibilities by level, given \nthe considerable overlap of functions between province and district. \n \n25.  The main concerns relate to three areas: (i) rationalization of staff in terms of teacher-\nstudent  ratio;  (ii) increasing  resources  for  nonsalary  recurrent  expenditures  for  instructional \nmaterials, regular training, operation and maintenance, and supervision and monitoring, some of \nwhich  are  happening  through  SCs;  and  (iii) interdistrict  transfer  of  staff  up  to  Basic  Pay  \nScale-16. The major policy area is the rationalization of staff covering the following aspects: \n(i) setting  standards  for  creating  desirable  student-teacher  ratio  including  gender  focus  for \nelementary and high school education; (ii) for primary education, the approved teacher-student \nratio is 1:40, which has implications for quality education; and (iii) developing a medium-term \npolicy to implement the reforms. The other areas needing policy attention include (i) delegating \nauthority  to  DGs  for  strengthening  management  of  educational  institutions  (schools  and \ncolleges); (ii) strengthening monitoring arrangements for regulation of the private sector under \nthe rules approved by the Department of Education; and (iii) creating enabling environments for \neffective functioning of SCs, including administrative powers, to effectively manage human \nresources and school operations.  \n \n6.  Health, Nutrition, and Population Welfare \n \n26.  Despite significant efforts, progress toward achieving health-related MDGs has not been \nencouraging in Pakistan. Under 5, infant, and maternal mortality rates are unacceptably high; \nmalnutrition is a major contributor to infant and maternal deaths. Urgent and additional efforts \nare therefore necessary to increase the likelihood of Pakistan achieving the maternal and child- \nmortality-related MDGs. The public health sector remains severely underfunded. Although 4.1% \nof GDP is currently spent on health, only 0.7% of this comes from public spending and the \nremaining from out-of-pocket private expenditures. Per capita annual health expenditure is \nabout $18. The public sector per capita provision is about $3.17, which is equivalent to the \naverage amount spent on the treatment of fever in public health facilities.11  \n \n27.  In Punjab, if PG were to fully subsidize the health care for one third of people living \nbelow the poverty line at the international minimum of $30 per person per annum and the \nremaining two thirds pay for the actual cost of services, federal resources and development \npartner assistance will fall short annually by about PRs32.2 billion. The P-PRSP, however, \nprojects a lower shortfall for next 3 years, which may be underestimating the full need of \ndelivering an essential package of health services to the poor. However, the resource gap can \nbe partly bridged through efficiency gains as well as additional fiscal inputs into the basic \npackage of health services.  \n \n28.  The policy environment during the last few years in Pakistan generally and Punjab \nspecifically has been encouraging. The National Health Policy 200112 focuses on health sector \ninvestments as part of poverty reduction, and accords priority to primary and secondary care \ndelivery  systems.  The  Interim  Population  Sector  Perspective  Plan13  states  population \nstabilization as a means of achieving the goals of the PRSP, and proposed targets of reducing \n                                                        \n11 The Social Audit of Governance and Delivery of Public Services Survey 2002 (CIET Study) reported that 97% of \npatients in Punjab province visiting public health facilities spend an average of Rs184 on the treatment of fever. \n12 Ministry of Health.

Related  targets  include:  (i) increase  in \ncontraceptive prevalence rate to 57% by 2012; (ii) sustained increase in the age of marriage for \ngirls; and (iii) decrease in population growth rate to 1.6% by 2012. PG, under the P-PRSP, \nenvisages implementing a policy framework in line with the National Health Policy 2001 and the \nNational Population Policy 2002. The P-PRSP pledges to achieve targets set under the MDGs \nto reduce infant and child mortality, improve immunization of children, increase the proportion of \nbirths attended by health professionals, improve the contraceptive prevalence rate, and reduce \ntotal  fertility.  The  P-PRSP  highlighted  the  following  strategies  for  improving  health  status: \n(i) strengthening primary health care services with a focus on women, the poor, rural areas, and \nslums; (ii) providing adequate referral backup services including emergency care; (iii) training \nand retaining of medical staff to improve quality of services; (iv) addressing gender imbalance, \nboth  in  provision  and  delivery  of  services;  (v) encouraging  public-private  partnerships;  and \n(vi) granting administrative autonomy to teaching hospitals. \n \n29.  The PLGO has devolved the following four functions of the health sector to DGs: basic \nand rural health, child and women health, hospitals up to district level, and population welfare. \nThe  last,  though  a  vertical  program  and  continues  to  be  federally  funded  and provincially \nmanaged. However, there is a functional relationship with the executive district officer of health \nfor provision of family planning services. The federal Ministry of Health also supports preventive \nprograms through tied grants, and the system is well streamlined. The management staff of the \nhealth sector at district level is generally well trained in public health and management.  \n \n30.  The main challenges in advancing devolution are related to: control by the PG on staff \nappointments and posting and transfers; use of delegation of the financial powers rules of 1990; \nlack of alignment of the number and types of services and staff with the burden of disease; and \npoor internal monitoring controls by committees set under the PLGO. A few public-private \npartnership initiatives are being implemented, and need to be evaluated and systematically \nexpanded based on the evaluation outcomes. The district-wise multiple indicator cluster surveys \nare likely to be available by the end of 2004. The surveys\u2019 results would guide the districts for \neffecting improvements in planning and management of the health sector. Finally, a formal or \ninformal system for regulating the private health sector is lacking. \n \n7.  Water Supply and Sanitation \n \n31.  PG aims to improve access to water and sanitation services. The 10-year Perspective \nPlan targets provision of safe water to an additional 34.2 million people (26.5 million in rural \nareas) and sanitation to 22.2 million (13.6 million in rural areas). Ongoing programs include two \nADB-funded projects (Southern Punjab Basic Urban Services Project and Punjab Community \nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Project) (para. 19): the first benefiting 2.3 million rural \npeople in 54 tehsils of 26 districts, and the second 21 urban areas of southern Punjab. In the \nnext few 2-3 years, PG plans to operationalize 408 water supply schemes, improve quality \nassurance, and build the capacity of TMAs. Since 2001/02, 116 TMAs have been implementing \nneeds-based schemes from their own budgets and with the participation of their citizens. In \naddition to expanded coverage, future sector priorities include the development of a provincial \nstrategic plan and integrated master plans with prioritized rolling programs for each TMA, and \ncommunity motivation and organization of WUCs. \n \n32.  The PLGO created TMAs through the merger of staff of defunct urban councils and \nprovincial departments of Local Government and Rural Development (LG&RD) and Housing \nand Urban Development Planning and Public Health Engineering Department (HUD&PHED). \nTMAs  are  mandated  to  provide  municipal  services  including  water  supply  and  sanitation. \n   ", "  9\nHUD&PHED transferred 122 field staff to TMAs and retained higher-tier staff in four regional \nunits and, at the provincial level, kept powers of technical sanction of schemes costing more \nthan PRs5 million, and direct implementation of the ADB-financed WSS project (para. 19). \nPrivate, formal sector involvement is limited to partnerships in solid waste management in urban \nareas  and  notable  but  small-scale  partnerships  in  sanitation.  In  brackish  groundwater  and \nwater-short rural areas and small towns, water vending through informal small providers is \ncommon. All construction works are carried out through private enterprises. \n \n33.  The WSS sector faces a number of interrelated challenges. These range from weak \ntechnical and operational practices inherited by TMAs from their predecessors to those relating \nto TMAs\u2019 exclusive mandate for planning and delivery of services in urban and rural areas in \ntheir jurisdiction; the unfinished agenda for devolution (technical sanction and administrative \napproval powers, service cadre, performance grants, etc.) and the threat of reassumption of \npowers by the authorities from which they were devolved; and the need for strategic direction, \nparticularly focused on operation and maintenance, water quality monitoring, and increased \nsanitation coverage. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities  \n \n34.  Slow  Pace  of  Devolution.  The  PLGO  became  effective  in  2001.  As  explained  in \nSupplementary Appendix A, much remains to be done to strengthen the capacity of LGs, clarify \nroles and responsibilities of LGs, realign intergovernment relations between the PG and LGs, \nand ensure increased and predictable funding to LGs to meet social services needs. While the \nLGs  are  now  responsible  for  the  delivery  and  management  of  social  services,  their \nadministrative and financial authority is not commensurate with the assigned responsibility. PG \nhas a key role in supporting LGs by (i) providing TA for capacity building; (ii) establishing \npolicies, procedures, and minimum standards for service delivery; (iii) ensuring timely transfer of \nsufficient fiscal resources; and (iv) undertaking monitoring and evaluation to ensure minimum \nstandards of services and improved service delivery. The PG has a critical role in providing the \nenabling  environment  for  the  LGs  to  improve  their  functional,  financial,  and  managerial \nautonomy in line with the PLGO, so as to empower LGs to improve social services. It is \nessential to institutionalize LG councils and committees to make LGs\u2019 monitoring systems more \neffective, transparent, and accountable.     \n \n35.  LGs are facing major challenges to rationalize devolved social services in line with local \nneeds and improve quality and sustainability of social services. The related issues include lack \nof clarity in roles and responsibilities of LGs and provincial line departments (PLDs), dual control \non appointments and transfers, restricted financial autonomy, absence of a culture of public-\nprivate  partnerships  (PPPs),  fiscal  constraints,  and  capacity  issues.  LGs  lack  appropriate \nfinancial and administrative powers to use their budgets optimally. LGs\u2019 staffing and thus their \nrecurrent budgets have no relation with funding needs; hence the same allocation would have \ndifferent impacts in different locations. LGs have faced problems in recruiting staff because of \nrecruitment bans. Thus there is a need for increasing the fiscal transfers to LGs, giving LG \nadministrative and financial authority, improving management capacity and procedures, and \ndeveloping partnerships with local communities. Most of these issues fall in the domain of the \nlocal  government  commission  (LGC)  and  provincial  finance  commission  (PFC)  processes, \nwhich need strengthening.  \n \n36.  Staffing  and  Local  Needs.  LGs  inherited  social  sectors  that  largely  benefited  the \nnonpoor  and  urban  population  and  were  poorly  staffed  in  rural  and  hard-to-reach  areas. \nUtilization rates were low, particularly among the poor, women, and children. The quality and \n     \n ", "10  \ncapacity of service delivery have been hampered largely due to past recruitment bans resulting \nin vacancies in essential positions and the absence of a mechanism to provide appropriate \nincentives to qualified staff to work in disadvantaged locations where the needs are most acute. \nCurrent  staffing  at  the  PLDs  and  LGs  is  not  in  line  with  priority  services.  This  situation \nparticularly applies to the health sector.  \n \n37.  The  new  environment  presents  opportunities  for  the  LGs  to  effectively  plan  and \nimplement  social sector services and undertake alternative ways of improving  access and \nquality of social services for rural areas and the vulnerable populations, especially women and \nchildren. Some options include setting differential pay packages to attract staff to work in remote \nareas; developing a cadre of village-based midwives who work on self-employment; contracting \nout  management  of  health  and  education  facilities  to  the  private  sector  and  NGOs;  and \nencouraging  CCBs,  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  and  WUCs  to  invest  in  and \nmanage the social sector services. \n \n38.  Given that only a little over 20% women constitute the total workforce and representation \nof women in higher-level managerial positions is less than 5%, a gender-sensitive environment14 \nis clearly missing. The health and education sectors have a shortage of female staff, especially \nin rural and hard-to-reach areas. PG is committed to increasing the enrollment of girls in primary \nand secondary education, the proportion of female teachers, and access of women to health \ncare. PG is also committed to major gender reforms planned under the Punjab GRAP. \n \n39.  Monitoring Mechanisms. Monitoring mechanisms are weak at all levels and are not \neffective in supporting improvements in governance and the performance of social sectors. \nAlthough  the  PLGO  provides  for  the  establishment  of  monitoring  committees  of  local \ngovernment institutions at all three levels, these are not yet fully functional, especially at TMA \nand union administration levels. The rules of business for functioning of monitoring committees, \nthough prepared, have not yet been notified. However, PG is now making efforts to provide \ntransport facilities and additional staff to strengthen monitoring at the LG level. \n \n40.  Community and Private Sector Involvement. While the PLGO promotes public-private \npartnerships and opportunities for community-led service delivery by mandating both DGs and \nTMAs to set aside 25% of their annual development budget for use by CCBs on local priorities, \nthe participation of civil society structures is limited and only a few CCBs are active in most \ndistricts. School management committees have been reorganized into SCs and given resources \nand authority to supervise school affairs. PESRP is supporting the formation, composition of \nmembers, and functions of SCs in six of the 34 districts in Punjab through NGO involvement to \nenhance the effectiveness of SCs. Similarly, WUCs exist to manage water supply schemes. \nHowever, LGs, civil society, and the private sector require an appropriate enabling environment \nto expand, strengthen, and sustain their partnerships to deliver improved social services. This \nincludes incorporating lessons learned from ongoing initiatives. \n \n41.  The private sector is a major provider of health, education, and WSS services, especially \nin urban areas. The private health sector provides a large volume of outpatient care, mostly \nthrough low cost solo-practitioners, where the quality of care is questionable. It also provides \ninpatient services but only in large urban centers and at very high cost. In education, the private \nsector continues to grow and accounts for over 30% of overall school enrollment. Although rules \nfor the regulation of private schools have been framed, DGs oversee only the initial registration \nof new schools. Thus, there is an urgent need to review current regulatory procedures to assure \n                                                        \n14 For example, absence of toilets for women at the work place and transport services. \n   ", "  11\nthe quality of services provided by the private sector. The public sector can also develop \npartnerships with the private sector and civil society to deliver social services. Some partnership \nexperiments, such as contracting \u2013in and/or out management services, expanding services \nthrough NGOs using health and education foundations, the private sector holding evening \nclasses  in  public  schools,  encouraging  participation  of  CCBs  and  WUCs,  and  giving \nautonomous status to some hospitals are already working. However, these initiatives require \nmore support to be sustained. \n \n42.  Lessons  Learned.  The  lessons  learned  from  the  Second  Social  Action  Program15 \nimplementation as presented in Supplementary Appendix B have been carefully reviewed to \ndevelop a robust design for Punjab Devolved Social Services Program (PDSSP). According to \nthe  project  completion  report  of  the  Second  Social  Action  Program,  the  project  design, \nappropriateness, and likelihood of success have a direct relationship with (i) the political system, \nwhich is well defined and appropriate; (ii) clearer roles and responsibilities at various levels of \ngovernment; (iii) difficulty of implementing institutional reforms in isolation without addressing \npoor governance; and (iv) simple design and modest scope of the project if implementation \ncapacity  is  weak.  The  devolved  system  under  the  PLGO  provides  good  opportunities  to \nimplement PDSSP, as the three-tier political system of LGs is well crafted and backed by a \nnumber of council committees with a built-in system of transparency and public voice and \npressures. The PDSSP design creates a balance between institutional reforms and governance \nissues, is not complex, and is supported by a package of TA to address institutional and \ngovernance issues. The PG has agreed during the formulation of PDSSP to flexible financing of \nsocial sectors to address gaps in service delivery, target the poor and vulnerable including \nchildren and women, capacity building, and monitoring and evaluation. PDSSP will complement \nother externally funded programs in Appendix 3. \n \n43.  PDSSP follows (and has benefited from) the basic design principles adopted by the \nSindh Devolved Social Services Program16 in terms of the main policy outcomes and conditional \ngrants mechanism. In addition, PDSSP has incorporated lessons learned from Sindh\u2019s program: \n(i) approval of Planning Commission Performa-1 for the TA component by loan effectiveness to \nexpedite the use of consultants; (ii) more carefully designed TA component to target support for \npolicy actions and capacity building under PDSSP at the provincial and LG levels; and (iii) more \ntimely and active involvement of the PFC in coordinating the conditional grants mechanism to \nensure more effective use of funds by the participating LGs.17 Supplementary Appendix C \nprovides a comparison between the Sindh program and PDSSP. \n \n44.  Extensive  stakeholder  consultations  were  undertaken  during  the  design  phase  of \nPDSSP.  ADB  financed  TA  and  staff  consultants  for  the  analysis  of  sector-specific  and \ncrosscutting  issues.  The  TA  team  developed  a  program  approach  through  stakeholder \nconsultations at provincial and regional workshops. The project completion report of the Second \nSocial Action Program (para. 43), the reports on progress made in social sectors since the \nimplementation of PLGO, and the DSP also provided important insights on the implications of \n                                                        \n15 ADB. 1996.

A continuing dialogue with stakeholders at all levels, both \nthrough consultants and ADB Management, during PDSSP implementation would be necessary \nto ensure effective implementation of PDSSP.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n45.  The overall goal of PDSSP is to achieve progress on MDGs related to poverty, gender, \neducation, health, and WSS. The program objective is to strengthen devolved social services for \na more equitable, efficient, effective, and sustainable delivery of social services in line with the \nPLGO. In order to achieve the goal and objective, it will be necessary to (i) increase funding to \nsocial  sectors  to  expand  access  to  health  services,18  especially  for  women  and  children, \nincrease school enrollment rates, and improve access to WSS facilities; (ii) move away from \nprovincially-driven to demand-driven programs that are identified and implemented by LGs in \nline with P-PRSP, MTBF and provincial strategic plans and guidelines to achieve MDGs; and \n(iii) enhance the capacity of LGs to assume new roles and responsibilities in social services as \nenvisaged under the PLGO, including participatory planning, implementation, and monitoring \nand evaluation.  \n \n46.  The proposed policy matrix explicitly reinforces the transfer of powers to the LGs, e.g., \nstrengthening of planning processes, further devolution of administrative and financial powers to \nLGs, empowerment of LG monitoring committees, empowerment of females, and transfer of \nadditional funds to LGs to improve the equity and quality of social services. The road map to \nmove  from  the  current  stage  to  the  next  stage  is  articulated  in  the  three  principal  policy \noutcomes that PDSSP seeks to support: (i) realigning intergovernment relations to support \ndevolved social services, (ii) rationalizing and setting minimum standards for social services, \nand  (iii) strengthening  public  accountability  mechanisms  and  promoting  public-private \npartnership (PPP).   \n \n47.  The TA component will support activities in line with the program framework and policy \nmatrix in the following broad areas: (i) capacity building of LGs; (ii) partnership development \nwith private sector including NGOs, CBOs, and WUCs; (iii) sector-specific policy reforms; and \n(iv) planning,  programming,  management,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  TA  will  be \nprovided for a period of 4 years.  \n \n48.  PDSSP will be implemented in close coordination with other ongoing poverty reduction \nand reform programs that support the devolved system under the PLGO, such as DSP, PRMP, \nAccess to Justice Program, PESRP, and GRAP in the areas of accounting, auditing, institutional \nstrengthening,  monitoring,  social  sector  reforms,  governance,  PPP,  and  mainstreaming  of \ngender concerns. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n \n49.  The policy matrix is in Appendix 4 and the development policy letter is in Appendix 5. \nThe policy outcomes and related policy actions are summarized below. \n \n \n                                                        \n18 Includes reproductive health and nutrition services. \n   ", "  13\n \n  1.   Realigning Intergovernment Relations to Support Devolved Social Services \n \n50.  PG will introduce the necessary policy changes in the social sector to support the \ndevolution  process.  PLDs  (DOE,  DOH,  Department  of  Special  Education  [DOSE],  and \nHUD&PHED)  will  establish  a  consultative  process  to  formulate  and  disseminate  5-year \nprioritized strategic plans for their respective sector. The strategic plans will be implemented by \nthe participating LGs and PLDs, and will delineate clearly the roles and responsibilities of PG \nand participating LGs. Each DG and program TMA will develop annual sector plans. At least \n75% of DGs and 50% of program TMAs will develop 3-year sector rolling plans consistent with \nthe 5-year strategic plans. The 3-year rolling plans will identify local priorities and will help \nprovide  predictability  to  funding  priorities.  The  institutional  analysis  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n51.  The financial and administrative powers of the LGs will also be enhanced. LG&RD will \nlead the process of identifying gaps in implementation and the further devolution of financial and \nadministrative  powers  to  LGs.  The  capacity  of  TMAs  will  be  enhanced  to  further  devolve \nfinancial and administrative powers.  \n  \n52.  Each  participating  LG  will  enter  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  for \nconditional grants with PG. The MOU will, among other things, state (i) the eligibility and access \ncriteria  for  DGs  and  program  TMAs  to  qualify  for  and  access  the  loan  proceeds;  (ii) the \nobligations and responsibilities of PG, DGs, and program TMAs; (iii) a negative list to prevent \nthe loan proceeds from being utilized for nonbasic devolved social services; and (iv) a set of \nbenchmarks to monitor the progress made by DGs and program TMAs. The draft MOU is in \nSupplementary Appendix E. \n \n53.  The purpose of the conditional grants is to provide incentives to DGs and program TMAs \nto  undertake  reforms  in  the  social  sectors,  including  increasing  allocations  and  prioritizing \nexpenditures  in  the  social  sectors.  The  conditional  grants  will  be  tied  to  fulfilling  certain \nconditions associated with intended reforms, including (i) increased expenditure levels (total, \nsalary, and nonsalary); (ii) improved gender representation and mainstreaming; (iii) promotion of \nPPPs (percentage funds utilized for PPPs); (iv) improved indicators (process-related, such as \ntimely release of funds; output-related such as percentage of completed schemes in the annual \ndevelopment plan, levels of enrollment particularly of girls and disadvantaged children; and \noutcome-related  such  as  completion  rates  and  utilization  rates);  and  (v) timely  accounting, \nauditing, and reporting. (The use of conditional grants is discussed in Appendix 6.) \n \n  2.   Rationalizing and Setting Minimum Standards for Social Services  \n \n54.  The development and enforcement of service standards is an important instrument for \nimproving the quality of social services using evidence-based interventions. By establishing \nclear, objective, and agreed performance benchmarks and explicitly defining expectations in \nterms of inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes, the PG can provide the enabling framework \nfor more effective and efficient service delivery at the LG level. Social services currently lack \nfocus on poor and vulnerable groups, and on women. PG will assess the quality and relevance \nof existing social services vis-\u00e0-vis these groups, set pro-poor and gender-sensitive minimum \nservice delivery and technical standards in consultation with LGs, and assist LGs to rationalize \nservice provision. This will include targeting the poor within the social sector. PG, in consultation \nwith LGs, will develop guidelines and criteria to select pro-poor activities for annual sector plan \nand through PPPs.  \n     \n ", "14  \n \n55.  With  a  view  to  improving  the  quality  and  capacity  of  services,  especially  in \ndisadvantaged locations, PG will review the existing situation and regulations pertaining to \nappointment, transfer, promotion, and will introduce reforms to fill all essential vacancies. The \ncurrent staffing at the PLDs and LGs is not in line with the priority services. This situation \napplies particularly to the health sector. DOH will rationalize the staff mix and the skills mix at \nprimary care and tehsil hospitals in line with the prevailing burden of disease. This will also \ninclude rationalization of management staff to improve management and performance of key \nsubsystems, such as reproductive and child health services. Staff availability in hard-to-reach \nareas  will  be  ensured  through  better  incentives  and  facility-based  recruitment,  as  PG  has \nagreed to introduce differential contract pay packages to attract technical staff in such areas. \nPG  has  already  developed  and  approved  the  Punjab  GRAP  and  will  mainstream  its \nimplementation, with a focus on increasing representation of female members in the department \nselection committees up to 25%19 and on raising quotas for women\u2019s recruitment in the health \nand education sectors. In support of the overall GRAP framework, the Program will seek to \nintroduce gender sensitivity in planning and budgeting decisions, through specific requirements \nsuch as inclusion of women on relevant council committees and providing incentives for the \ninclusion of gender-specific investments in the annual sector and 3-year rolling plans. The staff \nrationalization plans will be integrated into the strategic plans and LGs\u2019 3-year rolling plans. \n \n  3.   Strengthening Public Accountability Mechanisms and Promoting Public-\nPrivate Partnerships  \n \n56.  To improve governance, PDSSP will support the proposed monitoring mechanisms to \nimprove the performance of the social sectors. PLDs, in consultation with LGs and under the \noverall  guidance  and  leadership  of  the  LGC,  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  review  of \nmonitoring systems in the social sectors at all levels, in order to develop and implement a \nmonitoring  strategy.  This  intervention  is  expected  to  further  strengthen  and  institutionalize \nmonitoring in the social sectors at all levels, including third party evaluations. Improvements in \nmonitoring will include strengthening management information systems, ensuring access to \nmore timely and reliable information, putting information on the web for easy access by the \npublic,  sharing  findings  from  third  party  evaluations,  and  implementing  a  behavior  change \ncommunication campaign that informs citizens of the reasons for poor social indicators.  \n \n57.  PDSSP will provide support to make operational the monitoring committees of local \ngovernment institutions. The bye-laws for LGs\u2019 monitoring committees will be approved, and \nLGs\u2019 committees at three levels will be made effective. Monitoring criteria to be used will be \ntransparent and objective. PDSSP will help to make council committees functional and ensure \ncitizen participation in LG forums, e.g., SCs, CCBs, and village councils. PDSSP will establish \ninformation flows on service standards, budgets, charters, management reports, and studies, for \nwider public information and effective citizen participation. \n \n58.  PDSSP will support PG in undertaking a comprehensive review of policy options for \nPPPs. Given that both the health and education sectors have significant involvement of the \nprivate sector, PG and LGs can benefit from different forms of PPPs, including the operation of \nthe Health Foundation, provision of autonomy to some district hospitals, and involvement of \nNGOs,  CBOs,  or  CCBs  in  the  management  of  public  health  facilities  and/or  promotion  of \nalternative service delivery mechanisms. All of these initiatives could be replicated to improve \nsocial  services  and  could  be  supported  through  conditional  grants.  PG  will  develop  a \n                                                        \n19 At present none, except executive district officer in five districts as committee members.  \n   ", "  15\ncomprehensive policy on PPPs in the social sectors through a consultative process to enable \nLGs to implement various models of PPPs in line with the local environment as part of 3-year \nrolling plans. The policy on PPPs, with a focus on health and the WSS sector, will be prepared \nin consultation with LGs and approved by PG. Guidelines will be prepared to allow NGOs, \nCBOs,  and  CCBs  to  seek  proposals  for  partnership  with  public  sector  institutions  to  offer \nalternative forms of service delivery and/or to enhance existing public social service provision. \nBased on the policy on PPPs, PG will support LGs in strengthening and institutionalizing PPPs \nin social service delivery at all levels. PDSSP funds will be used to finance proposals for \nexpanding  service  delivery.  PDSSP  will  also  support  facility-based  committees  for  health \nfacilities, especially at tehsil and district hospitals, to improve their operation for better quality \nservices, particularly to underserved constituencies.  \n \n59.  With the standards to be introduced, the monitoring system to be strengthened, and the \npolicy  on  PPP  to  be  developed,  PG  and  LGs,  with  support  from  PDSSP,  will  be  able  to \nstrengthen their quality assurance functions. TA will be available for capacity-building initiatives, \nand for strengthening and institutionalizing quality assurance. For instance, the HUD&PHED \nwants to focus on expanding water-testing capacity, including bacteriological testing. \n \nC.  Important Features \n \n60.  This is the first ADB-supported program loan for the social sectors in Punjab. PDSSP \nprimarily supports more effective implementation of social sector programs in line with the \nPLGO  under  the  new  three-tier  governance  structure  of  the  LG  system.  PDSSP,  besides \nproviding additional finances, has a number of special features to: (i) support devolution; (ii) \nimprove  intergovernment  relationships;  (iii)  support  PFC  processes  to  make  funding  more \npredictable and transparent; (iv) develop partnerships to support alternative mechanisms of \nservice delivery, and (v) support policy reforms to align national, provincial and district priorities \nto  achieve  progress  on  MDGs.  The  PDSSP  design  includes  interventions  for  PPP  and  a \ncitizens\u2019 role in monitoring to ensure improved governance through community participation and \ntransparency, with a consequent impact on quality and efficiency of social services. \n \n61.   PDSSP  has  been  designed  through  participatory  methods  and  by  integrating \n(i) consumer perspectives through focus group discussions, (ii) provider perspectives through \nregional workshops, and (iii) district manager perspectives through discussions and meetings \nwith planners and policy makers. PDSSP thus provides an opportunity for the LGs to prioritize \nand implement basic social services in line with their needs and within the framework of the \nPLGO. \n \n62.  PDSSP makes special provisions for protecting poor and vulnerable groups, including \nwomen. The design and implementation of pro-poor service delivery packages will ensure \ngreater benefit to the poor and marginalized population. PDSSP will provide better access to \nhealth facilities for the poor, rural populations, women, and children. It will create educational \nfacilities for handicapped children and for girls in less affluent districts. The expansion of the \neducation  system  for  girls  will  help  in  expanding  the  pool  of  female  students  to  become \nschoolteachers, nurses, midwives,  and doctors. PDSSP also directs expenditures to make \nprogress on the MDGs that largely benefits the poor and women. Similarly, WSS schemes will \nmostly benefit small villages and population clusters. \n \n63.  PDSSP  includes  unique  mechanisms  to  strengthen  the  PFC  process  to  provide \nconditional grants to LGs. PG will include conditional grants as part of the PFC award from the \nsecond  year  to  channel  funds  to  LGs  based  on  a  predictable  and  transparent  formula.  \n     \n ", "16  \nConditional grants are flexible grants to participating LGs that would enable them to improve \nplanning,  prioritization,  allocation,  and  utilization  of  funds,  based  on  local  conditions  and \npriorities to achieve progress on social sector indicators.  \n \n64.  PDSSP explores synergies with other ongoing programs, such as the ADB-supported \nDSP and PRMP, aimed at supporting decentralization and governance reforms, accounting, \nbudgeting and auditing, operationalizing P-PRSP priorities, and strengthening the MTBF for \npredictable and sustainable funding. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n65.  The Government has requested two loans: a program loan of $75 million equivalent from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF])  and  a  program  loan  of \n$75 million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR).  In  addition,  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom, through the Department of International Development \n(DFID) will provide grant assistance, to be administered by ADB, in an amount equivalent to \n$30 million (DFID grant) for budgetary support to PG. The loans and DFID grant will support the \npolicy reforms as described in the development policy letter and the policy matrix. The resource \ncost of reform is estimated at $200 million equivalent over 3 years for policy reforms, reorienting \nexpenditures  toward  pro-poor  services,  filling  essential  vacancies,  sustaining  increased \ninvestments in the social sectors, promoting PPPs, augmenting and sustaining budgetary needs \n(both recurrent and development) of participating LGs for social services, and capacity building.  \n \n66.  The ADF loan of approximately $75 million equivalent will have a term of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; an interest of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter; and other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Program \nAgreements.  \n \n67.  The OCR amount was reinstated after PG\u2019s request and the Government\u2019s approval. \nThe OCR loan will have a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate \nto  be  determined  in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, including a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program  Agreements.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n68.  The  loans  are  justified  by  the  content  and  expected  impact  of  policy  reforms  and \nassociated costs as part of the MTBF. Appendix 7 provides the social sector financing plan in \nPunjab. The Government has agreed to relend the proceeds of the loans to PG in domestic \ncurrency, on the same terms and conditions, as are applicable to the Borrower. The foreign \nexchange risk will be borne by PG. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n  \n69.  The  Planning  and  Development  Department,  Punjab  (P&DD)  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency (EA). The P&DD, acting through the provincial steering committee (PSC), will monitor \nthe program and will provide overall program coordination, and policy and strategic guidance. \n   ", "  17\nThe  PSC  will  be  headed  by  the  chairman,  P&DD  and  will  comprise  (i) secretary,  DOF; \n(ii) secretary,  DOH;  (iii) secretary,  DOE;  (iv) secretary,  DOSE;  (v) secretary,  HUD&PHED; \n(vi) secretary, LG&RD; (vii) secretary, Department of Women Development and Social Welfare; \n(viii) program directors from PRMP and DSP; and (ix) two representatives from NGOs. The PSC \nmay co-opt other members as appropriate. At least two members of the PSC will be women. PG \nhas also established an oversight committee chaired by the chief secretary to review progress \nmade by different projects and programs. Appendix 8 provides the program implementation \norganization.  Supplementary  Appendix  F  provides  a  list  of  program  implementation \nresponsibilities.  \n \n70.  DOH  will  be  the  lead  implementing  agency.  DOE,  DOSE,  HUD&PHED,  DGs,  and \nprogram TMAs will act as additional implementing agencies. DOH will house the program \nsupport unit (PSU) that will serve as the secretariat of the PSC and will comprise (i) a program \ndirector;  (ii) focal  officials  from  each  of  the  DOH,  DOE,  DOSE,  and  HUD&PHED;  and \n(iii) consultants to be identified under the TA. The PSU will provide (i) operational coordination \nand technical support to the DOH, DOE, DOSE, HUD&PHED, and the local support groups  \n(LSGs);  and  (ii) support  to  the  DOH,  DOE,  DOSE,  and  HUD&PHED  in  the  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring of sector-specific policy reforms. One LSG will be established in \neach  DG  which  will  provide  technical  support  to  DGs  and  program  TMAs  to  assume \nresponsibilities for NGOs, CBOs, and CCBs as development partners and to monitor their \nactivities. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n71.  The program support and policy reforms will be implemented over a period of 3 years. \nThe program period will be from 31 March 2005 to 31 March 2008. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n72.  The loan proceeds will finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced in and \nprocured from ADB member countries, excluding listed ineligible items and imports financed by \nother multilateral and bilateral sources. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. Appendix 9 lists the ineligible \nitems. The Borrower will certify that (i) if the loan proceeds finance goods already imported, the \nvolume of eligible imports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested \nwithdrawal; or (ii) if the loan proceeds finance items to be imported, the value of the eligible \nimports in the immediately preceding 1-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount \nof the requested withdrawal plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn from the loan \naccount during the succeeding 1-year period. The program loans will be used for 3 years, \nnamely  31  March  2005\u201331  March  2008.  Disbursement  will  be  made  under  the  simplified \nprocedures for program loans, approved by ADB\u2019s Board on 16 April 1998. The Government \nand  PG  will  certify  the  utilization of  counterpart  funds  in  line  with  the  Loan  and  Program \nAgreements through audited statements acceptable to ADB. \n  \n4.  Tranching and Counterpart Funds \n \n73.  Counterpart funds generated by loan proceeds will be used to provide budgetary support \nfor devolved social services. The ADF loan of $75 million equivalent, OCR loan of $75 million \nequivalent, and DFID grant for budgetary support of $30 million will be used over 3 years and \nreleased in three tranches with minimum 1-year intervals. The three tranches will be disbursed \nas follows upon fulfillment of the conditions shown in the policy matrix: (i) tranche 1: $80 million \n     \n ", "18  \nequivalent; ADF: $25 million; OCR: $40 million; DFID: $15 million; (ii) tranche 2: $55 million \nequivalent; ADF: $25 million; OCR: $20 million; DFID: $10 million; and (iii) tranche 3: $45 million \nequivalent; ADF: $25 million; OCR: $15 million; DFID: $5 million.  \n \n74.  In view of the level of current assistance already being received by the education and \nWSS sectors, PG has proposed that the ADF and OCR loans and DFID grant for budgetary \nsupport  be  distributed  among  the  three  sectors  in  the  following  ratio:  health  sector  65%, \neducation 17%, and WSS 18%. An analysis of social sector financing in Punjab confirms that \nthe financing gap in the health sector is the largest and thus requires more support, in line with \nPG\u2019s proposal. \n \n75.  PG will use the counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the policy loans and \ngrant to finance costs associated with implementing the P-PRSP and the devolution under \nPLGO. PG will include the counterpart funds in the provincial consolidated fund (rather than \noutside  the  budget),  under  the  provincial  allocable  component  for  onward  distribution  to \nparticipating LGs. PG will make available part of this budget support to DGs and program TMAs \nfor financing specific activities in the social sectors.  \n \n5.  Accounting and Auditing  \n \n76.  Prior to withdrawal, the Government will open a deposit account at the State Bank of \nPakistan  to  receive  all  loan  proceeds.  The  deposit  account  will  be  established,  managed, \noperated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. Each DG will deposit the \nloan proceeds in a civil account and each program TMA will deposit the loan proceeds in a local \nfund account for efficient tracking of the loan proceeds and have their respective accounts and \nrelated financial statements audited and annually by the District Audit Office of the Pakistan \nAuditor General. \n \n6.  Program Performance Management System  \n \n77.  PG,  in  consultation  with  participating  LGs,  will  design  a  program  performance \nmanagement system (PPMS) for systematic program monitoring and to feed into the quarterly \nand annual progress reports. The regular progress reports will track implementation of policy \nreforms, sector financing, expenditure reporting from participating LGs, allocation of counterpart \nfunds, formulation and implementation of annual plans, and staff appointments. PPMS will \ninclude benchmarking to compare progress made against a set of benchmarks prior to program \nimplementation,  to  strengthen  management  information  systems  such  as  the  health \nmanagement  information  system  and  the  educational  management  information  system  to \ninstitutionalize monitoring at all levels, to activate and strengthen institutional arrangements for \nmonitoring in line with the provisions under the PLGO, and to undertake independent third party \nsurveys20 to monitor outcome and impact indicators. District-based multiple indicator cluster \nsurveys  and national Pakistan integrated household surveys with province-wise information are \ngood examples of third party surveys that will help in comparing the change over time because \nof consistency of methodology and sample size. PPMS arrangements are explained further in \nAppendix 10.  \n  \n                                                        \n20 For example, Community Information Empowerment and Training, Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey, etc. \n   ", "  19\n7.  Program Review and Reporting \n \n78.  PG, acting through the PSC, will monitor the implementation of reforms agreed under \nthe  program.  The  PSU  will:  (a)  with  the  assistance  of  LSGs,  monitor  the  program,  on  a \ncontinuous basis; and (b) provide ADB with reports of the PPMS, on a quarterly basis. PG, in \nconjunction with ADB and DFID will: (a) conduct a comprehensive mid-term review with the \nassistance of an independent expert in the last quarter of the second (2) year of program \nimplementation to evaluate the progress with policy reforms including: (i) financial flows; (ii) the \nactivities of DGs and program TMAs; (iii) public-private initiatives; (iv) effectiveness of service \ndelivery; (v) allocations to and expenditures in social services; and (vi) coverage of services; \nand (b) prior to each tranche release, carry out a policy review to assess the achievement of the \npolicy reforms. Such review will use a participatory process including field visits. ADB and DFID \nwill conduct an inception mission, biannual review missions, and a program completion mission. \nDuring each mission, findings will be discussed with PG and an action plan will be agreed upon. \nADB will provide a full-time specialist at its Pakistan Resident Mission to strengthen regular \nsupervision. Monitoring will also be an ongoing exercise through the PSU and local support \ngroups  (LSGs),  and  through  support  from  DSP.  Monitorable  and  time-bound  actions  are \nreflected in the policy matrix. \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n79.  A TA component is proposed to support social service policy reforms under PDSSP and \nenhance  capacity  of  participating  LGs  to  improve  quality,  access,  efficiency,  and  cost-\neffectiveness of social services covering three sectors, namely health, education, and WSS. \n \nA.  Scope \n \n80.  The goal of the TA component is the same as the overall program goal: \u201cTo achieve \nprogress on MDGs related to poverty, gender, education, health, and water and sanitation.\u201d The \npurpose is for the PLDs and participating LGs to ensure effective delivery of social services \naccording to their mandate as described under the PLGO. \n \n81.  The  TA  component  will  provide  support  under  four  output  areas:  (i) the  timely  and \neffective processing of the Devolved Social Services policy matrix, conditional grants, and \ncapacity-building support; (ii) enhanced capacity of PG to take forward, on an ongoing basis, \nsocial sector policy development as specified in the policy matrix; (iii) increased capacity of LGs \nto  plan,  manage,  and  monitor  social  sector  development;  and  (iv) increased  capacity  of \ncommunities to work with PG to deliver services and hold it accountable for such delivery. \n \nB.  Components \n \n82.  Under the TA component, four consultants will be recruited to the PSU to assist the PSC \nin coordinating the three main features of PDSSP: (i) the policy matrix, (ii) the conditional grants, \nand (iii) the three remaining areas of the TA component. \n \n83.  The  TA  component  will  provide  consultant  support,  training,  and  other  learning \nopportunities on a flexible needs basis (managed through the procedure detailed in section D \nbelow) to support the PLDs in meeting the policy actions specified in the policy matrix. This will \ninclude  (i) strategic  planning  for  social  sectors  (the  development  of  strategic  sector  plans, \nsupported  by  sound  sector  economic  analysis  that  assesses  state  and  nonstate  service \nproviders; (ii) governance and institutional reforms required as part of the process of adjusting \n     \n ", "20  \ngovernment  institutions  following  devolution;  (iii) an  assessment  of  personnel  management, \nincluding supporting the implementation of recommendations; (iv) monitoring, reporting, and \nevaluation, especially ensuring the quality of information, supporting its use in decision making, \nand publicly disseminating information on the performance of services to empower community \ngroups to work with participating LGs, thereby making services more relevant to consumer \nneeds; and (v) technical dimensions of health and WSS policy, specifically in the areas of solid \nwaste, hazardous and infectious medical waste management, and sewage. \n \n84.  The TA component will support LG-level capacity building focusing on four key functions \nof LGs: (i) planning, (3-year rolling plans developed through a consultative process and building \non  situation  analyses);  (ii) developing  mechanisms  for  regulation  and  self-regulation  of  the \nprivate sector; (iii) supporting community participation and awareness campaigns in the areas of \nplanning  and  managing  service  delivery  improvements;  and  (iv) monitoring  and  reporting, \nincluding the activation of LG monitoring committees. \n \n85.  The  TA  will  mobilize  community  organizations  to  form  facility-based committees  for \nhealth services, WUCs, and SCs. This support will dovetail with support provided to participating \nLGs to strengthen the relationship between CBOs and participating LGs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n86.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  to  be  $25.0 million  equivalent,  comprising \n$3.2 million equivalent in foreign exchange costs and $21.8 million equivalent in local currency \ncosts.  The  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  through  DFID  will  finance  $20.0 million \nequivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost and $16.8 million equivalent in local \ncurrency, to be administered by ADB. This will provide 80% of the total cost of the TA, including \ninternational and domestic consultant services, and the cost of training programs, equipment, \nvehicles, and furniture. The Government will finance $5.0 million or 20% of the total TA cost, \nmainly  for  the  counterpart  budget  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  including \ncounterpart staff and facilities for the consulting team; taxes and duties on equipment, vehicles, \nand furniture; and taxes on consultants. The TA cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 11. \n \nD.  Implementing arrangements \n \n87.  Steering Committee. The steering committee for the TA will be the PSC. The PSC will \nbe the approving authority for annual TA plans submitted by the PLDs. \n \n88.  Executing Agency. P&DD will be the EA for the TA as well. The PSU will coordinate the \nTA on behalf of the EA and in close consultation with the PLDs and participating LGs.  \n \n89.  Implementation Period. The implementation period for the TA component is 4 years. \nThe implementation will continue a year after the closing of the program loans and DFID grant \nfor budgetary support. \n \n90.  Consulting  Services.  A  TA  management  firm  will  be  recruited  for  overall  TA \nmanagement according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants following quality and \ncost-based selection procedures. This contract will include the scope of those services identified \ninitially and those that will be required later during program implementation. Indicative terms of \nreference will be included in this contract. Subsequent deployment of domestic consultants will \nbe subject to the approval of the PSC. The TA is based on about 5,028 person-months of \n   ", "  21\nconsulting services (50 person-months international and 4,978 person-months domestic). A \nprovisional list of consultants with person-months is shown in Supplementary Appendix G. The \nprovisional list will be the starting point for PLDs and participating LGs to establish TA needs to \nmeet program requirements. PLDs and LGs with the support of the TA management firm will \nthereafter submit draft terms of reference (of a standard format provided by the PSU) to the \nPSC, through the PSU program coordinator. The PSC will agree to a final list of consultancy \nservices. The TA management firm will thereafter finalize the terms of reference (again in \nstandard format) with the PLDs, source and contract the services, and support the PLDs to \nmonitor the delivery of services. About four core consultants to be based at the PSU will be \nrecruited individually.  \n \n91.  Institutional Arrangements. Arrangements for competitively engaging reputed NGOs \nand academic institutions and firms will also be part of the scope of work of the management \nfirm. The firm will provide customized, relevant, capacity building within the social sector context \nand the PDSSP framework, including issues such as social sector planning and monitoring, \nquality assurance, client orientation in service delivery, and development of citizen charters.  \n \n92.  Procurement. Contract packages for $500,000 equivalent or less will follow international \nshopping procedures, except for vehicles, which may be procured through local competitive \nbidding. Minor packages costing $100,000 equivalent or less may be procured through local \ncompetitive bidding or direct purchase, as per PG standard procurement, acceptable to ADB.  \n \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Program Benefits \n \n93.  Institutionalized  Planning.  Social  sector  planning,  in  the  past,  was  ad  hoc  and \nnonparticipatory. After devolution, the planning and programming of the basic social services \nwere decentralized to LGs. However, LGs have limited planning capacity. The devolved social \nsector policy reforms include support for developing strategic plans, developing PPPs, and \nevolving self-regulation of the private sector. The capacity-building component is built into the \nTA project to support the PLDs and participating LGs. Simultaneously, the TA component will \nalso  address  institutionalization  of  strategic  planning  and  management  capacities  in \nparticipating LGs for sustainability of the initiatives. PDSSP will also establish synergy with other \nongoing reform programs, such as PRMP, DSP, and PESRP. \n \n94.  Social Sector Financing. PDSSP will provide funds to participating LGs for social \nsectors through Account IV, which is set up for LGs. Allocations to the social sectors will be in \nline with the MTBF estimates. The allocation and expenditure figures for FY 2003/04 will be \nused as benchmarks to monitor increases during the program period. PG will review the sector \nstrategies to align them with the P-PRSP, national commitments (Pakistan Health Policy, etc.), \nand international commitments (MDGs) to accelerate poverty reduction and achieve important \nmilestones in social development. A portion of the DFID grant will be reserved for encouraging \nan increased role of the private sector and NGOs in the delivery of social services under the \noverall stewardship of LGs. \n \n95.  Pro-Poor Social Services. At present, social services are not aligned with the burden of \ndisease, the needs of the poor and vulnerable, and to meet the MDGs. The program design \nincludes special features and policies that will facilitate the development and implementation of \nessential, pro-poor packages of services with a special focus on addressing child survival and \n     \n ", "22  \nmaternal health; improving access of girls to primary and middle schools and handicapped \nchildren to primary schools; and increasing access to potable drinking water and sanitation for \nthe poor. The intended beneficiaries include women, girls, children, handicapped people, and \nthe poor. Resources are available in the TA component to rationalize and strengthen social \nservices delivery and capacity building of LG staff, NGOs, and CBOs, to benefit the poor.  \n \n96.  Public-Private  and  Community  Partnerships.  PDSSP  will  support  PPPs  and \ncommunities  in  the  delivery  of  social  services.  PPPs,  to  be  developed  on  the  basis  of  a \ncomprehensive nongovernment/private sector partnership policy and piloting innovative and \ndifferent models of social service delivery, will open new avenues for delivering social services \nthrough NGOs, CBOs, CCBs, and WUCs. The TA component will build capacity of registered \nnot-for-profit organizations for developing viable social sector service delivery schemes and \ntheir management capacity, and support sound intervention schemes for them.  \n \nB.  Impacts  \n \n1.  Social Impact  \n \n97.  PDSSP will improve the quality of human capital for a large majority of the population of \nPunjab, especially the rural population, poor segments, and handicapped and vulnerable people \nby improved targeting. Better governance and realignment of roles and responsibilities of PLDs \nand LGs are expected to improve quality, efficiency, access, and cost-effectiveness of social \nservices. The improved quality of life will have a direct impact on improving the social sector \noutcomes and the achievement of MDGs as specified in the program framework, particularly \ninfant  and  child  mortality,  maternal  mortality,  and  a  broadening  of  the  pyramid  of  higher \neducational  achievements.  Through  pro-poor  sector  strategies  and  performance-based \ncontracting mechanisms between PG and LGs, the social services are expected to be made \nmore  accessible  to  the  poor  and  marginalized.  There  will  be  no  land  acquisition  and  or \nresettlement and if required, unoccupied government land will be utilized. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n2.  Gender  \n \n98.  Universal primary education and a focus on expanding middle education will benefit girls \nwhose enrollment still remains low. Higher enrollment of girls in primary and middle education \nwill  allow  more  girls  to  undertake  secondary  education,  which  is  strongly  associated  with \nreduction in infant and child mortality in rural areas. Improved access to and management of \npregnancy-related emergencies will not only help in lowering maternal mortality, but also help in \nbreaking the chain of family catastrophes. The implementation of the GRAP  (Appendix 10) will \nincrease access to social services by women. The implementation of the GRAP will be another \nwindow for mainstreaming women in the government structure and local bodies and improve the \nparticipation of women at management and decision-making levels. \n \n3.  Institutional Impact \n \n99.  PDSSP envisions institutional reforms to strengthen the newly established LG system. \nThe  reforms  will  institutionalize  improved  governance,  access  to  information,  and  citizens\u2019 \nparticipation  in  planning  of  social  services  to  help  improve  service  delivery.  PDSSP  will \nstrengthen the compact between policy makers (PG and LGs), service providers (LGs and their \nstaff),  and  consumers  (communities)  to  make  social  services  more  accountable  to  the \ncommunities  they  serve,  especially  the  disadvantaged  and  deprived  communities.  The \n   ", "  23\ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  policies  for  PPPs\u2014hospital  autonomy,  NGOs,  CBOs, \nWUCs\u2014will set new institutional arrangements for use of public funds through private sector \nparticipation. PDSSP interventions will also rationalize institutional structures for social sector \noversight,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation,  thereby  contributing  to  improved  social  sector \nplanning and management systems.  \n \n4.  Economic and Poverty Impact \n \n100.  The social sectors will benefit from PDSSP through conditional grants. These grants are \nin  addition  to  social  sector  investments  already  planned  by  PG  and  LGs.  The  additional \nresource envelope is mainly focused on the poor and vulnerable through delivery of essential \npro-poor  services.  The  expected  outputs  from  enhanced  investments  will  lead  to  human \ndevelopment by improving basic health and education, which in turn will provide impetus to \naccelerate economic growth and reduce poverty. In addition, by ensuring a focus on pro-poor \nsocial sector investments, the program loans also addresse important concerns of bridging wide \ngaps in income-based social development. Indirectly, better governance and the likely social \ndevelopment will have a strong positive impact on poverty reduction. A summary poverty and \nsocial analysis is in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n5.  Environmental Aspects \n \n101.  PDSSP is classified as environmental category B due to issues related to absence of \nservice standards for collection and disposal of hazardous and infectious medical waste, and \nenvironmental  hazards  resulting  from  poor  disposal  systems  for  sewage  and  solid  waste. \nPDSSP includes interventions related to improving the environmental aspects over the medium \nterm through developing and implementing standard procedures and protocols for collection and \ndisposal of hazardous wastes. PDSSP will recruit two consultants, one for medical wastes and \nthe other for WSS waste management, to provide TA to DGs and program TMAs to develop and \nimplement standard operating procedures for disposal of hazardous and infectious waste, and \nsupport training of related staff. The environmental assessment summary is in Supplementary \nAppendix I. \n \nC.  Risks and Assumptions \n \n1.  Political Risks \n \n102.  Many  reform  agreements,  including  the  structural  adjustment  facilities  of  the \nInternational Monetary Fund, ran into difficulty and were either delayed considerably or not fully \nimplemented due to political pressures or changes in Government. Lack of communication \nabout  policy  reforms  in  the  past  has  caused  stiff  opposition  to  reforms.  However,  risk  of \nopposition  to  reforms  at  the  political  level  is  much  less  apparent  in  Punjab  than  in  other \nprovinces because of a more stable political environment. This is demonstrated by smooth \nimplementation of PRMP. PDSSP has an attached TA component to ensure ownership and to \nkeep reforms on track through stakeholder participation. PDSSP is also designed within the \nPLGO  framework,  which  remains  a  major  priority  of  both  the  federal  and  provincial \ngovernments. \n \n2.  Governance Risks \n \n103.  A major focus of PDSSP is to improve social sector governance and lead to transparent \nand objective decision making to minimize rent seeking. As a result, there is a risk that reform \n     \n ", "24  \nimplementation might be delayed  or undermined by  vested interests. PDSSP includes the \nfollowing risk mitigation measures: building stakeholder ownership during the program design \nand implementation stages; establishing program oversight mechanisms including participation \nof LG council committees; and ensuring synergy with other reform programs such as PRMP, \nDSP, and PESRP.  \n \n3.  Capacity Constraints \n \n104.  Devolution of delivery of social sector services to LGs presents both a challenge and an \nopportunity. While devolution moves social sector planning, implementation, and monitoring \ncloser to beneficiaries, it also introduces an additional element of commitment and capacity \nproblems in terms of delivery. At present, the financial, managerial and technical capacity of \nLGs is limited and there would be limitations in effectively spending additional funds. LGs, on \nthe other hand, are best positioned to ensure that new interventions are designed and located \nappropriately and involve beneficiaries in the design of social services and user fees. These \nrisks will be mitigated by timely and appropriately designed capacity-building activities that will \nbe financed through the TA component.   \n \n4.  Macroeconomic and External Risks \n \n105.  PG has faced serious budget deficits in the past, and has a history of poor revenue \ncollection. There were serious budget cuts for the social sectors during the 1990s, resulting in \ndeteriorating  quality  of  social  services  and  stagnating  enrollment  rates.  According  to  the \nprojections given in the P-PRSP, PG has committed to substantially enhancing social sector \nallocations  in  the  coming  3  years,  with  an  average  increase  of  16%  for  health,  12%  for \neducation, and 67% for WSS.21 These additional commitments are subject to the improved \nperformance of the economy as a whole.  \n \n106.  Pakistan has strengthened its economic performance considerably over the last 3 years. \nThe Government has put in place a consistent economic management strategy that is based on \nfiscal stabilization and debt reduction to mitigate macroeconomic vulnerabilities. In FY2003/04, \nthe economy recorded a GDP growth rate of 6.4% as against 5.1% in 2002/03, the fiscal deficit \nhas come down to 3.3% of GDP compared with an average of 7.0% in the 1990s, and the \npoverty rate has decreased by 4.2%.22 With ongoing reforms and some improvement in the \ninvestment rate, economic growth may improve further. However, the country\u2019s political and \neconomic stability is dependent on geopolitical developments in the region, especially peaceful \nrelations with neighbors such as India and Afghanistan. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n107.  In addition to the standard assurances, PG has given the following specific assurances, \nwhich have been incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  PG will ensure (a) that the objectives achieved, policies adopted, and actions \ntaken prior to the date of the Loan Agreements, as set forth in the development \n                                                        \n21 The increases for social sector budgets in FY2004 were substantial: 41% in health, 27% in education, and 124% in \nWSS.  \n22 Budget speech of the Finance Minister to the National Assembly, 12 June 2004. \n   ", "  25\npolicy letter, will continue to be in full force and effect for the duration of the \nprogram  period  and  subsequently;  and  (b)  proper  and  timely  achievement, \nadoption, compliance and implementation of the objectives, policies, and actions \nto be achieved, adopted, complied with, and implemented as set forth in the draft \ndevelopment policy letter will ensure that once achieved, adopted, complied with, \nand implemented, such objectives, policies, and actions will continue to be in full \nforce and effect during and subsequent to the program period.  \n \n(ii)  PG will demonstrate its commitment to the fiscal decentralization process by \nensuring that all fees pertaining to the social sector are retained by such sector \nand utilized for better management of services. \n \n(iii)  PG commits to increase (a) the social sector allocations in line with P-PRSP and \nMTBF targets and (b) the social sector expenditures as a percentage of total \nallocations every year of the program period at the provincial, DG, and TMA \nlevels: (i) 80% in 2005/06, (ii) 85% in 2006/07, and (iii) 90% in 2007/08. PG will \nalso maintain the provincial allocable funds as a percentage of divisible pool, at \nleast, at the 2003/04 level. \n \n(iv)  PG commits to create greater fiscal space for the DGs and the program TMAs \nand will ensure that their capability for financial management is enhanced by \nimproving accounting, auditing, and reporting mechanisms.  \n \n(v)  PG will ensure that the loan proceeds will be disbursed by its Department of \nFinance to the eligible DGs and program TMAs within 1 month from the date of \nreceipt thereof. \n \n(vi)  PG will require the DGs and the program TMAs to ensure timely flow of funds to \nparticipating CBOs, CCBs, and services. \n \n(vii)  PG  will  require  the  DGs,  program  TMAs,  CBOs,  and  CCBs  to  adopt  and \nimplement clear procedures for the release and use of the loan proceeds. \n \n(viii)  PG will require: (a) each DG to deposit the loan proceeds in a civil account; and \n(b) each program TMA to deposit the loan proceeds in a local fund account, for \nefficient tracking of the loan proceeds and have their respective accounts and \nrelated financial statements audited annually by the District Audit Office of the \nPakistan Auditor General; \n \n(ix)  PG will undertake purposive actions to achieve role clarity regarding the PLDs, \nDGs, and TMAs in relation to the social sector, with clear distinctions between \nthe roles, responsibilities, and accountability at each level. \n \n(x)  PG will require the DGs and the program TMAs to rationalize nonfunctional \nschools, basic health units, and water schemes according to their potential for \nservice delivery. \n \n(xi)  PG  will  establish  a  framework  to  selectively  support  training  institutions  for \ncapacity building and technical support of the DGs and the program TMAs. \n \n     \n ", "26  \n(xii)  PG  confirms  that  the  Program  will  not  entail  any  land  acquisition  and/or \nresettlement. In the event of unforeseen land acquisition and/or resettlement, PG \nwill ensure that: (a) all land required for the purposes of the Program will be \nPunjab\u2019s land free from any encumbrances, structures, human settlements, or \ncultivation; (b) no person will be adversely affected in terms of ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement; and (c) PG will prepare, in consultation with ADB, the \nrequisite resettlement plan(s) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement. In such an eventuality, any award of civil works contracts will be \nconditional upon ADB\u2019s approval of such resettlement plan(s). \n \n(xiii)  PG will ensure that the Program and the TA will be carried out in accordance with \nthe  environmental  rules  and  regulations  applicable  in  Pakistan  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy. PG will ensure that adequate environmental protection and \nsafety measures will be included in the design of the program facilities and that \nthe  program  facilities  will  be  constructed,  operated,  and  maintained  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. PG will ensure implementation of \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  mitigation  measures,  and  the  environmental \nmanagement plan set out in Supplementary Appendix I, including development \nand  implementation  of  (a)  service  standards  and  operating  procedures  for \ndisposal of hazardous and medical waste, and (b) provincial policies for WSS \nand solid waste management. \n \n(xiv)  PG will, in a timely manner, promote and implement the Punjab GRAP. PG will \nensure that in accordance with the gender strategy set out in Appendix 12, a \ngender  action  plan  will  be  prepared,  which  will  entail  gender-sensitive \ninterventions  in  areas  such  as  capacity  building  of  service  providers,  health \nservices for women and children, strengthening the role of women councilors, \nschool facilities for girls, and adequate representation of women in the PSC and \nthe PSU. \n \n(xv)  PG will allocate and make available to the PSU, in a timely manner, requisite \ncounterpart  funds  from  its  budget  for  each  fiscal  year  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation of the TA. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n(i)  Planning Commission Performa-1 for the TA component will be approved by the \nExecutive Committee for National Economic Council. \n \n(ii)  Copies of the agreed final drafts of the MOUs for conditional grants are available \nafter consultation with PLDs, PFC, LGC, and DGs and program TMAs. \n \n(iii)  DFID will have confirmed the grant from the Government of the United Kingdom, \nand will have entered into arrangements with ADB, for administration by ADB, of \nthe grant.  \n \n \n  \n \n   ", "  27\nVIII.

The literacy rate is very low in Punjab like in other parts of Pakistan. \nThe literacy rate of the population 10 years and above is around 47% (57% for males and 36% \nfor females), with a much lower literacy of 38% (26% for females) in rural areas. The enrollment \nrates over the past few years have more or less stagnated, with gross enrollment rates (GERs) \nat primary, middle, and secondary levels at 53%, 45%, and 42%, respectively.

These  institutions  are  managed  by \n500,000  staff  including  319,905  teachers. \nDuring 2002, around 5 million boys and girls  Table A2.2: Enrollment by Gender \nwere enrolled at primary level, 1.64 million at \nStudents \nmiddle  level,  and  0.73 million  at  secondary  No. of  Teaching \nLevel of Education  Gender Enrolled\nSchools  Staff \nlevel.

Over 55,000 posts of teachers in the public sector at various levels are vacant, although \nthe Government of Punjab (PG) is now making serious efforts to fill these positions.

Private Sector. According to Educational Management Information System (EMIS) data \nfor 2003, the private sector is operating 18,387 schools (6,785 for boys, 4,065 for girls, and \n7,537 coeducation) and enrolled 31% students from primary to higher secondary level in the \nage-group of 5 to 16 years. Efforts are under way to engage the private sector through the \nstrengthened Education Foundation. In urban and semi-urban areas where private schooling is \n ", "Appendix 2  33\nsignificant, it is important to consider using the private system to expand coverage of school \neducation and enhance quality. \n \n5.  Handicapped Children. Handicapped persons numbering about 1.8 million form about \n2.5% of the country\u2019s population. About one third falls in the school age-group of 5\u201319 years. In \nPunjab, of the estimated 600,000 special needs children, only about 4,000 are enrolled in \nspecial needs schools. Currently, there are 120 schools \nTableA2.3: Schools for Handicapped \nfor  all  four  disabilities  (Table  A2.3).

Policy. The National Education Policy 1998\u20132010 envisages achievement of universal \nprimary education by 2010 and a gross primary enrollment rate of 105%. This objective is \ndirectly  linked  with  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy  Paper  (PRSP)  and  Millenium  Table A2.4: Education Sector Reforms Targets \nDevelopment  Goal  (MDG)  2.

Quality of Education. The quality of education at all levels is unacceptably low. The \nprescribed teacher-student ratio of 1:40 at primary level is not conducive for learning, while \nthere are no standards beyond the primary level. The high dropout rate is a proxy indicator of \naccess to schools and low quality of education. Lack of basic facilities in schools, high teacher \nabsenteeism, and inadequate monitoring are other contributory factors. The Department of \nEducation controls interdistrict transfers of teachers with consequent loose control of local \ngovernments (LGs) over their staff. Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) has \nbegun to address some of these problems but much greater efforts are required to address \nquality of education, teacher development and motivation, monitoring learning achievement, and \nidentifying alternatives of hiring qualified teachers. \n \n ", "34  Appendix 2     \n8.  Financing. PG allocated PRs33,046 million to the education sector during 2002/03. The \nallocation of PRs42,023 million for 2003/04 shows a substantial increase of 27% over 2002/03. \nThe additional allocations during 2003/04 are largely the result of resources flowing under ESR. \nThe policy instruments under ESR attempt to (i) reduce teacher absenteeism, strengthen school \ncouncils, improve monitoring and evaluation, encourage public-private partnerships through \nrestructuring of the Education Foundation, and improve the quality of education; and (ii) improve \naccess to education by free education up to secondary level, girl scholarships for grades 6 to 8, \nschool consolidation, provision of missing infrastructure, and free text books. The PESRP credit \nof $100 million each for 3 successive years represents a huge injection of resources, providing \na major boost to the education sector and engaging the LGs in implementation.  \n \n9.  Currently,  secondary  education  is  receiving  very  limited  financial  support.  This  is \nparticularly true for girls\u2019 education, especially in the 15 most deprived districts. Without a major \nboost to girls\u2019 enrollment in secondary education, it will not be possible to achieve the MDGs on \ngender  parity.  It  will  also  not  be  possible  to  produce  enough  female  teachers  and  health \nworkers.  The  primary  candidates  for  investment  under  PDSSP  include  consolidation  of \nsecondary schools, upgrading of girl\u2019s middle schools, developing safety nets to attract girls\u2019 \nenrollment in secondary schools through scholarships and/or free textbooks, and selective \nexpansion of education facilities and options for providing education to handicapped children. \nCareful analysis is necessary to evolve a strategy to mainstream special needs education to \nenroll students to meet the Education for All target and selectively address the needs of those \nchildren with more severe disabilities. Initially, it is important to do further analysis to identify \nareas that would complement PESRP in order to avoid duplication and to evolve the innovations \nthat are essential in education. \n \nB.  Health, Nutrition, and Population Sector \n \n10.  Current Status. The poor health status in Pakistan in general and Punjab province in \nspecific is characterized by rural-urban, income, and gender-based differentials. The male to \nfemale sex ratio is 107 in urban and 105 in rural areas . The infant mortality rates are 88 per \n1,000 live births in rural areas compared to 65 in urban areas. In urban areas, the gender \ndifferentials in infant mortality are significant: the female infant mortality rate is 70 deaths per \n1,000 live births compared to 60 deaths per 1,000 live births in male children. The infant \nmortality rates are higher in children of illiterate women: 89 deaths per 1,000 live births in \nilliterate  women  compared  to  49  in  children  of  mothers  who  had  more  than  10  years  of \nschooling. The overall levels of complete childhood immunization is 53% in Pakistan, while \nPunjab  province  has  done  better  at  57%;  Balochistan  is  only  24%.  The  income-based \ndifferentials in childhood immunization are significant. In Punjab province, the coverage rates \nare 50% less in the poorest quintile than the richest quintile.  \n \n11.  Malnutrition is a major contributor to infant and maternal deaths. Almost 40% of the \nburden of disease is related to communicable diseases, 12% to reproductive health problems, \nand 6% to nutritional deficiencies. Punjab province appears to be in an early stage of the \nepidemiological transition, where preventable or readily treatable diseases primarily affecting \nyoung children and women account for a dominant share of morbidity and premature mortality. \n \n12.  Health Service Utilization. Utilization of public sector health services is low. At basic \nhealth units (BHUs), the average daily attendance is 22 patients including, weekly, two clients \nfor family planning services and three antenatal checkups. At rural health centers, there are \nthree family planning clients and seven antenatal checkups per week in daily attendance on 69 \npatients. In tehsil (town) headquarters hospitals, the outpatient services are well attended, but \n ", "Appendix 2  35\nutilization of beds and reproductive health services generally remains low. The low utilization of \nservices is because of inappropriate staff and skills mix, short working hours, absenteeism, and \nmany vacant posts in less affluent areas. \n \n13.  While 82% of children suffering from diarrhea are taken for consultation in Pakistan, in \nPunjab  province  it  is  86%.  However,  only  44%  of  children  with  diarrhea  are  given  oral \nrehydration therapy in Punjab province compared to 54% in Pakistan as a whole. In urban \nareas, only 18% of children were seen in government hospitals/dispensaries, while in rural \nareas it was 21%. Proximity to private health providers and lack of a government facility in the \nvillage and staff helpfulness were two of the main reasons for children with diarrhea seeking \nprivate providers.  \n \n14.  Only 40% of women in Punjab visit health facility for prenatal consultation compared to \n35% in Pakistan. Of them, 42% visited a government hospital or clinic. Only 31% of women in \nrural areas have prenatal consultations compared to 64% in urban areas of Punjab. Only 43% of \npregnant women receive one tetanus injection, compared to 38% in Pakistan. Here again, the \npercentage of rural women who get one shot of tetanus injection is 37% compared to 63% in \nurban areas. Only 20% of pregnant women deliver in institutions, of which 12% in private \nfacilities and 8% in government facilities. In rural areas, the percentage of institutional delivery is \nonly 13% compared to 44% in urban areas. The Pakistan Integrated Household Survey, 2001 \nfound that 21% of facilities do not have female staff, 64% of facilities charge a general fee, \nwhich  is  on  average  PRs61,  72%  of  facilities  have  electricity,  75%  have  oral  rehydration \ntherapy, 46% have contraceptives, 60% have vaccines, and 84% have anti-malarial drugs. \n \n15.  Health Expenditures. Households spend 4.8% of their total consumption expenditure \non health,23 which ranges from 4.1% in the lowest income quintile to 5.6% in the 5th income \nquintile. The relative expenditures on health as a share of GDP in Pakistan and surrounding \ncountries are given in the table below. The overall health expenditures as a share  of GDP in \nPakistan is slightly less than the overall average of South Asia. The public expenditure on health \nas a percentage share of overall expenditures on health is on the higher side of the region, and \nhigher than India. However, there is still scope for increases in public expenditures on health \ncompared to most of the countries in the region. As presented in Table A2.5, the per capita \nexpenditure on health in Pakistan is less than the South Asian average, which also indicates \ngreater need for investments in the health sector.  \n \n16.  Policy. The National Health Policy, 2001 classifies health sector investments as part of \npoverty reduction. The main thrust of the health policy is to reduce widespread prevalence of \ncommunicable  diseases,  address  inequalities  in  primary/secondary  health  care  services, \nimprove management and professional skills of the district health systems, promote greater \ngender equality, bridge nutrition gaps in the target populations, reduce urban-rural imbalances \nin the health sector, introduce a framework for regulation of the private health sector, create \nmass awareness in public health matters, improve regulation of the drug sector, and build \ncapacity  for  monitoring  health  policy.  The  Population  Policy  pf  Pakistan  (2002)  states  of \nPakistan states universal access to safe family planning methods by 2010, and a population \ngrowth rate of 1.3% and fertility to replacement level of 2.1 births by 2020. The Punjab Poverty \nReduction Strategy reinforces the need to achieve the objectives of the National Health Policy \nand the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n \n                                                        \n23 Federal Bureau of Statistics, Statistics Division. 2002.

World Development Report. 2003. Washington, D.C.: World Bank. \n \n17.  Human  Resources.  The  provincial  and  district  departments  of  health  have  around \n130,692 jobs for various categories of health staff, of which approximately 20% of posts are not \nfilled. The category-wise sanctioned jobs include 2,238 specialists (of which 1,135 jobs are in \nthe hospitals under LGs), 9,609 general duty doctors (about 49% of them serve in LGs), 441 \ndental surgeons, 6,136 nurses (around 19% with LGs), 36,243 lady health workers serving in \nLGs, and 69,208 paramedics and support staff. Female doctors constitute  around 22% of \nsanctioned posts of general duty doctors. The nurse-doctor ratio in the public sector is 1:2, a \npattern reflecting inappropriate staff mix and skills mix. The vacancy rates are much higher in \nhard-to-reach, unattractive areas, especially for female health workers, because of the uniform \npay package, even under contract appointment. About 50% of contract doctors and 15\u201320% of \nparamedics leave the job because of unattractive wages. \n \n18.  Infrastructure and Facilities. The public sector health system runs on four tiers of \nservices. Lady health workers provide community-based services for mother and child health, \nfamily planning, immunization, and malaria. The primary care facilities include 2,489 BHUs and \n301 rural health centers (RHCs). A BHU, staffed by four professionals, provides preventive and \nlimited curative care. An RHC, a higher-level primary care facility with 20 beds, is staffed by \nabout eight professionals including four medics. The 77 tehsil headquarters hospitals with 40\u2013\n60  beds  and  staffed  by  3\u20135  specialists  provide  inpatient  and  outpatient  care.  District \nheadquarters hospitals, with 80\u2013250 beds each, offer second-line referral care. The 17 teaching \nhospitals, located in major cities, provide specialized care and are attached to medical colleges \nfor undergraduate and postgraduate training.  \n \n19.  Public-Private Partnership. In the absence of a comprehensive policy for public-private \npartnerships,  the  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  has  been  implementing  three  partnership \nmodels. Medical colleges and their attached hospitals have been given autonomous status \nthrough legal cover and rules of business. The concept of autonomy has yet to be extended to \ndistrict hospitals. The other examples include: (i) transfer of management of BHUs in Rahimyar \nKhan  District  to  a  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  and  (ii) establishment  of  the  Health \nFoundation. The NGO partnership is in early stages of implementation. The Health Foundation, \nin the last 10 years, has failed to activate its financing window for NGOs to expand pro-poor \nhealth services.  \n \n ", "Appendix 2  37\n20.  Devolution. Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 2001 has devolved the following four \nfunctions of the health sector to the district governments: basic and rural health, child and \nwomen health, hospitals up to district level, and population welfare. The latter, however a \nvertical program, continues to be federally funded and provincially managed. However, there is \na  functional  relationship  with  the  executive  district  officer  of  health  for  provision  of  family \nplanning services. The federal Ministry of Health also supports preventive programs through tied \ngrants, and the system is well streamlined. The management staff of health sectors at the \ndistrict level is generally well trained in public health and management.  \n \n21.  The main challenges in advancing devolution are related to: control by the provincial \ngovernment on staff appointments and posting and transfers; the use of delegation of the \nfinancial powers rules of 1990; services and staff are not in line with the burden of disease; and \npoor internal monitoring controls by and committees set under the PLGO. A few public-private \npartnership initiatives are under implementation, which need to be evaluated and  systematically \nexpanded,  based  on  the  evaluation  outcomes.  The  district-wise  multiple  indicator  cluster \nsurveys are likely to be available by the end of 2004.  The surveys result would guide the \ndistricts for effecting improvements in planning and management of the health sector. Further, a \nformal or informal system for regulation of the private health sector is lacking.  \n \n22.  Financing. According to PRMP conditionality, PG was to provide an additional budget of \n20% for the health sector in 2003/04 over 2002/03. While the provincial budget shows an \nincrease of 68% from PRs4.2 billion in 2002/03 to PRs7 billion in 2003/04, the district health \nbudgets for 19 districts revealed a meager increase of 5.6%. LGs\u2019 budget for medicines shows \nmuch interdistrict variation, ranging from 7.9% of the total budget in Sheikhupura to 32.9% in \nJhang district. The district governments implement preventive programs and fund recurring \ncosts, including staff salaries, while the federal Government provides an annual tied grant of \naround PRs1.45 billion outside Account IV. \n \n23.  Program Investment. There are major programmatic and financing gaps in the public \nhealth sector. These include the absence of reproductive health services at community level \nthrough  trained  midwives,  except  for  a  small-scale  investment  built  into  the  ADB  funded \nWomen\u2019s Health Project;24 transforming the current service package into an essential pro-poor \npackage of services; improving the staff mix and skills mix backed by skills development; \nexpanding public-private partnerships; and improving internal and external monitoring systems. \nThe RHCs and tehsil hospitals should provide 24-hour emergency services to improve the \nsurvival rates of the unborn and the mother during pregnancy. To ensure high-quality and \nreliable services, all the vacant positions (paras. 3, 12, 17) need to be filled quickly. Here, it may \nbe desirable to try facility-specific contractual appointment of the health staff, with incentives \nbuilt in for remote areas. In remote areas, innovative models such as the contracting out of \nprimary health care services to reputed NGOs may be necessary. To ensure participation and \ncontribution of the local communities in running the health facilities, it may be essential to \nconstitute health facility committees, and give them authority to raise user fees and use the \nrevenues from them for improving the quality of health services. All these improvements would \nalso require consolidation and upgrading of the existing health infrastructure. \n \n \n \n \n                                                        \n24 ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Women\u2019s Health Project. Manila. \n ", "38  Appendix 2     \nC.  Water Supply and Sanitation Sector  \n \n24.  Current Status. The major source of drinking water in Punjab is groundwater. However \nin 26 districts, there are significant pockets of water scarcity or brackish subsoil water where \nabout 10,000 villages are located. In eight districts and some pockets in other districts, subsoil \nwater is of good quality and easily accessible. About 94% of households have a water source \ninside the house, of which 76% get water from a handmotor pump and 18% from the public \nwater supply system. The remaining 6% use unsafe water from shallow wells, rivers, or canals \nthat are often located at a considerable distance, with the burden of fetching water largely falling \non women. Treatment of public water supplies is undertaken at only a few places and even that \nis on a limited scale; there is no treatment of water at the household level either, except in a few \nurban households. The infrastructure for water supply and sanitation (WSS) was developed in \nthe past without analyzing the feasibility and affordability of operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts.  As  a  result,  several  hundred  poorly  designed,  and  financially  and  institutionally \nunsustainable rural water supply schemes have been abandoned. The experience shows that \nrural communities can only maintain low-cost water supply schemes using simple technology, \nand when these schemes are planned and developed with their participation.  \n \n25.  Around 68% of rural and 7% of urban households have no toilet facility. The lack of \naccess by the poor to a flush latrine is a major public health concern as it contributes to the \nspread of waterborne and food-borne diseases. Over 42% of households are not connected to a \ndrainage system, and nearly the same percentage of households are connected to an open \ndrain.  The  underground  or  covered  drainage  system  is  only  available  to  38%  of  urban \nhouseholds. The position of garbage disposal is even worse. Only 6% of all households have \naccess to a municipal garbage collection system, representing 19% of urban households. About \n12% of households have established a \u201cprivate\u201d system for garbage collection. \n \n26.  Key Issues. Prior to devolution, the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) in \nrural areas and towns, and the water and sanitation agencies (WASAs) in cities with 5 million-\nplus  populations  were  the  main  agencies  responsible  for  planning  and  implementing  all \nprovincial  government-financed  major  investment  projects.  In  addition,  the  municipalities \nimplemented  minor  investments  largely  from  their  own  resources.  Under  the  PLGO,  all \nmunicipal functions, including WSS, were assigned to the TMA, along with staff devolved from \nthe Local Government and Rural Development (LG&RD) Department, Health and Population \nPolicy Department, and PHED. While PHED transferred its field staff to the TMAs, it has \ncontinued its links with the sector through retaining staff in four regional units and at the \nprovincial level, and through assigning to itself powers of approval of WSS projects costing \nmore than PRs5 million. The PHED is also implementing an ADB-financed WSS project through \nwhich it is exercising responsibilities devolved to the TMAs under the PLGO.  \n \n27.  The WSS system faces three major challenges. The first concerns institutional and \norganizational aspects ranging from those inherited by TMAs from their predecessors\u2014weak \nsystem  of  operating  practices,  both  technical  and  operational\u2014to  those  arising  from \nresponsibilities assigned for the first-time, exclusive mandate for integrated planning and service \ndelivery in both rural and urban areas within their jurisdiction. This means that participatory \nplanning systems have to be developed; systems and procedures for O&M and procurement \nmodernized;  billing,  recovery,  cost  control,  and  monitoring  strengthened;  and  transparent, \ncustomer-responsive management introduced.  \n \n28.  The second challenge relates to the unfinished agenda for devolution. The main issues \npertain  to  (i) granting  administrative  powers  for  approval  and  technical  sanction  above \n ", "Appendix 2  39\nPRs5 million;  (ii) creating  a  municipal  service  structure;  (iii) instituting  a  conditional  and \nperformance  grants  system  to  promote  provincial  policy  objectives  and  reward  TMA \nmanagement performance; (iv) delineating clear lines of control between province and TMA and \nrelations among LGs; (v) strengthening policy direction at the provincial level (rather than control \nof implementation and decision making); and (vi) effectively offsetting the threat of reassumption \nof powers by agencies from which they were devolved to the TMA (particularly PHED). \n \n29.  The third challenge relates to strategic direction: (i) lack of adequate focus on sanitation \n(hygiene awareness, excreta disposal, wastewater disposal including its treatment, solid waste \ncollection and sanitary disposal); (ii) need for greater attention to monitoring the quality of \ndrinking water, e.g., hand-pumps and municipal systems, and remedial measures for their \nprotection;  (iii) requirement  for  improved  and  sustainable  O&M  of  existing  and  new  WSS \ninvestments; and (iv) the overarching need for increasing access to WSS coverage for a large, \nunserviced segment of society. \n  \n30.  Financing. TMAs in Punjab receive about PRs8 billion in federal and provincial transfers \nbesides their own revenue sources. In the period 2004\u20132009, this is being supplemented by \ninvestments in the WSS sector by (i) the WASAs in the 5 million-plus cities; (ii) small-scale \nschemes by union administrations funded by the district governments (currently estimated at \nabout PRs50 million annually), and others implemented with LG funds under public-private \npartnership  arrangements  through  community  citizen  boards  (CCBs);  (iii) grants  from  the \nprovincial government; and (iv) two ADB-assisted projects ($60 million in the Punjab Community \nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Project and $86 million in the Southern Punjab Basic Urban \nServices Project, excluding implementation-related costs). \n \n31.  Program Policy and Plans. PG is following a uniform policy framework in rural WSS \nschemes to promote community ownership through community-based organizations and water \nuser committees and management of operations and maintenance costs. PG intends to transfer \nall functions related to WSS to TMAs in accordance with the PLGO, except in city districts \nwhere  these  functions  are  with  the  city  district  government.  The  provincial  government\u2019s \nfunctions will be clearly delineated in terms of policy design, technical capacity building of \nTMAs, and overall monitoring. Enhancing capacity building of TMAs is planned through various \ninitiatives, including the ADB-assisted programs, Decentralization Support Program, and two \nWSS projects. PG is also considering the viability of completing those schemes that were \nincomplete and abandoned by PHED after devolution, and handing them over to communities \nafter completion. \n \n ", "40  Appendix 2     \nTable A2.6: Key Social Sector Indicators and Targets, Punjab Province \n1995\u2013 2001\u2013 2007\u2013 2014\u2013\nIndicator  Source \n1996  2002  2008  2015  \nHealth Sector \nInfant mortality rate per 1,000 live births  PIHS  101.00  82.00  65.00  40.00 \nChild mortality rate per 1,000 live births  PRHFPS  111.00  103.00  75.00  50.00 \nChildren <5 year under weight for age (%)  NHSP  40.00  38.00  30.00  25.00 \nChildren fully immunized, 12\u201323 months (%)  PIHS  47.00  57.00  80.00  85.00 \nMaternal mortality ratio per 1,000 live births  Estimates  350.00  300.00  250.00  150.00 \nTotal fertility rate  PRHFPS  4.66  4.20  4.00  3.60 \nDelivery by trained birth attendant (%)  PIHS  12.00  24.00  40.00  60.00 \nContraceptive prevalence rate (%)  PRHFPS  23.90  27.60  50.00  60.00 \nEducation Sector \nLiteracy rate 10 years and above (%)  PIHS  37.00  40.00  60.00  80.00 \nPopulation 10 years and above who have  PIHS  54.00  59.00  70.00  80.00 \ncompleted primary education or higher(%) \nGross enrollment rate at primary level (%)\u2014 PIHS  85.00  84.00  100.00  105.00 \nmale \nGross enrollment rate at primary level (%)\u2014 PIHS  70.00  69.00  95.00  105.00 \nfemale \nNet enrollment rate at primary level (%)\u2014 PIHS  50.00  47.00  70.00  90.00 \nmale \nNet enrollment rate at primary level (%)\u2014 PIHS  39.00  43.00  70.00  90.00 \nfemale \nGross enrollment rate at middle level (%)\u2014 PIHS  52.00  46.00  70.00  80.00 \nmale \nGross enrollment rate at middle level (%)\u2014 PIHS  31.00  43.00  65.00  80.00 \nfemale \nGross enrollment rate at secondary level  PIHS  50.00  55.00  60.00  75.00 \n(%)\u2014male \nGross enrollment rate at secondary level  PIHS  28.00  34.00  40.00  70.00 \n(%)\u2014female \nWater Supply and Sanitation            \nAccess to piped water (% rural)  PIHS  9.00  6.00  15.00  25.00 \nAccess to hand/motor pump (% rural)  PIHS  84.00  88.00  80.00  70.00 \nAccess to flush toilet (% rural)  PIHS  20.00  31.00  45.00  60.00 \nNHPS = National Health and Population Study, PIHS = Pakistan Integrated Household Survey, PRHPS = Pakistan \nReproductive Health and Family Planning Survey. \nNote: Figures for 2007/08 and 2014/15 are projections by the design team. \nSources: Pakistan Integrated Household Survey 2001/02; National Nutrition Survey of Pakistan 2001/02; National \nHealth Survey of Pakistan 1990\u20131994; Pakistan Reproductive Health and Family Planning Survey 2000/01. \n ", "     \n \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \nPDSSPa  PRMP\u2014Subprogram Ib   DSPc   PESRPd  Other Projects/Programs \n1.

With  the\nrescheduling  of  external  debt  and  a more  proaclive  debt  management  strategy  in  place,\nrecord  levels  of  exports,  lowering  of  interest  rates,  a buoyant  stock  market  and a continued\npolicy  of  privatization,  the  GDP  growth  has shown  a persistent  upward  trend,  estimated  at\nabout  6.4%  in FY2004,  and projected  to rise at 6.6%  during  FY200S.  The  experience  in the\npast  shows  tllat  tile  benefits  of  economic  growth  do  not  reach  the  poor  unless  targeted\ninterventions  specially  relating  to delivery  of essential  social  services  are not  implementecJ.\n2.  At  the core of  the governance refonn  agenda is the devolution  programme,\nwhich  has  created  a  new  structure  and  opportunities  to  increase  local  ownership,\nparticipation,  responsiveness to local needs. and accountability  to the public.  These refonns\nare expected  to  enhance  the  efficiency,  equity,  effectiveness  and sllstainability  of  social\nservices delivery.\n3.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  has also  prepared  a Poverty  Reduclion  Strategy\nI>aper (PRSP)  wilh  the Province  of  Punjab  having  developed  a similar  province  level  PRSP,\nwhich  sets out  a comprehensive  policy  refonn  agenda  to break  lhe vicious  cycle  of  poverty.\nPrepared  afler  exlensive  consullations  with  all  stakeholders,  lhe  PRSP  revolves  around  four\nbasic  slralegies:  (i)  achieving  high  olld  broad-based  economic  growth,  (ii)  improving\ngovernance  and  consolidating  devolulion.  (iii)  developing  human  capital  and  efficient\ndelivery  of  social  services,  and  (iv)  reducing  inequalilies  and  bringing  lhe  poor,  vulnerable\nand lhe backward  regions  in the mainslream  of development.\n4.  The  Government  of  Punjab  is  fully  committed  to  the  refonns  programme\ninitiated  by  the  Federal  government.  The  broad  based  governance  and  devolution  support\nprograntmes  of  the  Goventment  of  the  Punjub  include  tho  I>unjab  Resource  Mw1agCJnenl\nProgramme,  Punjab-Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  Devolulion  St'pport  Programme  and\nPunjab  Educalion  Reforms  Programme.  These  programmes  aim  at  better  marlsgement  of\nfinances  in  the  province  and  strengthening  of  institutional  and  systems  capacily  for\nimproved  services  delivery.  As  delivery  of socia!  services  is the basic  Cunction  of  the Local\nGovenlment  instilutions,  these  programmes  will  ultimately  improve  delivery  of  social\nservices in the provi\"-ce.  .\n5.  The  social  development  indicators  of  the  Plmjab  province  are  reflective  of\noverall  situation  of  the country.  These  indicators  have  lagged  behind  neighboring  and many\nother  low-income  countries  in  terms  of  health,  fertility  and  social  sector  outcomes.  Child\nmortality  is very  high  -  nearly  II % of the children  do not  see their  fiftll  birthday  because  of\nlimited  access  to  adequate  childhood  healthcare  services.  Women  face  burden  of\nchil,tbearing  in  addition  to gender  discrimination.  Every  year,  about  200,000  women  suffer\ncomplications  of  pregnancy,  only  about  15% are able  to reach  a hospital,  and nearly  10,000\ndie  becallse  of  lack  of  access  to  obstetric  emergency  care.  Althollgh  the  mean  age  at\nmarriage  (22.55)  and  contraceptive  prevalence  rate  (30%)  have  increased  overtime,  the\naverage  household  size  is  still  6.54  persons.  while  literacy  rates  in  Punjab  have  shown\ngradual  increase  over  the  years,  enrolments  in primary  and  middle  edllcation  have  generally\ndccfined  or  at  boat  stagnated  from  1996  10 2001.The  availability  of  piped  water  in  rural\nhouseholds  is  nearly  ono-thir,1  among  the lowest  income  qllintile  than  among  the  highest.\nI  .\nThe  position  with  regard  to sanitation  racilitics  warrants  special  efTorts  by tIle  government.", "Appendix5   49\nLetter of DevelopmenPt oky-ADB\n6.  The poor social indicators  in Punjab are due to a variety  of reasons. The most\nimportant  challenges  in  the past constraining  the quality  of,  and access to social  services\nhave been the result  of  frequent  recruitment  bans, insufficient  funding,  lack of  allocative\nefficiency,  poor  utilization  and sometimes  misuse  of  allocated  funds,  delayed  release of\nfunds  for operations  and maintenance,  high  turnover  of personnel  in  leadership positions,\npoor  governance  practices  and  limited  stakeholders  involvement  in  the  design  and\nmanagement of service delivery,  and weak public  accountability  at all levels.\n7.  Realizing  the  need  for  human  capital  development  to  accelerate  economic\ngrowth  and  reduce  poverty,  the  Government  of  the  Punjab  in  the  recent  years  has  been\ngiving  high  priority  to  improving  the  quality  of  and  access to  social  services.  To  meet  the\nchallenge,  it  has  realigned  expenditures  both  at  the  provincial  and  the  district  levels  in\nfavour  of  social  services,  particularly  for  education,  health,  and water  and sanitation  sectors.\nThe  authority  to manage  general  health  and  education  services  has been  devolved  to district\ngovernments,  while  water  and  sanitation  to  the  Tehsil  Municipal  Administration  (TMAs).\nThe  local  governments'  institutional  system  ttlough  nascent  has shown  some  improvements\nin  the  last  three  years  in  terms  of  better  staff  attendance,  improved  availability  of  supplies\nand  drugs,  and  considerable  expansion  of  municipal  services.  Although  local  governments\nprovide  great  opportunities  in  the coming  years  for  improving  governance  and effectiveness\nof public  services,  the system  needs continued  support  to achieve  the stated  objectives.\n8.  The  social  sector  priorities  set  by  the  Government  of  the  Punjab  are  an\nintegral  part  of  its  poverty  alleviation  strategy  reflected  in  the  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy\nPapers.  and the overall  refonns  agenda  of  the Punjab  Resource  Management  Programme  and\nDevolution  Support  Programme.  The  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  aims  to achieve  progress\non  the  targets  set  under  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  and  in  order  to  improve  the\nsocial  indicators  through  governance  reforms,  qualitative  and  quantitative  improvements  in\ndelivery  of social  sector  services,  improved  fiscal  and financial  management,  and promotion\nof private  sector  development  including  fostering  community  involvement  in the delivery  of\nsocial  services.\n9.  The  Government  of  Pul1jab has already  initiated  Education  Sector  Reform\nProgramme  since  the  beginning  of  2004.  It  is  targeted  at  increasing  enrolment  rates\nespecially  for  girls  and improving  the quality  of  education.  The main  refonns  include:  (i)\npublic  finance refom1s to increase the level  attd share of education  expenditures and reduce\nuncertainty  in  resource  allocation;  (ii)  devolution  and public  sector  refonns  comprising\nsupport  for devolution  and strengthening  governance  and fiduciary  environments;  and (iii)\neducation  sector refom\\s  comprising  strengthening  teachers management,  revitalization  of\nschool  councils,  strengthening  monitoring  and evaluation,  improving  education quality  and\naccess, and strengthen  public-private  partnerships.  Education  has been made free up  to\ngrade 10 including  free text books up to class VIII  and stipends for girls  in grade VII  - VIII.\nFurthermore,  accountability  mechanisms  have been strengthened  by  the introduction  of  a\nfacility-based  recruitment  of  teachers. As  a result  of  these interventions,  there have been\nimprovements  in  retention  and enrolment  rates. The Government  of  the Punjab is in  the\nprocess of extending  monitoring  capacity  developed  under PESRP  to other sub-sectors of\nthe social sector.\n10.  The  Gqyemment  of  Punjab  is currently  assessing the quality  and utility  of\nhealth  infrastructure  through  a mapping  exercise.  The  health  sector  budgets  have  been\nsubstantially  increased  in last  three years raising  allocations  from  Rs9.796 billion  in  FY\n2002 to Rs 17.805 in  FY2004.  The district  governments  have been allocated about 40% of\nthe  provincial  health  budget  to  finance  salary  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)\nexpenditures  of  health  fa,c~lities ranging  from  basic  Jtealth  units  to  district  hospitals.\nHowever,  health sector  still  remains  under-funded  and understaffed  for providing  essential\npackage heallh  services.  These are the major  factors  constraining  delivery  of  basic health\nservices.\n11.  The  Government  of  Punjab  under  P-PRSP, 2003  envisages implementing  a\npolicy  framework  in line with  National  Health  Policy  2001 and National  Population  Policy\n2002.  The P-PRSP pledges to achieve targets set under MOOs  to reduce infant  and child\nmorta1ities,  improve  i~munization  of  children,  increase proportion  of  births  attended  by\nhealth professionals,  improve  contraceptive  prevalence rate and reduce total fertility.  The p-.\nPRSP,  2003  has  highlighted  the  following  strategies  for  accelerating  health  status:  (i)", "50  Appendix 5\nLetter of Devek>pmertP  olicy-ADS\nstrengthening  PHC services with  a focus on the population  residing in rural  areas and slums,\nthe women,  and the poorer  segments of  society;  (ii)  provision  of adequate referral  backup\nservices  including  emergency  care; (iii)  training  and retaining  of medical  staff  to improve\nquality  of  services;  (iv)  addressing  gender  imbalance,  both  in  provision  and delivery  of\nservices;  (v)  encouraging  public-private  partnerships;  and  (vi)  granting  administrative\nautonomy  to the hospitals.\n12.  The major  source of drinking  water  in Punjab is groundwater.  However,  in\n26 districts,  there are significant  pockets of water scarcity  or brackish  sub-soil  water where\nabout  10,000 villages  are located.  About  94 % households  have water  source  inside the\nhouse. The remaining  6% households  use unsafe water from shallow  wells,  rivers  or canals\nthat are often  located at a considerable  distance, with  the burden of  fetching  water  largely\nfalling  on women. Treatment  of public  water supplies  is undertaken only  at few places and\neven that is on a limited  scale. The infrastructure  for water supply and sanitation  (WSS) was\ndeveloped  in the past without  analyzing  the feasibility  of operation  and maintenance  costs.\nAs  a  result  several  hundred  poorly  designed  rural  water  supply  schemes  have  been\nabandoned. Access to sanitation  facilities  is extremely  limited  with  only  32%  of  the rural\npopulation  having  household  latrine  facility.  Gap  expects  PHED  to  support  quality\nassurance  and  capacity  building,  with  a  focus  on  imprvoing  sanitation  and  gradually\ndevolving  authority  for technical  sanctions to TMAs.\n13.  Following  devolution,  the Public  Health  Engineering  Department  has been\nmerged with  the Local  Government  and Rural  Development  Department  and continues to\ncarry  out  the major  development  schemes. TMAs  have  been made  responsible  for  the\nprovision  of  municipal  services  including  water  and sanitation,  but  they  lack  capacity  in\nparticipatory  planning  and  implementation  and  in  managing  these  services  adequately\nthrough  community  infrastructure.  However,  Government  of  Punjab  has  substantially\nincreased expenditures  on WSS  schemes, growing  from  Rs. 601 million  in FY2002  to Rs\n5,536 million  in FY2004.\n14.  GoPunjab  is  committed  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  public  schools  by\nstrengthening  school  councils.  Under  the  PESRP,  GoPunjab  is piloting  models  of  school\ncouncils.  More  models  of  school  councils  have  to be explored  to recognize  the  differences\nacross  districts.  DSSP  will  pilot  other  forms  of  school  councils  to  increase  enrolment\nparticularly  of girls,  to improve  quality  by  providing  more  resources  and  support  to schools\nas  well  as  by  improving  attendance  of  students  and  teachers.  As  part  of  GoPunjab's\ncommitment  to  provide  equal  opportunities  to  all  children  to  attend  schools,  DSSP  will\nexplore  different  options  to support  special  education  to enroll  children  with  special  needs.\n15.  The  Government  of  Punjab  is  committed  to  its  poverty  reduction  and\ngovernance refom1s programme.  There is strong political  commitment  to address challenges\nfaced  by  tho  social  sectors  by  pursuing  a  policy  agenda  that  could  lead  to  tangible\ninlprovementa  in  the  quality,  efficiency,  access and  effectiveness  of  the  social  sector\nservices. especially  for the poor  and vulnerable  populations.  The Devolved  Social  Services\nProgramme  (DSSP) bas been developed  with  support  from  ADB,  after  extensive  dialogue\nwith  and incorporating  the  views  of  the local  governrnents,  NGOs.  service  providers  and\nbeneficiaries.  The design of DSSP is based on essential policy  refonns  which  will  create an\nenabling  environment  for the local governments to finance the identified  institutional.  social,\nplanning,  managerial.  financial  and  capacity  needs of  social  sector  servjces  that  are not\nfinanced  from other sources.\n16.  The  DSSP  will  provide  flexible  support  to  the  district  governments,  TMAs\nand  NGOs/CBO  based  on  perceived  local  needs  and  priorities.  Only  a \"short  negative  list\"\nwill  restrict  the  utilization  of  funds  by  specifying  activities  on  which  the  funds  made\navailable  to the local  goven1ments  would  not  be spent,  combined  with  a broad  positive  list\nwould  allow  sectoral  investments  in the priority  areas in line  with  policies  and  strategies  to\nachieve  MDGs.  This  approach  is  expected  to  incentivize  the  districts  and  participating\nTMAs  to prioritize  and  implement  their  programmes  to meet  the MDGs.  In  this  process,  it\nis anticipated  that  the  much  n.eeded  capacity  at the  provincial  and  local  government  level\nwould  improve  to strengthen  devolved  social  services  in line  with  the PLGO.", "Appendix5   51\nLetter ~ Development  Policy-ADS\n17.  The  refonns  proposed  under  the DSSP fonn  an integral  part of  the  wide-\nranging  economic and social sector refonns  launched by the Government  of Punjab with  the\nsupport  of multilateral  and bilateral  donors,  such as the World  Bank  through  the Punjab\nEducation  Sector  Refonn  programme;  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  through  its\nDevolution  Support  Programme  that  strengthens capacity  of  local  governments;  the ADB\nwith  its  Punjab Resource  Management  Programme  to operationalize  provincial  goals  and\npriorities  of  PRSP  with  focus  on  social  sectors;  the  ADB  with  its  Access  to  Justice\nProgramme  to bring  about judicial  refonns;  the four ADB  projects  in health and water  and\nsanitation  ~tors  for  improving  reproductive  health  and municipal  services  respectively;\nand  other UN assisted projects  in the social sectors.\n18.  The  local  governments  will  enter in  tenDS of  partnership  (TOP)  with  the\nGovernment  of  Punjab  to  deliver  basic  package of  essential services  within  each social\nsector using funds from  all sources. The TOP will  indicate eligibility  criteria  for funding  the\ndistricts  and define broadly  the scope of areas to be supported.  The funds will  be channeled\nthrough  Account  IV  under  PFC, based on a transparent and predictable  fonnula  through  a\nconditional  grants system.\n19.  The  government  of  the  Punjab  will  develop  a five  year  strategic  plan  for\nimprovement  of  delivery  of  social  services  in the province.  The  district  governments  will\ndevelop  three year rolling  plans based on the policy  guidance available  through  provincial\nfive  year plan. The District  governments  will  be able to .:cess  funding  for the social sectors\non the basis of rolling  plans identifying  the overall strategy of the district  government  for the\nsector. A baseline for all key outcome.  perfonnance  indicators  and expenditure  benchmarks\nwill  be established that would  facilitate  the monitoring  ofrefornl  interventions.\n20.  The  govemnlent  of  the  Punjab  with  the  involvement  of  the  district\ngovernments will  decide  mode of recruitment  for each category of staff  for the social sector\ndepartments. In order to enhance accountability  and address governance  issues. a transparent\nrecruitment  process will  be developed  and implemented  for all  recruitments  in the districts\nand the province.  The proposed  mechanism  may involve  third  party  for either carrying  out\nrecruitment  process or monitoring  this process. However. adequate weightage  will  be given\nto local and female candidates.\n21.  There  are major  programmatic  and financing  gaps in the public  health sector.\nThe  focus  of  DSSP  will  be  to:  improve  reproductive  health  services  through  trained\nmidwives;  transforming  the  current  service  package into  essential  pro-poor  package  of\nservices; improving  staff  mix  and skill  mix  backed by skill  development;  expanding  public\nprivate  partnerships;  and improving  internal  and external  monitoring  systems. The  RHCs\natld  tehsil  hospital  would  provide  24-hour  emergency services  at  least  for  women  and\nchildren  to improve  survival  rate of  children  and pregnant women.  To  ensure high  quality\nand reliable  services,  all  the vacant positions  will  be filled  besides trying  facility  specific\ncontractual  appointment  of  the health  staff,  with  incentives  built-in  for  remote  areas. In\nremote  areas, innovative  models  like  contracting  out  of  primary  health  care services  to\nreputed NGOs will  be expanded.\n22.  To  ensure  participation  of  the  local  communities  in  running  the  health\nfacilities,  health comn1ittees at district  and tehsil hospitals will  be established, and given  the\nauthority  to  generate  additional  resources  and use for  improving  the  quality  of  health\nservices. The proposed  committees  will  provide  safety net for  protection  of poor  in a way\nthat services are not refused to anyone  just  for financial  reasons. These improvements  will\nbe backed by consolidation  and up-gradation  of existing health infrastructure.\n23.  GoPunja~  has identified  WSS  as a major  means  of  improving  preventive\nhealth  services. The  priority  fl,lture interventions  under DSSP,  besides expansion  of  water\nand sanitation coverage  in ,44 ;TMAs  that do not receive support  from  any other projects  or\nprogrammes,  include  preparation  of sector strategic plan, development  of  integrated  master\nplan  and prioritized  annual  plan  for  each TMA.  The  community  motivation  will  be an\nintegral  part of the programme  to organize  NGOs, CCBs, CBOs  and water user committees\nto guitie sustainability  of future investments.  The TMA  will  be encouraged  and supported to\ndevelop special promotional  campaigns  for rapidly  increasing availability  of minimum  basic\nsanitation  facilities  in  the  rural  areas. The  capacity  of  the  TMAs  will  be developed  for", "52  Appendix 5\nLetter of Development PoIk:y-ADB\nmonitoring  of quality  of drinking  water.\n24.  To  enhance the  effectiveness  of the proposed  DSSP interventions.  a set of\npolicy  guidelines.  an institutional  framework  and terms of engagement clearly  delineate the\nroles  and  responsibilities  of  different  collaborating  agencies  will  be  developed  and\nrigorously  implemented.  These  operating  procedures.  coupled  with  support  to  local\ngovernments  to rationalize  services. would procJucet he kind  of fiscal and planning  discipline\nthat is needed to improve  the performance  and efficiency  of the social sectors.\n25.  The Governnlent  of Punjab also recognizes the need to improve  the capability\nof  local  governments.  as they  are increasingly  assuming greater responsibilities.  through a\ncombination  of  specific  and  overarching  capacity  building  efforts.  to  develop  and\nimplement  sector  specific  plans.  and  to  ensure service  and  technical  standards  through\ncommunity  participation  .nd  innovative  alterantives. For the first 30 months of the DSSP. the\nlocal  governments  will  be assisted in the preparation of these plans. with  varying  degree of\nsupport. through  the office  of the Programme Support Unit  aIxl Local S~rt  Groups.\n26.  A  Programme  Support  Unit  (PSU). managed by highly  skilled  and dedicated\nstaff  from  three line  departments.  attached to the Department  of Health.  will  be established\nas the secretariat  of the Planning  and Development  Department.  The office  of each District\nCoordination  Officer  will  be strengthened  by providing  a number  of  resource  persons to\nprovide  technical  assistance to the district  governments  in managing the policy  reforms and\nimplementation  of  programme  innovations  under a flexible  arrangement.  A  high-powered\nSteering Committee  cltaired  by lite Chairman. Plannina Board.  with  representation of all the\nconcerned  departments.  will  oversee the overall  programme  execution.  In order to ensure\ncoordination  with  the Decentmlization  Support Progranune and Punjab Resource Management\nProgmmme. the respective programme directors will  be represented on the steering committee.\nIn addition  to this. the Planning  &  Development Department  will  share the reviews of other\nrelevant programmes  and projects  with  lhe steering committee  to provide regular  feedback to\nDSSP implementation.\n27.  The Government  of the Punjab is confident  of the sustainability  of the DSSP\nrefonns  because: (i)  policies  of similar  nature are pursued at the federal level;  (ii)  the fiscal\nsituation  will  improve  substantially  and there will  be adequate fiscal  space for  continuing\nwith  programme interventions  in the future from the savings on debt servicing  arising  from\nimproved  debt management and accelerated repayments of debt under the Education  Sector\nRefonns  Programme,  PRMP  and DSSP; and (c) that the counterpart  funds generated from\nADF  portion  of  tile  loan  for  the  proposed  social  sector  interventions  will  be channeled\nthrough the district  Account  number  IV.\n28.  You  will  agree that these initiatives  require substantial  financial  and technical\nsupport  backed by political  commitment.  which  already  exists  at all levels  of  government.\nWe are confident  that the DSSP will  make a subst8J\\tial contribution  to the achievement  of\nthis  objective.  We  will  thus be grateful  for  your  support  in  obtaining  financial  assistance\nfrom  Asian  Development  Bank  for  on-lending  to  Punjab.  to  enable  us to  carry  out  the\nrefont\\s  under Punjab Devolved  Social Services Programme.\nWith  best regards.\nYours sincerely,\n---1-t~.n'Y\"_4.;.A/I\n(SARDAR  HASNAIN  BAHADUR  DARESHAK)\nMr.  Shujah  Shah,\nSecretary.  Economic  Affairs  Division,\nGovernment  of  Pakistan,\nIslarnabad.", "  Appendix 6  53 \nUSE OF CONDITIONAL GRANTS \nA.  Principles of Use of Funds \n \n1.  The funds available under the Program serve the twin purposes of acting as an incentive \nfor different tiers of the Government to undertake and sustain policy actions, as well providing \nsome  fiscal  support  for  local  governments  (LGs)  to  engage  in  social  sector  delivery \nimprovements. By themselves, the funds are neither sufficient to finance any specific gaps in \nthe social sectors, nor are they meant to act as investments funds alone. The definitions of the \nscope of use of these funds, as well as the institutional mechanisms through which they are to \nbe used by the local governments, thus assume paramount importance. Within the overarching \nframework of the Program and generally following the principle of finance following function, the \nfunds would be proposed for use in a manner that supports and leads to the achievement of the \nprogram goals and objectives and the specific actions outlined in the policy matrix for the \nProgram. While aiming to provide optimal flexibility to the LGs to enable efficient choices for \ninvestments aimed at improving social services, the proposed use of funds would at the same \ntime adopt mechanisms that enable the Punjab Government (PG) to ensure that the processes \nof targeted, accountable, and participatory sector planning at the LG level are strengthened and \nthe investments are pro-poor and gender-sensitive. The distribution of funds proposed would \nprovide for clear, predictable, and transparent funding to LGs. \n \nB.  Allocation of Funds \n \n2.  The counterpart funds generated by the Program will be used to finance a package of \npolicy reforms. The distribution of program funds need to be based on a set of clear, objective, \nand relevant criteria that take into account the sector focus of the Program and the specific \nelements of the policy matrix, so as to ensure that there is a fit between the funding and the \npolicy actions in a manner that leads to the achievement of the program objectives. In arriving at \nthese distribution criteria, a number of aspects need to be considered, including the following. \n \n3.  Sector Distribution. Given the availability of funds in the social sectors from both the \nGovernment\u2019s own resources, as well as from external assistance agencies, and also in view of \nthe priorities of the government of Punjab and financing gaps identified, it is proposed that the \nprogram funds be distributed among the health, education, and water and sanitation sectors in \nthe ratio of 65:17:18. The district governments (DGs) will receive 82% of all program funds for \nhealth and education and the tehsil (town) municipal administrations (TMAs) will receive 18%. \n \n4.  Fund for Promoting Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). In order to promote PPPs \nfor  improving  social  services  in  terms  of  access,  delivery  or  monitoring,  it  is  proposed  to \napportion some program funds to be used as a fund for PPPs. In line with the Punjab Local \nGovernment Ordinance 2001 (PLGO 2001), which calls for allocating 25% of the total budget for \nengagement with citizen community boards (CCBs), it is proposed that the DGs and program \nTMAs also apportion 25% of funds for purposes of PPPs. However, the mechanism for use of \nthese funds will differ from that in the PLGO 2001 in that the allocations by the LGs will not be \nconditional upon equity financing from partners from the private sector in the PPP. This PPP \nfund will be available for use by all community-based organizations (CBOs), nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), CCBs, school councils (SCs), patient welfare associations (PWAs), and \nprivate sector firms, subject to their meeting the basic eligibility criteria for participation, to be \ndeveloped under the Program. \n ", "54  Appendix 6   \n5.  Targeting. In order to ensure that the program funds are targeted toward pro-poor, \ngender-sensitive  investments,  DGs  and  program  TMAs  would  be  encouraged,  during  the \nprocess of developing the annual sector plans and the 3-year rolling sector plans, to prioritize \nexpenditures that target women and poor segments of the population. As the conditional grant \nsystem evolves into a more sophisticated policy transmittal instrument from the second year of \nthe Program onwards, targeting would be achieved by including incentives for targeting in the \ndistribution  formula  itself  and/or  as  part  of  the  eligibility  and  access  conditions  in  the \nmemorandum of understanding (MOU) between the PG and participating LGs for conditional \ngrants.  \n \n6.  Performance  Incentives.  There  is  also  a  need  to  establish  some  performance \nincentives for the LGs, so as to move them away from pure input-based criteria for distribution \nand toward more output- and outcome-based criteria, so that LGs are rewarded for efforts and \nresults to improve social services.  \n \nC.  Distribution Formula \n \n7.  It is proposed that the formula for distribution of program funds be clear, objective, and \nrelevant to the program objectives. The formula should follow needs-based distribution criteria \nthat also contain elements of performance-based incentives. Given that the Punjab Devolved \nSocial Services Program (PDSSP) focuses on poor and deprived locations, it is proposed that \nfor the first tranche release, 70% of the funds be based on population and 30% on the Social \nPolicy Development Center deprivation index to focus more on the 15 most deprived districts. \nThe second tranche release would be determined by the provincial finance commission (PFC), \nwhich will also introduce performance criteria as discussed in para. 6 above. \n \nD.  Institutional Mechanism  \n \n8.  Under  the  PLGO,  PFCs  were  established  with  a  view  to  providing  an  institutional \narrangement for fiscal transfers from provinces to LGs. PDSSP proposes to use the PFC as the \ninstitutional mechanism to transfer funds under the Program. These transfers would be in the \nshape of conditional grants that would provide for clear, transparent, and predictable shares of \nthe LGs based on a PFC-approved formula. The PFC would also approve the eligibility criteria, \nthe access conditions, and the performance measurement indicators for the conditional grants \nand would in conjunction with the program steering committee (PSC) for PDSSP, monitor the \nuse of funds periodically. Upon approval of the distribution formula, the PFC would make public \nthe annual allocations of each DG and program TMA, well before the new financial year begins, \nso as to allow the LGs to have a clear indication of the funds that would be available\u2014in the first \nyear of the Program\u2014to them outside the PFC award and other transfers from PG, as a \nsupplementary grant. \n \nE.  Transfer of Funds \n \n9.  The share of the DGs and program TMAs, as determined through the PFC-approved \ndistribution formula will flow from the provincial government to the district fund and the TMA \nfund directly from Account IV within 30 days of the eligible LGs meeting the access conditions \nfor the conditional grants. These access conditions would include the LGs signing an MOU with \nPG, agreeing to a set of conditions under which the funds can be used, such as minimum \nstandards  of  performance,  improving  participation  in  decision  making,  agreeing  to  use \nconditional grants within defined scope of activities, and meeting reporting requirements for the \nconditional grants.  ", "  Appendix 6  55 \n \nF.  Use of Funds \n \n10.  The  conditional  grant  mechanism  developed  for  the  PDSSP  funds  aims  to  provide \noptimal levels of flexibility to LGs in use of funds. This is achieved by defining the scope of \nactivities and investments commensurate with the policy actions outlined under the Program \nthrough a positive and a negative list. An attempt has been made to make the positive list least \nprescriptive in nature, support the autonomous status of the LGs, and strengthen their ability to \nmake investment choices in a manner that fits within the overall program framework. Likewise, \nthe negative list is a lean list aiming to safeguard accountable and responsible use of funds by \nthe LGs. Both the positive and negative lists will be subject to review every year with the \nobjective of facilitating and providing incentives to LGs to assume more ownership and control \nof planning, budgeting, and monitoring processes to improve social services.  \n \nG.  Accountability \n \n11.  The flexibility in use of funds that is being proposed under PDSSP calls for sufficient \nsafeguards against misuse of funds and abuse of the flexible approach. These safeguards \nwould include: (i) establishing a tracking and auditing and reporting of conditional grants going \nto  LGs;  (ii)  increased  participatory  planning  and  monitoring  at  the  LG  level;  (iii)  improved \nperformance  of  the  sector  monitoring  committees;  (iv)  setting  of  performance  standards, \nbenchmarks, and establishing citizen charters; and (v) taking effective measures to ensure \ntransparency and improve public information on social services. \n \nH.  Disincentives for Deviant Behavior \n \n12.  Despite the mechanisms being put in place to support and encourage LGs to improve \nperformance in the delivery of social services, there is always the risk that some LGs may not \nbe able to meet the conditions set under the Program. A disincentive for LGs not meeting the \nrequirements is proposed to be built in the form of withholding further releases to such LGs in \nthe year that follows. The funds that thus become available are proposed to be pooled into the \nPunjab Development Fund, from where they can be accessed by other, better performing LGs \nas performance grants. The criteria for accessing these would be determined by the program \nsteering committee and approved by the PFC. However, mechanisms will be put in place to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to districts that are lagging behind due to capacity problems. \n \nI.  Sustainability \n \n13.  To provide sustenance to this initiative of supporting the PG to improve its fiscal space \nand increase investments in the social sectors, PG will need to (i) refine the medium-term \nbudgetary framework based on a realistic estimate of the sources and generation of financial \nresources and (ii) demonstrate a level of political commitment and provide adequate assurances \non the policy actions required to enable the program funds to have a meaningful impact on \nsocial services by institutionalizing processes for accountable use of these funds.  \n \n14.  PDSSP also has a TA component for building the capacity of the LGs in improving social \nservices. This component would, in conjunction with the ongoing work of a number of other \ninitiatives  such  as  the  Punjab  Resource  Management  Program,  Decentralization  Support \nProgram, and the Punjab Education Sector Reform Program, help improve systems, processes, \nand monitoring and evaluation at the LG level specifically for the social sectors. ", "56   Appendix 7   \nSOCIAL SECTOR FINANCING IN PUNJAB \n \n \n1.  Pakistan and Punjab Economy. Punjab plays an important role in the economy of \nPakistan. Its population is estimated at 82 million, approximately 56% of the Pakistan\u2019s total \npopulation. Punjab plays a leading role in agricultural production in Pakistan, contributing about \n68% to the annual food grain production. Since 23% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of \nPakistan is from the agriculture sector, and the provincial GDP accounts for 57% of the national \nGDP,1 any changes in the productivity in Punjab will have a substantial impact on GDP growth. \nThus, given Punjab\u2019s population size and the extent of economic activity it generates, Punjab's \ndevelopment performance has a significant impact on the economy of Pakistan as a whole. Its \nsocial indicators mirror overall country indicators, with some marginally better and some worse.  \n \n2.  Government Financial Sources. As shown in Table A7.1, the total financial resources \nof the Punjab Government (PG) grew at an average annual rate of 11.0% between FY2000/01, \nand was PRs155.6 billion in FY2003/04. The financial resources were sourced from revenue \nreceipts and development grants. While development grants have been declining, revenue \nreceipts, on the other hand, have increased. Revenue receipts grew at an average annual \ngrowth rate of 12.5%. The revenue receipts consist of approximately 80% federal transfers \n(taxes and nontax transfers), and 20% provincial revenue receipts. Development grants have \ndeclined substantially in the last 5 fiscal years, from PRs4 billion in FY2000/01 to PRs89 million \nin FY2003/04. \n \n3.  The budget estimate for FY2004/05 for revenue receipts was forecast at PR180.0 billion \nin the Medium-Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF), increasing by 15.7% from the revised \nbudget of the previous year. Higher growth was forecast on the assumption that (i) the amount \nof the federal transfer would increase as a result of improved revenue collection of federal \ntaxes, (ii) federal Government would provide provincial governments with financial support for \nmeeting the expenditure on account of a 15% pay increase announced in the federal budget, \nand (iii) PG would be able to at least maintain the previous year\u2019s provincial revenue collection \nperformance. \n \n4.  Government Budget. The total budget increased at an annual average growth rate of \n13.8% between FY2000/01 and FY2003/04, and was PRs170.4 billion in FY2003/04. Three-\nquarters of the total budget are for revenue expenditures and the remainder for the development \nbudget. The revenue expenditure budget increased at an average annual growth rate of 9.9% \nbetween FY2000/01 and FY2003/04 and was PRs130.9 billion in FY2003/04. Until FY2001/02, \nmore than a third of the revenue expenditure budget was allocated to social services. Since the \nadministrative devolution of PG, beginning in FY2002/03, about half of the revenue expenditure \nbudget has been allocated to grants for local governments. The level of the revenue expenditure \nbudget has never exceeded the revenue receipts between FY2001/02 and FY2003/04, and the \nrevenue surplus has increased over the last 4 fiscal years. The increase was partly a result of a \nreduction in debt servicing,2 from PRs15.7 billion (17.4% of revenue expenditure) in FY2000/01 \nto PRs14.3 billion (8.4% of revenue expenditure) in FY2003/04.

MTBF identified education, health, and WSS sectors \nas the major critical sectors, among others, in the next 3 fiscal years. MTBF thus reflects a \nsubstantially higher social sector budget in 2004/05 and maintains the increased budget level \nfor the following 3 fiscal years. The total of the revenue and development expenditure budgets \nin FY2004/05 for education, health and WSS sectors increased by 22.8%, 29.1%, and 311.2%, \nrespectively, and the growth rate would be maintained at 11% annually thereafter. During the \nprogram implementation period, as a result of MTBF, the revenue expenditure budget of the \nsocial sectors will increase by PRs27.2 billion ($477 million) and the development expenditure \nbudget by PRs7.4 billion ($130 million). \n \n10.  Financing Gap in MTBF. Table A7.4 shows that the proposed expenditures under \nMTBF is greater than the forecast revenue receipts for the next 3 fiscal years, thus producing a \nfinancing  gap.  Under  MTBF,  PG  estimates  that  revenue  receipts  will  grow  by  18.4%  in ", "60   Appendix 7   \nFY2005/06 and by 12.9% in FY2006/07 and FY2007/08; revenue expenditures will grow at a \nslower pace, by 18.1% in FY2005/06, and 12.8% in FY2006/07 and FY2007/08. The slower \ngrowth is mainly due to the gradual reduction in debt servicing. As a result, the revenue surplus \nis expected to grow by 22.6% in the FY2005/06 and 14.4% in FY2006/07 and FY2007/08. This \nwill allow PG to allocate more resources to the development expenditure budget, which will \ngrow  faster  than  revenue  receipts,  20.2%  in  FY2005/06  and  13.6%  in  FY2006/07  and \nFY2007/08. PG would be able to increase the development expenditure by creating fiscal space \nthrough  debt  service  reduction.  Nevertheless,  the  growing  revenue  surplus  alone  is  not \nsufficient to finance the development expenditure budget necessary to implement the poverty \nreduction strategy of PG. Consequently, there is a financing gap of PRs8.7 billion ($153 million) \nin  FY2004/5,  PRs9.6  billion  ($169  million)  in  FY2005/06,  PRs10.6  billion  ($186  million)  in \nFY2006/07, and PRs11.6 billion ($204 million) in FY2007/08 as shown in Table A7.3. Since \nabout less than a third of the development expenditure budget is generally allocated to social \nsectors, the financing gap in the social sectors during the implementation of the proposed \nProgram is estimated at, at least, PRs9.6 billion ($169 million). \n \nTable A7.4: Punjab Medium Term Budgetary Framework, FY2004/05\u2013FY2007/08 \n(PRs million) \n  Annual Growth Rate \n2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08 \n(%) \nItem  BE  MTBF  MTBF  MTBF  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08 \n               \nA.

Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Preparing the Punjab Devolved Social \nServices Sector Development Program. Manila (TA 4183).  \n \n \n11.  Proposed  Program  and  MTBF.  The  proposed  Program  was  designed  in  line  with \nMTBF and the poverty reduction strategy, and will provide budget support to the financing gap ", "Appendix 7       61  \nin  the  social  sectors.  The  funding  requirement  for  implementing  policy  actions  under  the \nproposed Program would be about equal to the financing gap, as the policy actions under the \nproposed Program are a translation of the planned activities under MTBF. An attempt was made \nto estimate the funding requirement, by calculating the approximate cost of achieving the major \ntarget indicators in the program framework. \n \n12.  In the education sector, it is assumed that female gross enrollment rates in primary and \nmiddle schools will improve from 70% to 75% and from 43% to 50%, respectively, during the \nprogram period, an increase of approximately 258,000 pupils. Since 69% of female pupils are in \npublic schools, PG requires financing for additional 178,000 pupils and 1,723 new schools. \nAssuming that the per capita annual recurrent cost is $47, the construction cost of a school is \n$20,000,  and  the  rehabilitation  cost  of  an  existing  school  and  other  expenses  for \noperationalizing school councils are $1,800, the 3-year total cost would be about $58.8 million. \n \n13.  In the health sector, it is assumed that the proportion of lowest income quintile accessing \nservices will increase by 20% from the base year. There are 17 million people in the lowest \nquintile, and the current access rate is 46%. In order to increase the access rate by 20% during \nthe  program  period,  PG  would  have  to  finance  the  cost  of  an  additional  2 million  people \ngradually accessing health services in 3 years. Since the cost of essential health services is \nestimated at $17 per person per year, the 3-year total cost would be $82.8 million. Furthermore, \nthe number of health centers and their staff would have to increase to deliver the essential \nhealth services and improve access; this would cost about $8.5 million in 3 years. The total fund \nrequirement in the health sector in 3 years would be $91.2 million. \n \n14.  In the WSS sector, it is assumed that access to water sources will improve from 94% to \n96%. This requires the supply of safe water to an additional 1.5 million people.

The  Program  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  System  (PPMES)  under  the \nPunjab Devolved Social Services Program (PDSSP) will comprise several elements to ensure \nimproved  monitoring  at  provincial  as  well  as  local  government  (LG)  levels.  The  following \nparagraphs explain these elements.  \n \n(i)  Benchmarking. A major area to be addressed by the program support unit to be \nestablished by loan negotiations is to develop a set of monitoring benchmarks \nagainst which the progress of the Program will be assessed. These benchmarks \nlargely  include  indicators  provided  in  the  program  framework  and  required \ninformation as per the policy matrix. The information for these indicators come \nfrom different sources, including regular surveys such as the Pakistan Integrated \nHousehold Survey (carried out by the Government of Pakistan) and follow-on \nsurveys  such  as  (Multiple  Indicator  Cluster  Survey)  to  be  supported  by  the \nProgram.  A  major  emphasis  will  be  to  establish  benchmark  for  financial \nallocations to the social sectors and percentage of expenditures achieved each \nyear at the provincial and local government levels. Benchmarks will also be \nestablished for indicators relating to the Millennium Development Goals in order \nto indicate the effort Punjab Government would have to exert to ensure meeting \ninterim targets in order to be on track to meet the targets by 2015. A draft set of \nbenchmarks for the education, health, and water supply and sanitation sectors is \nattached with Appendix 2 but this will be modified to link more closely with the \nprogram framework (Appendix 1) and policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n(ii)  Management Information Systems. Other major sources of information for the \neducation and health sectors are the Punjab education management information \nsystem (PEMIS) and the health sector management information system (HMIS). \nWhile the PEMIS is more developed and reliable than the HMIS, the intention is \nto  draw  information  on  key  indicators  from  these  systems,  and  to  provide \ntargeted  support  to  improve  these  systems  in  order  to  enhance  the  use, \nreliability, and timeliness of information generated by these systems. Key users \nof the information will be identified and reports will be improved accordingly. \n \n(iii)  Monitoring Framework. A major emphasis of PDSSP is to improve the overall \nmonitoring capacity of the provincial line departments as well as the LGs. The \npolicy reforms include two policy actions to support improved monitoring: (a) \nstrengthening  social  sector  monitoring  systems  including  the  management \ninformation  systems  and  enhanced  disclosure  on  social  services;  and  (b) \nstrengthening the capacity of local council monitoring committees in order to \nensure that monitoring functions are institutionalized in line with the provisions of \nthe Punjab Local Government Ordinance (PLGO). This process will also support \nthe local government council, which is the lead agency for facilitating overall \nmonitoring  functions  of  the  LGs.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  component \nincludes provisions to support provincial line departments and LGs to develop \nand strengthen their monitoring mechanisms and capacities. \n  \n(iv)   Third Party Evaluation. The TA component of the Punjab Devolved Social \nServices Program (PDSSP) includes provision to conduct third party evaluations \n(TPEs) to assess progress directly associated with the Program and TA. The \nTPEs  will  focus  on  inputs,  process,  outputs,  and  outcome  indicators  to  be ", "    Appendix 10  65\nfinalized  by  program  effectiveness,  and  will  determine  absolute  and  relative \nimprovements made over time. The TPEs will include formative and summative \nevaluations. The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) covering key indicators \nin the social sectors will be repeated to review the progress made under PDSSP.  \n \n(v)  Linkages. The PPMES will establish linkages with other relevant programs, such \nas  the  Punjab  Resource  Management  Program,  Decentralization  Support \nProgram, and Punjab Education Sector Reform Program, to ensure consistency \nand  synergy,  as  these  programs  are  also  supporting  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) system. \n \n2.  In order to institutionalize M&E capacity as envisaged under the PLGO, monitoring \nspecialists are planned at the provincial and LG levels under the TA component. Tentative \nterms of reference are provided below:  \n \n(i)  Monitoring and evaluation specialist at provincial level (30 person-months). \nThe consultant will (a) take a lead role for M&E in the program support unit, (b) \ncoordinate with M&E sections of the provincial line department and LGs through \ndistrict-level  monitoring  expert  in  the  areas  of  M&E,  (c)  coordinate  with \nmanagement  information  specialist  (MIS)  specialist  for  developing  a  M&E \nframework to effectively monitor DSSP activities and track progress against the \nassurances and milestones contained in the policy matrix and annual plans, (d) \nassist the program support unit in preparing progress reports on time, (e) support \nM&E experts at district level in developing the capacity of the LG staff and \ncouncil monitoring committees, and (f) undertake periodic review of M&E reports \nprepared by provincial line departments and provide ongoing assistance. \n \n(ii)  Monitoring and evaluation expert at district level (30 person-months). The \nconsultant will (a) support and coordinate monitoring activities at LG level; (b) \ncoordinate  with  provincial-level  M&E  specialist  and  seek  guidance  for \nstreamlining M&E activities at LG level; (c) train LG staff in routine M&E and in \npreparing quarterly progress reports for review by the respective LG councils; \nand  (d)  design  user-friendly  monitoring  tools  for  LG  monitoring  committees, \ntraining members of committees monitoring in use of monitoring tools.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \nContribution of sectors/subsectors to reduce poverty in Pakistan (Punjab province) \n \nThe decade of 1990s in Pakistan witnessed increasing incidence of poverty. The reason for increasing poverty is due \nto a decade long slowdown in economic growth, decline in public and private investments, increase in fiscal and \ncurrent account deficits, and rapid debt accumulation. In late 2000, the Government of Pakistan adopted Interim \nPoverty Reduction Strategy, which was updated in 2003. The core elements of the strategy are to engender growth, \nimprove human development and governance, and reduce vulnerability of the poor to shocks.  \n \nPunjab as the largest province of Pakistan, faces two challenges of reviving economic growth and reducing poverty. \nIncidence of poverty in the province is around 34.1%, which was 28.2% in 1993/94. The urban-rural gap is significant \nand poverty increased more rapidly in rural areas than in the urban areas from 31.9% in 1993/94 to 37.0% in 2001/02. \nThe incidence of poverty is much higher in southern Punjab. In southern Punjab, the level of economic development \nand income is lower than in northern Punjab. While urban areas in northern Punjab had the lowest level of poverty \nin the country (13%), southern Punjab showed the highest level of urban poverty in Pakistan (35% in 1999, up from 28% \nin  1993).  In  northern  Punjab  a  great  deal  of  development  efforts  and  investments,  especially  industrial \ninvestments, has been concentrated in recent years.  \n \nSince 2002/03, the poverty reduction strategy and program of the Government of Punjab has made a major \ndeparture from the past in terms of increased financing for the social sectors and taking initiatives to improve public \nsector governance. The strengthening of devolution of the social services through Punjab\u2019s Local Government \nOrdinance 2001 (PLGO) is well advanced than other provinces. So far 16 consequential pieces of legislations have \nbeen passed to strengthen the local government system. According to the Local Government Ordinance, education up \nto secondary level, primary health, and referral services up to district hospitals have been devolved to the district \ngovernments, while tehsil (town) municipal administrations are made responsible for water supply and sanitation \nsector as part of municipal services. The local government services, as conceived, are expected to improve quality, \nefficiency, and accountability of social services through improved resource allocation, participatory decision making, \nand by solving problems using local solutions. \n \nThe poverty partnership agreement between the Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nreflects the Government's vision for poverty reduction and improving the quality and access of social services, \nespecially for the poor. The Government has agreed that long-term poverty reduction requires focus on good \ngovernance, increased allocation of funds for social sectors, and improving basic social services to enhance \nhuman development. ADB supports governance reforms through the Decentralization Support Program and \nother ongoing sector programs and projects undertaken by the Government. The goal of the Punjab Devolved \nSocial  Services  Program  (PDSSP)  is  to  strengthen  devolved  social  services  to  achieve  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) related to poverty, gender, education, health, water and sanitation. Specifically, \nthe PDSSP will have the following focus: (i) realign intergovernment relations to support devolved social \nservices; (ii) rationalize and set minimum service standards for social services; and (iii) strengthen public \naccountability mechanisms and promote public-private partnership. In addition, it will also enhance social \nsector financing and allocative efficiency. PDSSP supports improving quality and access of three social sectors \n(health, education, and water supply and sanitation), by human resource development in three tiers of local \ngovernments  (LGs)  in  the  social  sector,  and  stakeholders  participation  at  grassroots  level  in  planning, \nmanaging, and monitoring of social sector services. It is expected that PDSSP intervention would have an impact on \nincreased efficiency in service delivery mechanism in the three tiers of LGs. \n  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                             Targeting Classification:  Targeted Intervention  \nPunjab is the largest Province in Pakistan with 83 million (56%) of population, of which 32% lives in more than 215 \nurban localities and 30 large towns and cities. The poverty characteristics in Punjab are almost similar to the \ncharacteristics of other part of Pakistan. The incidence of poverty in Punjab is around 34.1% and it was 28.2% in \n1993/94. The urban-rural gap is significant and poverty increased more rapidly in rural areas from 31.9% in 1993 to \n37.0% in 2001/02. The poverty in Punjab is described in broader terms of income,  consumption,  social  services  and \nbasic needs of urban and rural population. A study on district profile ranked 34 districts of Punjab, and the findings of \nthe study suggest that out of the total  districts, 10  districts  have  been  classified  as  highly  deprived  in  descending ", " 68 Appendix 12 \norder: Rajanpur, Muzaffargarh, DG Khan, Layyah, Lodhran, Bhakkar, Pakpattan, Rahimyar Khan, Bahawalpur, and \nJhang. Seven of these most deprived districts fall in southern Punjab. Poverty is multidimensional is influenced by \nboth economic and social factors. The of poverty in southern Punjab is largely due to limited growth of the \nagriculture sector, which is related to feudal agriculture, droughts, and increasing shortage of water. Punjab is \nclosely associated with feudal agriculture, drought, water shortage and lack of social sector service.  \n \nSome  of  the  characteristics  of  the  rural  poverty  are:  (i)  dependence  on  daily  wage  labor  in  agriculture  and \nnonagricultural activities, brick kiln, petty vending, etc; (ii) high indebtedness to private money lenders; (iii) no land or \nany other assets; (iv) lack of access government services (health, education, water); and (v) no voice and no role in \ndecision making in the community.  \n \nIn Punjab inequalities of provision of social services exist among the households from different social and economic \nconditions. For example literacy rate is higher for higher income group than the lower income group. Services of health \nfacilities are available to the higher and middle-income group than the lower income group and the poor. That the poor \nlack access to basic social services is not always due to lack of established social service facilities, but often because \nof the service provider attitudes toward them. Interviews with the poor people indicate that they are often discriminated \nand neglected by the service providers. For example, sometimes the health service provider of the government health \nfacility does not attend the poor patient and if the poor get attended by the doctor, they do not get adequate or proper \ntreatment and medicine.    \n \nIlliteracy is also positively correlated with poverty. The poverty levels are higher in households where the head of the \nhousehold is illiterate. Literacy ratio and per pupil expenditure of primary and secondary education is substantially \nhigher in urban areas than rural areas and among households in the highest income quintile compared to households \nin the lowest income quintile. Gross enrollment rates (GERs) at primary level in Punjab are 69% for females and 84% \nfor males and net primary enrollment rates (NERs) are 43% for females and 47% for males. Primary level GERs \namong the first income quintile are 44% for females and 61% for males, while in the fifth quintile they are 97% and \n117%, respectively. Literacy rates for population 10 years and above are 36% for females and 57% for males. GERs \nat middle level are 43% for females and 46% for males. At secondary level, GERs are 34% for females and 55% for \nmales. Dropout rates of children 15\u201319 years were much higher among girls (33%) than boys (24.45%). \n \nThe social sector indicators are generally poor compared to countries with similar per capita income. The total fertility \nrate is currently 4.8 and contraceptive prevalence rate is estimated at 27.6%. The maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 \nlive births is in the range of 500. Nearly 11% of children die before reaching their fifth birthday. Among those who \nsurvive, one quarter do not go to school. Currently there are about 4 million malnourished children in Punjab, and \nabout a third of all pregnant women are estimated to have iron deficiency anemia. Over 35% of children under the age \nof 5 years are short for their age; over 10% are under weight for their age and over half are anemic.  \n \nDuring the 1990s, the government of Punjab implemented Social Action Program (SAP) to improve delivery and \ngovernance of social services. The SAP results are mixed. A combination of factors such as weak planning, \nimplementation strategies, lack of social mobilization activities, planning at the community level, lack of transparent \nprocess in financing and management etc. influenced the outcome of the SAP and did not bring the desired results. In \naddition to the SAP, other social sector and poverty programs brought limited impact on poverty reduction and in \nproviding access to social services to the poor and women. Limited success of social service delivery is due to several \nfactors. Following observations are made during the field visits to Guzrat and Mandi Bahauddin: (i) lack of clarity on \nrole and responsibilities of the officials from different line agencies and the different tier of the local government under \nPLGO 2001; (ii) intergovernment relationships are not fully realized and practiced by the officials as described under \ndifferent notifications; (iii) in equitable and inefficient management and resource allocation for district, tehsil, and union \ncouncil level; (iv) schools and health facilities are without teachers, doctors, and paramedics; (v) absenteeism of \nservice providers in the assigned duty station; and (vi) service facilities are not aligned to provide services to the poor \nand the women.  \n \nThe  proposed  PDSSP  plans  to  contribute  to  these  objectives  by  introducing  rational  policy  reforms,  building \ninstitutional and human resource capacity of social service agencies, quality of social services, and flexible financing \nfor the devolved social services. The specific interventions include: (i) development of operational manuals for service \nagencies for better planning; (ii) capacity building of the officials of the service agencies, local government and the \nelected representatives of the union councils and nazims of the three tiers of local government; (iii) use of citizen \ncharters, display of development funds, development projects/programs for citizens review and suggestion, in the \ndistrict council, tehsil, union council, and  social service facility boards; (iv) awareness raising activities for the service \nproviders to develop pro-poor and pro-gender social service delivery mechanism; and (v) improving public-private \npartnership mechanisms for developing innovative projects on  social  services  for  the  local  communities,  including \nwomen and the poor. An important intervention under the PDSSP is to target poor and vulnerable population groups \nby designing pro-poor services, especially for the rural population and the deprived districts. ", "Appendix 12  69\nC.        Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nStakeholder Analysis. A cross-section of the stakeholders was invited in five regional workshops in three regions of \nthe province i.e., south, north, and center. The stakeholders included elected representatives from various tiers of \nlocal government, government officials from provincial and local government departments, and some nongovernment \norganization (NGO) representatives. Meetings were held with civil society organizations (CSOs), NGOs/ community-\ncitizen boards (CCBs), and elected representatives of the local government to identify issues related to weak service \ndelivery and strategies to improve delivery of services. The potential for involvement of CSOs, NGOs, CCBs, and \ncommunity-based organizations (CBOs) were identified. It is revealed from the discussions that on occasions where a \nCSO, such as the Patient Welfare Association, is involved in improving the health services in hospitals, the services \nhave improved significantly. Similarly, where elected woman representative is involved in a school management \ncommittee (SMC), the performance of the school has improved.  \n \nThe PDSSP will include interventions through public-private partnerships to involve CSOs, CBOS, NGOs, and \nthe elected representatives of the union council to develop or improve community-level social services. The \nspecific  interventions  comprise:  (i)  strengthening skills of the members of the local government\u2019s monitoring \ncommittees at all levels to enable them to perform their mandated role through development of monitoring guidelines \nand tools; (ii) strengthening the role of the CSOs, CBOs, CCBs, and NGOs in developing an efficient health \nservice delivery system at the local level; (iii) developing linkages between the social service agencies and CSOs, \nCBOs, CCBs, and NGOs for pro-poor service delivery; and (iv) introducing a participatory monitoring system for \nassessment of the performance of the service delivery system and of the service providers.  \n \nThe display of development funds and schemes on social services for public information at the district council, tehsil \nmunicipal administration, and union council level would enhance awareness among local communities about social \nsector service availability. The public disclosure of development funds and schemes would facilitate community \ninvolvement in monitoring of social services. \n   \nThe PDSSP will coordinate its work on water and sanitation with the two ADB-funded water and sanitation projects \nthat have developed participatory strategy such as (i) establishing community level committees to undertake the \nconstruction of lane level sewers; (ii) participation of committees in planning activities in their respective localities; \nand (iii) formation of community level committees in respective wards and neighborhood to conduct awareness \ncampaigns for solid waste management. With regard to services on education sector, PDSSP will collaborate with \nthe International Development Association funded Punjab Education Sector Reforms Program (PESRP) which has \nbuilt in participatory planning for making school councils/SMCs efficient. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                    Yes                   No          \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThere is little evidence of narrowing down of gender gaps among various socioeconomic status in the province of \nPunjab. Women do not have adequate access to health, literacy and education services. According to Pakistan \nIntegrated Household Survey (PIHS) only 10% women in Punjab received postpartum care, 15% in urban areas and \n8% in rural areas. They are given a limited role in decision-making in the public sphere. Improvement is insignificant in \npolicy formulation, monitoring of policy implementation, and participating in conceptualizing development programs, \nespecially at local level. Women\u2019s share in employment opportunities is far below their share in population. Pakistan \nranks 129th out of 146 countries on the gender-related development index and 92nd in gender empowerment measures \nout of 94 countries. Women are subjected to discriminatory laws, violence, and lack of employment opportunities. \nAccountability of public sector entities on gender equity is negligible. \n \nMaternal mortality is high in the range 350 per 100,000 live births. The antenatal coverage is extremely low. Only 21% \nof deliveries at national level took place in health institutions during 2000/01. About a third of all pregnant women are \nanemic. About one third of girls never enroll in primary school compared with one quarter of boys.
