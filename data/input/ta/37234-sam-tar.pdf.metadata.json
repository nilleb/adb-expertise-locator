Samoa\u2019s Statement of Development Strategy (SDS) 2005\u20132007 focuses on enhancing \npeople\u2019s opportunities and choices with a vision of improved quality of life for all. Four of the six \nSDS goals relate to economic development: (i) increased investment to create employment \nopportunities, (ii) accelerated agricultural growth, (iii) increased tourism development within a \nbalanced and sustainable framework, and (iv) increased economic and social opportunities for \ncommunities. \"Land for development\" is a specific SDS objective toward the goal of increased \ninvestment to create employment opportunities. Within this objective, promoting the economic \nuse of customary land is a key SDS activity. Improving the business environment and enabling \nprivate  sector  development  have  been  specific  priorities  of  the  Government  of  Samoa \nthroughout its decade-long reform process, with active support from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). ADB\u2019s current program in Samoa1 focuses on the twin objectives of (i) improving \nthe environment for the private sector, and (ii) ensuring access to, and quality of, basic social \nservices. \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) on Promoting Economic Use of Customary Land2 was \nagreed upon by ADB and the Government during programming discussions in 2003 and was \nlisted in the Samoa Country Strategy and Program Update 2004\u20132006.3 It follows on from \nimportant exploratory work on this issue supported by ADB Loan 1785-SAM: Small Business \nDevelopment,4 and the associated TA 3549-SAM: Capacity Building of Financial and Business \nAdvisory Services.5 Component 4 of the loan, which aims to \"Improve the policy and Iegislative \nenvironment for small business development\", includes study of the issues relating to economic \nuse of customary land. The loan has helped establish and support a working group on economic \nuse of customary land (WG), with Government, private sector, and community representation. \nThe WG will report to the Samoan Cabinet on a proposed work program to promote economic \nuse  of  customary  land.  The  WG  report  will  follow  extensive  community  consultations  in \nNovember  2005.  The  work  program  will  commence  in  2006.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework of the TA is attached in Appendix 1. \n \n3.  An ADB fact-finding mission6 visited Samoa from 9 to 13 May 2005 for discussions with \nthe Government, lawyers, the private sector, and community representatives on the proposed \nTA. The mission attended and addressed a WG meeting. Further discussions in Samoa on 3 \nNovember 2005 updated ADB\u2019s understanding of expected WG recommendations. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Customary land is controlled and used according to traditional Samoan custom. It has \nnever been alienated through a formal government land tenure system. A key feature of the \ncustomary arrangement is that the person currently using the land only continues to use the \nland  with  permission  from  the  titleholder\u2014a  chief  (or  matai)  whose  Samoan  title  carries \n                                                 \n1  Set out in ADB. 2004.

It was conducted in parallel with an ADB review mission for Loan 1785-SAM: Small Business Development \nand associated TA 3549-SAM: Capacity Building of Financial and Business Advisory Services. \n ", "2   \naccompanying land stewardship responsibilities. The traditional rules related to control and \nusage of customary land remain fundamental to Samoan society. Customary land comprises \n565,000 acres, or 81%, of the area of Samoa7 and includes much of the land with potential for \ntourism or more intensive agriculture development (e.g., tree crops and livestock). \n \n5.  Tourism, in particular, is the subject of considerable optimism in Samoa as a source of \npotential jobs and economic growth. Other possible economic uses for leased customary land \ninclude manufacturing, retail outlets, and possibly to support investment in improved residential \ndwellings.  There  are  currently  197  active  leases  on  customary  land,  of  which  32  are  for \ncommercial purposes.8   \n \n6.  There is a general\u2014and based on case studies undertaken by the WG, well-founded\u2014\nperception among potential investors in Samoa that gaining secure rights over customary land \nto invest in productive activity is difficult and time-consuming.9 Legal provision for granting \nleases on customary land is made in the Alienation of Customary Land Act 1965 (the Act). The \nAct provides a workable, if time-consuming, model for establishing leasehold title and provides \nfor the mortgaging of leases on customary land (but not the mortgaging of the land itself).10 \nHowever, a number of practical problems impede efficient operation of the Act. Administrative \nprocesses for establishing leases are not clear to applicants, resulting in confusion and delays. \nA proliferation in the awarding of chief (matai) titles to land in Samoa, and frequent long-term \noverseas absences by many Samoan title-holders, further confuse matters. These problems \nhave been exacerbated in recent times by delays in the disposition of disputes by the Land and \nTitles Court. The Act's provisions on the mortgaging of leases are widely misunderstood or \nunknown.  However,  perhaps  the  greatest  constraint  facing  the  WG  is  a  lack  of  public \ninformation  on  the  practical  workings  of  leasehold  arrangements  and  the  issues  that  both \nlandowners and investors should consider and discuss before entering into an agreement. \nConsequently, there is a general perception that traditional landowners will not respect the rule \nof law if disputes arise. \n \n7.  The WG has formed the view, based on its assessments to date, that while the current \nlegal framework may need minor adjustments, implementation of the current arrangements and \nbetter information for stakeholders on how these arrangements operate are the main challenges, \nat least for the short term. Therefore, the proposed approach of the WG focuses on improving \nand streamlining current provisions of the Act for establishing leasehold on customary land. \nOptions for allowing investment on customary land without requiring a formal lease have been \nexamined and found to be of limited value, while the creation of freehold title on customary land \nis forbidden by Samoa\u2019s Constitution. The WG has concluded that the most productive way \nforward is to make it easier to establish a formal lease and improve confidence that all parties \nwill adhere to lease provisions. \n \n8.  The  difficulty  of  obtaining  financing  using  a  lease  as  collateral  is  clearly  a  major \nconstraint for investors. However, the approach being promoted by the WG is not prescriptive \n                                                 \n7 The remainder is either private freehold land, covering 57,400 acres, or 8% of Samoa's total land; or public (i.e., \ngovernment) land, covering 77,100 acres, or 11% of total land. \n8  Others are for government use of customary land (telecommunications, water, and power installations\u201480 leases) \nand churches (85 leases). Data are from the land registry, Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and \nMeteorology. \n9  We are not aware of any data on actual times and processes involved in registering leases on customary land.  \nHowever, case studies recently undertaken by the WG and the current experience of an international hotel \ndeveloper clearly point to a lengthy, unwieldy process.  \n10  The TA consultant and WG have identified two such mortgages in practice.   \n ", "  3\ntoward the role of commercial banks and financial institutions. It recognizes that banks make \njudgments based on risk assessment and should continue to do so. However, it is anticipated \nthat clarification of the legal provisions of the Act, improved Government administration, and, \nmost importantly, better informed land owners and investors will contribute to a more positive \nenvironment for assessing the risk of individual projects. Importantly, reforms to create an \nenvironment for secured transactions using chattels (i.e., movable assets), and establishment of \na  credit  bureau  being  supported  under  TA  3549-SAM:  Capacity  Building  of  Financial  and \nBusiness Advisory Services (footnote 5), will contribute to creating a menu of activities that will \nincrease access to credit in Samoa. The WG is consulting with commercial banks as it develops \nits recommendations. \n \n9.  The TA will complement current work at the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment \nand Meteorology (MNREM) on land administration and survey. This work is being supported \nthrough IDA loan 3193-WSO \"Infrastructure Asset Management Project\". The Project is (i) \nimproving the accuracy of geographic information under the Samoa Integrated Grid, and (ii) \nstrengthening systems for freehold and public land administration and registration, including an \nimproved, computerized land register. Consistent with the scope of current ADB loan and TA \nactivities, it was agreed that the TA will confine itself to issues related to customary land, while \nthe World Bank project focuses on freehold and public land administration. \n \n10.  The  Government  of  Samoa  has  shown  clear  commitment  at  the  highest  levels  to \naddressing the perceived and actual problems that make it difficult to attract investment onto \ncustomary land. This is a high priority issue for the Prime Minister, who recently took the \ninitiative of appearing on a television program specifically to discuss and promote the proposed \nreforms. The WG has organized a series of five such TV discussions, to take place prior to the \ncommencement  of  an  extensive  public  consultation  process  on  the  issue.  Meetings  with \npracticing lawyers, the private sector, and community representatives also led the fact-finding \nmission to conclude that commitment to addressing this sensitive and much-debated issue is \nwidespread,  so  long  as  the  approach  taken  is  practical,  pragmatic,  and  within  Samoan \nConstitutional  provisions  barring  the  alienation  for  freehold  of  customary  land.  Given  the \nsensitivity of land-related issues in all Pacific countries, there is some risk that the work of the \nWG and/or this TA may be misunderstood or misrepresented, especially during the pre-election \nperiod  for  Samoa  (elections  are  scheduled  for  March  2006).  However,  this  risk  is  being \neffectively managed at present. \n \n11.  The ADB fact-finding mission, along with a parallel review mission for the current ADB \nloan and TA, assessed the WG process as highly appropriate and assessed the quality of the \nwork done to date as high. The WG is likely to present an excellent report to the Cabinet for \nconsideration. The mission recommended the addition of a draft action plan to the final WG \nreport in order to promote a smooth transition to the implementation phase. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The intended impact of the TA is to increase levels of economic activity (investment and \nproduction) on customary land. The outcome of the TA will be to increase the efficiency and \neffectiveness  with  which  landowners  and  investors  (domestic  and  foreign)  implement \nagreements to utilize customary land for economic purposes. Subject to the Cabinet\u2019s decision \non the WG report, specific TA outputs will be: \n \n ", "4   \n(i)  amendments to the Alienation of Customary Land Act 1965 to further promote \nappropriate economic use of customary land;  \n(ii)  streamlined administrative processes for entering into leases on customary land; \n(iii)  public  information  materials  disseminated,  and  public  education  processes \nconducted, on key issues and processes for landowners and potential investors; \n(iv)  improved registration, mapping, and availability of information on customary land \ntitles and boundaries; and \n(v)  based  on  findings  from  the  above  activities,  implementation  of  a  review  of \ninstitutional arrangements for appropriate Government involvement in matters \nrelated to economic use of customary land. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The fact-finding mission and the Government agreed that the role of the TA should be to \nassist  the  Government  to  implement  Cabinet  decisions  on  the  WG  report.  Therefore,  the \ninception mission should, jointly with the Government, take stock of the action plan in order to \nreflect Cabinet guidance. The ADB TA will support the reforms with short-term inputs of valuable \nexpertise, knowledge, and resources to manage a complex, one-off reform process that will \nrequire careful management and coordination. \n \n14.  Inter-agency coordination is vital to a successful outcome. Two agencies have direct \nresponsibility for decisions regarding leases on customary land: MNREM, which registers and \nadministers land titles, including leases on customary land, and the Land and Titles Court, \nwhich  determines  ownership  of  customary  land  and  adjudicates  disputes.  In  addition, \ngovernment agencies such as the Ministry of Finance (as lead agency for government economic \nreforms), Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Labor, and the Attorney General have a strong \ninterest in the successful outcome of the proposed reforms. Continued involvement of private \nsector  and  community  representatives  will  also  be  vital  to  ensuring  a  balanced,  widely \nsupported reform process. \n \n15.  The activities of the TA will fall into three broad categories: (i) legal, administrative, and \ntechnical reforms within the Government; (ii) public information and education; and (iii) reform \ncoordination.  The  reforms  within  the  Government  are  expected  to  include  streamlining  of \nadministrative processes within MNREM and the Land and Titles Court, and the creation of a \ncentral, accessible electronic database of leases on customary land. A specific opportunity for \nthe TA is to better document the judgments of the Land and Titles Court and make them more \nwidely available, by registering them in the land register being developed by the World Bank \nproject. Where formal surveys of customary land have been submitted to the court, they can be \nmapped on a geographic information system operated by MNREM. \n \n16.  Public information and education is seen by many in Samoa as the most important \nelement of this reform in terms of (i) clarifying important legal and economic concepts (e.g., the \ndifference between mortgaging a lease and mortgaging land); (ii) setting out for landowners and \ninvestors important issues to consider before entering into agreements; and (iii) explaining the \nadministrative processes and likely timeline for entering into leases. Public information and \neducation are expected to be important not only in raising public awareness of opportunities to \n ", "  5\npromote investment, but also in reducing the likelihood of subsequent disputes over the terms \nand conditions of agreed leases.11\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $360,000 equivalent, comprising $97,500 in \nforeign exchange and $262,500 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $300,000 equivalent, to meet the entire foreign exchange cost of $97,500 and \n$202,500 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nbalance of the local currency cost of $60,000 equivalent by providing salaries for counterpart \nstaff in the Executing Agency and WG, along with office space, materials, and support at the \nExecuting Agency. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Executing Agency \nwill convene a working group of relevant government and non-government stakeholders to \nguide TA implementation. The TA will be implemented over 24 months, commencing between \nApril and June 2006, and ending by June 2008. TA inception will follow advice to ADB from the \nGovernment on decisions taken by Samoa\u2019s Cabinet regarding WG recommendations, and \nconfirmation that appropriate institutional arrangements are in place. \n  \n19.  ADB will engage international and domestic consultants through a firm using a quality-\nand-cost-based selection method, after seeking simplified technical proposals. The consultants \nwill  be  engaged  according  to  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. Central to \nthe consulting inputs will be a long-term (24 person-months) domestic consultant position, \nworking with the Executing Agency and supporting the agreed coordination process to ensure \nfull implementation and careful monitoring of the action plan. The long-term domestic consultant \ninput will be supplemented by short-term domestic and international consultants, information \nmaterials,  training,  and  information  technology  (IT)  hardware  and  software.  The  long-term \ndomestic consultant will be mobilized first, and will assist with the confirmation of further TA \ninputs.  Equipment purchased for the TA will become the property of the Samoan Government \nagency with functional responsibility for the task being supported by the equipment.  \n \n20.  The  consulting  firm  will  provide  brief  reports  on  the  contribution  of  all  short-term \nconsultants to the TA. The firm will also provide an inception report, mid-term report, draft final \nreport, final report, and brief quarterly progress reports. The outline of the consultants\u2019 terms of \nreference is in Appendix 3.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Samoa for Promoting Economic Use of Customary Land, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                 \n11  The TA will be in the fortunate position of building on the good work in public information and education being \ncarried out in 2005 by the current working group. This includes a series of five televised discussions on key issues, \nand extensive public consultation, including consultation in rural areas, as part of the report formulation process. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets /  Data Sources /  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators  Reporting \nMechanisms \nImpact       \nIncreased levels of economic  1.
