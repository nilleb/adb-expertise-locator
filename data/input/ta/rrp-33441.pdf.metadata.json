It will\naddress  acid  rain  and  air  pollution  problems  in  the  part  of  the\nYangtze River Valley that lies within Anhui Province. In 2000, the\ntotal  population  of  the  project  area  was  about  17  million.  The\nProject will support policy reforms and institutional strengthening\nrequired to control acid rain and improve the environment. The\ninvestments will (i) promote cleaner production, energy efficiency,\nand  waste  minimization  in  six  industrial  enterprises;  (ii)  include\nthree  environmental  improvement  and  acid  rain  damage\nrehabilitation subprojects in two ecologically protected areas; and\n(iii)  strengthen  environmental  management  in  institutions  and\nmonitoring agencies in the project area and subproject enterprises.\nClassification Thematic: Environmental protection\nEnvironmental\n    Assessment Category B. Sensitive. The summary initial environmental\nexamination was circulated to the Board on 1 August 2001.\nRationale The Project is designed to reduce acid rain in Anhui, a relatively\npoor province with a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) at\n72 percent of the national average. The air quality in the Yangtze\nRiver  Valley  has  deteriorated  considerably  to  harmful  levels.\nWithout intervention, air quality will further deteriorate and acid\nrain frequency will increase, with serious negative implications for\npublic health and economic development. The Anhui provincial\ngovernment (APG) is implementing an acid rain control plan to\naddress these concerns. APG has demonstrated a strong sense\nof  ownership  of  the  Project  by  identifying  subprojects  with\nadequate provision for local currency financing.\nThe Project will reduce the overall exposure to air pollution and\nacid rain of people living and working in the project area, resulting\nin substantial health benefits. Reduced acid rain will also improve\nagricultural and forestry productivity, improve water quality, reduce\nmaterial  damage,  and  enhance  environmental  quality  while\nensuring sustainability of ecologically unique protected areas.\nThe Project is an integral part of the provincial acid rain control\nstrategy, and is consistent with the Government\u2019s strategy to clean\nup the environment by improving air and water quality in the acid\nrain control zone of the PRC. The Project is consistent with the\nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) strategy to support measures\nfor environmental improvement and natural resource management\nin  the  PRC.  It  will  be  the  eighth  environmental  improvement\nproject  supported  by  ADB,  and  the  first  to  focus  on  acid  rain\ncontrol.  The  Project  will  also  be  the  first  environmental\nimprovement project to focus solely on secondary cities.", "iii\nObjective and Scope The objective of the Project is to control acid rain and improve the\nenvironment in the Yangtze River Valley in Anhui Province. The\nProject will promote cleaner production, reduce waste, improve\nenergy efficiency, enhance environmental quality, and strengthen\ninstitutions for environmental management.\nThe  Project  has  three  main  components:  (i)  six  subprojects\npromoting  cleaner  production  (CP)  undertaken  by  industrial\nenterprises; (ii) three environmental improvement and acid rain\ndamage  rehabilitation  (EI-ARD)  subprojects  in  two  ecologically\nprotected areas; and (iii) institutional strengthening of provincial\nand  local  environmental  agencies,  and  subproject  enterprises.\nThe six CP subprojects will entail investments to reduce SO  and\n2\nother gases causing acid rain through CP, and will reduce waste,\nadvance technology, and improve energy efficiency. The three EI-\nARD  subprojects  will  improve  environmental  management  and\nrehabilitate acid rain damage in ecologically rich protected areas\nat Huangshan and Jiuhua mountains. Institutional strengthening\nwill focus on improving the policy framework for reducing SO  and\n2\nother gases causing acid rain, and human resource development\nfor  implementing  measures  and  improving  environmental\nmanagement and monitoring.\nCost Estimates The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $325  million  equivalent,\ncomprising a foreign exchange cost of $147 million (45 percent)\nand a local currency cost of $178 million equivalent (55 percent).\nFinancing Plan ADB will provide a loan of $147 million to finance the entire foreign\nexchange cost of the Project. The local currency financing of $178\nmillion equivalent will be arranged through domestic borrowing\n($69.2  million  equivalent),  enterprise  contribution  ($98.2  million\nequivalent),  and  budgetary  allocation  from  provincial  and\nmunicipality governments ($10.6 million equivalent).\nLoan Amount and\nTerms A loan of $147 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be\nprovided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan will\nhave a 20-year term, including a grace period of 4 years; an interest\nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending\nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum; and a\nfront-end  fee  of  1.0  percent.  The  Borrower  will  make  the  loan\nproceeds available to APG for relending to subproject enterprises\nthrough subsidiary loan agreements, with the same terms and\nconditions  as  for  EI-ARD  subproject  enterprises,  and  with  an\namortization period of 14 years including a 4-year grace period for\nCP subproject enterprises. Relending terms for the institutional\nstrengthening  component  will  be  similar  to  the  respective\nsubproject  enterprises\u2019  terms.    Lending  terms  for  APG\u2019s\ninstitutional strengthening component will be similar to the loan\nrepayment. The foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks\nwill be borne by the subproject enterprises.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2006", "iv\nExecuting Agency APG will be the Executing Agency, supervising overall subproject\nimplementation and coordinating policy and institutional measures\nto  support  the  Project.  Each  subproject  enterprise  will  be  the\nImplementing Agency for its respective component.\nImplementation\nArrangement Project  implementation  will  begin  in  January  2002.  APG  has\nestablished  a  project  management  office  and  each  subproject\nenterprise has established a project implementation office.\nProcurement The equipment, materials, and services financed from the proceeds\nof the ADB loan will be procured through international competitive\nbidding or international shopping (IS) in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Each  contract  for  equipment  or\nmaterials estimated to cost equivalent of $500,000 or more will be\nawarded  through  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.\nEach  equipment  and  materials  contract  valued  at  less  than\n$500,000  will  be  awarded  using  IS  procedures.  Civil  works\ncontracts  will  be  carried  out  under  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The enterprises will procure items\nfinanced  with  local  currency  funds  following  the  Borrower\u2019s\nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB.\nConsulting Services Domestic  consultants  financed  by  the  enterprises  have  been\nengaged to (i) prepare basic and detailed engineering; (ii) prepare\nbasic  specifications  of  equipment  and  materials  and  tender\ndocuments;  and  (iii)  assist  the  enterprises  in  supervising\nconstruction,  installation,  and  commissioning.  International\nconsulting services for 40  person-months and domestic consulting\nservices  for  40  person-months  will  be  required  for  institutional\nstrengthening and project implementation. Consultants will provide\ntraining  and  capacity  building  in  environmental  monitoring  and\nmanagement,  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision,  and\nproject and financial management. Consultants will be engaged in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic\nconsultants.\nEstimated Project\n     Completion Date 31 December 2005\nProject Benefits and\nBeneficiaries The Project will play a key role in implementing APG\u2019s acid rain\ncontrol and environmental protection program by promoting cost-\neffective and self-financing air pollution control investments. The\nProject will promote CP, reduce waste, improve energy efficiency,\nand thereby reduce air pollution and control acid rain. It will reduce\nSO  emission by 31,300 tons/year and acid rain frequency by 50\n2\npercent in Guichi, Huangshan, Tongling, and Wuhu. Improving the\nenvironment  and  rehabilitating  acid  rain  damage  in  ecologically\nprotected areas will result in significant environmental benefits from\nthe Project at the local, national, and global levels. The estimated\ncarbon dioxide reduction through the Project is about 476,800 tons", "v\nper year. The subprojects are financially sound and economically\nviable, with financial internal rates of return of 6.3-13.6  percent for\nCP subprojects and 7.3-10.0 percent for EI-ARD subprojects. The\neconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for CP subprojects are\n14.2-27.5 percent; those for EI-ARD are 19.7-23.9 percent. Overall,\nthe EIRR for the whole Project investment is 20.4 percent. Risk\nanalysis shows that the probability of EIRR falling lower than 12\npercent is almost zero.\nReduced acid rain is a project output that will benefit both the rich\nand the poor alike. The Project will have significant social benefits\nand contribute to poverty reduction through improved health, better\nworking  conditions  for  enterprise  workers,  provision  of  clean\ndrinking water for rural residents; enhanced agriculture and forestry\nproductivity;  and  creation  of  direct,  indirect,  and  temporary\nemployment.", "iv", "iiv", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Acid Rain Control and Environmental\nImprovement Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. Air pollution, including acid rain, remains the most serious environmental problem in the\nPRC. Industrial production and power generation are the two main sources of air pollution. The\neffects of air pollution on people include various types of respiratory and heart diseases that\nprimarily affect children, the elderly, and other disadvantaged groups, with the poor suffering the\nmost. Among the negative impacts of acid rain are deterioration of human health, reduction of\nagricultural and forestry production, poor water quality, destruction of biologically important\necosystems, and damage to cultural and historical structures. The Government has formulated\na comprehensive plan to overcome environmental degradation and urban pollution associated\nwith  the  acid  rain  problem.  The  plan  targets  the  urban  industry,  energy  production,  and\nresidential sectors that currently use coal as the dominant energy source and are therefore\nresponsible for much of the air pollution. The deterioration of environmental quality due to acid\nrain is particularly acute in the Yangtze River Valley within Anhui Province which is a poor inland\nprovince in the central part of the PRC. Benefits from reduced acid rain are nonexcludable in\ncharacter and will accrue to all people living in the project area.\n3. In June 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance1 (TA) to\nexplore  the  need  for  policy  and  institutional  reforms  to  control  acid  rain  and  improve  the\nenvironment in the Yangtze River Valley in Anhui Province (Map 1). Project preparation studies\nwere completed in April 2001 and an ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in April 2001. A\nConsultation Mission visited the PRC in May 2001 to review enterprise restructuring status,\ninstitutional strengthening, and the viability of enterprises for the proposed investments. At the\nrequest of the Government, an Appraisal Mission visited the PRC in July 2001 to further\nevaluate  the  Project  and  to  hold  policy  dialogue.2  The  linkages  of  policies,  institutional\nframework, physical investments, and objectives of the Project are described in the project\nframework (Appendix 1). The Project\u2019s thematic classification is environmental protection.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA.  Environment Sector\n4. Acid rain can be a local as well as a transboundary problem occurring as far as 1,000\nkilometers (km) from the pollution source. It can result in acidification of soil and water and\nreduce forests\u2019 vulnerability to fire. Soil acidification damages agriculture and forestry, and\nincreased  acidity  adversely  affects  the  ecology  in  water  bodies.  Such  damages  were  first\nreported in northern Europe and North America in the 1960s and 1970s. Forest damage in\n                  \n1 TA. 3462-PRC: Acid Rain Control and Environmental Improvement Project, for $964,000, approved on 27 June\n2000.\n2 The Mission comprised P. Abeygunawardena, Senior Economist for Environment, Mission Leader; C.S. Chin,\nSenior Portfolio Management Specialist; X. Ma, Economist (Environment); N.T. Anvaripour, Financial Management\nSpecialist; O. Tiwana, Counsel; A. Hirano, Energy Specialist (Financial) ; and N. Sakata, Intern. The Mission was\nassisted by A. Huq, Senior Project Engineer  from ADB Headquarters.", "2\nnorthern Europe was caused mainly by sulfur dioxide (SO ) emission from the United Kingdom\n2\nand  East  Germany.3  Similarly,  SO   emissions  from  the  United  States  caused  damage  in\n2\nCanada. Acid rain is also emerging as a major concern in Asia. However, most Asian countries\nhave not taken adequate control measures.\n5. Over the past two decades, the PRC has made major progress in moving from a\nplanned system to a market-based economy. As with other aspects of economic and social\ndevelopment,  there  have  been  substantial  changes  in  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  agenda.\nRegulatory  and  institutional  capacities  have  been  strengthened,  policies  supporting  energy\nefficiency and clean energy have been adopted, and increased information dissemination has\nimproved environmental awareness. From 1990 to 2000, PRC\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP)\ngrew by about 9.2 percent annually. One of the costs of the country\u2019s rapid economic expansion\nis a worsening of environmental quality, including increased levels of acid rain. According to the\nState Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA), acid rain currently falls over 30 percent\nof the nation\u2019s territory or 2.87 million km2 (Map 2). The economy\u2019s continued reliance on coal\nsuggests that efforts to mitigate acid deposition causing emissions should be intensified to cope\nwith the projected increase in the demand for energy.\n6. It is estimated that the PRC generates about 90 percent of all SO  emission in East\n2\nAsia.4  In  2000,  about  20  million  tons  of  SO   was  discharged  from  PRC  sources  into  the\n2\natmosphere. SO  from coal burning is the major cause of acid rain.5 The combustion of coal for\n2\nindustrial purposes, energy production, and residential and commercial applications is the major\nreason for emission of gases causing acid rain.6 About 40 percent of total SO  emissions come\n2\nfrom industrial sources, 41 percent from power generation, and 19 percent from residential and\ncommercial sources. The adverse impacts of acid rain are serious and reducing acid rain needs\nurgent attention. Nationwide, the annual economic losses caused by outdoor air pollution was\nestimated at $41 billion (based on 1995 data), of which $14 billion was attributed to acid rain\n(about 2 percent of GDP). Selection of a strategy for acid rain control should favor options\noffering the biggest difference between marginal benefits and marginal control costs. Large\ninvestments, together with a more stringent regulatory and monitoring framework, are required\nto address PRC\u2019s acid rain problem. In this regard,  the Tenth Five Year Plan (10FYP) has\nemphasized  the  need  for  allocating  1.3  percent  of  GDP  for  environmental  improvement,\nprimarily for pollution control (see para 18).\n7. Economic and social indicators place Anhui in the bottom third of PRC\u2019s provinces\ndespite the high economic growth achieved from the 1980s to the late 1990s. This growth was\nachieved by developing a large number of heavy industries, most of which utilize outdated and\ninefficient technology and equipment. Rapid urbanization and increases in motor vehicles have\nalso contributed to the worsening air quality in cities. All these have resulted in high levels of air\nemissions, wastewater, and solid waste, causing high levels of pollution and acid rain.  The\nproblems are exacerbated by nonuse of market-based instruments (MBIs) to provide financial\n                  \n3 Twenty-one European nations met in 1985 to discuss measures to prevent acid rain damage, and agreements\nreached are recorded in the Helsinki Protocol. Further, Canada and the United States agreed in 1991 to take\nmutual responsibility for establishing common goals for reducing gas emissions that caused acid rain.\n4 Considering the continental wind stream, SO  generated in the PRC affects neighboring countries like Japan and\n2\nthe Republic of Korea. According to the Japanese Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, more than\n20 percent of total sulfur compounds in Japan is  traced to sources in the PRC. More than 40 percent of SO in\n2\nFukuoka is estimated to originate in PRC sources.\n5  In the PRC, the effective contribution of SO  and NO to acid rain is estimated at 85 and 15 percent, respectively.\n2 x\n6  SO  emission and consequent acid rain generated by industries have more localized impacts than that associated\n2\nwith power generation. Power generation uses more pollution control devices, lower-sulfur coal, and taller stacks\nthat result in more diffused impacts.", "3\nincentives for environment-friendly behavior, and lack of pollution control equipment and other\nmeasures to reduce or eliminate small sources of air pollution.\n8. The portion of the Yangtze River Valley7 located in southern Anhui Province is subject to\nheavy  environmental  pollution  (Map  1).  The  ambient  levels  of  air  pollution  in  the  area,\nparticularly SO2 and total suspended particulate (TSP) levels, increased from the early 1980s\nthrough the mid-1990s. Energy consumption, which is anticipated to grow at 3 percent per year,\nwill result in significant increases in air pollution loads by the year 2010 if effective measures to\nmeet the problem are not implemented. The project area has a population of over 17 million,\nwith 80 percent classified as rural residents, and covers about 25 percent of the total land area\nof the province. Although agriculture has experienced robust growth (7 percent per annum in\n1991-1999), the industry sector has been growing more rapidly (19.3 percent per annum). About\n102,000 urban residents and 408,000 rural residents in the project area have per capita annual\nincomes  of  less  than  Y3,000  and  Y1,000,  respectively.  Environmental  degradation  has\nincreased the vulnerability of poor and low-income households in the project area.\n1. Acid Rain Control\n9. Within Anhui, the Huai River and Chao Lake have received national attention due to\nenvironmental concerns. The Huai River, Chao Lake, and a portion of the acid rain control zone\nalong the Yangtze River Valley (in Anhui) are part of the national environmental protection\nprogram established in 1998. Due to its subtropical climate and geographic diversity, Anhui\nprovince is ecologically rich. The province also has a long-standing and strong cultural heritage.\nMotivated by those factors and serious environmental damage to the fragile ecosystems due to\nheavy industrial pollution, the province has pioneered in taking various initiatives to clean up the\nenvironment.8 The province also developed a well-thought-out acid rain control plan. In 1997,\nthe  State  Council  designated  five  prefectures  (Chaohu,  Tongling,  Wuhu,  Maanshan,  and\nXuanzhou) as the acid rain control zone of Anhui Province. The zone was extended to cover\necologically sensitive Huangshan in 1998 (Map 2). The State Council requires these prefectures\nto remedy damage caused by acid rain.\n10. During  9FYP  period  (1996-2000),  Anhui\u2019s  environment  objectives  were  to  (i) bring\nenvironmental pollution under control, (ii) improve the quality of the environment in major cities,\n(iii) reduce degradation of natural-ecological systems, and (iv) integrate environmental planning\nwith economic and social development efforts. To achieve these objectives, the Government\nstrengthened  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  effective  environmental\nmanagement.  The 10FYP (2001-2005) further promotes the objectives of sustainable economic\nand  social  development,  while  targeting  environmental  quality  improvements.    In  the\nenvironment sector the emphasis is on  (i) reducing the total pollution loads to achieve the\ndesignated  ambient  air  and  water  quality  standards,  (ii) continuing  environmental  quality\nimprovements in the cities, (iii) reversing the degradation of ecologically sensitive areas, and (iv)\ncontrolling and reducing environmental and ecological damage caused by acid rain.\n11. The average annual environment investment in Anhui was about $1.6 billion during the\n9FYP period, about 0.95 percent of the provincial GDP. In the 10FYP, a 20 percent reduction of\n                  \n7 It provides water for about 11 million residents; 492 major industrial enterprises, each with annual output values\nexceeding Y5 million; 1.8 million hectares of agricultural land; and an extensive fishing and aquaculture industry.\n8 ADB  assistance  for  the  cleanup  of  Chao  Lake  under  Loans  1490  and  1491-PRC:Anhui Environmental\nImprovement Project, for $112 million and $28 million, respectively, approved on 26 November 2996 has greatly\nsupported these efforts by reducing over half of wastewater discharged to Chao Lake through wastewater\ntreatment activities.", "4\nSO  from the 2000 level is mandated for the acid rain control zone. Studies financed by ADB\n2\nshow that acid rain damage in the area along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River are more\nserious than in other parts of the PRC.9 A centerpiece of the Anhui Province 10FYP is the SO\n2\nand Acid Rain Control Program, with emphasis on restricting the mining of high-sulfur coal,\nintroducing  clean  coal  technologies,  and  expanding  urban  gas  supply  and  district  heating\nsystems (Appendix 2).\n2.  Environmental Legislation and Regulations\n12. In the PRC, most environmental protection policies are implemented at the subnational\nlevel within the framework of national legislation, regulations, and standards.  The provincial and\nmunicipal governments, through their respective environment protection bureaus (EPBs), are\nresponsible for implementing national policies and are authorized to act in the absence of\nnational standards. Where warranted by local conditions, provincial EPBs may impose more\nstringent standards than those required by the national Government. In general, Anhui has\nadopted national standards for air, water, and solid waste management.\n13. With assistance from ADB and other aid agencies, the Government has issued a series\nof laws on the use of natural resources and has instituted a system of monitoring, recording,\nand reporting the discharge of pollutants.10 During the 1990s, the major laws on prevention and\ncontrol of air, water, and solid waste pollution were all updated.  The Air Pollution Prevention\nand Control Law was amended in 1995 and again in early 2000. The current law allows more\nflexibility in meeting air quality objectives, and has more definitive provisions for enforcement.\nSupported  by  the  2000  amendment  to  the  Air  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Law,  the\nGovernment, in its 10FYP will enforce a cap on SO emission levels. The cap is a necessary\n2 \nfirst step in applying MBIs for environmental management such as emission permit trading. With\nrespect to SO  and acid rain control, the law emphasizes a number of measures for improving\n2\ncoal  quality:  (i) new  high-sulfur  coal  mines  (1.5 percent  or  higher  sulfur)  must  install  coal\nwashing facilities; (ii) existing high-sulfur coal mines must install washing equipment within\ndesignated time limits; (iii) coal with sulfur content over 3 percent will neither be produced nor\nused; and (iv) in designated areas in important cities, highly polluting fuels, including high-sulfur\ncoal, are to be phased out.\n14. The Anhui Environment Protection Bureau (AEPB) was established in 1993 as an official\nagency  to  manage  environmental  matters  in  the  province.  Several  important  environment-\nrelated legislation and regulations have been passed.11 During the 1990s, provincial priorities\nwere in the water sector, with ADB loan and TA subprojects focusing on pollution problems in\nthe Huai River and Chao Lake basin.12  Beginning in the late 1990s, more attention was directed\nto  air  pollution  and  acid  rain  challenges.  Anhui  has  implemented  most  national  policies,\n                  \n9 TA 5528-REG: Acid Rain and Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction in Asia, for $450,000, approved on 16 April\n1993; and TA 5585-REG: Acid Rain and Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction in Asia Phase II, for $600,000,\napproved on 7 May 1997.\n10TA 2735-PRC: Capacity Building for Natural Resources Legislation, for $800,000, approved on 24 December 1996.\n11The environmental regulations include (i) Potable Water Source Protection of Dongpu Reservoir, Hefei City,\nDecember 1987; (ii) Chao Lake Water Resources Protection, January 1988; (iii) Technical Management of\nEnvironmental Protection Organizations in Anhui Province, November 1989; (iv) Fishery Act By-laws for Anhui\nProvince, August 1989; (v) Water Pollution Discharge Permits in Hefei City, October 1990; (vi) Sewage Discharge\nPermits in Hefei City, November 1990; (vii) Natural Forestry and Wildlife Protection Focus in Anhui Province, May\n1990; (viii) State Forestry Implementation Procedures in Anhui Province, October 1990; and (ix) Integrated\nStandards for Wastewater Discharge in Anhui Province, April 1993.\n12TA 2693-PRC: Formulation of an Integrated Management Plan for Chao Lake Basin, for $800,000, approved on 26\nNovember 1996. Loan 1490/91-PRC: Anhui Environmental Improvement Project (footnote 8).", "5\nlegislation, and standards related to air pollution control.13 Land use zoning in cities is used to\nregulate economic and industrial development through the city planning commissions. Cities in\nthe  project  area  are  required  to  relocate  heavy  industries  into  zones  designated  by  law.\nEmission permits are now used to regulate air emissions under the total emission control\npolicy.14\n3.  Standards and Incentives\n15. National standards have been developed for emissions and ambient concentrations of\npollutants. Ambient standards have been established for (i) air quality (three grades designated\nfor natural resource protection, urban, and industrial areas); (ii) environmental quality of surface\nwater; (iii) environmental noise in urban areas; (iv) fisheries water quality; and (v) marine water\nquality.  PRC standards are generally similar to international norms.  Emissions standards have\nalso been established for industrial waste gases (e.g., SO , NO , TSP, and carbon monoxide),\n2 X\nwastewater, and solid waste.  These standards are updated periodically in response to health,\ntechnological, and legal developments. ADB has provided assistance for formulating, refining,\nand improving environmental standards and enforcement policies.15\n16. Anhui is following the central Government\u2019s environmental management framework,\nadopting both command-and-control and incentive methods to reach its environmental goals.\nCommand-and-control approaches include mandatory environmental impact assessment (ElA),\nland use management, emission controls and enforcement at enterprises that do not meet\nnational  standards,  emission  permits,  closure  of  small-scale  highly  polluting  industries,\ncentralized treatment of wastes, and total emissions control. Emission monitoring is conducted\nmainly by enterprises, with periodic compliance monitoring performed by EPBs. Environmental\nmonitoring stations operated by EPBs conduct ambient air quality monitoring.\n17. Economic  incentive  approaches  include  the  pollution  levy  system,  tradable  permits,\ntaxes on polluting inputs, and tax rebates administered at the municipal level. Levies have\ntraditionally been collected only for the pollutant that most exceeds the corresponding emission\nstandard; the levies need to be modified to reflect environmental costs through charges on the\ntotal amount of emissions. The levies also need to be increased to make them more of an\nincentive for industries to make the necessary investments to reduce pollution. The existing SO\n2\ntax, based on total amount of emissions, is collected in designated SO  and acid rain control\n2\nzones. Funds from pollution levies will continue to be rebated to enterprises for improving their\npollution control facilities.\nB. Government Plans and Policies\n1. National Acid Rain Control Strategy\n18. The Government is making significant efforts to clean up the urban environment and\ncontrol industrial pollution. Investment in environmental improvement projects increased from\n                  \n13 Key provincial regulations and related documents include Circular on Levy of SO  Pollution Charges in Acid Rain\n2\nControl Zones (1998), Circular on Distribution of State Council Reply and Zoning Option of Acid Rain Control and\nSO  Pollution Control (1998), Circular on Distribution of SEPA: Circular on Implementation of SO  Levy Standards\n2 2\n(2000), the draft Integrated Program of Treatment and Control of SO  Pollution in Acid Rain Control Zones of Anhui\n2\nProvince 1999), and the draft Tenth Five-Year Environmental Protection Plan (2000).\n14TA 3121-PRC: Improving Environmental Management in Suzhou Creek, for $840,000, approved on 29 June 1999;\nTA  3325-PRC: Shanxi Air Quality Improvement Project, for $700,000, approved on  29 November 1999.\n15TA 2505-PRC: Strengthening Environmental Standards and Environmental Policies, for $600,000, approved on 22\nDecember 1995.", "6\n0.67 percent of the gross national product (GNP) during the 7FYP (1986\u20131990) period to\napproximately  0.93  percent  of  GDP  during  the  9FYP  period.  This  level  of  commitment  is\nexpected to increase to approximately 1.3 percent of GDP or about $85 billion during 10FYP.\nThe Government has increased attention to controlling acid rain damage through reduced SO\n2\nemission. The 1995 Amendment of Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law provides the legal\nbasis for acid rain prevention and control in the PRC. The law introduced the concept of SO\n2\nand acid rain control zones (Map 2). In 1998 the State Council approved the demarcation of the\ntwo control zones as proposed by SEPA. The two zones generate 60 percent of PRC\u2019s SO\n2\nemissions.  They  are  important  to  the  national  economy  considering  their  concentrated\npopulation and industrial output. The Guidance on the Development of the Tenth Five-Year Plan\nof PRC, which was approved by the People\u2019s Congress in March 2001, sets up the goal of SO\n2\nemission reduction. By the end of 2005, SO  emissions in the acid rain control zone should be\n2\nreduced by 20 percent from the emission level in 2000 (see para 20).\n19. To  implement  the  Air  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Law,  the  revised  emission\nstandards require that power plants located in the two control zones must meet both emission\nconcentration limits and mandated total emission levels. In addition, SO  emission standards\n2\nare issued for boilers, coking ovens, and cement plants. Taxing SO  emissions is an important\n2\ninstrument adopted by the Government for acid rain control. In 1998, SEPA, issued the Notice\non Extending Areas for Trial Implementation of SO  Emission Levy in the two control zones.\n2\n20. To reach the goal of the 10FYP for SO  reduction and acid rain control, the Government\n2\nwill emphasize the following strategies during the 10FYP period: (i) control SO  emission from\n2\ncoal  burning  by  limiting  the  production  and  use  of  high-sulfur  coal,  promoting  steam  coal\nwashing, accelerating desulfurization in power plants, and controlling SO  emissions from other\n2\ncoal-firing sources such as industrial boilers and kilns; (ii) promote clean energy utilization and\nimprove the energy mix by increasing the use of gas and electricity and reducing the use of high\npollution fuels in cities, promoting renewable energy, and adjusting the spatial layout of SO\n2\nemission sources; and (iii) strengthening management and monitoring by practicing regional\ntotal  SO   emission  control,  implementing  emission  permits/license  systems  on  key  SO\n2 2\nemission sources, implementing SO emission permit trading system, strengthening the SO\n2  2\nlevy system by raising charges, and establishing a national acid rain monitoring network.\n2. Provincial Acid Rain Control Plan\n21. Within the national policy framework, the Anhui provincial 10FYP has set goals for air\nquality improvement: (i) reduce SO emission by 20 percent in six cities located in the acid rain\n2 \ncontrol zone; (ii) meet SO and NO  ambient air quality standards (Class II) in all cities; (iii) meet\n2  2\nTSP ambient air quality standard (Class II) in Hefei and Huaibei, and (iv) meet TSP ambient air\nquality standard (Class III) in all other cities.16 Acid rain control in the Yangtze River Valley is\none of eight priority issues in environmental management to be addressed during the 10FYP\nperiod.  The  strategies  to  achieve  these  targets  will  include  (i)  stricter  enforcement  of\n                  \n16 National standards are as follows (annual daily average concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter):\nClass I Class II Class III\nTSP 80 200 300\nSO 20 60 100\n2\nNitrogen oxide 50 50 100\nCarbon dioxide 4,000 4,000 6,000", "7\nenvironmental and pollution standards; (ii) energy supply management (mainly cleaner coal\ntechnology and boiler modernization); and (iii) industrial source control (via cleaner technology\nupgrades in large enterprises and, where necessary, stack emissions controls).\n22. Specifically, the provincial 10FYP envisages that SO  emissions will be reduced in the\n2\nproject area from the current level of about 143,000 tons per year (t/yr) to 114,400 t/yr, which is\nequivalent to 20 percent reduction over the 10FYP period. The measures envisaged to achieve\nthis  goal  include  (i) controlling  acid  rain  and  air  pollution  through  CP,  industrial  structure\nadjustment, and relocating industries; (ii) enhancing energy efficiency and promoting clean\nenergy in power generation; (iii) increasing electricity and gas use in urban centers; (iv) closing\nsmall,  heavily  polluting  enterprises;  (v)  strengthening  institutional  capacity,  especially\nenvironmental monitoring and enforcement; (vi) promoting MBIs; and (vii) promoting public\neducation and participation. If the 10FYP projects are all implemented, acid rain frequency and\nseverity should be substantially reduced by 2005. Under the provincial SO  and acid rain control\n2\nstrategy, Anhui provincial government (APG) plans to improve pollution control for over 25 of the\nlargest polluting industries in the project area. Full implementation of the SO2 and acid rain\ncontrol strategy will require over $650 million during 2001-2005.\n3. Institutional Framework\n23. Several key agencies at the national level, are active in environmental policy making and\nimplementation.  The  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  Protection  Commission  of  the\nNational People\u2019s Congress is the major decision-making and policy formulation body. SEPA,\nelevated  to  ministerial  status  in  1998,  has  overall  responsibility  for  coordinating  national\nenvironmental policy. The State Council issues periodic decisions for enforcement of specific\nnational  environmental  objectives.  The  environmental  offices  in  other  ministries,  and\ncoordination  among  the  agencies,  need  to  be  improved  to  achieve  an  integrated  national\nenvironment policy.\n24.  Nationwide,  a  five-level  administration  system  for  environmental  protection  and\nenvironmental  management  covers  all  provinces,  autonomous  regions,  and  municipalities.\nEPBs have been established at the provincial, municipal, county, and township levels. EPBs are\nassisted  by  environmental  research  institutes  and  monitoring  centers.  Implementing\nenvironmental  policies  and  regulations  and  formulating  measures  to  improve  the  local\nenvironment are the responsibility of the provinces and municipalities. SEPA regularly collects\ninformation from EPBs to establish a nationwide profile of environmental data and to identify\nenvironmental  trends  that  could  call  for  increased  mitigation  efforts.  SEPA  also  publishes\nnational statistics on key environmental indicators and trends.\n25. Anhui has developed an environmental management organization at three levels, with\nan administrative organization similar to the central Government. The local governments are\nresponsible for environmental quality within their jurisdictions. The Provincial People's Congress\nis responsible for promulgating provincial environmental laws and regulations, according to the\nnational requirements or making them more stringent; taking note of environmental issues and\nconcerns  raised  by  the  public;  and  keeping  the  provincial  government  informed  of  public\nconcerns. The Anhui provincial EPB is headed by a vice-governor in charge of environment\nprotection; other members are the director of AEPB; and the director or deputy director of the\nAnhui Provincial Planning Commission (APPC), Provincial Trade and Economic Commission,\nProvincial Construction Commission, Anhui Provincial Finance Bureau (APFB), and related", "8\ngovernment agencies. Each city or county has an EPB.17 The total number of staff working in\nAEPB and the municipal and county EPBs was 4,104 by the end of 2000, of which 266 staff\nwork for AEPB; the remaining 3,838 work for the city, county, and township environmental\nagencies. Of the total 4,104 staff, 464 people are engaged in environmental management,\n1,351 are involved in monitoring, 106 work in research institutes, 39 are in information centers,\n978 are in pollution levy fees collection and the rest are engaged in various other functions.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n26. The World Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the United Nations\nDevelopment  Programme,  and  ADB  have  provided  major  external  assistance  to  the\nenvironment sector of the PRC.  Most of the $5.2 billion (1992-2000) World Bank assistance\nhas focused on urban environmental improvement in areas such as water supply and sanitation,\nclean energy and energy efficiency, and air pollution control. The World Bank Group also\nfinanced a multiyear program that included sector studies, institutional strengthening, and loan\nsupport  for  environmental  protection  investments,  primarily  at  the  provincial  and  municipal\nlevels. The World Bank\u2019s policy dialogue emphasizes environmental strategies such as MBIs,\nand promotion of diverse environmental investments (air pollution control, water, and natural\nresource  and  management).  By  end-2000,  ADB  had  provided  over  $2.4  billion  to  support\nimproved management of environment and natural resources (about $2.1 billion for control of\nindustrial and urban pollution and $0.3 billion for natural resources management). Total lending\nfor environment-related projects represents approximately 25 percent of total ADB lending to the\nPRC.18\n27. An  ongoing  World  Bank-supported  Enterprise  Reform  Project  aims  to  learn  from\ninnovative methods for the reform of PRC\u2019s state-owned enterprise sector and help deepen\nenterprise reform. The enterprise reform measures under this project address (i) corporate\nrestructuring  and  transformation  of  large  and  medium-size  enterprises,  (ii)  management\ndevelopment, (iii) retraining and reemployment of laid-off state enterprise employees, and (iv)\ndevelopment of private small and medium-size enterprises. The project is being implemented in\nthe municipalities of Changsha, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Wuhu. The assessment of the pilot\nexperience will be disseminated beyond the pilot municipalities. It is anticipated that the proven\nsuccessful measures for enterprise reforms will be replicated by other enterprises.\n28. The UNDP has financed studies on marine pollution monitoring, and coal preparation,\nand \u2013through the Global Environment Facility\u2013studies relating to the development of coal bed\nmethane resources and their impact on climate change, and for outlining issues and options in\ngreenhouse gas emissions control. JBIC has provided 19 loans totaling approximately $2.75\nbillion for water supply and treatment, and environmental management in a number of cities.\nOther bilateral sources active in the environment sector include Australia, Canada, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Italy, and Sweden.  Bilateral assistance has focused mainly on wastewater\n                  \n17Anhui Province has 17 cities, and 105 counties and districts, for a total of 122 administrative jurisdictions within the\nprovince.\n18 ADB has assisted Anhui Province with one industrial modernization loan (Loan 1161-PRC: Anqing Acrylic Fiber)\nand two environmental improvement loans (Loans 1490/91-PRC: Anhui Environmental Improvement Project) \u2013 the\nformer was successfully implemented, while the latter loans will be completed in 2002. ADB has also given three\nadvisory TAs for municipal wastewater treatment in Chao Lake and industrial pollution abatement in four industries\nnear Chao Lake (TA 2670-PRC: Strengthening of Enterprise Reform in Anhui Province, for $600,000, approved on\n25 October 1996; TA  2693-PRC: Formulation of an Integrated Environmental Management Plan for Chao Lake\nBasin, for $800,000, approved on 26 November 1996; and TA  2751-PRC: Capacity Building for Wastewater\nTreatment Operations in Anhui Province, for $400,000, approved on 27 January 1997).", "9\nand  sewage  treatment,  energy  conservation,  and  coal  gasification  to  address  urban\nenvironmental problems.\nD. Lessons Learned\n29. The PRC Country Assistance Program Evaluation conducted in 1998 indicates that\nsince 1991 ADB\u2019s strategic objectives for the energy, environment, industry sectors, and their\nevolution over time, have been appropriate.19 ADB has been able to play an effective role in\nassisting the PRC in these sectors. The loan projects addressing environmental problems in\nseveral major cities have been generally successful.20 The focus on energy efficiency and\nenvironmental issues has proven to be successful.  It was found that in these operations,\nsavings in energy and other financial costs associated with environmental pollution can be large\nenough to repay the loans. The December 2000 Country Portfolio Review Mission endorsed the\nfindings.  However, it identified the following issues in project implementation: (i) delay in project\ncommencement; (ii) change in project scope and delay in project completion; (iii) delay in\nprocurement,  contract  awards,  particularly  in  civil  works;  and  (iv) nonadherence  to  policy\nrevision and financial covenants.\n30. The  implementation  of  about  25  environmental  improvement  and  energy  efficiency\nsubprojects supported by ADB loans21 was examined during project processing. ADB-financed\nphysical facilities are generally completed in accordance with design specifications. Project\ncompletion was mostly on schedule; some subprojects were completed ahead of schedule.\nThese  achievements  are  attributed  to  strong  project  implementation  capability.  The  strong\nsense  of  ownership  and  experienced  technical  team  further  contributed  to  successful\ncompletion of projects. Environmental improvement and energy conservation objectives set out\nduring appraisal were substantially met.\n31. The  review,  however,  identified  several  emerging  concerns.  Timely  availability  of\ndomestic resources is a constraint in some projects involving enterprises. This is partly an\noutcome  of  the  financial  sector  reforms  introduced  since  the  mid-1990s  under  which\ngovernment  agencies  can  no  longer  direct  banks  to  support  priority  projects.  Financial\nmanagement, including data collection, management reporting, accounting, auditing, and level\n                  \n19 Doc. IN. 29-99: Country Assistance Program Evaluation in the People's Republic of China, circulated to the Board\non 25 January 1999.\n20 The status of implementation of environmental improvement projects is as follows:\n(i) Loan 1205-PRC: Qingdao Environmental Improvement Project, for $103 million, approved on 10 December\n1992, is completed, but due to a reduction scope, the environmental benefits will be below appraisal estimates.\n(ii) Loan 1270-PRC: Tangshan and Chengde Environmental Improvement Project, for $140 million, approved on 25\nNovember 1993, is completed except for the recently approved additional wastewater treatment facilities and\nreformation of old kilns in Tangshan.  Full environmental benefits are expected.\n(iii) Loan 1336-PRC: Beijing Environmental Improvement Project, for $157 million, approved on 29 November\n1994,  implementation  was  delayed  but  is  now  proceeding  smoothly.  The  project  will  make  a  substantial\ncontribution to reducing air pollution in Beijing. The disposal and treatment of hazardous wastes and the relocation\nand renovation of chemical plant components were cancelled.\n(iv) Loan 1490-PRC: Anhui Environmental Improvement Project for Municipal Wastewater Treatment, for $28\nmillion, approved on 26 November 1996.\n(v) Loan 1491-PRC: Anhui Environmental Improvement Project for Industrial Pollution Abatement, for  $112 million,\napproved on 26 November 1996\n(vi) Loan 1543-PRC: Xi'an-Xianyang-Tongchuan Environment Improvement Project, for $156 million, approved on\n24  September  1997,  are  proceeding  well  except  for  the  two  cogeneration  components  in  Xianyang  and\nTongchuan.\n21  Qingdao Environment Improvement  (Loan  1207-PRC);  Fertilizer Industry Restructuring  (Loan  1248-PRC);\nTangshan and Chengde Environment Improvement (Loan 1270-PRC); Beijing Environmental Improvement (Loan\n1336-PRC); Second Industrial Energy Efficiency and Environment Improvement (Loan 1436-PRC); and Xian-\nXianyang-Tongchuan Environment Improvement (Loan 1543-PRC).", "10\nof disclosure, is generally weak and needs strengthening. The two ongoing Anhui environmental\nimprovement projects are being implemented in a satisfactory manner. All subprojects were\ncompleted within the appraisal cost estimates and implementation schedule, except that the\nHefei Iron and Steel subproject was delayed by one year because of a shortfall in counterpart\nfunding.  The  completed  facilities  are  performing  as  envisaged,  and  energy  efficiency  and\nenvironmental improvement have largely been realized.\n32. Lower market prices that prevailed for most of the public utility type projects (such as\ndistrict  heating,  gas,  and  wastewater  treatment)  encourraged  shift  to  environment  friendly\nenergy  use  that  produced  substantial  environmental  benefits.  For  some  utility  enterprises,\nGovernment subsidies including loan repayments are crucial for survival. External intervention\nin price determination, and availability of cheaper substitutes in the increasingly competitive\nmarkets  have  adversely  impinged  on  the  financial  viability  of  some  subprojects.  Industrial\nsubprojects  have  performed  relatively  better  though  their  financial  performance  has  been\ngenerally lower than projected. Financial performance in some industrial enterprises has been\nunfavorable due to their inability to respond to changing market conditions. This inability will be\neven more critical since PRC\u2019s membership to the World Trade Organization will increase\ncompetition by connecting domestic and global markets.\n33. Lack  of  exposure  to  modern  management  techniques  and  limited  research  and\ndevelopment could adversely affect the future prospects of these enterprises. While ADB loan\nfunds for human resource development were provided in all past projects, these funds were\nintended for international training on technical matters and operation and maintenance (O&M)\nactivities.  Most  enterprises  opted  to  use  only  part  of  the  allocated  loan  funds  to  finance\ninternational training of their O&M staff. The enterprises did not fully recognize the need to\nadopt modern management techniques and were reluctant to spend scarce foreign exchange\nfor management training. These lessons have been taken into account during project design\nthrough  various  human  resource  development  activities  in  the  institutional  strengthening\ncomponent.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n34. ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  the  PRC  is  designed  to  assist  in  (i)  improving  the\nefficiency  of  the  economy,  (ii)  promoting  growth  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  poorer  interior\nprovinces,  and  (iii) improve  environmental  and  natural  resource  management.  In  the\nenvironment  sector,  the  strategy  focuses  on  (i) strengthening  the  policy  and  regulatory\nframework  for  sustainable  environmental  management;  (ii)  supporting  capacity-building\nprograms for EIA monitoring and enforcement; (iii) supporting the use of economic measures\n(taxes,  charges,  and  fees),  supply-side  measures  (integrated  resource  planning  and  fuel\nswitching), and other measures (waste minimization and recycling) to ensure sustainable use of\nnatural resources; and (iv) promoting the use of cleaner process technologies for industrial\nproduction and clean energy technologies for power generation. The Project, with its emphasis\non improving environmental quality, is fully in accord with ADB\u2019s PRC country operational\nstrategy to support environmentally sustainable economic growth.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n1.  Acid Rain Control\n35. The Government has recognized acid rain as a major threat to the economic and social\nwell-being  of  a  vast  proportion  of  the  country.  In  1998,  the  Government  through  SEPA", "11\ndesignated two control zones, one for acid rain control and the other for SO  control. ADB\n2\nprovided TAs to study the regional dimensions of the acid rain problem (footnote 9). The\nGovernment  is  aware  that  the  two  control  zone  programs  have  several  weaknesses.  The\nunderstanding of source-receptor relationships (impact reduction vs. emission reduction) and\ncost-effectiveness in selecting abatement measures need to be improved. The threshold sulfur\ncontent value for the coal consumed by power plants needs to be tightened. Among other\nweaknesses are (i) inconsistent or counterproductive economic and environmental policies; (ii)\ninadequate  institutional  capacity,  especially  for  monitoring  and  enforcement;  (iii)  lack  of\ntechnical know-how and inadequate management and technical capability, particularly for small\nand medium-size enterprises; and (iv) inadequate economic incentive for polluting sources to\nadopt cleaner production processes. These need attention to achieve the 10FYP\u2019s objective of\n20 percent SO  reduction in the two control zones.\n2\n36. The major programs developed for acid rain control include provincial and sector SO\n2\nreduction plans; promotion of clean energy and CP; closure of small high-sulfur coal mines,\nsmall  power  generation  units,  small  cement  and  small  glass  plants;  and  controlling  major\npolluting sources. Often, SO  reduction is linked with greenhouse gas (GHG), such as CO\n2 2\nlevels. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a flexible tool that is prescribed under the\n,\nKyoto protocol to reduce GHG emissions. CDM will allow emission reduction credit to be\ngenerated through projects such as for cleaner energy and energy efficiency in developing\ncountries. The PRC has a large potential to use CDM. ADB is pursuing this potential through its\npolicy dialogue under a TA.22\n37. The  Government  recognizes  that  a  comprehensive  approach  instead  of  ad  hoc\nmeasures should be adopted for acid rain control. In line with these developments, APG is\nimplementing a comprehensive acid rain control plan in a phased manner, initially in the project\narea and existing acid rain and SO  control zones, and later the entire province. APG will\n2\nstrengthen environmental management decision-making systems, monitoring and enforcement\nbacked by incentive measures to reduce acid rain and environmental pollution. Activities related\nto policy dialogue include (i) implementation of the provincial SO  and acid rain control plan;\n2\n(ii) promotion  of  CP;  (iii) introduction  of  MBIs  for  air  pollution  control  and  improved\nenvironmental management; (iv) promotion of cleaner energy source and energy efficiency; (v)\nsupport for environmental investments in small- and medium-scale industries; (vi) closure of\ninefficient and polluting small-scale, loss-incurring industrial enterprises; and (vi) recylcing of\nproject funds for acid rain control (para 61).\n2. Enterprise Restructuring\n38. Over the past decade, autonomy in economic management has gradually increased\nthrough  the  introduction  of  market  forces,  competition,  and  opening  of  the  economy  to\ninternational trade and investment.  With legislation such as the Company Law in 1994, the\n1999 Accounting Act, and the 1999 Securities Law, more state-owned enterprises (SOEs)\nbegan  to  corporatize  by  creating  either  limited-liability  companies  (LLCs)  or  limited-liability\nshareholding companies (LLSCs), with the State remaining as the major owner. This new legal\nframework allowed the companies registered as LLSCs to offer their shares to the public\nthrough the Shanghai Stock Exchange or the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The introduction of\ncorporatization and the shareholding system is helping to improve corporate governance in the\nday-to-day management of enterprises by separating the owner and management functions of\nthe State. The enterprises were to divest the previously noncore businesses and their social\n                  \n22TA 5297-REG: Promotion of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in Greenhouse Gas Abatement, for\n$5,000,000, approved on 4 January 2001.", "12\nfunctions (e.g., medical care, housing, canteens, child-care centers, and schools) to create\nleaner  enterprises.  If  properly  restructured  to  operate  in  a  modern  corporate  form,  the\nenterprises  will  benefit  from  the  newly  introduced  reforms  such  as  competition  in  product\nmarkets, capital markets, and labor and managerial markets.\n39. Initially pilot tested, enterprise reform has now become a mainstream economic activity\n(Appendix 3). In Anhui Province, the Provincial Economic and Trade Commission considered\n145 of 210 larger enterprises to have completed the formal phase of reform as of March 2001.23\nThirty-eight additional large enterprises are expected to complete the process by the end of\n2001. The reformed companies have adopted either a simple LLC, or LLSC with domestic listing\nof shares in some cases. Enterprise reform was an important feature of Loans 1490/1491 that\nprovided for investment activities accompanied by reform of four industrial enterprises and two\nmunicipal wastewater treatment utilities.24  With one exception (Hefei Iron and Steel Company),\nthese reform measures have been fully met to date and the reforms are proceeding well.25\n40. The Government and APG recognize that enterprise governance is essential for the\nviability and sustainability of environmental improvement. Hence, the enterprises will pursue\nrestructuring to achieve higher levels of corporate governance. A substantial portion of the\nproposed  ADB  assistance  will  be  used  for  restructuring.  The  policy  dialogue  led  to  the\nestablishment of Wuhu Hengchang Copper Refinery Company (WHC) as a new LLC in June\n2001. All enterprises have reached different stages of enterprise reform.  It was agreed that\neach CP enterprise will prepare a time-bound action plan for future restructuring and conversion\nto a LLSC. The enterprise restructuring strategies for all enterprises will cover four key areas:\n(i) business strategy plans, (ii) corporate governance, (iii) accounting and financial reporting,\nand  (iv) information  technology  upgrade.  As  part  of  the  policy  dialogue,  the  following  was\nagreed upon: (i) diversification of the board of directors for each enterprise; (ii) adoption of\ninternational  accounting  standards  as  of  31  December  2003;  (iii)  constitution  of  audit,\nperformance evaluation, and risk management committees; (iv) appointment of internal auditors,\nfinancial controllers, and external auditors; and (v) use of competitive bidding for procurement.\nFurther, most enterprises will take steps to separate their noncore businesses such as schools,\nhospitals, and hotels from their main activities. Separating noncore activities will be completed\nbefore loan disbursements.\n41. Traditional management practices and unwillingness to face social problems associated\nwith enterprise reforms, particularly in laying off redundant workers, are some of the reasons for\nslow progress in enterprise restructuring. During policy dialogue, APG agreed to continue to\nrestructure  subproject  enterprises,  promote  corporate  governance,  and  strengthen  their\nmanagement capabilities to face market competition in the future. The remaining challenges for\nenterprise restructuring include (i) diversifying the shareholding system to reduce the State\u2019s\nshare and bring new investors with capital, management know-how, technology, and access to\nwider markets; (ii) strengthening the corporate governance structure by empowering board\nmembers;  (iii) improving  management  practices  through  a  proper  performance  evaluation,\n                  \n23The World Bank is currently implementing an enterprise reform and restructuring project in the area. The objective\nis to learn from innovative methods for the reform of state-owned enterprises.  The project is addressing enterprise\nreform measures for the following: (i) corporate restructuring and transformation of medium-size enterprises,\n(ii) management development, and (iii) retraining and reemployment of laid-off state enterprise employees. The\ndevelopment  of  private  small  and  medium-size  enterprises  is  also  a  priority.  Lessons  learned  have  been\nconsidered in designing the Project.\n24TA 2670-PRC: Strengthening of Enterprise Reform in Anhui Province, for $600,000, approved on 25 October 1996.\n25Of the four subproject enterprises under Loan 1491-PRC: Anhui Environmental Improvement Project for Industrial\nPollution Abatement (footnote 20), only one has not made adequate progress on enterprise reform because the\nenterprise has not demonstrated three consecutive years of profit.", "13\ninformation, and incentive system; and (iv) training the board, management, and employees to\nimplement restructuring (operational, organizational, labor, and financial) while measuring the\nresults in terms of increases in factor productivity, profitability, and in rate of return on capital.\n3.  Promotion of Cleaner Production\n42. The Government's 10FYP on environmental protection prioritizes CP as a mechanism\nfor  pursuing  sustainable  development  especially  in  the  industry  and  energy  sectors.  The\nGovernment  is  shifting  its  pollution  abatement  efforts  from  \u201cend-of-pipe  control\u201d  toward\nprevention at source. MBIs are considered as a major means to achieve the objective. ADB is\nplaying a major role in helping introduce CP through a TA cluster with six subprojects. 26\nSubproject 1 developed a policy package for promoting CP, while subproject 2 and 3 are\nassisting the Government in establishing a national network for CP technology transfer and\ndrafting the CP law. The draft will be submitted to the National People's Congress at the end of\n2001. The law will provide a legal basis for promoting CP. The other three subprojects (4, 5 and\n6) will assist in developing CP technology, environmental management in CP and financing\nmechanism  for  CP  in  town  and  village  enterprises.  ADB  has  also  provided  assistance  in\nestablishing successful CP transfer centers,27 which have spread to two provinces under the TA\ncluster.\n43. Investments  promoting  CP  initiated  under  the  Project  are  a  result  of  these  policy\ndevelopments.  ADB  will  continue  to  pursue  dialogue  for  introducing  and  mainstreaming\nenvironmental audits, encouraging the adoption of best-available technology, and promoting\nenvironmental awareness and environment-friendly behavior among consumers and producers.\nAPG recognizes that further investments are required on the use of cleaner fuel, improved\nenergy efficiency, and promotion of CP technologies. In this regard, APG is pursuing various\noptions including a sustainable financing mechanism that will expand investments through an\nacid rain control fund for promoting CP technologies.\n4.  Institutional Strengthening\n44. Most  enterprises  in  Anhui  lack  knowledge  of  and  expertise  in  modern  enterprise\nmanagement. Some management staff benefited from mini-master\u2019s in business administration\n(MBA) or executive education training offered at local universities; more managers could benefit\nfrom similar training. The research and development capabilities of enterprises need to be\nstrengthened to promote efficiency improvement programs and be better attuned with state-of-\nthe-art technical innovations. During project processing, the importance of allocating sufficient\nloan funds for developing human resources and to enable them to adopt modern management\nprograms  and  practices  was  stressed.  Each  subproject  includes  management  training\nprograms, organizational restructuring plans, and enterprise governance procedures in their\nstrategic restructuring plans. Each subproject will allocate a portion of the loan proceeds for\nupgrading  the  management  information  system  along  with  other  institutional  strengthening\nactivities. Further, appropriate human resource development activities will be undertaken for\noverall project management. An important capacity-building component of the Project relates to\nthe purchase of equipment and human resource development to establish an environmental and\nacid rain monitoring network in the project area.\n                  \n26 TA 3079-PRC: Promotion of Cleaner Technology (Cluster), for $3.5 million, approved on 29 September 1998, is\nADB\u2019s first TA  cluster.\n27 TA 2434-PRC: Establishing a Center for Transfer of Environmentally Sound Technology, for $550,000, approved\non 31 October 1995.", "14\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n45. The Project is designed to reduce acid rain in Anhui, a relatively poor province with a per\ncapita GDP that is only 72 percent of the national average. The air quality in the Yangtze River\nValley has deteriorated to harmful levels. Without intervention, air quality will further deteriorate\nand acid rain frequency will increase, with serious negative implications for public health and\neconomic  development.  APG  is  implementing  an  acid  rain  control  plan  to  address  these\nconcerns.  APG  has  demonstrated  strong  sense  of  ownership  of  the  Project  by  identifying\nsubprojects with adequate provision for local currency financing. A cause-effect and project\nobjective tree analysis is found in Appendix 4.\n46. The  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  provincial  acid  rain  control  strategy,  and  is\nconsistent with the Government\u2019s strategy to clean up the environment by improving air and\nwater quality in the acid rain control zone of the PRC. It is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy to\nsupport measures for environmental improvement and natural resource management in the\nPRC. The Project, if approved, will be the eighth environmental improvement project supported\nby  ADB  in  the  PRC  and  the  first  to  focus  on  acid  rain  control.  It  will  also  be  the  first\nenvironmental  improvement  project  to  be  implemented  solely  in  secondary  cities  (Guichi,\nHuangshan, Tongling, and Wuhu).\nB. Objective and Scope\n47. The main objective of the Project is to improve the ambient air quality and reduce acid\nrain to improve the environment in the Yangtze River Valley in Anhui Province. The Project will\npromote CP, reduce waste, improve energy efficiency, improve the environment in ecological\nsites, and support institutional strengthening for environmental management and enterprise\ngovernance.\n48. The Project has three main components: (i) six CP promotion subprojects undertaken by\nindustrial enterprises, (ii) three environmental improvement and acid rain damage rehabilitation\n(EI-ARD) subprojects in ecologically protected areas (Huangshan and Jiuhua mountains), and\n(iii)  one  institutional  strengthening  component  to  be  undertaken  by  provincial  and  local\nenvironmental agencies and subproject enterprises. The subprojects will reduce SO  and other\n2\ngases causing acid rain through the use of CP technology, improved energy efficiency, reduced\nwaste,  and  technology  advancements;  and  will  improve  environmental  management  and\nrehabilitate acid rain damage.\n49. As part of the ADB-funded project preparatory TA, all subprojects proposed under the\nacid rain control plan were reviewed and a shortlist of subprojects was established. Shortlisting\nwas  based  on  willingness  to  make  investments  in  acid  rain  control  and  environmental\nimprovement  activities,  relative  contribution  to  SO   emission  reduction  and  environmental\n2\nimprovement, and location and managerial advantages. In the second stage, a comprehensive\nenterprise-level  assessment  of  the  subprojects\u2019  ability  to  perform  using  market-based\napproaches under enterprise reform and macroeconomic uncertainties was undertaken. Many\nfactors\u2014financial, environmental, and cost-effectiveness\u2014were considered in the evaluation.\nThe Government and ADB followed a rigorous evaluation process, which examined financial,\neconomic and social aspects, including counterpart funding availability, enterprise viability and\nsustainability,  and  enterprise  management  capabilities.  The  six  industrial  enterprises  for", "15\npromoting CP were selected based on the results of this overall assessment. Three ecological\nsubprojects at two sites for environmental improvement and acid rain damage rehabilitation\nwere selected based on their ecological importance, unique biodiversity, and national and\ninternational significance.\n1. Cleaner Production Enterprises\n50. The six CP subprojects will entail investments to reduce SO  and other gases causing\n2\nacid  rain  through  CP,  reduced  waste,  technology  advancements,  and  improved  energy\nefficiency. \n51. Anhui Tongdu Copper Limited Company (ATC). The subproject will upgrade the\nsmelter/blast  furnace  system  for  producing  blister  copper  (65,000  t/yr),  electrolytic  copper\n(15,000  t/yr),  and  associated  by-products;  and  install  a  double  conversion  and  double\nabsorption process to replace the current single conversion and single absorption process. This\nwill result in a 38 percent (14,890 t/yr) reduction in SO  emission in Tongling city.\n2\n52. Chizhou Non-Ferrous Metals Group Company (CNM). The subproject will upgrade\nthe  main  process  line  for  producing  electrolytic  copper  (20,000  t/yr  with  a  more  efficient\ntechnology), capture SO  emissions for conversion to high-quality sulfuric acid, and relocate\n2\nprocess lines away from a residential area and toward a new industrial zone. CNM\u2019s SO\n2\nemissions (6,291 t/yr) account for about 61 percent of the total SO  emission (10,313 t/yr) in the\n2\ncity of Chizou. The subproject will reduce SO by 59 percent (6,040 t/yr) and eliminate the threat\n2 \nposed by toxic metal emission.\n53. Wuhu  Feiying  Wood  Chemicals  Limited  Company  (WFW).  The  subproject  will\nrelocate the chemical plant from a residential area to the Wuhu Industrial Development Zone;\neliminate current high pollution processes and products, and use state-of-the-art CP technology\nto produce three industrial chemicals (paraformaldehyde, formaldehyde, and acrylic impact\nmodifiers). WFW is the largest source of water pollution and the third largest source of air\npollution in Wuhu City. Its chemical oxygen demand (COD) and SO  discharge account for 14\n2\npercent and 6 percent, respectively, of the total in Wuhu City. The subproject will reduce SO by\n2 \n6 percent (1,372 t/yr) and eliminate the largest pollution threat to municipal drinking water.\n54. Wuhu Hengchang Copper Refinery Company (WHC). The subproject will introduce\npyro-smelting furnaces and establish a state-of-the-art refinery furnace and automatic copper\ncasting system; replace the blast furnaces with an advanced oxygen-enhanced anode furnace;\nand add auxiliary systems for producing electrolytic copper (75,000 t/yr) and commercial copper\nproducts  (35,000  t/yr),  polished  copper  bars  (21,000  t/yr),  copper  sheets,  and  600  km/yr\ntelecommunication cables). WHC is the third largest SO  source in Wuhu, accounting for 15\n2\npercent (3,308 t/yr) of the total SO  emissions in the city. The subproject will reduce SO by 9\n2 2 \npercent (1,952 t/yr). Acidic wastewater discharges are 1.5 million t/yr.\n55. Wuhu Shanjiang Chemicals Limited Company (WSC). The subproject will upgrade\nthe caustic soda production line from the diaphragm process (35,000 t/yr) to the ion-membrane\nprocess (30,000 t/yr); construct a cogeneration station to supply electricity and process heat in\nthe Wuhu Industrial Development Zone and replace 29 small boilers; and relocate dyestuff\nprocessing to reduce water pollution. WSC is a large emitter of SO , accounting for 22 percent\n2\n(4,981 t/yr) of total emission. The subproject will reduce SO by 20 percent (4,533 t/yr) in the\n2 \ncity.  It is also the fourth largest water pollution source in the city.", "16\n56. Wuhu Zhengxing Materials Limited Company (WZM). The subproject will demolish\nthe current steel making system to eliminate air pollution and high energy consumption (annual\ncapacity of 400,000 t pig iron, 600,000 t sintered ore, and 175,000 t coke); modify the current\niron making system, use iron produced to make ductile iron pipe and fittings; expand the\ncogeneration system to fully use the combustible gas from the iron furnace and coking process;\nand construct a system for treating wastewater and processing water for reuse. It is the second\nlargest SO  emission source in Wuhu and accounts for 18 percent  (4,104 t/yr) of the total SO\n2 2\nemissions in the city. In addition, WZM discharges 6.39 million t/yr of wastewater into the\nupstream of the drinking water source of Wuhu City including 89 t/yr of phenol and 8.6 t/yr of\ncyanide. The subproject reduce SO by 11 percent (2,545 t/yr), and eliminate phenol and\n2 \ncyanide discharges and improve energy efficiency and water quality.\n2. EI-ARD Entities\n57. Environmental improvement and rehabilitation of acid rain damage in the Huangshan\necological site will be undertaken by the Huangshan Electric Company (HEC) and Huangshan\nWater Company (HWC). The Jiuhua Tourism Group Company (JTC) will be responsible for\nenvironmental improvement work in Jiuhua ecological site. Rehabilitation work for acid rain\ndamage including improvement in electricity supply, water supply, sewage treatment, forest fire\nprotection in protected areas, and solid waste management to reduce impacts of local air\nemissions,  will  be  the  main  focus.  Improvements  in  environmental  monitoring  systems  to\ndocument acid rain impacts will also be undertaken at the two sites.\n3.  Institutional Strengthening\n58. Institutional strengthening will benefit APG and the subproject enterprises. First, at APG-\nlevel activities will focus on institutional strengthening of the project management office (PMO),\nAEPB, APFB, APPC, and their municipality-level counterparts and all subproject enterprises.\nThe second task includes capacity building for improved operations management systems and\nprovision of training for human resource development at the enterprise level (Appendix 5). At\nthe  subproject  enterprise  level  there  will  be  two  main  activities:  (i)  introduce  and  improve\nemerging corporate governance by creating diversity in the board of directors and appointing\ncross-industrial and cross-regional members; and (ii) strengthen overall financial and operations\nmanagement, as well as financial reporting systems of subproject enterprises.  At the APG\nlevel,  there  will  be  four  main  tasks:  (i) strengthen  the  capabilities  of  the  PMO  in  project\nadministration; (ii) assist APG in understanding ADB\u2019s procurement procedures and reporting,\ninternational specifications, and tendering procedures including contracting, quality control, and\nproject performance monitoring system; (iii) strengthen environmental policy-making capabilities\nof  APPC;  (iv)  improve  financial  management  skill  at  APFB;  (v)  improve  environmental\nmonitoring  capabilities;  and  (vi)  strengthen  public  health  and  environmental  awareness\nprograms in AEPB, and other relevant organizations.\nC. Cost Estimates\n59. The total project cost is $325 million equivalent including taxes, physical and price\ncontingencies, and interest and other charges during construction. Foreign exchange costs are\nestimated at $147 million (45 percent) and local currency costs at $178 million equivalent\n(55 percent). A summary is given in Tables 1 and 2, with details in Appendix 6. About 79\npercent of the project cost is for CP, 16 percent for EI-ARD, and 5 percent for institutional\nstrengthening.", "17\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Exchange Local Currency Total Cost\nA.

The Borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of China. The ADB loan in US dollars will\ncome from ADB's ordinary capital resources and will carry an interest rate to be determined in\naccordance with ADB's LIBOR-based loan facility, a 1 percent front-end fee charged upon loan\neffectiveness, and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum. The Borrower will make\nthe  loan  proceeds  available  to  APG  for  relending  to  the  subproject  enterprises  through\nsubsidiary loan agreements. The loan for six CP enterprises will have a repayment period of 14\nyears, including a grace period of 4 years and for EI-ARD subproject enterprises with an\namortization period of 20 years including a 4-year grace period. Relending for the institutional\nstrengthening component will be similar to the respective subproject enterprises\u2019 terms. Lending\nterms for APG\u2019s institutional strengthening component will be similar to those for the loans. The\nsubproject enterprises will be the Implementing Agencies for their respective subprojects. The\nforeign exchange and interest rate variation risks will be borne by the implementing agencies.\nThe  loan  proceeds  for  institutional  strengthening  will  be  made  available  to  PMO  through\nbudgetary allocations. All subprojects will generate sufficient cash to buy the required foreign\nexchange currencies to service the loan. The project implementation agencies (PIAs) will be\nprovided with necessary foreign exchange for ADB debt service and the PIAs will bear the\nforeign exchange risk. The counterpart funds generated from the repayment of loan proceeds\nwill be utilized by APG for financing other environmental improvement and acid rain control\nprojects. APG will keep ADB informed of the progress of utilizing such funds.\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Management Office\n62. The Project Management Office (PMO) has been established for the Project. APG,\nthrough the PMO, will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. The PMO is headed by a\ndirector  and  comprises  senior  representatives  from  APFB,  AEPB,  and  APPC.  The  PMO's\nresponsibilities include (i) supervision, overall coordination, macrolevel project management and\nmonitoring including implementing policy reforms and other institutional measures; (ii) preparing\nthe annual budget and monitoring the use of loan proceeds; (iii) project-wide quality control and\nassurance; (iv) preparing procurement-related documents, bid evaluation and recommendations\nfor contract awards; reporting progress to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), relevant government", "19\nagencies,  and  ADB;  (v)  cost  management,  assessing  project  impact  and  environmental\nimprovement; (vi) supporting interagency coordination and procurement; (vii) facilitating training\nand human resource development; and (viii) ensuring compliance with loan covenants and\nreporting requirements.  The personnel skills mix of the PMO will need to be adjusted from time\nto time to reflect the needs of the various phases of project implementation.\n2. Project Implementation Office\n63. The six CP enterprises and the three EI-ARD enterprises will be the PIAs of their\nrespective subprojects. Each subproject has established a project implementation office (PIO)\nheaded  by  its  director  and  staffed  by  adequate  personnel  to  supervise  day-to-day\nimplementation of the subproject. The PIOs will be responsible for administrative, financial, and\ntechnical supervision of the subprojects and their implementation. The PIOs will manage (i)\nregular  implementation  of  their  components,  engagement  of  consultants,  and selection  of\ncontractors; (ii) facilitate ADB\u2019s approval for procurement and related documents; (iii) evaluate\nbids and recommend award of contracts; (iv) prepare and submit quarterly reports on the\nsubprojects, and audited financial statements of the enterprise to ADB; (v) procure equipment\nand materials financed under local currency funds; (vi) manage and report on the human\nresource development programs; (vii) supervise civil works, installation, and commissioning of\nthe subproject facilities; and (viii) liaise with concerned Government agencies as required.\n3. Implementation\n64. The Project will be implemented over four years starting in January 2002 (Appendix 7).\nPreparatory  work  began  in  May  2001  with  the  drafting  of  bidding  documents  that  will  be\ncompleted by early 2002. Procurement, construction, and installation work will take about three\nyears, while commissioning will take about 9-12 months. The subprojects will be completed by\nDecember 2005 and the loan will be closed in June 2006. International firms will be engaged to\n(i) supervise detailed engineering design that will be carried out by local design institutes, (ii)\nsupply  key  engineering  process  and  equipment,  (iii)  supervise  equipment  installation  and\ncommissioning  to  be  carried  out  by  local  construction  companies  or  the  workforce  of  the\nsubprojects, and (iv) arrange for international training. The engineering contractors will also be\nresponsible for securing process performance guarantees.\n65. The designs for the subprojects will include performance specifications, requirements,\nand criteria. The engineering contractors will supervise the preparation of detailed designs of\nthe processes and related equipment.  This will help ensure that the designs, performance, and\nrelated  guarantees  are  the  responsibility  of  a  single  supplier.  Similarly,  each  engineering\ncontractor as part of the bid will provide specialized technical support during installation, start-\nup, and commissioning.  The equipment and processes will be tested during commissioning to\nensure that performance criteria have been met, and the supplier will resolve any problems.\n4. Consulting Services\n66. APG  will  engage  consultants  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  according  to  ADB's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Consulting services are required for two purposes: (i)\ninstitutional strengthening, and (ii) project implementation. Institutional strengthening will require\n30  person-months  of  international  and  30  of  domestic  consulting  services.  Project\nimplementation will require 10 person-months of international and 10 of domestic consulting\nservices. Outline terms of reference for consulting services for institutional strengthening and\nproject implementation are in Appendix 8. The work for institutional strengthening includes", "20\npromotion  of  corporate  governance,  financial  management,  information  technology\ndevelopment, and demand and market analysis. Required work for project implementation\nincludes (i) reviewing the adequacy of the preliminary design, (ii) checking the specifications of\nequipment  and  materials,  (iii)  ensuring  quality  control,  and  (iv)  ensuring  incorporation  of\ninternational codes and standards. The required expertise includes design engineering, bid\npreparation and evaluation, technology assessment, enterprise restructuring, cost accounting,\nfinancial management, and information technology systems development.\n67. Using their own funds, the enterprises will have engaged the services of local design\ninstitutes to provide consulting services relating to preliminary design and detailed engineering\nwork. These institutes are major organizations in their respective fields and are experienced in\nengineering and construction of chemical and industrial plants and protected area management\nsystems. They will be selected on the basis of their previous experience and satisfactory\nperformance  in  similar  projects,  and  capability  to  provide  the  required  services.  These\ninstitutions will (i) prepare preliminary designs of the respective subprojects; (ii) prepare basic\nspecifications of equipment and materials, and bid documents; (iii) assist the enterprises in\ntechnical bid evaluation; (iv) prepare detailed design under the supervision of the engineering\ncontractors; (v) assist the enterprises and the engineering contractors in supervising equipment\ninstallation and construction of the facilities provided under the subprojects; and (vi) assist the\nenterprises  and  engineering  contractors  in  commissioning  the  facilities  and  performing\nguarantee tests.  These consultants will engaged using procedures acceptable to ADB.\n5. Procurement\n68. All ADB-financed goods and services will be procured following ADB's Guidelines for\nProcurement. In accordance with government policy, each PIA will engage a procurement\nagency or agencies for assistance in procurement-related matters. The equipment and services\nfinanced from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured through international competitive\nbidding  (ICB)  or  international  shopping  (IS)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nProcurement. Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost the equivalent\nof $500,000 or more will be awarded based on ICB procedures. Those valued at less than\n$500,000 will be awarded on IS procedures. Equipment packages with estimated values below\n$100,000 will be procured through direct purchase. Civil works which are located in scattered\nand isolated locations and are unlikely to attract any foreign bidders will be procured through\nlocal competitive bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. To facilitate project\nimplementation,  advance  procurement  action  was  approved  for  engaging  international\nengineering contractors and acquiring process licenses and critical equipment. A list of the\ntentative procurement packages is in Appendix 9.\n6. Anticorruption Measures\n69. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added\nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the\nneed for bidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of\nethics  in  procuring  and  executing  ADB-financed  contracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  or\ncorruption is discovered. ADB\u2019s program for the PRC includes assistance to the Government\nthat will improve governance and provide incentives to reduce the incidence of corruption in the\nlonger  term.  In  1998,  ADB  approved  assistance  to  the  Government  to  develop  detailed", "21\nguidelines for selecting and engaging consultants,28 which increase transparency, take account\nof the principles of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, and provide for equal opportunity competition.\nThe  resulting  draft  guidelines  were  well  received  by  the  Government.  ADB  is  providing\nassistance to strengthen the Government\u2019s auditing system to conform with the requirements of\nthe Audit Law and, as far as practicable, international auditing standards by (i) formulating\ngovernment auditing standards and procedures, and (ii) designing and implementing an audit\ntraining program to promote full and consistent adherence to such auditing standards and\nprocedures by government auditors.29 This work will strengthen the Government\u2019s ability to\ndetect  fraud  and  corruption.  ADB  has  also  provided  assistance  for  establishing  national\nprocurement regulations, implementing the Tendering and Bidding Law and related regulations,\nand formulating the Government Procurement Law.30 These laws and regulations will help\nensure transparency in the procurement process and reduce corruption. In line with these\nnational developments, the PMO and subproject enterprises have established an anticorruption\nsystem by preparing specific programs and targets, agreeing to establish an internal audit unit,\nand organizing training and workshops.\n7. Disbursement\n70. Proceeds of the loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s standard disbursement\nprocedures.  To  facilitate  disbursement  related  to  numerous  small  expenditures  involved  in\nimplementing the subprojects, an imprest account will be established after loan effectiveness in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Appropriate withdrawal applications and\ndocumentation for liquidation of advance expenditures will support disbursements from the\nimprest account. Such documentation will show, among other things, that (i) goods imported\nwere produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, and (ii) only eligible items were\nimported or purchased locally. The initial amount deposited in the imprest account will be up to\n$1.4 million. Liquidation of expenditures will be supported with full documentation. Statement of\nexpenditures may be used for reimbursement procedures and for liquidating expenditures from\nthe imprest account valued at $100,000 equivalent or less.\n8. Human Resource Development\n71. The management and staff of the enterprises will be trained in functional areas such as\nsubproject  management,  environmental  protection  and  pollution  control,  environmental\nmonitoring. About 500 staff will receive substantial in-country and international training in the\nrelevant  managerial  skills,  accounting,  information  technology,  technical  processes,  quality\ncontrol,  automation,  plant  operation,  energy  management,  environmental  protection,  and\npollution control monitoring.  The enterprises will prepare a training program and submit it to\nADB for approval after procurement has been completed and the training arrangements with\nengineering contractors have been made, but not later than six months of loan effectiveness.\nThe PIAs will ensure that the recipients of international training financed under the Project\ncontinue their services with their respective subprojects for at least one year after training. The\ntraining programs will focus on accounts and financial reporting, enterprise management, sales\nand marketing, product development, market research, and similar areas. Key executives of the\nagencies will be exposed to updated management tools and techniques to be able to respond to\n                  \n28 TA 3138-PRC: Regulatory Framework for the Engagement of Consultants, for $700,000, approved on 22\nDecember 1998.\n29 TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1998.\n30 TA 3457-PRC: Implementation of the Tendering and Bidding Law and Related Regulations, for $565,000, approved\non 14 June 2000; TA 3631-PRC: Formulation of the Government Procurement Law, for $525,000, approved on 20\nFebruary 2001; TA 2845-PRC: Establishment of National Procurement Regulation for the Public Sector, for\n$565,000, approved on 20 August 1997.", "22\nthe rapidly changing demands of the marketplace. Provision has been made for computer-\nbased training and acquiring appropriate software.\n9. Progress Review\n72. The Project will be supervised through regular ADB missions. ADB will also monitor\nimplementation of all project components through the quarterly progress reports. Starting from\nthe first quarter after loan effectiveness, the enterprises will submit to ADB, within one month\nafter  the  completion  of  each  quarter,  quarterly  progress  reports  on  implementation  of  the\nsubprojects. The reports will indicate (i) the financial status of the subprojects; (ii) progress\nmade and problems encountered by the PIAs during the period under review; (iii) steps taken or\nproposed to remedy any problems; (iv) the status of implementation and compliance with loan\ncovenants,  including  enterprise  reforms  and  environmental  mitigation  and  control;\n(v) socioeconomic  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation,  including  mitigation  measures\nparticularly labor retrenchment and resettlement; and (vi) a proposed program of activities and\nexpected progress of subproject implementation during the following quarter. The EA and the\nPIAs, through the PMO, will furnish ADB with completion reports within six months after the loan\nclosure.  The implementation completion report will review the planned objectives and the\nachievements of the Project, including costs and benefits, and performance and contribution of\nall parties associated with project execution.\n73. During  implementation,  project  performance,  including  the  achievement  of  project\noutputs  and  attainment  of  development  and  environment  improvement  objectives,  will  be\nmonitored through the use of annual monitoring reports prepared by PMO.  The first annual\nmonitoring report will be submitted by December 2003, and the last by December 2005 or at a\nlater date depending on actual project completion.  In addition to the normal periodic reviews,\nADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review two years after implementation\nbegins. This review will include a detailed evaluation of the project scope, implementation\narrangements,  enterprise  reform,  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  labor  retrenchment,\nconsultation with affected persons, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the\nagenda for policy reforms and capacity-building measures.\n10. Project Performance Management System\n74. To assess the contribution of the subprojects to environmental improvement, APG will\nprovide an annual project performance report to ADB for five consecutive years after the project\nfacilities are commissioned. The first such report will be submitted within six months after loan\nclosure. The report will be based on individual project performance reports prepared by each\nPIA, which will assess the actual environmental improvements achieved as compared with the\ntargets.  The  assessments  will  measure  parameters  such  as  improvement  in  operational\nefficiency, managerial strength, and reduction in material and energy consumption and air\npollution, all against baseline data. The report will assess the achievement in each enterprise\nagainst the PRC's emissions and air quality standards. The report will include a summary of the\nreduction in the emissions attributable to the Project, and a summary of the status of Anhui\u2019s\nenvironmental protection plan.\n75. Socioeconomic changes that are likely to occur among the beneficiary population as a\nresult of the Project will be monitored by APG in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Project\nPerformance Management System. At the beginning of project implementation, APG, through\nindividual  reports  prepared  by  the  PIAs  will  provide  ADB  with  a  report  on  benchmark\ninformation. The benchmark information will contain relevant baseline information on income", "23\nand  expenditure  patterns,  relevant  indicators  pertaining  to  health,  agriculture,  forestry,\nemployment, and perceived improvements in the environment. The information will come from\nsurveys  and  data  from  primary  and  secondary  sources.  Repeat  sample  surveys  will  be\nconducted  during  project  implementation  and  upon  project  completion  to  measure  these\nimpacts.  With  this  information,  APG  will  prepare  a  comprehensive  report  on  the  poverty\nreduction impacts of the Project and submit it to ADB within six months after loan closure. APG\nwill also monitor and evaluate the impacts on retrenched workers and persons affected by\nresettlement and land acquisition as outlined in the labor retrenchment and resettlement plans.\nSpecial attention will be given to the socioeconomic conditions (including income, employment,\nhealth, and education) of affected persons dissagregated by gender. The data will be part of all\nreports that APG will submit to ADB.\nF. The Executing Agency\n1. Organization and Management\n76. APG will be the EA for the Project. The Project will be coordinated through the existing\nADB PMO, which has performed satisfactorily for the ongoing Loans 1490/91 (footnote 18):\nAnhui Environmental Improvement Project for Municipal Wastewater Treatment and Industrial\nPollution Abatement. To ensure strong coordination, a steering committee under the direct\nsupervision of the provincial vice-governor has been established. The PMO will function as the\nsecretariat  to  the  EA  and  steering  committee,  and  will  maintain  records  of  discussions,\ndecisions made, and actions taken, in addition to implementing the institutional strengthening\ncomponent.\n77. The six CP and the three EI-ARD enterprises will be the PIAs for their respective\nsubprojects, with responsibility for day-to-day implementation of activities. The PMO will be the\nPIA for institutional strengthening of government agencies. All PIAs enterprise have begun\nrestructuring in varying degrees. Differences exist among the PIAs enterprise in the extent of\nthe formal reform path traveled, as well as the speed of the emergence of a market-based\ncorporate  culture,  and  adoption  of  modern  management  practices.  ATC,  one  of  six  PIAs\nenterprise, has adopted a corporate form of LLSC with shares listed on the Shenzhen Stock\nExchange. It employs 2,664 workers and is one of the largest enterprises in Tongling County.\nThe other five PIAs have established LLCs with the goal of converting to LLSCs in the future.\nCNM and WHC currently employ 1,594 and 4,000 people, respectively. Three of six PIAs,\nnamely, ATC, CNM, and WHC, are part of group company structures. The majority of the\nshares of both ATC and WHC belong to a group company, while CNM is a group company in\nitself. WFW and WSC employ 346 and 1,080 people respectively. They are located in Wuhu\nCity Economic and Technology Development Zone. WZM has a workforce of 4,247. The three\nEI-ARDE enterprises\u2014HEC, HWC, and JTC\u2014are operating as 100 percent state-owned LLCs.\nJTC is a state-owned LLC that employs 512 people.\n2. Past Performance and Financial Projections\n78. Some common characteristics of CP enterprises are (i) low profitability and liquidity,\n(ii) high level of inventory and receivables, (iii) high level of short-term debts, and (iv) lack of\nknowledge of and expertise in modern enterprise management. Five of the six CP enterprises\nhave  recorded  generally  poor  financial  performance  in  the  past  few  years.  The  physical\nconditions of existing machinery and equipment are poor, technology used is obsolete, and\nenterprises have not been operating at full capacity.  Material wastage has been high and\nenergy  efficiency  has  been  low.  Managerial  weaknesses  along  with  obsolete  technology,", "24\nequipment, and other obstacles have resulted in high production costs, low sales, and low profit\nmargins for these enterprises.\n79. To ensure financial viability, all six enterprises will undertake measures to improve their\noperational and organizational structures, as agreed upon during the policy dialogue during\nproject  processing.  The  measures  are  included  in  the  restructuring  action  plans  of  the\nenterprises:  equity  infusion;  separation  of  noncore  activities;  preventing  income  transfer  to\nrelated companies; reducing inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable turnover\ndays; debt repayment; and establishment of different control mechanisms at the management\nlevel. To this end, the subproject enterprises have agreed to give priority to developing the\nmanagement by training the board members and management to carry out the appropriate\nrestructuring  effort.  Details  on  enterprise  reforms  and  restructuring  activities  are  given  in\nAppendix 3. This restructuring, combined with the reduced operating costs resulting from the\ninvestment under the Project, will help make enterprises sustainable.\n80. As a result of enterprise restructuring and project investments, the financial performance\nof the six CP enterprises is expected to recover during the next five years. It is then expected to\nprogressively improve as production levels and sales volumes increase and unit production cost\ndecreases with the start of the operations of the subprojects. To ensure their overall financial\nsoundness, each enterprise will maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of not more than 70:30, a current\nratio of not less than 1.0, and a debt-service ratio of not less than 1.0 from the effective date of\nthe loan agreement up to the first principal repayment date and not less than 1.3 thereafter. To\nensure that all CP enterprises can meet these requirements, shareholders of four of the six CP\nenterprises will provide the following equity infusions: WHC, Y150 million; WFW, Y100 million;\nWSC, Y147 million; and WZM, Y227 million. Part of these equity infusions will pay for the long-\nterm debts for WHC (Y70 million) and WZM (Y6 million). For CNM, Y25 million additional cash\nwill be obtained by selling the present site and using the proceeds for debt payment. CNM will\ntransfer Y10 million debt to the Kewei Non-ferrous Metal Company since this debt was originally\ntaken for this subsidiary.  Based on these conditions and requirements, financial projections\nwere made up to 2010. Table 4 summarizes the key financial indicators in 2010 compared with\nthose in 2000.\nTable 4: Financial Indicators of Subproject Enterprises, 2000 and 2010\n2000 2010\nDebt-to Debt Service Debt-to- Debt Service\nEnter- Gross Operating Current -Equity Coverage Gross Operating Current Equity Coverage\nprise Margin Margin Ratio Ratio Ratio Margin Margin Ratio Ratio Ratio\nATC 19.7 14.3 2.3 23:77 7.2 17.8 12.8 5.4 7:93 3.8\nCNM 9.3 6.3 1.0 63:37 2.5 12.8 10.5 5.3 11:89 3.3\nWFW 10.3 2.8 3.2 15:85 74.0 22.0 19.7 4.0 21:79 2.3\nWHC 8.4 5.5 0.9 64:36 1.5 13.5 11.0 6.3 11:89 5.0\nWSC 13.7 3.6 2.1 49:51 3.6 38.6 32.8 11.7 15:85 3.5\nWZM 12.0 1.1 0.9 30:70 1.7 13.3 7.8 1.7 14:86 2.1\nHEC 10.2 (1.7) 1.3 30:70 2.5 25.3 18.6 2.9 33:67 1.3\nHWC 23.8 (19.2) 1.5 25:75 1.0 56.3 48.8 7.7 30:70 1.3\nJTC 55.6 25.7 1.4 17:83 10.9 48.1 27.5 5.1 21:79 3.5\nCurrent ratio = current assets/current liabilities; debt service coverage ratio = net cash flow operations/debt service\nrepayments; debt: equity ratio = (short term debt +  current portion of long term debt + long term debt/total equity); gross\nmargin % sales = gross margin/net sales; operating margin % sales = operating profit /net sales.\n81. JTC, one of three EI-ARD enterprises, recorded good financial performance in the past\nfew years. The two other EI-ARD subproject enterprises\u2013HEC and HWC\u2013recorded losses.\nElectricity, water, and wastewater tariffs and entrance fees for HEC, HWC, and JTC were", "25\nprojected to generate sufficient revenues to cover operating and maintenance costs, interest\ncharges, and depreciation related to the subproject facilities by the first year of operation. Both\nHWC and JTC will apply a one-time connection fee for new water customers. The water tariffs\nfor HWC will increase by 3 percent per annum based on revenue requirements between 2002\nand 2010. In the case of JTC, revenues from water tariffs and other charges were forecast to\nincrease by 6 percent.  The wastewater tariffs for JTC and HWC are based on 80 percent of\nmetered water consumption. The number of visitors for JTC was projected to increase by 3\npercent  annually  between  2001  and  2010.  Revenues  from  visitors  will  cover  the  cost  of\noperations.\n82. The  financial  projections  for  the  EI-ARD  enterprises  show  that  they  can  generate\nadequate revenues to cover operating costs and debt service obligations. The realization of\nprojected revenues for HEC and HWC subprojects depend on raising the tariffs and equity\ninfusions. HEC and HWC will provide additional equity infusions, Y47 million and Y70 million,\nrespectively, during the construction period. During the policy dialogue, it was agreed that HTC\nwill provide Y154.5 million funds to HEC (Y62.5 million) and HWC (Y92 million) from 2006 to\n2010. With the tariff adjustments and equity infusions, all three EI-ARD projects will be able to\nmaintain debt-service coverage ratios above 1.3 from 1 January 2006 onwards (Table 4 and\nAppendix 10).\n83. To  monitor  the  overall  financial  soundness  of  the  enterprises,  each  enterprise  will\nprepare annual financial statements consisting of income statements, sources and application of\nfunds, and balance sheets. Each enterprise will have financial statements audited in accordance\nwith internationally accepted auditing standards by external auditors acceptable to ADB, and will\nsubmit to ADB not later than six months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of\nfinancial  statements,  audited  accounts,  and  auditor\u2019s  report  in  English.  During  processing,\nADB\u2019s guidelines for preparing and submitting audited financial statements and accounts were\nexplained to the PIAs, and timely submission of audited financial statements and accounts and\nsanctions for failure to do so were emphasized. In particular, the following consequences for\nnoncompliance were highlighted: (i) suspension of disbursements, new contract awards and\nimprest account replenishments if compliance is delayed by more than 6 months; and (ii)\nsuspension of the loan if compliance is delayed by more than 12 months.\nG. Environmental and Social Dimensions\n1.  Environment\n84. The Project will yield large environmental benefits, but some of the subprojects will have\nnegative impacts. Therefore, the Project is classified as environment-sensitive category B. An\ninitial environmental examination (IEE) for the Project and IEE for each subproject have been\nprepared. A summary IEE highlighting the main findings and mitigation measures and the\nenvironmental management and monitoring plan were circulated to the Board on 1 August\n2001. Appendix 11 shows the major environmental benefits associated with the Project.\n85. The Project will reduce acid rain, improve environmental quality, and abate pollution in\nthe workplace through CP promotion, improved energy efficiency, and waste minimization. The\ntotal amount of SO  reduction due to the Project is about 31,332 t/yr (44 percent reduction in\n2\nurban  areas).  The  Project  will  also  reduce  coal  consumption  by  162,457  t/yr.  Wastewater\ntreated will be 15 million tons per year including a reduction in COD by 2,472 t/yr. SO reduction\n2 \nin Chizhou, Tongling, and Wuhu cities with the Project will be 59 percent, 38 percent, and 46\npercent, respectively. While there is little quantitative study on the correlation between air quality", "26\nand health damage for workers, morbidity and mortality from lung cancer and other respiratory\ndiseases are higher than the national averages for workers in these enterprises and residents\nliving in the vicinity. Reduced acid rain and improved environmental quality will reduce damage\nto infrastructure and ecosystems, improve human health, and boost agricultural and forestry\nproductivity. Abatement of pollution in the workplace will reduce damage to workers\u2019 health,\nimprove  working  conditions,  and  enhance  labor  productivity.  The  Project  will  also  support\nenvironmental  improvement  activities,  including  rehabilitating  damage  due  to  acid  rain  in\necologically  protected  areas.  Investments  on  the  institutional  strengthening  component  will\nenhance  the  capacity  to  manage  the  environment  and  monitor  provincial  and  local\nenvironmental agencies.\n86. Adverse environmental impacts from each subproject will be minimized by selecting the\ntechnology and appropriate mitigation measures identified in the environmental assessment\nreports.  Potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  include  those  related  to  air  pollution,\ndegradation of water quality, noise pollution, solid waste, and effects on plants and wildlife. In\neach case, the impact and the receptors (affected people, ecosystems) were studied. Wherever\nadverse impacts were identified, mitigation measures were specified. APG has assured that the\nenvironmental mitigation measures identified in the IEEs/EIAs and the summary IEE will be\nincorporated in the design, construction, and operation stages of the Project. Environmental\nmeasures,  on  which  action  needs  to  be  taken  by  contractors,  will  be  incorporated  in  the\ncontracts for civil works. During the construction period, PMO/APG through their PIOs in the\ncities will supervise and monitor contractor compliance with the requirements for environmental\nprotection, and implementation of the environmental management and monitoring plan by PIAs.\n2. Social Dimensions\n87. A social assessment and poverty impact analysis were undertaken in the project area\nduring  project  preparation.  Beneficiary  and  stakeholder  participation  was  sought  through\nappropriate  participatory  approaches.  Results  indicate  that  the  Project  will  have  significant\npositive social benefits for the target population. The local communities give high priority to the\nProject. A special study to address gender concerns related to environmental awareness was\nundertaken.31 Overall, the Project requires the permanent acquisition of about 20.3 hectares\n(ha). This includes 8 ha and 8.5 ha to relocate Wuhu Feiying Wood Chemicals and Chizhou\nNon-Ferrous Metals respectively, to an industrial zone. The 16.5 ha in the industrial zone is\nvacant and does not need to be resettled. The remainder (3.8 ha) will be acquired by the Jiuhua\nsubproject for water supply, wastewater and solid waste treatment. Land acquisition in Jiuhua\nwill affect 23 households farming 1.3 ha of paddy. The affected households will be relocated,\ngiven  cash  compensation,  and  provided  livelihood  support  according  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  on\ninvoluntary resettlement and PRC\u2019s Land Administration Law, 1998. A summary of the short\nresettlement plan is in Appendix 12.\n88. Although  the  Project  will  generate  direct,  indirect,  and  temporary  employment\nopportunities, it can also result in some loss of employment due to enterprise restructuring. For\nexample, enterprise restructuring in ATC, CNM, WFW, WSC, WZM, and JTC is expected to\ninvolve the retrenchment of about 840 workers. Of these, about 800 will be redeployed and the\nrest will be given early retirement benefits consisting of 80 percent of their current salary for five\nyears. PIAs will prepare labor retrenchment plans for affected persons. Each plan will include\n                  \n31 The special study was undertaken as part of TA 5889-REG: Gender and Development, for $850,000, approved on\n23 December 1999. Relevant findings regarding the need for environmental awareness campaigns for indoor\npollution and the need to monitor impacts on women have been incorporated in the project design.", "27\nmechanisms for redeployment and early retirement. It will also have special sections dealing\nwith (i) low-income persons with alternative livelihood options, and (ii) women workers.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n89. Financial analysis was conducted on an incremental basis in constant 2001 prices using\na 20-year economic life for the subprojects. The values of all inputs and outputs were based on\nprevailing  market  prices.  With-subproject  and  without-subproject  financial  projections  were\nprepared for each industrial enterprise. The differences between the two projections were used\nto determine the subproject\u2019s financial viability.\n90. For the six CP subprojects, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) ranges from 6.3\npercent to 13.6 percent, all of which exceed the respective real weighted average costs of\ncapital  (WACC)  (Appendix  13).  Sensitivity  analysis  confirms  that  the  FIRRs  are  generally\nadequate, although certain adverse scenarios cause the FIRRs to be lower than WACCs (Table\n5).  There  are  sensitivities  particularly  to  changes  in  output  price.  However,  conservative\nassumptions on capacity utilization and output prices were used in the base case (Appendix\n13). In some cases, the rate of capacity utilization assumed was only 60-70 percent.  The FIRRs\nfor  the  three  EI-ARD  subprojects  range  from  7.3  to  10.0  percent.  The  potential  risk  and\nmitigation measures related to the financial performance of subprojects were discussed during\npolicy dialogue.\nTable 5: FIRR Sensitivity Analysis\n(percent)\nCase Variation ATC CNM WFW WHC WSC WZM HEC HWC JTC\nBase Case 6.3 13.6 7.7 9.1 10.6 9.8 10.0 9.2 7.3\nCapital Cost +10% 5.4 12.4 6.7 8.0 9.3 8.7 8.7 7.8 6.1\nOutput Price -10% 2.7 7.3 4.1 4.8 8.8     3.5 6.9 8.7 4.6\nInput Price +10% 3.7 8.9 5.6 6.1 10.1 4.9 9.8 9.2 7.2\nOne-Year Delay 5.3 11.8 6.4 4.9 8.8 8.4 8.8 8.4 6.4\nWeighted Average Cost of\nCapital (Real Terms) 4.4 4.6 5.0 6.0 5.5 4.9 5.1 5.1 4.4\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, ATC = Anhui Tongdu Copper Limited Company, CNM = Chizhou Non-Ferrous Metals Group\nCompany, WFW = Wuhu Feiying Wood Chemicals Limited Company, WHC = Wuhu Hengchang Copper Refinery Company, WSC =\nWuhu Shanjiang Chemicals Limited Company, WZM = Wuhu Zhengxing Materials Limited Company, HEC = Huangshan Electric\nCompany, HWC = Huangshan Water Company, JTC = Jiuhua Tourism Group Company\n91. The economic analysis of the subprojects was carried out on an incremental basis. The\nquantifiable  economic  benefits  attributable  to  the  six  CP  subprojects  include  (i) energy\nconservation  through  the  adoption  of  CP  technology;  (ii)  enhanced  efficiency  and  cost-\neffectiveness of production through operational modifications; and (iii) improved product quality\nwith introduction of CP technology, process improvements, and raw materials substitution. The\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculations do not include quantified environmental\nbenefits.  The  EIRR  for  the  whole  Project  is  20.4  percent.  The  EIRRs  for  CP  subproject\ninvestments range from 14.2 to 27.5 percent. The EIRRs for the three EI-ARD subproject\ninvestments range from 19.7 to 23.9 percent. These figures are summarized in Table 6; details\nare in Appendix 14. A sensitivity analysis was carried out for increased capital cost, increased\noperation and maintenance cost, decreased benefits, and construction delay. The analysis\nshows that the Project is resilient under adverse conditions.

Environment\n92. Air  pollutants  such  as  particulate  matter,  SO ,  and  NO   have  adverse  effects\u2014\n2 2\nrespiratory morbidity and related mortality\u2014on human health. Acute symptoms of particulate\nand SO pollution include restricted activity, respiratory illnesses, and exacerbation of asthma\n2 \nand chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chronic particulate and SO pollution is associated\n2 \nwith bronchitis, chronic cough, respiratory illness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and\naggravated asthma, decreased longevity, and lung cancer. Children, the elderly, and persons\nwith asthma and cardiovascular disease are most susceptible to SO  exposure.32 The Project\n2\nwill substantially reduce the emissions of toxic gases and other airborne particulate associated\nwith acid rain, wastewater, and other hazardous wastes. There are many other benefits, such as\nreductions in release of arsenic, lead, nickel, copper, formaldehyde, methanol, cyanide, and\ncarbon monoxide. In addition, there will be reductions to the contaminant load of the Yangtze\nRiver and its tributaries. The resultant improvement in air and ambient water quality will improve\npublic health. Ancillary benefits of the improved technological process include improvements in\nthe urban water supply that will benefit public health and reduce the costs of urban water\ntreatment.\n93. Since the Project area lies in a river valley, environmental improvement will benefit the\nlocal population directly. The Project\u2019s environmental benefits have been quantified. The main\nquantifiable  environmental  benefits  are  those  associated  with  the  significant  reductions  in\nemissions (SO , TSP, and NO ) causing acid rain and reductions in industrial wastewater\n2 X\ndischarges; improvements in air quality at the facilities due to CP technology and process\nchanges; and global or transboundary benefits from reduced emissions of CO  The Project can\n2.\ngenerate the following benefits: (i) reduced mortality in sensitive populations (asthmatics and\nothers with preexisting respiratory diseases); (ii) reduced morbidity among all residents (with\ncorresponding increases in productivity and reduced expenditure on both medical care and\nmitigation); (iii) increased opportunity for outdoor activities that are sensitive to ambient air\nquality (recreation and some productive enterprises); and (iv) greater potential to attract clean\n                  \n32 A Beijing study showed that mortality rate increased by 11 percent for every doubling in SO concentration. A\n2\nsimilar study in Shenyang concluded that for every 100 micrograms per cubic meter increase in SO , mortality\n2\nincreased by 2.4 percent. NO in the air forms nitrogenated organic compounds, which have been shown to be\n2 \nmutagenic and carcinogenic. NO suppresses the immune system.\n2 ", "29\nindustries into the area (tourism as well as knowledge-based industries), thereby enhancing the\ncities\u2019 development potential.\nC. Social Impacts\n94. The Project will benefit residents through improved health\u2014lower number of restricted\nactivity days, reduced medical expenses, and lower mortality\u2014which have higher impacts on\nthe poor because they have higher health costs relative to their income. An estimated 1.65\nmillion33 people will experience improved health from the Project. Children, the elderly, and\nthose with asthma and cardiovascular diseases will have the highest health benefit due to their\nsusceptibility to air pollution. Health benefits accruing to the 9,700 enterprise workers, of whom\n10 percent are classified as unskilled and receive low incomes, will also be higher due to the\npoor environmental working conditions currently existing in the enterprises.\n95. Gender assessment shows that the Project will have beneficial impacts on women. A\npublic awareness campaign will specifically target women in creating environmental awareness.\nEnterprises have indicated that at least 30 percent of new staff positions will be for women. The\nProject will ensure that women are adequately represented in the various capacity building and\ntraining programs. The Project will also result in increased agricultural and forestry productivity,\nsectors that constitute the main source of income for the rural poor. Awareness that air pollution\nis a major problem that results in poor resource productivity is high.  Medical expenses for\npollution- related diseases, and household-based preventive measures and repairs to avert\nadverse environmental impacts have been rising. However, there is limited knowledge of acid\nrain, and this results in a relatively low willingness to pay. This points to the need for raising\nenvironmental awareness to improve the absorptive capacity of the target population.\nD. Poverty Reduction Impacts\n96. Reduced acid rain and environmental improvement will benefit all persons in the project\narea regardless of income levels. Acid rain reduction and environmental improvement are quasi-\npublic goods in the sense that beneficiaries will not be charged fees, nor do they need to invest\nin infrastructure to receive benefits (as in the case of utilities). In this respect, the Project allows\nthe poor to derive the same benefits as for the non-poor, if not higher. The Project will contribute\nto poverty reduction through (i) health benefits from air pollution reduction and environmental\nimprovement for the poor residing near the enterprises, and health benefits from improved\nworking conditions for enterprise workers; (ii) increased incomes from higher agricultural and\nforestry  productivity  due  to  reduced  acid  rain;  and  (iii)  added  employment  opportunities.\nPotential benefits for enterprise workers are greatly improved working conditions. Of the 9,700\nenterprise workers directly affected by the CP subproject investments, over 1,000 are unskilled\nand receive low income. Water supply and wastewater treatment will provide clean drinking\nwater to 12,000 rural persons that currently have no access to piped water, and remove the\nthreat to main water intakes of Wuhu City\u2014which serves 180,000 persons. Promoting economic\ngrowth through investment on CP, technology transfer, and environmental cleanup will further\ncontribute to poverty reduction.\n97. The Project will improve crop and forestry productivity for a good proportion of the\nproject area\u2019s agricultural population that number more than 13 million, of whom 408,000 have\nannual incomes of less than Y1,000 per capita. Improved agricultural and forestry productivity\nwill help the rural poor generate more income. A significant number of the beneficiaries are from\n                  \n33Based on the derivation of underlying receptor populations for regional damage areas (within 80 km).", "30\nlow-income households, and the Project will have positive impacts on poor individuals because\nlabor (influenced by health) and agricultural productivity are their most important resources. The\nProject will result in full-time employment for 400 within the subprojects; full-time employment\nfor 2,500 in related industries; and temporary construction employment of 7,000 person-years.\nOf the temporary employment, 70 percent will be for unskilled workers. These jobs can provide\nsupplementary income for the poor.\nE. Risks\n98. The main risks include (i) failure on the part of APG and the subproject enterprises to\ncontinue to implement environmental improvement and enterprise restructuring measures; and\n(ii) timely availability of domestic counterpart funding. The risk from item (i) will depend on\nAPG\u2019s and subproject enterprises\u2019 continuing implementation of policy and institutional reforms\nwith respect to environmental improvement, and undertaking required enterprise restructuring\nprocesses. Addressing the potential risks associated with (i) was a major element of ADB\u2019s\npolicy  dialogue  during  project  processing.  Although  APG  and  subproject  enterprises  have\nshown strong commitment to continue implementation of these measures, there may be delays\nin implementation.  The delay could be due to several factors such as lack of resources, laws,\nimplementation  capabilities,  or  technical  expertise.  These  factors  were  carefully  assessed\nduring  project  processing,  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures  including  suitable  legal\ncovenants were incorporated in the project design. Previous experience in similar ADB projects\nin Anhui Province shows that ADB\u2019s continued dialogue and persuasion can reduce this risk\nsubstantially. ADB will continue to discuss policy concerns and action required during project\nimplementation. There will be review missions and consulting services to advise APG on project\nimplementation,  policy  issues,  and  institutional  strengthening  aspects  during  project\nimplementation. Institutional strengthening measures built into the project design are related to\nmanagement expertise, training, financial autonomy, and other corporate governance issues to\nhelp the subproject enterprises address these issues. These measures will minimize the risk.\n99. Timely availability of domestic resources has been a constraint in some subprojects in\nprevious ADB-supported projects involving enterprises. The difficulty reflects a tightening of\ncommercial bank credit resulting from ongoing reforms that call for lending based solely on\ncommercial  considerations.  Each  enterprise  has  provided  firm  cofinancing  commitments\n(domestic loans, equity contribution, and other financing sources) for the relevant subprojects to\nADB\u2019s satisfaction. Further specific assurances that have been included require APG to provide\nadequate local currency funding to make up for any shortfall in cofinancing, without causing any\ndelay in loan disbursement and project implementation. Each subproject will be required to have\nin place satisfactory cofinancing or alternative arrangements for agreed-upon amounts as a\ncondition for disbursing loan funds.\n100. Even if the subprojects are well-managed and market pricing is maintained, weaknesses\nin the management and governance of the subproject enterprises may create inefficiencies.\nDuring  policy  dialogue,  these  risks  were  discussed,  and  it  was  agreed  that  enterprise\ngovernance would be given high priority in subproject management. This risk will be minimized\nthrough (i) the provision of management training, (ii) increased management independence, (iii)\nintroduction of better incentive systems, and (iv) increased managerial accountability. Variations\nin market-determined pricing for inputs and outputs, and frequent movements in market demand\nare also major commercial risks associated with the Project. As reflected in some adverse\nscenarios in the financial analysis, the recalculated FIRRs can go below the WACCs of some\nsubprojects.    Such  a  risk  was  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  subproject  enterprises  and\nmitigation measures were discussed in detail during ADB\u2019s policy dialogue. The measures", "31\ninclude both short- and long-term strategies. The short-term strategies include (i) reducing the\ninventory period to improve liquidity, (ii) strengthening marketing activities to increase sales\nvolume, (iii) improving operation and maintenance to reduce cost of sales, (iv) timely transport\nof inputs and outputs, and (v) purchasing insurance policies to cover price fluctuations. The\nlong-term strategies include (i) purchasing derivative instruments including forward contracts,\noption contracts, and cap and floor agreements, where applicable; (ii) long-term raw material\nsupply contracts for stable supply; and (iii) long-term sales and purchase with agreed-upon\npricing formulas. Cash deficiency supports will also be available from parent companies or\nstakeholders.\n101. Cost  overruns  and  delays  in  implementation  also  constitute  a  potential  risk  for  the\nsubprojects. To minimize these risks, the project design incorporated appropriate precautions\nand  strategies  such  as  (i)  ensuring  enterprise  competitiveness  in  the  PRC's  increasingly\nliberalized policy regime and market economy; (ii)  restructuring existing enterprises to ensure a\nsound financial status; (iii) using technically and commercially proven technology; (iv) using\ninternationally reputable and reliable contractors and suppliers; (v) making lump-sum turnkey\ncontracts,  where  applicable;  (vi)  obtaining  performance  guarantees  from  contractors  and\nsuppliers; (vii) obtaining process guarantees from licensers, where applicable; (viii) stipulating\nliquidity damage provision in contracts; (ix) strengthening enterprise management systems and\ninformation technology (IT) approaches; and (x) purchasing various insurance policies such as\nbusiness interruption insurance.\n102. Another potential performance risk is that targeted environmental improvements may not\nbe achieved because of lack of experience in the revised plant design, and proper operation\nand management. To minimize this risk, an institutional strengthening component is included in\nthe Project. The use of internationally experienced consulting firms will assure the smooth\nimplementation  of  the  institutional  strengthening  component.  The  PlAs  and  their  design\nconsultants will develop the performance specifications and criteria. The technical specifications\nfor  the  major  processes  and  equipment  will  be  prepared  by  the  prequalified  bidders  and\nincorporated in ICB packages for compliance by the manufacturers. In this manner, a single\nparty/manufacturer/ supplier will be responsible for the performance, design, and guarantees of\nthe processes and the quantity and quality of the product. These strategies will reduce the\npotential risk to acceptable levels.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n103.

Anhui  Province  has  achieved  progress  in  controlling  air  pollution  primarily  by\nimplementing  key  policies,  such  as  (i)  limiting  the  consumption  of  high-sulfur  coal,\n(ii) rationalizing  industry  structures  and  closure  of  small  highly  polluting  enterprises,\n(iii) tightening  enforcement  of  standards,  (iv)  renovating  boilers  and  improving  the  urban\nenvironment, and (v) strengthening urban infrastructure and promoting clean energy. Despite\nthese  programs,  sulfur  dioxide  (SO )  emissions  remain  high  and  acid  rain  is  frequent.  In\n2\nresponse to this issue, the province has prepared the Anhui Acid Rain Control Region 10th Five\nYear Plan for SO  Pollution Control.\n2\n2. The  plan  covers  six  cities:  Chaohu,  Huangshan,  Maanshan,  Tongling,  Wuhu,  and\nXuancheng for the period 2001-2005. The main objective is to reduce SO  concentrations in the\n2\nsix cities and to reach Class II ambient air levels. Projections show that during the Tenth Five-\nYear Plan (10FYP) period, the increase in SO  emissions will be about 29,000 tons if no control\n2\nis practiced. The increase will primarily be from the increased consumption of coal for fuel. The\n10FYP\u2019s goal is a 20 percent reduction of SO  from the 2000 levels in the acid rain and SO\n2 2\ncontrol zone. This highlights the importance of the plan in meeting the 10FYP objectives. Table\nA2.1 gives the main components of the plan.\nTable A2.1: Integrated Prevention and Control Plan on SO  and Acid Rain\n2\nMain Component Items\n1. Control SO  emissions from  i. Restrict SO  emissions from industrial sources\n2 2\nindustrial enterprises ii. Restrict SO  emission from thermal power plants\n2\niii. Promote cleaner production to control SO  pollution\n2\niv.Limit SO  emission from industrial stoves and kilns\n2\nv. Reduce SO  emissions in 13 key industrial enterprises\n2\n2. Reduce sulfur content in coal  i. Restrict high sulfur coal mining\nmines\n3. Strengthen urban energy  i. Rationalize urban energy infrastructure distribution\ninfrastructure construction ii. Improve energy use in Huangshan\n4. Supervision, management, and  i. Coordinate provincial and local environment protection bureau \ninsurance measures (EPB)  planning\nii.

Strengthen scientific research  i. Establish air pollution, and acid rain monitoring network\nmonitoring, supervision. and  ii. Support environment research programs\nmanagement\n3. The plan lists 21 projects with a total investment of Y5.4 billion ($650 million). These\nprojects can reduce SO  emission by 58,500 tons per year, which is over 90 percent of potential\n2\nSO  reduction in the six cities.

Organizational Restructuring\n1. To  benefit  from  the  knowledge  and  experience  of  cross-industrial  and  regional  board\nmembers, all enterprises will be appointed at least one representative from a financial institution. To\navoid conflict of interest, the representative will be selected from a financial institution (excluding\nprovincial or national finance bureaus), which is not a lender to the enterprise. The board members\nwill be trained to understand not only, the company\u2019s financial results but also outside benchmarks.\nTo comply with the Company Law, all enterprises will appoint a member who will represent company\nworkers on the board. Currently, workers are not represented on the boards of enterprises.\n2. Within  the  existing  organizational  structure,  both  the  financial  and  marketing/sales\ndepartments are weak in all industrial enterprises.  Some financial departments have accountants\ntotally dependent on manual counting practices and without the benefit of information technology.\nThere  is  ample  opportunity  for  the  marketing  and  sales  departments  to  upgrade  their\nprofessionalism. Some enterprises do not have human resources departments. None of the six\ncleaner production (CP) enterprises has research and development (R&D) divisions. As a result of\nthe policy dialogue, it was agreed that each enterprise will provide an action plan that details future\nsteps  for  organizational  restructuring  by  the  end  of  six  months  from  loan  effectiveness.  The\nenterprise restructuring strategies for all enterprises will cover four key areas: (i) business strategy\nplans,  (ii)  corporate  governance,  (iii)  accounting  and  financial  reporting,  and  (iv) information\ntechnology upgrade. Twinning arrangements with domestic and international companies operating in\nthe same industry will play an important role in helping these enterprises absorb capability and keep\nup with the pace of recent technological developments.\n3. All CP enterprises have a performance evaluation system, but none of the enterprises have\nset up a compensation committee among the board members to determine the level of performance-\nbased bonuses. The nonexistence of a well-designed performance information system prevents the\nmanagement from objectively calculating and allocating performance incentives to employees. The\npolicy  dialogue  resulted  in  the  agreement  that  each  enterprise  will  establish  a  performance\nevaluation committee and performance information system that will enable management to rely on\nincentives to improve performance, and productivity and profitability.\nB. Financial Restructuring and Governance Improvements\n4. Financial restructuring will be applied through workout, distress mergers/acquisitions and\nbankruptcies, strategic investors; focusing enterprises on their core competencies through disposal\nof  nonviable  operations,  excess  assets  as  well  as  grouping  and  consolidation  of  sub-scale\noperations;  governance  improvements  through  modified  governance  arrangements  and\ndiversification; and other transformation of ownership changes. The Project will bring together debtor\nenterprises,  their  owners,  and  their  creditors  in  planning  and  agreeing  on  voluntary  financial\nworkouts.    This  will  also  provide  valuable  insights  for  broader  programs  of  corporate  workout\ninvolving the resolution of nonperforming bank loans.\n5. It was agreed that to ensure overall financial soundness, each enterprise will maintain a\ndebt-to-equity ratio of not more than 70:30, a current ratio of not less than 1.0, and a debt-service\nratio of not less than 1.0 from the effective date of loan agreement up to the first principal repayment\ndate  and  not  less  than  1.3  thereafter.    All  CP  enterprises  have  agreed  to  comply  with  these\nrequirements. To ensure that all CP enterprises can meet these requirements, shareholders of the\nfollowing CP enterprises will provide equity infusion as agreed upon during policy dialogue with\nADB: Wuhu Hengchang Copper Refinery Company (WHC), Y150 million; Wuhu Feiying Wood\nChemicals Limited Company (WFW), Y100 million; Wuhu Shanjiang Chemicals Limited Company", "42 Appendix 3, page 2\n(WSC), Y147 million; and Wuhu Zhengxing Materials Company Limited (WZM), Y227 million. WHC\nand  WZM  will  pay  their  long-term  debt  after  equity  infusion  of  Y70  million  and  Y6  million,\nrespectively. Chizhou Non-Ferrous Metals Group Company (CNM) will obtain Y25 million cash\nthrough the sale of the present site and the receipts will be used for debt payment. It was also\nagreed that CNM will transfer its Y10 million debt to Kewei Non-Ferrous Metal Company since this\ndebt was originally taken for this subsidiary.\n6. Anhui Tongdu Copper Limited Company (ATC) is a major shareholder in several joint-stock\ncompanies. As a result of the policy dialogue it was agreed that ATC will decrease its majority\nownership in these entities to less than 50 percent. Jiuhua Tourism Group Company (JTC) has\ncontracted its noncore businesses to Jiuhua Tourism Development Shareholding Company (JTDSC)\nwhere  JTC  holds  75  percent.  During  the  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue,  JTC  agreed  to  decrease  its\nownership in JTDSC to less than 50 percent. Diversification of the shareholding system is necessary\nto bring in new investors with capital, management know-how, technology, and access to wider\nmarkets, while the state\u2019s share is reduced. The gradual reduction of the state\u2019s share in enterprises\nwas also discussed and Government\u2019s agreement was obtained during the policy dialogue. As result\nof the policy dialogue, WFW, WZM, and ATC agreed that separation of noncore activities will be\ncompleted prior to loan disbursements.  WHC was a division of Wuhu Hengxin Copper limited\nliability company (LLC), which has numerous subcompanies and noncore activities. The policy\ndialogue led to the establishment of WHC as a new limited-liability company in June 2001.\n7. Adoption of prudent and more transparent management and reporting practices is necessary\nto  accurately  assess  the  future  financial  performance  of  enterprises.  The  Project  will  acquire\nadvisers to assess the needs of enterprises for efficient and transparent management reporting.\nBest practices will be reviewed to set up modern reporting techniques for these industries, not only\nthrough suitable software, but also with the purchase of appropriate hardware. The enterprises are\nurgently in need of computerization and proper training. Since all enterprises aim to become a\npublicly listed company in the future, Anhui provincial government (APG) and the enterprises agreed\nto adopt international accounting standards by 31 December 2003.  It was also agreed that all\nenterprises will develop company procedures and policies for credit and collection, purchasing,\nhuman resources, sales, and marketing.\n8. All  enterprises  are  required  to  improve  working  capital  requirements  such  as  inventory\nturnover from 221 days to 60 days, accounts receivable turnover from 124 days to 30 days and\naccounts payable from 165 days to 30 days.  To ensure management control of the activities of\nenterprises, it was agreed during the policy dialogue that an audit committee and a risk management\ncommittee will be established and internal auditors, financial controllers, and external auditors will be\nappointed. The accounting system must also be acceptable to ADB.\nC. Management Development\n9. To meet the requirements, it was agreed during the policy dialogue that all enterprises must\ngive priority to management development. Training the board, management, and the employees to\ncarry out the right restructuring efforts is a must. Workshops, mentoring programs, study tour\nprograms, twinning arrangements, and mini-master in business administrations (MBAs) are activities\nthat can be undertaken for management development. The restructuring modalities will be worked\nout jointly by managers and employees with a team of technical consultants to obtain ownership in\nthe design and execution of any restructuring plan.  In addition, proper performance evaluation,\ninformation, and incentive system will be set up to increase the ownership of management and\nemployees of enterprises. All enterprises will be required to use the amount allocated for the\ninstitutional strengthening component solely for management training and enterprise restructuring.", "CAUSE - EFFECT AND PROJECT OBJECTIVE TREE ANALYSIS\nNegative Economic Impacts and Reduced Growth Poverty Reduction through Cleaner Environment\nand Enhanced Economic Growth\nIncreased Health Risk to Population Especially Reduced Health Risk to Population Especially Children,\nChildren, Women and Elderly Women and Elderly\nDamage to Agriculture, Ecosystems, Prevention and Reduction of Damage to Agriculture,\nBuildings/Infrastructure, Protected Areas, and Ecosystems, Buildings, Infrastructure, Protected Areas,\n.\nUnique Cultural Sites and Unique Cultural Sites\n4\n3\nHigh Air Pollution Loads Reduced Air Pollution and Acid\nand Regional Acid Rain Rain Frequency\n\u2022  Weak Legal System and Enforcement Practices \u2022  Updated Legislation for Stronger Enforcement\n\u2022  Insufficient Monitoring Capability \u2022  Enhanced Monitoring Capability\n\u2022  Limited Pollution Prevention Incentives \u2022  New Incentives to Reduce Pollution\n\u2022  Planned Economy \u2022  Continued Market Reforms\n\u2022  Inefficient Technology \u2022  Technology Modernization\n\u2022  Rapid Industrial Growth \u2022  Sustainable Industrial Management Policy\n\u2022  Energy Policy Favoring Coal Over Cleaner \u2022  Energy Policy Promoting Alternate Resources\nA\nAlternatives and Non-fossil Fuel Energy Supplies p\np\n\u2022  Rapid Urbanization and Growth of Motor Vehicles \u2022  Improved Urban Planning e\nn\nd\nix\n \n4", "44 Appendix 5, page 1\nINSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING PLAN\nA.

Cleaner Production (CP) Subprojects\n1. Income Statement\n1. The past and projected financial performance of the CP subprojects are presented in Tables\nA10.1-A10.6. Projected revenues were determined by multiplying the total volume of production,\ntaking into account their anticipated capacity utilization on the basis of current performance by the\nanticipated  constant  unit  price.  The  Project  is  not  supporting  capacity  expansion  in  any  CP\nsubproject.  However,  certain  subprojects  are  implementing  minor  modifications  to  improve\nefficiencies in production. Such modifications are considered in the projected financial statements\nand in the financial analysis. Product prices are based on end-2000 prices, adjusted to reflect\nconservative market conditions. Some adjustment in intermediate and finished products from the\nintroduction of cleaner technologies will result in some additional production (e.g., SO  conversion to\n2\nsulfuric acid) while substantially reducing emissions.\n2. Cost of Sale\n2. Cost of sales for the CP subproject enterprises comprises raw material costs, utilities, direct\nlabor, depreciation, and other factory overhead. The cost of raw materials and utilities are based on\ninput quantities required for each unit of output. Except for electricity, other variable costs are\nprojected to increase in line with output prices. Direct labor, depreciation, and other factory overhead\ncosts are allocated to products based on percentage of sales. Real growth rates of wages and\nsalaries  are  expected  to  be  in  line  with  those  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The\ndepreciation rate is estimated at 5 percent annually, calculated on a declining balance basis, while\nother production costs are projected in accordance with the raw material costs. Operating expenses\ninclude administrative salaries and pensions, indirect depreciation, amortization of intangible and\ndeferred assets, marketing, and administrative costs. Marketing expenses are projected at 1 percent\nof sales. Interest on the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan is calculated at London interbank\noffered rate (LIBOR)-based rates with a 0.75 percent commitment charge and 1 percent front-end\nfee. The local loan rate is 6.2 percent. Taxes, other than value-added taxes (VAT) at 17 percent and\nincome taxes, are the education surcharge and construction tax, calculated as 3 and 7 percent of\nincremental VAT, respectively.  The income tax is calculated at 33 percent.\n3. Balance Sheet\n3. The future average working capital requirements were estimated with reference to each\nenterprise\u2019s past working capital requirements. Fixed assets and investments are recorded in the\nbalance sheet at their historical costs. For the CP subproject enterprises, an average depreciation\nrate of 5 percent per annum was applied to this average fixed asset balance to derive annual\ndepreciation.  Long-term  debt  is  based  on  the  actual  balances  as  of  31  December  2000,  with\nadditional long-term debt added as required for the Project. Capital expenditures represent planned\nexpenditures to be incurred by the enterprises for the Project. The financing plan for each of the\nenterprises as components of the Project is presented in Table A10.7.", "56 Appendix 10, page 2\nTable A10.7: Financing Plan (Y million)\nItem ATC CNM WFW WHC WSC WZW\nEquity 180.1 72.2 105.6 108.2 110.0 163.1\nDebt 425.8 125.3 205.2 180.6 295.0 245.6\nADB 215.8 90.9 160.2 150.6 201.7 187.6\nOther 210.0 34.4 45.0 30.0 93.3 58.0\nTotal 605.9 197.5 310.8 288.8 40.5 408.7\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ATC = Anhui Tongdu Copper Limited Co., CNM = Chizhou Non-\nFerrous Metals Group Co., WFW = Wuhu Feiying Wood Chemicals Limited  Co., WHC = Wuhu\nHengchang Copper Refinery Co., WSC = Wuhu Shanjiang Chemicals Limited Co., WZM = Wuhu\nZhengxing Materials Limited Co.\nB. Environmental Improvement and Acid Rain Damage Rehabilitation (EI-ARD) Subprojects\n1. Income Statement\n4. The past and projected financial performance of the EI-ARD subprojects are presented in\nTables A10.8-A10.10. Tourism is expected to increase by 3 percent per year in the Jiuhua and\nHuangshan sites from 2006 until 2010 due to increased capabilities to manage more visitors. The\nthree EI-ARD subprojects will raise revenues to support the investment by charging tariffs for water\nusage, sewage treatment, solid waste disposal, and/or electricity supply. All subprojects will be the\nsole suppliers of water, sewage, and solid waste services for the ecological areas. Revenues will\nincrease as EI-ARD subprojects serve more visitors. The annual increase is set at a conservative\nlevel compared with the subprojects\u2019 five-year plan.\n2. Cost of Sale\n5. Cost of sales for subproject operations include variable processing costs, direct labor, and\ndepreciation.  Operating  expenses  include  administrative  salaries  and  pensions,  marketing  and\nadministrative costs. Interest on the ADB loan and other loans was treated in the same manner as in\nthe  EI-ARD  enterprises.  The  education  surcharge  and  construction  tax  are  calculated  as  a\npercentage of incremental VAT. Income tax is calculated at 33 percent of taxable income. VAT has\nno effect on the income of the Huangshan Tourist Company since all collections pass through the\nGovernment.\n3. Balance Sheet\n6. Working capital requirements are estimated with reference to their past levels, increases\nrelated to the additional sales volume derived from the Project, and efficiency improvement expected\nand required by ADB. The depreciation rate is estimated at 5 percent, calculated on a declining\nbasis. Capital expenditures represent the planned expenditures to be incurred by the subprojects for\nthe  Project.

Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n1. Overall the Project requires the permanent acquisition of about 20.3 hectares (ha) of\nwhich 16.5 ha is in industrial zones and will not be resettled. The Jiuhua subproject will acquire\nthe remainder (3.8 ha) for water supply, wastewater, and solid waste treatment. This will affect\n23 households of 87 persons farming 1.3 ha of paddy owned by Kecun village. The village\ncollective has allocated land use to households under long-term contracts. It is responsible for\nrevising land-use contracts in the case of land acquisition.\nB. Consultation and Grievance Redress Participation\n2. Public consultation and information dissemination have been conducted since August\n1999 in line with the Chizhou government\u2019s plan to develop Kecun district.1 For the 23 affected\nfarming households, average monthly income is less than Y700 per month. On average, the\nland being requisitioned represents only 21 percent of total land farmed by the 23 households.\nThe village committee in coordination with the Jiuhua Shan Management Committee, the Jiuhua\nTown Government, and the Jiuhua Shan Land Administration Sector will address any appeals of\naffected persons.\nC. Compensation, Relocation, and Income Restoration\n3. With counterpart funds, the enterprise will provide compensation to the village committee\nin accordance with national and regional laws and regulation:2 Y100,000/mu3 and Y3,000/mu for\nstanding  crop.  JTC  will  give  the  compensation  directly  to  the  affected  persons.  The  JTC\nenterprise will give priority to displaced farmers when hiring new employees for its expansion.\nFurther, the village committee is organizing training programs with support from the enterprise\nfor alternative forms of livelihood based on the development plans for Kecun.\nD. Resettlement Financing, Implementation, and Monitoring\n4. Planning, implementation, inspection, and assessment will be the responsibility of the\nvillage committee, in coordination with the enterprise. Local committees and groups will also\ndisseminate  information  and  conduct  public  discussions  for  affected  persons  to  facilitate\nresettlement. Budget sourced from counterpart funding is estimated at Y2.55 million.\n5. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on the Government-approved land acquisition\nand resettlement plans submitted by the subprojects. At the beginning of 2002, a monitoring and\nevaluation committee including, legal experts, and representatives of community organizations\nwill be formed. Affected persons will be invited to attend public meetings to discuss issues\nregarding the resettlement.\n                                                          \n1 Consultations were conducted by the Kecun village committee (composed of representatives from several village\nteams selected by the village congress), the Kecun Development Office, and Jiuhua Tourism Group Company\n(JTC). A socioeconomic survey was conducted for farmers to be affected to provide information on the likely effects\nof land acquisition in terms of lost land, assets, and livelihood.\n2 Land Administration Law of PRC 1986, amended in 1998, and Implementation Rules of the Land Administration\nLaw of PRC, Anhui Province.\n3 15 mu = 1 hectare.", "68 Appendix 13, page 1\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS\nA. General\n1. The financial analysis of the cleaner production (CP) subprojects was carried out on an\nincremental basis (with and without the Project) using constant prices in 2001 yuan (Y). The\nproposed subprojects are assumed to begin operation in 2006. In addition to reducing pollution,\nthe subprojects will generate energy and material costs savings as well as improvement in\ncapacity utilization. Capacity utilization with the Project in years 1, 2, and 3 onward are 75, 85,\nand 90 percent for Anhui Tongdu Copper Limited Company (ATC), Chizhou Non-Ferrous Metals\nGroup Company (CNM), and Wuhu Hengchang Copper Refinery Copmany (WHC); 60, 80, and\n90 percent for Wuhu Zhengxing Materials Limited Company (WZM); 90, 90, 90 percent for\nWuhu Shanjiang Chemicals Limited Company (WSC); and 70, 80, and 90 percent for Wuhu\nFeiying Wood Chemicals Limited Company (WFW). Project cost estimates were converted to\nreal  terms  by  removing  the  effects  of  inflation  and  devaluation  of  the  yuan.  Physical\ncontingencies are 5 percent of capital costs for all the subprojects.\nB. Cleaner Production Subprojects\n2. Electrolytic copper prices are based on international prices as quoted on the London\nMetal Exchange (LME). There is a small premium in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) due\nto the country\u2019s supply and demand situation. Copper prices are volatile and have ranged from\nY13,545 to Y15,247 per ton in 2001. Since 1997, copper prices have ranged from Y11,243 to\nY16,647 per ton. The price of the company\u2019s copper raw materials also moves closely with the\nLME. The projections for ATC assume a selling price of Y15,339 per ton. ATC will realize\nincremental  production  efficiency  from  the  subproject  due  to  the  installation  of  top-blown\nsubmerged  lance  smelting  and  a  rotary  anode  furnace.  The  equipment  will  also  give  the\ncompany more capability to process lower-grade raw materials. In addition, ATC will realize\nenergy cost savings of 12 percent per ton.\n3. CNM  will  realize  improved  efficiency  from  the  subproject  because  the  installed\nequipment will allow it to process lower-grade local ore and reduce its dependence on imported\nore. Other process improvements will allow the company to realize 2 percent savings in the\namount of raw material required and an 8 percent reduction in energy costs.\n4. WHC will benefit from increased capability to utilize lower-grade raw materials. The\nsubproject will also generate energy savings, reducing the energy cost per ton by 54 percent.\n5. WZM will close down its steel making production line. WZM has used an average selling\nprice of Y3,400 per ton for ductile pipe. Current prices are Y4,800 and are expected to increase\ndue to strong demand. The price projection for pig iron is Y1,000 per ton compared with the\ncurrent price of Y1,150. In recent years, the price of pig iron has ranged from Y900 per ton to\nY1,000 per ton. The project will benefit WZM as the company will replace an aging highly\npolluting rolling mill with ductile pipe equipment. Ductile pipe has higher margins and a stronger\ndemand outlook.\n6. Selling prices for WSC\u2019s primary products have been depressed in recent years. In 2001\nthey have all experienced increases and forecasts are for moderate increases due to demand\nstrength in the PRC. The subproject will benefit in terms of the financial performance of WSC by\nallowing its full capacity utilization because it will produce higher quality I-membrane caustic\nsoda,  improve  its  recovery  of  liquid  chlorine,  and  produce  more  due  to  fewer  pollution", "69 Appendix 13, page 2\nconstraints. In addition, WCS will realize energy savings of 33 percent for those products and\ngenerate excess steam to sell for heat to nearby consumers.\nC. Environmental Improvement Subprojects\n7. Huangshan Water Company (HWC) will generate incremental revenues from the project\nthrough increased capacity for water supply, sewage treatment, and solid waste disposal while\nHuangshan  Electric  Company  (HEC)  will  generate  incremental  revenues  from  the  project\nthrough increased electricity sales. All tariffs will be increased at 3 percent per annum until\n2010. The Project will provide infrastructure that is necessary for the scenic area to continue to\ngrow  and  manage  more  visitors.  Jiuhua  Tourism  Group  Company  (JTC)  will  generate\nincremental revenues from the project through water supply, sewage treatment, and solid waste\ndisposal tariffs. The revenues will be increased at 6 percent per year until 2010.\nD. Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) and Sensitivity Analysis\n8. The FIRRs for the six CP subprojects and the three environmental improvement and\nacid  rain  damage  rehabilitation  (EI-ARD)  subprojects  are  given  in  Tables  A13.1-A13.9.\nSensitivity analysis shows that the subprojects can withstand substantial risks during their\noperations.\nTable A.13.1:  ATC FIRR Calculation\nConstant (Y million)\nCopper Production Capital Incremental Working\nYear

Economic analysis was carried out on an incremental basis in constant prices.  Economic\nreturns are calculated over a 20-year period corresponding to the economic life of the subproject\ninvestments.  For  the  major  traded  inputs  and  outputs,  the  economic  resource  flows  were\nestimated in border prices using the domestic currency as numeraire. Traded goods valued at the\nborder price level were revalued to the domestic price level through the shadow exchange rate\nfactor (SERF) of 1.11 equal to the inverse of the standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 that has\nbeen used in other Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC).  For  nontraded  items,  the  resource  flows  were  estimated  from  financial  prices  using\nconversion factors and shadow prices. The economic analysis was conducted in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.\nA. Economic Costs\n2. Data  for  capital  costs  was  taken  from  the  financial  analysis  adjusted  using  relevant\nconversion factors, expressed in constant prices. In calculating economic capital costs, all duties,\nsubsidies,  taxes,  and  resource  transfers  were  excluded.  Only  real  resource  claims  were\nconsidered in calculating incremental working capital. The price of electricity was set equal to an\nupdated estimate of the long-run marginal cost of production, generation, and distribution of\nelectricity in the PRC.1  The economic price of water was calculated by adapting a local survey\nmeasure of willingness to pay (WTP) for each cubic meter (m3) of water.  The economic price of\nwater was equated with an income-adjusted updated household WTP value (Y/m3) for the control\nand cleanup of wastewater discharges in Hefei (capital of Anhui). The nontraded labor inputs are\nadjusted by the SCFs of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 for skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled labor, respectively.\nA weighted (by number of staff) average conversion factor was applied to the wage and salary\nlevels in the financial model. This labor conversion factor averaged between 0.80 and 0.82. Major\nraw material inputs were adjusted by conversion factors reflecting border price equivalent values\nand shadow prices.\nB. Economic Benefits\n3. The  incremental  economic  benefits  from  the  six  cleaner  production  (CP)  subproject\ninvestments  are  derived  from  the  increased  value  of  output  (reflecting  increased  value  of\nconsumption  to  society),  foreign  exchange  savings,  production  efficiencies  involving  energy\nconservation, and the use of solid waste by-products as raw material inputs.  A key efficiency and\nenvironmental improvement feature of most of the subprojects is mining the waste stream (solid\nand liquid) for valuable raw material inputs.  This waste stream utilization results in value-added\neconomic  activity.  Because  the  main  plant  outputs  from  the  subproject  investments  are\nincremental, the shadow price applied was based on the financial market price inclusive of the\ndomestic consumption tax less subsidies to the buyer. Electrolytic copper is an output in several\nof the subproject investments. Since refined copper consumption exceeds production in the PRC,\nthe economic price for electrolytic copper was calculated as the border price equivalent value\nadjusted by the SERF.2 Several of the subproject investments are expected to result in energy\nsavings that are equivalent to a given amount of tons per year of standard coal equivalent.  These\nsavings were monetized by applying the economic value of coal to the annual standard coal\nequivalent volumes (in tons) expected to be saved.  The economic price of coal was a border\nprice  equivalent  value.    Economic  prices  for  the  solid  waste  by-product  materials  were\ndetermined from local market prices adjusted by conversion factor reflecting their shadow prices.\n                                                          \n1 World Bank, 1997. Clear Water Blue Skies: China\u2019s Environment in the New Century (p. 52) and updated by applying\ncost escalation factor derived from the urban consumer price index in the country economic review.\n2 World Bank, April 2000. Global Commodity Markets, page 69.", "73 Appendix 14, page 2\nC. Cost-Benefit Analysis\n4. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the overall Project is 20.4 percent (Table\nA14.1). The EIRRs for the CP subproject investments range from 14.2 to 27.5 percent (Table\n14.2-14.7).  The  EIRRs  for  the  three  environmental  improvement  and  acid  rain  damage\nrehabilitation subprojects range from 19.7 to 23.9 percent (Table 14.8-14.10). These values are\ngreater than the 12 percent discount rate, which represents the economic opportunity cost of\ncapital. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the subprojects continue to be viable under the most\nplausible  of  risk-related  scenarios.  Subproject  EIRRs  are  most  sensitive  or  responsive  to\nreductions in benefits as opposed to increases in costs or project implementation delays. The\nanalysis also suggests that the economic feasibility of the project can withstand a number of\nadverse risk conditions.\nTable A14.1: Economic Analysis (Y\u2019000)\nYear Capital O&M Other Incremental Economic Net Economic\nCosts Costs Social Costs Benefits Benefits\n2002 (281,023) (3,318) (19,860) (236,261) (540,462)\n2003 (610,085) (5,979) (20,058) (338,810) (974,746)\n2004 (759,509) (5,707) (30,757) (471,780) (1,267,753)\n2005 (435,956) (163,745) (31,061) (157,662) (788,423)\n2006 (16,807) (703,809) (31,366) 815,393 63,410\n2007 (16,807) (10,14,241) (31,671) 1,500,786 438,066\n2008 (14,307) (1,199,412) (31,978) 1,924,180 678,483\n2009 (11,807) (1,175,636) (32,286) 2,121,105 901,345\n2010 (11,807) (1,176,638) (32,595) 2,387,476 1,166,436\n2011 (11,807) (1,177,729) (32,933) 2,568,953 1,346,483\n2012 (11,807) (1,178,717) (34,130) 2,837,514 1,612,860\n2013 (11,807) (1,179,784) (35,381) 3,009,565 1,782,593\n2014 (11,807) (1,180,936) (36,691) 3,071,811 1,842,377\n2015 (11,807) (1,182,181) (38,062) 3,131,568 1,899,518\n2016 (11,807) (1,183,525) (39,496) 3,188,934 1,954,106\n2017 (11,807) (1,184,976) (40,998) 3,188,934 1,951,153\n2018 (11,807) (1,186,544) (42,570) 3,188,934 1,948,013\n2019 (11,807) (1,188,237) (44,215) 3,188,934 1,944,674\n2020 (11,807) (1,190,066) (45,939) 3,188,934 1,941,123\n2021 (11,807) (1,192,040) (47,743) 3,188,934 1,937,343\n2022 203,430 (914,569) (49,633) 3,188,934 2,428,163\nNPV@12 (1,594,934) (4,961,626) 9,632,034 2,714,953\nEIRR 20.4%\nD.  Risk Analysis\n5. To  complement  this  deterministic  analysis,  risk  analyses  was  undertaken  using  a\nprobabilistic  approach  to  the  perceived  risk  factors  that  affect  project  viability.  Four  broad\ncategories of risk were considered: (i) benefit reduction, (ii) capital cost increase, (iii) operational\nand maintenance cost increase, and (iv) commencement delay. Risk analysis was carried out\nusing  the  Monte  Carlo  simulation  technique.  Results  from  3,000  simulations  show  that  the\nexpected EIRR for the Project, based on the weighted average of all simulated combinations is\n19.9 percent (with a standard deviation of 2.1 percent), about 2 percent lower than the base case\nEIRR (without considering project risks). The probability for the EIRR to fall below the considered\ndiscount rate of 12 percent is almost zero.", "Appendix 14, page 3\n74\nTable A14.2: ATC Economic Analysis (Y'000) Table A14.3: CNM Economic
