I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed policy-\nbased loans to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Improving Competitiveness Program \n(this program).1 \n \n2.  This program supports the government\u2019s structural reform program. The government\u2019s \nstructural reform priorities are set out in its Socio-Economic Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020 \nand  also  it\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015.  The  strategy  identifies  three \nstrategic  priorities:  (i)  improved  market  institutions  and  administrative  reforms  for  a  more \ncompetitive and equitable business environment, (ii) development of human resources and \ninvestment in science and technology, and (iii) improved infrastructure. Under the first strategic \npriority, the government is focusing structural reforms in three areas: state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs), the banking sector, and public investment management. \n  \n3.  Support under this program aligns to a subset of the government\u2019s broad structural \nreform  program  through  collaboration  with  other  development  partners.  The  World  Bank \nprovided  support  through  the  Economic  Management  Competitiveness  Credit  (EMCC) \ndevelopment policy operation and the Japan International Cooperation Agency also provided \nsupport.2 The EMCC consists of a programmatic series of three policy-based operations (EMCC \n1\u20133) implemented during 2013\u20132015. The program is based on a common policy matrix with \nEMCC-2 (Appendix 4).3 The program aims to enhance competitiveness through reform efforts in \nsix  policy  areas:  (i)  banking  sector,  (ii) fiscal  policy,  (iii) public  sector  administration  and \naccountability, (iv) state enterprise management, (v) public investment management, and (vi) \nbusiness  environment.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  did  not  provide  collaborative \ncofinancing  to  the  approved  EMCC-1,4 but  supported  government  reforms  through  closely \naligned program loans.5 ADB will support the government\u2019s reform agenda during EMCC-3 \nsubject to continued reform progress. EMCC-3 will focus on actual implementation of policy \nactions under EMCC-2.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n4.  Losing  competitiveness.  Cross-country  assessments  show  Viet  Nam  is  losing \ncompetitiveness relative to other countries. Viet Nam\u2019s ranking of 70th out of 148 countries in \nthe 2013\u20132014 World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index is one notch down from \n2006\u20132007. During this period, Indonesia has moved up by 19 places and Cambodia by 23. Viet \nNam\u2019s ranking in the Doing Business survey has fallen from 90th in 2011 to 99th in 2014. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Government  of  Canada  (Can$6  million)  and  the  Government  of  Switzerland  (SwF8  million)  provided \ncofinancing through the EMCC framework. The World Bank administered technical assistance funds provided by \nthe Department for International Development of the United Kingdom ($225,000) and the Government of Australia \n($150,000) for analytical work and capacity building activities.  \n3  World Bank. 2014.

", "2 \nReduced competitiveness is hurting private investment and slowing gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth. \n \n5.  More vigorous competition needed to boost private investment and growth. The \nyear 1986 marked a shift in policy away from central planning and toward a mixed economy\u2014\ntermed  a  \u201csocialist  market  economy.\u201d  Subsequently,  during  1990\u20132007  private  investment \naccelerated, the economy grew at an annual average rate of more than 7.0%, and per capita \nincome almost quintupled. However, this growth trajectory ultimately has limited potential, and \ngrowth has been increasingly based on factor accumulation and not productivity.6 Domestic \nprivate investment as a ratio of GDP has declined from an average of 15.0% in 2007\u20132010 to \naround 11.5% in 2013. During 2009\u20132012, 43 out of the 63 provinces saw a decline in their \nprovincial  competitiveness  index.7 Far  fewer  private  firms  reported  higher  investments  or \nintentions  to  expand  production.  To  avoid  the  middle-income  trap,  Viet  Nam  will  need  to \nupgrade existing competitiveness fundamentals. \n \n6.  Constraints  on  competitiveness.  Various  country  diagnostics  have  identified  the \nfollowing similar constraints on competitiveness and sustained economic growth:8  \n \n(i)  Workforce skill levels remain modest.  \n(ii)  The  finance  sector  has  expanded  quickly  but  remains  shallow  and \nunsophisticated.  Nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  have  risen  because  of \nshortcomings in risk management at banks and weaknesses in the regulatory \nand supervisory framework.  \n(iii)  Fiscal policy is hampered by the high structural deficits in the government sector. \nPublic investment is inefficient and crowding out private investment.  \n(iv)  Unequal  treatment  exists  in  the  enterprise  sector,  where  SOEs  and  well-\nconnected private firms have preferential access to land, credit, and public sector \ncontracts.  \n(v)  Weak  public  administrative  capacity  and  unclear  business  regulatory \nenvironment  are  obstacles  to  more  vigorous  market  competition.  Corruption \nremains pervasive. \n \n7.  High-level political commitment for priority reforms to boost competitiveness. To \nhelp steer reform efforts to boost competitiveness, in May 2012 the prime minister established a \nnational council on sustainable development and competitiveness capacity enhancement, which \nis chaired by a deputy prime minister and has government-wide membership.  \n \n8.  ADB support for the government\u2019s reform agenda. ADB supports the government\u2019s \nreform agenda both through this program as well as other closely aligned policy-based loans. \nDuring the first phase of the government\u2019s program, the World Bank\u2019s EMCC-1 aligned to the \noverarching policy frameworks of a broad reform agenda. During this initial phase, ADB did not \nenter into collaborative cofinancing arrangements with the World Bank but instead supported \nthe government\u2019s reform agenda through closely aligned interventions such as program loans \nfor finance sector development and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development. \nThe EMCC-2 operation is more narrowly focused, mainly on banking and SOE reforms. Under \n                                                \n6  D. Mishra. 2011. Vietnam Development Report 2012: Market Economy for a Middle-Income Vietnam. Washington, \nDC: World Bank.  \n7  E.

Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry and United States Agency for International \nDevelopment \n8  J. Pincus. 2012. Vietnam\u2019s Reforms: The Road to Market Leninism. London. Legatum Institute. \n ", "3 \nthe current phase of the government\u2019s program, ADB and the World Bank are entering into a \ncollaborative cofinancing agreement to allow for more efficient donor coordination. In particular, \nthe reform agenda integrated in EMCC-2 is strategically important and complements ADB\u2019s \nongoing  policy  reform  programs,  as  well  as  the  pilot  SOE  restructuring  program.9 It  also \nprovides an opportunity for ADB to remain engaged in business environment reforms after \ncompletion of the SME development program in 2013. ADB will support the government\u2019s \nreform agenda during EMCC-3 subject to continued reform progress. \n \n9.  Collaboration with other development partners. The EMCC program policy matrix \nwas designed jointly by the World Bank; ADB; the Japan International Cooperation Agency; the \ngovernments  of  Switzerland,  Canada,  and  Australia;  and  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom. ADB actively participated during the program design \nphase, including stakeholder consultations on proposed objectives and areas of focus for the \nEMCC. ADB contributed across all reform areas but more so through areas of comparative \nadvantage,  especially  SOE  and  procurement  reforms.  ADB  contributions  include  (i)  direct \nengagement  in  policy  dialogue;  (ii)  provision  of  technical  comments  on  draft  laws  and \nregulations; (iii) diagnostics, particularly extraction from operational knowledge; and (iv) capacity \nbuilding activities.10 \n \n10.  Benefits of the joint donor programmatic approach. This program is aligned with the \n\u201cenhancing economic efficiency\u201d pillar of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015.11 It \nprovides a common platform for development partners to engage in policy dialogue with the \ngovernment. It enables better alignment of donor programs to government priorities and, as a \nresult, leverages more resources for the country. Coordination is improved and transaction \ncosts are reduced. ADB can also leverage support for its own policy-based loans in the finance \nand corporate sectors, while remaining engaged in other related policy reforms. \n \n11.  Lessons from earlier joint development partner policy-based operations. ADB has \nparticipated  in  joint  development  partner  programmatic  budget  support  in  Viet  Nam  since \n2003.12 A joint development partner evaluation suggested future policy-based lending  should \nbe more focused on a few important crosscutting issues, strengthen analytical underpinning of \nselected policy actions, and improve monitoring and communication of program impact.13 ADB\u2019s \nown evaluation is in line with this assessment.14 Consequently, the design of this program is \nmore  narrowly  focused,  and  has  dedicated  technical  assistance  funds  for  analytical  and \nadvisory support, as well as increased outreach to communicate results of the program. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the program will be increased private investment. The outcome will be the \nimproved competitiveness of Viet Nam\u2019s economy. \n \n                                                \n9  Mapping of Support for Financial Sector Reforms; Mapping of Support for State-Owned Enterprise Reforms \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10  Mapping  of  Support  for  Economic  Management  Competitiveness  Credit  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n11 ADB. 2012.

Completion Report: Support for Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program in Viet Nam. Manila.  \n ", "4 \nC.  Outputs \n13.  Program outputs align to the six EMCC reform areas. The program includes 11 policy \nactions identical to those under the EMCC-2. These policy actions were completed between \nMay 2013 and June 2014. The program also considered two crosscutting themes: the poverty \nand  social  impact  of  selected  reforms,  and  promoting  greater  data  and  policy-making \ntransparency.  \n \n14.  Enhanced banking sector stability (reform area 1). Enhanced banking sector stability \nrequires that weak banks are restructured, policies for dealing with systemic risks including \nNPLs are prioritized, and banking supervision is improved. \n \n15.  The program supports implementation of the government\u2019s credit institution restructuring \nplan. This includes relaxation of requirements on foreign investors by the State Bank of Viet \nNam  (SBV),  encouraging  more  foreign  participation  in  domestic  banks  as  a  way  to  meet \nbanking sector recapitalization needs. During May 2013 the SBV also adopted a comprehensive \npolicy framework to address the banking sector NPL problem. A significant element was the \nsetting up of the Viet Nam Asset Management Company (VAMC), responsible for the purchase, \nrecovery, and restructuring of bad debt. By 2013, the VAMC had purchased the equivalent of \n$1.9  billion  in  bad  debts  from  35  banks  (estimated  at  1.1%  of  all  outstanding  loans).  If \nadequately resourced and effectively supervised by the SBV, the VAMC could play an important \nrole in overall NPL resolution.  \n \n16.  ADB  supported  a  gap  assessment  between  Viet  Nam  and  international  accounting \nstandards to strengthen regulations on asset classification and loan provisioning (circular 2). \nThe extent to which the VAMC is able to deal with bad debts will hinge on the implementation of \nmore challenging aspects of the circular, such as adjustment of loan classifications based on \ncredit information center data. \n \n17.  Maintained fiscal policy (reform area 2). More fiscal transparency and discipline are \nneeded to balance government revenues and expenditures in a way that is consistent with a \nlong-term budget constraint of the public sector.  \n \n18.  In  May  2013  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  approved  the  medium-term  debt \nmanagement program, 2013\u20132015 that set medium-term targets across its entire debt portfolio. \nThe government has taken a number of steps to better monitor and report on prudential debt \nthresholds, including publication for the first time of consolidated information on both external \nand domestic government debt. The government also implemented treasury single account \nprocedures in two commercial banks. The implementation of such procedures is important \nbecause current cash management arrangements result in borrowing costs that are higher than \nnecessary. \n \n19.  Improved public administration and accountability (reform area 3). Improved public \nadministration  and  accountability  require  improved  transparency  and  simplified  public \nadministrative procedures.  \n \n20.  The  program  supports  legislation  to  regulate  and  guide  the  implementation  of  the \nAmended Law on Anti-Corruption, 2012, including increased transparency, income and asset \ndeclaration of public officials, and accountability of public agencies and officials. Decree 59 \nclarifies what constitutes acts of corruption and the process for checks and inspections. It also \ndetails procedures for suspension or transfer of officials suspected in corruption cases. Decree \n ", "5 \n78 provides more details on who is required to file declarations, what types of assets and \nincomes  need  to  be  declared,  and  when  to  file  the  asset  and  income  declarations.  One \nimportant aspect in the decree is the detailed process guiding the verification of asset and \nincome  declarations.  Another  notable  development  is  the  requirement  to  disclose  the \ndeclarations at the officials\u2019 offices or annual meetings of public agencies. Decree 90 is on \naccountability of public agencies and officials to provide better access to information for citizens. \nIt has a detailed process on how individuals or organizations can request accountability or \ninformation, and how public agencies should respond to such requests. \n \n21.  Strengthened  state  enterprise  management  (reform  area  4).  Strengthened  SOE \nmanagement requires successful restructuring of large SOEs, better corporate governance, and \nimproved regulatory environment for SOEs.  \n \n22.  The program supports implementation of the government\u2019s SOE reform agenda that \ncontains three broad elements: (i) regulatory environment for SOE restructuring (e.g. divestiture \nof state shareholding, restructuring of bad debts); (ii) the adoption and implementation of plans \nand targets for actual restructuring of SOEs; and (iii) corporate governance reforms of state \neconomic groups (SEGs) and general corporations.15 \n \n23.  The government has issued decisions on restructuring SEGs, which commit all SEGs to \ndivest five high-risk noncore activities (banking, insurance, real estate, securities trading, and \ninvestment funds) by 2015.16 ADB has supported the pilot restructuring of selected SOEs in the \nconstruction,  logistics,  and  textile  sectors.17 ADB  is  therefore  in  a  unique  position  to  feed \nlessons from the experience of restructuring several SEGs into the program design. These \noperations have highlighted several legal impediments that obstruct successful restructuring of \nSOEs into commercially competitive enterprises. The MOF with ADB support has developed an \nSOE  reform  plan  with  timelines  to  guide  the  sequencing  of  necessary  legal  reforms  and \ncoordination  among  government  agencies  and  is  working  toward  resolving  some  legal \nimpediments to SOE restructuring. These include Decree 71/2013/ND-CP issued in July 2013 \nallowing SOEs to sell assets below book value.  \n \n24.  By the end of June 2014, the government had approved restructuring plans for over 60% \nof  SEGs  and  general  corporations.  Many  were  however  based  on  limited  financial  and \noperational analysis. ADB is therefore providing technical assistance (processed separately and \nalready approved) to carry out due diligence on restructuring plans of those SEGs and to \nsupport its implementation under its pilot restructuring program. ADB is also providing capacity \nbuilding support to the management of pilot SEGs being restructured, including on internal \naudit, corporate governance, and enterprise risk management. These skills are lacking because \nthe operating focus of enterprise management has been on preserving the value of state capital \nrather than increasing its value.  \n \n                                                \n15 During the early 2000s, the government concurrently consolidated some SOEs into larger entities (general \ncorporations) and established SEGs (a loose alliance of several SOEs with similar business interests) with the \nintention of creating globally competitive SOEs. By the end of 2013, there were around 100 general corporations \nand SEGs. \n16 PM Decision 320/QD-TTg dated 8 February 2013, PM Decision 1782/QD-TTg dated 23 November 2012, PM \nDecision 314/QD-TTg dated 7 February 2013, PM Decision 38/QD-TTg dated 5 January 2013, PM Decision \n753/QD-TTg dated 17 May 2013, PM Decision 2097/QD-TTg dated 28 December 2012, PM Decision 46/QD-TTg \ndated 5 January 2013, and Decree 71/2013/ND-CP dated 11 July 2013 on restructuring of state economic groups. \n17 ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Viet Nam: SOE Reform and \nCorporate Governance Facilitation Program - PFR 1. Manila. \n ", "6 \n25.  The  government  issued  Decree  61  to  regulate  financial  supervision,  performance \nassessment, and disclosure of financial information of SOEs. Policy dialogue on this decree has \nbenefited from several ADB analytical papers that draw on pilot SOE restructuring case studies. \nAll  reports  were  prepared  in  response  to  government  requests.  Topics  include  corporate \ngovernance and financial information disclosure. These reports informed the new Decree 61 \nthat rationalizes and consolidates the existing legislative framework and provides greater clarity \non public disclosure of financial information. Development partners will be looking for evidence \nof  implementation  of  Decree  61,  including  publication  of  key  financial  and  operational \nperformance of all SEGs. SOE supervising and monitoring institutions will therefore require \ncapacity building to better understand the principles of market-driven commercial operations \nand to upgrade their skills in the oversight role of monitoring and evaluation. The MOF is \ncurrently developing a monitoring and evaluation framework to monitor reform progress with the \nsupport of ADB. \n \n26.  Enhanced  public  investment  management  (reform  area  5).  Enhanced  public \ninvestment management requires improved public investment planning, prioritization of capital \nspending, and increased project efficiency.  \n \n27.  The government approved a medium-term investment plan, 2013\u20132015 that set capital \nexpenditure  priorities.  This  program  included  a  directive  to  accelerate  clearance  of  capital \nexpenditure  arrears.  All  implementing  ministries  and  agencies  have  since  reported  to  the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment and the MOF the current status of arrears and how they \npropose to handle these.  \n \n28.  Improved business environment (reform area 6). An enabling business environment \nrequires simplified administrative procedures and a clearer and more transparent commercial \nregulatory environment that encourages competition.  \n \n29.  In 2013 the government has taken a number of measures to improve the business \nenvironment. This included the launching of the government\u2019s online business registration portal \nand simplification of administrative procedures across government. \n \n30.  The  government  and  development  partners  have  been  working  closely  on  public \nprocurement reform, which has a major impact on the business environment. Program policy \nactions  include  an  Amended  Law  on  Procurement,  2013  to  strengthen  transparency  and \ncompetition in public procurement.  ADB has a large country investment portfolio and vast \noperational knowledge on government procurement systems. In coordination with the World \nBank, ADB has provided substantial technical inputs on drafting of the amended  law and \nsecondary  legislation  related  to  its  implementation.  The  amended  law  contains  significant \nimprovements,  including  (i)  expanded  scope  to  include  public\u2013private  partnerships  and \nexpenditures  by  SOEs,  (ii)  introduction  of  innovative  electronic  systems  that  enhance  the \nefficiency and transparency of the procurement system, (iii) provisions to limit use and abuse of \ndirect contracting, and (iv) the new law implicitly superseding procurement-related provisions in \nother  laws  to  ensure  consistent  application  and  better  enforcement.  Despite  these \nimprovements, some deficiencies remain, such as lack of an independent bidder complaint \nmechanism and mandatory requirement for foreign firms to associate with local companies. \nADB will examine implementation of the new legislation. \n \n31.  Other program policy actions related to tax reforms. An Amended Law on Value-Added \nTax (VAT), 2013 includes a lower threshold, allowing a large number of taxpayers to move out \nof the VAT network under the invoice credit method, thereby reducing both tax compliance cost \n ", "7 \nand tax administration costs. The government also adopted an Amended Law on Corporate \nIncome  Tax,  2013  to  establish  competitive  corporate  income  tax  rates,  clarify  rules  and \nregulations on transfer pricing, and introduce provisions on deductible expenses. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n32.  In 2014, with a budget deficit target of 5.3%, the government will need to borrow D215 \ntrillion ($10.2 billion). EMCC-2 collaborative cofinancing contributes about 6% of Viet Nam\u2019s \nbudget deficit financing requirements, and an even higher share of concessional financing to the \nbudget. ADB will provide $230 million, contributing about 36% of total EMCC-2 pledges by \ndevelopment partners (Table 1).18  \n \n33.  The government has requested (i) a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR60.68 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, and (ii) a loan of $140 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the program. The Special Funds resources loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The ordinary capital resources \nloan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. The loans will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s simplified \ndisbursement procedure for policy-based loans19 based on a negative list.20 \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  230.00  36.5 \n     Ordinary capital resources (loan)  140.00  22.2 \n     Special Funds resources (loan)         90.00  14.3 \nWorld Bank  250.00                                 3  9  . 7   \nJapan International Cooperation Agency  150.00                          23.8 \nTotal  630.00  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n34.  The SBV will be the executing agency. The EMCC has a tiered governance structure. A \nsteering committee is chaired by a deputy prime minister and includes heads of agencies of key \nimplementing agencies. The steering committee reviews and endorses the proposed areas of \noperational focus. Technical teams, represented by senior technocrats from key implementing \nagencies and EMCC development partners, help oversee the preparation of the operation, \ndiscuss  the  technical  elements  of  policy  actions,  decide  on  analytical  work,  and  brief  the \nsteering committee. Annually, three technical missions are carried out to appraise and monitor \nprogress toward policy actions. The EMCC includes a trust fund for targeted analytical and \nadvisory activities to underpin the strategic focus of the EMCC. ADB does not contribute directly \nto the trust fund but has contributed knowledge by leveraging off ongoing operations, such as \nlessons learned from SOE restructuring. The implementation arrangements are summarized in \nTable 2.  \n                                                \n18 Financing contributions under EMCC-2 include $250 million from the World Bank and $150 million from the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. \n19 ADB. 1998.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n35.  It is not possible to accurately estimate the cost of structural reforms under the program \nbecause of unreliable data on NPLs in the banking sector and contingent liabilities associated \nwith  unprofitable  SOEs  that  need  restructuring.  International  credit  rating  agencies  have \nestimated NPLs at 15%\u201330% of total banking system loans. Even on the lower end, this would \nrequire $4 billion of additional capital to absorb the losses embedded in these assets. Structural \nreforms will boost competitiveness by improving efficiency of SOEs and public investment, and \nreduce crowding out of private investment. Enhanced banking sector stability and an improve \nbusiness environment will encourage entrepreneurship and private investment. A recent debt \nsustainability analysis included a reform scenario whereby medium- to long-term GDP growth \nwas 1.0%\u20131.5% of GDP higher than in a scenario with no reforms.21 \n \nB.  Governance \n36.  Viet Nam\u2019s public financial management (PFM) environment is considered adequate to \nsupport this program. The 2013 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment22 \nassessed that the government has maintained strong ownership of the PFM reform agenda and \ncontinues to lead a coordinated reform program in consultation with the donor community. \nHowever, while the financial management and accountability systems of the government have \nimproved, there remain weaknesses that need to be addressed. Table 3 includes some details \non PFM risks and proposed mitigation measures. \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n38.  The program is expected to have an overall positive effect on poverty reduction and \nemployment  in  the  long  run  by  improving  productivity.  However,  rationalization  of  public \ninvestment  and  potential  SOE  labor retrenchment may  result  in  short-term  negative  social \nimpacts. The government has an established set of policies and institutions to deal with SOE \n                                                \n21 International Monetary Fund. 2013.

ADB has conducted \nanalytical work on social impacts of SOE restructuring to inform policy developments in this area. \n \n39.  The  program  has  positive  social  impacts,  including  (i)  simplified  VAT  procedures \nreducing  transaction  costs  for  enterprises  with  favorable  effects  on  economic  growth  and \nemployment; (ii) reduced corporate income tax applied to SMEs to reduce tax obligations of \nenterprises,  lessen  potential  layoffs,  and  increase  wages;  (iii)  government  efforts  to  clear \narrears to contractors in the construction sector where a growing number of workers have not \nbeen paid; and (iv) improved implementation of the Amended Anti-Corruption Law, 2012 to \nreduce  transaction  costs for  enterprises,  especially  SMEs,  and  programs  targeting  poverty \nreduction. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n40.  The program will not entail any involuntary resettlement or negatively affect indigenous \npeople or the environment. It is therefore assigned category C for all safeguard categories. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n41.  The program is complex due to the nature of reforms, but risk is deemed manageable \nbased on ADB\u2019s experience implementing program-based loans in Viet Nam. The integrated \nbenefits and impacts of the program are expected to outweigh the costs of risk mitigating \nmeasures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 The overall risk rating is assessed as \nmedium. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \n1.
