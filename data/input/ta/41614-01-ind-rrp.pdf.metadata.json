In addition, technical assistance (TA) will \nalso be provided. The physical investments will address current \nunserved  energy  demand  and  provide  additional  capacity  to \nmeet forecast demand growth. \n \n   \nBackground   The  Government  of  India  (the  Government),  recognizing \nelectricity as one of the key drivers for economic growth and \npoverty reduction, has confirmed its mission to provide electricity \nto all households at an affordable price by 2012.  \n \nIn 2006 the Government introduced the Integrated Energy Policy \nto ensure adequate and reliable energy supplies in a technically \nefficient,  economically  viable,  and  environmentally  sustainable \nmanner.  Specific  measures  of  the  policy  include  continuing \nrelated power reforms, e.g., reducing aggregated technical and \ncommercial  losses  of  the  state  transmission  and  distribution \n(T&D) utilities and other restructuring efforts.  \n \nThe government of Assam (GOA) set out a policy for power \nreforms in the Power Policy Statement 2003. Aims of the policy \ninclude (i) achievement of commercial efficiency and financial \nviability of the power sector so that it will not require Assam\u2019s \nfinancial  resources,  which  are  needed  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment;  (ii)  improved  delivery  of  services  and \ncost-effectiveness  through  technical,  managerial,  and \nadministrative  restructuring  of  power  utilities;  and \n(iii) increased operating efficiency of all power utilities through \n ", "ii \n \ncompetition, managerial autonomy, and higher accountability.  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported Assam\u2019s power \nreforms  through  the  Assam  Power  Sector  Development \nProgram. The program comprised a $150 million program loan \n(2036-IND) and a $100 million project loan (2037-IND). In 2002, \nin  tandem  with  the  program,  Assam  State  Electricity  Board \n(ASEB),  under  the  Companies  Act  (1956),  incorporated  its \nsuccessor  entities:  Assam  Power  Generation  Corporation \nLimited  (APGCL);  Assam  Electricity  Grid  Corporation  Limited \n(AEGCL);  and  three  distribution  companies:  Central  Assam \nElectricity  Distribution  Company  Limited  (CAEDCL),  Lower \nAssam Electricity Distribution Company Limited (LAEDCL) and \nUpper  Assam  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited \n(UAEDCL). ASEB remains active as a coordinating agency. In \nApril 2009, CAEDCL and UAEDCL were merged into LAEDCL to \nenhance operating efficiency. \n \nAEGCL develops, operates, and maintains the transmission grid \nin the state; and LAEDCL develops, operates, and maintains the \ndistribution  grid.  Improvements  include  increased  T&D  circuit \nlength, increased T&D capacity, and reduced T&D losses (from \n42.5% in 2003 to 35.0% in 2009). Assam's future peak power \ndemand is forecasted to increase to 1,883 megawatts (MW) by \n2014 with an annual increase of 14.2%. To meet the demand, \nnew power plants will be constructed with sufficient additional \ncapacity. However, limited capacity of the Assam T&D system \ncan constrain the delivery of power to consumers. Therefore, \nT&D capacity needs to be expanded and system access and \nefficiency enhanced. \n \n  Policy  Environment.  The  Electricity  Act  (2003)  provides  a \ncomprehensive  legal  framework  for  implementing  reforms, \nincluding (i) unbundling state electricity boards, (ii) establishing \nstate regulators, (iii) licensing, and (iv) developing an antitheft \nprovision. Certain provisions in the act have been initiated, e.g., \n(i) open access to the T&D network, (ii) recognition of power \ntrading  as  a  distinct  activity,  (iii)  creation  of  distribution \nfranchisees, and (iv) a minimum  procurement requirement by \nlicensees from renewable sources. \n \nRoad  Map.  GOA  developed  a  T&D  road  map  linked  to  the \nInvestment Program. The objective is to establish the route to \nachieve sustainable T&D growth in the state. It aims to deliver \nthe  following  outcomes:  (i)  strengthened  power  transmission \ncapacity to deliver reliable and affordable electricity, (ii) improved \naccess  to  electricity,  (iii)  enhanced  efficiency  and  quality  of \npower supply, (iv) ensured financial health of the power sector \nthrough continued reform, and (v) mainstreamed private sector \nparticipation.  \n   \n ", "iii \nMultitranche Financing  The financing will be provided under a multitranche financing \nFacility  facility  (MFF),  in  accordance  with  ADB  policy.  The  MFF  will \nextend multiple loans not exceeding $200 million, in aggregate, \nto finance part of the costs of projects under the Investment \nProgram. The MFF is expected to be provided in three tranches.  \n \nThe  provisions  of  the  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations \napplicable  to  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based loans will apply to each loan. The specific terms \nof  each  loan  will  be  based  on  the  related  periodic  financing \nrequest (PFR) with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese choices were made independently, and did not rely on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.  \n   \nRationale  The Investment Program will (i) strengthen power transmission \ncapacity to deliver reliable and affordable electricity, (ii) improve \naccess to electricity in distribution through grid electricity and \noff-grid  renewable  and  conventional  energy-based  electricity, \n(iii) enhance efficiency and quality of power supply, (iv) ensure \nfinancial health of the power sector through continued reform, \nand  (v)  promote  private  sector  participation.  The  Investment \nProgram includes a capacity development program component \nto meet the increasing management capacity requirements.  \n \nThe MFF is particularly well suited for the Investment Program \nbecause (i) its aim is to support GOA\u2019s long-term objectives, as \nstated in the T&D road map; (ii) the performance of ongoing \nprojects under the MFF can guide the provision of subsequent \nloans, thereby offering proper incentives for implementation; and \n(iii) the MFF can offer the flexibility required for the Investment \nProgram to support participation of the utilities at different stages \nof readiness.  \n  \nImpact and Outcome  The  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  promote  sustainable \nprovision of electricity in the state with increased T&D capacity to \nsupport inclusive economic growth.  \n \nThe outcome is enhanced quality and expanded service delivery \nof electricity in Assam through improved technical, commercial, \nand financial performance and capability of ASEB and the power \nutilities.  \n   \nInvestment Plan   During the Investment Program from 2009 to 2014, GOA intends \nto  carry  out  T&D  enhancements  valued  at  $764  million  with \nsupport from the Government, ADB, and other stakeholders.  \n \n \n \n ", "iv \n \n  Investment Plan   \n  ($ million)   \n    MFF-   \n  Investment  Related   \nComponent  Program  Projects  Tranche 1 \nTransmission  561.6  237.0  92.6 \nDistribution  150.0  75.2   \nDistributed Decentralized  50.0     \nGeneration \nCapacity Development a  2.4  2.4  2.4 \n    Total    764.0  314.6  95.0 \nMFF = multi-tranche financing facility \n\u00aa The Investment Program does not include the Technical Assistance.  \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nFinancing Plan                   Indicative Financing Plan  \n                               ($ million) \nInvestment  MFF- Related \nSource   Tranche1 \nProgram  Projects \nAsian Development Bank  200.0  200.0  60.3 \nWorld Bank  a  360.0     \nGovernment of Assam   154.0  114.6  34.7 \nPrivate Sector  50.0     \n  Total  764.0  314.6  95.0 \nMFF = multi-tranche financing facility \n\u00aa $764.0 million includes the investment for the Assam portion under the \nGovernment's  composite  scheme  of  development  of  transmission  and \ndistribution network in NER.

ADB  teams  will \nevaluate the PFRs for purposes of acceptance and processing. \nADB teams will provide ongoing guidance to the Government \nand GOA. ADB staff will inform the Government, and report to its \nManagement and the Board on the status of individual loans. \nFailure to comply with any of these could hold back financing \nunder the MFF. \n \n   \nTranches   The MFF is expected to be utilized in three tranches. Tranche 1 \n  will finance a set of projects for (i) transmission of power for \n  capacity addition in transmission lines of 220 kilovolts (kV) (180 \nkilometers [km]) and 132 kV (82 km), and capacity addition of \ntransformation  through  construction  of  1  new  220/132  kV \nsubstation and 5 new 132/33 kV substations; and (ii) extension \nand  augmentation  of  2  existing  substations.  The  tranche  will \ninclude capacity development.   \n \nTranche  2  is  expected  to  finance  a  set  of  projects  for \n ", "v \n(i) transmission of power for capacity addition in transmission \nlines of 220 kV (185 km) and 132 kV (160 km), and capacity \naddition of transformation through construction of 2 new 220/132 \nkV  substations  and  6  new  132/33  kV  substations;  and  (ii) \nextension and augmentation of 11 substations.  \n \nTranche 3 is expected to finance a set of projects for (i) access \nto  power  in  distribution,  (ii)  energy  efficiency  enhancement: \ndistribution loss reduction, and (iii) distribution franchising. This \ncomponent includes construction of new distribution substations \nand lines to enable the rollout of relevant franchising models. \n   \nFirst Periodic Financing  ASEB has submitted the first PFR to ADB for $60.3 million for \nRequest  tranche 1. This will cover payments from 2009 to 2014 related to \nconstruction of new transmission substations and lines, and loss \nreduction;  as  well  as  capacity  development  with  consulting \nservices. The PFR is  presented to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors \ntogether with this document and the FFA. The loan will have a \nterm of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. It will have \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear, and such other terms and conditions as agreed in the loan \nand project agreements.  \n   \nDisbursement  Disbursements under each loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment and GOA.  \n   \nAdvance Contracting and  For  each  project,  advance  contracting  is  proposed  for \nRetroactive Financing  procurement of equipment and civil works, and recruitment of \nconsultants, subject to these being eligible according to agreed \nprocedures,  and  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nRetroactive financing is proposed under the individual loans for \nexpenditures incurred up to 12 months prior to the signing of the \ncorresponding loan agreement, with a ceiling up to 20% of the \nloan  amount.  The  Government  and  GOA  were  informed  that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does \nnot commit ADB to financing any of the proposed projects. \n   \nAvailability Period for the  The availability period will end on 30 June 2015, the date of the \nMFF  last disbursement under the MFF for any tranche.  \n   \nExecuting Agencies  GOA  and  ASEB  will  be  the  executing  agencies  with  overall \nresponsibility for execution of projects under the MFF. \n   \nImplementation  AEGCL  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  responsible  for \nArrangements  day-to-day implementation of projects for transmission systems, \n ", "vi \n \nand LAEDCL will be the Implementing Agency for distribution \nsystems. The project management unit (PMU) established under \nASEB  for  the  previous  ADB-supported  loan  (Loan  2037-IND: \nAssam Power Sector Development Program \u2013 Project Loan), will \nremain in place for the proposed projects under the MFF. The \nPMU  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  coordination  and \nadministration of the projects. \n \nProcurement  Goods, equipment, and civil works to be financed under each \nloan  of  the  MFF  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) in \naccordance with the related procurement plan. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  will  be  required  to  provide  AEGCL  and \nLAEDCL  with  support  for  project  implementation,  including \ndesign, supervision of construction, and management of projects \nunder each loan of the MFF. Consultants will be selected and \nengaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) in accordance \nwith the related procurement plan. \n   \nMFF Benefits and  Overall the MFF will contribute to state economic development \nBeneficiaries  on several fronts. The first group of beneficiaries will be local \nelectricity  consumers,  including  around  1  million  electrified \nhouseholds;  small-  and  medium-sized  businesses,  e.g.,  silk \nfactories;  hospitals;  and  schools.  The  second  group  of \nbeneficiaries includes all existing electricity consumers including \ndomestic users (51%), commercial users (10%), industrial users \n(27%),  agricultural  users  (2%),  and  others  (10%).  They  will \nbenefit  from  the  enhanced  power  operations.  Through  the \ndistribution  franchising  component,  720  entrepreneurs  are \nexpected  to  expand  their  operations  with  at  least  1,500  new \nemployees.  In  addition,  construction  of  infrastructure  and \ninstallation of information and communication technologies are \nexpected  to  create  at  least  500  jobs.  The  renewable  energy \ndevelopment component will provide a benefit for 2,100 villages \nwith off-grid renewable energy in the long term. Assam has a \nvery  high  incidence  of  poverty.  About  89%  of  the  state\u2019s \npopulation lives in rural areas, and approximately 60% of rural \nhouseholds  are  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The  rural \nelectrification component will have a direct benefit for the poor. \nThe Investment Program will rationalize tariffs as well as improve \nthe financial viability of the state\u2019s power industry. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Consistent  with  the  sector  assistance  program  evaluation \n  (SAPE)  recommendations,  ASEB  will  continue  to  receive \nconsulting support from a TA (the TA) attached to the investment \nprogram  for  capacity  development  of  APGCL,  AEGCL,  and \nLAEDCL to enhance general institutional capacity in the areas of \ncorporate management, human resource management, financial \nmanagement,  distribution  franchising,  and  renewable  energy \n ", "vii \ndevelopment. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.3 million \nequivalent. ADB will provide technical assistance not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $1.0 million. This will be financed by ADB, on a \ngrant basis, from the ADB\u2019s TA funding program TASF-Others. \nThe Government will provide the remaining balance equivalent of \n$300,000. ASEB will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The key assumption is that GOA will remain committed to the \nInvestment Program and the power reforms with the objective of \nproviding  power  for  all.  Other  important  assumptions  include \n(i) an adequate number of competent staff is available for ASEB, \nAEGCL, and LAEDCL; (ii) load growth in Assam continues as \nprojected;  (iii)  regulatory  mechanisms  and  interventions  are \nconsistent; and (iv) the TA is successfully implemented.   \n \nRisks include (i) an increase in the price of materials, and (ii) \nfailure  to  meet  safeguard  requirements  in  a  timely  manner. \nThese risks all appear to be low. The MFF is properly planned \nand sequenced with regard to the associated generation plan. \nSensitivity  analyses  of  the  MFF  indicate  that  it  is  resilient  to \nincreases in capital costs, and operation and maintenance costs. \nTechnical capability of the implementing agencies to implement \nthe MFF in a timely manner and in full compliance with ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard policies is proven.  \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Assam  Power  Sector  Enhancement \nInvestment Program. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (the TA) for \ncapacity  development  of  the  Assam  power  sector  utilities,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  India\u2019s economy has grown by 8% per annum in recent years, and faces rapidly growing \nenergy needs. Addressing the energy challenge is essential for fostering sustainable economic \ngrowth and reducing poverty. Taking into account India\u2019s energy security concerns, in 2006 the \nGovernment of India (the Government) developed the Integrated Energy Policy1 to ensure \nadequate  and  reliable  energy  supplies  in  a  technically  efficient,  economically  viable,  and \nenvironmentally sustainable manner. Specific measures include continuing related power sector \nreforms,  e.g.,  reducing  technical  and  commercial  losses  of  the  state  transmission  and \ndistribution (T&D) utilities and other restructuring efforts.   \n \n3.  Given the sub-optimal performance of state electricity boards and their negative impact \non efficient and effective delivery of power services to consumers, the Government adopted a \nprogram  of  unbundling  and  financial  restructuring  of  the  boards  in  the  late  1990s.  An \nindependent central regulatory body was established, and the formation of state regulatory \nbodies was made mandatory. The Electricity Act (2003) was intended to improve sector through \ncontinued institutional restructuring and improved management of sector entities to ensure  \nlong-term sustainability. Compulsory metering, open access to transmission systems, facilitation \nof power trading, and tariff rationalization were initiated. Separation of transmission from the \ntrading  function  was  made  obligatory.  Most  states  have  now  segregated  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution functions. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and \nstate electricity regulatory commissions have prescribed detailed tariff methodologies.  \n \n4.  At state level, the government of Assam (GOA) introduced the power sector reform \npolicy, Power Policy Statement 2003, aiming to (i) achieve commercial efficiency and financial \nviability of the power sector so that it does not require Assam\u2019s financial resources, which are \nneeded for socioeconomic development; (ii) improve delivery of services and cost-effectiveness \nthrough technical, managerial, and administrative restructuring of power utilities; (iii) increase \nthe operating efficiency of all the power utilities through competition, managerial autonomy, and \nhigher accountability; and (iv) create an environment that attracts private capital, both domestic \nand foreign, to supplement public sector investment. Appendix 2 provides an assessment of the \nAssam power sector.  \n \n5.

Unbundling of ASEB resulted in \nformation of Assam Power Generation Corporation Limited (APGCL); Assam Electricity Grid \nCorporation  Limited  (AEGCL);  and  three  distribution  companies:  Central  Assam  Electricity \nDistribution  Company  Limited  (CAEDCL),  Lower  Assam  Electricity  Distribution  Company \nLimited (LAEDCL), and Upper Assam Electricity Distribution Company Limited (UAEDCL).3 \nASEB remains active as a coordinating agency. GOA also implemented a financial restructuring \nplan (FRP) for debt restructuring. The APSDP provided transitional support to enable the newly \nformed utilities to commence operations with a clean balance sheet, and contributed to capacity \ndevelopment  of  the  Assam  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (AERC)  to  enhance  sector \ngovernance. Through physical capacity expansion, the APSDP project loan contributed to the \nsignificant reduction of T&D losses from 42.5% in 2003 to 35.0% in 2008; the installation of \n370,000  units  of  intelligent  and  downloadable  meters  with  tamper-proof  boxes,  and \nimprovement of village electrification. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Power Transmission \n6.  Over the last decade, peak unrestricted electricity demand in Assam increased by 44% \nfrom 587 megawatts (MW) in 1999 to 848 MW in 2008. The APSDP contributed to reducing \nserious peak power shortages from 18% to 10% during this period (Table 1).     \n \nTable 1: Demand Growth and Shortfall, 1999\u20132014 \nItem    1999  2000  2004  2008  2009  2011  2013  2014 \nUnrestricted demand (MW)       587  636  738  848  969   1,264  1,649  1,883 \nRestricted demand (MW)    482  505  635  766  912  1,213  1,616  1,883 \n% Shortfall    18  30  14  10  6  4  2  0 \nMW = megawatt. \nSources: Data from 2001\u20132008: Central Electricity Authority Assam power sector reports and Electric Power Survey \nprojections from 2009 are Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  Assam's peak power demand is forecasted to grow to 1,883 MW by 2014 with an annual \nincrease  of  14.2%.  To  meet  the  rapid  growth,  new  power  plants  will  be  constructed  and \ncommissioned by 2014 with sufficient additional capacity.  \n \n8.  While generation capacity is expected to soon catch up with expected demand, limited \ncapacity  of  the  Assam  state  T&D  system  can  continue  to  constrain  delivery  of  power  to \nconsumers. For example, a serious bottleneck of 38 MW from Lakwa natural gas and heat \nrecovery power plant to Guwahati (capital of Assam) prevents full operation of the clean power \nplant at peak hours. The current physical constraints in the transmission system mean that \nAssam residents are unable to fully access clean power, missing the opportunity to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The system master-plan study indicates an imminent need for \nsignificant investment in transmission to ensure that capacity addition in generation results in \npower that is available for input into the distribution system. \n  \n                                                                                                                                                          \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India for the Assam Power \nSector Project. Manila (Loan 2037-IND). \n3  The UAEDCL and LAEDCL were merged into LAEDCL as of 1 April 2009 to enhance operating efficiency. \n ", "3 \n \n2.  Access to Power and Poverty Reduction  \n9.  Inaccessibility to power due to distribution network constraints is a major impediment to \nAssam's  economic  growth.  The  lack  of  sufficient  and  reliable  power  is  eroding  the \ncompetitiveness of the state\u2019s manufacturing and agriculture industries, impacting food security, \nand  preventing  the  state  from  accessing  industrial  and  commercial  investments.  Improved \npower supply at a reasonable cost is, therefore, essential to boost the state economy and lead \nto overall poverty reduction. More importantly, access to power directly addresses poverty \nreduction  for  households.  Per  capita  annual  electricity  consumption  for  Assam  is  170  \nkilowatt-hours, only 27% of the national average. Per capita income in the state is $355, less \nthan two thirds of the national average. A very high proportion of the population is in rural (89%) \nand  approximately  30%  of  households  are  living  below  the  poverty  line,  compared  to  the \nnational average of 26%. Access to electricity in rural areas is crucial for human development. \nGOA, therefore, is highly committed to promoting rural electrification.  \n \n10.  GOA has a target of 100% village electrification by 2010, and 100% electricity access to \nhouseholds by 2012. Under the APSDP, village electrification improved from 58% in 2003 to \n77% in 2008, and household electrification from 17% in 2003 to 22% in 2008. Therefore, new \ninvestments in distribution must be targeted to expand the rural distribution system. In addition, \n2,145 remote villages in Assam cannot be electrified through the grid. GOA has a strategy to \nelectrify these villages by installing off-grid generation including renewable and conventional \nenergy.   \n3.  Transmission and Distribution Loss Reduction   \n11.  One of the major outcomes of the APSDP was significant aggregate technical and \ncommercial (ATC) loss reduction from 42.5% in 2003 to 35.0% in 2008. Transmission loss was \nreduced  from  9.0%  to  6.0%,  and  distribution  technical  loss  from  18.0%  to  12.5%;  both \ncontributed to reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by 0.48 million tons carbon dioxide  \n(t-CO ) equivalent. However, current ATC loss is still higher than the national average of 28%. \n2\nEnergy efficiency must be enhanced if the Government's target of 15% ATC loss is to be met.  \n \n12.  The distribution network in Assam is characterized by overloaded transformers and long \ndistribution feeders, thereby increasing distribution losses to 55%\u201360% in some areas. The \nchallenge for the T&D systems is the inadequate infrastructure and capabilities to accurately \nmeasure and monitor losses at each point. Furthermore, while many distribution transformers \nare metered, micro energy accounting is not possible because of the lack of consumer indexing \nand linkage with the distribution transformers. Under the APSDP, 370,000 units of intelligent \nand downloadable meters with tamper-proof boxes were installed across the state. However, \nthe magnitude of the impact of such meter replacement has been limited as meter reading is still \nundertaken manually. Also, certain special features of these meters that can reduce human \ninterference  in  meter  reading  have  not  been  fully  activated  because  of  the  absence  of \ninformation technology systems in distribution utilities. Addressing such capacity and training \nrequirements in distribution utilities will have a significant impact on commercial loss reduction. \n \n4.  Sector and Corporate Governance    \n13.  Cognizant of weak sector and corporate governance, GOA initiated power sector reform \nin 2001 in tandem with the APSDP. This resulted in tangible outcomes, i.e., (i) enhanced legal, \npolicy, and regulatory framework; and (ii) unbundling of ASEB.  \n \n ", "4   \n \n   \n14.  Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Framework. Throughout the reform process, AERC, an \nindependent state regulatory agency formed in 2001, has adopted a realistic and supportive \nposition through its regulatory initiatives, e.g., (i) notification of the terms and conditions of the \ntariff in 2005, (ii) issuance of regularly updated tariff orders for the utilities attempting to focus on \ncost-recovery aspects, and (iii) notification of standards of performance for T&D licensees in \n2004. In 2009, AERC initiated multiyear tariff proceedings to enhance efficiency improvements \nand predictability in cost and tariff setting.  \n \n15.  Unbundling of Assam State Electricity Board. In 2002, ASEB, under the Companies \nAct (1956), incorporated the successor entities: APGCL, AEGCL, and three distribution utilities. \nThrough the transfer scheme, the existing assets of generation, transmission, and distribution \nwere transferred to these utilities. ASEB remains active as a coordinating agency. Despite the \nphysical  unbundling,  institutional,  managerial,  and  financial  sustainability  is  undermined  by \nlimited corporate governance of the successor entities (Figure 1). Due to this constraint, ASEB \nis  responsible  for  centralized  corporate  strategy,  and  financial  and  human  resource \nmanagement.  Capacity  development  is  required  for  the  unbundled  structure  to  be  fully \noperationalized.  \n \n \nFigure 1: Unbundling of Assam State Electricity Board \n \nStage 1 (Pre 2003) Stage 2 (2009) Stage 3 \n     \nASEB\nASEB (Coordinating Agency)\nGeneration Generation  Generation \nTransmission Transmission Transmission\nDistribution Distribution Distribution\nUnbundled Entity  Company separation completed Company separation exists\nAll functions carried out by ASEB Several functions supported by ASEB Utilities responsible for own functions\n \nKey Transmission and\n Distribution Functions  Observations\nPower Procurement Long, medium, and short term power procurement and trading undertaken by ASEB\n Investment Planning Investment planning, studies for access, and efficiency improvement needs ASEB support \nOperation and Maintenance Utilities are responsible for this function\n Financial Management Cash management, budgeting, and investment management undertaken by ASEB\n HR Management Officer recruitment, training, promotions, and appraisals undertaken by ASEB  \nRegulatory Interfacing Decisions on regulatory directives, compliance taken with ASEB support\nFranchisee Management Decision on SPSS rollout, SPSS management, PPP models with ASEB support\nCustomer Service Utilities are responsible for this function\n         \nLegend:  \n     Function completely managed by ASEB   Utilities largely supported by ASEB\n     Partially managed by successor utilities   Largely managed by successor utilities\n     Managed completely by successor utilities  \n \nASEB = Assam State Electricity Board; HR = Human Resources; PPP = public private partnership; SPSS = single \npoint power supply \nSource(s):  Annual reports of Assam State Electricity Board. \n16.  Financial Restructuring Plan. Achieving financial sustainability of the sector is a key \nobjective of GOA's power sector reforms. Prior to unbundling, ASEB\u2019s high-cost structure, e.g., \nsub-optimal billing and collection, significantly undermined its financial health. Chronic defaults \non payments to most of its creditors and suppliers resulted in a large burden of accumulated \ndebts.  To  restore  the  financial  viability  of  the  power  sector,  GOA  initiated  a  financial \nrestructuring  plan  (FRP)  in  2003,  focusing  on  debt  restructuring  and  transitional  financial \n ", "5 \n \nsupport to enable the new companies to start with a clean slate. The FRP indicated that ASEB \nwould require transitional support to meet a projected shortfall of Rs2.71 billion. The FRP \ninvolved a total restructuring adjustment of Rs45.6 billion, comprising a noncash settlement of \nRs34.0 billion and Rs11.6 billion for liabilities involving cash settlement. Supported by the \nAPSDP, GOA successfully completed the FRP in 2008.  \n17.  With  successful  completion  of  the  FRP,  the  financial  position  of  ASEB  improved \nsignificantly. Tariffs and costs gradually converged from 2003 to 2007 resulting in cost coverage \nof 85% in 2007 (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Financial Performance of Assam State Electricity Board \nFinancials  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nTotal Revenue (Rs billion)   8.35  8.88  10.13  10.95  11.59 \nTotal Expenditure (Rs billion)   12.30  13.20  11.17  11.85  11.91 \nAverage Cost (Rs/unit) (A)  6.27  6.72  5.63  5.18  5.29 \nAverage Tariff (Rs/unit) (B)  3.85  4.23  4.17  4.46  4.51 \nCost Coverage (B)/(A)         61%         63%          74%          86%           85% \nBilling Efficiency          64%         63%          65%          67%           69% \nCollection Efficiency          96%         94%          98%          97%         100% \n        Sources: Annual reports of Assam State Electricity Board. \n \n5.  Assam Transmission and Distribution Sector Road Map \n18.  The  Assam  Transmission  and  Distribution  Sector  Road  Map,  linked  with  the \nTransmission and Distribution Sector Investment Program (the Investment Program) aims to  \n(i)  strengthen  power  transmission  capacity  to  deliver  reliable,  and  affordable  electricity;  \n(ii) improve access to electricity, e.g., off-grid rural electrification with appropriate sources;  \n(iii) enhance efficiency and quality of power supply; (iv) fully operationalize the unbundled \nutilities; and (v) promote private sector participation through innovative distribution franchising \nmodels.  \n \n6.  Lessons \n19.  In 2002/03, ADB conducted project performance audits of energy projects in India.4 \nLessons identified include (i) sector restructuring should be implemented gradually rather than \nattempting quick reform through project covenants, (ii) land acquisition should be carried out \nexpeditiously  to  minimize  implementation  delays,  and  (iii)  construction  contracts  should  be \nproperly packaged to simplify procurement and facilitate project implementation. A detailed list \nof ADB assistance to the sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The  2007  energy  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  (SAPE)5 for  India  identified \nlessons and areas where the Government, ADB, the private sector, and other stakeholders can \nwork together to more effectively achieve sector development goals. The main lessons are  \n(i) ADB\u2019s approach to state lending has worked well and should be used as a model for future \nassistance;  (ii)  sustained  TA  is  needed  to  support  state  reform  programs;  and  \n(iii) corporatization is providing benefits similar to those normally attributed to privatization, as \nthe  introduction  of  commercially  and  financially  sustainable  principles  to  state  entities  can \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.

In particular, in Assam \nthe SAPE identified specific lessons, for example, (i) ASEB will continue to need consulting \nsupport; (ii) capacities of the new companies need to be developed in many areas, including \nfinance, information technology, human resources, and core engineering; (iii) for utilities with \nlimited internal capacity, such as ASEB, consultant support to help the utility utilize ADB funds \nneeds  to  be  brought  into  place  more  quickly;  (iv)  work  on  performance  improvement, \norganization restructuring, and human resource issues could beneficially be brought forward \nearlier in the program; and (v) the Assam experience makes a clear case for the use of \ndemonstration projects where management and technological changes can deliver a better \ncustomer-focused service. \n \n21.  These experiences are reflected in the design and preparation of the proposed MFF and \nlessons were incorporated into project selection and preparation of procurement packages, \nwhich are consistent with the project readiness criteria agreed between the Government and \nADB.6 Details on project readiness for the first tranche of the MFF are in Appendix 4. \n \n7.  Asian Development Bank Strategy  \n22.  ADB assistance to support energy initiatives in India has six main priorities: (i) promote \nhigher efficiency, low-carbon energy sources, cleaner fuel, and renewable energy; (ii) expand \nand optimize T&D systems; (iii) support sector reforms; (iv) provide institutional strengthening to \nimplement reforms required by the Electricity Act, including development of more flexible power \ndelivery and trading systems; (v) promote private sector participation; (vi) encourage energy \nefficiency, energy conservation, and rural electrification; and (vii) ensure environmental and \nsocial sustainability. ADB will continue to expand its promotion of and support for power reforms \nand intensify its efforts in states where it is already active, such as Assam, Gujarat, Himachal \nPradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. The interventions will promote knowledge transfer \nin relation to best practices in the international power sector, improve corporate governance in \nstate-owned utilities, and ensure that appropriate environmental and social safeguards are \nincorporated into new power investments. The proposed intervention in Assam is consistent \nwith the strategy of supporting state sector reforms, in this case with the emphasis on T&D. \n  \n8.  External Assistance \n23.  The  power  sector  in  India  has  received  assistance  from  various  international \ndevelopment partners. Japan International Cooperation Agency and the World Bank have been \nthe major sources of external funding, focusing on reforms in generation, facility rehabilitation \nand improvement, and development of renewable energy resources. German development \ncooperation through KfW and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) are also assisting \nthe  sector.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  and  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom provide technical assistance support. ADB \nhas consulted with the World Bank and AFD which have considered provision of assistance for \nthe Assam T&D sector. ADB will continue consultation and coordination with development \npartners during project implementation.         \n \n                                                 \n6  The Government and ADB jointly agree to follow a set of prerequisites to assure smooth implementation of \nprojects.  Under  these  project-readiness  criteria,  ASEB  must  be  ready  to  award  at  least  30%  of  contracts \nimmediately after loan effectiveness. \n ", "7 \n \n9.  Policy Dialogue \n24.  Full Operationalization of the Unbundled Power Utilities. GOA is committed to full \noperationalization of the unbundled utilities: APGCL, AEGCL, and LAEDCL. ASEB\u2019s role is \nexpected to cease once the utilities have a cash surplus and are sufficiently empowered to carry \nout their own corporate strategy, and financial and human resource management functions.  \n25.  Energy Efficiency Enhancement. GOA is aware that energy efficiency potential to \nbridge  supply  gaps,  specifically  in  distributed  and  decentralized  generation  application,  is \nsubstantially unrealized. The main sources of this potential are conservation and demand-side \nmanagement, and supply-side energy efficiency enhancement measures.  \n26.  Comprehensive  Governance  Measures.  ADB's  intervention  will  support  sector \nenhancement  and  corporate  governance  through  creation  of  an  efficient  and  commercially \noriented culture. In particular, ADB\u2019s capacity development component will support organization \nand  governance  efforts;  enhance  capacity  to  manage  physical  and  financial  construction \nactivities; and provide management and financial reporting to meet GOA and ADB accounting, \nasset management, and reporting requirements.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM  \n \n27.  The Investment Program will directly address sector issues based on the achievement of \nthe APSDP, which has successfully created the enabling environment leading to inclusive \neconomic  growth  through  power  sector  reforms  and  physical  capacity  expansion.  The \nInvestment Program is a logical extension of the APSDP with further strengthening of the T&D \nsystem and enhancement of institutional capacity. It will require 5 years for full implementation, \nand will require flexibility in project selection to achieve overall objectives and mitigate risk. An \nMFF is particularly well suited for the Investment Program because (i) its aim is to support \nGOA\u2019s long-term objectives, as stated in the T&D road map; (ii) the performance of ongoing \nprojects under the MFF can guide the provision of subsequent loans, thereby offering proper \nincentives  for  implementation;  and  (iii)  an  MFF  can  offer  the  flexibility  required  for  the \nInvestment Program to support the participation of utilities at different stages of readiness.   \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n28.  The impact of the Investment Program will be a sustainable state power sector with \nincreased T&D capacity to support inclusive economic growth. The outcome will be enhanced \nquality and expanded service delivery of electricity through improved technical, commercial, and \nfinancial performance and capability of power utilities. \n \nB.  Outputs \n29.  The MFF supports following outputs of the Investment Program (Appendix 5):  \n(i)  Access to power. The transmission component includes capacity addition in \ntransmission  lines,  transformation  capacities,  and  a  communication  system. \nTransmission lines will be expanded by 365 kilometers (km) at 220 kV and  \n242 km at 132 kV. Construction of 3 new 220/132 kV substations and 11 new \n132/33  kV  substations  is  included.  The  distribution  component  includes \nconstruction  of  new  substations,  augmentation  of  existing  substations,  and \naddition of new distribution lines. About 20 new distribution substations will be \nconstructed and 10 existing substations will be augmented.  \n ", "8   \n \n   \n(ii)  Energy efficiency enhancement: T&D loss reduction. The transmission loss \nreduction  component  includes  replacement  of  inefficient  transformers,  circuit \nbreakers,  relays,  and  isolators;  extension  and  augmentation  of  existing \ntransmission substations; and investment in reactive power compensation. The \ndistribution loss  reduction  component  includes  expansion  of  the  high-voltage \ndistribution system and installation of aerial bunched cables.  \n(iii)  Distribution  franchising.  Under  the  APSDP,  the  single  point  power  supply \n(SPPS) program for distribution franchising was developed. Partnerships with \ncommunity-based  private  sector  groups  and  nongovernment  organizations, \nselected through competitive bidding process, buy electricity from LAEDCL at \nbulk import points and supply it to consumers in the franchisee areas. Under the \nSPPS  program,  the  commercial,  minor  investment,  and  operation  and \nmaintenances  activities  are  outsourced.  The  SPPS  program  has  enhanced \npower  sector  governance  by  increasing  participation,  competition,  and \ntransparency; and improved sector financial viability. ADB witnessed a case that \nSPPS had a positive impact on poverty reduction through creation of a better \nworking  environment,  education,  and  health  care.  The  proposed  distribution \ncomponent will expand the franchisee program to double consumer coverage \nwith support for (i) physical investments, e.g., last-mile distribution lines and bulk \nmetering, and (ii) nonphysical investment, e.g., training programs for franchisees \nand LAEDCL through the TA.   \n(iv)  Renewable  energy  development.  The  distributed  decentralized  generation \n(DDG) component includes consultancy services through the TA to identify and \ndevelop  pilot  projects  for  off-grid  rural  electrification  with  renewable  and \nconventional  energy,  e.g.,  mini-hydropower,  biomass,  and  solar  power \ngeneration.   \n(v)  Capacity development. The component along with the TA includes consultancy \nservices and training programs for ASEB, APGCL, AEGCL, and LAEDCL, among \nothers,  to  develop  their  institutional  capacity  for  project  planning  and \nmanagement,  corporate  strategy,  and  human  and  financial  resource \nmanagement.  \nC.  Technical Justification and Eligibility Criteria \n30.  Transmission components form part of AEGCL\u2019s least-cost expansion plan. Its planning \nprocess uses investment signals provided through the national demand forecast produced by \nthe Central Electricity Authority (CEA), and state energy and demand forecasts produced with \nthe assistance of LAEDCL. Distribution components were modeled and analyzed using power \nsystems analysis software. Best practice design standards and construction techniques will be \napplied to all investments.   \n \n31.  The following criteria will be used to select projects: \n \n(i)  All projects should be economically and financially viable. \n(ii)  Project  designs  will  be  consistent  with  overall  least-cost  expansion  plans; \ndesigned on a least-cost basis; and reflect \u201cbest practice\u201d design, construction, \nand operation and maintenance features. Subprojects will display performance-\nbased design consistent with international benchmarks for system efficiency and \noperating risk. \n ", "9 \n \n(iii)  Project  designs  will  be  consistent  with  the  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP), resettlement framework, and indigenous people development framework \n(IPDF).  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  and  indigenous  people \ndevelopment plans (based on the agreed IPDF and the resettlement framework) \nwill  be  prepared  as  necessary  for  additional  projects  before  ADB  approves \nfunding. \n(iv)  All  projects  require  environmental  assessments  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). Category A projects will require an environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  and  category  B  projects  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE). Summaries of the EIA and IEE for category A and B-sensitive \nprojects must be prepared and made available to the public 120 days before a \nperiodic financing request (PFR) is submitted to ADB. An EMP, with a budget, \nwill be prepared for each project. \n \nD.  Special Features \n32.   Poverty  Reduction  through  Public\u2013Private  Partnership.  The  SPPS  program  in \nAssam is based on an input-based franchisee model concept where the distribution licensee is \nresponsible for providing power at a bulk supply point and the franchisee is responsible for \nbilling and collection from consumers (Appendix 6). The franchisee retains a pre-set margin and \npasses  on the  remaining  collection  to  LAEDCL.  Based on  the success  demonstrated,  the \nfranchisee program would be expanded to double consumer coverage through (i) physical \ninvestment, i.e., provision of better last-mile infrastructure by LAEDCL that could reduce losses \nand improve efficiency; and (ii) nonphysical investment, i.e., capacity development programs to \nfranchisees and LAEDCL to enhance management practices. In addition, further empowerment \nto franchises will be explored by feasibility studies and development of a second generation \ndistribution franchisee model with (i) more responsibilities for downstream distribution-related \nactivities,  e.g.,  capital  investment,  and  expanded  operation  and  maintenance  activities;  \n(ii) expansion of service in urban and larger areas; and (iii) development of risk-sharing models.  \n   \n33.  Off-Grid Rural Electrification mainly with Renewable Energy. Similar to the SPPS \nprogram  for  grid-connected  villages,  the  model  for  off-grid  rural  electrification  mainly  with \nrenewable energy will be developed under the TA. The Assam Energy Development Agency, \nthe nodal agency for renewable energy development, identified 2,000 villages suitable for solar \nphotovoltaic  power  generation  in  remote  villages.  GOA  has  identified  90  potential  \nmini-hydropower sites with total capacity of 148.5 MW and ratified the Small Hydro Power Policy \nin 2007 defining the project formulation structure where private sector groups will be selected \nthrough competitive bidding processes. The TA will develop pilot-testing projects of renewable \nenergy, e.g., mini-hydropower, solar, and biomass; and structure the relevant operating model.   \n \n34.  Strategic System Loss Reduction Program. Cognizant that the ad-hoc measures for \ntechnical and commercial loss reduction have been not effective, a strategic approach with \nadvanced information technology and communication systems will be undertaken by combining \nphysical  and  nonphysical  investment  in  tandem  with  the  national  Government\u2019s  planed \nRestructured Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme initiative. To pinpoint \nthe  causes  of  system  loss  at  each  location,  an  information  technology-based  integrated \napproach will be used to establish baseline data and information technology applications for \nenergy  accounting  and  auditing.  Then,  an  optimal  solution,  e.g.,  system  improvement, \nstrengthening, and augmentation of the distribution infrastructure, will be conducted at each \npoint.  \n \n ", "10  \n \n   \n35.  Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity Reduction. The Investment Program is expected \nto  reduce  the  intensity  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  and  other  emissions  due  to  avoided \ngeneration via improved system efficiency.  \n \nE.  Program Investment Plan \n36.  The largest component of the Investment Program amounting to $764 million is access \nto  power  (transmission)  and  energy  efficiency  enhancement  (transmission  loss  reduction), \naccounting for $561.6 million of planned investment (73.5%). This is followed by $150.0 million \nfor access to power (distribution), energy efficiency enhancement (distribution loss reduction) \nand distribution franchising (19.6%) and $50.0 million for distributed decentralized generation \nmainly  with  renewable  energy  (6.5%)  (Table  3).  The  Investment  Program  also  includes  \n$3.4 million for a capacity building program (including $1.0 million TA) to meet the sector\u2019s \nincreasing management capacity requirements.  \n \nTable 3: Investment Program, 2009\u20132014 \nFacility \nInvestment  Related \n($ million)  Program  Projects  Tranche 1 \nTransmission  561.6 237.0 92.6\nDistribution  150.0 75.2 0.0\nCapacity Development a  2.4 2.4 2.4\nDistributed Decentralized Generation  50.0 0.0 0.0\nTotal  764.0 314.6 95.0\n            a The Investment Program does not include TA \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Financing Plan \n37.  The financing plan for 2009\u20132014 is shown in Table 4 below. The Government has \nrequested  financing  of  up  to  $200,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help \nfinance part of the Investment Program covering (i) access to power and energy efficiency \nenhancement  in  transmission,  (ii)  access  to  power  and  energy  efficiency  enhancement  in \ndistribution  and  distribution  franchising,  (iii)  capacity  development,  and  (iv)  distributed \ndecentralized generation. ADB\u2019s participation as a partner (i) reduces the cost of funds, (ii) \nestablishes standards in various thematic areas, and (iii) helps attract other long-term financiers \nto the sector. In addition, the TA will support, among others, renewable energy development.  \n \nTable 4: Financing Program, 2009\u20132014 \nFacility \nInvestment  Related \n($ million)  Program  Projects  Tranche 1 \nADB  200.0 200.0 60.3 \nWorld Bank a  360.0 0.0 0.0 \nGovernment of Assam  154.0 114.6 34.7 \nPrivate Sector  50.0 0.0 0.0 \nTotal  764.0 314.6 95.0 \na $764.0 million includes the investment for the Assam portion under the Government's Composite \nScheme of development of transmission and distribution in NER.

The  financing  will  be  provided  under  an  MFF  as  requested  by  the  Government  in \naccordance  with  ADB  policy.7 The  Government  has  entered  into  a  framework  financing \nagreement (FFA) for purposes of availing of loans under the MFF and is required to comply with \nthe FFA requirements. The MFF will extend loans to finance a range of projects under the \nInvestment Program, subject to the Government submitting a related PFR and executing the \nrelated loan and project agreements. Each PFR will be accompanied by a detailed cost estimate \nand an implementation schedule. The loans under the MFF will finance equipment supply and \nerection, consulting services, and other capacity-building activities. The minimum amount of a \nPFR will be $50 million.  \n \n39.  All provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based loans8 will apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that \nmight be included under any loan and project agreement. The specific terms of each loan will be \nbased on the related PFR, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  If  the  Government  requests  any \ncofinancing arrangements or related assistance for projects financed by the MFF, ADB may \nassist with these, subject to related ADB policy and procedures. The Government will provide \nthe proceeds of the loans under the MFF in local currency to GOA and through GOA to ASEB. \nThe Government will bear the foreign exchange risk on the loans. \n \n40.  Tranche 1 of the MFF amounting to $60.3 million will finance a set of projects that \nincludes (i) access to power (transmission) for capacity addition in transmission lines of 220 kV \n(180 km) and 132 kV (82 km), and capacity addition of transformation through construction of 1 \nnew  220/132  kV  substation  and  5  new  132/33  kV  substations;  and  (ii)  energy  efficiency \nenhancement  (loss  reduction)  for  extension  and  augmentation  of  2  existing  substations. \nTranche 1 will also include a capacity development component (Appendix 7 provides cost \nestimates and Appendix 8 the implementation schedule).   \n   \n41.  Tranche 2 of the MFF, indicative amount of $89.7 million, is expected to finance a set of \nprojects that includes (i) access to power (transmission) for capacity addition in transmission \nlines of 220 kV (185 km) and 132 kV (160 km), and capacity addition of transformation through \nconstruction of 2 new 220/132 kV substations and 6 new 132/33 kV substations; and (ii) energy \nefficiency  enhancement  (loss  reduction)  for  extension  and  augmentation  of  11  existing \nsubstations  through  14  subprojects.  Tranche  2  will  also  finance  refurbishment  of  existing \nsubstations and installation of reactive power compensation equipment of 130 MVAR (megavolt \nampere reactive).  \n \n42.  Tranche 3 of the MFF, indicative amount of 50.0 million, is expected to finance a set of \nprojects comprising distribution components for (i) access to power (distribution), (ii) energy \nefficiency  enhancement  (loss  reduction),  and  (iii)  distribution  franchising.  This  component \nincludes construction of new distribution substations and lines.

Implementation Arrangements \n43.  Executing  and  Implementing  Agencies.  GOA  and  ASEB  will  be  the  executing \nagencies with overall responsibility for execution of the MFF and projects under the MFF. \nAEGCL  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of \ntransmission projects, and LAEDCL will be the Implementing Agency responsible for distribution \nsystem  projects.  AEGCL  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  tranche  1  (The  AEGCL \norganization structure is presented in Appendix 9). A project management unit (PMU), headed \nby a full-time project director, established under ASEB for the APSDP project (footnote 2), will \nremain  in  place  for  the  MFF  with  responsibility  for  day-to-day  project  coordination  and \nadministration. Since the PMU staff of ASEB has substantial experience with implementing the \nprevious ADB-financed project, they are fully conversant with ADB guidelines and procedures. \nThe MFF implementation organization chart is in Appendix 10. \n \n44.  Implementation  Period.  The  MFF  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  including \nprocurement and construction activities. Each specific loan will have its own closing date to \nmatch the implementation period of the project(s) funded under that loan.  \n \n45.  Projects Management. ASEB will appraise additional projects following approval of the \nMFF.  It  will  also  undertake  detailed  design,  procurement,  construction  supervision, \ncommissioning, maintenance, and operation of the projects. ASEB will liaise with ADB on a \nregular basis. The PMU will be responsible for tracking, identification, appraisal, detailed design \nand  procurement  for  additional  projects  (particularly  for  tranche  3);  and  providing  timely \nfeedback to ASEB and ADB on consequences of project delays. It will be assisted by technical \nexperts who will evaluate the technical reports, feasibility studies, preliminary design reports, \nenvironmental assessment reports, resettlement and indigenous peoples development plans, \nand detailed design reports to ensure compliance with ADB and Government requirements. \nSummary appraisal reports will be submitted to ADB, subsequent to GOA approval and required \nGovernment clearances.  \n \n46.  Performance  Monitoring,  Evaluation,  and  Progress  Reporting.  The  PMU,  in \ncoordination with AEGCL and LAEDCL, will establish a performance monitoring system for the \nMFF  and  for  each  project.  The  performance  reports  for  each  project  will  be  compiled  for \npreparation of the MFF performance reporting. Project completion reports will be prepared for \neach project within 6 months of project completion, and an MFF completion report will be \nprepared within 6 months of MFF completion. The PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports \nand submit these to ADB within 30 days of the end of each quarter. These reports will include  \n(i) a narrative description of progress made during the period; (ii) changes in the implementation \nschedule; (iii) problems or difficulties encountered; (iv) work to be carried out during the next \nperiod; (v) progress on environmental and social compliance; (vi) a report on implementation of \nthe EMPs for all environment category A projects and all environmentally sensitive category B \nprojects; and (vii) compliance with conditions of the individual loan and project agreements. The \nprogress reports will include project expenditures during the period and total expenditures to \ndate. Performance will be evaluated on the basis of indicators and targets stipulated in the \ndesign and monitoring framework. The ADB project team will prepare periodic and annual \nreports to inform ADB\u2019s Board of Directors of overall progress, and supplemental progress \nreports prior to management approval of individual loan agreements. \n \n47.  Review. ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the first loan approval. \nADB will review implementation and operations based on the quarterly progress reports and \nmeet with ASEB and GOA semiannually to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review, \n ", "13 \n \nto be carried out 2 years after loan effectiveness for each project, will focus on engineering, \nresettlement, and environmental aspects of the ADB-supported investments; and review the \nfinancial status of ASEB, AEGCL, and LAEDCL. Representatives of ADB, GOA, ASEB, AEGCL, \nand LAEDCL, will take part in the review. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse \ncorrections  to  ensure  successful  implementation  and  achievement  of  objectives.  For  all \nenvironment category A projects and all environmentally sensitive category B projects, review \nmissions from the ADB regional department will conduct an annual review of environmental \naspects. A project completion report will be submitted within 6 months following completion of \nthe individual loans. A facility completion report will be prepared within 6 months after the \ncompletion of all ADB-supported activities and projects under the MFF. \n \n48.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation. ASEB and the implementing agencies \nconsulted with stakeholders, including affected communities, during the design stage. During \nthe preparatory stages of the tranche 1 project, consultations were carried out with various \nstakeholders and government officials concerned. Local communities were consulted as part of \nthe social and resettlement study to gather their views on the proposed projects under tranche \n1. All affected people were consulted on a one-to-one basis through questionnaire surveys. \nAdditionally,  focus  group  discussions  were  conducted  within  the  project  influence  areas. \nConsultations  will  continue  during  the  entire  project  cycle  according  to  a  stakeholder \nparticipation  plan.  Stakeholder  participation  and  public  consultation  will  continue  during \npreparatory work for second and/or third tranche projects. \n \n49.  Procurement. Goods, equipment, and civil works to be financed under the MFF will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and the related procurement plan. A procurement plan for the projects to be financed \nunder tranche 1, indicating the detailed thresholds of each procurement method, is in Appendix \n11. The procurement plan will be updated annually as required to cover the next 18 months. \n \n50.  Consulting Services. Consulting services will be required to provide ASEB and the \nimplementing  agencies  with  assistance  for  project  implementation,  including  design, \nconstruction supervision, and management of the projects under each loan of the MFF; as well \nas ASEB's processing work and PFR preparation for future loans. Consulting services will be \nprovided for evaluation, monitoring, and reporting purposes. Consultants will be selected and \nengaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) in accordance with the procurement plan.  \n \n51.  Disbursement Arrangements. Disbursements of loan proceeds under the MFF will be \nmade in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Each PFR will result in a separate loan agreement, which will describe the detailed \ndisbursement arrangements agreed on by the Government, GOA, ASEB, and ADB. As may be \nrequired under the MFF for any loan, the Government may create an imprest account in the \nReserve Bank of India, and may allow the state and/or ASEB to create a second generation \nimprest account to ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and implementation. In such \ncases, the amount in the imprest account or the second generation imprest account at any \ngiven time should not exceed the amount equivalent to 6 months of estimated expenditures or \n10% of the related loan amount, whichever is less. The imprest account and second generation \nimprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. Individual payments under the statement of expenditures procedure, if \nany, for the loan will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. \n \n ", "14  \n \n   \n52.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing. To expedite implementation, the \nGovernment,  GOA,  and  ASEB  requested  ADB  approval  to  carry  out  advance  actions  for \nprocurement of works and goods, and recruitment of consultants. This advance procurement \naction is intended to be used for all tranches of the MFF. The Government, GOA, and ASEB \nalso requested retroactive financing of up to 20% of the loan amount for each tranche under the \nMFF. Accordingly advance contracting for procurement and consulting services is proposed for \nprojects  under  the  MFF.  Similarly  retroactive  financing  of  expenditures  for  the  first  and \nsubsequent tranches up to 20% of the proceeds from the individual loans under the MFF is \nproposed, provided that those expenditures are eligible in accordance with applicable ADB \npolicies and procedures, and were incurred before effectiveness of the corresponding individual \nloan agreement, but not earlier than 12 months preceding the signing of each loan agreement. \nThe Government, GOA, and ASEB were informed that approval of advance contracting or \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any of the proposed projects. Each PFR \nwill specify the nature of expenditure, if retroactive financing is required. The Government was \nalso informed that ADB will not finance expenditures paid by the borrower prior to effectiveness \nof the individual loan agreement, even if advance contracting was approved, unless ADB has \napproved retroactive financing. \n \n53.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Financial  Reporting.  ASEB  and  the  implementing \nagencies will maintain separate accounts for each project and for its overall operations. ASEB \nwill have such accounts (including imprest accounts) and related financial statements (balance \nsheet,  statement  of  income  and  expenses,  and  related  statements)  audited  annually,  in \naccordance with appropriate auditing standards consistently applied, by independent auditors \nwhose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. ASEB and the \nimplementing agencies will provide ADB with certified copies of such audited accounts and \nfinancial statements, and the relating report of the auditors no later than 6 months after the \nclose of the fiscal year. This will include the auditors' opinion on the use of loan proceeds, on \ncompliance with the covenants of the legal agreement(s), on the use of the imprest accounts, \nand on the use of the procedures for statement of expenditures. ASEB and the implementing \nagencies will provide ADB with such further information concerning such accounts, financial \nstatements, and the audit as ADB will from time to time reasonably request. \n \n54.  Anticorruption  Policy.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nprojects and components under the MFF. In this regard, investigation of government officials, if \nany, would be requested by ADB to be undertaken by the Government. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are included in \nthe loan regulations and the bidding documents for the projects under the MFF. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the MFF shall include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of ASEB and the implementing \nagencies; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the projects and components under the MFF. \n \n55.  Governance Measures. ADB\u2019s intervention will support full corporatization of the utilities \ninto efficient, commercially oriented companies. ADB\u2019s capacity development component will \nsupport organizational and governance efforts; and will enhance capacity of ASEB and the \nutilities  to  manage  both  the  physical  and  financial  construction  activities,  and  provide \nmanagement and financial reporting to meet GOA and ADB accounting, asset management, \nand  reporting  requirements.  On  managing  physical  construction  activities,  use  of  ADB \nguidelines on procurement and consulting services and standard bidding documents will provide \n ", "15 \n \nan opportunity for better monitoring. Bid specifications and packaging will ensure maximum \ncompetition. For managing financial activities, recruitment of additional financial management \nexperts and enhancement of internal control systems, supported with advanced information and \ncommunication technology-based financial management systems, will ensure efficiency and \naccountability. Independent auditors will audit the financial statements. Measurable financial \nperformance indicators are being set; AERC will evaluate these. ADB review missions will \nreview accounting and control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial transactions \nof  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and  ensure  safe  custody  of  project-financed \nassets. Table 5 summarizes the specific governance measures.   \n \nTable 5: Governance Measures \nArea  Measure \nProcurement  Provide information on procurement contract updates on websites and at project sites. \nStrengthen the PMU by appointing a senior officer as PMU head directly reporting to the ASEB \nchairperson.  \nADB to provide seminars and training program on procurement.  \nUse ADB guidelines on procurement and consulting services for all tranches of the MFF. \nUse ADB standard bidding documents and standard request for proposal documents for  \nprocurement and recruitment of consultants. \nPrepare bid specifications and packaging to ensure maximum competition under international \ncompetitive bidding procedures.  \nFinancial  Provide capacity development of ASEB, AEGCL, and LAEDCL in accounting and   internal \nManagement  control systems; financial management; and internal audit capabilities, including    expanded use \nand Audit  of computerized financial management systems and recruitment of qualified staff. \nEnsure scope of internal audit of ASEB, AEGCL, and LAEDCL includes revenue audit and \ninternal audit reports to the audit committee of ASEB. \nIndependent auditors acceptable to ADB to audit financial statements. \nInstitutional  Continue introduction of a corporate culture within ASEB, AEGCL, LAEDCL, through further     \nand/or  commercialization (part of capacity development program). \nCorporate  Ensure sector regulatory body is fully functional to improve sector governance. \nGovernance  Enhance capacity of LAEDCL to promote the SPPS scheme. \nAnticorruption  ADB will review and examine any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \n  relating to projects and components. \nInvestigation of government officials, if any, would be requested by ADB to be undertaken by the \nGovernment.  \nProvide  public  disclosure  of  operating  and  financial  performance  of  ASEB,  AEGCL,  and \nLAEDCL for transparency. \nDisclose information pertinent to the projects to the general public.  \nProvide capacity development of ASEB and the implementing agencies to increase transparency \nand accountability. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AEGCL = Assam Electricity Grid Corporation Limited, ASEB = Assam State \nElectricity Board, LAEDCL = Lower Assam Electricity Distribution Company Limited, MFF = multitranche financing \nfacility, PMU = project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank assessment. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n56.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  was  conducted  in  May  2009  (Supplementary \nAppendix F). Major findings include (i) executing and implementing agencies are familiar with \nprevious  ADB  standard  bidding  procedures  based  on  procurement  experiences  with  the \nprevious project, (ii) experience and knowledge or local procurement process for Government of \nIndia projects is sufficient, and (iii) only a limited number of staff have the capacity to handle \ninternational procurement for projects funded by multilateral development banks. The sector \nassistance  program  evaluation  recommends  that  (i)  ASEB  continue  to  receive  consulting \nsupport for project implementation; and (ii) the capacity of the new companies be developed in \nmany  areas,  e.g.,  finance,  information  technology,  and  human  resources.  To  address  the \nissues,  a  comprehensive  capacity  development  program  was  developed  comprising  an \n ", "16  \n \n   \ninvestment  loan  component  of  $2,400,000  for  project-specific  support,  and  a  capacity \ndevelopment  TA,  the  Capacity  Development  for  Assam  Power  Sector  Utilities,  for  general \ninstitutional  capacity  development.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,300,000 \nequivalent. ADB will provide the amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000. This will \nbe financed by ADB, on a grant basis, from the ADB\u2019s TA funding program TASF-Others. The \nGovernment will provide the remaining balance equivalent of $300,000. The TA will promote \nvarious  measures  to  strengthen  corporate  governance  and  improve  operating  efficiencies. \nASEB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The scope of the capacity development program \nis listed in Table 6.

INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Justification \n1.  Financial Management \n \n57.  A financial management assessment of ASEB and the implementing agencies assessed \ntheir ability to undertake and fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project components \n(Appendix 12). The assessment was in accordance with ADB guidelines9 using the financial \nmanagement assessment questionnaire and field interviews. Capacity development in a form of \nTA is programmed to address weaknesses identified by the financial management assessment, \nand  will  enhance  the  capacity  of  AEGCL  and  LAEDCL  to  gain  autonomy  of  cash-flow \nmanagement,  treasury,  and  corporate  strategy  functions.  To  further  empower  AEGCL  and \nLAEDCL, various initiatives are under consideration, e.g., adoption of new accounting software, \nasset registration systems, and an update of the Chart of Accounts with Companies Act.

Financial Sustainability: Past Performance and Projections \n \n58.  In the early 1990s, ASEB faced negative net worth, due to increases in T&D losses, \npower shortages, and inadequate quality of power supply. ASEB had a high debt-equity ratio \nimpairing its ability to obtain competitive financing. Realizing the urgency of the situation and \ntaking inspiration from the Electricity Act (2003), GOA formulated the sector reform policy and \nset in place institutional changes, governance improvements, and a robust FRP to enable the \nutilities to achieve a financial turnaround. As the result of the FRP, ASEB reduced financial \nlosses  by  82.5%  from  Rs10.9  billion  in  2005  to  Rs0.9  billion  in  2008.  The  financial \nimprovements are demonstrated by better actual results compared with those forecast in 2003 \nfor the APSDP. The debt to debt-plus-equity ratio declined from 77% in 2005 to 44% in 2008. \nDetailed analysis of sector performance is presented in Appendix 13. \n59.  Guided by the initiatives, AEGCL profitability is expected to grow, moving toward the \nreturn on equity ceiling of 14% allowed under the current regulations. The project funding will \nenable AEGCL to undertake the planned investment. Projected financial performance indicators \nimprove over the forecast period and show adequate debt service coverage throughout the \nMFF. Self-financing capacity improves toward the end of the forecast period. From 2010, the \ndebt service coverage ratio is expected to exceed 1.2 in all years, while the debt to debt-plus-\nequity ratio declines from 31% in 2009 to 17% by 2014 (Table 7).  \nTable 7: Assam Electricity Grid Corporation Limited Financial Projections \nItem  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015 \nTotal Revenue (Rs billion)  3.0   3.9   4.1   5.3   6.2   6.8   7.3  \nAverage Tariff (Rs/MW/day)  8,845  9,815  8,857  9,729  10,020  9,813  9,425 \nNet Profit after Tax (Rs billion)  0.2   0.3   0.5   1.0   1.3   1.4   1.5  \nReturn on Average NFA (%)  17  12  11  10  7  6  5 \nReturn on Average Equity (%)  14  14  14  14  14  14  14 \nDSCR  0.60  1.42   2.21   2.61   2.50   2.76   2.92  \nTotal Assets (Rs billion)  9.6   13.2   22.9   33.8   37.9   43.0  46.0  \nCurrent Ratio, CA/CL  0.79  0.88   1.01   1.26   1.57   1.94   2.34  \nDebt/(Debt plus Equity)   0.65  0.68  0.73  0.67  0.56  0.48  0.40 \nCA = current assets, CL = current liabilities, DSCR = debt service coverage ratio, MW = megawatt., NFA = Net Fixed \nAssets; Rs = rupees. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable 8: Lower Assam Electricity Distribution Company Limited Financial Projections \nItem  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015 \nTotal Revenue (Rs billion)  22.4   26.1   28.7  34.4   43.8   50.5   61.4 \nAvg.

Projections  for  LAEDCL  show  that  profitability  will  be  consistently  sustained  and \nimproved. LAEDCL\u2019s return on equity will be positive from 2009 onward, with return on equity \nreaching 14% by 2011, after which the return is expected to increase as large investments \nmade during the MFF are capitalized and put into operation. The tariff increase for full cost \nrecovery is expected to peak after 2014 due to cost reduction efforts, while a lifeline tariff for the \nfirst 1 kilowatt-hour of consumption per household per day is kept fixed (Table 8).  \n \n3.  Financial Analysis \n61.  A financial evaluation of the transmission projects under tranche 1 was carried out in \n2009 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections were converted into real terms \nby adjusting for the projected effects of domestic inflation. Project revenues are based on the \nmethodology applied by AERC, which is expected to be in line with the recently published 2009 \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission tariff regulations.  \n \n62.  The base case financial internal rate of return for the transmission projects is 7.41%, \ncompared with the weighted average cost of capital of 2.10%, thus indicating financial viability. \nSensitivity analyses showed that the results are robust to a range of project-related sensitivities \ncovering increases in capital cost, operation and maintenance costs, and project implementation \ndelays. A summary of the financial analysis is in Appendix 14.  \n \n4.  Economic Analysis \n63.  Economic analysis was undertaken for the transmission projects to be financed under \ntranche 1 of the MFF. The economic internal rate of return was calculated by comparing the \nwith- and without-project scenarios. Economic benefits accrue to consumers in Assam, the \nelectricity utilities in Assam, and the overall economy.  \n \n64.  The  benefits  from  incremental  consumption  of  power  are  valued  using  consumers\u2019 \nwillingness to pay, while the benefits from the nonincremental consumption of power are valued \nbased on the resource cost saving from displaced generation sources. Initial estimates indicate \nthat the transmission projects under the first tranche have an economic internal rate of return of \n16.80%.  This  shows  the  economic  viability  of  the  transmission  projects.  Robust  economic \nperformance is demonstrated under a range of downside sensitivity analysis. A summary of the \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 15. \n \nB.  Social Aspects \n \n65.       For  tranche  1,  a  short  resettlement  plan  was  prepared,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and the resettlement framework, in full consultation with \nstakeholders and affected people. Additionally, compensation for indigenous people is provided \nin the resettlement plan since its impacts under tranche 1 are not significant. The resettlement \nframework and IPDF were disclosed to the affected people in their local language. Appraisal of \nsuccessive tranches will require a review of the resettlement framework and IPDF, as well as \npreparation  of  resettlement  and  indigenous  people  development  plans,  if  needed,  or  the \nappropriate indigenous people plan and/or actions for all projects with indigenous people issues. \nA summary of the poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16. \n \n66.  Tranche  1  will  have  minimal  impact  on  indigenous  people  as  four  scheduled  tribe \nhouseholds  will  lose  a  small  strip  of  land.  Minimal  land  acquisition  is  required  for  the \ntransmission network expansion under tranche 1. The projects under the MFF will minimize \n ", "20  \n \n   \nresettlement  by  adopting  adequate  engineering  solutions  in  the  design  through  proper \ninvolvement of all stakeholders, and no relocation is anticipated. The substations under the \nprojects  will  be  constructed  both  on  government  and  private  land.  The  construction  of \ntransmission lines will not require any permanent land acquisition. However, a temporary effect \non crops during construction is likely. Civil works will be carried out off-season when possible to \nminimize impact. The augmentation of the substations will not require any land acquisition. Of \nthe six proposed substations, three will be constructed on government land, which is free from \nany use. Two substations are proposed to be constructed on the barren land of the tea garden \nand the remaining one substation will require private land acquisition. However, the amount of \nland required is quite small. Approximately 24.09 ha will be required for the substations, of this \n12.04 ha will be private land and the remaining 12.04 ha will be government land.  \n \n67.  The construction of transmission lines will not require any permanent land acquisition, \nand will only have a temporary effect on crops during construction. Nine households will lose \nland permanently; of these four scheduled tribe households will lose a strip of land, which will \nnot be more than 10% of their productive assets. Adequate measures and entitlement are \naddressed  in  the  resettlement  plan  to  provide  for  their  vulnerability.  None  of  the  affected \nhouseholds are severely affected as they are not losing more than 10% of their productive \nassets. ASEB has ensured sufficient budgetary resources to cover the compensation packages \nprovided in the resettlement plan. It also has ensured that scheduling tower construction and \nstringing minimizes crop disruption and is common practice. Impacts of tranche 1 and future \ntranches, if any, are expected to be minimal. Compensation packages and a short resettlement \nplan were prepared for the project components of tranche 1 (Appendix 17).  \n \n68.  The Investment Program is expected to have positive impacts in terms of health and \neducation conditions, and facilities are expected to improve in Assam. The average family size \nis 5.91. Electrical devices were found to be gender-related as women are generally considered \nto be more involved in household-related activities. In fact, the average number of electric lamps \nper households is 4.14 followed by 3.18 fans, 1.06 televisions, and 0.18 each of washing \nmachines and water pumps. Among the households, those reporting having electricity said they \nused kerosene and/or diesel, wood, and gas as alternate energy along with electricity.  \n \n69.  The  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  benefit  all  grid-connected  consumers  with \nadequate and reliable supply of electricity, to support the Government\u2019s projections for growth in \nenergy demand and its intent to make affordable grid-based electricity supply available to the \nentire population by 2012. Government policy includes support to poor households via a lifeline \ntariff  for  the  first  1  kilowatt-hour  of  consumption  per  household  per  day.  A  secure  and \npredictable electricity supply will enable social and economic benefits to materialize, as well as \nensure improved conditions for schools, hospitals, and other social services. Improvements in \nquality and reliability of supply that will accrue from targeted investments are expected to \nimprove living conditions in rural areas through the creation of job and income opportunities.  \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects \n \n70.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  was  prepared  for  the \nInvestment Program, outlining the policy, procedures, and institutional requirements for the \noverall and for each tranche. ASEB is responsible for preparing the required environmental \nassessments  and  obtaining  ADB  concurrence  before  implementation.  Environmental \nassessment of the proposed investments has been and will continue to be conducted following \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy, the EARF, and applicable Government laws and regulations. The \n ", "21 \n \nfirst tranche investments are classified as category B10 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy. ASEB has prepared the IEE for tranche 1. Environmental assessments will be prepared \nin due course for the remaining projects as applicable, in accordance with the EARF. The \nsummary IEE for tranche 1 outlines environmental benefits and negative impacts, proposed \nmitigation measures, and the EMP. Public consultations indicate strong local support for the \nproposed investments. \n \n71.  For tranche 1, based on the environmental assessments and reconnaissance surveys, \nmost  of  the  impacts  will  occur  during  construction.  The  principal  impacts  are  related  to \nacquisition of rights-of-way for transmission lines, earthmoving and initial clearing of vegetation \nfor construction, and periodic clearing of vegetation during operations. These impacts will be \nmitigated  by  selective  routing  of  transmission  lines,  appropriate  erosion-control  measures, \nproper  management  of  construction-related  wastes,  and  provision  of  compensation  for \nreforestation, as necessary. No endangered, rare, or threatened species of flora or fauna have \nbeen  reported  at  any  project  sites.  Adequate  provisions  are  made  for  the  environmental \nmitigation and monitoring requirements and their associated costs. The project sites are mostly \non  government-owned  land.  The  land  acquired  for  new  substations  is  mostly  uninhabited, \nunused,  and  outside  towns  and  villages.  Mitigation  measures  related  to  construction  and \nspecified in the EMP will be incorporated into civil works contracts. Although the contractors will \nhave primary responsibility for implementation of mitigation measures during construction, the \nrelevant implementing agency will be responsible for overall implementation of site-specific \nEMPs. \n \nD.  Benefits and Beneficiaries \n72.  Overall the Investment Program will contribute to economic development of the state of \nAssam on several fronts. The first group of beneficiaries will be local electricity consumers, \nincluding about 1 million electrified households; small- and medium-sized businesses, e.g., silk \nfactories; hospitals; and schools. As the second group of beneficiaries, all the existing electric \nconsumers including domestic users (51%), commercial users (10%), industrial users (27%),  \nagricultural users (2%), and others (10% will benefit from enhanced power operations. Through \nthe  distribution  franchisee  component,  720  entrepreneurs  are  expected  to  expand  their \noperations with at least 1,500 employees.  \n73.  In  addition,  construction  of  infrastructure  and  installation  of  information  and \ncommunication technologies are expected to create at least 500 jobs. The renewable energy \ndevelopment component will provide benefits for 2,100 villages with off-grid renewable energy in \nthe long term. With 89% of Assam\u2019s population living in rural areas, and approximately 60% of \nhouseholds living below the poverty line, the rural electrification component will have a direct \nbenefit for the poor.11 The Investment Program will rationalize tariffs as well as improve the state \npower sector\u2019s financial viability.  \n \n \n                                                 \n10 Each tranche will be subject to environmental categorization. All tranches are expected to be category B or C. \nTranches will be categorized as necessary if category A- or B-sensitive projects and/or projects are identified. \n11  Assam ranks 26th in the human resource development index and 21st in the poverty index in India according to the \nHuman Development Report 2001. According to the Census 2001, 52.65% of the total workforce in the state is \nengaged in agriculture and related activities. Assam has levels and rates of growth of income below the average \nfor the country. The incidence of unemployment, measured as a percentage of the labor force is increasing in \nAssam. The unemployment rate in Assam in 1983 was 2.2%; it rose to 4.6% by 1999/00. \n ", "22  \n \n   \nE.  Potential Risks \n \n74.  The key broad assumptions are (i) macroeconomic growth will remain stable; (ii) GOA \nwill  remain  committed  to  further  power  sector  reforms  and  institutional  improvement;  and  \n(iii)  GOA  will  execute  its  investment  plan,  successfully  combining  physical  infrastructure \ninvestments with nonphysical investments in capacity development to maintain a sustainable \npower sector. Broad risks include a slowdown in the depth and pace of policy and sector \nreforms. \n \n75.  These risks can be mitigated through political commitment, concerted action, and sound \nsupervision. GOA is fully committed to expanding its power supply and continuing with sector \nreforms, including further tariff reform, improved corporate governance, institutional change, and \nincreased private sector participation. The state is closely following the execution of the long- \nand medium-term plans for the sector, and recognizes that capacity development is a major part \nof the process. The proposed interventions will help address these issues at two separate \nlevels\u2014state and project. The themes covered are broad (planning and policy formulation) and \nspecific  (due  diligence,  project  preparation,  implementation,  evaluation,  monitoring,  and \nreporting for results). Good governance and fiduciary controls are recognized as important, \nalong with measures to ensure transparency and efficiency.  \n \n76.  Specific project-related assumptions are (i) proper operation and maintenance of the \ninstallations will be carried out according to standard requirements, (ii) adequate competent staff \nare available in the companies, (iii) load growth is as projected, (iv) regulatory mechanisms and \ninterventions  are  consistent,  and  (v)  the  capacity  development  program  is  successfully \nimplemented. Specific project-related risks include, (i) limited capacity and coordination of ASEB \nand implementing agencies to implement projects, and (ii) limited capacity of power generation \nplants not financed by ADB, that are not commissioned in a timely manner. These risks can be \nmitigated  through  the  capacity  development  TA  and  close-coordination  with  developers  of \nassociated facilities. Overall, the integrated benefits and impact are expected to outweigh the \ncosts, given the likelihood of the risks occurring. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n77.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, GOA, and ASEB have given \nthe following assurances, which are largely incorporated in the FFA, and will be incorporated in \nthe individual loan agreement(s) and project agreement(s) as applicable and mutually agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB for each project under the MFF. \n \n78.  Institutional and Financial Matters. ASEB will carry out the TA in a timely manner. In \nthis regard, ASEB will ensure full participation of APGCL, AEGCL, and LAEDCL.  \n79.  ASEB, in consultation with APGCL, AEGCL, and LAEDCL, will develop a new business \nprocess to support APGCL, AEGCL, and LAEDCL to strengthen the functions of corporate, \nhuman resources, and financial management in consultation with relevant stakeholders so that \nthe functions will be fully delegated to APGCL, AEGCL, and LAEDCL within 5 years of the \ninception of the TA.  \n80.  ASEB will, through LAEDCL, ensure implementation of the plan to be developed under \nthe TA for expanding the SPPS program in the state, so as to at least double the number of \nconsumers under the franchisees from the current level (of May 2009) by December 2014.    \n \n ", "23 \n \n81.  ASEB will ensure that information pertinent to the projects under the MFF would be \nmade available to the public and relevant stakeholders.  \n \n82.  ASEB will ensure that the projects under the MFF are implemented by the implementing \nagencies in accordance with governance measures referred under the section on Corporate \nGovernance Measures in the FFA.  \n \n83.  ASEB shall ensure that during preparatory work for subsequent PFRs under the MFF, \nstakeholder participation and public consultation shall be continued by relevant implementing \nagencies as initiated in the processing of tranche 1. \n \n84.  ASEB will ensure that the implementing agencies will, by no later than December 2011, \nfile for a multiyear tariff with AERC with all relevant information to enable the issuance of a \nmultiyear tariff order by AERC in a timely manner.  \n \n85.  ASEB will ensure that the implementing agencies maintain a debt service coverage ratio \nof 1.2 on and after 31 March 2011. \n \n86.  Counterpart  Funding.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  GOA  and  ASEB  make \navailable, in a timely manner, the counterpart funding for the efficient implementation of each \nproject.  \n \n87.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. GOA will cause ASEB, and through ASEB the \nimplementing  agencies,  to  undertake  the  projects  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995),  the  resettlement  framework,  and  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of the Government and GOA.  \n \n88.  Subject  to  compliance  with  the  relevant  provision  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  in \naccordance with all applicable laws and regulations of the Government and GOA, ASEB will \ncause the implementing agencies to acquire or make available the land and rights to land free \nfrom any encumbrances, and clear the utilities, trees, and any other obstruction from such land, \nrequired for commencement of construction activities in accordance with the schedule agreed \nunder the related civil works contract.  \n \n89.  ASEB will cause the implementing agencies to ensure that all land and rights-of-way \nrequired by the projects will be made available in a timely manner and that the provisions of the \nresettlement  plans,  including  compensation  and  entitlements  for  affected  households  and \npersons, will be implemented in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations of the \nGovernment, GOA, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and the agreed resettlement plan.  \n \n90.  ASEB will cause the implementing agencies to ensure that affected people, if any, under \neach project are provided compensation in a timely manner in accordance with the related \nresettlement plans, and applicable laws and regulations of the Government and GOA. GOA \nthrough ASEB will provide adequate budgetary support to cover the costs of land acquisition \nand resettlement. ASEB with assistance of the implementing agencies will submit progress and \ncompletion reports on land acquisition and resettlement under the quarterly progress reports for \neach  project.  In  addition,  the  external  monitoring  report  shall  be  submitted  to  ADB  on  a \nsemiannual basis for review with regard to land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n91.  ASEB will cause the implementing agencies to ensure that prior to land acquisition and \nany resettlement under each project, the related resettlement plan including its update based on \n ", "24  \n \n   \nconsensus of affected people, is disclosed with all necessary information made available to \npeople affected by the project and confirm that it is uploaded onto ADB\u2019s web site. ASEB will \nensure that essential communal property that may be affected under land acquisition and \nresettlement  is  replaced  as  appropriate  in  an  expeditious  manner  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement plans.  \n \n92.  Compensation should be awarded in case construction activities block pathways and \ndeprive  some  people  of  their  livelihood  temporarily.  Further,  ASEB  would  ensure  that  all \ncompensation  programs  are  completed  as  outlined  in  resettlement  plans  prior  to  the \ncommencement of civil works.  \n \n93.  ASEB  will  cause  the  implementing  agencies  to  implement  construction  contracts \ncontaining binding requirements for construction contractors to fully reinstate pathways, other \nlocal infrastructures, and agricultural land to at least their preproject condition upon construction \ncompletion.  Provision  should  be  made  for  adequate  recording  of  the  condition  of  roads, \nagricultural  land,  and  other  infrastructure  prior  to  transport  of  material  and  construction \ncommencement. ASEB will cause the implementing agencies to ensure that the requirements \nset out in the IPDF will be implemented as required. In case any indigenous people are affected \nby the project, an appropriate indigenous people development plan will be formulated and \nimplemented in accordance with the IPDF.  \n \n94.  Environment. GOA, through ASEB, will ensure that the projects under the MFF are \nundertaken and that all project facilities are designed, implemented, operated, and maintained \nin accordance with all applicable laws and regulations of the Government and GOA, ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy, and the EARF. For each project, ASEB will cause the implementing agency \nto prepare and implement the necessary IEE or EIA, and EMP (with budget) in accordance with \nthe EARF. For projects, the environmental categorization and assessment procedures defined \nin the EARF will be followed.  \n \n95.  For  any  environment  category  A  or  B  sensitive  projects,  an  SEIA  or  SIEE  will  be \nprepared and made available to the public 120 days before a PFR is submitted to ADB for \napproval. Through the implementing agencies, ASEB will monitor, audit, and report to ADB \ntwice  a  year  on  implementation  of  the  EMPs  for  each  project.  GOA  will  ensure  that  all \nassociated projects will be constructed and commissioned in compliance with the laws and \nregulations of the Government.  \n \n96.  Social. ASEB will cause the IA to ensure that civil works contracts under the Project \nfollow all applicable labor laws of the Borrower and the State and that these further include \nprovisions to the effect that contractors (i) carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs for labor \nand  disseminate  information  at  worksites  on  risks  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and \nHIV/AIDS as part of health and safety measures for those employed during construction; and (ii) \nfollow and implement all statutory provisions on labor (including not employing or using children \nas labor, equal pay for equal work), health, safety, welfare, sanitation, and working conditions. \nSuch contracts shall also include clauses for termination in case of any breach of the stated \nprovisions by the contractors.  \n \n97.  Subproject  Selection  and  Implementation.  ASEB  will  cause  the  implementing \nagencies  under  each  project  to  ensure  that  all  subprojects  are  evaluated,  selected,  and \nprepared in accordance with the selection criteria and approval process included as schedule 4 \nto the FFA and implemented in accordance with the procedures set out therein. \n \n ", "25 \n \nVII.

Assam Power Sector Reform  \n  1.  Reorganization of Assam State Electricity Board \n \n1.  Unbundling  of  Assam  State  Electricity  Board.  To  encourage  efficiency,  improve \nservice  quality,  and  increase  management  accountability,  the  state  government  of  Assam \n(GOA) unbundled the Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB) into five companies: Assam Power \nGeneration Corporation Limited (APGCL); Assam Electricity Grid Corporation Limited (AEGCL); \nand  three  distribution  companies:  Central  Assam  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited \n(CAEDCL),  Lower  Assam  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited  (LAEDCL),  and  Upper \nAssam  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited  (UAEDCL).  ASEB  remains  active  as  the \ncoordinating agency. The statutory transfer scheme was approved on 10 December 2004.  \n \n2.  Transfer of Assets, Liabilities, and Personnel. Within a 6-month provisional period \nending  on  31  May  2005,  GOA  completed  the  transfer  of  assets,  liabilities,  and  personnel \n(provisionally assigned on as-is where-is basis with subsequent representation mediated by a \nGOA committee), and business arrangements to the successor companies so they could be \nindependent and operating fully.  \n \n3.  Governance  and  Industry  Structure.  ASEB  and  its  successor  companies  filed \nintercompany contracts with Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission (AERC), including power \npurchase  agreements,  transmission  service  agreements,  and  bulk  supply  agreements  with \nASEB retaining the bulk purchaser function during the transition period. Independent managing \ndirectors and a board of directors are responsible for the operation of each company. \n \n  2.  Regulatory Framework and Tariff Reforms \n \n4.  Capacity Building and Staffing of AERC. In February 2005, GOA decided to expand \nAERC from a one-member commission to a multimember commission with a chairperson and \ntwo  members.  The  commission  structure  has  been  retained  along  with  secretarial  and \nadministrative staff. \n \n5.  Regulatory Rules and Standards. In accordance with the Electricity Act (2003), AERC \nand  GOA  have  progressively  framed  a  number  of  codes,  rules,  and  standards  governing  \ntariff-setting, licensing, long-term sector planning, a nondiscretionary business environment, and \nadjudication of disputes. Principal Regulations were notified by May 2005, with progressive \namendments issued consistent with national policies and guidelines and Appellate Tribunal \nOrder. \n \n6.  Tariff Rationalization. AERC has been rationalizing the tariffs since the first tariff order \nin April 2003. For the three subsequent tariff orders for the utilities since FY2006 onward, AERC \nadopted a performance-based regulation with return on equity linked to utility performance  \n(7% for LAEDCL, 14% for AEGCL in 2008). The cost coverage (ratio of tariff to cost) at LAEDCL \nlevel as per AERC tariff order 2007/08 is expected to reach 88% from own consumers. On the \nissue of multiyear tariffs and a 3-year control period starting 2007, AERC after considering the \nunavailability  of  reliable  utility  data,  restructuring  impacts,  and  utility  preparedness  for  a \nmultiyear tariff adopted a cautious approach of examining and approving costs on a single-year \nbasis. \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nB.  Physical Power Sector Overview \n7.  Generation. Assam experienced increased peak power shortages over the entire 10th \nfive year Plan period (1% at end of the 9th Plan to 8.4% in 2007/08). This has had a severe \nimpact since demand in Assam has increased at a consistent pace from 688 megawatts (MW) \nin FY2002 to 848 MW in FY2008, Generation from APGCL accounted for 45% of Assam\u2019s total \npower availability of 1,960 gigawatt-hours in the first half of 2008. Only 766 MW were available \nto respond to the peak power demand of 848 MW in 2008. This is expected to be addressed \nwith adequate generation capacity being developed for Assam.  \n8.  Transmission. Since 2002, AEGCL has been expanding capacity and currently has 38 \nsubstations and 4,189 circuit-kilometers of transmission lines (voltage ranging from 66 kV to  \n220 kV). In FY2008, the transmission network was able to meet a maximum demand of 766 MW \n(90% of the maximum demand) of Assam and transmitted 4,079 gigawatt hours (92% of energy \nrequirement).  The  transmission  capacity  is  inadequate  to  serve  peak  demand,  which  is \nexpected to grow at an annual rate of 14.8% to reach 1,883 MW in 2014 as per the 17th Electric \nPower Survey of the CEA.  \n9.  Distribution.  The  Assam  distribution  sector  intends  to  meet  the  national  target  of \nelectrification for all by 2012 as well as 100% household electrification by 2012. Despite some \nimprovement during the Assam Power Sector Development Program, significant improvements \nare needed for (i) reducing losses in excess of 30% (preferably to 15%, as envisaged in the the \nGovernment policy directive), (ii) increasing inadequate transformation capacity at 11 kV, (iii) \nimproving consumer metering, and (iv) enhancing billing efficiencies. Village electrification was \nonly 77% in 2008. New investments need to be targeted to improve the quality of supply and \nreduce  long  low  voltage  circuits  and  distribution  transformer  overloading  through  (i) \ntransformation capacity;  (ii) sub transmission network capacity (33 kV and 11 kV) addition; (iii) \nintroduction of high voltage distribution system and advanced technology-based transformers, \ne.g., amorphous core transformers in the distribution network; (iv) introduction of smaller-rating \ntransformers at intermittent places in long-lines; and (v) introduction of aerial bunched cables in \ntheft-prone  areas.\n \n ", "          Appendix 3      37\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SECTOR \n  India\u2019s power sector has received a major portion of its external assistance from the \nAsian  Development  Bank,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom, Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nKreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  of  Germany,  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  and  World  Bank.

The single point power supply (SPPS) program in Assam is an input-based franchisee \nmodel concept where the distribution licensee, Lower Assam Electricity Distribution Company \nLimited (LAEDCL) is responsible for providing power at a bulk supply point and the franchisee is \nresponsible for the billing and collection from consumers. The community-based private sector \nand nongovernment organizations selected through competitive bidding process buy electricity \nfrom LAEDCL. The franchisee retains a pre-set margin and passes on the remaining collection \nto LAEDCL. With 720 franchisees, the SPPS program has enhanced power sector governance \nwith more participation, competition, and transparency; and improved sector financial viability. \nUnder the 2003 Assam Power Sector Development Program, power supply in Sualkuchi was \nexpanded in a reliable manner by the SPPS program, enabling more electrification of village \nhouseholds  and  increased  consumption.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  studied  the \nimpact on small silk factories, a hospital, and a school through a series of field visits and \ninterviews with village residents. This appendix summarizes the outcome of a field case study \nby  ADB  conducted  from  January  to  March  2009  to  assess  the  example  of  direct  linkage \nbetween reliable electricity supply and poverty reduction.  \n \n2.  Power for Silk Factories. ADB visited one of the oldest small silk Sualkuchi factories\u2014\nBraza Silk Factory\u2014in Sualkuchi village, where approximately 40 women employees work. \nWhile talking to the female workers and management, the SPPS scheme was noted to be a \ncrucial role element in for the overall development and progress of the factory. People are of the \nopinion that, prior to the SPPS scheme, the supply of electricity was not adequate. Female \nworkers were limited to 6 hours of work because of the limited electricity supply. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn electrified machine replaced the old manual machine (on the left) causing better supply of threads, while \n  women enjoy better working hours and working conditions after introduction of the single point power supply \n  scheme in Sualkochi Village \n \n \n3.  Ms. Haritri Boro and Ms. Champa Boro, employees of the factory, told the ADB mission \nthat the improved electricity supply since the takeover of the franchisee in managing distribution \nhas created a significant change in their working conditions because of adequate lighting to \nensure sufficient working hours. They also note that increased working hours due to stable \nelectricity supply enables them to make more sophisticated sarees with advanced modern \ndesign and greater market value. They said that in earlier days, they used to prepare only one \nsaree with a simple design in a week. With the improved electricity supply they are able to make \n ", "42  Appendix 6 \n \n \none saree in less than a week with more design and handicrafts, resulting in greater market \nvalue. They said that they are now able to make one saree per week and earn Rs500 per saree \nresulting in a monthly income of Rs2,000.  \n \n4.  Mr. Pulin Bharali, the factory owner, notes that the village SPPS scheme has been quite \nhelpful in increasing employment: the number of female workers increased from 20 in 2003 to \n40 in 2009. Power cuts are now very limited\u2014about 1 hour per day, compared with 5 hours per \nday in the past. Thus production has increased with better designed clothes. This has opened \nbetter markets for their products. In general, everyone in the factory is very satisfied with the \nSPPS power supply. \n \n5.  Power for Education. In Sualkuchi, improvements in electricity supply have encouraged \ninvestment in educational facilities. With a reliable and stable power supply, the elementary \nschool for girls and boys now uses computers and internet access in the classroom. At home, \nas a consequence of better voltage profiles, hours available for educational activities for adults \nand  children  have  increased.  The  ADB  mission  visited  Sualkuchi  CBSE  public  school  in \nFebruary 2009. The school was established when the SPPS started in 2003.  \n \n6.  Mr. Krishna Kumar, the school principal, notes that although the school was electrified \nfrom the beginning, the power supply was irregular. According to him, the SPPS program \nhelped them access a more reliable electricity supply, which has a direct positive bearing on the \nschool and its daily activities. Sualkuchi\u2019s humid summer climate creates difficulties for students \nwhen the electricity supply is irregular. With a better electricity supply, the school uses more \ncomputers, which ultimately encourages students to know more and concentrate on studies with \naccess to modern electronic equipment. This ultimately reduces the number of dropouts. The \nworking environment is better now with adequate lighting and fans due to reliable electricity \nsupply\u2014a result of the SPPS scheme. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBetter electricity supply by the single point power supply scheme helps the school introduce more computers \n \nand students enjoy the better school facilities. \n \n \n7.  Power for Health Care. The case study verified that the enhanced electricity supply has \nimproved quality and availability of public health and other social services. One hospital in \nSualkuchi village, Mahatma Gandhi rural hospital, illustrates how better electricity supply plays a \nvital role in the overall development of treatment and patient conditions. The ADB mission \nvisited the hospital and conducted interviews with the hospital official, Dr. Kartik Chandra Medhi, \nand with patients. The mission learned that the current franchisee-run SPPS program helped \nthe hospital introduce more modern equipment such as, an x-ray machine, vaccine storage, \n ", "  Appendix 6   43\nlaparoscopic machine, and ultrasound machine; and place more fans and lights in the patient \nareas, among other advances.  \n \n8.  The hospital authority notes that the hospital had only 5 beds before 2005 and now has \napproximately 30. The number of doctors increased from 3 in 2005 to 10 in 2009. The unreliable \npower supply caused various problems for patients, and complaints of electricity failure had to \nbe acknowledged and rectified on a regular basis. The current stable electricity supply allows \nstaff to safely maintain vaccines in the freezer. If not directly, the SPPS scheme has a positive \nimpact on patients. In 2009, 400 patients visit the hospital per day compared with 100 patients \nin 2005 . Patients note that the hospital has better facilities, lighting, and sanitation facilities with \nthe regular power supply. The franchisee staff gives utmost attention to any complaints by the \nhospital, and the hospital as a result provides better services to patients. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe hospital has modern medical equipment that operates smoothly with better electricity supply. Patients \n \nhave better conditions. \n \n ", "4   4        Appendix 7 \n  \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES FOR TRANCHE 1 PROJECTS \n \nTable A7.1: Detailed Cost Estimate by Expenditure Category \n \nRs Million $ Million\nForeign Local Total Foreign Local Total % of Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost Exchange Currency Cost Base Cost\nA.

A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  Executing  Agency,  the  Assam  State \nElectricity  Board  (ASEB)  and  implementing  agencies:  Assam  Electricity  Grid  Corporation \nLimited (AEGCL) and Lower Assam Electricity Distribution Company Limited was undertaken to \nassess their ability to undertake and fulfill fiduciary requirements for the project components of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). The assessment was in accordance with ADB guidelines \nusing the financial management assessment questionnaire and field interviews, and was  in \naccordance with the guidelines of ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.  \n \n2.  Prior to 2003, ASEB was responsible for carrying out all the financial management-\nrelated functions for the unbundled entity. ASEB prepared its accounts as per the old Electricity \n(Supply) Annual Accounts Rules (1985). Specific financial management-related gaps in training, \nprocesses, and systems resulted in deficiencies in the cash management function at ASEB. \nThis,  in  some  part,  resulted  in  repeated  defaults  on  payment  to  suppliers  and  over  time \ncontributed to a worsening of the financial situation in ASEB as cross-subsidizing consumers, \ne.g., tea gardens and industries, moved out of the distribution network because of unreliable \npower  supply.  This  eventually  resulted  in  reduced  cost  coverage  for  ASEB,  coupled  with \nunsustainable debt and negative net worth. \n \n3.  Under  the  ADB-supported  Assam  Power  Sector  Development  Program  (APSDP), \ncommencing in 2003, structural reforms were initiated to improve the operating and financial \nperformance of ASEB. The state government of Assam (GOA) unbundled ASEB into Assam \nPower Generation Corporation Limited (APGCL); AEGCL; and three distribution companies in \nthe lower, central, and upper areas of Assam. ASEB remains active as the coordinating agency.  \n \n4.  GOA also implemented a financial restructuring plan (FRP) for debt restructuring and \nprovided transitional support to enable the newly formed utilities to commence operations with a \nclean balance sheet without the burden of past ASEB liabilities. Each of the newly formed \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution companies is required to comply with the accounting \nand reporting standards prescribed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the \nCompanies Act (1956).  \n \n5.  The APSDP resulted in several accomplishments in the area of financial management. \nThe newly formed companies have introduced accounting policies as per statutory reporting \nrequirements and conducted statutory audits of their financial statements as per Institute of \nChartered Accountants of India guidelines, using independent auditors. No major accountability \nissues  were  identified  in  the  independent  audit  report  for  2005\u20132007.  Audited  financial \nstatements for 2007/08 are expected to be released shortly. As required under the APSDP loan \ncovenant,  audited  project  accounts  and  audited  financial  statements  of  ASEB  have  been \nregularly submitted, though with some delays.  \n \n6.  Despite noticeable improvements, certain constraints have been identified with respect \nto carrying out the financial management function. These constraints need to be addressed \nunder the sector road map and policy dialogue for the proposed multitranche financing facility. \nThe newly formed generation, transmission, and distribution companies continue to be partially \nautonomous with regard to financial management and operate under a centralized cash flow \nmechanism where all revenue collections from distribution utilities are routed to ASEB and cash \nrequirements to meet expenses in each company are drawn from ASEB on a need basis.  \n \n ", "Appendix 12     53 \n \n7.  Financial management functions such as investment, funding, and budgeting decision \nmaking are being carried out in consultation with ASEB. Also, a paucity of well-trained staff in \nthe area of financial management has resulted in existing staff having to take on additional \nresponsibilities  for  the  financial  management  function  in  multiple  companies.  This  has \ncontributed to delays in finalizing accounts at regional offices. Further, constraints with the \nlegacy information technology systems have resulted in data verification problems and timely \nconsolidation of accounts at the head office of the implementing agencies. A study of the \nfinancial statements and discussions with the financial management staff indicate the need for \nprocess improvement in the budgetary control function, for cost center accounting, and for \nupdating existing accounting policy manuals.  \n  \n8.  The sector road map discussions indicate that GOA would support the development of \nthe financial management function in AEGCL and the Lower Assam Electricity Distribution \nCompany Limited through the introduction of information technology systems for the financial \nmanagement function that could be implemented rapidly in a cost-effective manner. To support \nthis,  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  provided  for  (i)  staff  capacity  development,  \n(ii) consulting services to assess and identify areas for process improvement in the financial \nmanagement function, and (iii) assistance in carrying out updates on accounting policy and \nmanuals for the executing and implementing agencies. The proposed changes in the sector \nstructure coupled with capacity development in the sector entities is expected to empower the \ndistribution companies and result in complete unbundling of ASEB by 2014.  \n \n9.  The  assessment  of  the  financial  management  function  for  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies indicate ability to undertake the fiduciary requirements for the loan. \nASEB has a well-staffed project management unit (one director and 8 full-time officers) with \nprior  experience  executing  an  ADB  loan1,  and  is  conversant  with  ADB  guidelines  and \nprocedures. AEGCL, the Implementing Agency for tranche 1 has established a separate project \ncell to monitor implementation of the ADB loan-related transmission investments in an effective \nmanner.  \n10.  The  financial  management  TA  requirements  identified  during  loan  fact  finding  are \nconsidered appropriate to provide support for adequate financial management, reporting, and \nimplementation of the multitranche financing facility. As a consequence of the TA support, the \nproposed project financial management arrangements are considered satisfactory.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Prior to 2003, the Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB) was a vertically integrated \nmonopoly that was plagued with a high-cost structure and an unfavorable sales mix. Sub-\noptimal billing and collection, and unsustainable technical and commercial losses (44% in 2002) \nled to repeated defaults on payments, large burden of accumulated debts, and inadequate \nfunds for operation and maintenance, reflected in heavy load-shedding and migration of cross-\nsubsidizing customers to captive generation.  \n2.  The financial restructuring plan approved by the state government of Assam under the \nAssam  Power  Sector  Development  Program  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \ninvolved a total restructuring adjustment of Rs45.6 billion comprising a noncash settlement of \nRs34.0 billion and Rs11.58 billion as liabilities involving cash settlement. The debt to equity \nposition of the utility improved from being overlevered at 227% in 2004 to 37% in 2006. The \nAssam government also provided support in terms of contribution to meeting ASEB pension \nliability to the extent of Rs0.89 billion in 2006.  \n3.  ASEB improved its cost recovery from 49% in 2002 to 85% in 2007. The 2007 target in \nthe Assam Power Sector Development Program was exceeded through the reduction of debt \nburden through the financial restructuring plan (debt to debt-plus-equity ratio declined from 77% \nin 2005 to 44% in 2008) and several other factors such as improvements in generation, a 42.5% \n(2003) to 35% (2009) transmission and distribution (T&D) loss reduction, and trading income \ngeneration The tariff rationalization process by the Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission \nfrom 2003 to 2008 contributed to an improvement in the cost coverage.  \n4.  Table A13.1 summarizes ASEB financial performance (2005\u20132008) and indicates the \nuncontrollable  nature  of  elements  such  as  increase  in  gas  prices,  central  power  sector \nundertakings, plant tariffs, and employee expenses due to a central pay commission increase \nleading to a cost increase in 2008. \nTable A13.1: Past Performance of Assam State Electricity Board \nItem   FY 2005  FY 2006  FY 2007  FY 2008 \nASEB Performance   Actual  Actual  Actual  Unaudited \nGeneration and Purchases (GWh)  3,302  3,360  3,396  3,641 \nLosses (%)  39  35  33  31 \nSales MU  2,016  2,184  2,275  2,512 \nAverage Revenue (Rs/kWh)  3.78  4.24  4.48  4.66 \nIncome (Rs billion)  10  11  12  16 \nExpenditure (Rs billion)  21  13  13  17 \nActual Profit after Tax (Rs billion)  (11)  (2)  (1)  (1) \nReturn on Average NFA (%)  (207)  (33)  (14)  (13) \n( ) = negative number, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour, MU =  Million Units  , NFA = net fixed assets. \nSources: Annual accounts, Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5.  Though Assam has improved since 2003, the financial position of the sector is still not \nvery strong. A benchmark of Assam\u2019s standing vis-\u00e0-vis other Indian states clearly indicates \nthree main issues: (i) Assam\u2019s power purchase cost (Rs4.97\u20135.53/unit) is significantly higher \nthan other utilities like Haryana, Uttaranchal, and West Bengal; (ii) a low proportion of sales to \nindustrial  consumers  and  a  high  proportion  of  captive  generation  (captive  consumption/ \nindustrial sales at 1.47 vis-\u00e0-vis 0.18\u20130.57 for other states); and (iii) a higher operation and \nmaintenance  benchmark  [Assam  (Rs1.26\u2013Rs1.36/unit)  compared  to  other  utilities  (Rs0.36\u2013\nRs0.41/unit)]. \n ", "Appendix 13     55 \n \nB.  Financial Projections  \n \n6.  The financial projections for the sector and the implementing agencies in Assam are \nexpected to be driven by (i) significant generation capacity addition in APGCL, central power \nsector undertakings, projects, and T&D investments enabling the sector to meet unrestricted \ndemand and create a trading surplus, and repatriation from captive power plants; (ii) proposed \nsector reorganization ensuring improved scheduling and better power procurement efficiencies; \nand (iii) leveraging the restructured Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme \nin Assam to drive the proposed reduction in T&D losses by 2014 through information technology \ninterventions.  \n7.  The financial projections for the sector (Table A13.2) indicate that the sector is likely to \nachieve a full turnaround within 2011 assisted by a robust T&D loss reduction program. \nTable A13.2: Sector Financial Projections  \nItem  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015 \nRevenue (Rs billion)  23.2  27.0  30.1  36.5  46.4  53.3  64.6 \nExpenditure (Rs billion)  18.9  21.2  24.6  28.0  34.9  39.4  48.2 \nProfit after tax (Rs billion)  4.2   5.7   5.0  7.8  10.5  12.7  14.9 \nReturn  on  average  equity \n(%)  18  15  9  10  11  12  12 \nBalance Sheet               \nAssets (Rs billion)  62.8  86.8  107.2  130.0  146.9  165.4  182.7 \nCurrent Liability (Rs billion)  19.5  20.2  20.6  21.0  21.4  21.8  22.1 \nLong-term  liability  (Rs \nbillion)  13.2  19.7  22.5  24.3  24.3  24.0  22.9 \nEquity (Rs billion)  30.0  46.8  64.2  84.7  101.3  119.7  137.7 \nDebt/Debt plus Equity (%)  31  30  26  22  19  17  14 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8.

The  project  funding  will  enable  AEGCL  to  undertake  the  planned \ninvestment. Projected financial performance indicators improve over the forecast period. From \n2010 on, the debt service coverage ratio is expected to exceed 1.2 in all years, while the debt to \ndebt-plus-equity ratio is expected to decline to 40 % by 2015. The summary of AEGCL financial \nprojections is in Table 6 of the main text. \n \n9.  Lower Assam Electricity Distribution Company Limited. The financial projections of \nthe Lower Assam Electricity Distribution Company Limited (LAEDCL) indicate that with the \nprogressive  tariff  increases  approved  by  the  Assam  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission, \nprofitability will be sustained and improved on a consistent basis. LAEDCL\u2019s return on equity will \nbe positive from 2009 onward, achieving 14% from 2011 onward. The returns will improve over \nthe subsequent period driven by the focused T&D loss reduction program and trading revenues. \nWith the proposed tariffs, expected cash flow is strong and the debt service ratio is expected to \nexceed 1.2 in all years.

The  financial  analysis  of  the  proposed  transmission  projects  was  carried  out  in \naccordance with Financial Management and Analysis of Projects of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB).1 All financial costs and benefits are expressed in constant 2009 prices. Cost \nstreams used for financial internal rate of return (FIRR) determination, i.e., capital investment \nand operation and maintenance, reflect the costs of delivering the estimated benefits. The \ncurrent methodology to calculate tariffs for transmission wheeling charge was used to estimate \nthe financial benefits.  \n \nA.  Methodology and Major Assumptions \n \n2.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of Assam Electricity Grid Corporation \nLimited (AEGCL) was calculated for the proposed transmission projects was compared with the \nproject FIRRs to ascertain the financial viability of the projects. The sensitivity of the FIRR to \nadverse movements in the underlying assumptions was also assessed. Based on this analysis, \nthe transmission projects are assessed to be financially viable.  \n \n3.  Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of the \nwith- and without-investment scenarios. Incremental costs include the investment and operation \ncosts  associated  with  transmission  projects.  The  investment  costs  include  all  civil  works, \nelectrical and mechanical works, and resettlement costs associated with all the substations and \ntransmissions project. The incremental benefits to the project company would arise from the \nrevenue that would be approved by the Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission (AERC) \nbased  on  its  tariff  determination  principles.  The  projects  are  assumed  to  have  a  25-year \neconomic life and residual value of 10% of the original investment at the end of the 25-year \nevaluation period. \n \n4.  The tariff principles set by AERC in March 2006 allow AEGCL to pass through full cost \nrecovery of depreciation, return on equity, operation and maintenance expenses, and interest \non loans and working capital. AERC tariff methodology for transmission follows the Central \nElectricity Regulatory Commission tariff methodology for interstate transmission licensees such \nas  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited.  Recent  revisions  in  Central  Electricity  Rural \nCommission tariff methodology for 2009\u20132014 that would need to be considered for adoption by \nAERC for transmission tariffs such as depreciation norms and interest on working capital norms \nhave been factored into the FIRR calculations.2 The above tariff revenue streams are converted \nto real terms by adjusting for domestic inflation. Transmission projects considered are also \nexpected  to  produce  positive  environmental  benefits  mainly  on  account  of  delivery  of \npredominantly clean energy to Assam.  \n \nB.  Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n \n5.  To  compute  the  WACC,  the  financing  sources  are  assumed  to  comprise  state \ngovernment of Assam (GOA) equity contributions and foreign loans. The cost of equity is \ncalculated based on GOA\u2019s long-term bond rate and a margin. The analysis assumes that the \nADB loan is passed through to GOA, ASEB, and AEGCL in Indian rupees with the interest rate \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

An increase in approved return on equity by \nAERC to reflect the new Central Electricity Regulatory Commission norms of 15.5% for central transmission \ncompanies would provide an upside to the FIRR calculations. \n ", "Appendix 14     57 \n \nincluding allowance for the Government\u2019s foreign exchange premium.

Calculation of Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n6.  The FIRR is calculated at 7.41%. The rates for the individual projects compare favorably \nwith the estimated WACC at 2.10%, substantiating the financial viability of the transmission \nprojects.  \n \nD.   Risk Assessment and Sensitivity Analyses \n \n7.  External  Risks.  Tariff-related  risk  for  the  transmission  projects  may  be  considered \nminimal since AERC is to be guided by the tariff determination methodology proposed by the \nCentral  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  for  regulation  and  tariff  setting  for  interstate \ntransmission licensees. In general compared to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, \ncertain relaxation in tariff norms is permitted by the state regulator given that state transmission \nutilities  are  still  some  way  from  achieving  the  performance  of  the  interstate  transmission \nlicensee. The tariff is based on full-cost recovery with an allowed rate of return on equity. If \nnecessary, regulated entities could submit revised asset capitalization and financing plans, and \nAERC would in normal course adjust tariffs accordingly. Unilateral tariff revisions are unlikely as \nAEGCL would have recourse to a public hearing process before AERC and the Appellate \nTribunal, if required, to establish its case. Volume risk is also minimal since the current system \nis peak-constrained, and demand is expected to constantly grow as consumers revert to grid \npower. The typical geopolitical and political risks that are present for projects in India would \napply in this case. The overall risk perception of the project is deemed to be minimal. \n \n8.  Project-Specific Risks. Financial risks for projects include the following: (i) an increase \nin the price of civil works and equipment, (ii) delays in project implementation, and (iii) failure to \nhave access to necessary counterpart funds. These risks are considered low since (i) the cost \nestimates are based on recent tenders received, and advance procurement will reduce the time \nbetween loan effectiveness and disbursement; (ii) AEGCL\u2019s implementation capacity has been \nproven in recent project implementation, with further support to be provided under the capacity \ndevelopment component; and (iii) AEGCL\u2019s financial projections demonstrate satisfactory cash \nflows  throughout  the  forecast  period  to  meet  the  repayment  of  debt  associated  with  the \ninvestments, once projects are commissioned.  \n \n9.  Sensitivity Analysis. Analysis was carried out to examine the sensitivity of the FIRR \nand financial net present value to adverse changes in key variables. The variables considered \n ", "58     Appendix 14 \n   \n \nfor the sensitivity analyses are a 20% increase in capital costs, 20% increase in operation and \nmaintenance costs, and a 1-year implementation delay.  \n \n10.  Table  A14.2  demonstrates  that  the  results  are  robust  for  the  transmission  projects \nconsidered, with sensitivities exceeding the WACC. The project is most sensitive to capital cost \noverruns and delays. If a capital cost overrun occurred, AERC is expected to consider the cost \noverrun for inclusion in the tariff determination if the costs were prudently incurred or occurring \non account of factors outside AEGCL\u2019s control. \n \n \nTable A14.2: FIRR Sensitivity Analyses \n  FIRR  FNPV      \nItem  (%)  (Rs million) \nBase case  7.41  6,233 \n20% increase in capital cost   6.10  6,142 \n20% increase in O&M cost  6.99  5,707 \nOne-year implementation delay   6.31  5,314 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return; FNPV = financial net present \nvalue, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "Appendix 15     59 \n \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS FOR TRANSMISSION PROJECTS  \n1.  The Assam transmission system has several constraints that prevent the flow through of \nadequate power to meet the distribution system requirements. The proposed investment to be \nfunded by the multitranche financing facility in Assam would be part of a larger investment plan \nin Assam\u2019s transmission and distribution network. This investment proposal for transmission \nprojects  (in  tranche  1  and  tranche  2)  would  result  in  removing  constraints  in  the  state \ntransmission  system  thereby  allowing  utilization  of  power  available  from  the  interstate \ntransmission network to meet existing and incremental demand within Assam, improve the \ntransmission network reliability, and decrease the transmission losses.  \n \n2.  The power generation sources are owned by various central public sector utilities and \nconstitute  an  integral  component  of  the  National  Electricity  Plan  prepared  by  the  Central \nElectricity Authority (CEA). Power Grid Corporation of India Limited undertook the interstate \ntransmission network planning on a least-cost basis. The economic analysis of the investment \nproposal for transmission projects was carried out in accordance with Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. A time-slice approach was adopted for \nthe entire transmission investment as allocating costs and benefits to individual transmission \nsubprojects would be difficult. The economic analysis confirms that the investment proposal is \neconomically viable. \nA.  Demand and Supply Situation \n3.  India\u2019s economy has grown by nearly 8% per annum in recent years, and faces rapidly \ngrowing energy needs. Addressing the energy challenge is essential for fostering sustainable \neconomic growth. Taking into account India\u2019s energy security concerns, the Government of \nIndia (the Government) developed the Integrated Energy Policy (2006) to facilitate adequate \nand reliable energy supplies in a technically efficient, economically viable, and environmentally \nsustainable manner. Specific measures include reducing technical and commercial losses of \nstate transmission and distribution utilities, and increasing the focus on renewable sources. CEA \ndeveloped national electricity demand forecasts under the 17th Electric Power Survey (EPS) in \n2007. Peak load and energy requirements are based on actual figures for the 2 most recent \nyears and estimates of peak demand and energy until 2012, available in the EPS report (Table \nA15.1). \nTable A15.1: National and State Demand Forecasting \nAll India  Assam  Assam \nYear \n(GW)  (GW)  All India (MU)  (MU) \n2007/08  113,059  0,925  699,299  4,395 \n2008/09  121,891  1,034  757,287  4,922 \n2009/10  131,413  1,155  820,920  5,653 \n2010/11  141,678  1,291  891,203  6,529 \n2011/12  152,746  1,443  968,659  7,585 \n      GW = giga-watt, MU = million units \n Source: Central Electricity Authority. 2008{Year}. 17th Electric Power Survey.(India). \n ", "60     Appendix 15 \n \n \nTable A15.2: Revised Energy Scenario in Assam \n  Peak Demand (MW)  Energy (MU) \nYear  Requirement  Met  Requirement  Met \n2007\u20132008a  848  766  4,097  4,079 \n2011\u20132012  1,443  -  7,585  - \nMU = million units, MW = mega watt          \n a Figures for the year 2007\u20132008 are for April\u2013February. \nSource(s): Central Electricity Authority and Assam State Electricity Board. \n5.  In 2008, Assam\u2019s projections of peak demand requirement was 848 megawatts (MW), a \nreduction of about 8% against the 925 MW projected under the EPS. However, two independent \nprojections indicate the peak demand requirement in 2012 would be 1,443 MW, in line with 17th \nEPS estimates. Importantly, the peak demand met by the Assam power system in 2008 was \nonly 766 MW. Seasonal unavailability of generation coupled with constraints in the transmission \nand distribution network are considered responsible for not meeting the peak requirement of \npower. CEA estimates indicate that generation capacity would be adequate to meet Assam\u2019s \ndemand and create surpluses commencing from 2012. However, load flow studies indicate that \nunless the transmission and distribution infrastructure in Assam is substantially enhanced and \naccess to consumers extended, the available power would not likely be able to flow through the \nexisting network to meet Assam\u2019s end consumer power requirements.  \n6.  The  least-cost  planning  proposal  required  for  strengthening  and  improving  the \ntransmission system to meet the projected peak demand and energy requirement was identified \nbased  on  load-flow  studies  carried  out  on  the  Assam  Electricity  Grid  Corporation  Limited \n(AEGCL) transmission system. The projects considered under tranches 1 and 2 do not factor in \nany distribution network expansion investments (which are to be undertaken under tranche 3). \nPower available to the Assam network is expected to cater to meeting some proportion of \nincremental  demand  as  well  as  replacement  of costlier  captive  generation  by  supply  from \ncheaper and predominantly cleaner sources of electricity. The impact of incremental load growth \non account of enhanced village and household electrification as well as the proposed reduction \nin distribution losses would be factored in the economic analysis for tranche 3. \nB.  Project Costs \n7.  The total economic cost of the transmission projects15 was taken at Rs9,246.3 million \nover 3 years from 2010 to 2012 as indicated in Table A15.3. The costs are expressed in \nconstant 2009 prices. The domestic price numeraire was used; tradable inputs were valued at \ntheir  border  price  equivalent  value  and  were  converted  to  domestic  equivalents  using  an \nestimated standard exchange rate factor for material. A conversion factor for labor cost is based \non  inputs  from  labor  cost  details  available  with  AEGCL.  Capital  costs  include  physical \ncontingencies,  but  exclude  taxes,  price  contingencies,  and  financial  charges  during \nconstruction.  The  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  the  tranche  1  project  proposals  were \nestimated by comparing with- and without-project scenarios.  \n8.  Under the without-project scenario, load flow studies indicate that contracted generation \ncapacity from outside the state would be considered sold by Assam to external purchasers \nbecause the constraints in the transmission system would prevent power flows into Assam. The \noperating generation costs are based on the opportunity cost of power and for economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) calculation purposes reflect border price equivalent value of Rs3.5/unit of \npower.  \n                                                 \n15  The transmission projects considered for economic analysis include both tranche 1 and tranche 2 projects. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                  Appendix 15      6 1\n9.  Under  the  with-project  scenario,  electricity  that  is  required  within  Assam  to  meet \ndistribution company requirements is considered delivered to the AEGCL network because of \nimprovements  in  the  transmission  system.  The  rest  of  the  power  is  available  for  sale  to \npurchasers  outside  the  state.  The  associated  annual  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  \nRs765 million annually are derived from the financial operation and maintenance cost of AEGCL \nusing appropriate conversion factors for labor and material costs. The economic cost of Power \nGrid Corporation of India Limited transmission charges that would be applicable for wheeling \npower from project sites through interstate lines to input points for the AEGCL network is \ncalculated at Rs0.30/unit using appropriate conversion factors for labor cost and material cost. \nC.  Project Benefits \n10.  The economic benefits of the without-project scenario would be sale of the power by the \nAssam  distribution  companies  to  purchasers  outside  the  state  in  absence  of  adequate \ntransmission capacity to deliver the power to consumers within the state. The quantum of power \navailable for external sale ranges from 1,226 MU in 2012 to 5,260 MU for 2015 and onward for \nthe purpose of EIRR computation. In the with-project scenario, the following economic benefits \nare identified: \n(i)  Replacement  of  diesel-based  captive  generation  (tea  gardens  and  major \nindustries currently depend on captive generation options due to unavailability of \npower supply from distribution companies). The quantum of power is based on \nprevious load flow studies in Assam and ranges from 107 MU in 2012 to 810 MU \nin 2020. This is considered as nonincremental consumption in the system and \nthe economic value is based on the resource cost savings that would accrue. \nThe  economic  cost  of  captive  diesel-based  generation  is  computed  at  \nRs7.5 /unit. \n(ii)  The second component of the power is used to meet the existing shortfall of \npower in Assam (the quantum of power is based on CEA reports and ranges \nfrom 141 MU in 2012 to 497 MU in 2020)\u2014largely for smaller domestic and \n16\ncommercial customers and is valued at the willingness to pay for power  for \nthose consumer categories. \n(iii)  In  addition,  the  impact  of  reduction  of  transmission  losses  because  of  the \nphysical investment that ADB would make in the system through refurbishment of \nexisting subtransmission stations and reactive power compensation schemes \nwas also considered for evaluation of benefits. This is valued at the marginal cost \nof power procured by LAEDCL.17 \n11.  The economic cost of generation considered for the EIRR computation in the with-\nproject scenario is computed based on the opportunity cost for the power that would otherwise \nhave  been  sold  to  customers  outside  Assam  in  the  without-project  scenario.  The  residual \nquantum of power (ranging from 978 MU in 2012 to 3953 MU in 2020) in the with-project \nscenario is expected to be sold to consumers outside the state.  \n                                                 \n16   Willingness to pay estimates are assumed at Rs5.1/kilowatt-hour for domestic consumers, Rs2.5/kilowatt-\nhour for commercial consumers in the region.

Estimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n12.  The basis for transmission project economic evaluation is a comparison of benefits and \ncosts  between  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  A  period  of  25  years  is  used  for \neconomic evaluation, including 3 years of capital investment and construction. Investment is \nassumed to take place between 2010 and 2012, and benefits are expected to be realized from \nthe first year of operation. Residual values are estimated for transmission investment based on \na 40-year economic life for state transmission.

Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n13.  The risks for the transmission projects to achieve an EIRR of 16.80% are identified from \nthe perspective of both costs and benefits. Cost risks include delay in program implementation, \nand increases in capital and operating costs. Benefit risks include consumers\u2019 willingness to pay \nas derived from an ADB study. If the state experiences significantly lower economic growth that \nresults in a dampening of demand for electricity and consumers\u2019 willingness to pay, the program \nbenefits would be lower.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe power sector in India has great potential to contribute to economic development and social well-being, but infrastructure \nfacilities need to be expanded and managed more effectively to ensure consistent economic growth. Development of the \npower sector is connected to poverty reduction. Clean power development ensures that the poor will benefit, as they bear a \nlarger share of the adverse impacts of pollution and environmental degradation. Also, stable power supplies promote business \nexpansion and increase employment opportunities, which can have a positive impact on poverty reduction. \n \nThe multitranche financing facility (MFF)-has intrinsic scope for poverty reduction. It will bring direct and indirect positive social \nimpacts. This will specifically benefit people living in remote areas through improved frequency and voltage for various uses. \nThis will ultimately result in socioeconomic growth. Electricity is a key input for socioeconomic development. Efficient and \nreliable provision of electricity contributes to poverty reduction through economic growth, and is central to the basic human \nneeds of health and education. Poor and vulnerable consumers, as well as social utilities such as hospitals, and schools, are \noften particularly disadvantaged by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and inadequate power quality; and will therefore \nbenefit directly from the Investment Program. Direct positive economic and social benefits will result. In addition, a better \nsupply of electricity will enable farmers to set up high-powered pump sets that will contribute to better crop yields. The \nInvestment Program is expected to generate considerable employment in terms of skilled and unskilled labor during \nconstruction. Finally, social services in Assam will improve as poor and vulnerable consumers (including hospitals, schools, \nand other social utilities) that are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and inadequate power quality, \nwill benefit directly. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n1.   Key Issues  \n \nThe economy of Assam is overwhelmingly agricultural. According to the Census 2001, 52.65% of the total workforce in the \nstate (58.40% in India) is engaged in agricultural and allied activities. The total cropped area (1999/2000) is 4.087 million \nhectares and the total net area sown 2.734 million hectares. The urban population comprises 12.90% of the total population. \nAbout 36.09% of the state's population continues to live below the poverty line, considerably above the national average of \n26.10% (1999/2000). The rural\u2013urban divide is illustrated by 40% of rural residents being likely to live below the poverty line, \ncompared with less than 10% in urban areas. Assam has levels and rates of growth of income below the average for the \ncountry and the gap is widening. In 1950/51, Assam's per capita income was 4.1% higher than the average for the country; by \n1980/81 it was 27% lower than the national average, and by 1998/99 it was 45.5% lower. Inequity also exists between \nregions; the per capita income of the district with the highest income is more than three times that of the district with the \nlowest. According to 1994/95 estimates, the district of N.C. Hills recorded the highest per capita income of Rs3,464 and \nDarrang recorded the lowest at Rs1,100. Assam's per capita income in constant prices (1993/94) stands at Rs6,157 and at \ncurrent prices (2000/01) Rs10,198. The incidence of unemployment, measured as a percentage of the labor force is \nincreasing in Assam. Unemployment rates in Assam in 1983 were 2.2%, as compared with 2.0% for the country. By \n1999/2000, the country's unemployment rate had risen marginally to 2.3%, while Assam's unemployment rate had risen \nsubstantially to 4.6%.  \n \nThe Investment Program will create employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor during implementation. The local \npopulation will benefit as it will be provided with a more secure and reliable source of electricity. Contractors are expected to \nhire skilled and unskilled workers for 5 years of civil works. Jobs will be available beyond the construction phase throughout \nthe projects' life cycles. Approximately 172,200 person-days of employment will be generated due to construction of the \nprojects under tranche 1, which will employ 40% skilled workers and 60% unskilled laborers. \n \n2. Design Features. No direct impact on poverty is envisaged to occur as result of Investment Program implementation. \nNonetheless, it will have indirect impacts on both Assam and India. \n \n ", "Appendix 16     65 \n \n \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Investment Program will have positive impacts in terms of health and education conditions, and facilities are expected to \nimprove in Assam as well as the rest of the country due to the access to more reliable electricity. A social analysis was carried \nout in the program area for the tranche 1 component, using a sample socioeconomic household survey. The average family \nsize is 5.91, and the sex ratio of the project-affected population is 871:1000. Literacy is reported to be 79%. About 95% of the \nhouseholds report practicing agriculture as the main economic activity. In the project areas, about 60% of households report \nhaving land. The average possession of land is 0.5 ha and about 57% land is reported to be cultivable. Rice is mostly \ncultivated by households living in the project area and a few households report cultivating vegetables. The total average \nannual income of households in the project area is Rs106,255. The annual household expenditure reported is Rs86,496; \nabout 52% of the expenditure is incurred for food, 7.7% for education and 5.33% for health. Indebtedness among households \nin the project-affected area is not common. Nearly one fifth (19%) of the surveyed households report that a family member \nsuffered from major illness during the last year. Malaria and appendicitis are common. Migration is not common; only 7.41% \nreport that a member migrated during the last year. In addition to household activities, the women of the sampled households \nare engaged in productive activities like cultivation, labor both agricultural and nonagricultural, household industries, and silk \nweaving. Women\u2019s participation in decision making is reported from 38% of the households The major sources of drinking \nwater are springs, which are usually distributed through pipes (55.56%). One fourth of the households report not having a \nlatrine. Liqufied Petroleum Gas is the major source of fuel used by households (55.56%) for cooking followed by wood \n20.99%. The average age of structures is 18.34 years. Most of the houses, i.e., about 54% are of brick. Similarly 59% of \nhouseholds are permanent, followed by 30.86% semipermanent. The average number of rooms per structure, according to \nthe survey, is 4.33, of which 3.74 on average have electric lights. About 60% of households are electrified. The main source of \nelectrification is the government grid. The average hours of consumption of electricity and supply is 13.14 hours. Of the \nsurveyed households, 90% report having meters that are regulated on a regular basis. Those without meters report paying a \nminimum charge to the electricity department. The average number of electric lamps per households is 4.14, followed by fans \n3.18, televisions 1.06, washing machines 0.18, and water pumps 0.18. The average consumption among the 44 metered \nhouseholds is 55 units; the average expenditure per household for electricity is only Rs191. About one fourth (24.49%) \nreported an incidence of power theft in their area. The majority (about 68%) report that they would provide support to control \npower theft in their area. The households with electricity report using kerosene and/or diesel, wood, and gas as alternate \nenergy along with electricity. Of households without electricity, 59.38% use batteries for lighting their house, and 92.5% stated \nthat they would pay an electricity bill regularly if electricity was provided and admitted that they can afford an average increase \nin electricity up to 8.94% of the current bill. About one fourth (24.69%) of the households opined that the usage of electricity \nwill increase in future. About 69.14% report that the Investment Program will help increase the living standard of the people in \ntheir area.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultations were carried out with all the stakeholders including civil society and nongovernment organizations during \nprogram preparation. As an integral part of safeguards planning, affected communities and affected people were directly and \nfully involved in project preparation and design. All stakeholders were informed and the stream of information will continue \nduring the implementation.  \n \n2.

Local communities and affected people \nwere consulted throughout the preparation process to minimize impacts, ensure social acceptance, and increase equitability. \nThe  process  will  continue  during  project  implementation.  Views  and  concerns  of  all  stakeholders  will  be  taken  into \nconsideration and addressed whenever feasible. Finally, local customs, religious practices, and traditional activities were \nconsidered as a fully integrated part of the preparation process to avoid discrimination and/or disruption of activities, as \nminimization measures.  \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. No particular issue is expected as a result of project implementation. Nonetheless, additional compensation \nwill be awarded to households headed by women as they are considered to be more vulnerable. \n \n ", "66     Appendix 16 \n   \n \n2.  Key Actions.

Yes     \u25a1   No     \n ", "                                                                                           Appendix 17    67 \nSUMMARY OF SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n1.  The proposed multitranche financing facility (MFF) objective is to attain inclusive economic \ngrowth  sector  development  in  Assam  through  (i)  transmission  capacity  expansion,  (ii) \ntransmission  and  distribution  loss  reduction,  (iii)  access  to  power,  and  (iv)  distribution \nfranchising. The Government of Assam and the Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB) will be \nthe  executing  agencies.  This  is  a  short  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  the  tranche  1 \ncomponents, which include construction of substations, transmission lines, and augmentation \nand/or expansion of existing substations. \n \nA.  Impact on Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n2.  An assessment of land acquisition and resettlement was carried out for the tranche 1 \nprojects. They have minimized resettlement by adopting adequate engineering solutions in their \ndesign  through  proper  involvement  of  all stakeholders.  No  relocation  is  anticipated  as  the \nprojects  include  transmission  components  that  entail  minimal  land  acquisition.  Of  the  \n6 substations, 3 will be constructed on government land, which is free from any use. Two \nsubstations  are  proposed  to  be  constructed  on  barren  land  of  the  tea  garden  owner  and \ncompany, and the remaining 1 substation will require private land acquisition. Approximately \n24.09 hectares (ha) will be required for the substations: 12.04 ha of private land and 12.04 ha of \ngovernment land. The construction of transmission lines (262 kilometers) will not require any \npermanent land acquisition, but will have a temporary effect on crops during construction. Of the \n9 households affected, 4 are scheduled tribe households that will lose a strip of land of not more \nthan 10% of their productive assets. Adequate measures and entitlement are addressed in the \nresettlement plan. Of the 22 affected people, 12 are male and 10 are female; 6 households \naffected are vulnerable. None of the affected households are severely affected as they are not \nlosing more than 10% of their productive assets.

Policy, Legal Framework, and Entitlement Matrix \n3.  The policy framework and entitlements for the MFF-supported projects are based on \nnational laws: the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended in 1984) and the National Rehabilitation \nand Resettlement Policy, 2007; and the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Core involuntary resettlement principles to be followed for each \nproject, including tranche 1 projects, are (i) land acquisition, and other involuntary resettlement \n ", "68   Appendix 17   \nimpacts will be avoided or minimized by exploring all viable alternative subproject designs;  \n(ii) where resettlement cannot be avoided, time-bound resettlement plans will be prepared and \naffected people will be assisted in improving or at least regaining their preproject standard of \nliving;  (iii)  consultation  with  affected  people  on  compensation,  disclosure  of  resettlement \ninformation  to  affected  people,  and  participation  of  affected  people  in  planning  and \nimplementing  projects  will  be  ensured;  (iv)  vulnerable  groups  will  be  provided  special \nassistance;18 (v) payment of compensation to affected people including nontitled persons (e.g., \ninformal dwellers and/or squatters, and encroachers) for acquired assets at replacement rates; \n(vi) payment of compensation and resettlement assistance prior to the contractor taking physical \nacquisition  of  the  land  and  prior  to  the  commencement  of  any  construction  activities;  \n(vii) provision of income restoration and rehabilitation; and (viii) establishment of appropriate \ngrievance redress mechanisms. A detailed description of each compensation measure and \nassistance is provided in the entitlement matrix (Table A16.2). Affected people will be entitled to \na  combination  of  compensation  measures  and  resettlement  assistance,  depending  on  the \nnature of ownership rights of lost assets and scope of the impact, including social and economic \nvulnerability of the affected people.  \n \nTable A16.2: Entitlement Matrix \nDefinition of \nNo Type of \nApplication  Entitled  Entitlement \n.

Institutional Arrangements \n \n4.  The government of Assam and ASEB will function as the executing agencies for the \nMFF.  Assam  Power  Generation  Corporation  Limited  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation of projects for transmission systems, and Lower \nAssam Electricity Distribution Company Limited the Implementing Agency for distribution system \nprojects. ASEB, already has a functioning project management unit (PMU), which implemented \nthe  ADB-financed  Assam  Power  Sector  Development  Program.  It  is  responsible  for  the \npreparatory work for the MFF. An environment and social management unit (ESMU) will be set \nup within the PMU along with other engineering units to address environmental and social \nissues that arise. The ESMU will be headed by an environment specialist and resettlement \nspecialist, assisted by one environment and one social development\u2013resettlement specialist \nwho will be responsible for field activities. The PMU will be responsible for overall coordination, \npreparation, planning, implementation, and financing. The ASEB will ensure that key institutions \nincluding  local  governments  are  involved  in  resettlement  plan  preparation,  updating,  and \nimplementation.  \n ", "70   Appendix 17   \n \nD.  Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance \n \n5.  Consultations were carried out with various government officials and local communities \nconcerned as part of the social and resettlement study to gather their views on the Tranche 1 \nprojects.  All  affected  people  were  consulted  on  a  one-to-one  basis  through  questionnaire \nsurveys for the project activities. Additionally, focus group discussions were carried out at all the \nproposed substation sites and along the transmission corridors. Local residents expressed their \ncooperation for smooth project implementation. The consultation process will be continued \nduring the entire project cycle. The resettlement plan for tranche 1 was translated to Assamese \nlocal language, and was made available at relevant government offices, ASEB project site \noffices, and the PMU. The resettlement plan for the tranche 1 projects was disclosed before the \nfirst ADB management review meeting and placed on the ADB website. An efficient grievance \nredress  mechanism  will  be  developed  to  assist  affected  people  resolve  their  queries  and \ncomplaints.  Each  resettlement  plan  will  detail  specific  grievance  redress  mechanisms. \nGrievances of affected people will first be brought to the attention to the site office of the \nconcerned implementing agency. Grievances not redressed by the implementing agency field \nstaff  will  be  brought  to  the  grievance  redress  committee.  The  committee  will  have \nrepresentatives from affected people, PMU, implementing agency, ESMU, field staff, district \nmagistrate and/or commissioner, local administration, revenue authority, and local community. \n \nE.  Resettlement Budget and Fund Flow Mechanism \n \n6.  The  resettlement  cost  estimate  for  the  first  trance  projects  includes  eligible \ncompensation, resettlement assistance, and support cost for resettlement plan implementation. \nThese are part of the overall project cost. The total land acquisition and resettlement cost is \nestimated to be Rs17.89 million. Land acquisition and resettlement costs will be considered as \nan integral component of subproject costs. ASEB will make the funds available in its annual \nbudget for the disbursement of compensation and assistance. \n \nF.  Implementation Schedule, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n \n7.  All land acquisition, resettlement, and compensation will be completed before the start of \ncivil works. All land required will be provided free of encumbrances to the contractor prior to \nhanding  over  the  project  sites  and  the  start  of  civil  works.  Internal  monitoring  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the PMU of ASEB. External monitoring will be done by an external monitoring \nconsultant. \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nASSAM POWER SYSTEM - PROBLEM TREE  \n \n2003 [Activities] 2009 [Activities] 2014\n \n[Sub-Causes] Assam SDP Assam SDP Assam SDP\n14600 INR/capita 18598 INR/capita  26987 INR/ capita  \n[Core Problem]\nWeak Power Generation  Total\u00a0Capacity 2003 \u00a0Total\u00a0Capacity 2009 Total\u00a0Capacity\n1,031\u00a0MW Assam Power Sector  1,062\u00a0MW MFF: Assam Power Sector  2668\u00a0MW\nPoverty Weak Interstate  Hydro\u00a0+\u00a0Gas\u00a0+\u00a0 Development Program Hydro\u00a0+\u00a0Gas\u00a0+\u00a0 Enhancement  Investment  Hydro\u00a0+\u00a0Gas\u00a0+\u00a0\nRenewable\u00a0 Renewable\u00a0 Program Renewable\u00a0\nTransmission Sector\n\u00a0(879\u00a0MW) (868\u00a0MW) \u00a0(2114\u00a0MW)\n[State Transmission & \nTransmission\u00a0\nDistribtuion Subsector] Trans.\u00a0Capacity\u00a0\nCapacity\u00a0480\u00a0 Trans.\u00a0Capacity\u00a0\n1.
