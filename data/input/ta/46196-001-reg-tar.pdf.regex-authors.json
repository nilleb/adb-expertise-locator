INTRODUCTION  \n1.  The fragmentation of production processes and the rise of global supply chains (GSCs) \nsince the 1980s have become increasingly important factors in linking developing countries to \ninternational production networks and markets. Today, a large share of production within GSCs \ntakes place in developing countries, especially in East Asia and Southeast Asia.  \n2.  Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) emphasizes the \u201cgreat promise \nthat regional cooperation and integration activities present for accelerating economic growth, \nraising productivity and employment, reducing economic disparities, and achieving closer policy \ncoordination and collaboration in support of regional and global public goods.\u201d1 The technical \nassistance (TA) contributes to this strategic priority by shedding light on poorly understood \naspects of the regional integration of production and by raising the capacity of ADB to formulate \npolicy advice on the basis of state-of-the-art data and methods for the analysis of GSCs in the \nregion.  In  cooperation  with  other  organizations\u2014the  Fung  Global  Institute;  the  Institute  of \nDeveloping Economies, Japan External Trade Organization (IDE-JETRO); the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD); and the World Trade Organization (WTO)\u2014\nthe TA will facilitate ADB\u2019s establishment as a contributing member within the nascent research \nconsortium focusing on these issues.2  \nII.   ISSUES \n3.  The international fragmentation of production has created the need for new measures of \ntrade that account for the value that is actually added by a country to the goods or services it \nexports, net of the imported value of intermediate parts and components, i.e., trade in value \nadded (TVA). By contrast, traditional trade statistics reflect gross value, thus double-counting \nthe  value  of  intermediates  as  they  cross  international  borders  multiple  times.  As  a  result, \ninternational trade statistics provide an inaccurate picture of trade involving heavily networked \neconomies. For example, domestic value added is estimated to account for roughly 60% of the \nexports value of the People\u2019s Republic of China while its trade surplus with the United States is \nthought to be overestimated by about 40%.3 Only by duly accounting for TVA can ADB research \nand policy advice be made reflective of the economic and social implications of production \nnetworks in the region. Moreover, TVA analysis assesses the impact of foreign demand or \nsupply shocks, such as those triggered by recent natural disasters in Japan and Thailand, as \nthey propagate through GSCs. \n4.  Analytical issues concern mainly the measurement of GSCs and vertical specialization \n(the foreign value added embedded within exports). The main approaches are (i) input\u2013output \nanalysis, associating inputs with industry outputs and identifying the source of those inputs; \n(ii) defining product categories using some descriptors like \u201cparts and components\u201d; (iii) firm-\nlevel data on foreign inputs, tracking both foreign input purchases and exports by firms; (iv) the \nuse of processing trade data, such as are available for the People\u2019s Republic of China, to \nassess the value added on imported goods that are officially designated for further processing \nand re-export; (v) multinational firm data, especially datasets that provide information on affiliate \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Koopman et al. 2010. Give Credit Where Credit Is Due: Tracing Value Added in Global Production Chains. \nNBER Working Paper Series. No. w16426. Cambridge: National Bureau of Economic Research; R.C. Johnson and \nG. Noguera. 2012. Accounting for Intermediates: Production Sharing and Trade in Value Added. Journal of \nInternational Economics. 86(2). March 2012. \n ", "2   \nsales  or  intra-firm  trade.  The  TA  will  compare  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  these \napproaches with special reference to Asia\u2019s role in GSCs. \n5.  A further issue concerns the assessment of the determinants and structure of GSCs. \nSuch analysis typically has used measures of TVA as the dependent variable in regression \nanalysis focused on understanding if trade of this sort behaves differently from other trade, e.g., \nis more sensitive to trade costs. The literature is still extremely thin on these issues and the TA \ncan do much to shed light on the drivers of and impediments to GSCs and TVA in Asia.  \n6.  Finally, there is a key issue concerning offshoring and its effects on firms and labor \nmarkets. Such analysis has to rely mainly on firm-level data, which is becoming increasingly \navailable. Because these datasets also include firm-level characteristics and are in some cases \nlinked to employment databases, analysis can now go much further in understanding why \nindividual firms choose to produce with foreign value added, and how this affects their outcomes \n(e.g., in productivity or wages). \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA will bring ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department (ERD) up to speed with \nthe recent advances in the methods and data for the analysis of TVA and GSCs, so its research \noutputs can better support policymaking in developing member countries (DMCs). Based on the \nlatest international input\u2013output tables, multinational firm data on foreign inputs, processing \ntrade data, and incorporating recent progress by scholarly research in the field, the TA will seek \nto develop tools for TVA analysis that shed light on Asia\u2019s supply chains, their determinants, and \ntheir impact on development in Asia. Apart from publishing findings in working papers and in a \nvolume targeted at both scholarly and policy-oriented audiences, the TA will establish ADB as a \nrecognized research partner of the nascent consortium of organizations and think tanks that \ncollaborate in this field (such as ADBI, the Fung Global Institute, IDE-JETRO, OECD, and \nWTO). \n8.  The impact will be greater awareness of DMC policymakers of the nature and impact of \nglobal supply chains in national economic growth and development. The outcome will be a \ndeeper understanding of the nature and role of GSCs and TVA as it involves DMCs and \ndeveloping Asia as a region.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will conduct selected case studies of GSCs in Asia through joint research and \npublications with partner organizations in the region. In addition, it will hire leading experts of \nglobal value chain analysis as authors for an ADB book project on GSCs in Asia. Research is \nenvisaged to focus on the following:4 \n(i)  Measurement methods. Review alternative approaches to measuring TVA and \nlatest data available for analysis and assess how methodological choices reflect \non Asia\u2019s representation within GSCs. \n(ii)  Correlates and determinants of GSCs and TVA. Inferential analysis with a \nfocus on pertinent policy links, such as whether GSCs are more sensitive to \ninfrastructure, trade facilitation indicators, or exchange rate variability. In addition, \n                                                 \n4 This is an interim list subject to change. A refined research agenda for individual chapters will be determined by the \nfourth quarter of 2012.  \n ", "  3 \nTVA measures will be used to empirically review our perceptions on key policy \nissues for the region, such as exchange rate pass-through or the responsiveness \nof trade to tariff liberalization.  \n(iii)  Concept of \u201clabor value added in trade.\u201d For countries employing borrowed \ncapital  in  production,  the  concept  of  \u201cdomestic  value  added\u201d  represents  an \ninaccurate metric as it incorporates both labor and capital. TA research will thus \nattempt to refocus input\u2013output analysis on the value added by purely local factor \ninputs, mainly labor. Relevant policy implications will be discussed.  \n(iv)  Supply chain disruptions and demand shocks. Analyze the impact of supply \nshocks on GSCs, whether caused by natural disasters or ascribable to principal-\nagent issues, and also of demand shocks (e.g., recessions, secular declines of \nan industry) radiating up the supply chain. Research will also assess the risks \nand  benefits  associated  with  alternative  diversification  strategies  for  Asian \nsuppliers within GSCs and derive policy conclusions.  \n(v)  Role of services in supply chains. Assess key GSC services in Asia, such as \ncargo transportation, passenger aviation, business services (finance, marketing, \nintermediation),  and  discuss  the  need  for  policy  reforms  that  are  sufficiently \nbroad-based to include services.  \n(vi)  Location analysis of industries\u2019 position. Build on recently devised measures \nof a country\u2019s position within GSCs and assess DMC potential and hindrances to \nmoving upstream. \n(vii)  TVA-corrected  macroeconomic  indicators.  Determine  international  trade\u2019s \ncontribution  to  economic  growth,  the  extent  of  bilateral  trade  balances,  or \nexchange rates. Again, with focus on DMCs.  \n(viii)  International trade regulations and regional agreements. Working papers on \nthe impact of international trade regulations and regional agreements on GSCs \nand TVA, arising out of the TA as well as partnering organizations\u2019 research \nactivities in this field, for discussion at joint conferences during the course of this \nproject. \n \n10.  A better understanding of the nature and role of GSCs and TVA as it involves DMCs and \ndeveloping Asia as a region (the expected outcome of the TA) will be achieved through the \npublication of a TA book, working papers and other publications (the expected outputs), the \nfindings of which will be disseminated through conferences and seminars. \n11.  The TA rests on the assumptions that (i) top experts, including a lead economist, can be \nhired  to  provide  technical  inputs  and  write  research  papers  of  the  highest  professional \nstandards; (ii) the TA volume will be accepted by a leading publisher; (iii) the findings will \nresonate  in  the  rhetoric  and  policy  of  relevant  international  and  national  institutions  and \norganizations, as well as in DMC government circles.  \n12.  The key risks are that (i) leading experts cannot be hired for some of the subprojects \nenvisioned for the TA; (ii) ERD will not sufficiently absorb the technologies introduced by the TA, \nand will be unable to reflect them in policy notes, reports, and working papers; and (iii) the data \n(international  input\u2013output,  processing  trade,  firm-level)  available  for  research  have  limited \ncoverage on DMCs or are of low quality.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV).  \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months (1 September 2012\u201331 August 2014). ADB, \nthrough ERD\u2019s Macroeconomics and Finance Research Division, will be the executing agency. \nERD will also cooperate with OREI and ADBI, in particular by seeking their comments on drafts \nand their involvement in conferences as discussants or with their own papers on the topic.   \n15.  The TA will engage individual consultants with demonstrated expertise on GSC and TVA \nanalysis, and trade empirics more broadly. Individual hiring is justified by the need to engage \nthe best experts available in this highly specialized field of research. The TA will first hire a lead \neconomist who will be an established expert in international input\u2013output and GSC analysis. \nThe lead economist will assist the ADB team leader in specifying detailed research plans and \nsubsequently coordinating the inputs of the consultants hired as authors of chapters for the TA \nvolume. In addition, the TA will hire experts for preparing up to two case studies in collaboration \nwith  partner  organizations  such  as  the  Fung  Global  Institute.  Overall,  the  TA  will  engage \n13.5 person-months  of  international  consultant  inputs  and  3\u20136  person-months  of  national \nconsultant  inputs.  The  team  leader  will  manage  the  combined  outputs  to  achieve  the  TA \nobjectives.  \n16.  Consultants\u2019 terms of reference are outlined in Appendix 3. Individual consultants will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended time to time). All the procurement to be \nfinanced under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  TA  will  coordinate  arrangements  for  external \npublications with ADB\u2019s Department of External Relations.  \n17.  The TA will explore opportunities for joint research, publications, and dissemination \nevents with partner institutions such as ADBI, the Fung Global Institute, IDE-JETRO, OECD, \nand WTO. The proposed work and responsibilities will be divided among the partners, which will \ncontrol and allocate their own resources.  \n18.  The ADB team leader will monitor and evaluate the progress of the consultants hired, \nwith the support of the lead economist. The primary mechanism for disseminating the research \nfindings will be a book publication, ERD working papers, and inputs to the Asian Development \nOutlook.5 In addition to publications, the TA will conduct workshops and conferences, jointly with \nthe use of mass media for a broader dissemination of the TA outputs. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nGlobal Supply Chains and Trade in Value Added, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n5 ADB.
