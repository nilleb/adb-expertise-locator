THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  facility  will  provide  project  preparation, \nimplementation, and capacity building support for ensuing and ongoing regional cooperation and \nintegration (RCI) projects in Mongolia and an approved multitranche financing facility (MFF) in the \nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). These RCI \nprojects will strengthen the coordination between the two neighboring countries in addressing the \ncross-border development challenges, especially in tackling cross-border risks through efforts \nsuch as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures. Improving SPS measures to meet the \ninternational standards is essential to facilitate customs and border-crossing procedures, sustain \ninclusive growth, and foster economic diversification in Mongolia. The TA will expand regional \npublic  goods  (RPGs)  by  supporting  cross-border  public  health  infrastructure  and  services \n(including SPS measures); mitigating transboundary public health risks; strengthening resilience \nto climate change; and integrating sustainable protection of ecosystems and the environment in \nthe project design and implementation.1  \n \n2.  Based  on  the  Staff  Instructions  on  MFF2 of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \npreparation of projects under the second and subsequent tranches is to be financed under the \nearlier tranches unless otherwise justified in the report and recommendation of the President.3 \nUnder the IMAR MFF, a provision is made for using TA funds for the preparation of the \nsubsequent tranches when extensive safeguard or other due diligence requirements arise or \nchanges occur during implementation. It is expected that several pre-identified subprojects will be \nreplaced due to changes in the government financing arrangements. This will result in the need \nfor extensive safeguard due diligence, environment and climate risk assessments, financial \nmanagement assessments, and economic and financial analyses on the subprojects, which will \nrequire the support from the TA facility. Accordingly, part of the TA facility will support ADB to \nundertake the due diligence and meet other bank requirements for preparing tranches 2 and 3 of \nthe MFF.  \n \n3.  Border constraints and untapped mutual benefits. Limited transport connectivity and \ncontinued disparity of customs inspection, SPS services and clearance processes at key border-\ncrossing points between Mongolia and the PRC\u2019s neighboring IMAR are constraining Mongolia\u2019s \ninternational  trade  potential  and  the  development  of  its  remote  borders.  The  RCI  projects \nsupported by the facility will address these constraints and spur economic development in \nMongolia and its border economic zones, as well as generate the economic and employment \nspillover benefits from the project in IMAR. Expanding economic inclusion and crucial services in \nand around IMAR border communities will enhance livelihoods and generate economic gains on \nboth sides of the border. These efforts will also contribute to the transport and development goals \nof the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program, especially along its Corridor 4.4 \n \n4.  Promoting  regional  public  goods  and  strengthening  coordination.  Effective, \n \n \n1  Regional  public  goods  produce  public  benefits  that  extend  beyond  a  country\u2019s  borders  in  a  region.  ADB. \n2021.Regional Public Goods in Asia and Europe. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2018. Staff Instruction on Business Process for Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila. \n3  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Inner Mongolia Sustainable Cross-Border \nDevelopment Investment Program (footnote 27) and indicative subprojects under tranches 2 and 3 are listed in Linked \nDocument 8 (Facility Administration Manual, Appendix 12, pp141\u2013146). \n4  Mongolia proposes to expand connectivity along the economic corridors to improve local economic development, \nenvironmental sustainability, and transboundary disaster risk management. The PRC\u2019s IMAR is focusing on \nstrengthening sustainable development, environmental protection, and climate change resilience.   \n \n ", "2   \nintegrated,  long-term  coordination  is  required  between  Mongolia  and  IMAR  to  strengthen \ninstitutional capacities to address cross-sectoral constraints. Experience shows that coordination \nof multiple public agencies to implement and modernize SPS measures is essential for ensuring \nfood safety and the enforcement of health standards for animals and plants transported across \nborders. Introducing new regional approaches to transboundary health risks requires (i) cross-\nborder coordination mechanisms for policies, regulations, and enforcement mechanisms; (ii) joint \ncustoms control initiatives; and (iii) greater focus on SPS measures for RCI projects in Mongolia \nand the IMAR. \n \n5.  Need for better design, implementation, monitoring, and reporting. Project design \nand implementation approaches by the line agencies responsible for ADB projects in Mongolia and \nIMAR need to be strengthened and streamlined. Project preparation functions should be optimized, \nthe processes better understood, and effective due diligence carried out to achieve sustainable \nresults. The TA facility will address these issues through development of effective communication \nplans, implementation monitoring templates, reporting formats, and deliverable records. \n \n6.  Generating better project results. Project implementation has been less than satisfactory \non both sides of the border, but especially in Mongolia. Poor project management, start-up delays, \nand prolonged implementation are related to government staff\u2019s inexperience and unfamiliarity with \nADB procedures. Compliance with social and environmental safeguards has also been weak. The \nproject preparation activities to be supported by the TA facility will respond to these challenges by \nfocusing closely and effectively on quality project design, due diligence, and line agencies\u2019 \ncapacity, enabling timely, and successful implementation. \n \n7.  Removing institutional  constraints. Institutional  weaknesses  of  local  governments \nreduce the potential for both countries to benefit from their cross-border cooperation.5 The \nprovincial and municipal governments play a major role in managing ADB financed projects in \nIMAR, since they are delegated with the authority to plan and implement investments of national \nand  transnational  significance.6 There are  rising  demands for  local  government  institutional \ncapacity as ADB\u2019s cross-border operations are becoming increasingly innovative, multisectoral, \nmultidimensional, and are focused on regional and global public goods.7 \n \n8.  The TA facility will have three components. The first is to ensure that projects prepared \nthrough the facility are robustly designed, viable, and design-ready at approval. The second will \nsupport the timely and effective implementation and long-term sustainability of the results of these \nprojects. The third will strengthen the coordination between the two countries to deliver stronger \nregional cooperation project outcomes and promote regional public goods. For Mongolia, the \nprojects that the TA facility will support include the (i) Developing the Economic Cooperation Zone \nProject, (ii) Regional Improvement of Border Services, (iii) Regional Upgrades of Sanitary and \nPhytosanitary Measures for Trade, and (iv) Resilient and Integrated Border Services for Safe and \nFast Trade. For the PRC, the TA facility will support the implementation of the first tranche and \npreparation of the second and third tranche under the Inner Mongolia Sustainable Cross-Border \n \n \n5  ADB. 2021.

It will amplify the \ninvestment  program\u2019s  strong  design  features  in  promoting  environmental  sustainability  and \nclimate change resilience, addressing cross border public health and other risks, and expanding \ndirect and spillover benefits to Mongolia.  \n \n9.  Alignment with Strategy 2030. The TA facility is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030\u2019s \nOperational Priority (OP) 7 covering (i) greater and higher quality and connectivity between \neconomies; (ii) global and regional trade and investment opportunities expanded; and (iii) regional \npublic goods increased and diversified, thereby fostering RCI by enhancing connectivity and \ncross-border infrastructure, transforming transport corridors into trade and economic corridors, \nhelping the developing member countries participate in regional and global value chains, and \npromoting RPGs by mitigating transboundary risks through SPS measures.9 The TA facility is also \naligned with OP 6 to strengthen governance and institutional capacities, along with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategies for Mongolia and the PRC in increasing environmental sustainability and \nresilience to climate change and disasters. The TA also supports OP 2, accelerating progress in \ngender equality. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  The TA facility, including capacity development during implementation, will promote cross-\nborder  trade  facilitation,  expand  RPGs  (particularly  those  relating  to  SPS  measures),  and \nenhance cross border connectivity. Special attention will be given to expanding the environment, \nsocial, and governance features in the projects to be designed and prepared.

Output  1:  Sound  cross-border  project  preparation  and  regional  public  goods \npromoted. Cross-border synergies between Mongolia and the PRC will maximize the projects\u2019 \nRPG benefits.10 The TA is expected to help develop an investment project to support Mongolia in \nfacilitating trade while increasing resilience to transboundary health risks for sustainable recovery. \nThe  ensuing  project\u2019s  RPG  component  is  envisaged  to  include:  (i)  provision  of  health \ninfrastructure facilities\u2014including testing laboratories\u2014to control the spread of transboundary \ndiseases; (ii) establishment of information systems and database for information-sharing among \nborder agencies and enhanced integration of systems with regional and global partners, guided \nby a One-Health approach; and (iii) strengthening of institutional capacity for testing, surveillance \nand management at the borders to prevent, detect, and respond quickly to transboundary human \nand animal disease outbreaks. Output 1 activities will also include support to the necessary due \ndiligence and other assessments for new subprojects under tranche 2 and 3 of the Inner Mongolia \nSustainable Cross-Border Development Investment Program.

The TA facility will support holistic measures to strengthen project preparation, such as (i) \nthe economic, financial, and governance due diligence activities; (ii) the formulation of investment \nplans  and  procurement  packages;  (iii)  assessments  of  the  financial  management  and \nprocurement capacity of the executing and implementing agencies; (iv) preparation of strategic \nprocurement  planning  documents;  (v)  due  diligence  on  environment,  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); and (vi) an \nassessment of the poverty, gender, and other social development issues related to the project. \nThe TA facility will ensure that the ensuing project in Mongolia and subprojects under the tranches \nof  the  Inner  Mongolia  Sustainable  Cross-Border  Development  Investment  Program  are \neconomically,  financially,  and  technically  feasible,  and  that  risks  related  to  safeguards  or \ngovernance are fully identified and mitigated. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Project  implementation  supported.  The  TA  facility  will  strengthen  the \ncapacity of the executing and implementing agencies and other entities to implement the RCI \nprojects  and  deliver  expected  development  results.  This  will  include  hands-on  project \nmanagement support, training, and mentoring during the implementation of the TA facility-\nsupported  projects  in  each  country.  Areas  covered  will  include  planning,  preparation, \nimplementation, and overall monitoring of the principles, processes, and procedures of ADB \nproject design and management. Training will also be provided in consultant recruitment, contract \nmanagement, and supervision, the review of engineering designs and cost estimates, mitigation \nof safeguard risks, and procurement. \n \n14.  Output  3:  Cross-border  coordination  to  deliver  stronger  project  outcomes \nstrengthened.  The  TA  facility  will  support  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies in Mongolia and the PRC\u2019s IMAR to design and carry out projects that \nenhance RCI. It will particularly promote institutional interlinkages between the targeted projects \non both sides of the border and enhance project and policy coordination for more sustainable and \neffective project outcomes. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,800,000, of which $200,000 will be provided from \nTASF-7; $800,000 will be provided on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFund;11 and $800,000 will be provided on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty \nReduction and Regional Cooperation Fund and administered by ADB.12 The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1.

A  second \ncomponent  will  upgrade  communication  infrastructure  for  Mongolia\u2019s \nautomated  customs  information  system  and  make  the  information  and \ncommunication  technology  systems  of  the  Mongolian  Customs  General \nAdministration  interoperable.  Preparatory  work  for  developing  the  single \nelectronic window will also be undertaken. \nMongolia: Regional  ADB approved $27 million in additional financing for Mongolia\u2019s Regional \nImprovement of Border  Improvement of Border Services Project to upgrade BCPs in Bichigt on the \nServices Project (Additional  country\u2019s border with the PRC in the east and in Borshoo on its frontier with \nFinancing)  the Russian Federation in the west.

The project will improve economic inclusion ecosystems and \nProgram (Tranche 1)  crucial services in five IMAR BCP communities and surrounding areas where \neconomic and social development is lagging, and poor health security and \nfragile ecosystems pose important transboundary risks to both countries. \nExpanded  financial  and  business  support  to  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  in  these  border  regions  will  spur  local  income  growth. \nEstablishment of an agricultural value chain will enhance livelihoods on both \nsides of the frontier, and land rehabilitation will diminish the adverse effects \non health, living conditions, and economic development of desertification. The \noverall  program  has  strong  spillover  benefits  for  Mongolia.  Better \ninfrastructure and services at IMAR-Mongolia BCPs will boost the volume and \nquality of trade, directly and indirectly creating about 3,300 jobs in Mongolia.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BCP = border-crossing point, CAREC = Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, \nIMAR = Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, MFF = multitranche financing facility, PRC = People's Republic of China, RCI \n= regional cooperation and integration, SPS = sanitary and phytosanitary measures. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2     9 \n \nTable A2.3: Indicative Consultants\u2019 Input Allocation for Output 1 and Output 3 \n(person-months) \nOutput 1 and Output 3 \nPRC: Inner \nMongolia \nMON: Resilient \nSustainable \nand Integrated \nCross-Border \nItem  Total  Border Services \nDevelopment \nfor Safe and Fast \nInvestment \nTrade \nProgram Tranche \n(Low) \n2 & Tranche 3 \n(Complex) \na.
