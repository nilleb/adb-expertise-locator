The Government of India requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA)1 for considering the possible options in devising voluntary privately \nmanaged  pension  schemes  that  could  be  offered  to  all  eligible  participants  from  the \nunorganized, or informal, sector of the Indian economy. The schemes to be proposed will \nattempt to provide a retirement savings instrument for meeting the old age security needs of \nIndia\u2019s  unorganized  sector  that  will  complement  existing  social  protection  arrangements \navailable  to  workers  in  the  formal  economy.  Accordingly,  a  TA  grant  in  the  amount  of \n$1,000,000 has been included for the above project in the Country Strategy and Program to \nIndia for 2003.  \n \n2.  An earlier TA2 was provided for designing a framework for structuring a more efficient, \ntransparent, and sustainable private sector pension and provident fund system in India.3 \n \n3.  The present TA proposal is part of ADB\u2019s continuing support to address the reform of \nIndia\u2019s pension system as part of domestic capital market development critical to moving the \ninfrastructure agenda and financing economic growth, and for meeting the social protection \nneeds of India\u2019s growing population as part of the effort to help the poor. A TA Fact-Finding \nMission visited India from 26 June to 1 July 2003 to discuss with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nand other key stakeholders concerned with the reform of India\u2019s pension system the possible \nscope of assistance and implementation requirements for the proposed TA. A staff consultant \n(pension expert) assisted the Mission and the Government in determining the key factors to \naddress in implementing the TA to meet the desired objectives of the Government. This report \nreflects the findings of the Mission and the understanding reached with the  Government on \nobjectives, scope, cost, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The \nTA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Informal sector workers dominate the Indian labor market and represent some 90% of \nthe total Indian workforce. India\u2019s unorganized sector is one of the largest, if not the largest, in \nthe postindustrial world. As a matter of statistical definition, the organized sector in India \naccording to the National Accounts Statistics of India comprises employment in the public sector \nand recognized educational institutions, and employment in enterprises registered under the \nIndian Factories, Bidi and Cigar Workers, Co-operative Societies and Provident Fund Acts. For \nstatistical purposes, the remainder of the workforce is classified as being in the unorganized \nsector (see table). In more generic terms, informal employment comprises both self-employment \nin informal enterprises (small or unregistered)\u2014including employers, employees, own account \noperators, and unpaid  family workers\u2014and wage-based employment undertaken without a \ntransparent employment contract in both informal and formal sector enterprises.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 March 2003. \n2  ADB. 1999.  Technical Assistance to India for Reform of Private Pension and Provident Funds System and \nEmployees\u2019 Provident Fund Organization. Manila. \n3  Although the TA was considered highly successful in facilitating the financial and operational restructuring of the \nEmployees Provident Fund Organization, more work appears needed in developing a viable policy framework for \nprivate pensions in India as the size of the private sector pensions and varying interests of different Government \nagencies involve considerable consensus building. ", "2  \nShort Profile of India\u2019s Unorganized Sector, 2000 \n \nItem  Men  Women  Total \nTotal Employment (million)  274  123  398 \nTotal Informal Employment (million)  252  118  370 \n% Employed in Agriculture  58  78  64 \n% Employed in Nonagriculture  42  22  36 \n% in Informal Enterprises  35  19  30 \n% of Nonagricultural Workers       \n    In Rural Areas      45 \n    In Urban Areas      55 \n% Share of Net Domestic Product      60 \n% Share of Nonagricultural Net Domestic Product      45 \nSource: Staff consultant report under TA 3473-IND: Development of a Secondary Market. \n \n5.  Existing old age income security schemes and life insurance products have achieved \ncoverage for only a small fraction of this group. As envisaged, the  pension schemes for the \nunorganized sector will offer coverage on a voluntary basis to India\u2019s 370 million informal sector \nworkers, including those on lower incomes. Features of the scheme include flexible contribution \narrangements in both size and frequency, reflecting the volatility of many unorganized sector \nworkers\u2019 incomes, privately managed investment funds offering the prospect of market rates of \nreturn, and a low-cost administrative environment to protect the real value of lower-income \ninvestors\u2019 contributions. Contributions will be credited to individual accounts and will be fully \nvested.  Benefits,  which  are  to  be  fully  funded,  will  be  mainly  in  the  form  of  annuities. \nEntitlements under the scheme are to be fully portable through a network of private sector \nservice providers. The Government has also stressed that the arrangements must be budget \nneutral. These initiatives provide a window for major social reform in India but will present \nsignificant challenges for the proposed pension fund regulatory and development authority \n(PFRDA) that will have the lead general management as well as regulatory role for the overall \npension system. 4  \n \n6.  A central issue is estimating the size of the potential market for the scheme. Establishing \npension  schemes  for  workers  in  the  unorganized  sector  relies  critically  on  a  working \nunderstanding of the size, composition, and dynamics of the sector. India, more than most \ndeveloping economies, has concentrated resources on developing data sets in this respect, but \nthere are still critical gaps for policy planning purposes. Critical data gaps that need to be closed \nfor this purpose are the number, location and income distribution of the unorganized sector, and \na knowledge gap concerning the attitudes and perceptions of potential contributors. \n \n7.  Closing these data gaps through specially designed surveys will be essential both for \nevaluating needs and capacities and for developing effective marketing strategies for reaching \nout to the sector. Once these data are obtained, they can be used to produce participation \ntargets by both occupational status and location. Monitoring and evaluating progress with the \nattainment of targets is a key strategic task. Without a strategic planning process in place at the \nPFRDA, adverse outcomes in attaining objectives are highly probable. \n                                                 \n4  As part of the 2003 union budget, the Government  announced two new initiatives. The first is to discontinue \nunfunded pension arrangements for new entrants to the civil service in favor of a fully funded defined contribution \nscheme with funds to be privately managed. This is being assisted by a TA from the World Bank. The second \ninitiative is to establish as soon as possible a new regulatory authority, the PFRDA to manage the new pension \narrangements. The Government  approved on 23 August 2003 the setting up of an interim PFRDA  until the \nstatutory PFRDA is established. \n ", "      3 \n8.  Available evidence indicates that greater numbers of women are in low paying informal \nsector work and consequently have lower capacities to pay pension contributions. However, \nnotwithstanding a generally lower capacity to pay, women may see a greater incentive to \nparticipate in income security schemes on offer. This situation poses some special challenges in \nlocating women who have the capacity to pay pension contributions if they are to share in the \nbenefits  of  the  new  scheme.  Further  research,  in  cooperation  with  the  nongovernment \norganization (NGO) sector, is required to develop appropriate strategies for promoting women\u2019s \nparticipation in the scheme. A summary initial poverty and social analysis report is provided in \nAppendix 2. \n \n9.  Given the breadth of the proposed reforms, the complexity of the tasks to be undertaken, \nand the extensive range of private sector players, the new PFRDA that is to implement the new \nscheme will require considerable support in, among others, (i) developing a strategic framework \nfor pension system development, (ii) developing the necessary capabilities and establishing the \nrequired systems and procedures to carry out its tasks, (iii) meeting its funding requirements \nthrough an appropriate budget, and (iv) adopting principles of good governance in  managing \nIndia\u2019s  pension  system.  A  key  task  will  be  to  scope  out  appropriate  powers,  and  define \nresponsibilities and governance requirements for the PFRDA. An enabling legislation along with \nimplementing regulations will be a crucial first step. Given the breadth and complexity of the \nresponsibilities, it will be important at an early stage to identify an optimum organizational \nstructure and staffing pattern for the PFRDA and to facilitate the strategic planning processes to \nguide its activities in rolling out the regulatory, administrative, and management requirements for \nthe new schemes. Structuring fund management and service provider agreements in line with \ninternational best practice and building capacity in the PFRDA to effectively manage those \narrangements will be required to position the PFRDA to meet the objectives of the reform. \n \n10.  Voluntary pension schemes for unorganized sector workers exist in many countries but \ntypically as a supplementary tier in a larger framework of pension provision. Planning for the \nnew scheme in India therefore takes us into somewhat uncharted waters and, if successful, \ncould be a model for other countries to consider.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA will lay the foundation for developing a pension system for the unorganized \nsector that will provide old age security to this sector that remains outside the ambit of social \nprotection  provided  to  the  formal  sector.  The  first  priority  would  be  to  gain  a  better \nunderstanding of the needs and capacities of this sector. Data gathering crucial for estimating \nthe size of the sector and determining income distribution and preferences will be key to \ndeveloping relevant products and strategies. A nationwide survey will be conducted to close this \ncritical data gap.  \n \n12.  After an evaluation of the data gathered, specific strategies and pension schemes that \naddress  the  needs  of  the  unorganized  sector  will  be  developed  including  an  appropriate \nregulatory and development framework. It will be important to conceptualize the structure, scope \nof powers and responsibilities, functions and governance requirements of the proposed PFRDA \nin parallel with the development of pension schemes for various sectors. The TA will facilitate \nthe drafting of associated legislation and appropriate pension regulations for the unorganized \nsector as well review the interface between the PFRDA and other regulators in the financial \nmarkets.  \n ", "4  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The  TA  will  aim  to  close  data  gaps  through  a  specially  designed  national  survey \nincluding attitudinal determinants, to be conducted by a domestic entity with the required \nnetwork and statistical capability to undertake the work; and develop a strategic classification of \nthe  possible  participants  from  the  unorganized  sector,  critical  to  understanding  the  size, \ncomposition, and dynamics of the sector. Through the survey and in cooperation with NGOs, \nthe TA will also identify potential women participants, their number and size and location, \ncapacity to pay, and willingness to participate in possible pension schemes. A consensus-\nbuilding meeting of stakeholders will be held to discuss the findings of the survey and agree on \nthe definition, size, classification, and description of India\u2019s unorganized sector. \n \n14.  Based on an evaluation of survey results and other data gathered and their implications, \npossible pension schemes that meet Government requirements and the identified needs of the \nunorganized sector will be developed and appropriate marketing strategies laid out to reach the \npotential target markets. The TA will also identify gaps in pension provision and services where \nsuitable Government support may be necessary, or where further research may be required.  \n \n15.  Subsequently,  the  TA  will  determine  the  most  suitable  service  providers  that  will \ncomprise the network and system through which suitable pension schemes may be offered and \nthat will facilitate participation by the target unorganized sector on a sustainable basis. \n \n16.  Finally, the TA will  design the legislative  and the regulatory framework and incentive \nstructure to promote the orderly development of the pension system for the sector. The TA will \npropose powers, responsibilities, and governance requirements of the PFRDA in line with \nunorganized sector requirements and in line with best practices. The TA will help design an \nappropriate organizational structure and  staffing for the PFRDA in line with its unorganized \nsector pension responsibilities. A 2-week study tour will be prepared for 4-6 key officials from \nMOF and the PFRDA to visit and discuss with organizations in more developed economies their \nexperience with promoting and managing private pension arrangements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent, of which $590,000 will be \nin foreign exchange, and $660,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will finance $1,000,000 \nequivalent, which comprises the entire foreign exchange cost and $410,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency cost, to be provided on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom and to \nbe  administered  by  ADB.  The  remaining  $250,000  equivalent  will  be  contributed  by  the \nGovernment and will include office accommodation, counterpart staff remuneration, and other \nlogistical support. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.   MOF\u2019s Department of Economic Affairs (Capital Markets Division) will be the Executing \nAgency (EA) for the TA and will provide necessary office space, counterpart support and other \nservices to the consultants. The EA has agreed to assign a counterpart team to implement the \nTA  and  facilitate  coordination  with  other  relevant  agencies  and  stakeholders.  The  TA  is \nexpected to begin by end January 2004 and be completed by January 2005. The consulting \nteam  will  have  three  international  consultants  (14  person-months  total)  and  two  domestic \nconsultants (8 person-months total). The domestic consultants will coordinate their work with the \ninternational consultants. An international consulting firm with wide experience and exposure in ", "      5 \npension reform, systems and pension\u2019s product development in developed and developing \ncountries will be engaged. In conducting the nationwide survey, the international consulting firm \nwill collaborate with a local firm with a network of data specialists, statisticians, and social sector \nresearch experts. In view of the specialized expertise required for the project, the international \nconsulting firm will be recruited, using simplified technical proposals under the quality-based \nselection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  engagement  of  domestic consultants.  The  terms  of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  The local firm that will do the nationwide survey in collaboration with the international \nfirm over 6 months  will submit its planned work program, distribution strategy and target \nrespondents, geographical coverage, and specific outputs within 1 week of engagement. The \nfirm will submit survey questionnaire and methodologies to be used in the survey to the EA, the \ninternational consulting firm, and ADB within 2 weeks of engagement. After securing agreement, \nthe local firm will undertake the survey. At the end of 3 months, it will submit a preliminary report \nof  its  findings  to  the  EA,  the  international  consulting  firm,  and  ADB.  Any  adjustments  or \nadditional information, or clarifications that may be required will be communicated at this point to \nthe local firm. Two weeks before the completion of services, a draft final report incorporating \nchanges that may have been required will be submitted and a workshop will be held with \nvarious stakeholders including representatives from the  EA, the international consulting firm, \nand  ADB  to  present  the  findings  of  the  survey  and  agree  on  a  common  definition  and \nclassification of the unorganized sector and its description. \n \n20.  The international consulting firm will initially provide its views on the recommendations of \nthe local firm in the conduct of the nationwide survey to ensure that the survey results provide \nthe necessary background to its own deliverables. It will prepare an inception report within 3 \nweeks of the start of its services in the field. The start of services will allow for a proper interface \nwith the local firm before the survey results and report are finalized. An interim report will be \nsubmitted at the end of the first 4 months. A workshop for representatives from the EA, other \nstakeholders, potential service providers, and ADB to agree on strategies and overall design of \nthe pension schemes, legislative provisions, implementing regulations, and process of oversight \nover the proposed pension system for the unorganized sector, as well as terms of agreements \ncovering the participants and the service providers will be held 1 month before completion of \nservices. A draft final report will be submitted to form the basis of discussions in a tripartite \nmeeting among the EA, the international consulting firm, and ADB to be held 2 weeks before the \nfinalization of the report, to consider results of discussions at the workshop and the plan for \nimplementing the pension program. The study tour (para. 16) for 4-6 key officials from  MOF \nand PFRDA for meeting with organizations in more developed economies will take place after \nthe submission of the interim report. The findings of the study tour will form part of the draft final \nreport. The draft final report will include a blueprint of the legal, regulatory, and institutional \nframework for the PFDRA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty  Sector identified as a national priority in country \nanalysis?  Yes  poverty partnership agreement? No  \n \n  Contribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in India: \n \n  India\u2019s unorganized sector is one of the largest  in the world. According to latest estimates, barely 34 million \n(or less than 11%) of the estimated working population in India are eligible for formal provisions meant to provide old \nage income security. Therefore, almost 90% of India\u2019s workforce are not eligible to participate in any scheme that \nenables them to save for economic security during their old age. Informal employment comprises both self-\nemployment in informal enterprises (small and/or unregistered) including employers, employees, own account \noperators and unpaid family workers, and wage-based employment undertaken in both informal and formal sector \nenterprises without a transparent employment contract. Many observers perceive the unorganized sector as separate \nfrom the formal sector and\u2014apart from self-employed professionals\u2014comprises workers doing marginal economic \nactivities producing low rates of reward (or remuneration) and whose most distinguishing feature is their poverty. In \nIndia\u2019s case, a considerable number of potential contributors to the proposed pension arrangements are workers in \nsmall formal sector enterprises and low-paid formal sector workers who are actively excluded from participation in the \nEmployees Provident Fund and associated schemes by virtue of these factors alone.   \n  India is yet to have a unique social security number although attempts have been initiated for contributors to \nthe  Employees  Provident  Fund.  This  together  with  the  high  costs  associated  with  implementation  makes  it  \nimpossible to have a mandatory pension scheme for all. Specifically for the unorganized sector, schemes such as the \nPublic Provident Fund Scheme have largely failed in attaining its objective of inducing savings.  \n  The envisaged pension scheme for the unorganized sector will offer coverage on a voluntary basis to India\u2019s \n370 million informal sector workers, including those on lower incomes. Features of the scheme include arrangements \nfor flexible contributions, in both size and frequency, reflecting the volatility of many unorganized sector workers\u2019 \nincomes. This would increase the rate of savings, which would lead to a higher rate of capital accumulation and \neconomic growth, crucial for a developing country like India. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Improved Governance/ Economic Development \n \n  Informal sector workers constitute a large and increasing part of the labor force and most of them are \nunwilling to contribute a significant percentage of their incomes to finance formal sector pension benefits that do not \nmeet their priority needs. Increasing coverage and motivating participation are likely under pension schemes where a \nworker can clearly see the direct relation between contributions and benefits. The voluntary pension scheme to be \nestablished for the informal sector will (i) help provide old age security for the poor, (ii) improve overall labor market \nmobility, (iii) facilitate economic growth, (iv) deepen capital markets, and (v) lead to an increase in the national \nsavings rate. It should create new opportunities for self-discipline in savings and help increase investment in human \ncapital and physical assets. \nC.  Participation Process \n \n  Stakeholder analysis: Yes. \n \n  A proposal to establish a pension scheme for workers in the unorganized sector relies critically on a working \nunderstanding of the size, composition, and dynamics of the sector. All stakeholders agree that part of the critical \npath to succeeding with the new pension scheme is to identify strategies to encourage the participation of workers. \nOff-the-shelf solutions are not available, although some countries, such as Australia, have made good progress in \nthis respect\u2014contribution model, products, and services. There are also some interesting examples worth studying of \nattempts in developing economies to effectively target informal sector workers. In both the Philippines and Malaysia, \nfor example, pension compliance and take-up strategies include linking registration processes for enterprises to \npension objectives. Interest in registering small informal sector enterprises is an emerging policy concern in many \nparts of the developing world for health and safety reasons. Operators of informal enterprises are generally positive \nabout such initiatives, which provide better levels of security from harassment and better secure their position in the \nmarketplace. Linking interest in greater regulation of the unorganized sector to pension promotional activities \ntherefore would be one strategy worth considering. Efforts to understand the attitudes of unorganized sector workers \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \n \nthrough the use of sample surveys for this purpose, so that promotional activities can be informed and well directed, \nare highly desirable, if not essential. Equally, without a good sense of the informal sector workers capacities to pay \npension contributions and at what levels, marketing efficiencies will be lost. More comprehensive and structured data \non income distributions is required. Structured data will also permit segmentation of the market and is likely to be a \nkey marker for suggesting an effective phasing approach for marketing activities. This topic will be covered in the \ndata survey proposed under the technical assistance. \nD.  Gender and Development \n \n  There is a gender imbalance in informal work in India, with a higher proportion of the female workforce than \nmale workers engaging in informal employment. In some informal work activities, women represent a majority of the \ntotal workers despite their overall lower labor force participation rates, e.g., home-based work. \n \n  Available evidence also indicates that women are more likely to be involved in low-paying work activities \nand may have a lower capacity to pay pension contributions than their male counterparts. Informal sector work for \nwomen generally, including in the Indian case, is less visible in that women are concentrated in home-based work. A \nsurvey conducted in the city of  Ahmedabad in the state of Gujarat  shows that 70% of female employment is \nundertaken at home or in the homes of others.  \n \n  This situation poses some special challenges in locating women who may have the capacity to pay pension \ncontributions and can share in the benefits of the new scheme. Among the many questions that remain unanswered \nat this point is whether female attitudes toward saving for retirement differ from those of men. Recent studies indicate \nthat women in India fall back on family support during old age, or continue to work. Given the changing social and \neconomic dynamics in India, both possibilities are likely to become increasingly problematic in the future. It may be \nthat women, notwithstanding a generally lower capacity to pay, may see a greater incentive to participate in income \nsecurity schemes on offer. \n \n  The data/attitudinal survey proposed under the technical assistance is expected to address the preceeding \nissues. \n \nE.
