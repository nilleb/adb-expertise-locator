THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Third Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns \nDevelopment Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will upgrade basic infrastructure and strengthen urban management \ncapacities to develop the towns of Mawlamyine in Mon State, and Hpa-An and Myawaddy in Kayin \nState as competitive economic nodes along the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) East\u2013West \nEconomic Corridor (EWEC).2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development of Greater Mekong Subregion corridor towns. The GMS EWEC has \ncontributed to economic growth in the region since its launch in 1998 as a GMS flagship initiative. \nThe objective of developing the GMS corridor towns is to increase economic activities along these \neconomic  corridors  by  investing  in  urban  infrastructure.  Local  economic  development  in \nMawlamyine, Hpa-An, and Myawaddy is indispensable to transform Myanmar\u2019s portion of the \nEWEC into a full-fledged economic corridor. International tourist visits increased from about \n50,000 in 2011 to 170,000 in 2016 in Mon State and from 5,000 in 2011 to 90,000 in 2016 in Kayin \nState.3 Border trade at Myawaddy in Myanmar and Mae Sot in Thailand increased from about $1 \nbillion in 2010 to $3 billion in 2016 accounting for about 12% of Myanmar\u2019s border trade.4 The \nproject will be the third phase of the GMS corridor towns development initiative and will contribute \nto environmentally sustainable and inclusive growth of the region. \n \n4.  Country\u2019s urbanization and urban issues. Although 66.0% of Myanmar\u2019s population \nresides in rural areas, the urban population has grown by 2.5% per year, faster than the country\u2019s total \npopulation (0.8% per year). The percentage of the urban population in Myanmar increased from 27.0% \nof the total population in 2000 to 34.1% of the total population in 2015. It is expected to increase to \n36.9% in 2020 and 42.8% in 2030.5 On the other hand, chronic underinvestment in urban infrastructure \nhas resulted in seriously deficient municipal services throughout Myanmar. Lack of urban infrastructure \nand limited capacity to manage municipal services are major disincentives to external investments, \nwhich are critical to socioeconomic development and growth.6 \n \n5.  Regional context. Kayin State and Mon State have significant potential for development \ndue to (i) an expected increase in trade with Thailand, (ii) better access to Yangon, (iii) its link to \nthe Bay of Bengal, (iv) expected increases in tourist visits, and (v) connection with a new \ninternational airport in Bago. Upgrading urban infrastructure and developing urban management \ncapacity are essential to strengthen Kayin and Mon states\u2019 competitiveness and tie-in with wider \neconomic growth in the GMS.  \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing the Third Greater Mekong \nSubregion Corridor Towns Development Project (TA 8756-MYA).  \n3  Directorate of Hotels and Tourism of Myanmar. 2017.

Mawlamyine is the capital of Mon State with an urban population \nof about 254,000 and has been a hub for trade with Thailand. The town\u2019s history and built heritage \nare a major attraction for tourists but the built environment is deteriorating due to improper \nmaintenance. Hpa-An is the capital of Kayin State with an urban population of about 75,000. It is \nexpected to grow as a service center along the EWEC for small industries such as textiles and \nagro-processing. The town also attracts tourists to its beautiful limestone hills and Buddhist \nheritage sites. Myawaddy borders Thailand and has an urban population of about 113,000. The \nGMS  Regional  Investment  Framework  (2013\u20132022)  identified the  border  crossing  between \nMyawaddy in Myanmar and Mae Sot in Thailand as one of the 17 key GMS border crossings.7 It \nis expected to boost cross-border trade with Thailand upon completion of the second Thailand\u2013\nMyanmar Friendship Bridge in 2019, which is supported by grant funds from the Government of \nThailand.  Development  partners  in  the  urban  sector  have  supported  mainly  Yangon  and \nMandalay, and the proposed project is the first effort to work in Myanmar\u2019s secondary cities in a \nholistic manner. \n \n7.  Core issues and binding constraints in urban service delivery. Although the state \ngovernments through town development committees are tasked with urban planning and urban \nservice delivery, they do not effectively carry out their responsibilities because they lack staff, \nskills, funds, and data. The following provides an overview of core urban services in the project \ntowns:8  \n(i)  Water supply. In Mawlamyine, 30% of the population has access to piped water \nsupply and nonrevenue water is estimated at about 80%, while in Hpa-An, only 13% \nof the population has access to piped water supply and nonrevenue water is estimated \nat  70%.  Myawaddy  has  no  public  water  supply  system  but granted  two  private \noperators the right to distribute piped water for 54% of the population. The operators\u2019 \nnetworks are extended on an ad hoc basis without any formal planning in response to \ncustomer demands. None of the existing facilities in the three project towns treats the \nwater, apart from a natural sedimentation process in Mawlamyine.  \n(ii)  Solid waste management. Only about half of the generated waste are collected in \nthe three project towns. The remaining waste is illegally dumped or burned along roads, \nnearby watercourses, and the riverfront. It not only causes environmental degradation \nbut  also  increases  damages  from  seasonal  flooding.  Waste  is  also  taken  to \nuncontrolled dump sites that are located upstream of water supply river intakes in \nMawlamyine, near major tourist attractions in Hpa-An, and along the river bordering \nwith Thailand in Myawaddy.  \n \n8.  Strategic alignment. The proposed project supports the thrusts of the GMS Strategic \nFramework  2012\u20132022  in  facilitating  cross-border  trade,  investment,  and  tourism;9 and  is \nincluded  in  the  GMS  Regional  Investment  Framework  (2013\u20132022).10 The  development  of \nsustainable cities and reduction of pollution and environmental degradation are included in the \npolicy measures to achieve the government\u2019s overarching goals toward inclusive and sustainable \neconomic development.11 The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country partnership strategy for \nMyanmar 2017\u20132021 identifies infrastructure development as a main pillar of ADB operations.12 The \nproposed project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, and the urban and \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2015.

Lessons learned. Key lessons from ongoing ADB-financed urban projects in Myanmar \nand other GMS countries, including the first phase14 and the second phase15 of the GMS corridor \ntowns development project, are that (i) creation of urban and spatial development plans was \nimportant  to  inform  sector  master  plans  and  infrastructure  project  design;  (ii)  civil  society \nparticipation  and  demand-driven  development  activities  support  local  ownership;  (iii)  a \nstreamlined  approach  to  procurement  and  contract  packaging  secures  effective  project \nimplementation;  (iv)  capacity  development  on  ADB  procedures  is  crucial  for  efficient \nimplementation; and (v) start-up assistance for the executing and implementing agencies will \naccelerate  project  implementation.  These  lessons  informed  the  project  design  and \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB added value by introducing new and innovative \napproaches to (i) conserving built heritage from the British colonial period and in traditional Mon \nstyle in Mawlamyine, and (ii) developing a joint spatial development plan for two border towns at \nthe Thailand\u2013Myanmar border. For heritage conservation, the project team prepared a knowledge \nproduct on heritage buildings in Mawlamyine as part of project preparation, and pilot renovation \nof one of the heritage buildings was included in the project. These activities are expected to help \nraise awareness on conservation and effective utilization of heritage buildings, and thereby \npromote opportunities for scale up. The joint spatial development plan will detail the future \ndevelopment strategy for the two linked towns of Mae Sot in Thailand and Myawaddy in Myanmar. \nDevelopment patterns of these two border towns will change substantially upon completion of the \nsecond Thailand\u2013Myanmar Friendship Bridge in 2019, which will bypass the urban center of both \ntowns. The plan will help inform urban management actions responding to rapid urbanization near \nand along the new bridge and access roads by controlling land use and providing urban services. \nThe plan could be a model for future GMS border area development. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: increased economic activities along the \nGMS EWEC (footnote 8). The project will have the following outcome: urban services and \ndevelopment in Mawlamyine, Hpa-An, and Myawaddy improved.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  Output 1: Urban planning improved.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n20.  Detailed feasibility assessments and preliminary designs were undertaken for the water \nsupply and solid waste management infrastructure components. The locations for project facilities \nwere selected in consultation with the KSG, MSG, and other stakeholders. The project team \nanalyzed alternative technical options for each project facility and identified the optimum design \nsolutions. In reviewing the alternatives, the project team considered the improvement of the \noverall efficiency of capital investment and operational expenditure, the use of appropriate \ntechnology within operating agencies, and the reduction of negative social and environmental \nimpacts. The project will provide training to ensure the sustainable operation and maintenance of \nproject facilities. \n \n21.  The Khin Pon Chong dam in Mawlamyine, which was built in 1904, will be rehabilitated to \nadapt to the climate change impacts. The rehabilitation will reduce seepage losses during the dry \nseason and reservoir overflows during the monsoon season, thus the dam will be operated year-\nround, even considering detrimental changes of rainfall and temperature patterns in the future.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis assesses the economic viability of the project \nthrough standard cost\u2013benefit analysis.19 The analysis is undertaken separately for each of the \nwater supply and solid waste management components in each project town as well as for the \nbuilt-heritage conservation component in Mawlamyine. Since most of the project benefits cannot \nbe valued within traditional measures, they are assessed in terms of willingness to pay for the \n                                                \n18 Provided that DUHD will negotiate and sign the consulting service contract. \n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nimproved services based on the contingent valuation survey for the water supply and solid waste \nmanagement components.

The economic analysis indicates that the overall project has an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13.1% and an economic net present value of MK1.13 \nbillion. The EIRRs of water supply are 17.6% in Mawlamyine, 3.0% in Hpa-An, and 14.8% in \nMyawaddy. The EIRRs of solid waste are 13.0% in Mawlamyine, 15.9% in Hpa-An, and 18.7% in \nMyawaddy. The heritage component has an EIRR of 35.5%. The high poverty rate in Hpa-An,20 \nvery low coverage of piped water supply,21 current availability of free river and spring water, lack \nof awareness of water quality, and unsanitary hygiene are the factors justifying the low willingness \nto pay for better water supply, which is needed as a basic service. \n \n23.  Financial analysis. The government will make the funds available to MSG and KSG. To \nenhance the sustainability of the water supply and solid waste management investments, KSG \nand MSG will prepare a tariff road map at the start of project implementation. The water tariff road \nmap and solid waste tariff roadmap will be implemented for each project town prior to full \noperation, with regular tariff increases to ensure that operational costs are fully covered, while \nensuring affordability by low-income households. If the towns do not have sufficient funds to cover \noperation expenditures, the union government and the states will jointly undertake to balance \neach town\u2019s budget through increased financial support.22 \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  The risk  rating for financial  management  is  high. The  public financial  management \nsystems in Myanmar are relatively weak because of insufficient capacity and computerization. \nThe major risks are (i) limited capacity of the executing and implementing agencies to (a) conduct \nproject financial management, (b) prepare financial management reports, and (c) implement an \ninternal audit; and (ii) weak financial management system controls. The proposed risk mitigation \nmeasures involve (i) application of the direct payment procedure for all payments without using \nan imprest account; (ii) provision of training for the project management offices (PMOs) on ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement policies and procedures, and international best practices; and (iii) improvement of \nproject budgeting and accounting systems, including computerization. \n \n25.  The procurement risk is rated high. The executing and implementing agencies do not have \nexperience in implementing externally funded infrastructure development projects. To mitigate \nprocurement risks (i) the number of contracts was reduced to a minimum; (ii) international \ncompetitive bidding will be used for most procurement packages; (iii) DUHD has requested ADB \nto assist in selecting the project implementation support consultant,23 provided that DUHD will \nnegotiate and sign the consulting service contract; and (iv) ample training on ADB\u2019s procurement \nrequirements will be conducted under the project. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained and discussed \nwith the government and DUHD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \n                                                \n20 Based on the results of the contingent valuation survey and a per capita income of $1.25/day as the poverty line, the poverty \nincidence is estimated at 65.1% for Mawlamyine, at 65.4% for Hpa-An, and at 60.1% for Myawaddy.  \n21 The results of the 2014 Household Census for Myanmar indicate that only 1.9% of urban residents of Hpa-An had access to piped \ntap water for drinking and 12.9% had access to piped tap water for other purposes; this compares with 23.1% access to piped tap \nwater for drinking and 53.5% access to piped tap water for other purposes for Myawaddy, and 9.2% access to piped tap water for \ndrinking and 29.7% access to piped tap water for other purposes for Mawlamyine. \n22 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 This contract includes procurement expert inputs. \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n27.  The primary beneficiaries of the three project towns are the residents along selected \ncorridors. They will benefit from the improved water system and better solid waste management, \nwhich  is  anticipated  to  yield  health  and  economic  gains.  The  stakeholder  strategy  and \nparticipation plan for the project will maximize the participation of stakeholders\u2014particularly \nwomen, the poor, and vulnerable groups\u2014by raising awareness of the project. As the project is \nin former conflict areas, PMOs will implement a detailed communication strategy to inform all \nstakeholders of project progress and ensure meaningful dialogue throughout the implementation \nperiod.24 The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. PMOs will implement and \nmonitor the gender equality and social inclusion action plan at regular intervals to ensure that \nwomen, the poor, and the vulnerable are included and involved in the project.25 PMOs will collect \nsex-disaggregated data and social and economic background information within a year to help \nestablish baseline figures to track social and gender equality results as the project progresses. \nThe project will establish pro-poor affordability measures through a system of deferred payments \nfor water connection as well as block water-use tariffs with the best rates available for those \nconsuming less. The project will also modernize urban planning and management by building the \ncapacity for community consultation and engagement, which will improve the communication flow \nand trust between the government and residents. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.26 In compliance with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation \nrequirements, the safeguard documents for environment and involuntary resettlements have been \nposted on ADB\u2019s website in April 2017. \n \n29.  Environment  (category  B).  The  project  team  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) for both Kayin State and Mon State, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and the applicable environment regulations of the government.27 The project is \nnot expected to cause irreversible adverse environmental impacts. Environmental impacts will be \npredominantly positive; any negative impacts will be due to nuisances during construction. IEEs \nhave identified impacts and mitigations with particular attention to (i) occupational health and \nsafety in construction and operations, (ii) design of landfill sites to prevent leachate migration, and \n(iii) closure of the existing dump sites. The IEEs also prioritized the environment, health, and \nsecurity issue in terms of (i) capacity building for the PMOs and project implementation unit, (ii) \ndetailed  specifications  in  tender  documents,  and  (iii)  inspection  and  supervision  during \nconstruction. The project team recommended the integration of the potential impacts of climate \nchange and natural hazards into the detailed engineering design. At the detailed engineering \ndesign stage, PMOs will update and finalize the environmental management plans (EMPs). \nEstimated costs to implement the EMPs were integrated into the project costs. The final EMPs, \ncleared  by  ADB,  will  form  part  of  the  bidding  documents.  PMOs  will  ensure  effective \nenvironmental monitoring at all stages of subproject implementation. From March to October \n2016, the project team conducted meaningful stakeholder consultations through meetings, key \ninformant interviews, focused group discussions, and public consultations. The IEE also describes \nthe grievance redress mechanism for the project. \n                                                \n24 The community strategy is included in the PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB.

Involuntary resettlement (category B). In Kayin State, a total area of 24.79 hectares (ha) \nwill be acquired and three households (17 persons) will be affected. The solid waste management \nsubproject  will  have  impacts  on  25  waste-picker  households  (119  persons)  that  will  be \neconomically displaced, of which one household (four persons) requires relocation. In Mon State, \na total area of 19.82 ha will be acquired and two households (10 persons) will be affected. The \nsolid  waste  management  subprojects  will  have  impacts  on  10  waste-picker  households \n(40 persons) that will be economically displaced. All other impacts in both Kayin and Mon states \nare  partial  and  temporary.  The  project  team  has  established  a  cutoff  date  with  extensive \nstakeholder consultation and participation. Counterpart funds will finance an estimated $485,105 \nfor  the  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  income restoration  program. The  project team \nprepared two resettlement plans for Kayin State and Mon State. The resettlement plans comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and consider relevant provisions of local laws and \nregulations. ADB will clear the resettlement plans at appraisal and the updated resettlement plans \nat the detailed engineering design. KSG and MSG have disclosed project information during \nproject preparation, and PMOs will update and distribute a project information booklet during a \ndetailed measurement survey. PMOs will ensure effective monitoring and public consultation with \nall  stakeholders  and  affected  people  at  all  stages  of  project  implementation.  Stakeholder \nconsultations will continue through formal and informal focus group discussions. KSG and MSG \ninformed the affected people that a grievance redress mechanism will be established to help \nfacilitate resolution of complaints regarding project performance. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The population in the project area consists of Bamar \n(55.2%) followed by Kayin (15.7%) and Mon (11.3%). However, no communities of ethnic \nminorities or groups live separately in the urban area. As the project will benefit all residents \nequally, no adverse impact on indigenous peoples is anticipated. In accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, no separate indigenous peoples\u2019 plans are required. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n32.
