THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan, \nwithout government guarantee to Nam Ngum 3 Power Company (NN3PC) for the Nam Ngum 3 \nHydropower Project consisting of: (i) tranche 1 of up to $200 million; and (ii) tranche 2 of up to \n$150 million in respect of which, the risk of nonpayment by NN3PC will be assumed by financial \ninstitutions acceptable to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under an unfunded risk participation \narrangement.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  The hydropower potential in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is extensive, with an \nestimated potential of 30,000 megawatts (MW). However, this potential is unevenly distributed \namong the GMS countries.1 For example, Thailand, which has a large and growing domestic \npower requirement, has limited hydropower potential and is highly dependent on natural gas for \nfuel which is projected to deplete over time. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), on \nthe other hand, has the largest hydropower potential in the region at 18,000 MW, but the smallest \ndomestic  power  requirements.  The  GMS  member  countries  have  agreed  to  promote  the \ndevelopment and trading of energy to enable member countries to access cost-efficient energy \nresources. \n  \n3.  The  Lao  PDR  is  considered  a  least  developed  country  (LDC),  with  a  gross  domestic \nproduct per capita of $890 in 2009.2 The Government of the Lao PDR aims to take the country out \nof the LDC category by 2020. The power sector is critical to achieving this goal, because it is a vital \nsource of export earnings that generated close to 30% of total export receipts in 2008. Today only \n2,530 MW (14% of the estimated hydropower capacity) has been harnessed. The government\u2019s \ntarget is to have some 16,000 MW of installed hydropower capacity by 2020, of which up to 7,000 \nMW will be exported to Thailand, and 5,000 MW to Viet Nam. However, the government does not \nhave the resources to raise the substantial financing required to build these projects and would \nneed  to  mobilize  financing  from  the  private  sector  through  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP) \narrangements, with the government holding minority stakes in these projects. \n \n4.  ADB support for infrastructure development PPPs has included the construction of Theun \nHinboun in 19943 and Nam Theun 2 (NT2) in 2005.4 The government has determined that the Nam \nNgum 3 Hydropower Project should be financed through PPP arrangements using the build-own-\noperate-transfer  mechanism.  When  completed,  the  project  would  be  among  the  largest \nhydropower plants in the Lao PDR. Given the amount of financing required, the sponsors of \nNN3PC have requested ADB to provide financial assistance and take a prominent role in arranging \nlong-term financing. As an equity shareholder, the Government of the Lao PDR has also requested \nADB to consider supporting the financing required for their investment into the project. ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n1  The GMS countries are Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. \n2 ADB.  2009.

Manila. ", "2         \n            \n \nsovereign and nonsovereign operations have collaborated on this project since 2006. ADB has \nalso been asked to lead the environment and social due diligence to ensure that the project will be \ndeveloped  and  operated  in  a  sustainable  manner  and  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). As part of its leadership role, ADB provided a technical assistance package in \n2007 to conduct a cumulative impact assessment of the Nam Ngum River Basin (NNRB), which \nwas completed in 2010.5  \n  \n5.  NN3PC  has  been  in  lengthy  negotiations  with  the  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of \nThailand (EGAT) for the sale of power to Thailand. The negotiations were completed in March \n2010 with the signing of a memorandum of understanding. The project was subsequently included \nin Thailand\u2019s 2010 power development plan as an important source of additional electricity to meet \nThailand\u2019s power requirements by 2017.  \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n6.  The project is located along the Nam Ngum River (NNR) in Vientiane and Xieng Khouang \nprovinces and forms a cascade with other hydropower projects in the NNRB.6 It will operate as a \nstorage system with a maximum storage capacity of 1,407 million cubic meters. Water will pass \nthrough a 10.6 kilometer (km)-long headrace tunnel to an underground power station. A nearly 1 \nkm-long tailrace tunnel would carry the water back to the river. The main features of the project \ninclude (i) 2 x 220 MW installed capacity; (ii) a concrete-faced rockfill dam, 220 meters (m) in \nheight; and (iii) a 100 km long, 500 kV transmission line.  \n \n7.  The project will connect to an existing substation in Nabong where transmission lines from \nother power export projects7 will also be linked. Currently, only a 230 kilovolt (kV) switchyard exists \nat the Nabong substation, which is used solely by Nam Ngum 2 Power Company (NN2). This \nswitchyard will need to be upgraded to a 230/500 kV collector substation to be able to serve both \nthe project and NN2. Power from the Nabong substation will then pass through a 27 km-long 500 \nkV double circuit transmission line that will connect to the delivery point in Thailand. The line was \nfinanced and constructed by NN2 and is fully operational, but is currently only energized at 230 kV. \nNN2 currently owns the line. \n \n8.  The government is required under their concession agreement with NN3PC to (i) expand \nthe existing Nabong substation to enable the project to connect to it, and (ii) own and operate both \nthe Nabong substation and the common transmission line. At the government\u2019s request, ADB\u2019s \nsovereign operations is considering supporting the financing required by the Government of the \nLao PDR to meet its obligations to NN3PC under the concession agreement. ADB financed project \npreparatory technical assistance to prepare the Nabong Udon Thani Transmission Line in 2009.8  \n \n3.  The Borrower/ Sponsor \n \n9.  NN3PC,  a  special-purpose  Lao  PDR  incorporated  company,  was  established  by  a \nconsortium consisting of the Axia Power Holdings (Axia), the Ratchaburi Electricity Generating \nHolding Public Company (Ratch), the GMS Lao Company (GMS Lao), and the Lao Holding State \n                                                \n5 ADB. 2007.

The final report was completed in December 2010.  \n6  A total of 14 hydropower projects are expected to be located in the Nam Ngum River Basin.  \n7 It is envisaged that the Nabong substation and the common transmission line will be used by the following hydropower \nprojects: Nam Ngum 2, Nam Ngum 3, Nam Ngiep 1, and Nam Theun 1. Nam Ngum 2 was commissioned in 2011. \nNam Ngiep 1 is under development while the status of Nam Theun 1 is unclear. \n8 ADB. 2007.

Axia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Marubeni Corporation (Marubeni). Established in 2003, \nAxia currently owns 16 power generating assets globally with a combined generating capacity of \n2,493  MW.  Marubeni  is  one  of  the  largest  Japanese  companies,  with  a  diversified  business \nportfolio. Marubeni has a strong presence in the global power market, having been involved in the \ndevelopment of 33 power projects in 22 countries, with a combined gross generating capacity of \n23,604 MW.  \n \n11.  Ratch  is  Thailand\u2019s  second-largest  electricity  generator  and  the  country\u2019s  largest \nindependent power producer with a market share of about 14.2% of Thailand\u2019s total generating \ncapacity  (as  of  March  2011).  The  company  was  founded  in  March  2000,  and  currently  has \ninvestments in several commercial operating power plants with a stand-alone production capacity \nof 3,645 MW. Ratch is listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand. However, EGAT owns and \ncontrols about 45% of the equity.  \n \n12.  GMS Lao is a wholly owned subsidiary of GMS Power Public Company Limited (GMS \nPower). GMS Power is one of Thailand\u2019s leading private power developers. It is part of the \nconsortium that developed, owns and operates the 210 MW Theun-Hinboun Hydropower Plant in \nthe Lao PDR and the lead sponsor for the Bang Bo 350 MW combined cycle power plant in \nThailand.9 GMS Power is currently spearheading the construction of the 280 MW Theun-Hinboun \nexpansion.  \n \n13.  LHSE is the holding company specifically established by the Government of the Lao PDR to \nown and manage its equity investments in various power projects. ADB\u2019s sovereign operation is \nconsidering the financing of LHSE\u2019s equity in NN3PC. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n1.  Impact \n \n14.  Promote private sector investment. The project, which has been developed under a PPP \narrangement, will largely be financed through private sector equity and commercial debt. The \nsuccess of this project will further increase the flow of private sector funds into infrastructure \ndevelopment in the Lao PDR. Roughly 10 PPP projects, including this one, are expected to be \nimplemented over a 10-year period beginning in 2011. \n \n15.  Improve energy security in Thailand. Thailand is one of the largest electricity consumers \nin Southeast Asia.  As of December 2009, installed power generation capacity was 29,212 MW, \n71%  of  which  is  natural  gas.  The  Government  of  Thailand  has  stressed  the  importance  of \ndiversifying its energy sources and securing alternative sources of fuel for power generation to \nensure energy security that would sustain their economic growth.  The goal is to reduce power \ngeneration from natural gas to about 50% by 2030, and increase power imports to about 25% of \nthe system\u2019s power supply requirements. The project will achieve this objective by providing an \nalternative, low cost and renewable energy source. \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n16.  The  project's  outcome  is  increased  regional  cooperation  between  the  Lao  PDR  and \nThailand through the trade of clean energy. The Lao PDR has limited opportunities for trade and \n                                                \n9 The Bang Bo power plant has been recently recognized for setting a world record of continuous operating performance. \nThe facility also has an outstanding health, safety and environmental record. \n ", "4         \n            \n \neconomic growth. However, it has a very large hydropower potential that can be harnessed to \ngenerate  foreign  currency  receipts.  Thailand,  on  the  other  hand,  has  a  strong  and  growing \neconomy, but this growth may be at risk due to its heavy reliance on its dwindling sources of \nnatural gas. This project is an example of an economic partnership in the region that addresses the \ndevelopment constraints of both countries through the trade of electricity.  \n \n17.  The Government of Thailand has developed a plan to cut down greenhouse gas emissions \nbecause of increasing concerns regarding the environmental impact of power generation.10 The \nplan calls for the increase in the portion of renewable energy in power generation to 2.4% by year \n2020. Through the project, up to 2,072 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean energy will be sold to \nThailand  which  will  help  Thailand  avoid  about  1.0  million  tons  per  year  of  carbon  dioxide \nemissions. \n \n3.  Outputs \n \n18.  The output will be the construction of a 440 MW hydropower plant in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguards Policy Statement. The project will demonstrate that large infrastructure projects can be \ndeveloped in a sustainable manner while providing economic benefits to the country.  \n \n19.  The project will spur economic growth in the Lao PDR by increasing government revenues, \nemployment generation and the provision of community infrastructure. It will generate about $771 \nmillion in revenues for socioeconomic development and provide employment opportunities during \nthe  construction  and  operation  phase  for  the  Lao  PDR  nationals.  Moreover,  the  project  will \nconstruct community infrastructure (i.e., schools, health centers and improved roads) that will \nfacilitate economic and social activities. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020  \n \n20.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,11 which  identifies  infrastructure \ndevelopment and regional cooperation as two of the five core areas of operation. Under Strategy \n2020,  ADB\u2019s  infrastructure  operations  will  promote  a  larger  role  for  the  private  sector  in \ninfrastructure financing. ADB will also scale up its support for regional cooperation by increasingly \ninvesting in projects that accelerate growth and economic partnerships in the region.  \n2.  Consistency with Regional Strategy \n \n21.  The regional cooperation operations business plan (2010\u20132012) for GMS12 aims to achieve \nan integrated and prosperous region through the promotion of economic growth, environmental \nsustainability and private sector development. This project will demonstrate the economic benefits \nthat  will  accrue  to  both  countries  as  a  result  of  the  trading  of  power.  It  also  promotes  the \ndevelopment of large-scale infrastructure in the region with significant debt and equity coming from \nprivate  sector  institutions  based  in  other  regions.  Project  implementation  will  meet  high \nenvironmental and social standards. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n10 Roughly 50% of Thailand\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to power generation. \n11 ADB. 2008.

Regional Cooperation Operations Business Plan: Greater Mekong Subregion, 2010-2012. Manila. ", "5 \n \n3.  Consistency with Country Strategy \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) 2007-2011 for the Lao PDR13 is focused on \npromoting pro-poor sustainable growth. This project mobilizes large-scale private sector investment \ninto the Lao PDR which will (i) generate employment opportunities for the Lao PDR nationals, (ii) \nimprove the skills of the workforce; and (iii) provide community infrastructure, all of which will have \neconomic multiplier effects. At the end of the concession period, the project will be turned over to \nthe government at no cost. The project will continue to generate income for the country for at least \nanother 25 years after the turnover. \n4.  Consistency with Sector Strategy  \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Energy Policy14 requires energy operations to be aligned with ADB's overall strategy, \nwith one emphasis being on energy security. The project is consistent with the policy as it would \ndiversify  Thailand\u2019s  power  supply.15 Having  a  diversified  energy  source  will  help  ensure  that \nThailand\u2019s economic growth will not be derailed by energy supply shortages or price volatility. \n5.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n \n24.  A key finding from ADB\u2019s independent review of the Lao PDR power sector program in \n201016 indicates the government lacks the capacity to identify and manage environmental and \nsocial impacts. Further interventions to increase the government\u2019s capacity are recommended, \nincluding  through  continued  financial  assistance  by  ADB  for  the  development  of  hydropower \nprojects to ensure proper environmental and social safeguards are adopted. These would include \nincorporating  lessons  learned  from  the  NT2  experience  such  as  (i)  an  improved  stakeholder \nconsultation and grievance mechanism; (ii) the early implementation of the livelihood restoration \nprograms; and (iii) the establishment of realistic targets that take into account the affected peoples\u2019 \ncapacity to assimilate new practices. \n \nD.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n26.  ADB will provide a (i) direct loan in the amount of up to $200 million, and (ii)  a second \ntranche, in the amount of up to $150 million. ADB will enter into an unfunded risk participation \nagreement for the full amount of the second tranche with eligible commercial banks. Both tranches \nwill carry an interest rate as well as commitment and front-end fees to be determined by ADB\u2019s \nInvestment  Committee.  Both  tranches  will  finance  only  eligible  project  costs  under  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n27.  In addition to assistance from ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations, ADB is also considering a \nloan to the Government of the Lao PDR in the amount of up to $115.1 million to finance LHSE\u2019s \nequity investment in the project. The sovereign loan will be considered separately by management \nand will follow the approval process for ADB\u2019s sovereign loan proposals.  \nB.  Value-Added by ADB Assistance \n28.  The nature of the project (i.e., long construction period, high upfront capital expenditure, \ncompetitive tariffs, long asset life and revenue contracts) is appropriately financed by long-tenor \ndebt to match its cash flow profile. The proposed long-tenor debt from ADB plays a crucial role in \nensuring the economic and financial viability of the project.  \n \n29.  The development of hydropower resources as an export commodity is a critical component \nof the Government of the Lao PDR\u2019s strategy to achieve its poverty reduction goal. A substantial \namount of financing from the private sector is required to build these projects. However, the private \nsector  continues  to  perceive  inherent  risks  in  supporting  these  types  of  projects  without  the \ninvolvement of development financial institutions, such as ADB. They find confidence to co-invest \nalongside ADB because the project will be financed in a structurally sound manner and will comply \nwith high environmental and social standards.  \n \n ", "7 \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n30.  The project is classified category A for environment, for involuntary resettlement, and for \nindigenous people under the Safeguard Policy Statement. The potential environmental and social \nimpacts and risks of the project and its associated facilities were identified and assessed in the \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  prepared  by  NN3PC  and  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  14 \nJanuary 2011.17 NN3PC will undertake an updated comprehensive biodiversity study on project \nareas commencing in the last quarter of 2011 to reconfirm the extent of conservation and offset \nprograms. An independent advisory panel, to be financed by ADB, will be constituted to assist the \ngovernment evaluate the impacts on biodiversity, assess the adequacy of recommended measures \nand implement an effective biodiversity offset programs to achieve a no net loss of biodiversity. \nMeasures to address the social impacts of the project are described in the draft resettlement and \nethnic minority development plan (REMDP) which has been initially posted on ADB\u2019s website on 6 \nJune  2011.18 Broad  community  support  for  the  project  has  been  provided  by  Khmu  ethnic \ncommunity living in Ban Xiengdet that will be directly affected by the Project. Such support is \ndocumented in meeting agreements and household level consent to relocate forms authenticated \nby village leaders. Effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts, and to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social protection requirements, are incorporated in \nthe various social plans in the REMDP. The institutional capacity and commitment of NN3PC to \nmanage the project\u2019s environmental and social risks are deemed adequate,19 while collaboration \nwith the NNRB Committee is considered crucial in managing cumulative impacts at the river basin \nlevel. Information disclosure and consultations have been and will be conducted in accordance \nwith ADB requirements.  \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n31.  NN3PC has been advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date), and \nits  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practices  relating  to  the  combating  of  money \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the project documentation includes \nappropriate anti-corruption provisions and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance.  \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n32.  The proposed direct loan is within ADB\u2019s approved medium-term, country, industry, single \nobligor, and group exposure limits for nonsovereign operations.  \nD.  Assurances \n33.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),20 \nthe Government of the Lao PDR will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the \nproposed  assistance  to  Nam  Ngum  3  Power  Company.
