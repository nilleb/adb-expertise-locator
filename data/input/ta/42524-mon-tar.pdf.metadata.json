INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  has  made  significant  efforts  to  develop  information \ncommunication technology (ICT). In 2004 it established the Information and Communication \nTechnology Agency (ICTA) under the direct auspices of the prime minister as the lead agency \nfor ICT policies, coordination, and implementation. Mongolia's Parliament has endorsed the ICT \nVision-2010  which  aims  to  build  up  a  citizen-centered,  result-oriented,  and  market-based \ngovernment by utilizing ICT through (i) back office development (record keeping, inventory, \nhuman resource management, finance and accounting, and budgetary works), (ii) front office \ndevelopment (providing services online), and (iii) tools to create more transparent government. \nWith  the  assistance  of  the  Government  of  Korea,  the  ICTA  is  constructing  a  government \ninformation data center. The center is expected to be completed in September 2009 and be \nconnected with all government agencies and ministries by 2010. The ICT revolution is affecting \nall sectors of the economy in Mongolia and enabling new and improved business processes to \nbe used for the delivery of products and services. Currently all aimags and sums1 have internet \naccess and cellular network coverage. There are eight communication service providers.  \n \n2.  The Government has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance \n(TA) to upgrade the existing road database by applying a geographic information system (GIS). \nAfter a reconnaissance mission in November 2008, the Government of the Republic of Korea \nindicated  its  agreement  to  finance  the  TA  in  February  2009.  This  report  is  based  on  the \nunderstandings reached with the Government of Mongolia during the TA Fact-Finding Mission \nfielded in March 2009 on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services for the TA,2 and the \nmission's observations in the field. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.     \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The demand for transport infrastructure in Mongolia has been increasing. Over the past \ndecade great emphasis has been placed on expansion of the road network in the country. The \ncurrent road network comprises 49,250 kilometers (km) of which 11,218 km are national roads. \nAs of the end of 2008, there was 2,600 km of national paved roads. The growing road network \nrequires proper maintenance to sustain the asset base, and there is a significant need to \nimprove Mongolia's road asset management system. A sound road asset management system \nrequires (i) a sufficiently detailed road database for planning and budgeting of maintenance \nworks, (ii) a system for identifying and prioritizing maintenance works, and (iii) a system for \noptimal allocation of the given funds. Sound maintenance planning is a necessary condition for \nperformance-based maintenance contracts and concessions that eventually increase private \nsector participation in the road sector and improve the quality of maintenance works.  \n \n4.  The existing road database, developed in 2004 by the Government, stores data on the \nroad inventory and limited data on national road conditions in the form of a Microsoft Excel \nspreadsheet.  This  database  was  not  designed  as  a  tool  for  maintenance  planning  and \nbudgeting. Due to the type of database software, updating of data often takes a long time, and \nthe database does not provide information on ongoing road works and road closures. As the \ndatabase is not accessible to road users, travelers have no opportunity to use it to be informed \nin advance about road conditions.   \n \n                                                 \n1  An aimag is equivalent to a province; a sum is a local administrative subdivision within an aimag.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 January 2009.  \n ", "2   \n5.  Road condition data acquisition equipment for assessing and/or measuring road surface \nroughness, pavement structure, and skid resistance was purchased during 1999\u20132002 under a \nWorld Bank-financed project. The Government started a road condition survey to assess and \nmonitor the changes in road asset value in 2001, and completed data collection on 46.3% of the \nnational road network. The Government also introduced a new process to utilize road condition \ndata acquisition equipment for assessing the quality of newly built roads before opening them to \nthe public. The Government has found this approach useful for evaluating the performance of \ncontractors while expanding the road database by inputting the new data. However, most road \ncondition data acquisition equipment is outdated and data collection has therefore fallen behind \nin recent years. \n \n6.  ICT has been recognized as an excellent way to improve the accuracy of information in \nthe existing database and to disseminate road information to road users. Thus, the Government \nwishes to upgrade the existing database through the application of a GIS so that it can provide \naccurate information for sound maintenance planning and budgeting. It also aims to make the \nroad information in the database accessible to road users through the internet. However, due to \nlack of funds and expertise, little progress has been made.  \n \n7.  Mongolia's deteriorated roads are contributing to unsafe, inefficient, and uncomfortable \ntravel. The proposed TA aims to assist the Government in addressing the issue by improving its \nroad asset management system. The TA will (i) upgrade the existing database through the \napplication of a GIS, (ii) initiate the process of sound maintenance planning and budgeting \nthrough demonstration of pilot activities on national paved roads, and (iii) enable a new e-\nservice to road users by establishing a web server in Mongolia. The Government understands \nthe importance of sustainability of the upgraded database and the data center and web server \nand is committed to provide adequate human and financial resources for their maintenance and \noperation.  \n \n8.  ADB has been a key external development partner for the Mongolian transport sector. In \n2008, the Independent Evaluation Department evaluated ADB's sector assistance program in \nMongolia over the period 1993\u20132007. The assessment concluded that ADB's support for the \nroad sector was successful, and suggested giving more attention to strengthening the road \nmaintenance regime. Such recommendations are reflected in the forms of the proposed TA on \naddressing the need to improve road maintenance planning and budgeting. It is envisaged that \nfuture ADB support will build on the outputs of this TA to (i) monitor and appraise the effective \nuse of the improved database, and (ii) help the Government to improve the three dimensions of \nthe maintenance regime\u2014planning, funding, and execution. The proposed TA is consistent with \n(i) Mongolia's development priorities for improving public asset inventory through promoting ICT \nas a tool to create more transparent government; and (ii) ADB\u2019s strategy which focuses on \nassistance to institutional strengthening, and efficient delivery of public services.3  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved road maintenance management in Mongolia. The \noutcome of the TA will be an improved road asset management system.  \n \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia 2009\u20132012. Manila (still under preparation). \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The  output  of  the  TA  will  be  (i)  a  GIS-based  road  database  providing  real-time \ninformation about road conditions to the Government and road users, (ii) a data center and web \nserver, and (iii) a policy note and technical papers for strengthening the institutional capacity of \nthe Department of Roads (DOR) for road asset management.  \n \n11.  Upgrading the Existing Road Database. The TA will upgrade the existing database in \nfour stages: (i) preparation stage (assess the quality of the current database, identify additional \ninformation, and identify entities between which data flows to determine the database format), \n(ii) field survey stage (collect additional data and information on about 11,200 km of national \nroads and road condition data on about 2,600 km of national paved roads); (iii) desk work stage \n(customize the software purchased under the TA to meet the database requirement, calibration \nof the survey outputs, and input the data into the database); and (iv) quality control (monitor \noperation of the database and take corrective actions as needed). \n \n12.  Establishing a Data Center and Web Server. Under the TA, hardware, software, and \nother  equipment  necessary  for  a  data  center/web  server  will  be  procured,  and  system \narchitecture  for  a  data  center/web  server  to  exchange  data  and  information  between  the \ngovernment  agencies  and  the  users  will  be  developed.  It  is  expected  that  the  road  data \ncenter/web server will be located in the Government Information Data Center and be maintained \nby the Government.  \n \n13.  Strengthening Institutional Capacity. Under the TA, strengthening of the institutional \ncapacity of the DOR for road asset management through (i) producing various technical papers \non routine and periodic maintenance, (ii) introducing a road condition survey on a pilot basis, \nand (iii) preparing a medium-term plan on maintenance works for the national paved roads, will \noccur. Operating policies and procedures of the database and the data center and web server, \nas well as a policy note on deployment of intelligent transport systems in the country, will be \ndeveloped under the TA. As broader and collective support is required from the stakeholders\u2014\nState  Property  Committee  (the  owner  of  the  road  network);  Ministry  of  Roads,  Transport, \nConstruction  and  Urban  Development  (MRTCUD);  Ministry  of  Finance;  DOR;  ICTA;  and \ncommunication  service  providers\u2014for  developing  and  maintaining  a  database  and  a  data \ncenter/web  server,  a  management  structure  and  partnership  arrangements  to  ensure \nsustainability will be formulated. Under the TA, focus group discussions, stakeholder meetings, \nneed assessment workshop, and a training program on the asset management system and the \nuse and maintaining of the database and the data center/web server will be conducted. It is \nexpected  that  students  of  the  Road  Faculty  of  the  Mongolian  University  of  Science  and \nTechnology will be involved in undertaking pilot activities such as conducting the road condition \nsurvey, calibrating the survey outputs, inputting the data into the database, and preparing a \nmedium-term maintenance plan for national paved roads. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which the Government has requested ADB \nfinancing of $500,000 (Appendix 2), which will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of \nKorea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance \nequivalent to $100,000 in kind by providing counterpart staff, office facilities, and other support \nservices required in implementing the TA.  \n \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The MRTCUD will be the executing agency, and the DOR will be the implementing \nagency. A project steering committee has been established under the MRTCUD. Its members \ninclude a project coordinator; government officials from the Ministry of Finance, MRTCUD, ICTA; \nand the Administration of Land Affairs, Geodetic and Cartography. It will discuss and resolve \nissues that arise during TA implementation and oversee progress. The DOR has appointed a \nproject  coordinator  to  (i)  supervise  day-to-day  activities  of  the  consultants,  (ii)  assist  the \nconsultants  in  undertaking  their  services  by  providing  information  and  data,  (iii)  arrange \nmeetings and workshops, (iv) liaise with the project steering committee and various government \nagencies and organizations, and (v) report activities to ADB and the Government.  \n \n16.  The  TA  will  require  42.5  person-months  of  consulting  services  (4.5  person-months \ninternational and 38 person-months national) to carry out the work as defined in the terms of \nreference in Appendix 3. ADB will engage a national consulting firm using biodata technical \nproposal procedures and the quality and cost-based selection method based on the standard \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20; and two individual international consultants using the individual \nconsultant selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The international maintenance expert (3 person-months) \nwill have expertise in GIS-based road database management and road asset management \nsystems, and the international information technology expert (1.5 person-months) will have \nexpertise in the development of system architecture and intelligent transport systems.  \n \n17.  The international maintenance expert's services will be provided in two stages. In the \nbeginning  of  the  TA  the  expert  will  be  fielded  at  least  a  month  earlier  then  the  national \nconsultants to (i) design the road database system, (ii) develop specifications for hardware and \nsoftware and road condition data acquisition equipment, (iii) help the national consultants in \nprocuring equipment, (iv) procure database software, (v) prepare guidelines for carrying out field \nsurveys and measuring road conditions, and (vi) outline institutional improvements for the road \nasset management system. In a later stage the expert will (i) help the national consultants in \ncalibrating database software and the survey outputs, and inputting the data into the database; \nand  (ii)  monitor  operation  of  the  database  and  take  corrective  actions  as  needed.  The \ninternational  information  technology  expert's  input  is  required  for  a  continuous  period  of \n1.5 months; the expert will also start his or her services ahead of the national consultants to \nundertake the tasks described in the terms of reference. At the end of their services the experts \nwill  produce  short  reports  and  organize  workshops  to  discuss  their  findings  and \nrecommendations with the project steering committee. A national consulting firm will undertake \nfield surveys, customize software, upgrade the database, and establish a data center and web \nserver.  \n \n18.  The TA will finance the procurement of road condition data acquisition equipment (about \n$47,000), software for the database (about $80,000), hardware for the data center and web \nserver  and  other  equipment  (about  $17,000),  and  office  equipment  (about  $5,000).  The \nequipment, except for the database software, is expected to be procured through the shopping \nprocedure. As off-the-shelf software is readily available and obtainable from limited sources, \nand taking into consideration procurement efficacy and efficiency, it is anticipated that the GIS-\nbased software for the database will be procured through the single source selection method. \nThe consultants will procure hardware, software, and equipment in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and will turn them over to the \nDOR after completion of the TA.  \n \n ", "  5\n19.  The  proposed  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  14-month  period,  with  expected \ncommencement in mid-June 2009 and completion by August 2010. ADB approved advance \ncontracting on 28 April 2009; this includes posting the consultant selection recruitment notice, \nshort-listing,  and  requesting  and  evaluating  proposals.  The  advance  contracting  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \n20.  The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with  ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.4  \n \n21.  As the TA will promote an innovative development initiative with the potential for future \nreplication, it will be important to closely evaluate the performance of the project and gather \nuseful lessons learned during implementation. In this regard, the expected outputs and outcome \nwill be monitored by ADB review missions and reports to be produced during implementation. \nThe technical papers for improving road asset management and policy note are expected to be \ndisseminated through workshops, seminars, and ADB knowledge products.   \n \n22.  As defined in the terms of reference, the international and national consultants will \nprepare  reports  on  their  activities  and  submit  them  to  ADB  and  the  Government.  The \ninternational consultants will prepare short reports on their activities at the end of the services. \nThe national consultants will submit an inception report within 1 month after the TA starts, \nmonthly reports within 2 weeks of the following months, an interim report within 6 months after \nthe TA starts, a draft final report within 13 months after the TA starts, and a final report within \n14 months after the TA starts. The final report should attach all documents produced by both the \ninternational  and  national  consultants  under  the  TA:  (i)  the  various  technical  papers  for \nimproving the road asset management system, (ii) a medium-term plan for maintenance of the \nnational  paved  roads,  (iii)  a  policy  note  for  deploying  an  intelligent  transport  system, \n(iv) manuals and procedures for operating and maintaining of the database and the data center \nand  web  server,  and  (v)  reports  on  the  training  and  workshops  organized  during  TA \nimplementation including training programs, handouts, and lists of attendances.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund for the Road Database Development Using Geographic Information System, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB 2008.Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.
