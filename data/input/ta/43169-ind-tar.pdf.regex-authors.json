INTRODUCTION \n1.  During stakeholder consultations and programming discussions with the Government of \nIndia (GOI) in January 2009, it became clear that ADB should strengthen the environmental \nfocus of its India assistance program. Accordingly, the loan and technical assistance (TA) \nprogram was designed to support GOI's efforts in the areas of adaptation and mitigation. \nSupport for the National Action Plan on Climate Change (SNAPCC) is one such TA Project \nincluded at the request of the Government  \n \n2.  Since March 2009, ADB consultations in India on developing the South Asia Regional \nDepartment  climate  change  implementation  plan  were  held  with  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources (MOWR), reputed climate change experts, and development partners. Consultation \nhas continued with the government. This TA has been developed following a request from the \nDepartment of Economic Affairs on behalf of MOWR for ADB to assist the preparation of \nspecific  studies  that  would  help  operationalize  the  National  Water  Mission  (NWM)  of  the \nNational Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).1 Several meetings have been held with the \ngovernment,  during  which  possible  approaches  to  support  the  NWM  were  discussed  and \nrefined. A meeting was held with the MOWR and representatives from a number of water \nagencies from the central and state governments on 28 October 2009. At the meeting, a \nsuggested approach to the support program was presented and discussed, useful comments \nand suggestions were made, and these have been incorporated into the TA report. Preliminary \nunderstandings and agreements have been reached on TA impact, outcome, implementation \narrangements,  cost  estimates,  and  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.2  The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Adapting to climate variability and change has long been part of water planning and \nmanagement, but the current pace of climate change is unprecedented, so experience to date is \nunlikely to be sufficient to guide an acceptable way forward. While climate change predictions \non a global or regional scale are quite robust, large uncertainties remain in projections of climate \nchange  impacts  on  hydrology  at  the  basin  level.  Water  resource  managers  and  planners \nurgently need information and direction to plan the way forward.  \n \n4.  India's position on climate change issues and government response.3 India is and \nwill  continue  to  be  severely  affected  by  climate  variability  while  confronted  with  huge \ndevelopment imperatives. For India, the focus of climate change action cannot just be emissions \nbut must equally address adaptation. India is already subject to high climate variability, resulting \nin droughts, floods, and other extreme weather. In an address to the National Conference of \nMinisters  of  Environment  and  Forests  on  August  2009,  Prime  Minister  Manmohan  Singh \nencouraged state governments to create action plans on climate change consistent with the \nstrategies  of  the  NAPCC.  The  government's  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan,  2007\u20132012  clearly \narticulates the impacts and implications of climate change noted in Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change assessment reports. To meaningfully address some of the threats of climate \nchange,  the  government  unveiled  on  30  June  2008  its  NAPCC.  The  NAPCC  proposes \n                                                 \n1 The request was received on the 9 October 2009.  \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 20 May 2009. \n3 Prime Minister\u2019s Office. 2009. The Road to Copenhagen: India's Position on Climate Change Issues. Public \nDiplomacy Division, Ministry of External Affairs. http://www.meaindia.nic.in \n ", "2   \nestablishing eight national missions,4 each to be managed by ministries and line agencies \nthrough inter-sectoral groups including related ministries; the Ministry of Finance; the Planning \nCommission, and experts from industry, academia, and civil society. Each mission is preparing \ndetailed implementation plans under the 11th and 12th (2010-2017) plans. \n \n5.  India's  hydro-climatic  future. India is highly vulnerable to climate change. Current \npressures  on  water  resources  are  extremely  challenging,  as  variations  and  extremes  of \nhydrology combine with population growth and poverty. To adapt to anticipated climate change, \nit is essential to coordinate water management practices and optimize the operation of water \ninfrastructure consistent with sustainable development and the availability of water. The NWM \nhas identified a wide range of issues and possible responses, from which three major areas of \nconcern stand out: (i) alterations of winter snow pack dynamics on snow-fed river systems, (ii) \nbasins where groundwater is major water source, and (iii) coastal areas where sea level rise will \naffect surface water and groundwater.  \n \n6.  Opportunities for Asian Development Bank support. In its request for assistance, the \nMOWR identified three areas of possible support: (i) integrated water resources management \n(IWRM)  studies  on  selected  river  basins  or  sub-basins;  (ii)  strategic  programs  for  pilot \ndemonstration of improved water-use efficiency, and (iii) strengthening institutional strategies \nand capacity, including support from international experts for identified areas of climate change \nresearch and support for community mobilization and awareness. Supplementary Appendix 2 \npresents an analysis of the linkages between the NWM and SNAPCC activities and output.  \n \n7.  Linkages with development planning. The 11th Plan recognizes the urgent need to \nbalance the trade off  between economic growth and environmental protection, considering \npressures posed by India's large population, economic growth, and ever-increasing demand on \nnatural resources including water. The environmental orientation of ADB\u2019s assistance for both \nadaptation and mitigation has therefore been strengthened to support 11th plan priorities. The \nTA is therefore particularly significant, as it will support operationalizing the NWM established \nunder NAPCC. The NWM is a critical requirement for adaptation and will enable the MOWR to \nplay a strategic role over the longer term in building capacity in other ministries and state line \nagencies to manage planning for climate change adaptation effectively in their sectors.5 This TA \ncomplements other TA and loan projects being processed by ADB and will place ADB in a \nunique position among development partners in terms of assisting India's efforts in climate \nchange adaptation. The TA outputs will contribute directly to states\u2019 development of climate \nchange action plans, which is a high priority for the government. \n \n8.  Integrated water resource management. IWRM is an effective tool for delivering water \nservices better by coordinating and balancing various water users. When applied strategically, \nthe approach can enhance water security and adaptation to water-related risks. Successful \nIWRM under climate change requires integrating the management of supply and demand and \ndeveloping strong links among research, monitoring, and management. National and state \ngovernments will require considerable support to meet these challenges. The NWM clearly \nidentifies IWRM at the basin level as the foundation upon which the implementation of climate \nchange adaptation and impact assessments can be realized. In parallel with IWRM, individual \n                                                 \n4  These are the (i) National Solar Mission, (ii) National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency, (iii) National Mission \non Sustainable Habitat, (iv) National Water Mission, (v) National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem, \n(vi) National Mission for a Green India, (vii) National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture, and (viii) National Mission \non Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change. \n5  The TA has been developed with flexibility so that aspects of the implementation plan of the NWM may be \naccommodated once it is finalized. \n ", "        3\n \nwater sectors must independently move forward to achieve significantly more effective and \nsustainable management. Each sector should develop targets through the IWRM program, as \nimproving  efficiency  in  water  sectors  is  fundamental  to  climate  change  adaptation.  The \napplication of river basin organizations may be considered if deemed appropriate. \n \n9.  Guidance  in  decision  making  under  uncertainty.  Uncertainty  in  climate  change \nscenarios and the limitations of simulations degrade the value of historical data in guiding water \nresource decisions. Although understanding of the impacts of climate change continues to \nimprove, it is still difficult to predict regional impacts with precision. This uncertainty is a major \nconstraint on formulating and implementing adaptation policies. Simulating projected climate \nchange scenarios and assessing the sensitivity of basin water resources to these changes may \nform  the  basis  of  a  step-by-step  progression  from  general  to  more  specific  and  accurate \nassessments to support the design of cost-effective adaptation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced resilience to climate change affecting vulnerable \nsectors and populations though strategic support to India\u2019s NAPCC. The outcome of the TA will \nbe a preliminary IWRM approach to climate adaptation supported by government. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The main outputs of the TA are described below6.  \n \n12.   Preparing strategic frameworks for IWRM to address climate uncertainty. The TA \nwill undertake studies in up to three pilot basins or sub-basins to develop strategy frameworks \nfor addressing current and likely future scenarios of climate change. Framework planning will \nbuild on the proposals of the NWM and international best practices and address how climate \nuncertainties can be incorporated into mainstream planning. The studies will review national and \ninternational projections of climate parameters, identify data gaps, and assess the viability of \napplying them to support decision making. Framework planning will be applied to identify key \nissues affecting surface water, groundwater, related water sectors, and the environment. The \nplans will set out broad strategies and programs to make water systems more robust and \nresilient  against  climate  change  uncertainty,  while  meeting  rising  water  demand  and \nenvironmental requirements. Pilot basins will be selected by type and likely degree of sensitivity \nto  climate  change.  Basin  selection  should  incorporate  three  major  areas  of  concern:  (i) \nalterations of winter snow pack dynamics from climate change, (ii) basins or sub-basins where \ngroundwater is major water source, and (iii) coastal areas where sea level rise will have impacts \non surface water and groundwater.  \n \n13.   Assessing the potential for improving water-use efficiency. Through the work in the \npilot  sub-basins,  the  TA  will  examine  intervention  requirements,  scope,  and  strategies  to \nimprove the efficiency of water systems and study how improved efficiency may be applied to \nclimate  change  adaptation.  Studies  may  include  (i)  options  for  improving  management \norganizations to address poor service delivery and cost recovery; (ii) the conjunctive use of \nsurface water and groundwater; (iii) the potential for structural improvements including water \n                                                 \n6 The TA scope, though falling within the general confines of the components outlined here, will be further refined in \nthe course of implementation through consultation with the executing agency and based on priorities of the \ngovernment. \n ", "4   \nreuse and improved distribution systems; (iv) a review of water-allocation systems and the \npotential for volumetric water allocation and establishing effective regulation and control; (v) \nalternative  and  appropriate  arrangements  to  initiate  and  develop  sustainable  change  and \nstrategies for scaling up, including private sector participation or other management initiatives; \n(vi) assessing legal frameworks and mandates; and (vii) identifying appropriate indicators and \nmonitoring.  \n \n14.   Road map for effective institutions, specialist training, and awareness. The TA will \nprovide technical, institutional, and other expertise to identify requirements for establishing \neffective IWRM systems under likely climate change scenarios. This will include preparing \npreliminary IWRM climate change adaptation road maps for states based on consultations with \nstate governments and supported by outputs of investigations in the selected pilot sub-basins. A \npreliminary climate change adaptation roadmap will be prepared for the MOWR incorporating \nthe broad proposals for effective and integrated management, addressing national and state \nneeds. Information in the road maps will include (i) issues derived from state information and \nconsultation  and  from  the  outputs  of  strategic  framework  planning  for  the  sub-basins;  (ii) \nassessment  of  sector  responsibilities  and  effective  institutional  arrangements  for  managing \nwater resources and sectoral coordination; (iii) outline proposals for appropriate institutions to \naddress issues such as water control, regulation, tariffs, and allocations; (iv) institutional and \ncontrol strategies to manage and control groundwater and surface water usage for ensuring \ncompliance  with  environmental  regulations;  (iv)  identifying  new  management  initiatives  to \naddress likely climate change effects, including the potential involvement of the private sector in \nresearch, planning design, management, and investment; and (v) assessing current and future \nrequirements for research related to climate change and the links to planning and managing \nwater resources. The TA will prepare specialist training modules, with training materials for \ninformation,  education,  and  communications  modified  for  the  Indian  context.  International \nclimate experts will give presentations on climate and hydrological topics. Workshops will be \nheld on key issues and include invitations to international and national speakers to create better \nunderstanding of climate change and promote links. \n \n15.  To supplement the preliminary findings of the TA, it is proposed that selected national \ninstitutes undertake various parallel studies.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA (Appendix 2) is estimated to cost $925,000 equivalent, of which $750,000  will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund 7.  The Government, through MOWR, \nwill finance the remaining $175,000 equivalent by providing office space, transport, counterpart \nstaff, data analysis and other administrative costs. The Government would also provide funds \nfor parallel studies by National Institutes and the costs of dissemination and broadcasting of \nawareness materials.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The MOWR will be the executing agency and appoint a senior technical director and/or \nnational coordinator. An interdepartmental project working group will be established to help \ndirect and support the programming of activities. It will be chaired by the project technical \ndirector and include representatives from the MOWR, Central Water Commission, Planning \nCommission, related ministries, representatives of the pilot basin states, and selected sector \n                                                 \n7 ADB-(2008).

In parallel, a senior steering committee will be established to provide guidance, \ndirection on policy, and support for endorsing the study findings. It will be chaired by the \nsecretary of the MOWR and include senior representatives from other ministries including the \nMinistry of Finance and specialists in related areas. Studies in the pilot basins will be supported \nthrough state project directors and working groups.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented in three phases over 12 months tentatively planned from \nApril 2010 to March 2011. Phases 1 and 2 to be completed over the first 7 months and develop \nthe IWRM basin framework studies, state road maps, and other studies. Over the subsequent 5 \nmonths, phase 3 of the TA will support applying the outputs from the pilot basin studies to \ndevelop  a  national  IWRM  road  map,  training,  workshops,  consultations,  and  information \ndissemination on related activities. All equipment for the TA will be procured according to ADB \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  A  team  of  international \nconsultants will be engaged for 13 person-months, and national consultants for 25 person-\nmonths, to implement the TA. A total of 13 experts will be engaged in accordance with ADB \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Given  the \nspecialized nature of the work and ADB\u2019s recent entry into the climate change arena in India, \nthis  TA  will  require  more  specialized  management.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  recruit  all \nconsultants individually in consultation with the government. This will provide the best mix of \nconsultants with the most appropriate qualifications and experience. Outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Appendix 3. TA progress will be measured as stipulated in the design \nand monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The TA outputs will be disseminated in state and \nnational workshops and through local capacity-building and training workshops. Disbursements \nunder the TA will be made in accordance with the ADB Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook8.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for Support for the National Action Plan on Climate Change, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n8 ADB.2008 Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.

Scope of Services \n \n2.  Part  A:  preliminary  sub-basin  strategic  framework  plans  for  three  sub-basins. \nStrategic framework planning studies will be implemented in up to three pilot basins or sub-basins. \nThese will be IWRM studies with a focus on developing preliminary strategies for addressing \npresent uncertainty regarding climate change and likely greater future uncertainty. Framework \nplanning will build on the proposals by National Water Mission (NWM) and international best \npractices and address IWRM issues and how climate change uncertainty can be incorporated into \nplanning. The studies will review national and international projections of climate parameters, \nidentify  data  gaps,  and  assess  the  viability  of  applying  them  to  support  decision  making. \nFramework planning will be applied to identify key issues regarding surface water, groundwater, \nrelated water sectors, and the environment. The plans will set out broad strategies and programs \nto make water systems more robust against climate change uncertainty and meet rising water \ndemand and environmental requirements. Up to three pilot basins will be selected by type and \nlikely degree of sensitivity to climate change, and they should be at a workable scale. Basin \nselection should incorporate three major areas of concern: (i) alterations of winter snow pack \ndynamics from climate change; (ii) basins or sub-basins where groundwater is major water source, \nand (iii) coastal areas where sea level rise will affect surface water and groundwater. The outputs \nwill be a strategic plan for each of the three sub-basins with common annexes where appropriate.  \n3.  The main activities will be to (i) prepare broad technical assessments of key water issues in \nthe sub-basins; (ii) assess data management systems and river basin models where they exist; (iii) \ndevelop a basic geographic information system (GIS) to assemble spatial data for preliminary \n ", "              Appendix 3  11 \nplanning; (iv) work with stakeholders at the state and sub-basin level to identify a strategic vision \nand objectives for IWRM and possible adaptation measures to meet climate change uncertainties; \n(v) identify institutional enhancements and possible investment projects to achieve the vision and \nobjectives; and (vi) identify possible management and investment scenarios to meet the long-term \nneed for efficiency, improved service delivery, and cost recovery, including the potential roles of \ngovernment, stakeholders, and the private sector.  \n \n4.  Part B: water efficiency improvement assessment. Through the work in the pilot sub-\nbasins,  the  TA  will  examine  intervention  requirements,  scope,  and  strategies  to  improve  the \nefficiency  of  water  systems  and  study  how  climate  change  dimensions  may  effectively  be \nincorporated. Studies will include (i) options for improving management organizations, building on \nexisting  structures  but  addressing  urgent  needs  to  address  poor  service  delivery  and  cost \nrecovery; (ii) the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater; (iii) the potential for structural \nimprovements including water reuse and improved distribution systems; (iv) a review of water-\nallocation systems and the potential for volumetric water allocation supported by establishing \neffective  regulation  and  controls;  (v)  alternative  and  appropriate  arrangements  to  initiate  and \ndevelop sustainable change and strategies for scaling up, including the provision of private sector \nor other appropriate management support initiatives; (vi) assessing legal frameworks or mandates; \nand (vii) identifying appropriate indicators and monitoring frameworks.  \n5.  Part C:  preliminary state IWRM climate change adaptation road map. Preliminary and \noutline IWRM climate change adaptation roadmaps will be prepared for the states where the pilot \nsub-basins  are  located.  The  state  IWRM  roadmaps  will  identify  the  broad  requirements  for \nestablishing  effective  IWRM  systems  under  climate  change.  Information  in  the  roadmaps  will \ninclude (i) broad water issues in the state, incorporating the experiences from pilot sub-basins; (ii) \nassessment of requisite functions and sector responsibilities at different levels and broad proposals \nfor effective institutional arrangements for water resources management and sectoral coordination; \n(iii)  outline  proposals  for  appropriate  institutions  to  address  such  issues  as  water  control, \nregulation, tariffs, and allocations; (iv) identifying institutional and control strategies to manage and \ncontrol groundwater and surface water use, ensuring requirements for a healthy environment; (v) \nidentifying new management initiatives to meet the scale and necessary speed of change required \nto adapt to likely climate effects, including the application of private sector support for research, \nplanning design, management, and investment; (vi) assessing ongoing research and broad future \nrequirements for research related to climate change and the links to water resources planning and \nmanagement.  State  working  groups  will  be  key  forums  for  interaction  and  preparing  state \nroadmaps. \n6.  Part D: preliminary IWRM climate change adaptation roadmap for MOWR addressing \nnational and state needs. By applying the outputs from the three state road maps, together with \nparallel ADB-supported programs and other state and national experiences,1  a preliminary IWRM \nclimate change adaptation road map will be prepared for the MOWR for effective and integrated \nmanagement by states and the center. The road map will identify the broad national and state \nneeds to implement IWRM and delineate responsibilities for data management, including proposals \nfor  integrated  data  management;  data  sharing  initiatives;  and  possibly  setting  up  river  basin \norganizations. Scale, scope, resources, and time frames will be defined to effectively meet the \nchallenges of IWRM and climate change adaptation.  \n7.  Part E:  IWRM training modules, awareness kits, and specialist training. The TA will \nprepare specialist training modules in key areas. Training material will draw on parallel ADB \nprograms for information, education, and communications and other climate and IWRM information \n                                                 \n1 The ADB-supported IWRM and service delivery TA in Karnataka will be of special relevance. \n ", "12       Appendix 3 \nsources, with material modified for the Indian situation. International climate experts will give \npresentations on climate and hydrological topics.
