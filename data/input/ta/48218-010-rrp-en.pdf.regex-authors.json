THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan (PBL) to Nepal for the Food Safety and Agriculture Commercialization Program. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting the Food Safety and \nAgriculture Commercialization Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The program will provide budget support for reforms to (i) improve food safety and quality \nmonitoring systems that will reduce transaction time and costs for exporters, and protect public \nhealth by preventing unsafe food consumption; (ii) promote agricultural commercialization to \nsupport farmers in their transition from subsistence farming to profit-making production and sales; \nand (iii) strengthen institutional capacity, particularly at the subnational government level, given \nthe devolved nature of agriculture. The program will also support Nepal\u2019s agriculture sector with \nregard to policy and regulatory amendments in the transition from a unitary to federal structure. \nThe program is consistent with Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for \nNepal, 2013\u20132017.1 The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, specifically the operational \npriorities on (i) accelerating progress in gender equality (operational priority 2), (ii) promoting rural \ndevelopment and food security (operational priority 5), and (iii) strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity (operational priority 6). \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Nepal has undergone many years of political turmoil, including an armed conflict that \nended in 2006. The country also suffered a destructive earthquake in 2015, but is now on a path \nto political stability and economic recovery. However, Nepal remains one of the poorest countries \nin Asia\u2014in FY2018, gross domestic product per capita was $993.9, and an estimated 18.7%2 of \nthe population lived in poverty, mostly in rural areas. Agriculture still relies mostly on subsistence \nfarming. Of the working age population (above 15 years), 55% are engaged in subsistence \nagriculture, of whom 61% are women.3 Less than 10% of farm holdings produce exclusively to \nsell and are small-scale due to increasingly fragmented land ownership structure. The agriculture \nsector contributed 27.0% of GDP in 2019 and annual growth in agriculture sector gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) at constant prices has increased from 0.2% in FY2016 to an average of 4.3% \nduring FY2017\u2013FY2019 as a result of a favorable monsoon and resulting large harvests in \nFY2017 and FY2019; this has also contributed to subdued food price inflation.  \n \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2012.

At the request of the government, this sector \ndevelopment program has been separated into two loans: a PBL and an investment project. \n2  The actual poverty rate will be available after the new National Living Standard Survey is completed in 2020. The last \nsurvey was completed in 2011 which reported 25.2% of the population living below the national poverty line. \n3  Government of Nepal, Central Bureau of Statistics. 2019. Report on the Nepal Labour Force Survey, 2017/18. \nKathmandu; and Central Bureau of Statistics. 2019. National Accounts 2018/19. Kathmandu. Men are mostly \nemployed in construction, manufacturing, and transport services, while women are mostly employed in agriculture, \nforestry, and fishing\u2014supporting the claim that Nepal\u2019s agriculture sector is largely dependent on women\u2019s labor. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  Low agriculture productivity. Despite Nepal\u2019s recent agricultural growth, agricultural \nproductivity remains the lowest in South Asia.4 For example, cereal yield was 2,796 kilograms \n(kg) per hectare (ha) in 2017, compared with 4,411 kg/ha in Bangladesh and 3,371 kg/ha in \nBhutan.5 The key structural constraints of Nepal\u2019s agriculture and food distribution system that \nsuppress its productivity include (i) the dominance of subsistence farming, (ii) poor adoption of \nsuitable on-farm and post-harvest technology; (iii) the lack of timely supply of quality inputs such \nas fertilizer, feeds, and seeds; and (iv) limited financial services and infrastructure, such as \nirrigation  and  roads.  Gender  barriers  also  prevent  women  and  marginalized  groups  from \naccessing resources and opportunities to improve agricultural productivity.6 While quality seeds \nalone can increase agricultural production by 15%\u201320%, most farmers in Nepal use locally \navailable seeds retained from previous cropping seasons because of poor penetration of formal \nseed markets in rural areas, inadequate seed multiplication, and the lower cost of locally available \nseeds, resulting in less than 10% of farmers currently purchasing seeds for major cereal crops.7 \nThe  public  sector  dominates  in  seed  multiplication  of  cereal  crops,  although  private  seed \ncompanies also produce seeds and are increasingly involved in vegetable seed multiplication.8 \nThe amendment of the Seed Act and the standard-setting for seed testing are critical steps in \ncreating an enabling policy environment to protect farmers and encourage the private sector to \nengage in seed multiplication, distribution, and collaborative variety development. \n \n5.  Low levels of agricultural commercialization. Agribusiness in Nepal is diverse and \ninvolved in poultry, dairy, spices, fruits, tea, ginger, cardamom, coffee, and honey, among other \ncommodities. It is dominated by millions of small landholdings and many thousands of small \nagribusinesses and traders. Given the limited arable land per capita, fragmented and small-scale \nagribusinesses cannot leverage the advantages of scale. Lessons from recent ADB projects in \nNepal suggest policies and regulatory reforms that facilitate better land use planning, land \nconsolidation, and contract farming to allow the agriculture and food system to respond effectively \nto increasing market demand. Commercialization is further constrained by the limited capacity of \nfarmers to prepare bankable business proposals to seek formal financing (footnote 6). By \naddressing some of these key constraints, the program will create synergies with other agriculture \nfinancing and value chain initiatives being financed by ADB and other key development partners \nand support subsequent investment projects planned by ADB to support the agriculture sector.9 \n \n6.  Weak food quality testing and monitoring system is impeding exports. Meeting the \nfood quality standards of destination markets is the fundamental requirement for increased export \n \n4  A 34-year study (1980\u20132013) revealed that Nepal experienced the lowest agricultural productivity growth rate in \nSouth Asia (0.06%, compared with 1.05% in Bangladesh, 0.52% in India, and 0.38% in Pakistan).

Despite its membership in the World Trade Organization, Nepal has not \nbeen able to adopt all international standards on sanitary and phytosanitary measures because \nof inadequate resources.10 The National Food and Feed Reference Laboratory at Kathmandu is \nthe only laboratory in Nepal with international accreditation. These limitations hamper smooth \nmovement of agricultural commodities between Nepal and India, which is a major trading partner. \nExporters face significant delays and higher transaction costs because they are subject to multiple \ntests on both sides of the border. As a result, despite agriculture sector growth, imports among \nthe top traded agricultural products are growing strongly (up 85% from NRs107 billion in FY2013 \nto NRs198 billion in FY2018), while exports have remained relatively flat, growing only 11% during \nthe same period (from NRs20.5 billion in FY2013 to NRs22.7 billion in FY2018).11 \n \n7.  Food safety and quality is an emerging domestic issue. Food safety is a concern in \nterms of consumer health, farmer safety (as users of hazardous inputs), and the potential for \nagricultural commercialization. Toxic residues in vegetable samples from Nepal exceeded the \nthresholds permitted by the European Union by a factor of 4 for eggplants, 17 for tomatoes, and \n49 for chilis.12 In view of the growing concern on food safety, the Government of Nepal is \nattempting to (i) establish national safety standards and a system to test and assess against \nIndian  standards;  (ii)  introduce  a  surveillance  system  (including  sanitary  and  phytosanitary \nstandards, systemic inspection, and sampling); and (iii) regulate the distribution and use of \nhazardous  inputs  (through  border  control;  registration  and  licensing  of  distributors;  proper \nlabeling; and education of farmers, distributors, and local regulators). The United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  (USAID)  and  World  Bank-funded  projects  are  helping  build \ngovernment capacity, but further reform of the laws and regulations regulating the production, \nsale and management of pesticides, and establishment of a monitoring system, particularly at the \nprovincial level, are needed in Nepal. \n \n8.  Transition from unitary to federal structure of government. In 2015, a new constitution \nwas promulgated to establish Nepal as a federal state with three levels of government\u2014federal, \nprovincial, and local\u2014that are empowered to enact laws, prepare budgets, and mobilize their own \nresources. Mandates pertaining to agriculture and allied sectors have been largely delegated to \nthe  provincial  and  local  governments,  increasing  their  decision-making  powers  and \nresponsibilities for effective delivery of public goods and services. However, there are overlaps in \nthe functioning of agriculture sector authorities at the three levels of the government: (i) Ministry \nof Agriculture and Livestock Development (MOALD) at the federal level; (ii) Ministry of Land \nManagement, Agriculture, and Cooperatives (MOLMAC) in the provinces; and (iii) local level.13 \nThe absence of clear procedures and standards associated with the devolution, and the lack of \ntechnical and human resource capacity of the nascent provincial and local governments present \nacute challenges for agriculture sector performance. Previously adopted national policies and the \nADB-assisted Agricultural Development Strategy (ADS) need to be adapted to the subnational \n \n10 As a member of the World Trade Organization, Nepal is bound to enforce sanitary and phytosanitary measures \nbased on the standards, guidelines, and recommendations of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, International \nAnimal Health Organization, and International Plant Protection Convention. \n11 In FY2018, India accounted for 57.4% of Nepal\u2019s exports and 65.3% of imports.

The system of intergovernmental fiscal transfers from federal \nto subnational governments is still evolving.15 \n \n9.  Government\u2019s reform agenda. The government\u2019s 14th periodic plan (FY2017\u2013FY2019), \n15th  five-year  plan  (FY2020\u2012FY2024),  and  Envisioning  Nepal  2030  have  highlighted \nmodernization and commercialization of the agriculture sector as a national development priority \nin light of the need to reduce dependence on imports, and Nepal\u2019s aspiration to attain middle-\nincome status by 2030.16 Together with other development partners, ADB has supported the \ngovernment in formulating the ADS, a strategic sector development vision through 2035, which \nserves as a basis for ongoing policy dialogues, roadmap development, and sector investments \nby development partners such as the USAID and the World Bank. The proposed PBL will support \nthe policy reforms required for food safety (ADS output 4) and agricultural commercialization (ADS \noutput 3 supported by ADS output 2) envisioned by the ADS. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n10.  Policy reform. A two-tranche, stand-alone PBL is proposed. The first tranche, to be \nreleased on loan effectiveness, includes fundamental policy framework reforms. There are nine \nfirst tranche policy actions which have all been achieved. The second tranche has 12 policy \nactions, which will further build on the first tranche actions to introduce regulations, strengthen \ninstitutional mechanisms, build capacity of key stakeholders, and strengthen food safety and \nquality systems targeted at both the domestic and export markets.18 The following reform areas \nare envisaged: \n(i)  Reform Area 1: Food safety and quality monitoring systems improved.19 An \nimportant factor impeding food exports is the regulatory and institutional capacity \nwithin Nepal for sanitary and phytosanitary monitoring. The program will support \nthe government in completing all prerequisites for International Organization for \nStandardization/International  Electrotechnical  Commission  (ISO/IEC)  17025 \ninternational accreditation for at least one additional pesticide group testing unit at \nthe National Food and Feed Reference Laboratory.20 In parallel, and to provide \n \n14 ADB. 2013.

The federal government budget \nallocation for agriculture, forestry, and fisheries for FY2020 is NRs79.8 billion, equivalent to 5.2% of the total federal \nbudget allocation; NRs12.1 billion (15.2%) is allocated to the provinces, and NRs1.7 billion (2.1%) to local \ngovernments. \n16 Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission. 2016.

Manila. \n18 A two-tranche program has the advantage of sequencing policy actions over time, allowing for deeper policy dialogue \nengagement and provision of capacity development support. Nepal\u2019s recent performance in implementing stand-\nalone, multitranche PBLs has been satisfactory, e.g., ADB. 2017. Completion Report for Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal: \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Trade Facilitation Program. Manila. \n19 Policy actions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are tranche 1 conditionalities and policy actions 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are \ntranche 2 conditionalities related to reform area 1. Details are in the Policy Matrix (Appendix 4). \n20 ISO/IEC 17025 is the main ISO standard used by testing and calibration laboratories; most laboratories must hold \naccreditation to this standard to be deemed technically competent. At least one unit among pyrethroid and carbamate \npesticide group testing units in the National Food and Feed Reference Laboratory will be considered for certification. \n \n ", "5 \nobjective standards for pesticide residue levels for all fruits and vegetables, the \nprogram aims to notify the maximum pesticide residue levels (MRLs) for 20 fruits \nand vegetables after following due procedure, including inviting objections, if any, \nfrom  trading  partner  countries  on  the  World  Trade  Organization  Notification \nSubmission  System.  In  livestock  management,  the  program  will  support  two \nvaccine production units in the National Vaccine Production Laboratory, and one \nmolecular unit in the Central Animal and Poultry Disease Investigation Laboratory \nto  meet  the  prerequisites  for  ISO/IEC  17025  accreditation.  International \naccreditation of these production laboratories will enable export of vaccines for \ndiseases such as Peste des Petits Ruminants, and Newcastle. Among the policy \nand  regulatory  interventions  for safe  domestic production, the  new  Pesticide \nManagement Bill 2018 submitted to the Parliament for approval will replace the old \nPesticide Management Act 1991\u2014to further expand the definition of pesticides; \nregulate their production, sale, storage, and transportation; and ensure effective \nsurveillance to discourage the overuse of harmful chemicals by farmers\u2014which \nwill be backed by a pesticide management regulation.21 The program will develop \ntest  protocols  and  surveillance  plans  for  two  vegetables,  and  conduct  pilot \npesticide residue tests based on these protocols for demonstration. A national \nFood  Safety  Policy  approved  by  the  Cabinet  for  further  submission  to  the \nParliament, and a national Food Safety and Quality Bill submitted by MOALD for \nlegal consent, will provide a comprehensive framework for food safety and quality \nto encourage the national food industry to align the food quality certification system \nwith international food safety standards, and promote food exports.  \n \n(ii)  Reform  Area  2:  Agricultural  commercialization  promoted.22 Models  that \nencourage land pooling without ownership transfer can improve economies of \nscale  and  profitability,  and  thereby  encourage  agricultural  commercialization. \nImproved market infrastructure is also essential, and arguably the most important \nrequirement for commercialization. Taking note of these aspects, the Agribusiness \nPromotion Bill 2018, submitted to the Cabinet for approval, focuses on land \nmanagement, contract farming, and agriculture marketing. On improving access \nto finance, the program takes note of a key lesson from ADB projects that farmers\u2019 \nlack of capacity to prepare business proposals for bank financing limits rural \noutreach of banks despite agriculture sector lending targets. To this effect, the \nprogram will support the Gandaki Province MOLMAC (Gandaki MOLMAC) in \npreparing sample business plans for at least two high-value commodities,23 and \nposting these on its website for public access.24 Farmers\u2019 access to expensive \nfarm machinery can be improved by promoting custom hiring centers that can \n \n21 Synopses of the Proposed Amendments in Policies and Acts (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n22 Policy actions 6, 7, and 8 are tranche 1 conditionalities and policy actions 17, 18, and 19 are tranche 2 conditionalities \nrelated to reform area 2. Details are in the Policy Matrix (Appendix 4). \n23 Gandaki Province has been selected based on its readiness to work on the ADB PBL, among the three provinces \nthe government requested ADB to focus on (the others are provinces 1 and 5). The farming system in the Terai has \na greater degree of mechanization than the hill region, but is largely cereal-based, while the hill region provides the \npotential for expanding production of high-value crops. Off-season vegetable, fruit, and coffee production has scope \nfor further growth. Gandaki Province is a tourist hub and located close to Kathmandu, and thus a good area in which \nto seek to increase the demand for safer food supplies. \n24 Broadband penetration in Nepal is currently 64.5% (Nepal Telecommunications Authority. 2019. MIS Report Jestha, \n2076 [15 May 2019\u201315 June 2019]. Kathmandu), and therefore posting on the website should be effective. It will be \ncomplemented with dissemination through ADS-Joint Sector Review platform, and farmer training under reform area \n3. \n ", "6 \nlease farm equipment to farmers on an hourly or daily rental basis. The issues \nrelated to maintenance and servicing of the machinery can be addressed by \ndeveloping clear guidelines and a business plan for custom hiring centers, and \nposting these on the Gandaki MOLMAC website to enable policy makers and \nentrepreneurs to address the sustainability risks. To protect crops against pests \nand invasive species, the Cabinet has endorsed for submission to Parliament the \nPlant Protection Act 2007 to clarify the institutional setup, including establishing a \nplant  quarantine  committee  and  federal  government  support  for  provincial \ngovernments in related activities. The program will provide further support in \npreparing  the  related  regulation.  Further,  building  on  the  proposed  third \namendment to the Seed Act 1988 endorsed by the Cabinet for submission to the \nParliament,  national  standards  will  be  devised  for  adoption  by  subnational \ngovernments to protect farmers and further encourage private sector participation \nin seed testing at the provincial and local levels.  \n \n(iii)  Reform Area 3: Institutional capacity strengthened.26 The program will initiate \nactions to develop the capacity of nascent subnational governments to effectively \ncarry out agriculture service delivery as a devolved function under the federal \nstructure of the government. This will be done by providing orientation on the \nnational ADS for all provincial governments and at least 50% of municipalities of \nGandaki Province, including on the ADS\u2019 gender equality and social inclusion \n(GESI) strategy, so that subnational governments can initiate discussions to align \nthe provincial and national strategies. To further promote adoption of modern \nagricultural practices and agribusiness, the program will help Gandaki Province \nadopt  a  training  manual,  prepare  a  socially  and  gender-inclusive  provincial \nstrategic investment plan for prioritized commodities, and integrate the investment \nplan with the province\u2019s medium-term expenditure framework. The GESI will be \nmainstreamed  in  Gandaki  MOLMAC  operations  by  developing  the  terms  of \nreference and nominating a GESI focal person or unit to ensure that the province\u2019s \nplans and programs are gender sensitive and socially inclusive; and that women, \nindigenous people, and marginalized groups are represented in training activities. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB has been Nepal\u2019s key partner in the agriculture sector since \nthe first sector engagement in 1971. Notably, as the lead coordinator of the multidonor initiative \nto design the ADS, 2015\u20132035 (footnote 14), ADB provided TA for the effort.27 Simultaneously, \nADB implemented three agricultural value chain development projects during the current country \npartnership strategy period (2013\u20132017, extended to 2019) to ensure that the strategy is well-\ngrounded on lessons from field experience (footnote 6). The program will build on these initiatives \nby supporting the government to implement its policy commitments, leading to the investment \nprojects currently planned under the ADB Nepal country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 \n(footnote 9). This will be the first ADB agriculture sector PBL under the federal system of \ngovernment, and provides timely support to the government in this transition by putting key \nframeworks in place. \n \n \n26 Policy action 9 is a tranche 1 conditionality and policy actions 20 and 21 are tranche 2 conditionalities related to \nreform area 3. Details are in the Policy Matrix (Appendix 4). \n27 As an advocate of regional cooperation and integration, ADB is studying use of sanitary and phytosanitary measures \nas a trade facilitation instrument under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program (ADB. 2018. \nImplementing Trade Facilitation Initiatives under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program. \nManila). \n ", "7 \n12.  Development partner and/or donor coordination. The ADB program team has closely \ncoordinated  with  other  development  partners  and  donors  in  Nepal,  including  through  the \nDevelopment Partners\u2019 Food Security Group (a group of major development partners in the \nagriculture sector that meets monthly), and the ADS Joint Sector Review Committee (a joint \ndevelopment partners\u2013government platform currently cochaired by USAID and MOALD, and the \nGovernment of Nepal, which was formed to facilitate coordination of development partner support \nfor ADS implementation). Regular information sharing takes place through these platforms. The \nprogram complements efforts by other development partners involved in ADS implementation, \nincluding the European Union\u2019s $40 million policy-based facility;28 support to livestock (World \nBank,  Heifer  International);  seed  industry  (USAID,  International  Fund  for  Agricultural \nDevelopment);  and  financial  services  (Department  for  International  Development,  United \nKingdom). \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n13.  The program is aligned with Nepal\u2019s overarching development objective of accelerating \nprofitable commercialization and competitiveness in the agriculture sector (para. 9). Improved \ncompliance with international food safety standards and uptake of commercial agriculture will help \nachieve the government's development objectives, primarily through: (i) important policy and \nregulatory changes that will be supported in view of needed structural changes in the sector and \ndevolution of powers to the subnational governments; (ii) international accreditation of key testing \nlaboratories, which will address impediments to exports of agricultural products from Nepal, \nreduce transaction costs, and make exports more competitive; (iii) domestic consumption of \nimported and domestic agricultural produce, which will be better monitored for long-term beneficial \nimpacts on human health; and (iv) institutional capacity strengthening in Gandaki Province for \nimproved strategic and investment planning, budget linkages, and dissemination of agricultural \nbest practices and business plans among farmers and general public. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n14.  The transition from a unitary to a federal structure has increased fiscal stress on the federal \ngovernment. Nepal generally had a fiscal surplus until FY2016, but now faces a rising deficit\u2014\nfrom 3.2% of GDP in FY2017 to 7.3% of GDP in FY2019\u2014largely because of increasing \nexpenditures on grants, land, buildings, and civil works.29 The FY2020 budget estimates a deficit \nof $2.9 billion, or 8.4% of GDP. The estimated total financing requirement is $4.4 billion in FY2020, \nof which $2.6 billion will be financed from external borrowings, mostly through official development \nassistance and EXIM Bank. However, the International Monetary Fund projects a ratio of fiscal \ndeficit to GDP of 4.3% in FY2020 and 3.8% in FY2021.30 The government will not have fiscal \nheadroom to incur additional expenses on reforms proposed under the program. \n \n15.  Based on the development financing requirements of the program, the Government of \nNepal has requested a concessional loan of $50 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period \n \n28 The European Union program has a mix of process and outcome level indicators. One of the conditions relates to \nthe drafting and submission of legislation on agribusiness promotion, agriculture markets, and land management. \n29 ADB. 2019. Macroeconomic Update: Nepal, Vol. 7 (No.1). Manila; and Government of Nepal, Ministry of Finance. \n2019. Budget Speech Fiscal Year 2019/20. Speech delivered to Joint Assembly of Federal Parliament by the \nHonorable Finance Minister Dr. Yuba Raj Khatiwada Wednesday, May 29, 2019. The revised fiscal deficit for FY2019 \nis estimated as 5.1% of GDP based on preliminary data available from the Financial Comptroller General Office (ADB \nstaff estimates, September 2019) \n30 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nof 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The funds will be \nreleased in two tranches\u2014$25 million on loan effectiveness and $25 million about 18 months \nlater\u2014once the government has complied with the policy actions. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The executing agency will be the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the implementing \nagencies will be MOALD and Gandaki MOLMAC. The high-level committee (HLC), constituted \nearlier by MOALD to support ADB program processing, will be responsible for overall supervision \nand coordination. The HLC is chaired by the MOALD secretary and has representation from \nfederal MOF, National Planning Commission Secretariat, and Gandaki MOLMAC. The existing \nPBL  Working  Committee  at  MOALD,  which  includes  the  same  members  who  have  been \ncoordinating with ADB in PBL design, will coordinate program implementation. A PBL working \ncommittee will also be formed at Gandaki MOLMAC. Based on the feedback from the working \ncommittee and ADB, the HLC, if necessary, will amend and revise its work programs to ensure \nthe timely and effective implementation of the program. \n \n17.  ADB will undertake periodic review missions to (i) confirm progress and fulfillment of policy \nactions for tranche release; (ii) monitor continued applicability of the assumptions that might \nimpact program success, as well as specified risks and their mitigating measures; and (iii) advise \non actions to maintain effective implementation within the program period. \n \n18.  Procurement, advance contracting, and retroactive financing are not expected.31 The \nprogram will be implemented over 2 years. The proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n19.  The attached transaction TA will assist the implementing agencies to comply with the \nprogram\u2019s second tranche policy conditions.32 The TA is estimated to cost $600,000 of which \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF \n6). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and office \naccommodation. \n \n20.  The implementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned with those of the PBL. ADB \nwill administer the TA. The executing agency will be the MOALD. The PBL working committees \nat MOALD and Gandaki MOLMAC will implement the TA components, and the HLC will be \nresponsible for overall supervision and coordination. A total of 4 person-months of international \nand 35.5 person-months of national consultancy services will be required intermittently. The \nconsultants will be engaged through a consulting firm using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. The TA is estimated to begin in March 2020 and will be \nimplemented over 15 months (until June 2021). All consultants will be recruited in line with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). All disbursements under the TA will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n31 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  Several outputs of the program have technical components at their core. Completion of \nprerequisites  in various  laboratory  units  for  ISO/IEC  accreditation;  notification  of  MRLs  for \nselected  vegetables;  preparation  of  strategic  plans,  investment  plans,  and  business  plans; \ndevelopment of pesticide protocols; surveillance plan; and conducting surveillance will require \nsound technical knowledge. Capacity-building support under the program will assist the relevant \ngovernment departments and agencies to better manage these technical operations. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n22.  A governance risk assessment was conducted in line with the implementation guidelines \nof ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.33 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was also explained to and discussed with MOF. This assessment \nwas complemented by a review of areas of possible governance risks that can affect program \nimplementation. These include risks related to (i) political support for and ownership of the \ngovernment, especially for sensitive reforms; and (ii) institutional dimensions of the program (e.g., \nweak capacity in the relevant institutions, weak coordination between the federal and provincial \ngovernments, and transfer of key personnel responsible for program implementation). These risks \nwill be mitigated through ADB\u2019s continued engagement with the government along with TA \nsupport and implementation monitoring by ADB. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n23.  The program aims to reduce poverty by supporting farmers to adopt modern farming \npractices and increase productivity and incomes. The program will showcase how subnational \ngovernments can deliver more effective services to the agriculture sector. Seed is the most \nimportant input in farming. Improved regulations for seed production and testing, including a \nprovision for farmer compensation in case of poor seed quality, can minimize the income risk to \nfarmers. Clarity on minimum standards for seed-testing laboratories can improve credibility and \navailability of seeds in the local market. Availability of sample business plans will make it easier \nfor farmers to access bank finance. Sustainable and functional custom hiring centers will improve \nfarmers\u2019 access to farm machinery, thus improving their productivity. These measures will provide \nthe framework for farmers\u2019 transition from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture to \nimprove their economic condition. Improved systems for food safety and quality monitoring will \nencourage sustainable agricultural practices and have a beneficial impact on human health. \n \n24.  The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The program is socially \ninclusive and targets gender representation and inclusion of poor and vulnerable groups through \nfarmer training and sensitization training for the Gandaki MOLMAC. Specifically, the policy \nreforms will strengthen and institutionalize GESI in Gandaki Province by providing (i) orientation \non socially and gender-inclusive ADS with select local levels (municipalities), (ii) a socially and \ngender-inclusive strategic investment plan for at least one prioritized commodity in Gandaki \nProvince, (iii) equal opportunity for women and men farmers in agribusiness training, and (iv) \ndesignation of a GESI focal person or unit in Gandaki MOLMAC. This focal will monitor and ensure \nthat GESI-focused actions are well integrated into plans and programs. \n \n \n33 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Plan. Manila. \n ", "10 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n25.  The program is classified as category C for environment and involuntary resettlement and \nis  category  B  for  indigenous  peoples.  The  program\u2019s  policy  actions  will  not  generate  any \nenvironmental or involuntary resettlement impacts. Due diligence has established that the PBL \nwill not have negative impacts on indigenous peoples, and anticipates the generation of positive \nimpacts for indigenous peoples who elect to participate in the Gandaki MOLMAC capacity-\nbuilding plan.34 Measures to ensure that indigenous peoples benefit in a culturally appropriate \nmanner have been covenanted and included in the project design and matrix of potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of policy actions. Several of the program\u2019s policy actions reflect \nthe  government's  commitment  to  combating  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  agriculture. \nAgriculture is directly impacted by climate variability, and the use of quality seeds can help in \nmanaging the risks. Increases in the population of pests and invasive species, and occurrence of \nplant diseases, are potential hazards. Legislative reforms in pesticide management and plant \nprotection supported under the program are aimed toward effective control in the context of a \nchanging environment. \n \n26.  Summary of risk assessment and risk management plan. There are no high or \nsubstantial risks to this program. Risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.35  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n27.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied that the government has \ncompleted the policy actions specified in the policy matrix relating to the program. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n28.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $50,000,000 to Nepal for the Food Safety and Agriculture Commercialization Program, \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; for a term of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n7 October 2019\n \n34 Matrix of Potential Environmental and Social Impacts and Measures (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \n(i) Profitable commercialization and competitiveness accelerated in the agriculture sector (Agricultural \nDevelopment Strategy, 2015\u20122035)a  \n(ii) Agricultural trade balance improved (Agricultural Development Strategy, 2015\u20132035)a \n \nData Sources \nPerformance Indicators with Targets  and Reporting \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the  By 2022:     \nReform  a.
