INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2005 country programming mission, the Government of Mongolia requested \ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in preparing the Western \nRegional Road Development Project (the project). In response, the TA1 has been included in \nADB\u2019s 2006 assistance program for Mongolia. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Mongolia on  \n6\u201310 March 2006 to prepare the TA proposal. The Mission (i) held discussions with government \nofficials and (ii) carried out an initial poverty and social analysis and a rapid environmental \nassessment. This report is based on (i) the agreement reached with the Government on the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, cost, financing and implementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 \nterms of reference for the TA; and (ii) the Mission\u2019s findings. The TA\u2019s design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Mongolia\u2019s landlocked location between the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the \nRussian  Federation  and  remoteness  from  developed  markets  are  major  constraints  to \ndevelopment. Adequate transport links to neighboring countries, in combination with sound \ncross-border  arrangements,  are  vital  to  sustained  growth.  Mongolia  thus  supports  regional \ncooperation  and  is  participating  in  the  ADB-initiated  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Program, which aims to strengthen economic links among Afghanistan, \nAzerbaijan,  PRC,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  \nWith financial assistance from ADB,2 PRC, and Republic of Korea, Mongolia is developing a \ncentral north\u2013south highway through Ulaanbaatar, linking roads in the PRC and the Russian \nFederation. The proposed western road is an additional transport corridor that will be connected \nto the PRC\u2019s road to Urumqi and the Russian Federation\u2019s road to Novosibirsk so as to enhance \nMongolia\u2019s access to regional markets for agricultural and mineral products. \n \n3.  Given its geographic location, Mongolia can serve as a corridor for transit traffic between \nAsia and Europe. Despite their proximity, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) in the \nPRC and the Russian Federation do not have direct land transport links; bilateral trade is mainly \ncarried by railways through Kazakhstan. The proposed western road can serve as an alternative \nand  short  transit  route  between  Xinjiang  and  Siberia  in  the  Russian  Federation,  reducing \ntransport costs and facilitating bilateral trade, tourism, and other economic activities. In the long \nrun, this road, together with the roads in Xinjiang, may become a transit route between Central \nand South Asia and Siberia, thus promoting regional cooperation and integration. The road will \nalso provide Mongolia with a source of foreign exchange earnings, generated through transit \nfees and business opportunities in providing roadside transport services. \n \n4.  Although secondary to railways, roads are an important mode of transport, accounting \nfor 25% of passenger volume and 3% of freight volume in 2004. Despite increased investments \nduring the past years, the road network remains inadequate for the reviving economy. In 2005, \nMongolia\u2019s road network was about 49,250 kilometers (km), comprising 11,219 km of state \nroads and 38,031 km of local roads. About 92% of these roads are earthen tracks; paved and \ngravel roads each account for 3.9% (1,900 km) of the total. Road density (3.1 km per 100 km2) \nand  the  share  of  paved  roads  are  lower  than  international  norms.  Roads  are  particularly \nimportant  for  western  Mongolia  because  it  has  few  alternative  transport  modes  (para.  7).  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 23 February 2006. \n2  ADB approved three loans to Mongolia during 1995\u20132004 for developing the central north\u2013south highway.  \nThe total of $87.1 million comprises (i) $25 million approved in 1995, (ii) $25 million approved in 1999, and  \n(iii) $37.1 million approved in 2004. \n ", "2   \nThe Government attaches importance to developing the road network and places priority on \nconstructing the western road, but requires external assistance to develop road infrastructure, \nas a result of the large funding requirements and continued fiscal constraints. \n \n5.  Development of regional road infrastructure needs to be accompanied by improvements \nin border facilities and cross-border agreements between Mongolia and neighboring countries. \nDespite the approval of the governments of Mongolia and the PRC, however, inadequate border \nfacilities at the border crossing at Yarant (Mongolia)/Takeshiken (PRC) has resulted in the \nborder crossing not being operational throughout the year, and not being open to third-country \ntransport.3 Delays at the border crossing are common because of complicated cross-border \nprocedures  that  have  not  been  harmonized.  Mongolia  signed  cross-border  road  transport \nagreements with the PRC in 1991 and with the Russian Federation in 1996, but Mongolian \nvehicles  can  travel  only  as  far  as  Takeshiken,  the  PRC  town  15  km  from  the  border.  \nFew vehicles from the PRC and the Russian Federation travel in Mongolia because of poor road \nconditions. In an important step to overcome the nonphysical barriers and facilitate the cross-\nborder  movement  of  freight  and  passengers,  Mongolia,  PRC,  and  Russian  Federation \nconcluded negotiations over the draft transit traffic framework agreement in November 2005. \n \n6.  Development is slow in the western region, which includes the aimags (provinces) of \nBayan-Olgiy, Hovd, and Uvs, because it is isolated and far from the capital.4 The western \nregion\u2019s per capita gross domestic product in 2004 was MNT352,600, or 49% of the national \naverage (MNT717,300). The poverty incidence in 2004 was 51%, higher than the national \naverage of 36%. Inadequate transport infrastructure is an important contributor to poverty in the \nwestern region, as it limits local residents\u2019 access to markets, jobs, and social services (e.g., \nhealth and education). No railway lines connect with the region, roads linking it with Ulaanbaatar \nare poor,5 and flights to the region are limited. Because of the western region\u2019s proximity to the \nPRC6 and the Russian Federation, residents meet their needs for energy, food, construction \nmaterials, and other consumer goods mainly through imports from these countries. However, \nthe lack of paved roads results in high transport costs and long travel times. The Government \nrecently  formulated  the  Western  Regional  Economic  Development  Program.  The  program \nincludes developing the western road, which will enable the poorest, isolated western region to \naccess  the  booming  economies  in  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation,  thus  increasing \nopportunities for development. \n \n7.  The proposed western regional road will run for about 750 km from the border with the \nPRC  at  Yarant,  through  Hovd  and  Olgiy,  to  the  border  with  the  Russian  Federation  at \nTsagaannuur. The northern segment of the road (the section between Hovd and Tsagaannuur) \nis also part of Mongolia\u2019s main east\u2013west road corridor. About 680 km of the road are earthen \ntrack. The proposed alignment is likely to pass through the ecologically sensitive area of the \nKhar-Us Lake National Park, as well as an area that has some ethnic minorities, including \nKazakhs  and  Zahchin.7 The  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation  have  built  paved  roads  to \nMongolian borders,8 but both roads need to be upgraded if traffic volumes are to increase \nsignificantly. \n                                                 \n3  The Yarant\u2013Takeshiken border point opens from the 15th to the 30th of each month, during April\u2013December. \n4  The distance between Hovd and Ulaanbaatar is about 1,500 km. \n5  The World Bank has helped Mongolia improve the road connecting the western region to Ulaanbaatar. \n6  Yarant is 380 km from Altay city and 570 km from Urumqi in the PRC. \n7  Kazakhs account for 89% of the population in Bayan-Olgiy Aimag, while Zahchin account for 25% of the population \nin Hovd Aimag. \n8  The PRC built a two-lane paved road from Takeshiken to the border with Mongolia in 1994, with a 5.0-meter (m) \nwide pavement and 0.5 m shoulders. \n ", "  3\n8.  Mongolia, PRC, and Russian Federation have supported developing the western road. \nThe Russian Federation conducted a study of the routes during 1999\u20132000. Officials from \nMongolia  and  Xinjiang  jointly  examined  the  alignment  and  made  preliminary  economic, \nenvironmental, and social assessments in 2003. Mongolia has started developing the road \nthrough government funding. Eight concrete bridges were constructed, a new customs facility at \nTsagaannuur became operational in August 2005, and a 64 km paved road section between \nYarant and Bulgan was opened to the public in November 2005. Construction of a 30 km paved \nroad section in the north of Olgiy is expected to be completed in 2006. \n \n9.  An ADB-funded pre-feasibility study of the project was carried out in 2005.9 The study \nexamined alternative routes10 for the proposed road and concluded that the Yarant\u2013Hovd\u2013\nOlgiy\u2013Tsagaannuur route would be the most suitable and technically viable. The economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of the project was estimated at 8\u201310%, which the study concluded \nwas sufficiently high to justify undertaking a full feasibility study, taking into account the project\u2019s \nexpected social benefits for western Mongolia.11 Trade flows are the key to assessing the \neconomic viability of the project. However, because of time and resource constraints, the pre-\nfeasibility study did not include a detailed analysis of trade between Xinjiang and Siberia using \nthe western road. This may have resulted in lower traffic projections for the western road and \nunderestimated project benefits, leading to a lower EIRR for the project. The potential for \nsignificant  trade  between  Xinjiang  and  Siberia  using  the  western  road  strongly  justifies \nproceeding with the TA, by undertaking a detailed analysis of future trade between western \nMongolia and neighboring countries, and including the analysis results in the project\u2019s economic \nanalysis. \n \n10.  Two specific issues relating to the project need to be highlighted. First, the proposed \nroad is anticipated to benefit both Mongolia and its neighboring countries. An analysis of the \ndistribution  of  project  benefits  among  the  three  major  beneficiaries  (Mongolia,  PRC,  and \nRussian Federation) is crucial to the TA and project designs, including preparation of a financing \nplan for the project. Second, because this is a large investment project with benefits accruing \nbeyond Mongolia, cofinancing is important. The TA will address these issues. \n \n11.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Mongolia and \nregional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  for  CAREC.  The  CSP  for  Mongolia12 and  the \nregional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  update  for  CAREC13 reconfirm  transport  as  a \nstrategically important sector for ADB assistance. The CSP identifies the underdeveloped road \nnetwork and inefficient cross-border road transport as major transport sector issues. Transport \nsector performance indicators contained within the CSP include expanding the length of the \nroad network and increasing traffic volumes. The TA will tackle the sector issues and help \nachieve the sector performance indicators in the CSP. \n \n12.  As of the end of 2005, ADB had approved five loans totaling $147.1 million, and 11 TA \nprojects  totaling  $6.0  million  for  the  transport  sector.  ADB  assistance  helped  (i)  develop \n                                                 \n9  ADB approved the small-scale TA amounting to $150,000 to Mongolia for undertaking the pre-feasibility study of \nthe western regional road corridor development in September 2005. \n10 The alternative routes include the (i) route from Olgiy to the border with the PRC near Gantsmod, (ii) route from \nHovd to the border with the PRC at Burgastay, and (iii) route from Hovd to the border with the Russian Federation \nat Norshoo via Ulaangom. \n11 ADB. 2005.

ADB\u2019s sector portfolio performance in Mongolia is \ngenerally satisfactory. The 2002 evaluation of the country assistance program14 concluded that \nADB-assisted transport projects helped (i) increase traffic counts, (ii) advance sector reforms,  \n(iii) expand economic activities in the project areas, and (iv) improve regional links. Lessons \nlearned from ongoing and completed ADB projects will be incorporated into the TA and project \ndesign. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA\u2019s impact will be strengthened transport links between western Mongolia and the \nPRC and the Russian Federation. The TA will help the Government prepare a feasibility study \nand preliminary design for the Western Regional Road Development Project in a manner that is \ncompatible with ADB financing requirements. The TA outcome is the agreed design of the \nresulting project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. Phase I will (i) assess the economic viability \nof the project; (ii) analyze the distribution of the project benefits among Mongolia, PRC, and \nRussian Federation; (iii) assess the suitability of ADB financing of the project; and (iv) discuss \ncofinancing issues with PRC, Russian Federation, and possibly Kazakhstan and others, and \nobtain some cofinancing commitments. A review at the end of phase I will assess the outputs. \nSubject to the satisfactory outcome of phase I, phase II will be implemented to complete the \npreliminary design of a loan project suitable for ADB financing. \n \n15.  The TA is designed, and will be implemented, in line with ADB\u2019s CSP for Mongolia and \nthe  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  for  CAREC,  as  well  as  the  Government\u2019s \nSocioeconomic Guidelines for 2006\u20132008 and the Western Regional Economic Development \nProgram. International consultants, with support from domestic consultants, will be engaged to \nimplement the TA. The initial poverty and social analysis (Appendix 2) and rapid environmental \nassessment for the project, carried out during the TA Fact-Finding Mission, (i) examined poverty \nstatus, ethnic minority and gender issues, resettlement effects, and environmental conditions in \nthe project area; and (ii) identified the social and environmental issues that need to be further \nexamined and addressed during the TA. The consultants will help prepare a technically and \neconomically  feasible  investment  project.  The  consultants  will  also  help  the  Government \nprepare an environmental impact assessment, an ethnic minority development plan, and, if \nnecessary, a short resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s policies on the environment, \nindigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement15 to maximize project benefits and mitigate \nnegative impacts. The TA will develop a results-based project framework, including monitoring \nindicators for development impacts and baseline data. \n \n16.  Key TA activities will include (i) field surveys; (ii) document reviews; (iii) data analysis; \n(iv) desk studies; and (v) consultation with various stakeholders, including government officials \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2002.

The total cost of the TA is estimated at $765,000. The Government has requested that \nADB provide $650,000 to cover the most of the TA cost. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance $115,000 in kind by providing \ncounterpart staff, office space and facilities, and support services. The detailed cost estimates \nand a financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Ministry of Road, Transport and Tourism (MORTT) will be the Executing Agency \nand  the  Road  Supervision  and  Research  Center  under  MORTT  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency. MORTT will appoint a TA coordinator to (i) supervise TA activities; (ii) resolve any \nissues  that  may  arise  during  implementation;  and  (iii)  facilitate  coordination  among  the \nconsultants, government agencies, and other stakeholders. MORTT will ensure coordination \namong  the  Ministry  of  Finance;  Ministry  of  Nature  and  Environment;  Customs  General \nAdministration; Agency for Administration of Land Affairs, Geodesy and Cartography; and local \ngovernments in the western region. MORTT will provide the consultant\u2019 with the documents, \ndata, maps, and other information needed to implement the TA. \n \n19.  The TA will require about 62 person-months of consultant inputs (20 international and  \n42 domestic), comprising 30 person-months in phase I and 32 person-months in phase II.  \nThe international consultants\u2019 team will comprise (i) a road engineer and team leader, (ii) a \ntransport  economist,  (iii)  a  trade  and  customs  specialist,  (iv)  a  road  transport  and  logistic \nservices specialist, (v) a financial specialist, (vi) an environment specialist, and (vii) a social \ndevelopment specialist. The international consultants will be supported by domestic consultants \nwith expertise in road engineering, transport economics, trade and customs, financial analysis, \nroad safety, road transport and logistic services, environmental assessment, and social and \npoverty analysis. The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. An international \nconsulting firm in association with domestic consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance \nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  recruitment  of  domestic  consultants.  \nThe consulting firm will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method and \nsimplified technical proposal procedures. The consultants will purchase office equipment in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The consultants are expected to start services \nin June or July 2006 and the TA is expected to be completed by 31 March 2007. Stakeholder \nworkshops will be held to review the consultants\u2019 reports. The consultant\u2019s reports will be posted \non ADB\u2019s website upon TA completion. \n \nIV.

The project area is far from \nUlaanbaatar but could improve economic links with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation. \nHowever, existing roads cannot handle future traffic and seriously constrain economic development. The project will \ndevelop the road between Yarant on the border with the PRC and Tsagaannuur on the border with the Russian \nFederation, via Hovd and Olgiy. The project road will reduce travel time and cost, and road accidents, thereby helping \n(i) speed up economic development (e.g., mineral development and tourism); (ii) creating jobs; and (iii) improve \naccess to social services. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe Project will directly help reduce poverty by (i) creating construction jobs in the short term; and (ii) improving \naccess to markets for agricultural products, including specialty cash crops such as vegetables and flours. The project \nwill substantially improve transport infrastructure to facilitate economic development in western Mongolia, which will \ncreate jobs and income for local people. \n \nThe project will improve access to social services in the three aimags in western Mongolia, with a population of about \n270,000. The poverty incidence in Bayan-Olgiy, Hovd, and Uvs was 51% in 2004, higher than the national average of \n36%. Much of the poverty stems from unemployment, insufficient livestock, absence of local markets, and lack of \neducation. These aimags import most of their energy needs, so road improvements will reduce costs and benefit local \nresidents. \n \nA detailed poverty analysis will assess poverty incidence in the project area and demonstrate how the project will help \nreduce poverty by incorporating specific measures in the project scope. The analysis will be based on the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis (2001) and Handbook for Integrating Poverty \nImpact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects (2001). \n \nC.

Introduction \n1.  The consultants will undertake a feasibility study and preliminary design for the Western \nRegional Road Development Project (the project). The proposed western road will run from the \nborder  crossing  between  Mongolia  (Yarant)  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC) \n(Takeshiken), through Hovd and Olgiy, to the border crossing between Mongolia (Tsagaannuur) \nand the Russian Federation (Tashanta). International consultants, with support from domestic \nconsultants, will be engaged. The TA will be implemented in two phases. Consulting services will \ninclude, but will not be limited to, the following: \n \nB.  Detailed Terms of Reference in Phase I \n \n  1.  Road Engineering (international, 3 person-months; and domestic, 6 person-months) \n \n2.
