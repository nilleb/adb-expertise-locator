INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) to the Government of Pakistan will \nimprove the corporate governance and performance of its 206 state-owned enterprises (SOEs). \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide support to the government in high priority areas \nthat are included in the draft SOE (Governance and Operations) Bill 2021, which is before the \nNational Assembly of Pakistan (Parliament), and in the new SOE Ownership and Management \nPolicy (SOMP) that is being developed. The TA contains actions and initiatives in support of the \nfollowing reforms: (i) strategic policy framework for SOEs improved, (ii) legal and regulatory \nframework  for  SOE  reform  improved,  (iii)  SOE  corporate  governance  improved,  and  (iv) \ninstitutional capacity for SOE reform implementation and ownership monitoring improved.1  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030,2 particularly on \naccelerating progress in gender equity and on strengthening governance and institutional capacity; \nthe Sustainable Development Goals; ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Pakistan, 2020\u2013\n2022;3 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2021\u20132025.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  International Monetary Fund Extended Fund Facility. The International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) Extended Fund Facility was approved in July 2019 to restore economic stability and secure \nexternal financial support (worth $6.0 billion over 39 months) following a year of misaligned \neconomic policies, which had fueled consumption and short-term growth but had weakened \nmacroeconomic buffers, increased external and public debt, and depleted international reserves. \nAs a result, the government raised import duties and charges to compress imports. To improve \nthe overall fiscal situation, it introduced new taxes and higher tax rates and eliminated most tax \nconcessions to raise revenue and lower the primary fiscal deficit. Power and gas prices were \nadjusted upward to reduce quasi-fiscal losses and subsidies.5 SOE reform was also identified as \nkey to address structural impediments to macro-fiscal stability. SOEs have a substantial presence \nin delivering public services and implementing public policies and, thus, play a crucial role in \neconomic development. Although SOEs are the dominant potential providers in many sectors, \nsuch  as  transport,  utilities,  energy,  finance,  and  health,  many  of  them  are  financially  and \noperationally unsustainable and must rely heavily on the government\u2019s continuous financial \nsupport to sustain their operations. In the 5 years from FY2013 to FY2017, for example, the loans \nand subsidies paid to SOEs from the federal budget totaled $12.8 billion. \n \n4.  Status  of  Pakistan\u2019s  state-owned  enterprises.  Pakistan  has  206  SOEs  that  are \nincorporated under various legal structures.  Most of them (186) are established under the \nCompanies Act 2017. Of these, 139 are deemed commercial entities while 47 are registered as \nSection 42 companies (deemed noncommercial enterprises). The remaining SOEs comprise \nstatutory authorities and development finance institutions. SOEs operate in most economic \nsectors including transport, ports, power, highways, manufacturing and heavy industries, the \npostal service, and finance. They are often either the dominant or monopoly service providers in \ntheir sector. The overall revenues of all the SOEs in FY2019 were about $24.7 billion while the \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 August 2021. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Revenues in FY2019 were about 10% of nominal \ngross domestic product (GDP). In 2020, SOEs also provided employment to more than 450,000 \npeople (about 0.8% of the total workforce) (footnote 5). \n \n5.  Poor financial performance. Despite its size and economic significance, the financial \nand operational performance of the SOE portfolio has been weak.6 More than 98% of the \ngovernment\u2019s  assets  and  almost  100%  of the losses  in  the  SOEs  portfolio  are  related  to \ncommercial SOEs. In FY2019, the most recent data available, the portfolio comprised $119.0 \nbillion in total assets and $31.5 billion in total equity but generated a return on assets of \u20131.37% \nand a return on equity of \u20135.16%. The only sectors in which SOEs achieved positive results were \nfinance, generating a return on assets of 0.70%, and promotion and advocacy, generating 0.68% \n(footnote 6). The three sectors with the largest negative returns on assets were industry and \nengineering (\u20136.63%), transport (\u20134.17%), and services (\u20133.04%). The losses in the four largest \nSOEs (Pakistan International Airlines, Pakistan Steel Mills, Pakistan Railways, and the National \nHighway Authority) totaled more than 3.0% of GDP. The government has continued to provide \nloss-making SOEs with ongoing financial support, which has also exacerbated the negative \nimpact of the coronavirus disease pandemic on the fiscal position.7 Loans and subsidies paid to \nSOEs and funded from the federal government budget totaled $3.51 billion in FY2017 (about 1.8% \nof GDP). \n \n6.  Drivers of poor state-owned enterprise performance. An ADB-sponsored diagnostic \nreview of Pakistan\u2019s SOE portfolio, undertaken in 2020, identified the following key drivers of poor \nSOE performance:8 \n(i)   There is no consistent and overarching law that applies to all SOEs so that they \noperate under a common legal framework. \n(ii)  An  overarching  SOE  ownership  and  reform  policy  is  lacking  and  many  reform \ndecisions lack robust policy analysis. \n(iii)  Many SOEs operate under a confused mandate where they are responsible for \ncommercial  and  noncommercial  activities  and  have  regulatory  and  operational \nresponsibilities.   \n(iv)  Governance practices are poor. Public servants dominate many boards, directors are \nnot empowered to function effectively because of high levels of inappropriate political \ninfluence,  and  directors  often  lack  the  professional  skills  required  to  properly \nundertake their roles.  \n(v)  There is no formal community service obligation framework to reinforce a clear and \nunambiguous commercial mandate. \n(vi)  SOE ownership monitoring is decentralized among  20 ministries and agencies. \nWhere line or sector ministries are responsible for the ownership monitoring of SOEs \noperating within their sector, this creates an irreconcilable conflict of interest. It also \nmakes it difficult to develop a center of excellence in SOE monitoring and ensure a \nconsistent approach to SOE oversight and consistent reform policies and practices. \n(vii)  Numerous forums and public sector accountability organizations intervene in the \naffairs of SOEs. These multiple layers of accountability distort and undermine the \nperformance and accountability systems.  \n \n6  SOE portfolio is defined as all companies and other corporate bodies that are owned and controlled by the Federal \nGovernment as per the definition in the SOE Bill. ROA is defined as net profit or loss divided by average total assets. \n7  IMF. 2021.

Washington, DC. \n8  ADB. Diagnostic Report on Pakistan\u2019s State-Owned Enterprises: Summary of Current Status of Pakistan SOE \nEnvironment and Recommendations for Reform. Unpublished. \n \n ", "3 \n(viii) There is a lack of transparency and accountability. Requirements relating to the \npreparation of strategic business plan are weak, and many SOEs do not publish their \nannual reports on their websites as required by the Public Sector Company Corporate \nGovernance Rules 2017. \n \n7.  ADB support for state-owned enterprise reform. In February 2021, following the \npreparation of a 2020 ADB-funded diagnostic study on the status of SOEs in Pakistan and ADB \nsupport for the development of the final SOE structural benchmark under the Extended Fund \nFacility,9 (i.e., the development of a new SOE law), the government requested follow-on ADB TA \nsupport to build on these early achievements and help it progressively implement its reform \npriorities.  These  included  (i)  adopting  and  implementing  the  new  SOE  law  that  is  before \nParliament (para. 1), (ii) developing and adopting an SOE ownership and reform policy that would \nguide future reform activities, (iii) ensuring that SOE boards operate under a clear commercial \nmandate, and (iv) establishing a central SOE ownership monitoring entity to enable effective \nownership monitoring including ensuring the SOE board is held accountable for performance. The \npolicy and institutional reforms supported by the proposed TA would also be closely coordinated \nwith the preparation of subprogram 2 for an ongoing ADB policy-based loan in the energy sector.10 \nSupporting these efforts would also be consistent with the following lessons from the 2016 Public \nSector  Enterprises  Reform  Program  (ADB\u2019s  last  dedicated  policy  financing  engagement  in \nsupport of SOE reform in Pakistan) and the 2020 Third Capital Markets Development Program:11 \n(i) SOE reform programs are more likely to achieve sustainable results if they are guided by a \nclear statement of the vision and objectives of the reform efforts, (ii) it is important to provide \nsufficient TA resources, (iii) is part of a long-term engagement,  (iv) effective policy analysis needs \nto take place prior to design and consultations before assumptions are made, and (v) the basis \nfor performance measurement and targets are based on an assessment of current performance \nand what can be realistically achieved by the end of the TA.12 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: macroeconomic management strengthened, \nand more sustained and inclusive growth supported.13 The TA will have the following outcome: \nSOE corporate governance, commercial performance, and public service delivery improved; and \nreliance on the national budget decreased.14 Therefore, an outcome performance indicator for \nthis TA is a target return on assets of 1.0% for all commercial SOEs (which would result in a $1.2 \nbillion improvement in portfolio profitability) by FY2024. The final scope and design of the TA \nincorporates lessons from past SOE reform support to Pakistan and other countries in the region \n(footnote 10). There has also been close coordination with a proposed regional knowledge and \nsupport TA to support the development of transaction partnerships and business opportunities for \n \n9  ADB. 2018.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n9.  Output 1: Strategic policy framework for state-owned enterprises improved. The \ndevelopment and implementation of the SOMP is key to the success and sustainability of SOE \nreform as it will guide reform activities for the next 2\u20133 years. The SOMP will support and focus \non the existing SOE reform momentum pending enactment of the draft SOE (Governance and \nOperations) Bill 2021. Output 1 will support the (i) development of a community service obligation \nframework, (ii) development of a skills-based SOE director selection and appointment process \nand a system for director performance reviews; (iii) development of an SOE director training \nprogram, (iv) development of an SOE reform actions pipeline; and (v) establishment of SOE \nownership monitoring within the relevant line ministries and coordination with a central monitoring \nunit (CMU). This work will be closely coordinated with the World Bank\u2019s SOE triage reform \n(footnote 11). \n \n10.  Output  2:  Legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  state-owned  enterprise  reform \nimproved. The government, with dedicated support from ADB and the IMF, has made significant \nprogress on the draft SOE (Governance and Operations) Bill 2021. Although the bill is before \nParliament, further changes may be required, and it may not be enacted for a further 12 months. \nIt is expected that further drafting, mainly of needed adjustments, will be required in 2021 as \nconsultation and debate on the bill proceed. Under this output, the TA will also support any \nconsequential amendments to the bill, as well as the drafting of rules and ancillary documents \nonce the law is enacted. \n \n11.  Output 3: State-owned enterprises corporate governance improved. The SOMP will \ninclude measures to improve corporate governance. Under this output, the TA will support the \nimplementation of the following policies for each SOE: (i) skills-based director selection and \nappointment process, (ii) performance reviews and director training, and (iii) strategic business \nplans that are prepared in accordance with the requirements set out in the SOE Bill and include \nintegrated strategic approaches to address climate change risks and opportunities starting with \nan assessment of climate change vulnerabilities on service delivery.   \n \n12.  Output 4: Institutional capacity for state-owned enterprises reform implementation \nand performance monitoring improved. The TA will focus on two main activities under this \noutput: (i) help build monitoring, evaluation, and reporting capacity within the SOEs; and (ii) assist \nthe Ministry of Finance in establishing and operationalizing the CMU. SOE capacity building will \ntarget SOE boards and management to improve their knowledge and understanding of their duties \nand responsibilities as contained in the draft SOE (Governance and Operations) Bill 2021 and the \nSOMP. In addition, the TA will develop the CMU\u2019s monitoring procedures and practices, including \ndeveloping data-capturing and analytical systems and building the capacity of CMU staff as they \nare recruited. There is scope to integrate gender empowerment features in the TA, so additional \nactivities could include (i) incorporating gender perspectives in the human resources policies of \nSOEs; (ii) assessing the development opportunities for women in technical, supervisory, and \nmanagement positions; (iii) and engaging women from the communities in which SOEs operate \n \n15 The working title for the regional knowledge and support TA is State-Owned Enterprises Commercialization and \nSustainability Enhancement Program in the Central and West Asia Region. \n16 Independent Evaluation Department. 2018.
