The  Government  of  Pakistan\u2019s  sustained  commitment  to  structural  reforms  has \ncontributed to economic growth during the fiscal year 2003 at a pace not seen in the last 6 \nyears. Agriculture, manufacturing, and services all recorded higher growth. This growth has set \nthe stage for deepening the ongoing reforms to consolidate the gains and initiate second-\ngeneration  reforms,  including  in  the  priority  sectors  of  agriculture  and  small  and  medium \nenterprises (SMEs)1 where access to affordable and adequate credit is still one of the main \nconstraints.  To  supplement  the  ongoing  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  for \nagriculture, microfinance, rural finance, and SME sector reforms,2 the Country Strategy and \nProgram  (2002-2006)  includes  an  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)3  grant  in  2003  for \nstrengthening secured transactions4 to further enhance access to  credit for agriculture and \nSMEs. An ADB fact-finding mission visited Pakistan in February 2003. This TA report reflects \nthe  understanding  reached  with  the  Government  on  objectives,  scope,  cost,  financing, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Credit to farmers and rural and urban SMEs, or debtors in general, flow from three major \nsources or creditors:5 savers, debtors themselves, and financial intermediaries such as banks. \nThe savers can directly provide funds to debtors, such as by way of bonds, and indirectly \nthrough deposits in banks that lend to debtors. Debtors themselves provide credit to their buyers \nand receive credit from their suppliers. Credit at each level is secured by real and/or movable \nproperty through conventional forms of security interest that include pledges, floating charges, \nhypothecation, and mortgages; conditional sales with retentions or reversion of titles; and \nassignment of rights to accounts receivables that secure a loan. Movable collaterals, relevant \nfor farmers and SMEs, include those (i) that can be easily identified, such as tractors; (ii) that \ncannot be specifically identified, such as grain in silos; and (iii) being transformed during \nprocessing  such  as  agriculture  produce.  The  list  extends  to  cover  current  assets  and \nreceivables;  intangibles  such  as  trademarks,  patents,  credit  sales  contracts;  and  goods, \nincluding crops yet to be produced.  \n \n3.  Fixed and movable property complement each other in the capital stock. For instance, \nequipment and inventories need to be located on real property to set up an SME. As economies \nmodernize or aim to modernize, the significance of movable collateral grows. However, relative \nto the use of real property, the use of  movable property as collateral is not widespread in \n                                                 \n1 The Economic Revival Program (1999) of the Government identifies four priority areas: agriculture, small and \nmedium industries, oil and gas sector, and information technology.  \n2  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 29 January 2003. \n4  A secured transaction, regardless of its form, is intended to create a security interest in movable and immovable \nproperty. A security interest is a right given to one party to secure payment or performance of an obligation. \nCollateral constitutes the asset over which security is granted.  \n5  Banks, enterprises or producers, and nonbank creditors (traders, input suppliers, wholesalers, retailers) can be \neither creditors or debtors, or both.  \n ", "2    \nPakistan.6 This is due to both generic issues in secured transactions and issues that are specific \nto movable property. Secured transactions in Pakistan, as in the region, are affected by the \ntime, cost, and uncertainty in (i) establishing claim to the property to secure payment of credit, \nwhile allowing the debtor to retain possession of the collateral; (ii) prioritizing claims; (iii) \npublicizing the ranking of the priority; and (iv) taking possession of the collateral for sale to \nsatisfy the claim. Gaps exist in coverage of movable properties and types of creditors and \ndebtors as well as transactions. While registration lies at the heart of secured transactions, only \na narrow range of security in movable property can be publicized by registration.  Although \nsecurity may be created on movable assets owned and/or possessed by unincorporated entities \nincluding sole proprietorships, registration of such security is limited to companies only. This \nexcludes most farmers and SMEs.  \n \n4.  The underutilization of movables as collateral has economic impacts. If debtors are \nunable to use their movables as collateral while at the same time retaining the property for \nproductive use in their business, such debtors in their role as producers and traders will provide \nlittle suppliers credit to their customers, thus limiting the potential scale of operations. Farmers \nand SMEs rarely have sufficient land or access to guarantors, which limits their access to credit \nand increases the cost of credit. Moreover, the amount of credit is determined more by the \nnetwork of relationships, rather than by contract as a modern economy would demand. These \nfactors restrict the growth of SMEs in Pakistan where the bulk of SMEs are engaged in trade \nand services (51% and 35%, respectively), and have most of their assets in inventories and \nreceivables. As the economy evolves into the domain of digital economy, one of the country\u2019s \npriorities (footnote 1), a secured transactions regime for movables becomes more important. \nThe value of new economy enterprises is typically based on intangibles such as patents, \ncopyrights,  brand  names,  and  software  codes.  Further,  accounts  receivables  comprise  a \nsignificant proportion of their assets. As most of these entrepreneurs start as SMEs, absence of \nan effective secured transactions regime for movables will affect new technology enterprises.  \n \n5.  A large rural sector and widespread poverty magnifies the problems. While at the lower \nend of the rural finance market social pressure is used to secure microloans, the middle \nsegment comprising small farmers and SMEs has little real property or imperfect title to small \nparcels of land that cannot provide access to adequate and affordable medium- to long-term \ncredit. The Government response through credit quota and guarantee instead of augmenting \nthe supply of credit raises the risk profile of rural credit and deters commercial banks  from \nexpanding their rural credit portfolio. The inadequate institutional arrangement for issue of land \npassbooks also affects rural credit outreach. While the low repayment rate of rural credit, at \n60%, can be attributed to many reasons, lack of an effective mechanism for repossession of \ncollateral encourages willful defaults. Due to these reasons, the rural credit market remains \nshallow and lacks variety and range in the services provided. Banks meet less than one-fifth of \nthe potential rural credit demand.7 In addition, inadequate use of movables as collateral also \nimpacts the microloan outreach, as microloan providers, including input traders and suppliers, \nare unable to use their loan portfolios as collateral for credit to refinance microloan operations.8  \n \n6.  Despite the legal and institutional constraints, an effective secured transactions regime \nis well within the grasp of Pakistan.  The issues (paras. 3-5) can be addressed through a \nframework for secured transactions that (i) seeks and allows comprehensive registration of all \n                                                 \n6  Movable capital is estimated to account for one third of the industrial capital stock in the United States of America.  \n7 ADB. 2002.

Reducing  risk  through  an  effective  secured  transactions  regime  can  lead  to  lower \nlending  interest  rates  and  increase  the  supply  of  credit,  thus  supplementing  the  ongoing \nagriculture, microfinance, rural finance, and SME sector reforms (para. 1) being supported by \nADB. While these reforms address demand and supply constraints for ensuring greater access \nof  farmers  and  SMEs  to  credit,  secured  transactions  reform  is  also  necessary  to  build \nconfidence in the promissory nature of financial transactions and  facilitate diversification of \ncredit risk and financial intermediation by encouraging nonbank creditors.11 Furthermore, an \neffective  secured  transactions  regime  facilitates  futures  trading  in  agricultural  commodities \nincluding the functioning of commodity exchanges,12 and will also enhance the potential benefits \nof  ADB-pipeline  projects  for  housing,  microfinance,  agribusiness,  and  public-private \ninfrastructure. \n \n8.  The TA will help the Government develop an integrated reform framework for unleashing \nthe economic potential of collateral as an instrument for securing financial transactions, while \nproviding adequate debtor protection for the vulnerable groups.13 Secured transactions reform \ncan make a key contribution to employment generation and poverty reduction. Experience \nshows that society gains from the reduced cost of supplying credit and from the gains in total \noutput that arise from credit expansion made possible through the expanded pool of assets that \ncan be used as collateral. \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Outputs  \n \n9.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  developing  a  secured  transactions  reform \nframework that can facilitate the creation, perfection, and enforcement of collateral interest by \nimproving laws, regulations, and institutions. Secured transactions reform require patient and \nsensitive consensus building, as it needs to consider a variety of laws such as those relating to \ncivil procedure, registration, contract, and companies. Sustained awareness and exposure are \ntherefore required for developing a sequenced approach to secured transactions reform14 in the \ncontext  of  ongoing  economy-wide  structural  adjustment,  including  ADB-supported  sector \nreforms (paras. 1 and 7). \n \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2001.

The TA will support the development of a secured transactions legal reform framework \nand design of a modern registration system through comprehensive analysis and extensive \nconsensus and awareness building efforts. The secured transactions legal reform framework \nand design of a modern registration system developed with TA assistance will be harmonized \nwith good governance practices, efforts to support the private sector, and laws on social \nprotection of debtors and consumer protection. In addition, the TA will assess the problems in \nproviding land passbooks to small farmers and suggest means to mitigate such problems in the \ncontext of existing laws.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n11.  To accomplish its objectives, the TA will be implemented in 2 phases. \n  \n12.  Draft Secured Transactions Reform Framework. In phase 1, a diagnostic study will (i) \nassess existing laws, regulations, and institutions relating to secured transactions and estimate \nthe potential economic impact of the reforms, with particular reference to agriculture and SME \nsectors; and (ii) set out secured transactions reform options with suggested sequencing to be \ndiscussed  at  a  consensus-building  stakeholder  workshop.15 After incorporating stakeholder \ncomments, a draft secured transactions reform framework with legal, economic, and institutional \nannotations will be prepared and discussed at another stakeholder workshop. The revised draft \nsecured transactions reform framework will then be posted on the web sites of stakeholders for \nwider publicity.  \n \n13.  Ministry of Finance (MOF), in consultation with ADB, will select secured transactions \nlegal frameworks and accompanying registration systems in two countries for study-visits by 6 \npersons each. Following the study-visits, a stakeholder workshop will be conducted to discuss \nthe  secured  transactions  legal  and  regulatory  framework  needed  to  support  a  modern \nregistration system in Pakistan. Thereafter, the draft secured transactions reform framework \n(para. 12) will be revised through consultant inputs to support a modern registration system \ntaking account of (i) experience from countries that have undertaken such reforms, (ii) legal \ndesign input drawn from relevant ADB regional TA reports, and (iii) relevant Pakistan legal \nreports. The consultants will use these inputs for preparing a policy, legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional  design  input  report.  A  stakeholder  workshop,  with  ADB  participation,  will  be \nconducted to review this report for the TA to continue to phase 2.  \n \n14.  Secured  Transactions  Legal  Reform  Framework16  and  Design  of  a  Modern \nRegistration System. Using the policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional design input report \n(para.  13),  the  consultants  will  prepare  in  phase  2  a  secured  transactions  legal  reform \nframework and the design of a modern registration system, with due regard to accessibility and \naffordability to farmers and SMEs. The equipment, software, staffing, and fee structure for the \nregistration system will be assessed. In addition, the feasibility of a private sector and/or public-\nprivate  partnership  model  for  the  registration  system  will  be  studied.  Two  stakeholder \nawareness-building workshops will be conducted covering both the secured transactions legal \nreform framework and the design of a modern registration system. At the end of the TA, MOF \nwill identify at least two participants as nodal points and the TA reports will be posted on the \nweb sites of all the participating agencies.  \n \n                                                 \n15 The Ministry of Finance in consultation with ADB will select the workshop participants.  \n16 Based on the TA findings, this could include a secured transactions law or amendments to existing laws, or both. \n ", "     5\n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, consisting of $255,000 in \nforeign exchange and $370,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide on a grant basis, \nunder ADB\u2019s TA funding program, the entire foreign exchange cost and $245,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency cost. The Government will finance the remaining local currency cost of \n$125,000 equivalent in kind. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MOF will be the executing agency for the TA. For TA implementation, MOF will form a \nTA steering committee comprising representatives from State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the \ncentral bank; SME Bank; Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited; Khushhali Bank; Ministry of Food, \nAgriculture, and Livestock; Ministry of Law, Justice, Human Rights, and Parliamentary Affairs; \nMinistry  of  Industries  and  Production;  and  SME  Development  Authority.  The  TA  steering \ncommittee, through its chairperson designate, will be responsible for overall implementation. \nSBP, the implementing agency, on behalf of MOF will implement and coordinate the studies, \nanalysis, and outputs under the TA. SBP will provide office space, one counterpart staff, and \nsupport services at its head office.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months beginning in February 2004 and completed \nby June 2005. Four tripartite review meetings involving the TA steering committee, the TA \nconsultants, and ADB will be organized by SBP during the TA in conjunction with ADB missions \nto review implementation and resolve any outstanding issue. The meetings will be chaired by \nMOF. The TA will require 6 person-months of international and 35 person-months of domestic \nconsulting inputs in secured transactions law and registration system, economic and financial \nanalyses, nonbank and SME credit, and workshop facilitation. The terms of reference for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging domestic consultants. The quality- and cost-based selection method with simplified \ntechnical proposals will be used in selecting the consulting firm.  \n \n18.  The TA consultants will prepare (i) an inception report including a detailed work program, \nto be submitted within 3 weeks of the start of the TA and to be discussed at the initial tripartite \nreview meeting; (ii) quarterly progress reports on overall work progress during the period under \nreview, the work program for the following quarter, and any outstanding issue; (iii) two interim \nreports, presenting draft outputs to be submitted within 6 months of the start of the TA for phase \n1 and within 12 months of the start of the TA for phase 2, and to be discussed at the interim \ntripartite review  meetings for phase 1 and phase 2; (iv) a draft final report compiling all TA \nactivities and consultants\u2019 recommendations, to be submitted at least 1 month before TA \ncompletion and to be discussed at the final tripartite review meeting; and (v) a final report at the \ncompletion of the TA. MOF and SBP will undertake a final evaluation of the TA jointly with ADB, \nbased on the draft final report. The consultants will finalize the draft final report, based on the \nconclusions reached at the final tripartite review meeting.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Pakistan for Strengthening Secured Transactions, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.
