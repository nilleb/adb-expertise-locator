During the Country Programming Mission from 9 to 23 July 2007, the Government of \nIndia  (the Government) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide assistance \nfor Energy Efficiency Enhancement in the Power Generation Sector1. ADB conducted the Fact-\nFinding Mission  at the same time to reach an understanding with the Government on the \nimpact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  estimates,  financing,  implementing  arrangements,  and  the \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference for the proposed technical assistance (TA). The design and \nmonitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Energy  is  a  vital  input  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  India.  The \nGovernment has confirmed its mission, \u201cPower for All by 2012\u201d, to provide all households with \nelectricity at an affordable price by 2012. This mission has been elaborated into subsector \npolicies in the National Electricity Policy, 2005, in accordance with the Electricity Act, 2003.  \n \n3.  The magnitude of investment needed to achieve the goal is vast. Current energy needs \nare primarily met by fossil fuels, the increased consumption of which has negative economic \nand environmental impacts. Historically, the Indian power sector has coal as the predominant \nfuel source of power and hydro power is the next important source. By depending on fossil fuels, \nIndia is exposed to price and supply fluctuations that undermine its national energy security, as \nwell as global and regional energy security, considering India\u2019s large and rapidly growing energy \nconsumption share. Furthermore, the combustion of fossil fuels produces large amounts of \ngreenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  thereby  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  contributing  to \nclimate change.  \n \n4.  Cognizant of these issues, the Government set out the Integrated Energy Policy (IEP) in \nAugust  2006  with  a  view  to  reliably  meet  the  demand  of  all  sectors  for  safe,  clean,  and \nconvenient energy services in a technically efficient, economically viable, and environmentally \nsustainable manner. The IEP prescribes specific measures including (i) optimizing the power \nsupply mix through greater use of indigenous hydropower resources and renewable energy, (ii) \npursuing technologies that maximize energy efficiency, and (iii) continuing related power sector \nreforms to control technical and commercial losses.     \n \n5.  Among the measures, energy efficiency enhancement in the power supply side is one of \nthe most critical challenges in terms of reducing GHG emission. In addition, to bridge the gap \nbetween demand and supply, especially in the context of limited financial resources, it has \nbecome imperative to look for optimum utilization of existing installed generation capacity as \ncontinuous deterioration  in  the  performance  of  thermal  power  stations  had  been  observed \nduring the early 1980s.  \n \n6.  In  this  regard,  renovation  and  modernization  (R&M)  schemes  for  improving  the \nperformance of existing power stations were drawn and executed. Before the IEP was set out, \nthe Government had launched phase I of an R&M program in 1984 for implementation during \nthe 7th plan period as a centrally sponsored scheme. The program covered 163 thermal units \n(13,570 megawatts) in 34 selected power stations. The program was completed in  1991\u20131992 \nwith assistance from the central financial institutions.  \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 August 2007. \n \n ", "2   \n \n7.  Encouraged by the results achieved and urged by the IEP, R&M phase II of the program \nis presently in progress. The total estimated cost of these works is $600 million. Most of the \nstate electricity boards (SEBs) and other generating agencies are facing financial constraints to \ncarry out R&M activities. Therefore, the priority area has to be arranging financial assistance \nand applying clean development mechanism (CDM) to make the R&M projects financially viable. \nThe Government has mandated the  Power Finance Corporation (PFC) to give  state power \nutilities assistance in preparing CDM projects. PFC was set up in July 1986 as a financial \ninstitution dedicated to power sector financing and committed to the integrated development of \nthe power and associated sectors.  \n  \n8.  Despite  the  national  initiatives,  the  state  utilities  planning  R&M  projects  that  are \npotentially CDM eligible face several challenges. First, there are no approved methodologies \napplicable for most of the planned R&M projects partly because demonstrating additionality2 is \ndifficult compared with green field projects. Second, many of the planned projects are relatively \nsmaller than the endorsed projects and the transaction costs will be high if the smaller projects  \nare processed independently. Third, the capacities of state utilities need to be further developed \nin terms of (i) project conceptualization to judge if a project they will undertake will be eligible for \nCDM, (ii) financial projection to properly value the certified emission reduction (CER) revenue \nstream in carbon purchase transactions, (iii) preparation of project idea notes and project design \ndocuments  (PDDs),  and  (iv)  interactions  with  the  designated  national  authority  and  other \nstakeholders. Therefore, provision of a TA to address these aspects will support the initiative.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA aims to assist state utilities in preparing CDM-eligible energy efficiency projects \nin the thermal and hydro power generation sector, which will enhance efficiency rates and \nreduce GHG emission of the existing power plants; and in replacing old units with more efficient \nnew units. \n \n10.  In addition, the TA will provide assistance to non-CDM R&M and replacement projects. \nAlthough such non-CDM projects  may not contribute in meeting the Kyoto targets, they can still \nget  benefits  from  carbon  trading.  Such  projects  generate  credits  called  verified  emission \nreductions (VERs), which can be sold in voluntary carbon markets. The TA will also include \nassistance for carbon benefits in green energy generation projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will identify the pilot state utilities through the screening process for  CDM- \neligible projects and help design, process, and implement the projects. With the implementation \nof the TA, capacity development programs, e.g., CDM technical workshops, for the pilot state \nutilities and others will be conducted. The TA will be implemented in close coordination with \nactivities under ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative (CMI) and the Energy Efficiency Initiative (EEI) \nto ensure no duplication and maximize synergy. The key activities are the following.        \n \n                                                 \n2 The concept of additionality was introduced in the Kyoto Protocol in Article 12.5, which states that emission \nreductions resulting from each project activity shall be certified by DOEs on the basis of reductions in emissions \nthat are additional to any that would occur in the absence of the certified project activity.  \n ", "  3\n(i)  Project identification. Help the state utilities assess CDM and VERs eligibilities \nfor the planned R&M projects.   \n(ii)  Project development. Assist in conducting preliminary screening of projects\u2019 \nCDM potential to assess projects\u2019 eligibility under CDM rules, conducting due \ndiligence on clean energy projects potentially eligible under  CDM rules, and \nsupporting  state  utilities  in  drafting  PDDs  and  new  baseline  and  monitoring \nmethodologies if required. \n(iii)  Validation  and  registration.  Help  project  developers  obtain  host  country \napprovals and validation of PDDs from the designated operational entity (DOE) \nand have them registered with the CDM Executive Board. \n(iv)  Monitoring  CDM  implementation  progress  during  project \nfinancing/construction. Monitor the implementation of project milestones as \nspecified in the PDD and the specific CDM methodology used, as agreed upon \nwith ADB. \n(v)  CDM data monitoring. Monitor data as specified in the PDD, and as described \nin the monitoring methodology of the specific CDM methodology used. \n(vi)  Verification and certification. Assist state utilities to meet the requirements for  \nvalidation and certification by the DOE. Provide technical guidance to meet the \nrequirements of the DOE and the CDM Executive Board. \n(vii)  Issuance and transfer of CERs. Assist state utilities to meet the requirements \nfor the issuance and transfer of CERs. \n(viii)  Issuance of VERs. Assist state utilities to acquire VERs for CDM non-eligible \nprojects.  \n(ix)  Workshop.  Hold  a  workshop  to  disseminate  best  practices  to  relevant \nstakeholders.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,300,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $1,000,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding  program.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $300,000  equivalent  in  kind \nthrough the provision of administrative setup, including office space, office equipment, and local \ntransportation. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  PFC will be the Executing Agency (EA) and the pilot state utilities will be implementing \nagencies (IAs) for the TA. The utilities will be identified by PFC and ADB. PFC and the IAs will \nprovide office space and local telephone access, and will help the TA consultants identify \nspecific counterparts and facilitate data gathering in state utilities. The TA consultants will \norganize the workshops and an international seminar, if necessary, which will be designed in \ncoordination with PFC, IAs and other multilateral and bilateral development partners. The TA \nwill be implemented over 18 months, from 1 January 2008 to 31 June 2009.  \n \n14.  A project implementation unit will be located in the office of PFC, which will assign a \nsenior staff member as the project manager and a PFC counterpart team to work with the TA \nconsultants.  The  project  manager  will  regularly  monitor  the  consultants\u2019  work,  in  close \ncoordination  with  ADB.  PFC  will nominate  the  project  manager  and  establish  the  steering \ncommittee before the TA consultants are mobilized and fielded. The team leader of the TA \nconsultants  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  between  the  consultants,  the \nGovernment, ADB, and the steering committee. \n ", "4   \n \n15.  The TA will require a consulting team of international and national consultants. About 8 \nperson-months  of  international  and  110  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  are \nenvisaged. The international consultants should have extensive experience in CDM policy, \nregulatory practices, and market development. They should have demonstrated expertise in the \nareas of (i) power sector CDM project development and processing, (ii) project-level financial \nand  economic  analyses,  and  (iii)  institutional  development.  International  consultants  will \ncollaborate  with  and  supplement  the  skills  of  national  consultants,  who  will  have  similar \nexpertise and be familiar with Indian power sector conditions and institutional structures. The \noutline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  in  Appendix  3.  ADB  will  engage  a \nconsulting firm or a consortium of firms in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be recruited following the \nsubmission of full technical proposals under the quality- and cost-based selection method. The \nstandard quality-cost ratio of 80:20 will be applied. Procurement of any equipment under the TA \nwill follow ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented in close coordination with activities under the two initiatives \n(CMI and EEI) to ensure no duplication and to maximize synergy through close consultation \nfrom project identification to implementation. The consultants will also work closely with other \ndevelopment partners, e.g., the World Bank, to ensure that all works are fully complementary. If \nother partners are developing a new methodology applicable to the planned R&M project, the \nconsultants will fully share the information in preparing PDDs, if appropriate. The consultants \nwill submit an inception report (a detailed work program with a specific timetable for important \ntasks), an interim report, and a draft final report by the end of months 1, 6, and 14, respectively, \nafter  their  services  start.  Other  deliverable  reports  will  be  submitted  in  accordance  with \nmilestones to be confirmed when the TA starts. The consultants will prepare monthly status and \nprogress reports for the specific scopes of work. Tripartite meetings among representatives from \nPFC, ADB, and the  consultants will be held in India to discuss the inception, interim, and draft \nfinal reports. Within 1 month of the tripartite meeting for the draft final report, the consultants will \nsubmit  a  final  report,  incorporating  comments  received  from  the  Government  and  ADB. \nEstablishing an advance payment facility for PFC, if necessary, will be considered . This facility, \nif appropriate, will be administered by PFC.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for Energy Efficiency Enhancement in the Power Generation Sector, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data  Assumptions and \nTargets/Indicators  Sources/Monitoring  Risks \nMechanism \nImpact       Assumptions \nEfficient reduction of  \u2022  Reduction in rate of  \u2022  Annual GHG  \u2022  Political and \nGHGs through  GHG emissions at  inventory reports;  socioeconomic \nimplementation of CDM  national level and in  enterprise-level  conditions remain \nprojects in India  selected states  inventory reports   stable. \n    \u2022   Economic growth \n\u2022  Tons of CO   \u2022  CDM monitoring and  in the region is \n2\nequivalent emission  verification report   stable. \nreduction achieved    Risks \ndue to project  \u2022   International  and \nimplementation   regional \n  dialogues on \nclimate change \naction collapse. \n\u2022  There are project \ndelays.  \nOutcome      Assumption \nIncreased number of  \u2022  Completion of R&M  \u2022  Associated  \u2022  Clean energy is \nclean energy CDM- phase 2 program with  assessments,  on Central and \neligible projects in the  CERs and VERs   reports, review  state \nIndia power sector     missions, and  governments\u2019 \n  \u2022  Strengthened  policy dialogue.  development \ncapacity of 3\u20137 state    agendas. \nutilities    Risks \n\u2022  The Project is \ndelayed.  \n\u2022   CERs and VERs \nmarkets fluctuate. \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
