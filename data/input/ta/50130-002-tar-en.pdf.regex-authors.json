The transaction technical assistance (TA) will build climate resilience in the hydropower \ninvestment planning process for better management of climate vulnerability, associated risks, and \nenvironmental sustainability. The TA will (i) provide analytical works to assess engineering options \nfor a climate-smart hydropower design that can adapt to projected climate change risks, (ii) \nestablish climate resilience assessment criteria and guidelines, (iii) filter projects and develop a \nhydropower  development  master  plan,  and  (iv)  build  climate  resilience  expertise  into  the \ninstitutional and policy landscape to improve climate change risk management in Uzbekistan. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The Uzbek economy grew robustly at an average rate of 8.4% from 2007 to 2016 but is \nprojected to slow to an average of 5.0% because of external shocks. The energy sector has \nplayed a critical role in underpinning Uzbekistan\u2019s sustained growth, contributing 10% of the \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product and 25% of exports. However, Uzbekistan is also one of the \nmost energy-intensive countries in the world. Its aging and dilapidated Soviet-era energy and \nindustrial infrastructure is a major factor behind poor energy efficiency. The lack of adequate \ninvestments in new power plants across the energy value chain is inhibiting the retirement of old \npower plants and worsening energy efficiency. \n \n3.  Uzbekistan is rich in hydrocarbon resources, with large proven reserves of about 1.8 trillion \ncubic meters of natural gas, 600 million barrels of oil, and 3 billion tons of coal. The primary energy \nconsumption in Uzbekistan is dominated by natural gas, which provides 82% of its energy mix.1 \nUzbekistan is the eighth-largest producer of natural gas in the world. In 2016, it produced more \nthan 62 billion cubic meters of natural gas, of which 20% was exported. Natural gas also \ndominates the country\u2019s electricity generation mix, contributing 86% of total electricity produced \nin 2017. High reliance on natural gas, compounded by energy inefficiency, has led to (i) missed \nopportunities for higher-value natural gas exports, (ii) limited system reliability and inefficient load \nmanagement, and (iii) high carbon emission and increased vulnerability to long-term unavailability \nof natural gas. \n \n4.  To tackle challenges, Uzbekistan\u2019s energy policy has been shifting toward low greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emission pathways, emphasizing improved energy efficiency and the deployment of \nrenewable resources, with an ambitious target to double the share of renewable energy by 2030. \nAs part of this initiative, Uzbekistan has adopted a $2.6 billion investment program to modernize \nand construct hydropower plants (HPPs) from 2017 to 2025.2 In 2017, installed hydropower \ngeneration capacity totaled 1,883.8 megawatts of the 12,000.0-megawatt hydropower potential, \ncontributing 13.0% of total electricity generation capacity and 15.8% of the total available supply. \nSuccessful implementation of the program is expected to increase hydropower capacity by 1.6 \ngigawatts by 2030. \n \n5.  With a two-pronged strategy of (i) shifting to a low GHG emission energy system through \nthe development of indigenous hydropower resources and (ii) serving the competing water-use \ndemand in various economic sectors, the government established the Joint-Stock Company \n                                                \n1  Oil (10%), hydropower (5%), and coal (3%) are the other sources in the energy mix. \n2  Government of Uzbekistan. 2017. Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan on the Program of \nMeasures for Further Development of Hydropower Energy for 2017\u20132021. No. PP-2947. Tashkent. 2 May. \n ", "2 \nUzbekhydroenergo. Uzbekhydroenergo was formed by merging the HPPs of Uzbekenergo, a \nvertically integrated electricity utility, and Uzsuvenergo, a hydropower company under the Ministry \nof  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources.3  The  government\u2019s  massive  hydropower  investment \nprogram is led by Uzbekhydroenergo. \n \n6.  Large  deployment  of  hydropower  is  seen  as  an  effective  GHG  emission  mitigation \nstrategy. However, a significant portion of the country\u2019s water resources comes from mountains \nin neighboring countries, where glaciers supply most of the region\u2019s river runoff. Hydropower, \nparticularly run-of-river technology without little or no reserve capacity, is vulnerable to climate \nchange-associated decrease in river flows and reduction in water availability. If not carefully \nconsidered during planning and design, water supply issues could affect the production of \nelectricity from HPPs. \n \n7.  Besides  its  adverse  impact  on  electricity generation,  the climate-change  associated \ndecrease in accessibility to water resources could worsen the country\u2019s water-stressed situation. \nHence, in addition to power generation, investments to increase water storage capacity and \nmultipurpose dams will be further promoted as a climate change adaptation measure to provide \nwater  security  for  drinking,  irrigation,  and  disaster  control.  To  prevent  risks  to  the  overall \nsustainability of watersheds and the environment from worsening, the design and construction of \nhydropower projects should be effectively aligned with the country\u2019s energy and water needs. \n \n8.  The government\u2019s hydropower investment plan is largely based on Soviet-era climate and \nhydrological data without consideration of international climate resilience guidelines. Given the \nchallenges  of  climate  variability  and  projected  long-term  reduction  in  water  availability  in \nUzbekistan, incorporating practical climate-resilience provisions into the hydropower planning \nprocess will ensure the technical and economical soundness of long-standing investments. In \naddition, given the significant investment needs to develop hydropower projects, catalyzing \nprivate  sector  investments  in  hydropower  and  exploring  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP) \narrangement for financing of hydropower projects are essential. \n \n9.  This transaction TA, which is attached to the Sustainable Hydropower Project, will help \nfacilitate the implementation of the government\u2019s hydropower development strategy and address \nclimate change challenges that may constrain long-term investments. In particular, the TA will \nfacilitate the preparation of a hydropower development master plan to review and rationalize the \ngovernment\u2019s investment plan. The master plan will also explore climate-resilient pathways for \nhydropower development, with greater emphasis on flexibility and climate-smart options that \nperform well under uncertainty. Equivalent efforts will be made to infuse climate resilience into \nenergy policy, regulation, and planning to make them climate smart. \n \n10.  The TA project\u2019s impacts, which are aligned with government strategies to lower GHG \nemissions (footnote 2), will be increased reliable energy supply, reduced GHG emissions, and \nimproved  sustainability  of  the  energy  sector. The  outcome  will  be  sustainable  hydropower \ngeneration in Uzbekistan increased. The project is in the country operations business plan, 2019\u2013\n2021 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Uzbekistan,4 and the TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 priorities to mitigate climate change and enhance environmental sustainability.5 \n                                                \n3  Government of Uzbekistan. 2017.

Output 1: Climate resilience promoted in hydropower planning. Output 1 will finance \nthe analytical works and integration of climate resilience in the hydropower development master \nplan through the following key activities: (i) reviewing and assessing hydropower in Uzbekistan \nand  its  long-term  development  plan  with  emphasis  on  resilience  to  climate  change  and \nenvironmental sustainability; (ii) formulating project selection criteria and assessment tools, taking \ntechnical, financial, environmental, and socioeconomic characteristics and climate resilience into \naccount; (iii) conducting due diligence on the planned hydropower projects and developing a \nhydropower sector master plan based on the selection criteria; and (iv) conducting stakeholder \nconsultations  and  workshops  to  disseminate  the  outcome  and  knowledge.  During  TA \nimplementation, cooperation with neighboring countries will be sought under the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation Program with possible expansion into a regional cooperation \nagenda. \n \n12.  The master plan will also identify short-term priority investment projects that are urgently \nneeded to improve the reliability of power supply, which will eventually be included in the \ngovernment\u2019s investment plan and offered to private sector investments. To this end, early-stage \ndue diligence reports, including stakeholder consultations, will be prepared under the master plan, \nincluding exploration of the PPP modality. \n \n13.  Output 2: Institutional capacity in climate resilience enhanced. Output 2 will build \ncapacity to mainstream climate resilience into the institutional and policy landscape throughout \nthe implementation of the TA and the preparation of the master plan. The institutional capacity of \nUzbekhydroenergo, along with other related agencies, in planning and implementing hydropower \nprojects will be enhanced to keep the master plan updated and relevant. This output will also help \nbroaden  staff  understanding  on  new  technologies,  climate-smart  hydropower  design,  and \nimportant issues affecting water\u2013energy security. Exploration of PPPs will strengthen the capacity \nof the government and Uzbekhydroenergo in structuring PPP projects, allocating risks, and \ndeveloping templates for various contractual arrangements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.7 million, of which (i) $1.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Climate Change Fund6 and (ii) $0.5 million will be financed on a grant basis by the \nClean Energy Fund7 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and administered by \nADB. Eligible expenditures include consulting services, training and workshops, and equipment. \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n15.
