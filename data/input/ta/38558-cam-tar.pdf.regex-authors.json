INTRODUCTION \n1.  This  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  paper  combines  two  related \nactivities proposed for the water resources sector in Cambodia.   \n \n(i)  In 2004, the Government of Cambodia requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to (a) prepare a feasibility study for an \nirrigation and water resources development (sector) project, and (b) help the \nGovernment  to  strengthen  its  capacity  to  manage  its  water  resources  in  a \nsustainable, participatory, and transparent way. In April 2006, the Fact-Finding \nMission  of  ADB  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  visited \nCambodia to formulate parts A and B of the PPTA.  \n(ii)  In  2003,  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  provide  TA  to  investigate  how \ninfrastructure development and natural resources management in the Tonle Sap \nbasin could be better driven, coordinated, and streamlined. In response, ADB \nprovided two TA projects to design and plan the development of an institutional \nframework for integrated basin planning and management.1,2 In February 2006, \nthe ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Cambodia and formulated part C of the \nPPTA to continue this activity, in line with the Tonle Sap Initiative.3  \n \n2.  The  Government  has  agreed  with  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, and cost and financing arrangements for the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1, and an initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Cambodia has more than 1,000 irrigation schemes with a potential command area of \nabout 437,000 ha. However, only about 55% of the schemes are considered operational. In the \nCambodian context, irrigation largely involves the management of floodwaters in recession. \nIrrigation schemes are typically designed to supplement rainfall at the start and/or end of the \nrainy season, and to divert Mekong river water to adjacent farmlands during the dry season. \nMultiple cropping systems are uncommon. The sustainability of investments in the irrigation \nsector is a concern, and the Government is keen to improve irrigation-system performance, \nundertake rehabilitation, and promote beneficiary participation in operation and maintenance \n(O&M). Investments in irrigation are critical to (i) stabilize and increase rice production, (ii) \nreduce farmers\u2019 susceptibility to droughts and floods, (iii) ensure food security, (iv) encourage \nagricultural diversification, and (v) move into higher value-added crops.  \n \n4.  The  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  and  National  Strategic  Development  Plan \n(NSDP)  identify  the  water  sector  as  a  key  contributor  to  poverty  reduction  in  Cambodia, \nprimarily through its contribution to (i) improved rural livelihoods, food security, and nutrition \nthrough better water management in agriculture and fisheries; (ii) improved access to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation; (iii) improved disaster prevention measures; and (iv) sustained \nconservation of aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity for the benefit of future generations. The \nNSDP aims to expand irrigated areas from around 20% currently to 25% of the total rice area by \n2010. Reaching this target will require rehabilitating existing irrigation schemes and supporting \ncost-effective  private  irrigation  technologies.  Later,  as  institutional  capacity  for  sustainable \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

In recent years, the Government has progressed steadily in establishing a legal and \npolicy  framework  for  the  water  sector.  The  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology \n(MOWRAM) was set up in 1999. The National Water Resources Policy was approved in early \n2004. The Law on Water Resources Management was approved by the Council of Ministers in \n2005, and is currently before the National Assembly for approval. Draft regulations have been \nprepared for (i) river basin management and planning, and (ii) water allocation and basin \nmanagement. MOWRAM, with ADB\u2019s assistance, is finalizing its Strategic Development Plan \n(SDP),5 which was prepared in line with the Rectangular Strategy and NSDP. Elements of the \nSDP are being incorporated into the Medium Term Strategy for Agriculture and Water (MTSAW, \n2006\u20132010), currently under development by the Technical Working Group for Agriculture and \nWater Resources. The SDP\u2019s institutional goal is to strengthen MOWRAM\u2019s capacity to (i) \nimplement  water-related  legislation  and  policy;  (ii)  improve  water  resources  information \nmanagement; and (iii) develop its administration, management, and human resources.  \n \n6.  The legal and policy framework promotes sustainable water resources planning and \nmanagement in a river basin context. Through the adoption of integrated water resources \nmanagement (IWRM), water will be used to achieve the greatest net economic and social \nbenefit. IWRM aims to prevent conflict and competition by creating an environment conducive to \nsatisfying  present  and  foreseeable  demands.  However,  the  policy  has  yet  to  be  fully \nimplemented and further resources and institutional capacity building are needed.  \n \n7.  The Government is promoting a participatory irrigation management and development \n(PIMD) policy to increase water user participation in managing irrigation schemes. MOWRAM \nhas issued prakas (regulations) to transfer irrigation management from the Government to \nfarmers and to increase participatory management. Under this approach, the O&M costs of \nirrigation schemes are shared between the Government and beneficiary communities. However, \nimplementation of this policy varies widely between provinces, districts, and schemes. To date, \nthis policy has produced mixed results.  \n \n8.  Both ADB and AFD have had considerable involvement in the sector. Since 1999, ADB\u2019s \nassistance has included two loans cofinanced with AFD for irrigation development6,7 and one \nloan for rehabilitation of irrigation and flood-control infrastructure.8 ADB has also facilitated in \ndeveloping the legal and policy framework for the water resource and irrigation sector.9 The \nNorthwest Irrigation Sector Project (NWISP, footnote 7) continues to assist in developing policy \nand  the  strategic  framework,  promoting  inter-agency  cooperation,  IWRM  approach  in  river \nbasins, and regulatory framework for irrigation management transfer.  \n \n9.  Since 1996, the Government has been implementing a program of decentralization and \ndeconcentration  that  promotes  increased  local-government  and  community  involvement  in \nnatural  resources  planning  and  management.  In  2003,  CNMC  began  encouraging  local \n                                                 \n5  Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology. 2006.

Two TA projects (footnotes 1 and 2) \nwere implemented against this backdrop in 2004 and 2005, and an agreement was reached on \nthe  model  for  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin  Management  Organization  (TSBMO).  This  activity \ncomplements the loan, grant, and TA projects under the ADB-assisted Tonle Sap Initiative.10  \n \nIII.  THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The PPTA will assist the Government to prepare an investment project to increase \nirrigation productivity and area and to implement irrigation management transfer (IMT) to meet \nits NSDP goals. It will also assist MOWRAM to successfully implement the non-investment \naspects of its SDP. Similarly, the PPTA will support the establishment of TSBMO and the \nprocess  of  IWRM,  following  the  recommendations  of  the  TA  project  Establishment  of  the \nTSBMO II (footnote 2) under the Tonle Sap Initiative. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The project is designed to support the Government\u2019s NSDP target of reducing poverty in \nselected rural areas through enhanced agricultural production and diversification. In line with the \nNational  Water  Resources  Policy  and  MOWRAM\u2019s  SDP,  the  PPTA  will  strengthen  the \nGovernment's  capacity  to  manage  water  resources  in  a  sustainable,  participatory,  and \ntransparent way, focusing on improving irrigation facilities and river subbasin management \nwithin the Tonle Sap basin.11 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The PPTA will have three components: (i) part A, investment project preparation; (ii) part \nB, capacity strengthening for MOWRAM; and (iii) part C, establishment of TSBMO (Phase III).  \n \n13.  Part A: investment project preparation will focus on preparing an investment project, \nsuitable for possible ADB and AFD cofinancing, that aims to increase incomes in rural areas \nthrough irrigated agriculture, and builds on the experience of the ongoing NWISP. Based on a \ndetailed study of representative core subprojects, the PPTA will prepare a 6-year program of \nsmall and medium-scale irrigation systems covering a target area of about 20,000 ha.12 ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program (CSP) has programmed a loan of $20 million for approval in 2008, \nand  AFD  is  considering  cofinancing  the  project  with  a  grant  of  \u20ac8  million  ($10.2  million \nequivalent). \n  \n14.  The investment project will emphasize a participatory, process-oriented, and integrated \napproach to irrigation and water resources development, focusing on the agricultural context. \nThe aim will be to establish sustainable farmer water user groups and communities (FWUGs, \nFWUCs)  and  to  strengthen  MOWRAM\u2019s  capacity  to  operate  and  maintain  larger  system \nfacilities. Project implementation will be managed through MOWRAM\u2019s provincial offices and \nclosely  linked  to  agricultural  support  services  to  be  provided  by  the  provincial and  district \nextension staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF). The investment \nproject will provide capacity building for MOWRAM and MAFF staff at provincial and district \nlevels. Agricultural extension activities, as well as establishment of FWUCs, will begin well \nbefore the design and construction of civil works, and continue after the construction has been \n                                                 \n10  The Tonle Sap Initiative is a partnership of organizations and people working to meet the poverty and environment \nchallenges of the Tonle Sap based on the Tonle Sap basin strategy. \n11 The proposed investment project may also include minor activities to monitor or support components of ongoing \nprojects funded by ADB or AFD outside the Tonle Sap basin. \n12 Including full control irrigation and flood spreading and/or recession agriculture. \n ", "4   \ncompleted. Experience indicates that early participation by water users in scheme development \nand management improves the chances of successful IMT, and long-term support of agricultural \nextension activities is essential to promote sustainable project outcomes. \n \n15.  Two river subbasins and four core subprojects will be identified and subproject feasibility \nstudies undertaken. As with the NWISP, the activities will include (i) subbasin identification and \nselection; (ii) a participatory approach to prepare long lists of potential subprojects involving the \nprovincial rural development committee prioritization process, the views of beneficiaries, and the \nviews of other ministries such as MAFF; (iii) development of social, economic, technical, and \ninstitutional selection criteria, similar to NWISP, to identify core subprojects and the mix of \nsmall-  and  medium-scale  activities;  (iv)  feasibility  studies  of  at  least  four  core  subprojects \ninvolving  engineering  and  agricultural  data  collection,  feasibility  design,  and  economic  and \nenvironmental analysis; (v) and the design of a sector investment project incorporating the \nselection principles and strategies developed in the PPTA and promoting project readiness. \n \n16.  Part B: capacity strengthening for MOWRAM will strengthen MOWRAM\u2019s capacity to \nimplement  its  SDP  and  its  commitments  under  the  MTSAW,  and  to  execute  its  statutory \nresponsibilities, building on initiatives begun under NWISP. This part of the PPTA will involve (i) \nimproving the planning of investments in water resources to maximize their contribution to the \nGovernment\u2019s  social  and  environmental  goals,  and  (ii)  providing  specific  assistance  to \nMOWRAM in the areas of (a) water resources information management; (b) benefit monitoring \nand evaluation; (c) strategic and annual planning; and (d) financial and budget management \n(including O&M financing) to achieve selected SDP goals, objectives, and activities. \n \n17.  Part C: establishment of TSBMO (phase III) will establish a Tonle Sap basin coordinating \ncommittee (TSBCC) within the Cambodian National Mekong Committee (CNMC)13 following the \nrecommendations of the TA for TSBMO Phase II (footnote 2),14 to (i) provide coordinated water \nsector and related resources planning, (ii) facilitate stakeholder and community participation, \nand (iii) provide information on water sector and related resources. This TA will review, revise, \nrecommend, and establish the structure, membership, and operating protocol for the TSBCC \nsecretariat. Subbasin committees, provincial water sector and related resources committees, \nand  district  taskforces  will  be  established  in  Battambang,  Kompong  Chhnang  and  Pursat \nprovinces to provide the necessary links to decentralized and deconcentrated administrative \nlevels.  Formal  training  and  on-the-job  experience  on  institution  development,  information \ngathering, strategic planning, inter-province coordination, and valuation analysis will establish a \nwater sector and related resources planning, management, and development process. A follow-\nup TA will advance the road map set out under TSBMO phase I (footnote 1), with emphasis on \nthe development of basin and subbasin plans. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,560,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $1,000,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from its TA funding program. The Government of France will provide \n$300,000 equivalent.15 The Government of Cambodia will finance $260,000 equivalent through \nthe provision of counterpart staff and per diem payments, office space in Phnom Penh and \nBattambang,  data,  administration  and  clerical  services,  and  communications.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed \nthat approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB or AFD to finance any ensuing project. \n                                                 \n13 CNMC has a membership of 10 ministries and a link to the Mekong River Commission. Together with MOWRAM, it \nis responsible for promoting basin planning and management. The Minister of Water Resources and Meteorology is \ncurrently the chairperson of CNMC. \n14 See the final report of November 2005 and its working papers of July 2005. \n15 The Government of France funds, blended with ADB\u2019s funds, will be used to finance parts A and B of the TA. \n ", "  5\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will be undertaken over 18 months. Part A will run from January to December \n2007, and parts B and C will run from November 2006 to April 2008. MOWRAM, through its \nProject Management Office, will be the Executing Agency, and it will be the Implementing \nAgency for parts A and B. CNMC will be the Implementing Agency for part C. The national \nProject  Steering  Committee  (PSC)  for  water  resources  development16 will  provide  overall \nguidance to the TA. The Project Management Office will assign a TA director and a full-time \nproject manager for part A when the TA Agreement is signed. At least one full-time counterpart \nstaff from MOWRAM will be assigned to work with each consultant under part B for the duration \nof their inputs. MOWRAM will provide suitable office space (including telephone and Internet \nconnections) for the consultant team and counterparts in Battambang, Kompong Chhnang, and \nPursat for parts A and C, and in Phnom Penh for part B. CNMC will provide suitable office \nspace in Phnom Penh for part C.  \n \n20.  An international consulting firm in association with national consultants will be engaged \nunder part A using a simplified technical proposal under quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures  to  provide  19  person-months  international  and  24  person-months  national \nconsulting  services  with  expertise  in  water  resources  management,  sociology,  irrigation \norganizations,  poverty  reduction,  agricultural/natural  resources  economics,  irrigation, \nagriculture,    resettlement,  environment,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  irrigation  management \ntransfer  and  geographical  information  systems.  Part  B  requires  12  person-months  of \ninternational and 12 person-months of national individually recruited consulting services with \nexpertise in water resource policy and planning, benefit monitoring and evaluation, financial and \ninstitutional  management  and  data  management.  Part  C  requires  5  person-months  of \ninternational and 16 person-months of national individually recruited consulting services with \nexpertise  in  river  basin  management,  water  resources  management,  and  institutional \ndevelopment. ADB will recruit the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Workshops will be organized at key stages of the TA project to promote awareness \nand encourage stakeholder participation. Equipment, training, workshops and surveys will be \nprocured or organized by ADB or by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines. Outline terms of reference are given in Appendix 4. \n \n21.  As also described in Appendix 4, part A consultants will submit (i) an inception report, (ii) \ntwo progress reports, (iii) a draft final report, and (v) a final TA report. Tripartite meetings will be \nheld after the submission of the first and second progress reports and the draft final report, and \nADB and AFD will jointly review the progress of the PPTA during its implementation. Part A \nconsultants will be required to assist on a loan fact-finding mission. Parts B and C consultants \nwill prepare inception reports, progress reports, and working papers. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.

The NPRS provides a comprehensive set of monitoring indicators towards achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) that have been integrated into a number of national and sector strategies. The \nPoverty Reduction Partnership Agreement (PRPA) was signed in July 2002. To overcome barriers to poverty \nreduction in line with SEDP II, NPRS and the Rectangular Strategy, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has focused \nits country strategy and program (CSP) (2004) on (i) fostering broad-based economic growth, (ii) improving livelihoods \nand reducing vulnerability, and (iii) improving governance at all levels. In particular, the CSP is targeting a broad-\nbased and inclusive development process to include increasing agriculture productivity and diversification, and \ntargeting poverty interventions in a limited geographic area (the Tonle Sap basin) to maximize the number of \nbeneficiaries and thereby improve the development impact of ADB's assistance. \n \n \nB.
