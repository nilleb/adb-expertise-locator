It will enable people\nto  rebuild,  to  resume  their  normal  lives  by  restoring\navailability of basic services such as drinking water and\nelectricity,  provide  housing  to  mitigate  homelessness,\nand foster economic opportunities.\nClassification Poverty: Poverty Intervention\nThematic: Economic Growth\nEnvironmental Assessment Category B\nRationale The  intensity  of  the  earthquake  resulted  in  a  major\ncatastrophy with severe impact on the local population.\nThe quake, which was the worst on record for the past\nhalf century, caused more than 19,000 confirmed deaths,\nabout 200,000 injured and up to 1.7 million homeless. In\naddition, the quake completely destroyed 300,000 and\ndamaged more than 600,000 dwelling units and much of\nthe power, water supply, and sanitation systems in the\naffected areas.\nBecause  the  quake\u2019s  epicenter  was  in  the  Kachchh\ndistrict  of  Gujarat,  the  impact  on  people\u2019s  lives  and\neconomic activity was even greater, as this was the fifth\nmajor disaster to strike the northeastern part of Gujarat in\nthe past four years. The four preceding events include\ntwo cyclones and two severe droughts, the second of\nwhich  is  still  causing  major  distress  to  the  poorest\nregions in the state. Therefore, the economic resilience\nof the Government of Gujarat (GOG) and civil society\nwere already depleted and the estimated $2.3 billion cost\nof  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  basic  services,\ntogether  with  the  further  $1  billion-$1.5  billion  of\neconomic damage due to loss of production and lower\nfiscal revenues, would be impossible for the state to bear\nwithout assistance. By providing financing for the most\nurgently needed components and works, the loan will\nenable  GOG  to  finance  a  portion  of  the  overall\nreconstruction program, as well as help to restore the\neconomic activity essential for survival of residents in the\nheavily affected areas.\nObjectives and Scope The main objective of the Project is to support GOG\u2019s\nefforts to reconstruct and restore essential infrastructure\ndamaged in the affected areas of the State, especially", "ii\nthe  Jamnagar,  Kachchh,  Patan,  Rajkot,  and\nSurendranagar districts. This is essential to enable early\nrestoration of economic and social activity in the affected\nareas, especially for the poor. The Project will focus on\nthe highest priority areas, identified through consultations\nwith  GOG,  public  and  private  sector,  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), and other civil society.\nThe Project will have the following parts.\nPart A: Housing. Assistance will be for reconstruction of\nresidential  houses,  focusing  on  rural  areas  and  the\npoorer sections of the population.\nPart B: Urban and Rural Infrastructure. Work will focus\non urban and rural water supply, sewerage, sanitation,\ndrainage,  civic  buildings,  staff  quarters,  electrification,\nand lighting; and the development of sites and services.\nPart  C:  Power.  Substations,  transmission  lines,\ndistribution  systems,  staff  quarters,  administrative  and\nrelated buildings, switch gear and transformers, control\nsystems and related equipment will be rehabilitated.\nPart  D:  Livelihood  Rehabilitation.  Support  will  be\nprovided  for  livelihood  projects  that  would  include\nfinancial  and  infrastructure  support  for  skill-based\naffected persons including retraining of affected persons\nneeding alternative line of work and livelihood.\nPart  E:  Consulting  Services  and  Incremental\nAdministrative Support.\nPart  F:  Multihazard  Disaster  Preparedness  and\nMitigation. Support will be provided for preparation of\ndisaster  management  plans,  disaster  management\ninformation systems, and disaster management training. \nCost Estimates The  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $625  million\nequivalent.

It will carry an interest rate determined\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending\nrate system for US dollar loans, and applicable charges.\nThe  Borrower  will  pay  to  ADB  a  front-end  fee  in  an\namount equal to one percent of the loan amount.\nPeriod of Utilization 30 June 2004\nExecuting Agency GOG and Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority\n(GSDMA).\nImplementation Arrangements  Overall coordination and guidance will be provided by\nGSDMA.  GSDMA  will  also  be  responsible  for\ncoordinating  assistance  provided  by  other  multilateral\nand  bilateral  development  institutions,  other  aid  and\ndonor agencies, the private sector, and NGOs. A project\nmanagement and coordination unit (PMCU) will act on\nbehalf of GSDMA as the Executing Agency on routine\nmatters and have decision-making authority to facilitate\nproject implementation. The PMCU in conjunction with\nImplementing  Agencies  (IAs)  and  the  participating\ndistricts,  cities,  and  towns  will  prioritize  and  select\nsubprojects  under  the  Project.  The  PMCU  will  be\nsupported by project management consultants providing\nspecialized technical support and advice on earthquake\nand  other  natural  calamities\u2019  engineering,  financial\nmanagement  and  accounting,  beneficiary  participation,\nbenefit monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building.\nAn  IA  will  be  appointed  for  each  of  the  key  sectors\nincluded  under  the  Project  reporting  to  the  PMCU  of\nGSDMA.  The  prioritization,  technical  preparation,  and\nimplementation of the eligible subprojects will be carried\nout by the respective IAs.  In particular, the Panchayats,\nRural Housing, and Rural Development Department (part\nA);  Gujarat  Urban  Development  Company  and  the\nGujarat  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Board  (part  B);\nGujarat Electricity Board (part C); and the Department of\nSocial Justice and Empowerment and the Industries and\nMines  Department  (part  D)  will  be  the  IAs  for  the\nrespective  project  components.  Part  E  will  entail\nmanagement and technical support to the PMCU and the\nIAs for smooth and efficient implementation including the\ndesign,  procurement,  quality  control,  accounting,\nmonitoring, and reporting requirements for the Project.\nPart F will provide support for establishing an effective\nmultihazard  disaster  preparedness  and  mitigation\nprogram.\nProcurement Procurement of goods and services to be financed by the\nProject  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s", "iv\nGuidelines for Procurement.  Since the value of contracts\nwill be relatively small and scattered over a wide range of\nthe affected areas of Gujarat, they are not likely to attract\ninternational suppliers. The equipment and materials will\nneed to be delivered in as short a time period as possible\ndue to the urgent nature of the Project. The tight delivery\nschedules would be unattractive to international suppliers\nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.\nThese will therefore be procured through international\nshopping for goods not readily available in India, and\nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures  for  goods\nmanufactured in India. This will not preclude international\nsuppliers from bidding through their local outlets.\nConsulting Services and All consultants will be engaged by the PMCU and the IAs\nTechnical Support in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\nfor the engagement of domestic consultants.\nEstimated Project 31 December 2003\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries Considering the extent of damage, the costs of rebuilding\nhouses and infrastructure facilities are exorbitant both for\naffected households and for the state. Support both in\nterms  of  financial  assistance  as  well  as  improved\nearthquake resistant technology will be of considerable\nbenefit in protecting the poor and affected people from\nfalling further into poverty. It will help families resettle,\nprovide a safer and healthier environment, and stabilize\nlivelihoods.\nThe  rehabilitation  of  urban  and  rural  infrastructure,\nparticularly water supply and sanitation, will facilitate the\nprovision of drinking water, reduce risk of health-related\nproblems, and improve the quality of life. Support for\nphysical reconstruction in key sectors like power would\nhave positive secondary effects in reviving industries and\nagriculture.  By  rehabilitating  public  and  community\ninfrastructure, the Project will help restore economic and\nsocial activities disrupted by the disaster.\nThe Project envisages livelihood restoration that could\nhelp prevent the current adverse effects of the disaster\non  the  affected  poor.  Livelihoods  have  been  badly\naffected and this, along with the destruction of household\ninvestments,  has  been  draining  meager  household\nsavings and adversely impacting on levels of income and\ncapability  poverty  in  the  region.  The  possibility  of  an\nadverse  impact  in  terms  of  reduced  consumption,\nmigration, and increased child labor in poor families is\nincreasing.  The  rehabilitation  works  will  entail  labor\nintensive  civil  works  contracts,  using  unskilled  and", "v\nsemiskilled  local  labor,  thereby  providing  employment\nopportunities  for  the  poor.  Livelihood  rehabilitation  for\nlocal artisans, craftsmen, and self-employed people in\nthe  affected  area  will  facilitate  recovery  of  the  local\neconomy, thereby restoring more long-term employment\nopportunities for them. The training envisaged for various\ncategories of skills will help in the economic and social\nrehabilitation  of  the  severely  affected  classes  like  the\nphysically disabled persons and widowed women. The\nbenefits of the Project will be evident through economic\nrehabilitation  arising  from  speedy  reconstruction  of\ninfrastructure and facilities, and livelihood restoration in\nthe earthquake-affected areas.\nProposed Technical Assistance A Technical Assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for\nEarthquake  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  of\nHousing, is proposed to support the State\u2019s Panchayats,\nRural  Housing  and  Rural  Development  Department\n(PRHD) and the Urban Development and Urban Housing\nDepartment  (UDHD)  in  implementing  GOG\u2019s\nreconstruction  program  for  earthquake-damaged\nhousing.\nThe cost of the TA is estimated at $1,650,000 equivalent,\nincluding  $480,000  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and\n$1,170,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will\nprovide $1,300,000 equivalent to fund the entire foreign\nexchange  cost  and  $820,000  equivalent  of  the  local\ncurrency cost on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA\nprogram.  The  Government  and  GOG  will  contribute\n$350,000 equivalent in kind.", "vi", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to India for the Gujarat Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, and (ii)\nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Earthquake Rehabilitation and\nReconstruction of Housing.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. On 26 January 2001, the state of Gujarat was struck by an earthquake of 6.9 magnitude\non the Richter scale (measured by the Indian Meteorological Department (cid:190)  7.7 as measured by\nthe United States [US] Geological Survey). The earthquake(cid:190) the strongest in the region in the\npast half century (cid:190) has caused a large number of fatalities and extensive and widespread\ndamage to physical and social infrastructure. On 29 January 2001, the Government of India (the\nGovernment) requested urgent assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other\nmultilateral  institutions  for  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  affected  areas.  ADB\nresponded promptly by offering the possibility of immediate assistance to Gujarat by reallocating\nproceeds of existing loans and providing a new loan (para. 42). ADB fielded a Mission starting\n12 February 2001 to prepare a proposal for ADB financial assistance.1 The Mission concurrently\nundertook assessment of the earthquake damage as part of the Joint World Bank-ADB Mission,\nwith participation from US Agency for International Development and the Netherlands Embassy\nin Delhi, and prepared a strategy for rehabilitation and reconstruction. Following the conclusion\nof the Joint Mission on 24 February, the ADB Mission completed appraisal of the proposed\nProject on 28 February 2001.\n3. The missions undertook field visits, met with affected people, senior government officials\nat the central and state levels, and representatives of United Nations (UN) Agencies, and\ninteracted with representatives from nongovernment organizations (NGOs), industry, and civil\nsociety at large. This report is based on the findings of the ADB Mission. The proposed ADB\nassistance, with assistance expected from other international and bilateral financing agencies, is\nin accordance with the state government of Gujarat\u2019s (GOG) overall recovery strategy, the time\nframe for assistance, as well as the state\u2019s absorptive capacity.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Natural Disasters in India\n4. With  its  vast  territory  and  varied  geoclimatic  conditions,  the  Indian  subcontinent  is\nexposed to frequent natural calamities, including cyclones, floods, and earthquakes, which\n                                                \n1 The Mission comprised K. Gerhaeusser, Senior Programs Officer, PW2 (Mission Leader); M. Alam, Project\nImplementation Officer, INRM; A. Guha, Project Implementation Officer, INRM; A. Jorgensen, Senior Project\nImplementation Officer, INRM; H. Mukhopadhyay, Economist, INRM; N. Patel, Senior Project Specialist, IWOD;\nV.S. Rekha, Counsel, OGC (24-28 February); V.V. Subramanian, Investment Officer, INRM, 13-22 and 28\nFebruary); S. Vishwanathan, Social Economist, INRM; and J. Weinstock, Senior Poverty Reduction Specialist,\nOESD (12-19 February). Y. Iwasaki, Director, PWD, F. Polman, Resident Representative, INRM, and A. Thapan,\nManager, AWWU held discussions in India during 8-12 February 2001 with officials of the Government of India and\nthe Government of Gujarat (GOG) as well as with the World Bank. R. Nag, Deputy Director, PWD joined the\nMission in meetings with GOG and the Government during 21-24 February. Further assistance was also provided\nby T. Kondo, Manager, IWTC; S. Chander, Senior Project Engineer, IWEN; M. Hamano, Project Engineer, IWEN;\nand V.B. Tulasidhar, until recently Senior Economist in INRM. The Mission was joined by J. Parker, A. Rego, and\nR.

While vulnerability varies from region to region, a large\npart of the country is exposed to these natural hazards, which often cause significant loss of life\nand large-scale destruction of physical infrastructure, and have a long-lasting impact on society.\nOver the past decade, tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions affected by\nsuch disasters.  The worst damage is caused by earthquakes, cyclones, and droughts (Table 1).\nTable 1: Exposure to Natural Disasters in India (1991-2001)\nNumber of Persons\nYear Type Affected (in \u2018000) Killed\n1991 Earthquake 54 1,500\n1992\n1993 (I) Drought 1,175 \u2014\n         (II) Earthquake 166 9,475\n1994 Cyclone 400 208\n1995 Drought \u2014 558\n1996 Cyclone 1,323 1,386\n1997 Earthquake 22 43\n1998 (I) Cyclone 4,661 3,600\n1998 (II) Drought \u2014 2,541\n1999 Drought \u2014 \u2014\n2000 Drought \u2014 \u2014\n2001 (as of 15 Mar) Earthquake 19,660 19,200\n\u2014 = not available.\nSources: Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance; and Center for Research on the Epidemiology of\nDisasters. International Disaster Database.\nB. The Earthquake of 26 January 2001\n5. The massive earthquake, with its epicenter about 20 kilometers (kms) northeast of Bhuj,\nin the district of Kachchh of Gujarat, about 1,140 km from New Delhi, was followed by more than\n300 aftershocks ranging between 3 to 6 on the Richter scale during the subsequent two weeks.\nAlthough the quake was felt throughout most of western, northern, and southern India, the\ndamage was most severe in Kachchh and the adjoining districts of Jamnagar, Patan, Rajkot,\nand Surendranagar. Ahmedabad, the commercial center of Gujarat with a population of about\n5.4 million was also affected. So far, more than 19,200 people have been confirmed dead, with\nthe toll likely to rise above 20,000. Almost 200,000 people were injured, and nearly 20 million\npeople were affected. While roads and bridges sustained only relatively minor damage, other\ninfrastructure services like water supply and sanitation, power transmission and distribution, and\ntelecommunications received extensive damage. Health and education infrastructure was also\nseverely  impacted,  with  hundreds  of  hospitals  and  smaller  health  facilities  damaged  and\nthousands of classrooms destroyed. Moreover, civil administration was greatly affected, with\noffice buildings destroyed and staff either killed, injured, or suffering the loss of family members\nand property. Many houses were either destroyed or damaged, rendering more than 1.7 million\npeople homeless.\n6. The calamity hit Gujarat at a time when the state was trying to recuperate from the severe\nflooding due to cyclones in 1998 and 1999, and droughts in 1999 and 2000. The most recent\ndrought is reported to have affected 84 percent of the state\u2019s population, with 146 of 174 major water\nreservoirs holding less than 25 percent of the designated storage level; the impact on agriculture and\nanimal  husbandry  was  significant.  The  cyclones  and  droughts  alone  required  additional  state", "3\nspending equivalent to 0.2 percent of gross state domestic product (GSDP) in FY1999, about 0.3\npercent in FY2000, and 0.5 percent projected for FY2001.\n7. The population affected by the earthquake has little in the way of coping strategies,\nparticularly the many who have lost all their possessions and currently face life without shelter.\nThe evident immediate needs are for food, shelter, clothing, medicine, and sanitation facilities.\nTrauma counseling is also an urgent requirement. Restoration of transport infrastructure, water\nsupply and sanitation, power, and housing will be a priority of the recovery strategy.\n1. Physical Damage\n8. The earthquake had a severe impact on the life and livelihood of people in the Kachchh\nregion of Gujarat. So far, about 290,000 houses and huts are reported as destroyed and\nanother  488,000  damaged  in  the  earthquake-affected  rural  areas,  and  a  further  141,000\nhousing units in affected urban areas. Moreover, several of the urban areas, including Anjar,\nBhachau, Bhuj, Gandhidham, and Rapar are completely or almost completely destroyed and will\nneed reconstruction.\n9. Damage  to  infrastructure  and  household  property  was  extensive.  The  agriculture,\nindustry, and services sectors were also significantly affected, both in terms of lost assets as\nwell as in loss of production and income. The total economic damage is estimated at about $3.4\nbillion, or approximately 13 percent of GSDP. Damage to physical infrastructure accounts for\nabout 65 percent of total economic damage (comprising direct and indirect, i.e., flow-related\ncosts).2 These estimates are based on initial rapid assessment combined with more detailed\nsurveys undertaken by GOG, as well as field assessment by the Joint Mission. Preliminary\nestimates suggest that the cost of the rehabilitation and reconstruction of physical infrastructure\nincluding housing will be about $2.3 billion over the next 2-3 years.\n2. Economic Impact\n10. The economic impact of the earthquake comprises (i) losses to immovable assets, (ii)\nlosses to movable assets, (iii) economic losses due to business interruption, and (iv) economic\ncosts to the public sector. Losses to immovable and movable assets reflect the direct economic\ncosts due to destroyed or damaged buildings and other physical infrastructure, as well as the\neconomic losses due to destroyed or damaged contents of public and private buildings, and\nequipment.  Public  sector  economic  costs  accrue  due  to  revenue  losses  and  increases  in\nbudgetary expenditures for immediate relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.\n11. The potential impact of the earthquake on Gujarat\u2019s GSDP comes in the wake of two\nconsecutive droughts, which had already adversely affected agricultural production and state\nincome. The loss in infrastructure facilities and productive capacity of almost Rs100 billion is\nlikely to reduce state income by about Rs20 billion during the first year. The income loss\n(amounting to 2-3 percent of GSDP) is expected to be partly offset by the investment for\nreconstruction that will boost income by restoring supply capacity and stimulating demand. As a\nresult, the loss of GSDP may be less than 0.5 percent of GSDP in FY2002. Given Gujarat\u2019s\nshare in India\u2019s gross domestic product of about 6 percent, the impact of the earthquake on\nIndia\u2019s national income will be relatively minor. The earthquake had no perceptible impact on\n                                                \n2 The total damage of about $3.4 billion comprises (i) damage to physical infrastructure: $2.3 billion; (ii) loss/damage\nto commercial buildings (excluding inventory): $260 million; and (iii) projected output loss due to damaged\ninfrastructure, and loss of fiscal revenues: $830 million. There are some differences between the assessment of\ndamages and rehabilitation costs made by the Joint World Bank-ADB Mission and GOG estimates; e.g. GOG\nestimated the value of lost household assets at par with the value of damaged housing; this would raise the figure\non total economic damage by a further $850 million-$900 million.", "4\nthe general price level or balance of payments. The adequate supply of essential commodities,\nincluding food-grain stocks, contributed to the maintenance of inflation stability. Notwithstanding,\nrelative prices for individual commodities, such as cement and steel, have risen sharply in\nanticipation of the heightened demand associated with reconstruction.\n12. The  impact  on  GOG\u2019s  public  finances  and  its  program  of  medium-term  fiscal\nconsolidation is likely to be more severe. The earthquake will have adverse effects on both the\ngovernment\u2019s revenues as well as its expenditures. The loss of income in the affected region,\ndecline in employment opportunities, and lower housing stock may lower revenues from sales\ntax, profession tax, and stamp duty and registration fees, by an amount equivalent to 0.2\npercent and 0.5 percent of GSDP in FY2001 and FY2002, respectively. Higher outlays for relief\nand reconstruction will add pressure on the state budget. The cost for immediate financial\nassistance through cash compensation, food supplies, medical relief, and debris removal, as\nwell as emergency restoration of water, power, and telecommunications amounted to Rs2.1\nbillion ($45 million) in the first three weeks following the earthquake and is projected by GOG to\ntotal Rs6.5 billion ($140 million), equivalent to 0.5 percent of GSDP by the end of March 2001,\nthe  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  Although  still  tentative,  GOG  is  anticipating  expenditure  on\nrehabilitation alone to exceed Rs100 billion ($2.3 billion equivalent).3 Together with the loss in\nrevenue, these additional expenditures are likely to raise the fiscal deficit by about 0.5-1.0\npercent of GSDP in FY2001, and by 1.5-2.5 percent of GSDP in FYs 2002 and 2003 depending\non the phasing of outlays and the inflow of additional receipts.4 The magnitude of the pressure\non  public  finances  will  pose  a  major  challenge  to  GOG  for  its  prudent  fiscal  and  debt\nmanagement.\n3.  Social Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n13. Despite a more than 50 percent decline in the incidence of poverty from 47 percent of\nthe population to 24 percent between 1972/73 to 1993/94,5 mainly on account of Gujarat\u2019s\nrelatively higher levels of industrialization and higher economic growth, the absolute number of\npoor declined much less, from 13.5 million to 10.4 million, during that period. Of these, about 6.2\nmillion live in rural areas, and 4.2 million in urban centers. Other indicators of poverty (e.g., child\nmalnutrition levels, infant mortality) show that the poor\u2014especially women and children\u2014may\nbe more disadvantaged than this figure suggests.\n14. The worst quake-hit districts of Jamnagar, Kachchh, Patan, and Surendranagar have\nhigh levels of rural and urban poverty. Agricultural productivity is low, reflecting the arid and\nsemiarid agroclimatic conditions, and capital intensity of industry and industrial value added is\nonly a fraction of the state-wide average, given the preponderance of small-scale industry and\ninformal sector activities. This is also reflected in the proportionately higher percentage of\nhouseholds occupying kachha and semipucca houses (Appendix 1, para. 2)(cid:190) a type of house\ngenerally  associated  with  the  poorer  sections  of  the  population(cid:190) particularly  in  Patan  and\nSurendranagar. Nonetheless, basic amenities such as electricity and safe drinking water are\nmore  generally  available  in  all  the  districts  (except  Surendranagar),  although  health  and\neducation facilities are distributed unevenly across the districts. The rural areas of Kachchh,\n                                                \n3 The figures for rehabilitation cost do not include damage to commercial buildings nor the cost of loss to inventory.\nGOG\u2019s financial burden for reconstruction and repair of private houses will depend on the extent of financial\nsupport it provides to the affected homeowners. In view of the relatively high incidence of poverty in the affected\nareas prior to the disaster, public funds will need to be provided to affected persons for private housing.\n4 Under normal arrangements for transfer of external assistance as additional central plan assistance, 30 percent of\nthe amount is provided as grant and 70 percent as loan.\n5 The latest available official data are from the 1993/94 (quienquennial) national sample survey. A new census is\ncurrently being undertaken in all states.", "5\nPatan, and Surendranagar have lower male and female literacy rates, higher infant mortality\nrate, and lower life expectancy than the state-wide average.\n15. The socioeconomic impact of the earthquake on the comparatively less-developed areas\nof Gujarat is severe. The social fabric of the quake-hit areas has been seriously affected by the\nlarge number of human deaths and injuries. In addition to the immediate suffering caused, a\nlarge number of families have been torn by the death or serious disability of a member. This will\nhave  long-term  consequences  on  the  well-being  of  other  members,  particularly  widows\n(especially young women), single-parent children, orphans, and the elderly. More adult women\ndied than men, and a large number of children were killed. Similar differences are likely among\nthe injured.\n16. Other social impacts of the quake include deep insecurity among those who have lost\nassets, including movable and immovable property, and increased vulnerability to poverty. The\nlivelihoods of many families have been disrupted, particularly among residents in the worst\naffected towns and villages. The loss of lives, the loss of or damage to home/workplace,\nproductive assets and/or industrial units has caused more severe disruption, while temporary\ndisruption has occurred in the wake of the shock and fear caused by the earthquake, and of\ndisruptions in financial services, markets, and distribution channels. Handicraft artisans and salt\nfarmers are the most severely affected groups.6 Another important source of livelihood in the\nregion is animal husbandry, about 18,000 cattle deaths have been reported. Economic recovery\nhas been hampered by the outflow of people, including normally migrant workers, such as\nlaborers on the salt farms in the affected areas.\nC. Natural Disaster Response7\n17. Although systems were in place to manage cyclones, drought, and floods, Gujarat was\nill-prepared for earthquakes. No authority had responsibility for earthquake preparedness, and\nno  contingency  plans  or  policies  had  been  adopted  for  dealing  with  such  a  catastrophe.\nNonetheless, GOG responded quickly. At the district level, the damage suffered impaired the\nresponse,  but  arrangements  were  rapidly  improvised.  GOG  immediately  began  emergency\nrescue operations, and initiated efforts to restore lost communication links, electricity, water\nsupply,  and  civil  supplies.  The  Government  also  launched  a  large-scale  relief  and  rescue\noperation, mobilizing available resources and personnel to assist the victims.8 The relief efforts\nat the central level were coordinated by the Natural Disaster Management Control Room, which\nhas worked closely with GOG\u2019s Control Room and the state relief commissioner. To coordinate\nthe longer-term reconstruction, on 6 February 2001 GOG established the Gujarat State Disaster\nManagement Authority (GSDMA) chaired by the chief minister, with nine members and its chief\nexecutive officer as member secretary. GSDMA has been registered as a society under the\nSocieties Act. GOG has also established the high-level Disaster Management Task Force to\nadvise on relief and reconstruction policies.\n18. Local government response was impaired due to the severity of the damage and the\nnear total loss of office infrastructure and communication, besides injuries to personnel and their\nfamily  members  as  also  the  disruption  to  their  normal  life.  Though  constrained  by  the\nearthquake-related  destruction,  the  district  administration  used  its  available  resources  and\n                                                \n6 Kachchh district alone accounts for 80 percent of India\u2019s salt production, and 80 percent of the facilities are\nreportedly dysfunctional.\n7  This section captures only the main emergency response measures taken after the disaster.\n8 The Government also provided Rs6.1 billion ($130 million equivalent) from the National Calamity Relief Fund and\nthe Prime Minister\u2019s Relief Fund as emergency cash assistance. In addition, the Reserve Bank of India permitted\nGOG to access ways and means advances beyond normal limits for emergency relief and rehabilitation until\n31 March 2001", "6\nrapidly launched the rescue and relief measures together with local military units.  Many local\nofficials lost family members and their homes, yet returned to work quickly to salvage what\noffice facilities could be recovered and coordinate relief activities.\n19. As is typical in disasters, community members immediately mobilized resources, helped\neach other, and provided whatever assistance they could. The strong NGO network in Gujarat\nsupported community efforts. Several well-known local and national NGOs such as the Self-\nEmployed  Women\u2019s  Association  are  active  in  the  area  and  are  helping  people  restore\nlivelihoods  and  meet  other  needs.    A  local  NGO,  the  Kachchh  Navnirman  Abhiyan,  was\nnominated as the coordinator of NGO activities, and has set up 22 local subcenters in the area\nto coordinate information and assistance, with encouragement and formal endorsement from\nGOG. Cooperation between international and national NGOs has also been extensive.\nD.  Aid Coordination and External Assistance\n20. In the wake of the disaster, the international community responded with immediate\nsupport. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs sent a five-member UN Disaster\nAssessment and Coordination team on 27 January, the day following the disaster. The UN\nDisaster  Management  Team,  assisted  by  staff  from  the  United  Nations  Development\nProgramme Emergency Response Division, were also deployed immediately to coordinate the\nUN response. The team established an on-site operation coordination center within the district\ncollector\u2019s compound in Bhuj. This has enabled the development of a close working relationship\nand a continuous exchange of information between the chief relief coordinator, the collector and\nthe  UN  system.  The  coordination  center  included  a  World  Health  Organization  disease\nsurveillance  desk  to  monitor  outbreaks  of  illness.  The  World  Food  Program  initiated  an\nemergency operation of more than $4 million to provide relief food rations to 300,000 people. All\nother UN organizations have sent assessment teams to the affected area. For the rehabilitation\nand recovery phase, the United Nations Development Programme will be the focal agency for\nthe UN system.\n21. Several countries sent search and rescue teams and equipment. In addition, numerous\ncountries have either pledged or provided cash and in-kind contributions on a bilateral basis,\nthrough NGOs or the UN system. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\nSocieties established a team in the town of Anjar and an emergency response unit hospital in\nBhuj. They also issued an appeal that resulted in more than $15 million being donated to\naddress the immediate needs of affected communities, including shelter, medical services and\nsupplies, and water and sanitation equipment.\n22. Several donors and multilateral institutions have pledged support to the longer-term\nrecovery efforts. In response to the request from the Government, ADB sent a team of experts\non disaster management and earthquake engineering to Gujarat on 2 February 2001 to assist\nGOG  with  preliminary  damage  assessment  and  the  institutional  setup  for  disaster\nmanagement.9  This  was  followed  on  12  February  by  the  fielding  of  the  Joint  Mission,  to\nundertake a damage assessment, by ADB and the World Bank in partnership with GOG and the\nGovernment, and to assist in developing a comprehensive recovery strategy. After the Joint\nMission, on 27 February an aid meeting was held in New Delhi to brief other multilateral and\nbilateral agencies on the assessment of damages and economic impacts of the earthquake, and\non the rehabilitation and reconstruction program.10\n                                                \n9 These experts were part of the consulting team contracted under TA 3379-IND: Strengthening Disaster Mitigation\nand Management at the State Level, for $1.0 million, approved on 28 December 1999.\n10Participants included representatives from the Department for International Development, European Commission,\nInternational Labor Organization, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Japan International Cooperation\nAgency, Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau, GTZ (German Development Cooperation), as well as the embassies of", "7\nE.  Lessons Learned\n23. A review of ADB-wide experience with rehabilitation assistance11 indicates the following\nessential factors: (i) projects must be prepared as quickly as possible; (ii) projects should focus\non restoring facilities; (iii) rehabilitation works, to the extent possible, should be completed within\ntwo years; (iv) implementation will place a heavy burden on executing agency (EA) staff and\ntherefore strong consulting support and ADB supervision is needed during implementation; and\n(v) efforts should be made to ensure that ADB\u2019s rapid response to disasters is matched by\nequally quick action by the government. Other lessons learned from ADB\u2019s earlier emergency\nprojects  include  (vi)  beneficiary  participation  must  be  ensured  and  increased  in  project\npreparation and implementation, especially in the maintenance of facilities; (vii) environment\nand social aspects should be considered during project implementation, even though the need\nfor a rapid response may not permit a detailed treatment of these issues prior to the approval of\nthe assistance; (viii) arrangements for disbursements(cid:190) including retroactive financing and the\nuse of imprest accounts(cid:190) should give the EAs quick and simple access to funds; (ix) project\nobjectives and scope need to be carefully defined; and (x) criteria for subproject selection\nshould permit simple prioritization of subprojects and short implementation periods.\n24. These lessons have been considered and incorporated in the design of the proposed\nProject. Indeed, ADB response has been very rapid: within a few days, a team of ADB-funded\ndisaster management experts started to provide assistance to GOG; within two weeks of the\ncalamity,  a  senior  delegation  from  ADB  visited  Gujarat,  and  the  Joint  World  Bank-ADB\nAssessment Mission was fielded to assist GOG in assessing the damage and in evolving a\nshort-  and  medium-term  recovery  and  rehabilitation  strategy;  and  Board  approval  for  the\nproposed  assistance  is  being  sought  within  less  than  two  months  from  receipt  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s request for assistance. The implementation period for the rehabilitation Project is\n33  months,  with  a  shorter  implementation  period  for  urgent  housing,  and  focuses  on  the\nimmediate rehabilitation of the physical and social infrastructure in the affected areas and the\nrestoration of livelihood for those affected. Simplified approval and implementation procedures\nhave been agreed upon with GOG. Strong consulting inputs, for project management, design\nand construction supervision, procurement, and financial management and audit are included.\nCriteria for subproject selection have been developed, and environmental safeguards built in.\nAdvance procurement action has been permitted and imprest accounts will be established to\nfacilitate  project  implementation.  Moreover,  the  proposed  Project  has  been  prepared  with\ncomplementarity of assistance from other multilateral and bilateral agencies and donors in mind.\nF.  ADB\u2019s Country Operational Strategy\n25. ADB\u2019s country operational strategy (COS) for India, prepared in 1996, is designed to\nsupport Government efforts in strengthening the economic and social development of the country.\nThe  overall  strategic  objective  of  the  COS  is  to  promote  economic  efficiency  and  higher\nsustainable growth to improve employment and reduce poverty. It has been operationalized with\nsupport for macroeconomic and structural reforms at the national and state levels; enhanced\nprivate sector participation; development of regulatory and institutional capacities; and enhanced\nresource mobilization through financial sector and capital market reforms. Consistent with India\u2019s\ndevelopment needs and ADB\u2019s strategic emphasis, increased focus is on poverty reduction. In the\ncontext of India\u2019s current inaccessibility to Asian Development Fund resources, the strategic\npriorities for ADB\u2019s contribution to reduce poverty include creating conditions for accelerated and\n                                                                                                                                                         \nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United\nStates of America, in addition to representatives from ADB and the World Bank.\n11Benson, C. and W.T. Lincklaen-Arriens. 1999. Rehabilitation Assistance after Disasters: A Review of Lessons\nLearned and Emerging Issues, 3rd draft, ADB, Manila.", "8\nsustainable growth, expanding social opportunities for the poor, and developing comprehensive\npartnerships for state-level operations. A new country strategy is currently being prepared.\n26. A key feature of the COS is a shift in ADB activities to support for comprehensive\neconomic and structural reforms in selected states. ADB\u2019s assistance focuses on supporting\nmacroeconomic reform and fiscal consolidation to improve public saving and enhance resource\nmobilization; increasing efficiency in resource use by rationalizing unproductive expenditure,\nand restructuring and divesting state-owned enterprises; strengthening local government and\nimproving  good  governance;  and  reforming  policies  in  key  physical  infrastructure  sectors,\nespecially  power,  the  major  cause  of  fiscal  hemorrhage  in  most  states.  The  state-level\noperations  also  focus  on  fostering  human  development  by  supporting  the  reallocation  of\nbudgetary resources to social sectors to thereby enable addressing vital cross-cutting concerns\non a sustainable basis. Gujarat was the first state chosen for ADB\u2019s state-level operations and a\nloan and TA program was approved in 1996.12 ADB assistance so far has focused on improving\npublic  resource  management,  reforming  the  power  sector,13  and  establishing  of  Gujarat\nInfrastructure Development Board as the first infrastructure project development facility of its\nkind in India.\n27. The proposed Project will rehabilitate damaged infrastructure and housing, and will\nprovide support for livelihood rehabilitation. It will enable people to rebuild to resume normal life\nby restoring availability of basic services such as drinking water and electricity, provide housing\nto mitigate homelessness, and foster economic opportunities. This is fundamental for resuming\nthe socioeconomic development process in Gujarat, one of ADB\u2019s focal states. The Project is,\ntherefore, in line with ADB\u2019s COS for India and in accordance with ADB\u2019s overarching objective\nof poverty reduction.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n28. The intensity of the earthquake resulted in a major catastrophy, severely impacting the\nlocal population. The quake, the worst on record for the past half century, caused more than\n19,000 confirmed deaths, and left 200,000 injured and up to 1.7 million homeless. In addition,\nthe quake completely destroyed 300,000 and damaged more than 600,000 dwelling units and\nmuch of the power, water supply, and sanitation systems.\n29. Because the quake\u2019s epicenter was in the Kachchh district of Gujarat, the impact on\npeople\u2019s lives and economic activity was even greater, as this was the fifth major disaster to\nstrike the northeastern part of Gujarat in the past four years. The four preceding events include\ntwo cyclones and two severe droughts, the second of which is still causing major distress to the\npoorest regions in the state. Therefore, GOG\u2019s and civil society\u2019s economic resilience were\nalready depleted and the estimated $2.3 billion cost of rehabilitation and reconstruction of basic\nservices, together with the further $1 billion-$1.5 billion of economic damage due to loss of\nproduction  and  lower  fiscal  revenues,  would  be  impossible  for  the  state  to  bear  without\nassistance. By providing financing for the most urgently needed components and works, the\nloan  will  enable  GOG  to  finance  a  portion  of  the  overall  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction\nprogram, as well as help restore the economic activity essential for survival of residents in the\nheavily affected areas.\n                                                \n12Since then, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala have been selected as additional focal states for ADB\u2019s state-level\nassistance.\n13Loan  1803  and  1804-IND:  Gujarat Power Sector Development Program,  for  $350  million,  approved  on\n13 December 2000 was the first sector development program loan to India.", "9\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n30. The  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  support  GOG\u2019s  efforts  to  rehabilitate  and\nreconstruct essential infrastructure damaged in the affected areas of the state, especially the\nJamnagar, Kachchh, Patan, Rajkot, and Surendranagar districts. This is essential to enable\nearly restoration of economic and social activity in the affected areas, especially for the poor.\nThe Project will focus on the highest priority areas, identified through consultations with GOG,\npublic and private sector, NGOs, and other civil society. Based on the Joint Mission assessment\n(para. 2), incorporating complementarity with assistance from other agencies and donors, the\nsectors identified for the Project include housing, urban and rural infrastructure, power, and\nlivelihood rehabilitation. In addition, the Project will provide assistance for institutional support,\nas well as multihazard disaster preparedness and mitigation.\n31. The Project will have the following parts.\n32. Part A: Housing. Houses with structural damage will be rehabilitated and strengthened,\nand new houses constructed if the houses were completely destroyed. Work will focus on the\npoorer  sections  of  the  population,  particularly  those  living  below  poverty  line  and  the\neconomically weaker sections of the population in the affected rural areas (Appendix 1).14\n33. Part B: Urban and Rural Infrastructure. Work will focus on urban and rural water\nsupply, sewerage, sanitation, drainage, roads, streets and related structures, markets, bus and\ntruck  stations,  civic  buildings  and  staff  quarters,  electrification  and  lighting,  administrative\nhardware, utility vehicles including water tankers, fire trucks, garbage collection and compactor\nequipment, development of sites and services, and commercial and industrial use and related\ndebris removal and appurtenances (Appendixes 2 and 3).\n34. Part  C:  Power.  This  part  will  focus  on  refurbishing  and  rehabilitating  substations,\ntransmission lines, distribution systems, staff quarters, administrative and related buildings,\nswitch gear and transformers, control systems and related equipment and works (Appendix 4).\n35. Part D: Livelihood Rehabilitation. Support will be provided for livelihood projects given\nthe strong interlinkages between economic rehabilitation of the society, housing reconstruction,\nand access to basic needs. The specific projects will include financial and infrastructure support\nfor skill-based affected persons, including retraining of affected persons needing alternative line\nof work and livelihood (Appendix 5).\n36. Part E: Consulting Services and Incremental Administrative Support. Support will\nbe provided for concerned state agencies and municipal bodies to implement the rehabilitation\nand reconstruction, capacity building, benefit monitoring, as well as incremental equipment,\nservices, supplies, and incremental personnel costs incurred by the agencies responsible for\nproject implementation.\n37. Part F: Multihazard Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation. Support will be provided\nfor  GOG,  to  include  preparation  of  disaster  management  plans,  disaster  management\ninformation systems, and disaster management training (Appendix 6). \n                                                \n14The poorer section would include housing units proposed to be rehabilitated up to a unit size of 50 square meters,\nas defined only in each of the, rehabilitation packages No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 of GOG\u2019s Resolution No. PNV-\n162001-1502 (1)-S.3, dated 23 February 2001.", "10\n38. The Project was developed in close cooperation with the World Bank and bilateral\nassistance agencies, who will also finance part of the reconstruction program.15 The Project will\nfollow  a  sector  approach  to  facilitate  selection  of  the  highest  priority  subprojects  during\nimplementation. The sector approach is a suitable modality for emergencies, as it allows quick\nresponse and maximum flexibility of both geographic coverage and components, within the\nagreed framework and selection criteria. It will also enable GOG to utilize the Project based on\nfinancial  considerations  related  to  access  to  alternate  funding.  The  eligible  urban  centers\ncomprise all cities and towns in the earthquake-affected areas, while in the rural areas all\nearthquake-affected districts and villages are covered.\n39. The Project is an essential component of GOG\u2019s overall plans for recovery from the\ndisaster and will focus on rehabilitating and reconstructing or replacing facilities, with due regard\nto technological improvement, changed circumstances, and disaster prevention by incorporating\nstructural  strengthening  and  improvements  against  future  earthquake  and  other  natural\ndisasters. Special focus will be placed on the needs of the poorer sections of the population in\nterms of housing and access to basic services.\nC. Cost Estimates\n40. Cost estimates for the Project are based on the damage assessment of the Joint World\nBank-ADB Mission and interactions with Government, GOG, and local authorities. GOG\u2019s initial\nestimates were reviewed and updated based on detailed assessments carried out by a joint\nteam of about 35 persons from the two banks, supported by ADB TA consultants for disaster\nmanagement and earthquake engineering (footnote 9), and various GOG and local officials.\nThrough the one-week field mission to the damaged areas, the joint World Bank/ADB team\ntrained GOG assessors through hands-on detailed inspection and analysis of on-site damage in\nthree of the most severely damaged towns. Based on this training, GOG was able to update the\ndamage assessments throughout the affected areas of Gujarat. The end result was coalesced\ninto  a  joint  assessment  report.  The  damage  estimates  are  based  on  rehabilitating  and\nreconstructing the housing stock and various public infrastructure. These estimates were then\nrefined to incorporate earthquake-resistant designs, materials, and improved technology. The\ndamage  assessments  will  continue  to  be  updated  as  more  detailed  information  becomes\navailable as clean up continues. These will be updated during the detailed design phase of the\nvarious project components.16\n41. The cost of the Project is estimated at $625 million equivalent (Table 2). Since a sector\napproach is being followed, the cost estimates are on a sectoral basis. A summary of the cost\nestimates is available in Appendix 7.\n                                                \n15In particular, the World Bank will provide assistance for the health, education, irrigation, and roads sectors in\naddition to public buildings and housing, and will finance the provision of temporary shelters and ongoing debris\nremoval. Total World Bank lending from both nonconcessional and concessional sources will be $1.0 billion. TA as\nwell as support for the education sector is being considered by the United States Agency for International\nDevelopment and the Netherlands.\n16ADB and the World Bank jointly conducted detailed assessments for several of the most damaged towns. For the\nurban infrastructure component under part B, the town of Anjar was used as the basis for assessing damage and\nthe  required  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  for  urban  infrastructure.  The  basis  for  the  rural  infrastructure\ncomponent was the damage assessment and reconstruction requirements developed in close conjunction with the\nGujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board. The estimates for power systems damage were based on the detailed\nassessment by Gujarat Electricity Board. These benchmarks were used to develop the eligibility criteria, the related\nscope and cost of the Project, and the implementation arrangements that are described in Chapter IV.F.", "11\nTable 2: Cost Estimate\n($ million)\nForeign Local\nItem Cost Currency Currency\nPart A: Housing 250 30 220\nPart B: Urban and Rural Infrastructure 217 45 173\nPart C: Power 98 24 74\nPart D: Livelihood Rehabilitation 20 2 18\nPart E: Consulting  Services  and  Incremental 15 1 14\nAdministrative Support\nPart F: Multihazard  Disaster  Preparedness  and 20 5 15\nMitigation\nFront-End Fee 5 5 0\nTotal 625 112 513\nSource: Staff estimates.\nD. Financing Plan\n42. The proposed ADB loan is for $500 million equivalent, representing 80 percent of the\ntotal cost of the Project (Table 3).17 The loan will finance 80 percent of housing, and urban and\nrural  infrastructure,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies;  the  full  cost  of  livelihood\nrehabilitation, consulting services and incremental administrative support; and about 68 percent\nof the power component. The Borrower will pay to ADB a front-end fee in an amount equal to\none percent of the loan amount. The fee will be capitalized in the loan. GOG will meet the $125\nmillion  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost  components  of  the  Project.  Although  ADB\u2019s\nproposed share of financing is relatively high, it is justified in view of the special circumstances\nof this Project, and is in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Rehabilitation Assistance after\nDisasters18 and ADB\u2019s Graduation Policy for developing member countries. 19\n43. The Borrower will be India. The loan will be in accordance with the prevailing ADB policy\non Rehabilitation Assistance after Disasters (footnote 18). The loan will be from ADB\u2019s ordinary\ncapital resources with a term of 30 years including a 7-year grace period. It will carry an interest\nrate determined in accordance with the ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US\ndollar loans. The Borrower will treat the loan proceeds as an addition to the normal transfers\nallocated annually from the Government to GOG, i.e., as additional central plan assistance, and\ntransfer such proceeds to GOG at the prevailing loan-to-grant ratio. The local currency cost\nfinancing of the housing, urban and rural infrastructure, and power components is justified given\nthe tight fiscal situation in Gujarat already in place because of the successive years of cyclone\nand drought disasters and the extraordinary damage caused by the severe earthquake.\n                                                \n17As noted in para. 2, as well as in the information paper to the Board (IN. 41-01: India: Impact of the Earthquake in\nGujarat and ADB\u2019s Proposed Assistance, 19 February 2001), consideration was initially given to reallocating\nproceeds from three approved loans. A more detailed assessment by the Mission indicated that reallocation of\nexisting loan proceeds may not be the most effective approach. The financing requirements of the different sectors\nrequired processing of a new sector-based loan for $500 million, in accordance with the Government\u2019s request.\n18 R191-88: Rehabilitation Assistance after Disasters, 2 February 1989, para. 47.\n19R204-98: A Graduation Policy for the Bank\u2019s DMCs, 23 November 1998, para. 87.", "12\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nItem ADB GOG Total\nPart A: Housing 200 50 250\nPart B: Urban and Rural Infrastructure 173 44 217\nPart C: Power 67 31 98\nPart D: Livelihood Rehabilitation 20 0 20\nPart E: Consulting Services and Incremental Administrative Support 15 0 15\nPart F: Multihazard Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation 20 0 20\nFront-End Fee 5 0 5\nTotal 500 125 625\nADB = Asian Development Bank, GOG = Government of Gujarat.\nSource: Staff estimates.\nE.  Executing Agency\n44. GOG  established  GSDMA,  with  a  mandate  to  manage  and  execute  the  entire\nrehabilitation and reconstruction works. GSDMA and GOG jointly will function as the EA for the\nProject.  GSDMA  will  also  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  assistance  provided  by  the\nmultilateral and bilateral development institutions, other aid and donor agencies, the private\nsector, and NGOs.20 The GSDMA is chaired by the chief minister, with nine members including\nthe  Minister  of  Finance,  the  chief  secretary,  the  additional  chief  secretary  (general\nadministration),  the  principal  secretaries  of  finance,  urban  development,  and  roads  and\nbuildings  departments,  the  relief  commissioner,  and  its  chief  executive  officer  as  member\nsecretary.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n45. The implementation arrangements for the Project have been designed to follow the\nestablished  procedures  and  practices  under  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  as  much  as\npossible to enable speedy and efficient implementation. ADB already has several ongoing\nprojects in each of the main sectors where financing will be provided: housing, urban and rural\ninfrastructure, and power, as well as disaster preparedness and mitigation (footnote 9). As such,\nthe  experience  gained  and  lessons  learned  from  these  have  been  incorporated  into  the\nformulation of the works and design implementation.\n46. To ensure timely Project implementation, the responsibility for project administration will\nbe delegated to ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission (INRM) in Delhi. ADB will establish an extended\nmission  in  Gandhinagar,21  under  INRM\u2019s  management  for  the  duration  of  project\nimplementation. The extended mission will be headed by an INRM staff member. Moreover,\nconsultants, who are familiar with ADB procedures and policies, particularly for procurement,\naccounts and audit, and benefit monitoring, will be recruited. The extended mission will assist\nINRM in administering the Project by closely monitoring compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements\nunder the Project to ensure quality control, speedy implementation of subproject approvals and\nrehabilitation and reconstruction activities, and rapid assistance to implementing agencies (IAs)\non any procurement problems or other project implementation matters. The extended mission\nwill also support INRM in carrying out random and spot checks on procurement and accounts of\nthe Project or the subprojects, and inspect project facilities reconstructed or rehabilitated under\n                                                \n20 To this effect, the Gujarat Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Fund was established in mid-February 2001 and will\nbe managed by GSDMA.\n21Gandhinagar is the administrative capital of Gujarat, and is located about 20 km from Ahmedabad.", "13\nthe Project for quality control. The provisions of the \u201cAgreement between the Government of\nIndia and the Asian Development Bank regarding the Resident Office of the Asian Development\nBank\u201d dated 18 November 1992 will apply to the extended mission, its premises, ADB staff\nmembers and consultants assigned to or associated with the extended mission.\n1. Overall Coordination and Guidance\n47. GSDMA will (i) guide and monitor overall project implementation to ensure that the\npolicies, guidelines, and requirements of GOG and ADB are met; (ii) oversee preparation of\ndetailed  damage  assessments,  surveys,  plans,  designs,  and  monitoring  of  the  various\ncomponents, procurement, and works under the Project; (iii) provide executive decisions to\nensure that rapid and efficient delivery of the reconstruction works is achieved; (iv) ensure close\ncoordination  between  the  activities  financed  by  the  Project  and  those  sponsored  by  other\nagencies to prevent overlap and duplication; (v) ensure that counterpart funds are provided in\nthe full amount in a timely manner; (vi) ensure that the specifications, plans, and quality control\nof the works are met; (vii) control and monitor the flow of funds to the IAs; (viii) ensure that\nproper accounts are maintained for the Project and the subprojects; (ix) ensure that each\nrelevant IAs recruits enough staff and consultants to properly implement the Project and that\nsufficient related funds are allocated; and (x) ensure that ADB is informed in a timely manner of\nthe progress and any issues arising during implementation. GOG has assured ADB that it will\nrecruit and staff GSDMA with suitably qualified and experienced personnel.\n48. GOG and GSDMA will also ensure that the various IAs including GOG\u2019s line ministries\nand agencies, and city, town, and district authorities consult with local elected bodies, civic\nsociety, and the general public about issues related to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of\nhousing  and  urban/rural  infrastructure.  GSDMA  will  facilitate  and  empower  NGOs  and\ncommunity organizations to help the beneficiaries access information about the various project\ncomponents,  have  input  in  the  decision-making  process,  participate  in  construction  where\ncapability exists, and enable participatory monitoring. As a high-level agency, GSDMA will\nresolve any problems that may arise, including land acquisition, cooperation from other line\nministries  and  agencies,  and  local  elected  bodies.  GSDMA  is  establishing  a  project\nmanagement and coordination unit (PMCU) to provide day-to-day assistance and guidance to\nthe project IAs. GSDMA is also establishing a disaster management division to be responsible\nfor disaster mitigation and management on a state-wide basis and development of the required\nadministrative and institutional arrangements. Appendix 8 provides the organization chart.\n2. Project Management and Coordination Unit\n49. GSDMA will set up the PMCU to act on its behalf as the EA on routine matters and will\nhave decision-making authority to facilitate project implementation. The PMCU in conjunction\nwith the IAs and the participating districts, cities, and towns will prioritize and select subprojects\nunder the Project. The PMCU will be supported by project management consultants who will\nprovide specialized technical support and advice on earthquake and other natural calamities\u2019\nengineering, financial management and accounting, beneficiary participation, benefit monitoring\nand evaluation, and capacity building. The PMCU will conduct regular project implementation\nmeetings with each IA. The ADB extended mission will provide advice and guidance related to\nADB\u2019s procedures and requirements.\n3. Implementing Agencies\n50. An IA will be responsible for each of the key sectors included under the Project reporting\nto  the  PMCU.  The  prioritization,  technical  preparation,  and  implementation  of  the  eligible\nsubprojects under parts A through D will be carried out by the respective IAs described in paras.", "14\n52-57. The IAs will be responsible for day-to-day implementation of the reconstruction works.\nThey  will  conduct  the  detailed  assessments,  surveys,  and  planning  of  the  reconstruction,\nincluding public consultations and input from the recipient local entities. They will then prioritize\nthe  works,  prepare  the  detailed  designs  and  specifications,  schedules  of  quantities,  cost\nestimates, bidding documents, contracts, and related documentation. They will also recruit\ndesign and supervision consultants, conduct procurement, support local entities that wish to do\ntheir own reconstruction work, supervise construction, conduct quality control, approve progress\npayments to contractors, maintain records and accounts, prepare regular reports for GSDMA\nand ADB, and ensure that benefit monitoring and auditing is carried out. The IAs will also keep\nseparate up-to-date accounts for the Project and make these available to ADB, its missions, or\nits auditors for inspection. The IAs will be supported by design and construction supervision\nconsultants under the Project.\n51. To ensure timely project implementation, GOG has agreed to specific measures to\nensure  that  the  internal  approval  process  for  subproject  selection  and  approval,  contract\ntendering and signing, approval of progress claims, and provision of counterpart funds do not\nunduly slow reconstruction implementation. In this context, GOG has agreed that for each IA,\napplicable approval whether by GSDMA or within the concerned line ministry, will be given\npreferably within five working days, including request for additional clarification of additional\ninformation. The PMCU will be responsible for supporting GSDMA and line ministries with\nfacilitation of and adherence to this arrangement.\n52. The IA responsible for part A, housing, will be the Panchayats, Rural Housing, and Rural\nDevelopment Department.\n53. The IA responsible for the urban infrastructure component of part B will be the Gujarat\nUrban Development Company. The company will work closely with the recipient urban entities\nto  complete  the  detailed  damage  assessments,  prioritize  works,  planning,  and  beneficiary\nparticipation. The works eligible under this component include all urban infrastructure: water\nsupply, sewerage and drainage, sanitation, roads, civic buildings, electrification, and related\nfacilities.\n54. The Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB) will be the IA for the rural\ninfrastructure  component  of  part  B,  including  the  reconstruction  of  all  water  supply  and\nsanitation works in the rural areas and villages, as well as for the bulk water supply to the\nparticipating urban bodies. GWSSB is the agency responsible for bringing bulk water supply to\nall  villages  and  district  cities  and  towns,  and  is  currently  operating  and  maintaining  these\nsystems.  The  villages  and  towns  are  responsible  for  distribution  inside  village  and  urban\nboundaries. On a case by case basis, these entities may opt to have GWSSB operate these\nfacilities  on  their  behalf.  Other  villages  and  towns  have  privatized  the  operation  and\nmaintenance, and GSWWB will coordinate closely with these operators. GWSSB is experienced\nwith planning, design, and construction management, and will interact with and support the\nGujarat Urban Development Company in the urban reconstruction.\n55. For part C, power systems reconstruction, the IA will be the Gujarat Electricity Board\n(GEB).  GEB  has  extensive  experience  with  planning,  design,  and  construction  of  power\ndistribution facilities. It is the recipient of the previously approved power sector loan (footnote\n13). The implementation of the reconstruction component will be similar to those already in\nplace for the ongoing power sector project.\n56. For part D, the IAs will be the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, and the\nIndustries and Mines Department, and such other state departments as may be agreed between\nthe ADB and the GOG.", "15\n57. Part E will entail management and technical support to the PMCU and the IAs for\nsmooth  and  efficient  implementation,  including  the  design,  procurement,  quality  control,\naccounting, monitoring, and reporting requirements for the Project. The component will also\nprovide support for capacity building of the responsible agencies focusing on operation and\nmaintenance after reconstruction. In addition, the component will support GOG with the cost of\nthe incremental administrative outlays for project implementation. Part F will provide support for\nestablishing an effective multihazard disaster preparedness and mitigation program.\n4. Selection and Approval of Subprojects\n58. Subprojects will be identified, evaluated, and selected by the IAs, and endorsed by the\nPMCU, on the basis of the following criteria:\n(i) will  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  the  quake-damaged  infrastructure  including\nhousing;\n(ii) will include works to restore the damaged facilities, incorporating strengthening to\nmultihazard standards, with adequate provision for technological improvement,\nand quality control;\n(iii) will follow cost effective and least-cost alternatives;\n(iv) will not involve overlap with funding from other agencies, although other agencies\nsuch as bilaterals and NGOs could be involved in cofinancing, as well as in the\ndelivery of specified additional support such as monitoring, capacity building, and\npoverty reduction, in which case they will be clearly identified;\n(v) except as otherwise agreed by ADB, is scheduled to be completed not later than\n31 December 2003, provided that in the case of part A an earlier completion date\nmay be scheduled;\n(vi)  will incorporate beneficiary consultation and input in the selection process; and\n(vii) will comply with applicable ADB requirements, i.e., the involuntary resettlement\npolicy,22  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  of  the  ADB,  and  the\nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure, Industrial,  and  Power\nDevelopment Projects.23\n59. The first subproject to be carried out by each IA will be subject to prior review and\napproval by ADB. Subsequent subprojects exceeding $500,000 equivalent will be sent to the\nPMCU and ADB for information only, while all subprojects exceeding $3 million equivalent will\nrequire prior review and approval by ADB. Any subproject involving significant resettlement will\nrequire preparation of a resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for involuntary\nresettlement (footnote 22) and be agreed with ADB before carrying out the subproject.\n5. Consulting Services\n60. Given the tight time schedule and the shortage of well-trained and experienced staff in\nGOG and GSDMA, substantial support is required for the PMCU and the IAs. Consulting\n                                                \n22ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement. Appendix 1. Manila.\n23No components or works require environmental impact assessment.", "16\nservices are required due to the need for (i) careful and detailed assessment and analysis of the\nearthquake  damage  in  each  sector;  (ii)  prioritization  of  the  subprojects;  (iii)  preparation  of\nsubprojects in accordance with GOG and ADB requirements; (iv) incorporation of earthquake\nresistance; (v) rapid planning, design, and implementation of the works; (vi) support for the\nPMCU and IAs because the massive scale of the reconstruction will result in new demands and\nadditional  workload;  (vii)  intensive  supervision  of  works  to  ensure  quality  control  and\ntransparency is maintained by contractors and local bodies carrying out smaller works; and (viii)\nprovision of detailed accounting, auditing, and reporting to the PMCU and ADB.\n61. The project management consultants required to support the PMCU will help with (i)\noverall project coordination and management; (ii) maintenance of accounts and operation of the\nimprest account for the Project in accordance with ADB guidelines; (iii) provision of guidance to\nIAs in identifying, selecting, and preparing subprojects on a priority basis; (iv) evaluation of the\ninitial and large subprojects and liaison with ADB to ensure early approvals; and (v) meeting the\nreporting requirements. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in section A of\nAppendix 9. About 60 person-months of international and 132 person-months of domestic\nexpertise will be required.\n62. The  PMCU  will  also  require  independent  consultants  for  benefit  monitoring  and\nevaluation of the subprojects. The benefit monitoring and evaluation consultant would be a\nlarger NGO operating in the affected areas with linkage to other NGOs active in the subproject\nareas, supported by specified outside experts. The outline terms of reference are also in section\nA of Appendix 9. About 320 person-months of domestic expertise is required.\n63. The design and construction supervision consultants will support the individual IAs with\nthe  day-to-day  reconstruction  requirements,  including  (i)  identification,  prioritization,  and\nformulation of subprojects; (ii) detailed surveys and damage assessment of earthquake-related\ndamage; (iii) preparation of plans, designs, specifications, including earthquake resistance and\ncost  estimates;  (iv)  preparation  of  prequalification,  tender,  and  contract  documents;  (v)\nevaluation  of  bids  and  contract  awards;  (vi)  supervision  of  construction,  quality,  cost  and\nschedule control, measurement, and approvals of contractors\u2019 work and progress claims; (vii)\nissuance of completion certificates; and (viii) preparation of subproject accounts, audits, and\nreports. The outline terms of reference for each of parts A, B, and C of the Project are in\nsections B-D of Appendix 9. About 1,300 person-months of domestic expertise will be required,\nsupported by up to 5,000 person-months of domestic technical inspectors.24\n64. Extensive capacity building and training will be required for city, town, village, and other\nadministrations that will be responsible for operating and maintaining the reconstructed works.\nThis will be accommodated under the consulting services, and includes support to the Disaster\nManagement Unit under GSDMA as outlined in Appendix 6, and for monitoring and analyzing\nthe groundwater and aquifer conditions in the Kachchh region to determine the impacts of the\nearthquake. This is essential as groundwater provides 90 percent of the drinking water for more\nthan a million people living in the district.\n65. All consultants will be engaged by the PMCU and the IAs in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nengagement of domestic consultants. \n66. Since the rehabilitation and reconstruction work to be financed under the Project must\nbe completed within 33 months due to the nature of the Project, expeditious selection and\n                                                \n24GOG is fielding 3,000 technical engineers and inspectors to assess the earthquake damage. They provide on-site\ninspection and monitoring of the works in 15 cities, towns, and 1,100 villages damaged in the earthquake.", "17\nfielding of consultants is necessary. Accordingly, GSDMA and the IAs may recruit directly from\nconsultants already engaged for ADB-financed projects in India and providing services similar to\nthose required for the Project for design and construction supervision. This arrangement will\nprovide an efficient way to recruit consultants under the circumstances. At the request of GOG,\nADB will assist in the selection process, shortlisting, solicitation, and evaluation of proposals, as\nwell as contract negotiations.\n6. Procurement\n67. Procurement of goods and services to be financed by the Project will be carried out in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  Since  the  value  of  contracts  will  be\nrelatively small and scattered over a wide range of the affected areas of Gujarat, they are not\nlikely to attract international suppliers. Equipment and materials will need to be delivered as\nquickly as possible due to the Project\u2018s urgent nature. The tight delivery schedules will be\nunattractive  to  international  suppliers  through  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.\nThese will therefore be procured through international shopping for goods not readily available\nin India, and local competitive bidding procedures for goods manufactured in India. This will not\npreclude international suppliers from bidding through their local outlets.\n68. The civil works contracts will generally be of low value, below $1 million equivalent,\nexcept for a few that may be in the $3 million-$5 million range. These contracts will be for works\nin  several  towns,  districts,  and  villages  spread  across  the  affected  areas  of  Gujarat.  This\ncombined with the local conditions caused by the disaster, requiring construction camps with\nlimited facilities, will make interest from international contractors unlikely. All civil works will be\ncarried  out  through  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  No  separate\nprequalification requirements are needed, and the classification and registration procedures for\ncontractors already well established in GOG will be followed in most cases. However, because\nof the enormity of the reconstruction requirements, national contractors who are not already\nregistered with GOG\u2019s system will be encouraged to register and participate in the bidding\nprocess by submitting their qualification information along with their bids. Two- envelope bidding\nprocedures will be employed as appropriate. The qualification criteria used for similar works\nunder ADB-financed projects elsewhere in India will be used as references in the preparation of\nbidding documents. ADB will also provide the responsible IAs with a list of national contractors\nwho have qualified and successfully completed similar works on other ADB-financed projects.\n69. All contracts for equipment and materials valued at $100,000 equivalent or less will be\nprocured using direct purchase procedures acceptable to ADB. Prior ADB concurrence will be\nrequired for all contracts in excess of $3 million equivalent before award of contracts. The IAs\nwill be able to award contracts valued below $3 million directly, after their consultants have\nevaluated the bids per ADB procedures and requirements. The contracts for equipment and\nmaterials with a value less than $3 million can be procured by international shopping or local\ncompetitive bidding. ADB will need to approve the first contract awarded by each IA, regardless\nof value to ensure ADB procedures are met. However, for the power sector, procurement of\nequipment packages valued at more than $100,000 equivalent but less than or equivalent to $5\nmillion will follow international shopping procedures, and equipment packages with a value\nexceeding the equivalent of $5 million will follow international competitive bidding procedures. In\nthe  case  of  housing  by  individuals  (up  to  Rs90,000),  procurement  of  materials  and\nreconstruction  works  will  be  in  accordance  with  established  commercial  practices  and\nsatisfactory implementation arrangements acceptable to ADB.", "18\n7. Advance Action\n70. Given the urgency of the Project, ADB has approved advance action for the procurement\nof equipment, materials, and civil works, and the recruitment of consultants, provided such\nadvance action incorporates compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements and that this takes place on\nor after 12 February 2001, the starting date for project appraisal. The Government and GOG\nhave been advised that approval of such advance action does not commit ADB to finance any\npart of the Project.\n8. Retroactive Financing\n71. Retroactive financing is required for the financing of immediate rehabilitation of essential\nfacilities  such  as  water,  sanitation,  power,  housing,  and  consulting  services.  The  Project\ntherefore proposes provision of retroactive financing for eligible expenditures incurred not earlier\nthan 12 February 2001 (date of appraisal), provided that the expenditures are in accordance\nwith agreed procedures and are certified by the IAs and consultants, and the certification is\nacceptable to ADB.  Retroactive financing will not exceed $50 million equivalent (10 percent of\nthe loan). The Government and GOG have been advised that the proposal for provision for\nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.\n9. Implementation Schedule\n72. ADB and GOG have agreed that the implementation will be completed in two phases.\nThe first phase is the restoration of critical and essential facilities such as housing, power,\nwater, and basic sanitation, necessary to provide the more than one million affected people with\nminimum services during the reconstruction period until housing and services are fully restored.\nThe second phase will involve implementation of the remaining facilities and is scheduled for\ncompletion  not  later  than  31  December  2003.  In  view  of  the  importance  of  shelter,\nimplementation of part A, housing, is scheduled to be completed within a shorter time frame.\nThe implementation schedule is provided in Appendix 10.\n10. Imprest Accounts\n73. Imprest  accounts  in  India  are  normally  operated  by  the  Government  through  the\nComptroller of Aid Accounts and Audit (CAAA). The proceeds of the imprest advance are\nnormally retained by CAAA and released to the EA as reimbursement of expenditures already\nincurred under a project. However, in view of the need for immediate funding of rehabilitation\nand reconstruction under this Project, and the severe pressures on GOG\u2019s budget, the existing\nprocedure need to be modified for this exceptional case. GSDMA will establish a second-\ngeneration imprest account and the advances made to the imprest account maintained by\nCAAA will be immediately and fully transferred through GOG to the second-generation imprest\naccount. The imprest accounts will be operated by CAAA and GSDMA in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The statement of expenditures procedures may be used\nfor reimbursement of eligible expenditures to liquidate advances into the imprest account in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Any  individual  payment  to  be\nreimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement  of  expenditures  will  not  exceed  $100,000\nequivalent. The imprest accounts will be replenished on an as-required basis, within the total\nloan amounts for each of parts B, C, D, and F subject to confirmation by ADB that sufficient\nprogress has been achieved in terms of actual implementation compared with the expenditures\nincurred. Similarly, replenishment for part A, housing, related to housing support for the poorer\nsections of the population, will be made after inspection and confirmation of the delivery of funds\nfor the specified use and satisfactory progress on house construction and incorporation of\nearthquake strengthening measures.", "19\n74. The  Government  and  GOG  requested  initial  disbursement  under  the  loan  for  $100\nmillion in view of the expenses already incurred and estimated to be incurred in the coming six\nmonths.\n11. Reports, Reviews, Accounts, and Audits\n75. Overall project monitoring will be conducted by GSDMA, through the PMCU. The PMCU\nwill establish a reporting system for performance monitoring, issues resolution, and quarterly\naction plans. These will serve as management feedback to update and improve procedures,\nand provide the basis for quarterly reports to ADB. The action plans will incorporate quantitative\nand time-bound implementation targets and budget requirements. The action plans will be\napproved by the IAs, PMCU, and GSDMA. ADB will be invited to attend the quarterly and other\nkey meetings required to facilitate project implementation. Regular field review will also be\ncarried out by staff from the ADB\u2019s extended mission (para. 46) in conjunction with the PMCU to\nmonitor the physical progress of the subprojects and compliance with other ADB requirements\nsuch  as  procurement,  quality  control,  proper  accounts,  beneficiary  participation,  and  NGO\nconsultations.\n76. The Government and GOG will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project\nand its subprojects in accordance with sound accounting principles. GOG will ensure and\nmonitor that proper audit and accounting procedures are in place by the PMCU, GSDMA, and\nIAs to ensure efficient and economical use of the loan proceeds for the beneficiaries. Separate\naccounts and financial statements in relation to the Project and subprojects adequate to identify\nthe goods and services financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources, expenditures\nincurred, and the use of local funds will be maintained.  Such accounts and financial statements\nwill be maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles and certified by independent\nprivate auditors acceptable to ADB. GSDMA will provide to ADB (i) reports on such accounts\nand financial statements on a quarterly basis within 45 days of the close of each quarter, and (ii)\naccounts and financial statements as audited and certified, on a semiannual basis within 60\ndays of the close of each semiannual period. The Government and GOG will facilitate ADB\nrepresentatives to carry out spot or random checks on flow of funds through the imprest account\nmaintained by the Government, and the second-generation imprest account maintained by\nGSDMA. Within three months of the physical completion of each part of the Project, GOG will\nsubmit to ADB a detailed completion report on the implementation, costs, benefits, and other\ninformation required by ADB.  Annual certified audited accounts and financial statements will be\nprovided by GSDMA through GOG within nine months of the close of each financial year.\n12. Operation and Maintenance\n77. All public facilities reconstructed under the Project will be operated and maintained by\nrelevant agencies during and after completion of the works. For the infrastructure component\nunder part B, this refers to the participating towns, cities, and villages supported by GWSSB. If\nrequested, bulk water supply will be operated by GWSSB and the town and village facilities by\nthe  local  committees.    GUDCO  will  support  the  larger  towns  in  exploring  privatization  of\noperation  and  maintenance  of  revenue  generating  services.  For  part  C,  power  systems\nrehabilitation, the reconstructed facilities will be operated and maintained by GEB. For each of\nthe two components under part B(cid:190) urban infrastructure, and rural infrastructure (water supply\nand sanitation)(cid:190) extensive capacity building of the responsible agencies, in particular the urban\nand rural departments, is essential. The initial operation and maintenance cost for one year after\nthe completion of such facilities may be financed under the Project.", "20\n13. Community Participation\n78. Beneficiary and community awareness and participation is essential to ensure that the\nrehabilitation  meets  their  requirements  and  needs,  and  that  the  local  beneficiaries  have\nownership. This aspect is particularly important in the wake of the disastrous earthquake that\nclaimed numerous lives and directly affected almost two million people through loss of their\nhousing and livelihood. For some communities, relocation of some residences to alternative\nsites may be required or desirable because of the complete destruction of homes and facilities\nand their location along seismic fault lines. The tradition of community awareness and NGO\nsupport  is  strong  in  the  affected  areas.  The  rural  local  government  system,  the  Gram\nPanchayat, already utilizes a public consultation and participation approach involving NGOs and\ncommunity organizations that will be strengthened and supported under the housing and rural\ninfrastructure components. GOG has made strong commitments to collaborate with suitable\nNGOs to carry out rehabilitation and reconstruction work at the local government level. Such\nNGOs  will  act  as  IAs  at  the  village  level  and  will  be  appropriately  compensated  for  their\nservices.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n79. The Project is classified as a Category B environmental project, as it is unlikely to have\nany  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Civil  works  will  involve  rehabilitation  and\nreconstruction of damaged or destroyed housing and infrastructure. Generally this will follow\nexisting alignments. For relocation of housing, the sites and services will be located near\nexisting cities, towns, or villages. Land will be acquired from public lands as far as possible. The\nheavily impacted areas of Kachchh, where this may be necessary, has low population density,\nlittle or no agricultural activity, and extensive space providing options for acquiring additional\nland. Any land acquisition and resettlement under the Project will be undertaken in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement (footnote 22). Hazardous waste from the debris, if\nany, will be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner satisfactory to ADB.\n80. All  subprojects  will  be  designed  to  follow  environmental  safeguards  and  technical\nspecifications  established  for  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects,  which  have  already  been\nsubjected to ADB\u2019s initial environmental examination procedures. The subprojects will follow the\nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  for  selected  infrastructure,  industrial,  and\npower development projects. If a subproject involves land acquisition or new alignments, the\nresponsible IA will submit an initial environmental examination for ADB\u2019s review and approval.\nH. The Proposed Technical Assistance\n1.  Objective and Scope\n81. The  objective  of  the  TA,  Capacity  Building  for  Earthquake  Rehabilitation  and\nReconstruction  of  Housing,  is  to  support  the  Panchayats,  Rural  Housing  and  Rural\nDevelopment Department (PRHD) and the Urban Development and Urban Housing Department\n(UDHD) in implementing GOG\u2019s reconstruction program for earthquake-damaged housing. The\nTA will help:\n(i)  PRHD and UDHD (a) upgrade standards, and (b) build capacity to develop and\nimplement regulatory systems and codes, land use planning, and zoning and\ndevelopment planning;\n(ii)  generate capacity for PRHD, UDHD, and their various supportive and agencies,\nand for NGOs to oversee the housing rehabilitation and reconstruction;", "21\n(iii)  implement the system for monitoring cash flow to confirm proper construction\nbefore release of funds; and\n(iv)  generate  techniques  and  simple  procedures  for  monitoring  the  structure  to\nconfirm  that  the  required  standards  and  construction  techniques  have  been\nincorporated.\n2.  Cost Estimates\n82. The cost of the TA is estimated at $1,650,000 equivalent, including $480,000 in foreign\nexchange cost and $1,170,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will provide $1,300,000\nequivalent  to  fund  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $820,000  equivalent  of  the  local\ncurrency cost on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. The Government and GOG\nwill contribute $350,000 equivalent in kind.\n3.  Implementation Arrangements\n83. The implementation office jointly established by PRHD and UDHD will be the Executing\nAgency. The TA consultants will also support and work closely with the districts, municipalities,\nvillage entities, and NGOs involved in housing reconstruction in the earthquake-affected areas.\nThe consultants will report directly to INRM and liaise closely with the project consultants and\nADB\u2019s extended mission in Gandhinagar.\n84. The TA will finance 115 person-months of consulting services: 15 person-months of\ninternational and 100 person-months of domestic consulting input. Expertise will include house\nand building construction, design of structures incorporating strengthening for earthquake and\ncyclone  resistance,  building  codes,  land  use  zoning,  urban  planning,  seismology,  and\nmicrozoning related to structural designs, disaster management, and training. The consultants\nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants on the basis of\nsimplified  technical  proposals.  Reports  will  be  prepared  on  a  quarterly  basis  summarizing\nprogress to date and work programs for the next quarter. The TA is expected to commence in\nJune 2001 and be completed by April 2002.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Impact on Poverty and Other Benefits\n85. The earthquake has been as much a socioeconomic disaster to individual households as\na disaster to physical infrastructure. About 1.3 million people in rural areas and 0.45 million in\nurban areas have been rendered homeless; many have lost all their basic survival necessities\nincluding clothing and household essentials. The 770,000 houses, destroyed or damaged in five\nof  the  worst  affected  districts  of  Jamnagar,  Kachchh,  Patan,  Rajkot,  and  Surendranagar,\naccount for nearly 45 percent of all households in these areas. Since damage is more intense in\ncertain villages and towns, the percentage of households affected in these locations would be\nmarkedly higher, implying that a higher percentage of the people have entered the ranks of the\npoor.  Considering  the  extent  of  damage,  the  cost  of  rebuilding  houses  and  infrastructure\nfacilities is exorbitant both for affected households and for the state. Support both in terms of\nfinancial  assistance  as  well  as  improved  earthquake  resistant  technology  would  be  of\nconsiderable benefit in protecting the poor and affected people from falling further into poverty.\nIt  would  help  families  resettle,  provide  a  safer  and  healthier  environment,  and  stabilize\nlivelihoods.", "22\n86. The  rehabilitation  of  urban  and  rural  infrastructure,  particularly  water  supply  and\nsanitation,  will  facilitate  the  provision  of  drinking  water,  reduce  the  risk  of  health-related\nproblems, and improve the quality of life. Support for physical reconstruction in key sectors like\npower  would  have  positive  secondary  effects  in  reviving  industries  and  agriculture.  By\nrehabilitating public and community infrastructure, the Project will help restore economic and\nsocial activities disrupted by the disaster.\n87. The Project envisages livelihood restoration that could help prevent the current adverse\neffects of the disaster on the affected poor. Livelihoods have been badly affected and this, along\nwith the destruction of household investments, has been draining meagre household savings\nand adversely impacting on levels of income and capability poverty in the region. The possibility\nof an adverse impact in terms of reduced consumption, migration, and increased child labor in\npoor family is increasing. The rehabilitation works will entail labor intensive civil works contracts,\nusing unskilled and semiskilled local labor, thereby providing employment opportunities for the\npoor. Livelihood rehabilitation for local artisans, craftsmen, and self-employed people in the\naffected area will facilitate recovery of the local economy, thereby restoring more long-term\nemployment opportunities. The Project\u2019s component for livelihood restoration will benefit poor\nfamilies as well as those forced into poverty by the disaster. The training envisaged for various\ncategories of skills would help in the economic and social rehabilitation of those severely\naffected, like the physically disabled and widows. The benefits of the Project will be evident\nthrough economic rehabilitation arising from speedy reconstruction of infrastructure and facilities\nand livelihood restoration in the earthquake-affected areas.\nB. Risks\n88. Risks related to the ambitious implementation period, and GOG\u2019s ability to assign the\nnecessary priorities, staff, and budgets could affect implementation of parts A, C, and D. Thus\nIAs to implement the Project must be experienced and the recovery strategy must be properly\nsequenced to distinguish between immediate and medium-term measures. In this way, scarce\nmanagerial and implementation capacity will be focused on priority issues and avoid spreading\navailable resources too thinly. For the Project, experienced IAs were selected, including GEB for\npower  sector  rehabilitation;  the  Panchayats,  Rural  Housing  and  Rural  Development\nDepartment, and GUDCO and the Urban Development and Urban Housing Department for\nparts C and B, respectively. Moreover, the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment,\nand the Industries and Mines Department, as IAs for part D, are already implementing livelihood\nsupport schemes and have adequate experience. Some risks are associated with part B in view\nof the large number of geographically dispersed urban localities, and the relative unfamiliarity\nwith the sector approach at the local level, which may delay progress in implementation. Strong\nconsultant support is therefore being provided for assistance with design and construction,\ntendering and bid evaluation, account maintenance, reporting, and audit. Moreover, consultant\nsupport for overall management of the rehabilitation project is provided to GSDMA. The risk of\ngovernance-related  issues  is  addressed  by  the  detailed  selection  criteria,  transparent\nimplementation and monitoring mechanisms, and specific financial controls including regular as\nwell as random audits. As discussed with GOG during appraisal and in meetings with the\nGovernment,  implementation  of  part  A  will  be  carried  out  under  proper  identification  and\naccounting procedures considering that the large number of beneficiaries under the housing\ncomponent will be individuals who have lost personal identification records and belongings in\nthe earthquake. Furthermore, with the proposed establishment of ADB\u2019s extended mission in\nGandhinagar (para. 46), ADB will play a proactive role in addressing implementation problems\nand in encouraging proper financial management.", "23\nVI. ASSURANCES\n89. The Government and GOG have given the following specific assurances, in addition to\nthe standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  GOG  will  ensure  that  all  facilities  rehabilitated  and  reconstructed  under  the\nProject are operated and maintained by GSDMA, and thereafter by the relevant\nagencies taking over from GSDMA after completion of the works. GOG will make\navailable, on a timely basis, the necessary funds for operation and maintenance\nof  all  the  rehabilitated  and  reconstructed  public  facilities  during  and  after\nimplementation.\n(ii) GOG will allocate, on a timely basis, adequate counterpart funds from its budget\nfor each fiscal year during project implementation.\n(iii) GOG  will  ensure  that  the  GSDMA  is  adequately  staffed  by  competent  and\nqualified personnel for the effective implementation of the Project.\n(iv) The PMCU and IAs will actively seek NGO and community involvement and\nparticipation  in  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  rehabilitation  and\nreconstruction of infrastructure under the Project.\n(v)  The Government will upon receipt of the loan proceeds immediately and fully\ntransfer such proceeds to the second-generation imprest account established by\nGSDMA. Such transfers will be treated as additional central plan assistance to\nGOG.\n(vi) GOG will ensure that the reconstruction of affected houses and other urban and\nmunicipal  infrastructure  under  the  Project  will  proceed,  incorporating\nstrengthened  seismic,  high  wind  (cyclone),  earthquake,  and  flood  resistant\nspecifications and provisions. To this extent, GOG will monitor and ensure quality\ncontrol  of  the  construction,  materials  to  be  used  in  the  reconstruction  of\ninfrastructure and houses, and clearing and approval of contractors and builders\nfor the reconstruction, where applicable.\n(vii)  GOG will initiate administrative approvals to ensure compulsory comprehensive\ninsurance  of  reconstructed  public  infrastructure  and  housing  property,  and\nencourage  similar  insurance  for  private  property;  this  will  include  insurance\nagainst natural calamities such as earthquake, cyclones, and flood.\n(viii) GOG will ensure and monitor that proper audit and accounting procedures are in\nplace  to  ensure  efficient  and  economical  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  for  the\nbeneficiaries. Accounts and financial statements in relation to the Project and\nsubprojects  will  be  maintained  and  certified  by  independent  private  auditors\nacceptable to ADB. GSDMA, through GOG, will provide to ADB (i) reports on\nsuch accounts and financial statements on a quarterly basis within 45 days of the\nclose of each quarter, and (ii) accounts and financial statements as audited and\ncertified, on a semiannual basis within 60 days of the close of each semiannual\nperiod. The Government and GOG will allow ADB representatives to carry out\nspot or random checks on flow of funds through the imprest account, to be\nmaintained by the Government, and the second-generation imprest account, to\nbe maintained by GSDMA.", "24\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n90. I am satisfied that the proposed loan and technical assistance would comply with the\nArticles of Agreement of ADB and recommend that the Board approve:\n(i)  the loan of $500,000,000 from ADB's ordinary capital resources to India for the\nGujarat Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, with a term of 30\nyears, including a grace period of 7 years, and with interest to be determined in\naccordance with ADB's pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar\nloans, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance\nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the\nBoard; and\n(ii)  the provision of technical assistance on a grant basis in an amount not exceeding\nthe equivalent of $1,300,000 to the Government of India for Capacity Building for\nEarthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Housing.\nTADAO CHINO\n      President \n16 March 2001", "25\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 Housing 26 9, 32\n2 Urban Infrastructure 29 9, 33\n3 Rural Infrastructure (Water Supply and Sanitation) 32 9, 33\n4 Power 35 9, 34\n5 Livelihood Rehabilitation 37 9, 35\n6 Multihazard Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation 39 9, 37\n7 Summary of Cost Estimates 42 10, 41\n8 Organization Chart 43 13, 48\n9 Outline Terms of Reference for Consulting Services 44 16, 61\n10 Implementation Schedule 49 18, 72\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\nA Socioeconomic Indicators of Gujarat and the Worst Earthquake-Affected Districts of the\nState\nB Poverty Assessment\nC Gujarat Earthquake Damage\nD External Assistance for Relief\nE Detailed Description of Part A\nF Detailed Description of Part B (Urban)\nG Detailed Description of Part B (Rural)\nH Detailed Description of Part F\nI Detailed Terms of Reference for Consulting Services\nJ Assessment Report \u2013 A Joint Report by the World Bank and the Asian Development\nBank, March 2001", "26\nAppendix 1, page 1\nHOUSING\nA. Rationale\n1. The earthquake caused damage to civil structures, in particular to houses in 21 of the 25\ndistricts  in  the  Gujarat  State.  The  impact  was  most  severe  in  Kachchh  district,  although\nAhmedabad, Jamnagar, Patan, Rajkot, and Surendranagar districts also experienced extensive\ndamage to human lives and property. The destruction in Kachchh was massive. The most\nseverely affected subdistricts (talukas) were Anjar, Bhachau, Bhuj, Gandhidham and Rapar.\nTens of thousands of structures completely collapsed, while the remaining have either been\ndamaged or developed cracks rendering them unsafe for occupation. The indicative dimensions\nof the damage in rural and urban areas are summarized here:1\n1. Rural Housing\n2. The rural population comprises 65 percent (27 million) of the state population. The total\nhouseholds in rural Gujarat prior to the earthquake numbered 4.8 million. The majority of the\npeople in rural areas reside in kachha (stone rubble masonry set in mud mortar with structural\nroof)  or  semipucca  (same  as  kachha  but  with  thatch  roof)  houses.  The  earthquake  has\ndamaged or destroyed housing in 1,100 villages. According to preliminary estimates, about\n180,700 houses have collapsed completely and 413,000 are partially damaged. In addition,\nabout 110,000 huts have been destroyed and another 75,000 huts partially damaged.\n2. Urban Housing\n3. The estimated number of housing units affected in larger towns and municipalities is\n23,979 and 117,666 respectively.\n3. Indirect Damage\n4. The earthquake rendered over 300,000 rural families homeless. Further, due to the\ncontinuing  aftershocks,  most  of  the  other  400,000  households,  whose  houses  have  been\npartially damaged, are afraid to reoccupy their houses. These households have also lost most of\ntheir personal effects, including property deeds, bank statements and other valuables. The\nGovernment of Gujarat (GOG) estimates the loss of personal effects to exceed $1 billion. The\nquake has led to a sharp drop in market prices and demand for apartments in multistory\nbuildings in all cities and towns. A further impact is on the housing finance sector. In many\ncases the value of damaged housing is insufficient collateral for the housing finance companies\nand other financial institutions holding the loans. GOG has therefore taken steps to ensure that\naffected families are protected.\nB. Gujarat Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program for Housing\n5. GOG has prepared a comprehensive rehabilitation and reconstruction program including\nhousing  reconstruction.  As  an  immediate  measure,  GOG  has  announced  a  preliminary\nrehabilitation and reconstruction package for housing.\n6. A detailed assessment of the degree of destruction of the housing stock is currently\nbeing undertaken. Discussions are also under way with the residents of the 256 villages that\nwere completely destroyed to determine if relocation is favored over reconstruction at the\ncurrent site (in situ reconstruction). In all cases, when reconstruction is to take place, rubble\n                                                \n1 Detailed assessment on a house by house basis is now under way by trained teams to update the numbers.", "27\nAppendix 1, page 2\nremoval  must  be  carried  out  with  due  regard  to  the  foundation  conditions  required  for\nearthquake resistance.\nC. Project Scope\n7. The  Project  comprises  reconstruction  of  damaged  houses  of  the  poorer  segments\nincluding (i) all huts, (ii) economically weaker section, and (iii) lower income group (LIG) houses,\nup to a maximum unit size of 50 square metres (m2).2 Repair of such housing units will also be\nundertaken  to  facilitate  early  rehabilitation  and  avoidable  displacement  of  people  in  the\ndamaged houses. This is essential for livelihood restoration and economic activity rejuvenation\nin the area. Geographically the focus will be on housing in the rural areas.\n8. The initial rehabilitation policy announced by GOG will provide grants for rebuilding\nhouses  and  shelters.  Given  the  enhanced  cost  of  building  earthquake  resistant  houses,\nminimum grant of about $900 equivalent per unit in rural areas has been proposed, which would\nenable replacing huts with earthquake resistant structures. An examination of the vulnerability\nmaps for the region3 indicates that 52 percent of the houses in Jamnagar, 70 percent in\nKachchh, 48.8 percent in Rajkot, and 85.5 percent in Surendranagar have a Category A type of\nstructure  using  unburned  bricks,  clay,  and  field  stone,  all  of  which  have  low  earthquake\nresistance.  The  CASHPOR  House  Index4  indicates  that  semipermanent  materials  for  the\nconstruction of various parts of a house are also indicators of poverty.\n9. For the lower income group with a house size of up to 50m2, the extent of assistance will\nbe a maximum of Rs90,000. Based on available data, 40 percent of the affected households fall\ninto the lower income group.\nD. Cost Estimates\n10. The total cost for house reconstruction under the Project is estimated at $250 million\nequivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost component comprises 12 percent or $30 million\nwhile the equivalent local currency cost is $220 million (Table A1). The proposed loan of $200\nmillion will finance all of the foreign exchange cost and $170 million equivalent of the local\ncurrency costs. GOG will finance the remaining local currency costs of $50 million equivalent.\nTable A1: Cost Estimate and Financing Plan for Housing Reconstruction\n($ million)\nItem Foreign Local ADB GOG Total\nExchange Currency Financing Financing Cost\nReconstruction and rehabilitation 30 220 200 50 250\nTotal 30 220 200 50 250\nPercent 12 88 80 20 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, GOG = Government of Gujarat.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n                                                \n2 This covers rehabilitation packages No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 of GOG\u2019s Resolution No. PNV-162001-1502 (1)- S.3,\ndated 23 February 2001.\n3 Government of India. 1997.

The Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA) will be the Executing Agency\n(EA) for the Project. The Panchayats, Rural Housing, and Rural Development Department will be\nthe Implementing Agency for the rural housing. A project implementation unit will be established\nunder the PRHD. The unit will implement a beneficiary registration system including issuance of\npicture identification before release of the second payment for the housing component.\nF. Disbursement of Loan Proceeds\n12. Disbursement procedures will be in accordance with Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB)\nLoan Disbursement Handbook. An initial imprest advance commensurate with requirements will\nbe  provided.  ADB's  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  be  followed  for  the\nreimbursements of expenditures, and for the liquidation of the imprest account for payment.\nG. Implementation Schedule\n13. Implementation will commence in April 2001 and is expected to be completed during\n2002.\nH. Consulting Services\n14. Consulting services will be required to monitor the quality of construction of new housing\nunits, with particular reference to incorporation of earthquake-resistant features. This monitoring\nwill  involve  domestic  consultants,  government  and  supportive/facilitating  nongovernment\norganizations and other representation from the local community. They will be responsible for\nchecking quality and costs, and will signoff on all progress claims by contractors or individuals.\nApproximately 3,600 person-months of consulting input for about $5 million are required. Should\nGOG decide to retain the 3,000 engineers and technicians currently being fielded to conduct\ndamage assessments, they could be financed from this contract.\n15.  The outline terms of reference for the consulting services are provided in Appendix 9.", "29\nAppendix 2, page 1\nURBAN INFRASTRUCTURE\nA. Rationale\n1. The earthquake impacted 21 of the 25 districts of Gujarat. While 80 percent of the\ndamage was in 4 districts, the impact on the urban municipal infrastructure varied widely.\nFifteen towns in Kachchh, Rajkot, Surendranagar districts and Ahmedabad corporation suffered\nsevere damage. In Kachchh, the municipalities and cities particularly affected were Bhuj, Anjar,\nRapar, Bhachau, Gandhidham, and Mandvi; in Rajkot: Morvi and Wankaner; in Surendranagar:\nSurendranagar, Limdi, Thangadh, Dhrangdhara, Halwad, and Wadhwan; and in Ahmedabad:\nAhmedabad.\n2. Further to the ongoing relief efforts focusing on food, medical care, and temporary\nshelters,  essential  services  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation  need  to  be  improved  on\nimmediately. The lack of basic amenities such as water and sanitation, closure of commercial\nactivities, damaged municipal buildings, lack of health centers, and damaged schools, are\ncreating  extreme  hardship  for  those  affected.  The  Project  will  help  install  the  immediately\nrequired  minimum  services  to  sustain  life  for  those  affected,  while  rehabilitation  and\nreconstruction of all facilities are carried out over the next 33 months.\nB. Objective and Scope\n3. The main objective of this project component is to finance both the immediately required\nminimum services, and the reconstruction of all services, incorporating multihazard resistance\nfor earthquake, cyclone, and drought, which are all prevalent in the affected areas. All the\ndamage  to  urban  infrastructure  caused  by  the  recent  earthquake  will  be  eligible.  Eligible\nsubcomponents include water supply, treatment, and distribution; wastewater collection and\ntreatment; sanitation; solid waste management; drains; roads and street lighting; municipal and\npublic  buildings;  municipal  markets;  community  center;  library;  fire  brigade  complex  and\nequipment; tax collection post; stores and godowns and related equipment and facilities; and\nrubble removal and disposal. The scope and cost of this component will be adjusted through\ndetailed planning, damage assessments, surveys, and designs.\n4. In the most severely affected towns of Anjar, Bhachau, Bhuj, Rapar, Gandhidham, and\nMorvi, the densely populated town core areas were completely devastated.1 The water supply\nsystem is severely damaged; civil structures, pumps and motors, bore wells, and generator sets\nneed major repairs, and in many cases complete replacement. The sewerage system piping is\ndamaged, and drains are destroyed. At many of the sites, the electrical lines have snapped. The\nroads are generally intact except for minor damage to the pavement structures. In addition to\nthese areas, other towns suffered various degrees of damage. Ahmedabad, the state capital\nwas also damaged, though less severely.\n5. The overall damage assessment, scope, and cost estimates were based on a thorough\non-site evaluation by a joint Asian Development Bank (ADB)/World Bank team, supported by\nstate, district, and local officials. Anjar with a prequake population of 77,000 is typical of the six\nworst hit towns; 4,000 people died, 35,000 were injured, and more than 6,000 houses were\nseverely  damaged  or  outright  destroyed,  making  30,000  people  homeless.  Based  on  this\ndetailed analysis, government teams updated their initial assessment in the other affected\ntowns.\n                                                \n1 Restructuring of these areas will need to follow proper planning including widening of streets and increase in\nminimum lot size.", "30\nAppendix 2, page 2\n6. The city core (5 of the 12 municipal wards) of Anjar, with a prequake population of about\n25,000, suffered severe damage to all buildings, and urban infrastructure. Anjar\u2019s water supply\nsystem consists of a network of 15 deep bore wells, sumps, multistage pumps, overhead\nreservoirs, and a 45 kilometer (km) long distribution network of asbestos cement and polyvinyl\nchloride pipes. Reconstruction works include replacement of 8 bore wells, the water disinfection\nand chlorination plant, pumping house, and about 25 km of the water distribution piping network\nranging from 75 millimeter (mm) to 450 mm diameter, some 50 percent of the total will have to\nbe relaid using earthquake resistant pipe material such as cast or ductile iron. Three high\nground-level reservoirs have developed cracks and will require a thorough investigation to\ndetermine their structural integrity. All related civil structures will be reconstructed incorporating\nearthquake and cyclone resistance.\n7. The sewerage system in Anjar, consisting of open gutters, utility holes, and 66 km of\ngravity sewers (150 to 450 mm diameters, mainly reinforced concrete cement and glaced stone\nware) has suffered extensive cracks and damage. The extent of damage to the reticulation has\nto be confirmed using appropriate equipment. A conservative estimate indicates that half of the\nsewerage network will have to be relaid.\nC. Cost Estimate\n8. The total cost of the component is $86 million equivalent as summarized in Table A2:\nabout 20 percent ($17 million) for foreign exchange costs and 80 percent ($69 million) for local\ncurrency costs.\nTable A2: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Estimated Cost\nA.

The  Gujarat  State  Disaster  Management  Authority  (GSDMA)  will  assume\nimplementation of all components under the Project, including urban infrastructure, through its\nProject Management and Coordination Unit (PMCU), which will be the Executing Agency. Under\nthe PMCU, the Gujarat Urban Development Company (GUDCO),2 a semiautonomous financing\nand implementation utility under Urban Development and Urban Housing Department of the\nGujarat Government, will be the Implementing Agency for this component. GUDCO will assign a\nsenior level project director and a core group of experienced specialists from line departments\n                                                \n2 GUDCO  will  also  receive  training,  standard  bidding  documents,  and  instructions  on  ADB\u2019s  procurement,\nmonitoring, reporting, and other procedures from the project management consultant supporting the PMCU.", "31\nAppendix 2, page 3\nor by hiring new staff to implement this project component. GUDCO will work closely with the\nGujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board, the parastatal utility responsible for bulk water\nsupply to both urban and rural areas, and with the local municipal committees to ensure their full\ninvolvement.\nE. Consulting Services\n10. GUDCO will be assisted by a team of domestic design and construction supervision\nconsultants reporting to the project director. The consultants will have expertise in detailed\ndamage assessments, surveys, planning, design, specifications, bidding, quality control, and\ncontract management including institutional strengthening and capacity building support. The\nconsultants will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other\narrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  About  426\nperson-months of professional consulting input, and 880 person-months of technical input will\nbe required, at an estimated cost of $3.3 million. The areas of expertise include team leader and\nmunicipal engineer, procurement specialists, water supply and wastewater engineers, contract\nmanagement specialist, earthquake engineer, construction engineers, construction inspectors,\nand quantity surveyors. Outline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 9.\nF. Implementation Schedule\n11. Implementation of the immediate requirements is ongoing and will be completed by June\n2001, before the monsoon, following procedures acceptable to ADB. Recruitment of consultants\ncommenced and full scale operation is expected to start in July 2001, with completion by\nDecember 2003, as indicated in Appendix 10.", "32\nAppendix 3, page 1\nRURAL INFRASTRUCTURE (WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION)\nA. Rationale\n1. While 80 percent of the quake-damage was in the four districts of Ahmedabad, Kachchh,\nRajkot, and Surendranagar, the impact on the bulk water supply and village water systems\nvaried widely among the affected districts. Of 1,100 villages in these four districts, 256 were\ncompletely destroyed and the remaining 850 suffered varying degrees of damage. Furthermore,\nwater supply for both villages and towns, consisting mostly of well fields and related pipeline\nand  infrastructure,  were  severely  damaged.  The  Project  will  help  provide  the  immediately\nrequired basic services improvement, while rehabilitation and reconstruction of all facilities are\ncarried out.\nB. Objective and Scope\n2. The main objective of this component is to finance restoration of the bulk and rural water\nsupply systems, incorporating multihazard resistance against earthquake, cyclone, and drought,\nwhich are prevalent throughout the area.\n3. All the damage caused by the recent earthquake will be eligible for Asian Development\nBank (ADB) assistance. The damages were assessed by the joint ADB and World Bank team\nsupported by the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB). The main scope of the\nbulk and rural water supply component includes\n(i)  restoring temporary water supply by providing tankers, tractors/trailers, diesel\ngenerator (DG) sets, and mobile laboratory units;\n(ii)  repairing 400 deep tubewells and pumping installations;\n(iii)  conducting detailed leak detection, and  repairs or replacement;\n(iv)  rehabilitating local distribution systems in 1,100 villages;\n(v)  replacing an estimated 2,000 kilometer (km) of asbestos cement transmission\npipelines with metallic pipes (mild steel, ductile iron) which are less susceptible to\nearthquake effects; and\n(vi)  providing  institutional  strengthening,  capacity  building,  damage  assessment\nsurveys and acquifer exploration study, and domestic design and construction\nsupervision.\nC. Cost Estimate\n4. The rehabilitation and reconstruction cost of the bulk and rural water supply component\nis estimated at $132 million equivalent as summarized in Table A3. About 21 percent (i.e.,\n$28 million) is for foreign exchange costs and 79 percent (i.e., $104 million) local currency\ncosts.", "33\nAppendix 3, page 2\nTable A3: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Estimated Cost\nA.

Implementation Arrangement\n5. The Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA) will be responsible for\nimplementation of all project components, including bulk and rural water supply, through the\nProject Management and Coordination Unit (PMCU), which will be the Executing Agency. Under\nthe PMCU, the GWSSB,1 a parastatal utility under the State Water Supply Department, will be\nthe Implementing Agency for the component. GWSSB has assigned a senior project director\nand  a  core  group  of  experienced  specialists  to  oversee  implementation.  GWSSB  and  the\nconsultants will interact closely with the Gujarat Urban Development Company (GUDCO), the\ndistrict, town, and village administrators and civic society to ensure beneficiary participation.\n6. For towns and villages that operate and maintain their own internal distribution systems,\nthe  Community  Management  and  Support  Unit,  previously  established  by  GWSSB  with\nassistance  from  the  Government  of  Netherlands,  will  ensure  that  communities  participate\nactively in planning, design, and monitoring of works.\nE. Consulting Services\n7. GWSSB will be assisted by a team of domestic design and construction supervision\nconsultants,  reporting  to  the  project  director,  and  providing  expertise  in  detailed  damage\nassessments, surveys, planning, designs, specifications, bidding, quality control, and general\ncontract  management,  including  training  of  local  village  operators.  The  consultants  will  be\nrecruited  following  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and  other  arrangements\nacceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will provide\nabout 389 person-months of professional input, and 1,000 months of inspector and quantity\nsurveyor support, at an estimated cost of $2.3 million. The specific expertise includes team\nleader  and  water  supply  engineer,  procurement  specialist,  hydrogeologist  and  acquifer\nspecialist,  contract  management  specialist,  leak  detection  expert,  management  information\nsystem and information technology specialist, earthquake engineer, construction engineers,\nquantity surveyors and support staff.

Implementation Schedule\n8. Implementation of the immediate requirements is ongoing and will be completed by June\n2001, following procedures acceptable to ADB. Recruitment of consultants has commenced and\nfull scale operation is expected to start in the second quarter of 2001, with completion by end-\n2003, as indicated in Appendix 10.", "35\nAppendix 4, page 1\nPOWER\nA. Rationale\n1. While some of the thermal power stations (Kachchh Lignite Thermal Power Station, the\nSikka  Thermal  Power  Station,  and  the  Dhuvaran  Thermal  Power  Station)  suffered  minor\ndamage, the transmission and distribution systems in Banaskatha, Jamnagar, Kachchh, Rajkot,\nand Surendranagar districts were severely affected. In particular, damage occurred at the 220\nkilovolt (kV) substations at Anjar, Nakhatrana, and Nani Kakhar, at two 132 kV substations (Bhuj\nand  Samkhyali),  and  at  44  substations  at  66  kV  level  in  Bhuj,  Jamnagar,  Rajkot,  and\nSurendranagar. Control rooms collapsed, power transformers toppled over, and equipment was\ndamaged. Extensive damage also occurred to the distribution system (11 kV feeders and 0.415\nkV low-tension lines), affecting most of the villages in the region. Disruption of power supply\nimpacts on the provision of normal basic services, particularly water supply and sanitation.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n2. The objective of the Project is to restore reliable and efficient power supply to the\naffected areas. The project scope includes (i) replacement of damaged equipment, construction\nof substation buildings, and houses for the operating staff; and (ii) renovation and strengthening\nof the transmission and distribution systems. This will enable the Gujarat Electricity Board\n(GEB) to achieve the level of service provided prior to the earthquake.\n3. Existing designs of the power system are not appropriate to effectively minimize the\nimpact of earthquake. Therefore, replaced assets will need to incorporate technologies for\nearthquake resistance. However, as the replacement of damaged (old) equipment will create an\nimbalance  in  reliability  of  different  parts  of  the  system,  renovation  and  strengthening  of\ntransmission lines and substations will be required to ensure matching reliability of the power\nsystem. Moreover, technical systems upgrading will be required to improve efficiency by (i)\nconverting the low-tension feeders to the more efficient high-tension system; and (ii) installing\ncapacitors and meters.\nC. Cost Estimates\n4.  The total cost of the Project for the power sector component is estimated at $97.9 million\nequivalent as summarized in Table A4. The estimate is based on a detailed analysis of the\ndamages caused, cost of replacement equipment and materials, and the number of buildings\nand staff quarters that need reconstruction.\nTable A4: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Estimated Cost\nGeneration System 2.8\nTransmission System 36.1\nDistribution System 35.7\nCivil Works 11.5\nSubtotal 86.1\nPhysical and Price Contingencies 11.8\nTotal 97.9", "36\nAppendix 4, page 2\nD. Implementing Arrangements\n5. GEB will be the Implementing Agency for the power sector component of the Project. A\nGEB task force will be constituted to oversee implementation. The task force will operate under\nthe overall guidance of the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA). The Asian\nDevelopment Bank Cell of GEB will be responsible for procurement; assistance to supervision\nstaff  in  implementation;  overall  management,  coordination,  and  oversight;  audit  of  project\naccounts and financial statements, and preparation of regular progress reports and project\ncompletion reports. The heads of the Civil, Transmission, Distribution and Generation divisions\nof GEB will be responsible for implementing the subprojects under their respective divisions.\nE. Consulting Services\n6. For the power sector component, a total of 24 person-months of domestic consulting\nservices  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $0.15  million  equivalent  will  be  required  to  prepare  the\nspecifications  and  designs  of  the  foundations,  substation  buildings,  houses,  and  site\nsupervision. The consultant should be an experienced structural design engineer, with particular\nexperience in the design of multidisaster resistant structures.", "37\nAppendix 5, page 1\nLIVELIHOOD REHABILITATION\nA. Rationale\n1. The earthquake has disrupted the economy of the affected areas through widespread\ndamages to the assets, tools, implements, raw materials, and work places, and of human capital\nitself. The main economic activities in the affected areas included dry-land farming, animal\nhusbandry, handicrafts, handlooms, salt production, construction, and other trades including\ngems and jewelry. Livelihoods of not only the existing poor, but of many others who had a\nfragile economic stability, have now been adversely affected.\nB.  Objectives\n2. Livelihoods  have  been  affected  and  packages  for  restoration  will  have  to  address\nvarious categories differently. The needs of the affected can be broadly grouped under three\ncategories: (i) livelihood restoration through financial and infrastructure support, (ii) livelihood\nrestoration through retraining, and (iii) economic compensation for loss of livelihood.\n3. Livelihood  Restoration  through  Financial  and  Infrastructure  Support.  This  will\ncover the categories of affected persons whose skill base is intact, but who need support in\nterms of restoration of assets, tools, and work places. This category will require support in terms\nof  supply  of  tool  kits,  seed  money,  and  assistance  in  marketing  for  some  interim  period.\nLivelihood restoration support requirements include (i) replacement of tools and facilities lost, (ii)\nproduction credit to cover the cost of basic materials, and (iii) marketing support.\n4. Livelihood Restoration through Retraining. Many women have been left destitute by\nthe quake and over 2,500 families are left with members with permanent disabilities. Many\nfamilies of the 200,000 injured have also been left with members with physical disabilities that\nrequire a change in economic activity to more sedentary jobs. In the case of such households,\nthe issue is to build up a skill base to equip them to take up economic activities in the first place\nbefore providing financial and infrastructure support. Comprehensive training programs have to\nbe carried out for destitute women and other family members in the case of the disabled. A\nrestoration program will require (i) training of young women and other family members to\nreplace those who have died or been permanently disabled, (ii) alternate means of employment\nto  the  physically  handicapped  who  have  to  give  up  existing  lines  of  employment  but  can\nmanage to be economically active, and (iii) provision of production credit to cover the cost of\nbasic materials and seed money for alternate work.\n5. Economic Compensation for Loss of Livelihood. Many children have been orphaned\nand old people left without support as a result of the quake. In these categories the situation is\none of total loss of family economic livelihood with no scope for restoring it. This class of\ndependants needs to be economically provided for their basic needs by the state until some of\nthe children are old enough to receive vocational training.\nC. Scope\n6.  This project component will cover livelihood restoration for categories (i) and (ii) in para.\n2. The trades to be covered will include artisans, craftsmen, handicraft workers, small traders,\nand skills suitable to the sociocultural and economic milieu of the specific areas for the destitute\nwomen and handicapped. Many dry land farmers, salt pan workers, and those engaged in", "38\nAppendix 5, page 2\nanimal husbandry are also affected. The Government of Gujart (GOG) is already in touch with\nthe  national  Government  for  additional  support  through  centrally  sponsored  and  assisted\nschemes. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have also indicated interest in providing\nsupport, particularly for salt pan workers. Large-scale reconstruction activity for housing is to be\ntaken up under the Project. Construction workers, including masons, carpenters, plumbers, and\nelectricians  will  be  gainfully  employed  in  the  process.  A  specific  component  for  tool-kit\ndistribution, construction of work places, and marketing support is being included. The Project\nwill  also  support  training  programs  and  restoration  of  livelihoods  for  destitute  women  and\ndisabled persons.\nD. Cost Estimates\n7. The total cost estimate is based on information on unit cost for individual components\nsuch as tool-kits and work place. The total cost estimate is $20 million as detailed in Table A5.\nTable A5: Livelihood Restoration Projects\nDepartment of Industries & Mines Rs million $ million\nManav Kalyan Yojana 25 0.5\nToolkits for 10,000 artisans (Rs2,500 each)\nHandicraft artisans 100 2.2\nToolkits for 10,000 artisans (Rs10,000 each)\nHandloom weavers 24 0.5\nToolkits for 2,400 weavers (Rs10,000 each)\nWorking capital support (through NGOs) 150 3.3\nPermanent workshed\nWorkshed (10 x 10 ft) for 7,000 artisans 140 3.0\nWorkshed (10 x 17ft) for 2,500 artisans (tie and dye, block prints etc) 63 1.3\n502 10.8\nDepartment of Social Justice and Empowerment\nAssistance for Disabled (6,500 persons) 225 4.8\nViklang Sahay Yojana/Ashta Vakra Scheme\nDestitute women (training, tools, and marketing support) 150 3.2\n375 8.0\nContingency 55 1.2\nTotal 932 20.0\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n8. The Department of Industries and Mines will be the Implementing Agency for livelihood\nrestoration of artisans, weavers, and small traders. The Department of Social Justice and\nEmpowerment will be the Implementing Agency for training and livelihood restoration for the\ndisabled  persons  and  destitute  women.  These  two  main  agencies  have  been  identified  in\nconsultation with GOG.\nF. Implementation Schedule\n9. Implementation is expected to commence in April 2001 and be completed by end-2003.", "39\nAppendix 6, page 1\nMULTIHAZARD DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND MITIGATION\nA.  Rationale\n1. Gujarat  is  prone  to  a  variety  of  natural  hazards,  including  cyclones,  drought,  and\nearthquake.  Due to its extensive industrialization, and being home to a significant percentage of\nIndia\u2019s chemical industry, it also faces industrial and chemical hazards. Therefore, the state\u2019s\nDisaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Program  (DMMP)  must  necessarily  be  multihazard-\nfocused and broad-based, dealing with preparedness (predisaster activities to develop and\nmaintain capabilities to respond rapidly and effectively to disasters) and mitigation (activities to\nreduce disaster risk and minimize impact of consequences), besides relief and recovery.\n2. The current earthquake and the Government of Gujarat (GOG) response to it revealed\nweaknesses in communication systems; availability of trained human resources and equipment;\nprearranged  systems  for  mobilizing  response  resources;  government  and  community\nawareness  of  hazards;  response  actions  and  mitigation  measures;  and  mechanisms  for\nincorporating hazard resistance into structures, infrastructure, and planning.\n3. On  6  February  2001,  GOG  established  the  Gujarat  State  Disaster  Management\nAuthority (GSDMA), with the following aims and objectives:\n(i)  provide relief against natural calamities and restore normalcy through social and\nfinancial activities for rehabilitation and reconstruction;\n(ii)  prepare  and  implement  programs  to  early  warning  to  natural  disasters  and\nminimize its impact;\n(iii)  assess reasons behind natural disasters and recommend solutions; and\n(iv)  coordinate assistance from various resources and agencies including multilateral\nand bilateral agencies, public and private sector, nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs), and individuals, and ensure efficient and transparent use of funds.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n4. The  main  objective  of  this  component  is  to  (i)  initially  build  GSDMA\u2019s  capacity  to\nundertake the immediate reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts; and (ii) develop GSDMA\u2019s\ninstitutional capacity to become an apex organization and focal point for multidisaster-related\nefforts and issues in the state, from prevention and mitigation, to relief and reconstruction.\n5. GSDMA will have two distinct but interrelated units to serve its dual functions:1\n(i)  The Earthquake Reconstruction Management Division (ERMD) will serve as the\nproject management unit for the reconstruction program. ERMD will serve as\nExecuting Agency for the loan projects from multilateral and bilateral agencies. In\nview of the enormity of the task, ERMD will require necessary support to build\ncapacity to manage such a program.\n                                                \n1 An international consulting firm has been tasked to prepare the detailed organizational structure including staffing,\nas well as preparing the specifications for management information system and financial management system.", "40\nAppendix 6, page 2\n(ii)  The Disaster Management Division (DMD) has as its main task to develop and\nimplement the DMMP for all hazards faced by the state. While in the initial\nperiod, DMD will also provide technical support to the implementation of the\nreconstruction  program,  by  the  end  of  the  reconstruction  program,  the  core\ntechnical departments from the reconstruction program would come under this\ndivision.\n6. The scope of work includes\n(i) preparation  of  a  multihazard  DMMP  (risk  analysis  comprising  hazards  and\nvulnerability assessments; inventory of response resources; standard operating\nprocedures (SOPs) on early warning, alert, warning dissemination, and activation\nof response; and SOPs for response action including search and rescue, medical\naid,  relief  supply,  emergency  shelter,  health  and  sanitation,  infrastructure\nrestoration, and damage and needs assessment);\n(ii) disaster  management  information  system  (detailed  district  assessment  of\nhazards, vulnerabilities, response resources, and capacities; and vulnerability of\nhousing and critical infrastructure);\n(iii) disaster  management  training  (capacity  building  and  training  on  disaster\nmanagement, and developing capacity for delivering training);\n(iv) drought mitigation program (develop and implement a comprehensive drought\nmitigation  program  that  includes  practical  methods  of  water  conservation,\nrainwater harvesting, appropriate changes in cropping patterns, and livestock\nprotection);\n(v)  disaster  management  control  rooms  and  communications  network  (phased\nprogram to establish a district disaster control room in each district headquarters\nand a statewide communications network);\n(vi)  enhancement of first responder capacity (program to upgrade search and rescue\ncapacities in urban areas; and development and training of community-based\nfirst response teams);\n(vii)  community-based  disaster  management  program  (training  of  disaster\npreparedness  volunteers  in  the  dissemination  of  warning,  assistance  in\nevacuation, rescue and first aid, and mitigation program geared to protecting and\nincorporating disaster resistance in community and family assets);\n(viii) urban disaster management program (development of a city-level mitigation and\npreparedness  program,  building  on  capacity  in  the  local  bodies  through\nestablishment of a disaster management cell and citywide disaster management\ncommittee); and\n(ix) cyclone  preparedness  program  (warning  system  improvement,  warning\ndissemination, and community volunteer-based evacuation system by identifying\nbuildings that could serve as cyclone shelters and a system of community-based\nvolunteers to disseminate warnings and facilitate evacuation).", "41\nAppendix 6, page 3\nC. Cost Estimate\n7. The total cost of this component is estimated at $20 million. The cost includes about $4\nmillion  for  consulting  capacity  building  and  training,  and  $16  million  for  basic  disaster\nmanagement equipment and structures.\nD. Implementation Arrangement\n8. GSDMA will be the Executing Agency for this component. GSDMA will appoint a project\ndirector to coordinate all the activities related to this component, within GSDMA and outside of it\nwith  other  government,  public  and  private  agencies,  and  NGOs.
