INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to enhance policies \nand planning of small cities, towns, and villages in Jiangxi province toward more balanced, \ninclusive, and environmentally sustainable development.1 During a TA fact-finding mission on \n29 August 2015, agreement was reached with the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, costs, financing plan, and outline terms of reference for the \nconsulting services of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Urbanization has been a key driver of development in the PRC. The emerging urban and \nagglomeration economies have contributed greatly to the PRC\u2019s significant growth since the \ngovernment  started  its  opening  up  and  reform  policies  in  the  early  1980s.  The  PRC's \nurbanization ratio increased from 19.4% in 1978 to 53.7% in 2013, and the urban population \nrose to nearly 700 million in 2013. The number of cities increased from 193 in 1978 to 658 in \n2013, and the number of townships increased from 2,173 to 20,113 in the same period. With \nrural\u2013urban migration expected to continue, the PRC\u2019s urban population is projected to grow to \n816 million by 2020 and to more than 1 billion by 2030. Industrial and urban development has \nlifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and generated a growing middle class. \nHowever, significant regional imbalances and urban\u2013rural disparities are contributing to severe \nsocioeconomic challenges, including a growing urban\u2013rural income gap (at a factor of 2.75 in \n2014) and restricted access to education, training, jobs, health, and social security for rural \npeople and for rural\u2013urban migrants with rural hukou.3 Balancing and integrating urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment in the PRC and mitigating the socioeconomic disparity\u2014including gaps in incomes, \nservices, and infrastructure, and inequality of access to social welfare because of the dual \nhukou system\u2014are among the key development challenges recognized by the PRC leadership \nand are addressed in the proposed actions of the PRC\u2019s National New-type Urbanization Plan \n(2014\u20132020).4 The plan indicates a shift from development based on gross domestic product \ngrowth toward development based on quality, which includes (i) green and inclusive cities; (ii) \nbalanced  and  integrated  urban\u2013rural  development;  (iii)  city  cluster  development  through \neconomic and infrastructure development coordination through a central triangle city cluster \nanchored in Wuhan (Hubei province), Changsha (Hunan province), and Nanchang (Jiangxi \nprovince); and (iv) shift towards a more ecologically conscious and sustainable society. \n \n3.  Despite a robust agriculture sector, general development in Jiangxi lags behind other \nprovinces  in  the  PRC,  with  significant  poverty  in  rural  areas.  Jiangxi  has  a  population  of \n45 million, 51.1% of whom are from rural areas, and the poverty rate across the province is 5% \nhigher than the national average. Jiangxi has 11 municipalities and urban districts, 100 county \ncities (small cities), about 1,400 townships, 17,000 administrative villages, and 177,000 villages. \nLocated south of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Jiangxi still largely depends on its \nrural economy and agriculture. The province has many mountainous and hilly areas (36% of the \nland  area)  and  surface  water  bodies  (22%  of  the  province  surface  area),  limiting  urban \ndevelopment potential. The Gan River and Poyang Lake are significant watershed systems that \n                                                \n1  The  TA  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  as  Research  on  the  County\u2013Town\u2013Village \nInteractive Development of Jiangxi Province.

Beijing. \n ", "2   \nserve as resources for ecosystem services and contribute to Jiangxi\u2019s economy. Jiangxi\u2019s New-\ntype Urbanization Plan (2014\u20132020) aims to (i) increase the urbanization ratio from 47.5% in \n2012 to 60.0% by 2020 for the urban resident population and from 27.0% in 2012 to 40.0% by \n2020 for the registered household population, and (ii) remove the dual hukou system. The plan \nincludes  (i) the  development  of  a  core  urban  cluster  around  Poyang  Lake,  anchored  in \nNanchang and two urban corridors; (ii) the general development of small and medium-sized \ncities; and (iii) rural upgrading. The last two of these will be supported by the TA. \n \n4.  The development progress of small cities, towns, and villages is relatively slow, and \npolicy planning and actions are urgently needed. The Jiangxi provincial government intends to \nstudy,  plan,  and  develop  policies  to  demonstrate  successful  approaches  to  (i)  improve \ncoordinated planning and systematic medium- and long-term investment programming, and \nintegration of housing, economic, and industrial development in small cities, towns, and villages; \n(ii) enhance economic development; create jobs; promote farm upscaling; improve produce \nquality (i.e., green food); integrate value chains, food processing, and light industry; and develop \nthe service sector in small cities, towns, and villages; (iii) upgrade infrastructure, public services, \nand links between and among small cities, towns, and villages; (iv) reform the dual hukou \nsystem  and  rural  land  policy  to  enable  farm  upscaling  and  land  market  development; \n(v) improve ecosystem planning and management through environmental protection, reduction \nof pollution from chemical fertilizers and pesticides, water source protection and water safety, \nand  wastewater  and  solid-waste  management;  (vi)  promote  self-administration  through \nenhanced management systems within local communities and governments; (vii) coordinate \nequal public service delivery for health, education, technical and vocational training, social \nsecurity, poverty alleviation, and cultural facilities and institutions; and (viii) improve the public \nfinance mechanism and raise funds for infrastructure, and promote enabling environments for \nprivate investments and small and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n5.  The TA is aligned with the strategic priorities of the ADB Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020  and  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC  of  achieving  socially \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable growth.5 By supporting the PRC\u2019s efforts to promote \nbetter integration of urban and rural development, this TA is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Urban \nOperational Plan, 2012\u20132020.6 Further, it is in line with the key policies of the government's 12th \nFive-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 and strategically supports key initiatives planned in the PRC\u2019s \nNational New-type Urbanization Plan.7 During the TA preparation, government counterparts \ndiscussed the TA objectives with the Jiangxi Provincial Development and Reform Commission \nand some of the initial key concepts of the TA will be included in the provincial 13th five-year \nplan, which will be further refined during the implementation of both the TA and the plan. Both \nthe 13th five-year plan and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for 2016\u20132020 are anticipated to \ninclude inclusive and green urban\u2013rural development as priorities, which the TA will support. \n \n6.  The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Jiangxi Provincial \n13th plenary session have identified that urban\u2013rural integration is fundamental to resolve the \nkey challenges of rural development. The sessions made arrangements for implementing rural \nreforms;  streamlining  urban\u2013rural  bureaucratic  systems;  improving  urban\u2013rural  institutional \ndevelopment; and promoting coordinated development of large-, medium-sized, and small cities, \ntowns, and villages as a new type of integrated urban\u2013rural development. \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2014.

The TA will build on and further develop concepts and findings on inclusive and green \nurban\u2013rural development from previous and ongoing ADB loans and TA projects in Jiangxi \nprovince, the PRC, and Asia and the Pacific.8 The TA will also use lessons learned from case \nstudies presented in two 2014 workshops carried out with ADB support in the PRC.9 \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n8.  The expected TA impacts will be (i) socially inclusive development in small cities, towns, \nand villages in Jiangxi province increased; and (ii) environmental sustainability of development \nin small cities, towns, and villages in Jiangxi province improved. The expected outcome of the \nTA will be urban\u2013rural development policy and planning toward greater social inclusion and \nenvironmental sustainability in Jiangxi province improved by 2018. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA is expected to have three outputs: (i) a development framework and investment \nprogram  featuring  inclusive  and  green  economic  development  for  small  cities,  towns,  and \nvillages  in  Jiangxi  province  developed;  (ii)  policy  recommendations  and  a  framework  for \ninstitutional support structure enabling inclusive and green development of small cities, towns, \nand villages in Jiangxi province prepared; and (iii) capacity for inclusive, green, sustainable, and \ncoordinated development of small cities, towns, and villages in Jiangxi province improved. \n \n10.  The TA will support (i) the preparation of a province-wide inclusive and green economic \ndevelopment strategy with short-, medium-, and long-term investment programs for small cities, \ntowns, and villages that will include assessments and planning for (a) basic public and social \ninfrastructure, such as roads and public transport, transport safety, education, health and elderly \ncare,  and  convenient  public  service  stations  such  as  one-stop  shop  for  registration  and \napprovals; (b) environmental infrastructure and ecosystem services, such as water supply, \nwastewater  management,  solid-waste  management,  river  rehabilitation  and  flood  risk \nmanagement,  reforestation,  and  urban\u2013rural  partnership  mechanisms,  including  eco-\ncompensation;  and  (c)  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  development,  including \nurban\u2013rural supply chain integration, local value addition including farm upscaling and product \nprocessing, green food production, light industry and service sector development, and rural \nfinance;  (ii)  preparation  of  a  policy  framework  that  will  facilitate  implementation  of  the \ndevelopment strategy in all aspects of strategy and investment program;  and (iii) capacity \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2015.

The potential risk of lack of \ncoordination  across  departments  will  be  mitigated  through  consultations  with  concerned \nprovincial and local agencies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of funding for training and study tours; as well as staff \ntime, suitable office space for the consultants, data and information collection, logistical support, \nand other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  15  December  2015  to  31  December  2017.  The \nexecuting agency will be the Jiangxi Provincial Finance Department. The implementing agency \nwill be the Jiangxi Rural Works Department (JRWD). A project management office has been \nestablished under the JRWD with participation from the Jiangxi Provincial Finance Department. \nCounties, small cities, towns, and villages will participate through consultation. The TA will build \non arrangements made and expand activities carried out by the JRWD since 2013. These \nincluded  conferences  on  small  city,  town,  and  village  interactive  development  and  initial \nresearch into and planning for reform of Jiangxi\u2019s agriculture and rural system. \n \n14.  It  is  estimated  that  the  TA  will  require  27  person-months  of  consulting  services, \ncomprising  9  person-months  of  international  and  18  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  through  a  firm  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 using simplified technical \nproposal  procedures.
