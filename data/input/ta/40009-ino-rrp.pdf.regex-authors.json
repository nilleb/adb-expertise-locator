The Asian financial crisis of 1997 led to a steep decline \nin  overall  development  spending,  and  particularly  infrastructure \ninvestments.  Since  1998,  private  sector  investment  has  almost \ndisappeared. At the same time, the Government realized that the public \nsector  had  borne  a  disproportionate  share  of  the  risks  in  the \ninfrastructure sectors, and stopped providing any risk-sharing support. \nAs a result, Indonesia has lost its place as one of the top performers in \nterms of infrastructure provision in the Southeast Asian region. With \ninfrastructure investments currently at around 2% of GDP, about 50 \nmillion people (or more than 20% of the population) do not have access \nto treated water, 90 million are without electricity, and about 200 million \nwithout fixed telephone lines or connections to a sewerage network. \nThe  poor  suffer  disproportionately  from  lack  of  access  to  basic \ninfrastructure services. Availability of services is generally lower in rural \nareas,  particularly  outside  Java  and  Bali,  contributing  to  significant \nregional disparities in development. \n \nThe Government estimates that about $65 billion will be needed in new \ninfrastructure investments over the next 5 years, with $25 billion (38%) \nto be met from the government budget; $14 billion (22%) by domestic \nbanks,  and  insurance  and  pension  funds;  $10  billion  (15%)  by \nmultilateral and bilateral development partners; and $16 billion (25%) by \ndomestic and foreign private sector investors. \n ", "ii \nGiven the weak investment climate, the Government recognizes that \nPSP  cannot  be  taken  for  granted,  and  serious  structural  and \ninstitutional  reforms  are  needed.  At  the  January  2005  Indonesia \nInfrastructure Summit, the Government announced its commitment to \npromote PSP and identified 91 potential infrastructure projects. It has \nsince introduced several critical measures to strengthen the regulatory \nand institutional framework for PSP. The February 2006 comprehensive \nInfrastructure Policy Package outlines the short-term reform agenda in \nvarious  infrastructure  sectors.  The  IRSDP,  formulated  at  the \nGovernment\u2019s  request  in  consultation  with  all  stakeholders  and \ndevelopment partners, is based on this agenda and extends it over the \nmedium term.        \n   \n  Impact and  The  IRSDP  will  improve  the  investment  climate  and  support  timely \n  Outcome  realization of the Government\u2019s medium-term macroeconomic goals, in \nparticular  achieving  average  annual  GDP  growth  of  6%\u20137%  during \n2005\u20132009,  through  enhanced  provision  of,  and  access  to, \ninfrastructure.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  IRSDP  is  accelerated \ninfrastructure development through large-scale PSP and mobilization of \nadditional public sector resources. \n   \nThe Program Loan   \n    Impact and  The program loans for the IRSDP support three key reform pillars: \n    Outcome   \n(i)  Strategic cross-sectoral reforms resulting in \n(a)  improved  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  frameworks  for \ngreater PSP anchored on good governance principles; \n(b)  a well-structured risk management framework to promote \nPSP; \n(c)  accelerated  mobilization  of  domestic  long-term  financial \nresources for infrastructure development through public-\nprivate partnership (PPP) projects; and  \n(d)  a  streamlined  regional  autonomy  framework  delineating \nfunctional  responsibilities  for  infrastructure  provision  by \nnational and local governments. \n \n(ii)  Sector-specific reforms for transportation, power, oil and gas, \nwater supply and sanitation, and telecommunications leading to \n(a)  improved  financial  soundness  and  sustainability  of \ninfrastructure services through full cost recovery; \n(b)  greater competition that benefits consumers by improving \nservices and lowering tariffs; \n(c)  independent  regulatory  structures  that  are  distinct  from \ncontracting and operating functions;   \n(d)  equal  access  for  all  participants/investors,  and  the \nprevention of abuse of natural monopoly rights; and \n(e)  fulfillment  of  public  service  obligations  of  infrastructure \nservice providers, in line with the Government\u2019s poverty \nreduction objective.  \n \n(iii)   Facilitation of the preparation and execution of well-structured \nmodel PPP projects that can be replicated. \n ", "iii \n  Program  For subprogram 1, the Government has requested ADB to provide a \n  Investment Plan  loan of $400 million. The Government envisages support from ADB of \n  around $300 million\u2013$400 million for each of subprograms 2 and 3, \nwhich will be reconfirmed during IRSDP review and processing. The \nGovernment has requested the Government of Japan and the World \nBank  to  cofinance  the  IRSDP;  this  is  being  considered  by  the \ndevelopment partners. \n   \n  Financing Plan  A  loan  of  $400  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  for \nsubprogram 1 will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment \ncharge of 0.75% per annum; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft program loan agreement.  \n   \n  Program Period  Subprogram  1  was  implemented  from  January  2005  to  September \n  and Tranching  2006, and all actions included in the policy matrix under subprogram 1 \nare complete. Subprogram 2 will be implemented from October 2006 to \nJune 2008, and subprogram 3 from July 2008 to March 2010. All three \nprogram loans will be disbursed in single tranches upon declaration of \ntheir effectiveness. \n   \n  Executing  The National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), under the \n  Agency  overall coordination of the National Committee on the Acceleration of \nInfrastructure  Development  (KKPPI)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency. \nBAPPENAS will closely collaborate with the Coordinating Ministry of \nEconomic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and the concerned line ministries \nin executing the IRSDP. The line ministries and agencies will implement \nthe reform actions.  \n   \n  Procurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans.  \n \nThe Project Loan  \n  Impact and  The project loan is to help accelerate PSP in Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure \n  Outcome  sectors. Establishment of the PDF will alleviate one of the most critical \nconstraints impeding infrastructure development, namely, the lack of \nadequate project preparation. The PDF will help the Government (i) \nprepare feasibility studies for national and decentralized PPP projects; \n(ii) adopt open and transparent bidding processes; and (iii) execute \nproject  transactions.  Resources  will  be  allocated  through  a  national \ncomponent  of  the  PDF  focusing  on  large  national  projects,  and  a \nregional  component  of  the  PDF  supporting  smaller  decentralized \nprojects of local governments.  \n ", "iv \n  Financing Plan  A loan of $26.5 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwill be provided. The loan will have a 32-year fixed term including a \ngrace period of 8 years, a 1% interest charge during the grace period, \nand 1.5% thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are set \nforth  in  the  draft  Project  Loan  Agreement.  The  loan  will  be \nsupplemented  by  a  $7.6  million  grant  from  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands to be administered by ADB. Disbursement procedures will \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n   \n  Executing  BAPPENAS will be Executing Agency for the Project. The head of the \n  Agency and  Directorate for PPPs in BAPPENAS will be the overall project director \n  Implementation  for the PDF on behalf of the Government. A project management unit \n  Arrangements  will be established to administer the PDF. For the local government \nprojects, a steering committee chaired by the BAPPENAS deputy for \ninfrastructure  affairs  and  including  senior  representatives  of  the \nCoordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry \nof  Home  Affairs,  and  the  concerned  line  ministries,  plus  a \nrepresentative  of  the  associations  of  regional  governments  (on  a \nrotational basis), will be created. The Project will be implemented over 5 \nyears. \n   \n  Consulting  About 552 person-months of international consulting inputs and 3,401 \n  Services and  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  required.  The \n   Procurement  consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurements Guidelines. \n   \nTechnical  The  Government  has  asked  ADB  for  TA  support  for  (i)  effectively \nAssistance  implementing  the  risk  management  framework  adopted  under  the \nIRSDP;  (ii)  establishing  various  infrastructure  funds,  with  focus  on \nensuring  their  fiduciary  governance;  (iii)  developing  an  effective \ncommunication  strategy  and  social  marketing  to  disseminate \ninformation and build support for reforms; and (iv) ensuring the quality \nof projects at entry to the PDF. The total cost of the TA is estimated at \n$2,500,000, of which $2,000,000 will be provided as a grant from the \nADB-funded TA funding program. \n   \nProgram Benefits  The IRSDP\u2019s expected benefits include \nand Beneficiaries  (i)  sustained  progress  in  meeting  the  Government\u2019s \nmacroeconomic  objectives  articulated  in  its  Medium-\nTerm Development Plan for 2006\u20132009; \n(ii)  improved investment climate resulting from sound policy, \nlegal, and institutional frameworks in the infrastructure \nsectors; \n(iii)  greater  PSP  and  a  more  systematic  approach  for \nimplementing  PPP  transactions  focusing  on  good \ngovernance; \n(iv)  a transparent and prudent risk-sharing system; \n(v)  quality  infrastructure  projects  prepared  and  executed \ntransparently and expeditiously, resulting in (a) improved \navailability and quality of infrastructure services, (b) a \nboost to Indonesia\u2019s competitiveness versus its regional \n ", "v \nneighbors, and (c) lower poverty incidence; \n(vi)  sustained engagement by ADB in policy reforms over the \nmedium term to strengthen the investment climate; and \n(vii)  aid harmonization by the primary development partners \n(ADB, World Bank, and Government of Japan) around a \ncommon policy framework, and the positive externalities \nresulting  from  joint  endorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s \nreform agenda. \n   \nRisks and  Lack  of  Coordination  and  Conflict  of  Interest.  Progress  in \nAssumptions  infrastructure  reforms  in  the  past  was  impeded  by  the  lack  of \ncoordination  among  line  ministries  and  competing  and  conflicting \ninterests of various stakeholders. In particular, bureaucratic as well as \npolitical economy factors prevented restructuring of key infrastructure \ninstitutions and sector liberalization. Vested interests may still continue \nto oppose transparent bidding processes and favor politically connected \nentities. Such interests may exert pressure on the Government to share \nrisks in an imprudent manner, or circumvent the legal and regulatory \nframework to prevent large-scale PSP. Recognizing past deficiencies, \nthe  Government  has  adopted  a  sound  legal,  regulatory,  and  risk \nmanagement framework and coordination mechanism to promote PSP, \nand is committed to introducing competition and reducing the costs of \ninfrastructure  provision.  The  IRSDP  will  help  reduce  the  risks  and \npromote PPPs by (i) leveraging reforms that improve the investment \nclimate  to  meet  the  medium-term  growth  objectives,  including  the \nadoption of institutional mechanisms to coordinate PPP projects at the \noversight and line ministry levels; (ii) supporting the determination of \nrisk sharing in a prudent and transparent manner; and (iii) bringing as \nmany high-value projects as possible for open and transparent bidding \nand execution.   \n  \nPoor Governance and Corruption. With the high stakes involved in \nlarge infrastructure projects, the IRSDP faces significant risks in the \nform of weak governance, collusion, and corruption. Such problems \nhave been common in the past in Indonesia. However, during the last \nyear the Government has considerably strengthened its anticorruption \nefforts.  Procurement  reforms  have  been  under  way  for  some  time, \nresulting in competitive and relatively transparent selection of bidders by \nthe public sector. The PSP regulatory framework, adopted as part of the \nIRSDP,  sets  out  clear  guidelines  for  the  selection  of  private  sector \nsponsors. The National Committee on the Acceleration of Infrastructure \nDevelopment is tasked with ensuring that bidding processes are fair and \ntransparent. The President has enhanced the profile and activities of the \nAnti-Corruption  Commission  and  other  law  enforcement  agencies \nconsiderably. These steps are already having an impact.       \n \nSocial Tensions. Tariff reforms are sensitive in any environment, and \nIndonesia is no exception. As the country gradually moves away from \nthe current system of administered tariffs for infrastructure services, \nsocial  tensions  will  be  inevitable.  However,  the  savings  from  the \nreduction in inefficient subsidies will enable the Government to reorient \nits public expenditures to poverty reduction, employment generation, \n ", "vi \nand rural infrastructure development. \n \nAdverse  Domestic  and  Regional  Economic  Developments.  PSP \ncould  be  impeded  by  domestic  macroeconomic  volatility,  lack  of \nsustained momentum on policy reforms, or adverse regional events that \nhave a contagion effect on the Indonesian economy. Over the last few \nyears, the Indonesian economy has been quite resilient to domestic and \nexternal shocks. The Government has begun adopting wide-ranging \nreforms to address investors\u2019 concerns.  \n \nHeightened Security Alerts Stemming from Sectarian and Regional \nConflicts,  and  Security  Concerns.  The  Government  and  its  law \nenforcement  authorities  have  taken  a  range  of  effective  measures \nagainst such conflicts that could slow private investment, and to rebuild \npublic and investor confidence.  \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster for the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (IRSDP) in the \nRepublic of Indonesia comprising three subprograms; (ii) a proposed loan to the Republic of \nIndonesia for subprogram 1 of the IRSDP; (iii) a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for \nthe establishment and operation of an Infrastructure Project Development Facility (PDF); (iv) \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Enhancing  Private  Sector  Participation  (PSP)  in \nInfrastructure  Provision;  and  (v)  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of Netherlands for the PDF. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n2.  Until the 1997 financial crisis, Indonesia successfully used infrastructure development to \naddress poverty reduction and economic development. However, infrastructure investments, \nwhich accounted for more than 6% of annual gross domestic product (GDP) before 1997, have \nfallen to 2% in recent years, reflecting a sharp decline in public and private spending. The \nfinancial crisis greatly aggravated the situation; many planned public and private infrastructure \nprojects  were  canceled  or  suspended.  Since  1997,  only  some  basic  preservation  and \nmaintenance of infrastructure, with very little expansion, have taken place.  \n \n3.  Current infrastructure service coverage in Indonesia is low by regional standards. In \n1996, Indonesia outperformed the People\u2019s Republic of China, Sri Lanka, and Thailand in terms \nof overall infrastructure quality. However, by 2004 these countries had overtaken Indonesia, \nwhich ranked 64th of the 80 countries surveyed.1 About 50 million people lack access to treated \nwater,  90  million  to  electricity,  and  close  to  200  million  do  not  have  direct  access  to \ntelecommunications  or  connections  to  a  sewerage  network  (Box  1).  The  poor  suffer \ndisproportionately from lack of access. Moreover, the generally lower availability in rural areas, \nparticularly outside Java and Bali, contributes to significant regional disparities in development. \n \n4.  While the financial crisis impeded development and growth in all of Southeast Asia, it is \nnot the sole reason for the poor state of infrastructure sectors in Indonesia. Supported by the \neconomic boom prior to the crisis, investment decisions under the New Order regime were \nmade on the basis of political connections, rather than a clear and impartial judgment of the \nassociated risks, benefits, and costs. As a result, the public sector absorbed a disproportionate \nshare of the risks. In addition, no concerted effort was made to address the various policy, legal, \nand institutional impediments facing the infrastructure sectors. Subsequent governments during \n1998\u20132004 were burdened with the more urgent tasks of financial sector restructuring and fiscal \nconsolidation.  Efforts  were  directed  to  mitigate  risks  by  renegotiating  major  infrastructure \ncontracts signed before the crisis. Initial steps were also taken to put in place an interministerial \nmechanism to coordinate infrastructure development. \n \n5.  Following  Indonesia\u2019s first  direct presidential  elections  in  October  2004,  the  current \nGovernment set ambitious macroeconomic targets for the Medium-Term Development Plan \n(RPJM: 2005\u20132009) to be achieved by 2009: (i) accelerate GDP growth from 4.5% in 2004 to \n7.6% (with an annual average of 6.6%), (ii) increase the investment/GDP ratio from 20.5% in \n                                                 \n1  World Economic Forum. 2004. Global Competitiveness Report 2004\u20132005. Geneva. In 2006, this ranking changed \nto 89th out of the 125 countries surveyed in terms of basic infrastructure provision, in relation to Thailand (38), \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (60) and Sri Lanka (76). World Economic Forum. 2006. Global Competitiveness Report \n2006\u20132007. Geneva.  ", "2   \n2003 to 28.4%, (iii) reduce the unemployment rate from 9.7% in 2004 to 5.1%, and (iv) halve the \npoverty rate from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2%. The Government recognizes that major infrastructure \nexpansion is required to remove existing bottlenecks, increase service coverage, and attract \nprivate sector investment to help achieve and sustain the projected economic growth.  \n \nBox 1: Provision of Infrastructure in Indonesia \n  \nIndonesia,  which  outperformed  its  regional  neighbors  in  infrastructure  provision  until  the  Asian \nfinancial crisis, now lags far behind. Annual public and private infrastructure investments as a share of \nthe gross domestic product declined to 1% in 2000 from more than 6% in the early 1990s, before \nrecovering to around 2% in 2005. Foreign investments in productive sectors also declined. The gaps in \ninfrastructure provision and access are significant: \n \n\u2022  Roads. Indonesia has the lowest road density in the region of 0.19 kilometer (km) per square \nkm or 1.7 km per 1,000 people. \n\u2022  Power.  The  State  Electricity  Corporation  connected  on  average  about  1  million  new \ncustomers per annum during 1974\u20132004. With more than 90 million people still lacking access \nto electricity, Indonesia will be unable to meet its 90% electrification target for 2020 unless \ninvestments are restored and the connection program is accelerated.  \n\u2022  Water supply and sanitation. Only about 40 million people or 18% of the population are \nconnected to a piped water supply; even in urban areas only 33% have access to piped water. \nIndonesia has one of the lowest rates of urban sewerage coverage in Asia. As a result, the \nincidence of waterborne diseases is high, and diarrhea is the second largest cause of death \namong young children. Indonesia is unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goal target \nnumber 10. \n\u2022  Telecommunications. Access is among the lowest in the region, with only about 4 fixed lines \nper 100 people, compared to 18\u201320 fixed lines elsewhere. \n \nSource: ADB staff \n \n6.  In early 2005, the Government estimated that about $145 billion would be needed for \ninfrastructure expansion during 2005\u20132009. Since then, based on updated assessments and \nmore realistic forecasts of potential investment flows, it has revised the estimate down to about \n$65 billion, with $25 billion (38%) to be met from the Government budget, $14 billion (22%) by \ndomestic banks and insurance and pension funds, $10 billion (15%) by multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment partners, and $16 billion (25%) by domestic and foreign private sector investors. \nWith investments at this level, infrastructure investments would again reach about 5-6% of GDP, \nconsidered to be the minimum required to restore precrisis levels of infrastructure provision and \nsupport RPJM targets. \n \n7.  The  Government  recognizes  that PSP  cannot  be  taken  for  granted,  unless  serious \nstructural and institutional reforms are implemented. Broad-ranging policy reforms are critical to \nimprove the investment climate, including (i) liberalizing markets to allow competition and entry \nby  new  service  providers,  (ii)  improving  legal  and  regulatory  certainty  and  strengthening \nregulatory arrangements, (iii) introducing tariff regimes based on full cost recovery or providing \ncompensation  to  meet  public  service  obligations  (PSOs),  and  (iv)  establishing  effective \nmechanisms for dispute resolution. In January 2005, the Indonesia Infrastructure Summit (IIS) \nprovided  a  platform  for  the  Government  to  articulate  its  commitment  to  reform.2  This \ncommitment, together with a list of short-term actions, is recorded in the Declaration of Action \non Developing Infrastructure and Public Private Partnerships approved at the IIS.  \n                                                 \n2  More than 700 delegates attended the IIS representing the public and private sector, development partners, civil \nsociety,  and  media.  The  Government  was  represented  by  the  President,  vice  president,  and  all  ministers \nconcerned with infrastructure. \n ", "3 \n8.  In January 2005, at the Consultative Group on Indonesia meeting, following the IIS, the \nGovernment asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support infrastructure reforms over \nthe medium term, and thereby help implement the RPJM. ADB has been engaged in policy \ndialogue with the Government and other principal development partners since early 2005. For \nthe IIS, ADB, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and the World Bank jointly \nprepared six policy briefs on issues and constraints facing the main infrastructure sectors, and \non recommendations for reform. Subsequently, in May 2005 the Government of Indonesia and \nthe Government of Japan jointly adopted the Strategic Investment Action Plan to improve the \ninvestment climate. The plan includes many infrastructure-related actions. Building on these, the \nGovernment has taken a range of initial critical steps to set the pace for reform. In February \n2006, the Government released the Infrastructure Policy Package, based on work by the line \nministries, oversight agencies, ADB, Government of Japan, and World Bank. The package \ndescribes 50 actions completed in 2005, and 153 actions to be implemented during 2006. \n \n9.  The IRSDP, using the Infrastructure Policy Package as its anchor, extends the 2005\u2013\n2006 actions until 2009. The Government will announce this medium-term reform agenda to \ninvestors at the second IIS, scheduled for November 2006. Given the centrality of infrastructure \nreforms for the RPJM, the Indonesia Government has asked the Government of Japan and the \nWorld Bank to cofinance the IRSDP, which they are currently considering. \n \n10.  As part of the discussions on ADB\u2019s new country strategy and program for Indonesia for \n2006\u20132009, the Government asked ADB to work toward a credible medium-term commitment of \nresources to support one of the proposed main areas of engagement, namely, infrastructure \nand infrastructure services. The IRSDP structure as a program cluster is intended to provide an \noverall  umbrella  for  that  kind  of  commitment.  Subject  to  satisfactory  progress,  the  three \nsubprograms will be phased at intervals of about 21 months.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Issues \n11.  Broad-based economic liberalization and restructuring, followed by fiscal consolidation, \nhave enabled Indonesia to resume steady economic growth. After the post-crisis contraction of \nnegative 13.1% in 1998 and 0.8% in 1999, real GDP growth rose to 5.6% in 2005. During the \nsame period, the overall budget deficit declined from around 4% of GDP to 0.5%, and the \noutstanding debt stock fell from around 100% of GDP to 45%. In March and October 2005, the \nGovernment increased domestic oil prices by 49% and 126%. In previous years, Indonesia\u2019s \nnational  budgets  allocated  $4  billion\u2013$7  billion  per  annum  for  inefficient,  untargeted  fuel \nsubsidies to cushion domestic consumers from the higher global oil prices. The sharp reduction \nof the fuel subsidies, which became unsustainable at the $60\u2013$70 per barrel world market \nprices, created additional fiscal space, facilitating a reorientation of public spending to meet \nessential education, health, and infrastructure needs.  \n \n12.  The  primary  infrastructure  issues  and  constraints  are  discussed  in  Appendix  2.  All \nsectors lag Indonesia\u2019s neighbors in terms of service coverage and their investment needs are \nmuch higher than the public sector can mobilize on its own (Appendix 2, Figure A2). This \nunderlines the need for prioritization, with public sector resources used for basic infrastructure \nsuch as rural roads, rural electrification, and water supply and sanitation in rural and low-income \nurban areas, i.e., interventions of a noncommercial nature that have a strong impact on poverty \nreduction. Financing from multilateral and bilateral development partners should be used for this \npurpose as well. The development partners will also play an important role in helping the \nGovernment create a conducive environment for large-scale PSP that is crucial for meeting the \nmassive  investment  requirements,  and  attract  private  sector  investment  to  public-private \n   ", "4   \npartnerships  (PPPs)3  for  commercially  viable  infrastructure  projects.  The  IRSDP  will  help \nIndonesia realize the potential for PSP and leverage public sector resources to reduce service \ncoverage gaps. \n \na.  Legal and Regulatory Impediments \n13.  Cross-Sectoral Framework for PSP. PSP in infrastructure sectors reached about $1.5 \nbillion in 1994, well below the public sector investment in infrastructure of about $8.0 billion. \nBoth peaked in 1996, with PSP accounting for $6.5 billion of the total investment of $16.0 billion. \nThis  was  followed  by  a  sharp  downturn  after  1997.  To  revive  private  investments  in \ninfrastructure, an effective legal framework is critical. The presidential decree, issued after the \nonset of the Asian financial crisis, did not meet this purpose.4 Although it defined PSP and \ncalled for the selection of private sector sponsors through open and transparent bidding, the \ndecree adopted a simplistic approach and left many critical questions on the PPP scope, \nimplementation, performance norms, tariffs, and dispute resolution unanswered. In the absence \nof an overall infrastructure law, a revision of this decree is considered to be the best way to \nprovide an adequate legal framework.  \n \n14.  Sector-Specific  Legal  and  Regulatory  Framework.  The  legal  and  regulatory \nframework is complex in Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure sectors. The division of responsibilities for \nthe  five  principal  functions\u2014policy  making,  sector  planning,  regulation,  contracting,  and \noperation\u2014currently differs from sector to sector (Table 1). While the line ministries in charge of \ninfrastructure5 are uniformly responsible for policy making and sector planning, they sometimes \nalso have regulatory responsibilities. In other cases, they have partly or fully delegated this \nresponsibility to recently established regulatory bodies that still report to the minister and are \nfunded from the line ministry budget. In some cases, the regulatory bodies also have contracting \nfunctions. In other cases, the contracting function is undertaken by state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs) that are the main operators in the sector. Two issues need to be addressed: (i) the \nappropriate role of the state and SOEs in the policy making, planning, regulatory, contracting, \nand operator functions; and (ii) the need for equal opportunities for private sector operations. \n \n15.  SOEs  have  a  pervasive  role  across  all  the  sectors  and  dominate  sea  and  air \ntransportation, railways, and electricity. Private enterprises have to compete with these SOEs, \nwhich tend to be better established. Telecommunications is an exception, and the Government \nis committed to enhancing competition by moving away from the current duopoly in the market. \nFour of the nine sectors have established nominally independent regulatory authorities, though \nthey report to the concerned line ministries and some perform contracting functions. In essence, \nthe plethora of agencies involved and their complex interrelationships in sector functions have \n                                                 \n3  PPPs are contractual arrangements between the public sector and a private sector party for the private delivery of \npublic  infrastructure  services.  They  range  from  service  contracts  to  management  contracts  to  leases  to \nconcessions, such as build-own-operate-transfer contracts, to divestiture and build-own-operate contracts, and \nfrequently involve complementary investments and/or services. Examples include private investments in power \ngeneration that are complemented by public investments in power transmission and distribution; involvement of a \nstrategic private investor in the implementation and operation of a gas transmission project undertaken by the state \ngas corporation; implementation of a network of feeder roads or provision of land by the public sector to \nsupplement a privately financed and operated toll road; provision of airside facilities (such as runways and aprons) \nby the public sector with private investors providing landside facilities (such as terminals and their operation); and \nprovision of port infrastructure by the public sector with a private investor being awarded a concession for port \noperation. \n4  Presidential Decree 7/1998 on Cooperation between the Government and Private Companies in the Development \nand/or Management of Infrastructure.  \n5  The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources for oil, gas, and power; Ministry of Public Works for roads, water \nsupply, and sanitation; Ministry of Transportation for ports, airports, and railways; and Ministry of Communications \nand Informatics for telecommunications. \n ", "5 \nstymied reforms and made coordination difficult. A thorough review of the regulatory framework \nis essential, followed by changes over the medium term to enhance efficiency.  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Sector Regulatory Frameworks \n \n  Policy Making       \nSector  and Planning  Regulator  Contracting  Operator \nLand Transport  MOT   MOT  MOT and local  Local governments, SOE, and \ngovernments  the private sector \nToll Roads  MPW  BPJT (not fully  BPJT  Government, SOE, and the \nindependent)  private sector \nRailways  MOT   MOT  PT KAI  SOE monopoly (contracting \nonly through the SOE) \nPorts and Airports  MOT   MOT  MOT, local  MOT, local governments, and \ngovernments, and  SOE monopoly (contracting \nSOE  only through the SOE) \nPower  MEMR  MEMR  PT PLN  SOE monopoly, but with IPPs  \nOil and Gas  MEMR  MEMR  BP Migas  SOE and the private sector \n(upstream)  (open competition) \nOil and Gas  MEMR  MEMR and  BPH Migas  SOE and the private sector \n(downstream)  BPH Migas  (open competition) \nTelecommunications  MOC  BRTI (not fully    SOE and the private sector \nindependent)  (open competition) \nWater Supply and  MPW  BPP-SPAM  Local Governments  SOE and the private sector \nSanitation  (not fully  (open competition) \nindependent) \nBPJT = Indonesian Toll Road Authority; BP Migas and BPH Migas = gas contracting and regulatory bodies; BPP-\nSPAM = National Water Regulatory Agency; BRTI = Indonesian Telecommunications Regulatory Body; IPP = \nindependent power producer; MCI = Ministry of Communications and Informatics; MEMR = Ministry of Energy and \nMineral Resources; MOT = Ministry of Transport; MPW = Ministry of Public Works; PT KAI = Indonesian Railway \nCorporation; and PT PLN = State Electricity Corporation. \nNote: Ports do not include shipping, and airports do not include civil aviation. In both cases, the private sector can \nparticipate, e.g., in operating shipping lines and airlines. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff.  \n \nb.  Resource Constraints Impeding Public and Private Investments \n16.  Lack of Focus on and Resources for Project Preparation. An important prerequisite \nfor PSP is adequacy and consistency of information needed for investment decisions. This has \nbeen  constrained  by  (i)  lack  of  resources  for  sector  planning;  and  (ii)  line  ministries  and \ncontracting agencies not focusing on, or providing adequate resources for, project preparation \nbecause of fiscal constraints. Prior to the crisis, Indonesia had a well-established system for \npreparing  annual  and  medium-term  sector  plans  that  identified  targets  for  infrastructure \nprovision and developed investment plans for achieving the targets. However, due to lack of \nresources  for  plan  preparation\u2014and,  more  importantly,  for  actual  public  investment  in \ninfrastructure\u2014planning  capacity  in  some  sectors  was  eroded.  Sector  development  plans \ndescribing long-term physical expansion and sector blueprints outlining long-term vision in terms \nof  restructuring  and  competition  should  be  prepared  or,  if  already  available,  updated.  To \naccomplish this, the planning functions and capacity of line ministries need to be strengthened, \nin accordance with the gradual shift in the role of the Government from service provider to policy \nmaker, planner, coordinator, and facilitator. Strong central coordination is essential to ensure a \nconsistent approach to PSP across infrastructure sectors and efficient use of available funds by \nthe line ministries. \n \n17.  Lack of capacity and resources and the absence of a systematic process have also led \nto lack of attention to project preparation. While the budget system does allow line ministries \nand agencies to obtain some resources for preparing feasibility studies, the widespread view is \n   ", "6   \nthat for PPP projects, this work should be done by the private sector sponsors. Once projects \nare identified and some preparation done, the critical steps of procurement and transaction \nexecution also generally suffer from resource constraints.  \n \n18.  Lack  of  a  Sound  Risk  Management  Framework.  In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s, \nunsolicited  project  proposals  from  politically connected  private  sector  parties  created  large \npublic sector liabilities that were highlighted by the Asian financial crisis, particularly in the \npower  sector.  Now  the  Government  is  very  cautious  in  offering  support  to  private  sector \ninvestors.6 At the same time, the Government is aware of the importance of adequate risk \nmitigation and sharing to attract large-scale PSP. A sound investment climate, supported by \nreduced investor perception of corruption, would be the best risk mitigation mechanism. This \nwould entail continuous and sustained policy reforms that lead to a stable macroeconomic \nenvironment, well-functioning judicial system, independent and technically sound regulation, full \ncost recovery in infrastructure services (or a well-targeted output-based subsidy where the full \ncost recovery would make such services unaffordable), and open access in the infrastructure \nsectors. During the transition before these ideal conditions are achieved and confidence fully \nrestored, private investors will ask for government support to help mitigate risks that are not \nunder their control. The principal lesson is that the previous practice of blanket guarantees \nshould not be repeated. The various risks in each sector and for each project type need to be \nidentified, and then allocated to the party that can best control them. No universal solution is \napplicable to all situations, and the range of possible solutions is wide, depending on the \nspecific circumstances of each case. The provision of adequate resources to SOEs to fulfill their \nPSOs may be one natural way of mitigating the potential default risk of those entities. The other \nimportant lesson is that risk allocation should not be rigid. Risks should gradually be transferred \nfrom the public sector to private investors as conditions improve, until market instruments rather \nthan government guarantees can be used for risk hedging. \n \n19.  Lack of Adequate Cost Recovery. Given the multiplicity of agencies involved and with \nSOEs playing a key role in many sectors, tariffs are usually administered for infrastructure \nservices. Most notably for power, oil and gas, air transport, and water supply, national or local \nparliamentary approval or presidential regulations with parliamentary consensus are needed for \ntariff increases. Indonesia has done quite well in the power, and oil and gas sectors. However \nprices are still not on par with international prices for oil and gas and do not reflect actual costs \nfor electricity as they are not subject to automatic adjustments. The average electricity tariff was \nincreased by 29% in 2000, 17% during July-October 2001, and through quarterly adjustments of \n6%  each  during  2002\u20132003.  These  increases  brought  the  average  tariff  from  about \n$0.025/kilowatt-hour (kWh) after the Asian financial crisis to $0.068/kWh in late 2003, a major \naccomplishment and proof of the successful socialization by the Government in this highly \nsensitive area. Since then, the average tariff has decreased to $0.062/kWh due to rupiah \ndepreciation and changes in the consumption structure. The Government increased fuel oil \nprices by 29% and 126% in March and October 2005, respectively, reducing a major distortion \nthrough a bold move. Clearly, tariffs should follow the full cost recovery principle to encourage \ngreater PSP and enhance efficiency in the allocation of resources. At the same time, the ability \nof the poor to pay for infrastructure services needs to be considered. \n                                                 \n6  In the first half of the 1990s capacity expansion by independent power producers helped attract major private \ninvestments and thereby eliminate power shortages in Southeast Asia. However, the financial crisis highlighted the \nrisks of the then prevailing long-term take-or-pay contracts indexed to exchange rates, namely, the so-called triple \nmismatch. The currency mismatch resulted from the use of foreign exchange to implement projects generating \nrevenues in local currency. After the currency meltdown in Indonesia, passing the foreign exchange risk on to \nconsumers was impossible and the Government had to bail out the State Electricity Corporation (PLN). The \nmaturity mismatch was attributable to the use of short-term loans for some capital-intensive projects with long \nservice lives. And, finally, the capacity mismatch resulted from a conversion of the previous power shortages into \nsignificant surpluses, partly because of capacity overcontracting and partly due to the slowdown in demand growth \nin the aftermath of the crisis.  \n ", "7 \n20.  Failure  to  Achieve  Equity  and  Efficiency:  Public  Service  Obligations.  Full  cost \nrecovery  can  only  be  achieved  gradually  over  time.  Even  in  the  long  term,  low-income \ncustomers may not be able to pay for infrastructure services, and there are limitations on cross-\nsubsidization by more affluent customer categories. The current situation differs from sector to \nsector, with no uniform PSO approach. Loss-making port and airport facilities are either cross-\nsubsidized in SOE portfolios or left to line ministries to operate and finance from their budget.7 \nIn the power sector, the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) receives a major annual subsidy from \nthe Government budget to offset losses in all consumer categories, for which the tariff is set \nbelow PLN\u2019s cost of supply. The subsidy was Rp12.5 trillion ($1.4 billion) in 2005 and budgeted \nat Rp28 trillion ($3.1 billion) for 2006. The very low tariffs for water supply result in the poor \nfinancial  condition  and  high  indebtedness  of  the  regional  water  supply  companies.  The \nGovernment provides annual subsidies of about Rp20 billion ($2.2 million) for bus transport on \n119 subdistrict routes, and about Rp76 billion ($8.4 million) for ferry transport on 64 river and \ninterisland  routes;  these  represent  the  so-called  pioneer  services.  The  Government  also \nsubsidizes railway operations and pioneer shipping and air transport services. Despite that, low \neconomy-class railway fares impair the financial viability of the Indonesian Railway Corporation. \nIn the telecommunications sector, Government Regulation 28/2005 allows 0.75% of revenues of \nprivate companies to be retained for subsidized rural services. \n \n21.  To achieve greater PSP and higher efficiencies in PSO provision, a consistent PSO \nframework is needed, including an implementation policy and sector-specific guidelines. While \nthe public sector will continue to have an important role in delivering many noncommercial \nservices, innovative approaches allowing PSP could include output-based aid that is explicit, \ntargeted, and driven by the service provider\u2019s performance.  \n \n22.  Shallow Domestic Financing Modalities. Banking plays a dominant role within the \nfinancial system, accounting for about 82% of overall assets. Capital markets have grown in \nimportance, but long-term debt issuance has until recently been limited to Government bonds. \nThe issuance of corporate bonds has grown gradually to just under $6 billion in 2005, with only \na very small portion originating from SOEs operating in the infrastructure sectors. On the supply \nside,  contractual  savings  institutions  such  as  pension  and  insurance  companies  have \ntraditionally  invested  predominantly  in  Government  bonds  or  bank  deposits.  While  the \nGovernment  estimates  that  domestic  financial  institutions  can  meet  about  20%  of  the \ninfrastructure  funding  requirements,  concerted  reforms  are  needed  to  mobilize  domestic \nresources of this magnitude. Domestic financing would help reduce the currency mismatch and \nthe extent of Government guarantees. The Government needs to facilitate the development of \nlocal capital markets by enabling insurance firms and pension funds to finance infrastructure, \ndeepening the bond market, strengthening credit-rating, establishing dedicated infrastructure \nfunds, and allowing regional governments to borrow for infrastructure in local markets. \n \nc.  Other Constraints Impeding Infrastructure Development \n23.  Weak Legal, Regulatory, and Implementation Framework for Land Acquisition. \nLand acquisition problems have impeded several infrastructure projects, particularly toll roads. \nUntil recently, land acquisition was governed by the old Basic Agrarian Law and Presidential \nRegulation (Perpres) 55/1993 on land acquisition for public infrastructure. While providing a \nlegal basis, these documents failed to balance the need to protect social safeguards vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe need for expeditious provision of land or right-of-way access needed for infrastructure \ndevelopment. As the cost of land is generally high, an effective mechanism is needed to finance \nland acquisition in a timely manner without leading to uncertainties and excessive speculation. \n                                                 \n7  Six SOEs operate 111 ports and 23 airports, leaving the remaining 606 noncommercial ports and 164 airports to be \nmanaged by the Ministry of Transportation.  \n   ", "8   \nIn many countries, land acquisition for large infrastructure projects is done by the public sector \nas its contribution to the investment costs of PPP projects.  \n \n24.  Lack  of  Clarity  Due  to  Regional  Autonomy.  Decentralization,  while  devolving \nconsiderable authority and autonomy to local governments, has complicated matters related to \ninfrastructure development. Responsibility for the provision of infrastructure services and the \nrole of local government-owned enterprises (BUMDs) has not been clearly articulated. Local \ngovernments, with control over local infrastructure, have not been provided adequate funds and \nmost lack the necessary capacity.  \n \n25.  Safety, Security, and Asset Maintenance. Access and connectivity are vital in the \nIndonesian  archipelago.  Adherence  to  safety  and  security  standards  for  various  modes  of \ntransportation is equally critical. The Government recently began adopting safety and security \nnorms,  and  establishing  the  necessary  institutional  mechanisms.  In  the  road  sector, \nmaintenance gets varying levels of attention across the country, with national and provincial \nroads reasonably well preserved but district and urban roads in poor condition due to gross \nunderspending on maintenance. Safety norms for road use and vehicle overloading are only \nslowly  emerging,  and  enforcement  is  weak.  Safety  is  also  an  issue  for  air  and  sea \ntransportation,  due  to  disparities  in  the  adoption  of  safety  norms  across  the  country  and \nineffective enforcement.  \n \nd.  Summary of Constraints \n \n26.  Poor Governance and Resource Constraints. In the aftermath of the 1997 financial \ncrisis, four facets of governance that impede infrastructure development have emerged: (i) \nabsence of sound PSP policies and framework; (ii) opaqueness in bidding, and corruption and \nrent-seeking during implementation affecting both public and private sectors; (iii) inequality in \naccess  to  opportunities  by  the  public  and  private  sector;  and  (iv)  weak  cross-sectoral \ncoordination. The impact of poor governance has been aggravated by the fiscal and other \nresource-related  impediments  affecting  public  and  private  investments  in  infrastructure:  (a) \ndeclining  institutional  capacity  for  sector  planning;  (b)  lack  of  focus  on,  and  inadequate \nresources allocated to, project preparation; (c) lack of risk sharing; (d) lack of cost recovery, \nwhich threatens the financial viability of projects; (e) inability of the public sector to finance land \nacquisition; and (f) lack of long-term financial intermediation (Figure 1, page 9).  \n \n2.  Lessons  \n27.  The role of program lending as a vehicle for economic growth and poverty reduction is \nthoroughly examined in several studies leading to the following principal conclusions:8  \n \n(i)  Policy frameworks have often been complex and unrealistic. \n(ii)  A high degree of formal compliance with conditions does not necessarily lead to \nhigh quality compliance in terms of reform implementation and sustainability, nor \nis it a guarantee of the desired outcome and impact.  \n(iii)  Political economy factors such as the commitment to, and timing of, reforms; \nextent of the underlying problems; appreciation by the public of the seriousness \nof these problems; and length of the government term are critical and should be \neffectively factored into the design of programs.  \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005.

Taking into account these lessons, recent evaluation studies (footnote 8) recommend \nthe following:  \n \n(i)  Policy measures should focus on the main objectives of the program, and each \naction should be specific and directly related to the objectives. \n(ii)  Program design should allow not only the standard multiple tranche design, but \nalso options with a single tranche, floating tranches, and a program cluster. Such \nflexibility is particularly important when actions beyond government control are \nnecessary, such as legislative measures.  \n(iii)  Reforms  should  be  phased  in  and  fully  aligned  with  the  country\u2019s  broader \nmedium-term development agenda. \n(iv)  Development partners should harmonize and coordinate their policy advice. \n \n29.  In general, progress in policy reform has been slow and gradual in Indonesia after the \nfinancial  crisis  due  to  political  economy  considerations,  decentralization,  and  the  complex \nstructure of bureaucratic decision making. In the infrastructure sectors, reforms have been \nimpeded by overlapping and conflicting responsibilities across a number of line ministries, \nagencies, and national and local government jurisdictions. Most of the findings of the special \nevaluation  study  are  mirrored  in  an  evaluation  of  the  power  sector  restructuring  program \nsupported by ADB through a policy-based loan of $380 million and a technical assistance loan \nof $20 million, with cofinancing of $400 million from JBIC.9 The program focused on sector \nregulation, unbundling, financial viability, PSP, and competition. The evaluation found that the \nimplementation schedule was unrealistic and the program objectives too ambitious. On the \npositive side, the legal framework was established, first steps toward unbundling PLN were \ntaken, PLN\u2019s financial viability was to a large degree restored, and conditions were created for \ncontinued PSP through postcrisis contract renegotiation with independent power producers. \nHowever, implementation took much longer than originally planned; release of the second \ntranche  of  the  program  loan  was  delayed  by  more  than  2  years;  and  the  objectives  of \nintroducing wholesale competition and divesting government majority stakes in the unbundled \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution companies were not achieved. The annulment of the \nElectricity Law 20/2002 by the Constitutional Court in December 2004 put further restructuring \non hold. Overall, the program was rated as partly successful. \n \n30.  The  current  political  economy  factors  generally  bode  well  for  IRSDP  success.  The \nGovernment has not yet reached the midpoint of its term. It has made accelerated infrastructure \ndevelopment a key pillar of its agenda and expressed the political will to proceed with necessary \nreforms, supported by a credible team of economic ministers. As the IRSDP is fully anchored on \nthe Government\u2019s Infrastructure Policy Package, ownership of the relevant line ministries as \nwell as oversight agencies such as the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), \nCoordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA), and Ministry of Finance (MOF) is strong. The \ngeneral public experiences the infrastructure bottlenecks and the poor quality of infrastructure \nservices on a daily basis. Consequently, the majority support the reforms, as demonstrated by \ntheir acceptance of the steep oil price increases in March and October 2005. Nevertheless, the \nreform agenda is broad and challenging as it covers all infrastructure sectors, and vested \ninterests oppose parts of it. This underlines the need for flexibility in reform implementation. \n \n31.  Based on these considerations, a program cluster modality is proposed for the IRSDP. \nThe  program  cluster  will  consist  of  three  single-tranche  subprograms  anchored  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s Infrastructure Policy Package. The policy actions are allocated to three phases \neach of 21 months: January 2005\u2013September 2006 for subprogram (SP) 1, October 2006\u2013June \n2008 for SP2, and July 2008\u2013March 2010 for SP3. The flexible program structure helps deflect \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2004. Program Completion Report on the Power Sector Restructuring Program in Indonesia.

Appendix 3 presents the \nGovernment\u2019s development policy letter outlining its commitment for the IRSDP, along with the \npolicy matrix, which outlines the IRSDP structure. Appendix 4 summarizes important outcomes \naccomplished thus far as part of SP1. \n \n3.  External Assistance \n \n32.  Traditionally, ADB, JBIC, and the World Bank have been the Government\u2019s principal \ndevelopment  partners  in  the  infrastructure  sectors.  The  overall  IRSDP  design  and \nimplementation of reform measures thus far under SP1 have benefited from close cooperation \nof the three institutions. In addition, the development partners and the Government have taken \ninto account the views and concerns of the private sector.10 Close coordination among the \ndevelopment partners, including the Government of Japan (through the Strategic Investment \nAction Plan) and the Australian Agency for International Development, has ensured that the \ncombined resources are effectively utilized. Particularly noteworthy is the efficient use of TA \nresources for capacity development, risk management, and preparation of PPP projects. The \ndevelopment partners, in collaboration with other stakeholders, have also focused on improving \ngovernance and anticorruption in infrastructure provision. At the same time, the fact that the \nIRSDP  is  founded  on  the  Government\u2019s  own  policy  agenda  helps  reduce  concerns  about \nexternal pressures for reform. Based on the joint work as well as given the overall benefits of \nharmonizing  development  support,  the  Government  of  Japan  and  the  World  Bank  are \nconsidering cofinancing the IRSDP; building on the earlier joint financing by ADB and JBIC in \nthe power sector (2001); and the parallel financing from the World Bank, Japan and ADB for the \nDevelopment Policy Support Program (2005). Appendix 5 contains the development partner \ncoordination matrix, outlining support in areas related to the IRSDP. \n \n4.  Rationale and Linkage with Other ADB Assistance \n33.  IRSDP design and implementation have been closely coordinated with ongoing and \nplanned ADB programs and projects. ADB is adopting a dual-track approach to enhance the \nlinkage  and  synergy  between  cross-cutting  macroeconomic  reforms  and  deeper  sector \nreforms.11 The measures supported under the IRSDP facilitate ADB provision of significant \ndevelopment assistance to Indonesia through both public and private sector operations. Two \nmajor private sector operations of ADB in the gas sector were approved recently, increasing \nADB\u2019s direct support for private sector development in Indonesia. The IRSDP reforms will \nenhance sustainability of the recent and planned investments by strengthening the policy and \nregulatory framework, particularly in the toll-road, gas, and power sectors. Lessons from the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  public  and  private  sector  projects  will  feed  into  reforms  in \nsubsequent phases of the IRSDP. The new country strategy and program for Indonesia, with its \nfocus  on  improving  the  investment  climate,  envisages  deeper  support  for  private  sector \ndevelopment, through a stronger linkage between ADB\u2019s public and private sector operations. In \naddition, the IRSDP will act as a vehicle to help implement important cross-cutting initiatives \nbeing pioneered by ADB in the region such as the Clean Energy Initiative and the Water \nFinancing Program.  \n                                                 \n10 For example, two power sector meetings\u2014in Tokyo in March 2004 and in London in May 2004\u2014were organized \nwith support from ADB, JBIC, and World Bank. The concerns raised by the private sector related to government \nguarantees for power sector investment, sanctity of power purchase agreements, future structure of the power \nsector, retail electricity tariffs, power sector planning and regulation, and foreign exchange risk mitigation. \n11  ADB.2005.

Manila, (para. 7, Loan 2228-INO), outlines \nthis dual-track approach. \n   ", "12   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n34.  The IRSDP will improve the investment climate and support timely realization of the \nGovernment\u2019s medium-term macroeconomic goals, in particular achieving average annual GDP \ngrowth of 6%\u20137% during 2005\u20132009 by enhancing infrastructure provision and access. This will \nenable the Government to reduce poverty and boost job creation. The expected outcome of the \nIRSDP is accelerated infrastructure development through large-scale PSP and mobilization, and \nallocation of additional public sector resources.  \n \nB.  Important Features \n \n35.  The IRSDP has a number of noteworthy features. First, its overall design is fully in line \nwith the Government\u2019s medium-term development growth vision, as articulated in the RPJM, \nand the Government\u2019s infrastructure reform agenda, as formulated in the Infrastructure Policy \nPackage. Second, designed as a program cluster consisting of three subprograms, the IRSDP \nprovides the necessary flexibility to an emerging middle-income country like Indonesia that is \ngoing  through  democratic  and  political  transition  to  build  consensus  for  reforms  among \nstakeholders with competing interests. It also ensures continuity of reforms resulting in a natural \nprogression from actions to desired outcomes.  \n \n36.  Third,  the  IRSDP  helps  address  investment  climate  impediments,  a  major  area  of \nconcern in Indonesia. The program supports measures to enhance investments in infrastructure \nprovision, including well-defined sector policies and blueprints outlining the medium and long-\nterm priorities; clear legal and regulatory framework that results in equal access and conditions \nand  independent  regulatory  arrangements  over  the  medium  term;  efficient  risk-sharing \nmechanisms to enable greater PSP; strengthened fiduciary management in determining public \nsector investments in PPP projects; and improved governance and transparency in the selection \nof private sector partners to minimize the risks of corruption that has afflicted investments in the \npast  in  Indonesia.  The  IRSDP\u2019s  focus  on  accelerating  infrastructure  provision  will  in  turn \npromote and facilitate other business investments. Several surveys12 show that the inadequate \nprovision and poor quality of infrastructure services, and disparities in service coverage are \nmajor impediments in increasing domestic and foreign investments in Indonesia. Fulfilling PSOs \nis a key cross-cutting area that has an indirect impact in terms of attracting investments in the \nfuture. As the Indonesian economy grows and investments increase, the widespread disparities \nin development across the country must be addressed. Reducing potential discontent among \nthe poor and other vulnerable segments of the population is particularly relevant in underserved \nareas with significant natural resource potential, where investments may initially benefit only a \nfew segments of the local population before the benefits can reach the communities at large. \n \n37.  Finally,  in  a  thematic  sense,  the  principal  focus  of  the  IRSDP  is  to  strengthen \ngovernance and alleviate resource constraints in infrastructure provision.

The IRSDP supports the formulation and/or adoption of \nthe following:  \n \n\u2022  Legal and regulatory framework that provides for transparent and competitive bidding to select \nprivate sector partners, even for unsolicited proposals \n\u2022  Risk-sharing framework that focuses on project quality and transparency in deciding on the \ntype  and  amount  of  Government  support,  and  that  stipulates  that  such  support  can be \nprovided only if indicated in the bidding documents \n\u2022  Gradual dismantling of state-owned enterprise monopolies and creation of a level playing field \nin as many sectors as feasible  \n\u2022  Sector-specific  measures  to  deal  with  corruption,  such  as  adoption  of  standard  bidding \ndocuments and initiation of e-procurement in the road sector  \n\u2022  Preparation and transaction execution in a transparent manner for about 25\u201330 model PPP \nprojects  to  demonstrate  the  merits  of  the  new  private  sector  participation  and  risk \nmanagement frameworks \n \nIRSDP = Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program; PPP = public-private partnership \nC.  The Program Loan \n \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n38.  The IRSDP policy framework is founded on three reform pillars:  \n \n(i)  Strategic cross-sectoral reforms will result in \n(a)  improved  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  framework  for  greater  PSP \nanchored on good governance principles; \n(b)   a well-structured risk management framework that promotes PSP;  \n(c)  accelerated  mobilization  of  domestic  long-term  financial  resources  for \ninfrastructure  development,  and  establishment  of  innovative  funding \nmechanisms to finance PPP transactions; and \n(d)  a streamlined regional autonomy framework, clearly delineating functional \nresponsibilities  of  national  and  local  governments  in  infrastructure \nprovision. \n \n(ii)  Sector-specific policy, legal, and institutional reforms13 will lead to   \n \n(a)  improved financial soundness and sustainability of infrastructure services \nthrough full cost recovery; \n(b)  greater competition that benefits consumers through improved service \ndelivery and lower tariffs; \n(c)  independent regulatory structures that are distinct from the contracting \nand operating functions;  \n(d)  equal  access  and  opportunities  for  all  participants,  and  prevention  of \nabuse of natural monopoly rights; and \n(e)  fulfillment of the PSOs of infrastructure service providers, in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction objectives.  \n                                                 \n13  The sector coverage of the IRSDP includes transportation (roads; ports and airports; and railways); power; oil and \ngas; telecommunications; and water supply and sanitation. \n   ", "14   \n \n(iii)  Facilitation of preparation and execution of well-structured project transactions \nwill result in sound model infrastructure projects that can be replicated. \n \n2.

Strategic Cross-Sector Reforms \n40.  Legal and Institutional Framework to Promote PSP. Based on the IRSDP policy \ndialogue, the Government issued Perpres 67/2005 on Cooperation between the Government \nand Business Entities in the Provision of Infrastructure in November 2005 to provide a more \ncomprehensive PSP framework and thereby establish a clear and predictable environment \nwithin  which  private  investors  will  operate.  Perpres  67/2005  defines  two  forms  of  PSP:  \npartnership and licensing agreements. These agreements should specify, among other things, \n ", "15 \nthe project scope, period of partnership/license, implementation/operation warranty, tariff and \ntariff adjustment mechanism, risks and obligations, performance standards, dispute resolution, \nand supervision method. PPP projects can be identified and prepared either by the Government \nor the private sector, but the sponsors must be selected through open and transparent bidding. \nPerpres 67/2005 describes in detail the rules and procedures for the bidding process, and calls \nfor tariffs to be set at full cost-recovery. If this exceeds the affordability of consumers to pay, the \nGovernment  must  compensate  for  the  difference  with  a  PSO  subsidy.  Perpres  67/2005 \nrecommends that risks be allocated to the party that is best able to manage and control them. \n \n41.  Strengthening  Institutional  and  Coordination  Arrangements  for  PSP.  Perpres \n42/2005 issued in May 2005 strengthens the ability of the interministerial National Committee for \nthe  Acceleration  of  Infrastructure  Development  (KKPPI)14  to  fulfill  its  role  in  formulating \ninfrastructure strategies and policies, coordinating and supervising the implementation of these \nstrategies and policies by the line ministries and local governments, formulating PSO policy for \ninfrastructure services, and solving problems that impede infrastructure development by the \npublic  and  private  sector.  CMEA  Regulation  1/2006  issued  in  May  2006  outlines  the \norganization structure of the KKPPI Secretariat and describes its tasks, which include resolving \ncross-sectoral issues, preparing and updating medium- and long-term infrastructure investment \nplans,  reviewing  and  prioritizing  requests  for  Government  support  for  PPP  projects,  and \nconducting stakeholder consultations. The secretariat is headed by the deputy minister for \ninfrastructure and regional development in CMEA (in charge of administrative and private sector \ncoordination) and the deputy minister for infrastructure affairs in BAPPENAS (in charge of \ntechnical  support).  The  KKPPI  Secretariat  needs  sustained  capacity  building  and  advisory \nsupport to fulfill its responsibilities.15 \n \n42.  For  the  day-to-day  coordination  and  management  of  PPP  transactions,  a  network \nconsisting  of  a  central PPP  unit  under  the  KKPPI  Secretariat  and PPP  nodes  in  the  line \nministries is being developed.16 With the execution of PPP transactions devolved to the line \nministries and contracting agencies, the central PPP unit will be responsible for ensuring policy \nconsistency, quality control, and transparency by establishing standards and principles that all \ntransactions must follow, and by monitoring the execution for compliance. Given the massive \ninvestment  needs  against  limited  capital  resources,  the  unit  will  prioritize  PPP  projects \naccording to their development impact and readiness for implementation. Other tasks include \nassisting line ministries and local governments in identifying, preparing, and implementing PPP \nprojects; reviewing project evaluation carried out by the PPP nodes; evaluating requests for \nGovernment support needed for PPP projects; coordinating such support with MOF; publishing \nstatus  reports  on  PPP  projects  and  disseminating  other  relevant  information;  preparing \nguidelines and manuals for PPP projects; and building capacity in the PPP nodes. \n \n43.  To  ensure  adequate  information  on  infrastructure  development  among  the  various \nstakeholders, the Consolidated Indonesia Infrastructure Forum was established in 2005, initially \nas a unit under CMEA with financial support from the World Bank. The forum is intended to \nbecome an independent stand-alone self-financing organization. The forum is to act as an \neffective bridge between the KKPPI and the private sector, to ensure common understanding. \n                                                 \n14  The KKPPI, which reports directly to the President, is cochaired by the coordinating minister of economic affairs \nand the chairperson of BAPPENAS, the latter acting as the executive chair. Its members include the ministers of \nfinance, home affairs, energy and mineral resources, public works, transportation, communications and informatics, \nand state-owned enterprises, as well as the cabinet secretary.  \n15  ADB is providing capacity building for the BAPPENAS part of the KKPPI Secretariat through a TA grant (ADB. \n2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Support for Infrastructure Development. Manila [TA \n4728-INO for $2 million]). The World Bank has been supporting the CMEA part of the KKPPI Secretariat and the \nline ministries through its $17.3 million Private Provision of Infrastructure Technical Assistance loan. \n16  The Private Provision of Infrastructure Technical Assistance loan has been tapped for designing and establishing \nthe central PPP unit and its network. \n   ", "16   \nGiven  the  importance  of  such  stakeholder  consultations,  the  forum  needs  to  be  fully \noperationalized as soon as possible. \n \n44.  Adoption of a Risk Management Framework. The Government is developing a risk \nmanagement framework for the infrastructure sectors as an instrument for assessing, pricing, \nmonitoring, and managing contingent liabilities that arise from selective guarantees for PPP \nprojects against risks related to policies and performance of the Government and its agencies. \nIn view of the links to its existing budgeting, fiscal accounting, and debt management systems, \nMOF has been playing an important role in developing and implementing the framework. In \nOctober 2005, the minister of finance issued Regulation 518/2005 on the establishment of the \nRisk Management Committee, which specified its structure and principal tasks. Apart from \nmaking recommendations on the appropriate risk management policy, the committee was to \nperform the risk management function before the creation of a permanent Risk Management \nUnit in MOF\u2019s new Fiscal Policy Office. The risk management function involves examining \nrequests for Government support for PPP projects submitted by the contracting authorities, \nscreened by the PPP  nodes in the line ministries, reviewed and prioritized by the KKPPI \nSecretariat with the help of the central PPP unit, and endorsed by the KKPPI; setting the \nparameters and targets for PPP agreements; and monitoring performance of PPP projects \nduring their operation. Support for the Risk Management Unit will be provided through the TA \nattached to the IRSDP (para. 94).  \n \n45.  In May 2006 the minister of finance issued Regulation 38/2006 on the risk management \npolicy to ensure that risks of individual PPP projects are appropriately allocated between the \npublic and private sectors, and that the Government\u2019s overall exposure is well managed. The \ndual objective of the policy is to support infrastructure development while maintaining fiscal \nsustainability of the Government budget. The new regulation describes the types of risks the \nGovernment may consider sharing (those related to political events, project performance, and \ndemand), the main principles for providing such support (legality, project quality in terms of \ntechnical and financial feasibility, fiscal prudence in terms of total exposure and annual budget, \nand transparency), and approval procedures. The MOF regulation was complemented in June \n2006  by  CMEA  Regulation  4/2006  on  the  evaluation  procedure  for  projects  requiring \nGovernment support. While reiterating the project quality, fiscal prudence, and transparency \nprinciples, this regulation outlines the roles of the KKPPI, its secretariat, and the central PPP \nunit in the evaluation; and specifies in detail the documentation needed and criteria to be met, \nsuch  as  the  feasibility  study,  environmental  impact  analysis,  socioeconomic  benefit-cost \nanalysis, risk analysis, bidding documents (including draft concession agreement), and the \nproject\u2019s compatibility with the RPJM, sector strategic plan, and regional spatial plan. As to the \ntransparency principle, the regulation stipulates that requests for Government support must be \nsubmitted before bidding.  \n \n46.  Supporting Land Acquisition. Intensive stakeholder review and feedback, including \ncomments from international investors at the February 2006 Infrastructure Forum, resulted in \nthe adoption of Perpres 65/2006 in June 2006 to amend Perpres 36/2005.17 Together, the two \nregulations have the potential to move the Government\u2019s policies on land acquisition closer to \ninternationally  accepted  principles  on  involuntary  resettlement,  particularly  with  regard  to \nprovisions on the use of market prices and recognition of nonphysical losses. The National Land \nAgency has drafted implementing regulations, which provide for both aspects. For projects \nserving public interest, expropriation is allowed after 120 days if no agreement is reached with \nlandowners. The period for negotiations excludes the time required for identification, valuation, \n                                                 \n17  Replacing Perpres 55/1993 on land acquisition for public infrastructure and providing for independent valuation of \nproperty to reduce opportunity for speculation; expanding the definition of public interest to areas such as piped \nwater, power transmission lines, and sanitary landfills; and clarifying the period of negotiations before any recourse \nby expropriation can be sought. \n ", "17 \nand notification of the asset owner. While gaps still exist in terms of ADB policy requirements on \nlivelihood restoration, consultation, grievance redress, and rights of squatters, the Government \nis considering how to address these through the implementing regulations. In addition, some of \nthese  gaps  may  be  addressed  in  planned  amendments  to  the  Basic  Agrarian  Law.  As \ndemonstrated by the unsuccessful bidding for several toll-road projects, investors are unwilling \nto bear the land acquisition risk. Therefore land acquisition must be completed prior to bidding. \nMOF  is  finalizing  its  plans  on  appropriate  institutional  arrangements  for  financing  land \nacquisition  from  the  budget,  with  reimbursement  from  investors  once  their  projects  are \ncompleted and yield revenue.  \n \n47.  Diversifying and Strengthening Financing Modalities and Mechanisms. MOF has \nprepared a policy paper outlining measures needed to mobilize resources through various \nmodalities and mechanisms to provide financing for PPP projects. The paper covers the entire \nspectrum of financing needs, from project preparation to implementation, for both public and \nprivate  investments  and  guarantees:  (i)  PDF  for  preparing  national  and  decentralized \ninfrastructure projects; (ii) a PPP infrastructure financing fund to help meet the public sector \nportion of PPP transactions, including land acquisition and other upfront investments; (iii) a \nguarantee fund to provide backing for government support; and (iv) an Indonesia infrastructure \nfund to offer project financing to the private sector. Given the weaknesses in project preparation \nthat have impeded execution of PPP transactions, establishment of the PDF merits top priority.  \n \n48.  Addressing  Intergovernmental  Coordination  Issues:  The  issues  related  to \nintergovernmental fiscal relations, local government borrowing (including onlending and on-\ngranting of foreign loans by the central Government to local governments), and workout of local \ngovernment debt arrears are being addressed by strengthening the relevant legal framework.18 \nThese efforts have been supported by two policy-based operations of ADB19 and the World \nBank,20 approved in late 2005. As part of the IRSDP, the Government has drafted a regulation \nclarifying national and local government responsibilities in infrastructure provision, operation, \ncontracting, and regulation. The Government has also drafted a law on BUMDs. Under the new \nlegal framework on decentralization,21 local governments may issue bonds in local currency. \nHowever, the financial soundness of local governments needs to be thoroughly assessed, and \nan appropriate legal framework adopted that clearly outlines the criteria for central Government \napproval and recourse, besides credit-rating and other oversight requirements.22 \n \nb.  Sector Policy, Legal, and Institutional Reforms \n49.  Roads.  The  new  Road  Law  38/2004  and  the  subsequent  Government  Regulation \n15/2005 on Toll Roads reformed the legal framework and are facilitating greater PSP.23 They \nhave unbundled the sector by separating the regulatory functions from the main SOE, Jasa \nMarga; calling for the establishment of a new regulatory body; ending Jasa Marga\u2019s monopoly \non toll-road development; and allowing private investors to bid for new build-operate-transfer or \nconcession projects in competition with Jasa Marga. In August 2005, the Ministry of Public \nWorks (MPW) issued Decree 374/2005, which enables the toll-road tariffs to be set on the basis \n                                                 \n18  Enactment of the Law on Regional Fiscal Balance 33/2004, and ongoing revisions to Government Regulation \n107/2000 and Ministerial Decree 35/2003.  \n19  ADB. 2005.

At the same time, tariffs for existing toll roads were increased by 15%\u2013\n50% to ensure financial sustainability of their operation. To complete the legal framework, MPW \nhas  been  issuing  a  series  of  implementing  regulations.  Road  Law  38/2004  will  be \ncomplemented by the new Law on Road Traffic and Transportation, drafted by the Ministry of \nTransportation (MOT) and submitted to Parliament, providing many opportunities for PSP in \ntransport services, transport infrastructure such as bus terminals and parking, and support \nservices such as vehicle inspection. \n \n50.  As stipulated by the new legal framework, the Indonesian Toll Road Authority was \nestablished  in  October  2005.  Its  responsibilities  include  developing  business  plans  and \nfeasibility studies for toll-road projects; conducting bidding, facilitating land acquisition, and \nrecommending  tariffs  for  such  projects;  and  supervising  implementation  of  toll-road \nconcessions.  The  authority,  which  reports  to  the  minister  of  public  works,  comprises  a \nchairperson and four members from the Government, road association, universities, and other \nstakeholders. To ensure complementarity of toll roads with other parts of the road network, the \ntoll-road authority works closely with MPW\u2019s Directorate General of Highways. The short-term \nchallenge  is  to  fully  operationalize  the  authority.  In  the  medium  term,  a  separation  of  its \ncontracting and regulatory functions, and making the latter fully independent of MPW, should be \nconsidered.24 \n \n51.  Institutional capacity in the road sector is still weak in some aspects. While national \nasset management capacity is being strengthened, capacity building for development planning \nand operation and maintenance is needed. Regional agencies vary considerably in capacity and \nperformance, and interagency coordination is weak. Heavy vehicle overloading is prevalent, \nroad preservation costs are increasing significantly, and road safety is poor. The implementation \nof road works is often expensive and of low quality, and collusion among contractors is a \nproblem. The business practices and performance of national agencies and the construction \nindustry  need  to  be  improved  and  capacity  of  the  regional  agencies  built  up.  Regulatory \nenforcement to reduce vehicle overloading needs strengthening and a comprehensive road \nsafety program implemented. MPW, together with MOT and with assistance from the World \nBank, is preparing two initiatives in these areas: a pilot road safety program in Semarang and \npilot  testing  of  performance-based  contracts  for  road  maintenance,  including  vehicle  load \ncontrol, in central Java. To increase transparency and reduce opportunities for corruption, MPW \nhas adopted standard bidding documents and is developing an e-procurement system for all \nroad contracts. Moving forward, a comprehensive action program of anticorruption measures in \nthe areas of procurement, transparency and accountability, auditing, and human resources will \nbe formulated and implemented under SP2 and SP3. \n \n52.  To put the financing of road maintenance on a self-sustained basis, restructuring of \nvehicle-related taxes needs to be considered. The restructuring should lead to a system of road-\nuser charges that ensures full recovery of the necessary road preservation costs, and reflects \nactual road usage and the contribution of various vehicle categories to these costs. In particular, \ncharges for heavy vehicles should be related to their load capacity and road-damaging effects. \nIn the medium term, the establishment of a transparent accounting mechanism such as a road \nfund should be considered. Measures are also necessary in the medium term that separate the \noperator and regulatory functions, and make the latter independent of MPW, which sets overall \nsector policy. \n                                                 \n24  Such independence can be achieved by giving the regulatory body statutory authority and ensuring that it has \nadequate technical expertise, reports to the President of Indonesia, has no financial stake in any sector operator, is \nfinancially autonomous through funding from levies on the regulated industry, is headed by commissioners \nappointed for fixed terms and on the basis of transparent selection criteria, and has appropriate stakeholder \nrepresentation.  \n \n ", "19 \n53.  Ports and Airports. The legal and regulatory framework needs to be revised to end the \nmonopolies of the four SOEs in the port sector and two SOEs in the airport sector, as well as \ntheir multiple roles of landlord, regulator, contracting authority for the provision of port/airport \nservices, and operator. In addition, the creation of a separate provider of air traffic services \nshould be considered. Significant progress has already been made in revising the legal and \nregulatory framework. Presidential Decree 5/2005 on Empowering Domestic Shipping Industry \npromotes  the  separation  of  regulatory  and  operational  functions  in  ports,  and  encourages \ncompetition among operators within and between ports. MOT has completed the drafting of new \nlaws for sea transport and aviation, and submitted them to Parliament. It is important that the \nnew  laws,  including  the  subsequent  implementing  regulations,  provide  for  such  sector \nrestructuring. In particular, the legal framework should allow the establishment of true landlord \nport  and  airport  structures  where  landlords  have  no  direct  financial  stake  in  any  service \nproviders, and should clarify the roles and responsibilities of local governments. \n  \n54.  The creation of landlord structures where operating concessions can be competitively \ntendered with no conflict of interest from the landlord will require restructuring the six SOEs to \nfocus on either the landlord or operating role. As each of these SOEs manages a group of loss- \nand profit-making ports/airports, such restructuring will also help in efficiently managing the \nPSOs.  In  the  airport  sector,  separating  air  traffic  services  will  significantly  reduce  SOE \nrevenues. Tariff adjustments to reflect cost recovery will help offset this reduction. Regulation of \ntariffs, safety and service standards, and licensing can continue to be the responsibility of MOT, \nbut in the medium term, the creation of independent regulatory bodies should be pursued, with \nMOT in charge of policy making, planning, and coordination. \n \n55.  Railways. MOT has completed the drafting of a new railway law and submitted it to \nParliament. If enacted in its current form, the new law will end the monopoly of the Indonesian \nRailway Corporation in operating rolling stock and maintaining infrastructure, and allow private \nservice provision without forming a joint venture with the railway corporation. To succeed in \ncompetition for the market with private sector service providers, the corporation will have to \nimprove its management and operation. In the medium term, ensuring equal conditions for all \nservice providers by establishing an independent regulatory body is important. Transparent tariff \nsetting and PSO arrangements will also go a long way in encouraging PSP.25 \n \n56.  Power. To remove the legal uncertainty caused by the ruling of the Constitutional Court \nin December 2004, which automatically led to reenactment of the previous Electricity Law \n15/1985, Government Regulation 3/2005 on Electricity Procurement and Utilization was issued \nin January 2005, followed by two ministerial decrees. While giving the principal authority for \npower supply to PLN, the regulation and decrees allow purchase of electricity by PLN from \nindependent power producers. This is an interim solution until a new law is in place, for which \npublic  consultations  are  being  held  by  Parliament.  The  new  law,  while  respecting  the \nConstitution,  should  retain  the  spirit  of  the  annulled  law,  and  be  quickly  followed  by \nimplementing regulations. Given the controversy and uncertainty caused by the ruling of the \nConstitutional Court, stakeholder consultations are essential for reaching a consensus on how \nto reduce PLN\u2019s monopoly and increase competition in the longer term, while retaining control of \nthe sector through stronger planning and regulation. Nevertheless, as PLN will continue to \ndominate the sector in the foreseeable future, its institutional capacity in areas such as project \nplanning  and  implementation,  financial  management,  and  corporate  governance  should  be \nstrengthened. The planned PLN corporate restructuring study will support this effort.  \n \n                                                 \n25 At present, the passenger fares for economy class travel are set by MOT based on the ability to pay, with the \ndifference to the actual cost to be reimbursed to the Indonesian Railway Corporation, which implements this PSO \npolicy,  while  other  passenger  fares  and  all  freight  fares  can  be  set  by  the  corporation  subject  to  MOT\u2019s \nendorsement.  \n   ", "20   \n57.  Restoring  PLN\u2019s  financial  viability  is  crucial  for  enhancing  its  creditworthiness.  If \nindependent power producers and their financiers have doubts about PLN\u2019s ability to pay their \nbills,  the  demand  for  Government  guarantees  against  this  off-take  risk  will  rise  and  the \nadditional installed capacity requirements may not be met. Originally, the Government planned \nto increase the average electricity tariff by at least 15% in early 2006. However, because of the \nnegative impact of the previous fuel subsidy reductions and interest rate increases on inflation \nand economic growth, and the Government\u2019s concern about the likelihood of major public \nprotests, the tariff increase has been deferred. The Government recognizes that cost recovery \nmust be achieved once the political and macroeconomic conditions allow. Its medium-term \nstrategy is to combine tariff increases with cost-saving measures, such as the coal-fired power \nplant  program  to  displace  oil-based  generation,  as  well  as  with  improvements  in  PLN\u2019s \nefficiency, such as a reduction in the transmission and distribution losses from 11.5% in 2005 to \nbelow 10%. Once full cost recovery is achieved, the tariff issue should be depoliticized26 by \ndeveloping  a  rational  tariff-setting  mechanism  that  maintains  the  recovery,  and  delegating \nresponsibility  for  its  application  to  an  independent  regulatory  body.  In  the  interim,  the \nGovernment is willing to provide assurances for new independent power producer projects \nindicating that the Government will ensure that PLN can meet its PSOs. This would be a \ndeparture from the earlier open-ended practice of the Government commitment to ensure PLN \nmeets its power purchase agreement obligations. The IRSDP will support the development and \nimplementation of a fiscally sound system in this area. \n \n58.  When increasing electricity tariffs, the impact on the poor must be cushioned. The \ncurrent lifeline rate system27 may be too generous in its coverage as more than half of PLN\u2019s 33 \nmillion customers accounting for almost 30% of PLN\u2019s electricity sales benefit. The system, \nincluding  connection  fees,  should  be  reviewed  to  determine  whether  better  targeting  and \nprotection of the poor are necessary by narrowing customer groups benefiting and, at the same \ntime, reducing the lifeline rate. \n \n59.  Oil  and  Gas.  The  Government  has  given  high  priority  to  gradual  removal  of  fuel \nsubsidies, as they have posed a heavy burden on the budget,28 disproportionately benefited the \nmiddle class and the rich,29 and distorted the energy mix. Given the political sensitivity of this \nissue, the Government conducted a comprehensive socialization campaign and explained the \nrationale for, and unavoidability of, the gradual subsidy removal before increasing the domestic \nprices of oil products in February/March 2005 by an average of 49%.30 Despite the major price \nincreases, the subsequent unfavorable movement of world market prices widened the gap \nagain. MOF projections showed that the fuel subsidy would rise from the $8.2 billion allocated in \nthe revised 2005 budget (18% of the total government expenditure), to almost $15 billion (33%), \ncrowding out expenditures for social sectors and infrastructure. As this development was clearly \nunsustainable and negatively affected the rupiah, the Government took two bold actions. In \nJuly\u2013August 2005, prices for industrial users, accounting for 37% of total consumption, were \nbrought to international levels, and in October 2005 after intensive socialization efforts, prices of \nthe remaining oil products were raised by an average of 126%.31 To mitigate the social impact \n                                                 \n26  Government Regulation 3/2005 upholds the principle that electricity tariffs are set by the President of Indonesia \nbased on a recommendation of the minister of energy and mineral resources. \n27  The lifeline rate of about $0.018/kWh is applicable to small residential consumers with a capacity of less than 450 \nvolts-ampere, social institutions, small businesses, and small industries, for the first 30 kWh of their monthly \nconsumption. \n28  In the 2004 budget, i.e., before the sharp rise of international oil prices, fuel subsidies were almost equivalent to the \nallocation for education and health, and more than twice as high as the allocation for roads and irrigation. \n29  Only about 6% of Indonesian households have cars, and only a third have motorcycles. \n30  By 27% for automotive diesel oil, 33% for gasoline, 39% for industrial diesel oil, 44% for kerosene used by industry, \nand 104% for marine fuel oil. For social reasons, the price of kerosene used by households was kept unchanged. \n31  By 105% for automotive diesel oil, 88% for gasoline, and 186% for kerosene, bringing the prices of these products \nto 77%, 80%, and 33% of the then prevailing international levels. \n ", "21 \nof these unprecedented measures,32 the Government announced a major package of direct \nsubsidies to the poor.33 The Government also made clear its intention to complete the fuel \nsubsidy removal during 2006\u20132007 and let domestic oil prices follow international prices. \n \n60.  Given its large reserves, natural gas can play a much more important role domestically. \nThe recently issued Perpres 5/2006 on National Energy Policy stipulates a minimum share of \n30% for natural gas in Indonesia\u2019s energy mix by 2025, compared to less than 20% for oil. In \nresponse to the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling on oil and gas pricing, and the minimum gas \nallocation for the domestic market, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources drafted the \nnecessary amendments to the implementing regulations for Oil and Gas Law 22/2001, setting \nthe domestic market obligation for gas producers at 25%. Another impetus to the domestic use \nof gas will come from the new Energy Law, which aims to increase access to energy and ensure \nenergy security through diversification, conservation, and public participation. Investments in the \ncountry\u2019s large reserves of coal-bed methane have been limited due to lack of policy and legal \nclarity on extraction and sale or the resource. A policy and operational guidelines for coal-bed \nmethane exploration and production are needed. \n \n61.  The current dual role of regulator and contracting authority played by BPH Migas in the \ndownstream part of the sector may raise concerns among operators about its objectivity in \nresolving  contractual  disputes.  The  division  of  contracting  authority  for  the  upstream  and \ndownstream business between BP Migas and BPH Migas may lead to inconsistencies in the \nplanning and implementation of upstream and downstream projects. Consequently, current \narrangements  should  be  reviewed  in  the  medium  term,  with  a  view  to  creating  a  single \nregulatory body and a single contracting agency, and ensuring that the former has no links to \nthe  latter  and  is  fully  independent.  Apart  from  managing  tariffs  prescribed  by  contract  or \ndetermined by the market, the new regulatory body should take over some other regulatory \nfunctions currently exercised by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, such as issuing \nlicenses and setting service standards. \n \n62.  Telecommunications. This infrastructure sector is more advanced in terms of reforms \nthan other sectors. The two major enterprises with state ownership\u2014Telkom and Indosat\u2014are \nlisted  at  the  Jakarta  and  New  York  stock  exchanges,  the  Indonesian  Telecommunications \nRegulatory  Body34  is  operational  and  after  stakeholder  consultations,  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications and Informatics issued Regulation 8/2006 on interconnection providing for a \nmove from revenue sharing to a cost-based approach for tariff setting. Looking forward, the \nsector blueprint needs to be updated taking into account achievements in PSP, lessons, and \ntechnological advances. To move from the current duopoly to full competition and thereby \nencourage higher investments by the private sector, business opportunities need to be opened \nfor fixed-line long-distance and international connections. This will require the design of a new \nindustry structure and restructuring of the current licensing system. Finally, a PSO policy is \nneeded to help accelerate the expansion of fixed-line services, particularly in rural areas.35 \n \n63.  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  IRSDP  supports  the  formulation  of  policies  on \ncommunity  and  institution-based  provision  of  water  supply  and  environmental  sanitation \n                                                 \n32  A 12% oil price increase in 2000 was followed by a 30% increase in 2001 and a 22% increase in 2003. The 2003 \nincrease was partly rolled back by the previous administration because of public discontent. \n33  The package consists of quarterly payments of Rp300,000 to an estimated 15.6 million households with a monthly \nper capita income of less than Rp175,000. \n34  Chaired  by  the  director  general  of  post  and  telecommunications,  of  the  Ministry  of  Communications  and \nInformatics, the regulatory body has six other members, and is funded from the ministry\u2019s budget. Apart from being \ninvolved in this regulatory function, the Directorate General of Post and Telecommunications is in charge of policy \nmaking and business license issuance. \n35  The recent Government Regulation 28/2005 allows retaining 0.75% of revenues of telecommunication companies \nfor this purpose. \n   ", "22   \nservices to more effectively address access and quality issues in service delivery.36 The Water \nResources Law 7/2004 and the subsequent Government Regulation 16/2005 on Water Supply \nhave established a major part of the necessary legal framework by clarifying the terms for \nPSP,37 ending BUMD monopolies, eliminating the need for local parliament approval of water \ntariff increases, and calling for the establishment of the National Water Regulatory Agency \nunder MPW.38 Despite its name, the agency is basically an advisory rather than regulatory \nbody. Its  main responsibilities include helping formulate  sector policy and strategy, setting \noperational  standards  for  water  supply,  setting  and  evaluating  service  standards  and \nperformance of the regional water supply companies (PDAMs), and making recommendations \non involving cooperatives and the private sector in water supply. As water supply falls under the \nauthority of the fully decentralized district governments, the Government\u2019s vision is to strengthen \nthe role of the National Water Regulatory Agency. The institutional arrangements for regulation \nwill be reviewed and strengthened under SP2 and SP3, parallel to the issuance of the remaining \nimplementing regulations related to national water resources policy, national water resources \nboard, water resources management, water resources business, rivers and lakes, swamps, \ndams and reservoirs, groundwater, water quality management, and irrigation. \n \n64.  To ensure operational efficiency and financial viability of PDAMs, their commercialization \nand corporatization need to be pursued through enhanced management autonomy, technical \ncapacity  building,  cost-recovery  tariffs,  improved  revenue  collection,  better  financial \nmanagement and accounting, unaccounted-for-water reduction, stronger customer orientation, \nmergers of small nonviable PDAMs, and service coverage expansion. A system of transparent \nPSO subsidies targeting the poor in urban and rural areas is needed as part of expanding \nservice coverage. Given the high indebtedness of most PDAMs, financial restructuring through \nthe conversion of their long-term debt into government equity and offsetting receivables from \nlocal governments with repayments due to MOF is essential. The Government is preparing \nseveral restructuring programs comprising over 40 PDAMs.39 Under SP1, detailed appraisals \nhave been completed for five PDAMs, which will receive implementation support during SP2. If \nthe pilot program proves successful, the Government is committed to country-wide expansion.  \n \nc.  Model Public-Private Partnership Projects \n65.  At the IIS in January 2005, the Government offered 91 projects totaling $22.5 billion to \nthe private sector,40 but the expectations raised by this major offering have not yet been met. So \nfar prequalification and bidding have been undertaken for two batches of toll roads comprising a \ntotal of 17 projects, three gas pipeline projects, and one power project; prequalification is \nongoing for another six power projects. Participation in the bidding has been generally low. \n                                                 \n36  ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government has been guided by the framework developed in ADB. 2003. Asian \nWater Supplies. Manila. \n37  PSP can take the form of a cooperation agreement with the concerned regional water supply company or a license \ngranted by the concerned local government. \n38  Under ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for the Regulatory Framework for Private and \nPublic Water Supply and Wastewater Enterprises. Manila (TA 3761-INO), various regulatory framework options \nwere discussed extensively with central, local, and private stakeholders. In view of the decentralized structure, a \nconsensus emerged to set up a two-tier structure combining a national regulatory body and local regulatory \nfunctions, to be carried out by local regulators, thus recognizing both the primary role of local governments in the \nregulation of water services and the need for an overarching national regulatory framework to promote a consistent \napproach to transparent regulation throughout the country. \n39  The World Bank has supported the Government in assessing 13 PDAMs under the proposed Urban Water and \nSanitation Improvement and Expansion Project, and an additional 20 PDAMs through ongoing TA. ADB has \nevaluated 15 PDAMs in preparing for the proposed Water Supply and Sanitation Program. Given the complex \ndebt-restructuring arrangements, negotiations with local governments have proceeded slowly. \n40  This offering consisted of 38 toll-road projects ($9.4 billion), 12 power projects ($5.9 billion), 6 gas projects ($2.9 \nbillion), 1 telecommunications project ($1.6 billion), 4 port projects ($ 1.5 billion), 5 airport projects ($ 0.7 billion), 24 \nwater supply projects ($0.4 billion), and 1 railway project ($0.1 billion). \n ", "23 \nContracts have been awarded for the three gas pipelines and one power plant, as well as for \nthree toll roads, however the selected bidders have not arranged financing yet. Three primary \nreasons may explain the lack of bidders and inability to achieve more contract awards and \nfinancial closings. First, project preparation including (i) a thorough feasibility study with a risk \nanalysis, (ii) project packaging that is appropriate for execution on a PPP basis, and (iii) a \nbankable draft concession agreement, has been poor. Second, the Government did not indicate \nany support in the bidding documents, despite major risks perceived by investors with regard to \nland acquisition for toll-road projects and PLN\u2019s creditworthiness for power projects. Finally, \nbidding was hampered by the lack of strong central coordination. \n \n66.  With  the  recent  establishment  of  the  PSP  and  risk  management  frameworks  that \naddress these problems (Perpres 67/2005 and MOF Regulation 38/2006), the execution of PPP \nprojects is expected to accelerate. Demonstrating, through successful bidding and financial \nclosing for well-prepared model PPP projects, that the investment climate in Indonesia has \nsufficiently improved to execute such major transactions in line with international best practice is \nimportant. In particular, the execution of such transactions must not unduly favor SOEs or other \nconnected entities. As part of SP1, the Government has identified ten candidates for model PPP \nprojects  with  combined  estimated  investment  requirements  of  about  $4.5  billion  (Table  3). \nThese projects will go through all the necessary preparatory steps and transparent bidding \nprocesses stipulated in the PSP and risk management frameworks.  \n \n67.  Under SP2 and SP3, the process of project identification, screening, preparation, and \nbidding will be continuous. The bidding process is expected to be completed for the already \nselected model PPP projects, with the concession agreements signed and construction started. \nIn addition, the Government is expected to proceed with a significant number of additional PPP \nprojects. \n \nTable 3: Candidate Model Public-Private Partnership Projects \n \nProject  Key Features   Investment \n($ million) \nCentral Java Coal-Fired Power Plant   2X600 MW  1,200\nPasuruan Combined Cycle Plant  1X500 MW  275\nMedan\u2013Kuala Namu\u2013Tebing Tinggi Toll- 60 km  142\nRoad Project  \nSolo\u2013Kertosono Toll-Road Project   165 km  928\nMargagiri\u2013Ketapang Ferry Terminal  1.2 million passengers  97\nTeluk Lamong Seaport  350m berth container terminal  275\nThree Bulk Water Supply Projects  Bulk water distribution; and  107\n(Bandung, Dumai and Tanggerang)    water pipeline \nNational Telecommunications Backbone  30,000 km of fiber optic network  1,500\nProject \nTotal    4,524\nkm = kilometer; MW = Megawatt. \nSource: KKPPI. \n \n68.  Summary of Policy Actions. Appendix 4 presents a simplified summary of the key \nactions taken under the IRSDP.  \n \n  3.  Financing Plan \n69.  The IRSDP adopts a program cluster approach with three back-to-back subprograms, \neach covering about 21 months and supported by a single-tranche program loan. Thus, subject \nto approval of SP1 by the Board in October 2006, SP2 could be brought for the Board\u2019s \nconsideration in June 2008, and SP3 in March 2010. Based on the reform agenda that has \n   ", "24   \nevolved thus far, SP1 and SP2 have heavier reform content. The final agenda for SP3 will be \nfully developed during 2007\u20132009, by rebalancing outputs between SP2 and SP3 and taking \ninto account the emerging circumstances. In addition, investment loans or other support may be \nadded under the IRSDP to meet emerging needs. The PDF that is processed with SP1 is an \nexample. The Government strongly supports the program cluster approach, as it provides much \ngreater flexibility and facilitates medium-term planning. Since the approval of each subprogram \nis effectively embedded into the loan review process of the outcomes under the previous phase, \nthe  processing  and  financial  implications  do  not  differ  greatly  between  a  program  cluster \napproach  and  the  traditional  multitranche  program  loan  modality.  However,  the  inherent \nflexibility of the former will reduce the transaction costs both for the Borrower and ADB by \navoiding rigid policy conditions built into multitranche programs that frequently lead to delays \nbecause of political economy factors that are beyond the Government\u2019s control. \n  \n70.  For SP1, the Government has requested a loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to support the reforms outlined in the policy matrix and the development policy \nletter (Appendix 3). The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; conversion options that may \nbe exercised in accordance with the draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nconversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft program \nloan agreement. The Government has given ADB (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  this  choice  was  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance or any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n71.  The loan size was determined by the strength of the policy package, its development \nimpact, the importance of the sectors covered, and the adjustment costs arising due to the \nestablishment of various regulatory bodies and coordination mechanisms. The Government has \nset aside a total of Rp.5 trillion ($520 million) for risk sharing, equity contribution to a planned \ninfrastructure fund, and a revolving fund for land acquisition. In addition, the public sector \nportion of the planned PPP projects is estimated at about $2 billion in the short term. Thus, the \ndirect needs related to measures under SP1 alone are about $2.5 billion. Viewed over the \nprogram cluster period, there are major adjustment costs imposed by restructuring of SOEs to \nallow for greater access and opportunities for the private sector, and the significant PSOs for \npro-poor infrastructure. Essential initial steps are being taken and investments made now.  \n \n72.  Subject to approvals by their respective authorities, the Government of Japan and the \nWorld Bank may cofinance SP1 on the basis of the IRSDP policy matrix and the thrust of the \ndevelopment policy letter. In terms of its overall financing requirements in 2006, the Government \nhas sought $1.3 billion-$1.5 billion in program loans from ADB, Japan, and the World Bank.41 \nThis reflects a significantly higher fiscal deficit in 2006 (around 1.0% of GDP), due to increased \ndevelopment  spending  in  the  health,  education,  and  infrastructure  sectors,  as  well  as  the \nYogyakarta-Central Java reconstruction assistance. These needs can be accommodated only \npartly through the fuel subsidy reductions in 2005. The program lending support will assist the \nGovernment in meeting the reform-related costs as well as the overall financing requirements. \nThe macroeconomic assessment letter from the International Monetary Fund is in Appendix 6. \n \n                                                 \n41  This comprises (i) from ADB, $400 million for the IRSDP, $200 million through the Development Policy Support \nProgram II, and the $100 million planned second tranche release under Loans 2126/2127(SF)-INO: State Audit \nReform Sector Development Program; (ii) from the World Bank, $500 million\u2013$600 million through its Development \nPolicy Loan 3; and (iii) from the Government of Japan, $100 million\u2013$300 million through cofinancing of the \nDevelopment Policy Loans 2 and 3, and IRSDP.  \n ", "25 \n73.  In the context of the ongoing discussions about the new country strategy and program, \nthe Government has asked that ADB provide a loan of around $300 million\u2013$400 million for \neach of SP2 and SP3 based on the resource requirements.  \n \n  4.  Implementation Arrangements \n  a.  Program Management \n74.  BAPPENAS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  coordinating  the \nimplementation of the Program Cluster. The KKPPI, chaired by the coordinating minister for \neconomic affairs, will oversee the implementation of the Program Cluster, and provide guidance \nand direction to the line ministries in charge of the various infrastructure sectors, which will act \nas the implementing agencies. Implementation of the policy actions will be coordinated with \nseveral other agencies, including SOEs and BUMDs, in charge of infrastructure provision.  \n \n    b.  Implementation Period \n75.  The implementation period for SP1 is from 1 January 2005 to 30 September 2006. All \nactions included in the policy matrix under SP1 have been completed during this time frame.  \n \n  c.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n76.  The SP1 loan of $400 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness. The \nloan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and \ntaxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding the items specified \nin the negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program loan \nwill be disbursed to the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, if the \nvalue of Indonesia\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, \nand imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan disbursed during the given year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith this formula with its withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation under existing \nprocedures will be required. All goods and services produced and originating in ADB member \ncountries will be procured with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with \nthe Government\u2019s standard public procedures, and normal private sector commercial practices \nacceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the international commodity market will be \nprocured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \nd.  Anticorruption \n77.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy42 was explained to and discussed with the Government; and \nall relevant ADB guidelines, including the Procurement Guidelines (2006), Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants, and the Loan Regulations, were specifically brought to the notice of the \nGovernment. The Government has considerably strengthened its anticorruption efforts since \nlate 2004. Procurement reforms have been under way for some time, resulting in competitive \nand  relatively  transparent  selection  of  bidders  by  the  public  sector.  The  PSP  regulatory \nframework, adopted as part of the IRSDP, sets out clear guidelines for the selection of private \nsector sponsors. The KKPPI is tasked with ensuring that the bidding processes are fair and \ntransparent. Furthermore, the President of Indonesia has considerably enhanced the profile and \n                                                 \n42  ADB. 2006. Anticorruption.

These steps are already having an impact. \n \n   e.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n78.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  the  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment will open a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive the loan proceeds. The \naccount will be managed, operated, and liquidated on terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n  f.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation and Program Review \n79.  As the IRSDP covers nine sectors, close to 20 line ministries and agencies, and scores \nof SOEs and BUMDs, technical coordination and progress monitoring will be critical. The KKPPI \nis mandated to coordinate, leverage, and monitor reform progress within the broader context of \nthe Infrastructure Policy Package. The line ministries, as implementing agencies, will report on \nprogress to BAPPENAS through periodic meetings. With ADB TA support, the BAPPENAS part \nof the KKPPI Secretariat will strengthen the line ministry reporting system and provide technical \ncoordination to resolve problems and facilitate implementation of pending or delayed actions. In \nline with CMEA Regulation 1/2006, the CMEA part of the KKPPI Secretariat will host regular \nstakeholder  consultative  meetings  to  solicit  feedback  on  emerging  regulations  and  project  \nimplementation  from  the  private  sector  and  development  partner  community.  The  KKPPI \nSecretariat\u2019s monitoring outcomes will be reported to the principal development partners and \nother  stakeholders.  In  addition,  joint  quarterly  reviews  of  the  overall  Program  Cluster \nperformance  will  be  undertaken  by  BAPPENAS  and  ADB,  in  coordination  with  the  other \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n80.  BAPPENAS and ADB will jointly assess the impact and evaluate the benefits of SP1 \nwithin 12 months after it is completed. Findings from the consultations and reviews will be \nutilized in ensuring continuity and sustained progress of reforms under SP2 and SP3. As the \nIRSDP provides an overall umbrella framework for medium-term reforms, ADB will also solicit \nfeedback from a wide range of stakeholders and disseminate IRSDP implementation progress, \nwith the aim of promoting PSP in infrastructure provision. BAPPENAS will actively assist and \nsupport ongoing Program Cluster monitoring and evaluation including facilitating consultations \nwith central and provincial agencies, infrastructure sector participants, civil society, and other \nkey stakeholders as appropriate. \n \nD.  The Project Loan  \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n81.  The  project  loan  will  help  accelerate  PSP  in  Indonesia\u2019s  infrastructure  sectors  by \nsupporting establishment of the PDF. The PDF will alleviate one of the most critical constraints \nimpeding infrastructure development, namely, the lack of adequate project preparation. The \nPDF will help the Government (i) prepare feasibility studies for national and decentralized PPP \nprojects;  (ii)  adopt  open  and  transparent  bidding  processes;  and  (iii)  execute  project \ntransactions (Appendix 8). \n \n  2.  Components and Outputs \n82.  The Project has three components:  \n \n(i)  PPP project preparation and transaction execution to establish \n ", "27 \n \n(a)  a national component of the PDF to fund the preparation and bidding of \nlarge-scale  projects, mostly in power, toll-road, and transport sectors; \nand \n(b)  a regional component of the PDF to fund the preparation and bidding of \nsmaller-scale decentralized regional infrastructure projects;  \n \n(ii)  technical advisory services to the PDF and capacity building for PPP project \npromotion and execution; and \n \n(iii)  procurement and administrative services to the PDF. \n \n83.  The National Component of the PDF. This component will help accelerate large-scale \nPPP project transactions. In line with Perpres 67/2005, it will finance project preparation and \ntransaction execution, leading to the conclusion of an appropriate contractual arrangement for \nthe project (i.e., PPP procurement). Subsequent project implementation will not be financed \nfrom the national component of the PDF. Its scope will cover large national projects, with a \nspecific focus on preparing about 10 projects, concentrating mostly in power, toll-roads and \ntransport sectors. Given the relatively poor access to infrastructure services, particularly by the \npoor, the national component of the PDF will help the Government\u2019s poverty reduction efforts by \naccelerating the necessary investments and encouraging PSP, which in turn will have longer \nterm multiplier effects on poverty reduction. In addition, the national component of the PDF will \nalleviate acute capacity constraints within line ministries and contracting agencies in preparing \nprojects and selecting private sector partners. \n \n84.  The Regional Component of the PDF. This component will support local governments \nin preparing at least 40 decentralized regional infrastructure PPP projects that would increase \nPSP. The facility\u2019s impact will be improved regional living conditions and faster economic growth \nthrough  local  infrastructure  development.  Outcomes  include  (i)  increased  PSP  in  regional \ninfrastructure projects by enabling local governments to prepare bankable PPP projects, and (ii) \ndissemination  and  encouragement  of  best  practice  in  structuring  and  executing  PPP \ntransactions. The resulting projects will be ready for financing and implementation. They will \ngenerate business and employment opportunities for a wide range of private sector participants \nacross Indonesia.  \n \n85.  Technical Advisory Services. This component will provide technical advisory service \nsupport to a project management unit (PMU) to be established in BAPPENAS to administer the \nPDF. Support for the PMU includes (i) refinement of selection criteria for providing PDF funding; \n(ii)  assessment  of  requests  for  such  funding;  (iii)  technical  evaluation  of  proposals  from \nconsultants to be recruited for PPP project preparation and transaction execution; (iv) linking \nPPP venture proponents with financial institutions capable of funding the proposed projects; (v) \nadvisory support to the KKPPI on cross-cutting policy or regulatory measures in the areas of \nanticorruption,  transparency,  and  dispute  resolution  that  would  elicit  greater  PSP;  and  (vi) \noverall PPP project promotion. \n \n2.  Important Features \n \n86.  The KKPPI, as coordinator of the overall infrastructure development process, will provide \noversight  of  the  PDF  through  BAPPENAS.  The  intrasectoral  prioritization  of  projects  and \nsubmission  of  requests  for  PDF  funding  will  be  done  by  the  concerned  line  ministries  or \ncontracting agencies at the national level, and local governments and related agencies at the \ndecentralized level. The PMU will adopt clear and transparent criteria to screen requests and \nmake recommendations for approval (Appendix 8).  \n   ", "28   \n3.  Financing Plan \n \n87.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $38.8 million (Table 4). The Government has \nrequested  a  loan  of  $26.5  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The \nGovernment of the Netherlands has advised that its formal commitment to provide $7.6 million \nin grant cofinancing may be expected immediately after ADB Board consideration. To expedite \nproject  implementation,  Board  approval  to  administer  this  proposed  grant  is  sought.  The \nGovernment of Indonesia will allocate staff and other resources for the equivalent of $4.7 \nmillion. Table 5 presents the financing plan.  \n \n88.  The provision of funding from the Asian Development Fund is justified by (i) Indonesia\u2019s \nlow infrastructure service coverage ratios compared to other countries in the region, resulting \nparticularly in the poor not having access to basic infrastructure services; (ii) the need to support \nongoing efforts to systematically rebuild national and local government capacity eroded after the \nAsian financial crisis; and (iii) Indonesia\u2019s relatively high debt-to-GDP ratio of 45%, and the \nGovernment\u2019s preference for borrowing on concessional terms for capacity building. \n \nTable 4: Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \nComponent and Description  Amount   %\nA.

Implementation Arrangements  \n89.  Project  Management. BAPPENAS  will  be  the  Executing Agency.  The  head  of  the \nDirectorate for Public-Private Partnerships in BAPPENAS will oversee the PMU and the PDF. \nThe PMU will coordinate all three project components. PMU staff will be supported by the \ninternational and national consultants to be recruited under the technical advisory services and \ncapacity building, and procurement and administrative services components. To ensure full \nadherence to the PPP legal and regulatory framework, the PMU will work closely with the \ncentral PPP unit to be established under the Directorate for Public-Private Partnerships. A \nProject Steering Committee as outlined in para. 20 of Appendix 8 will be established to serve as \nhigh-level decision-making and guiding forum for the PDF. The approval authority for funding \nrequests will be different for the national and regional components of the PDF (Appendix 8, \nFigure 3).   \n \n90.  Implementation Period. Project implementation is expected to start in the first quarter \nof 2007. The first component is expected to be committed within 4 years. Thereafter, the PDF \nmay operate as a revolving facility, using the reflow of funds from the first batch of projects if \nadequate  cost-recovery  arrangements  result  from  the  study  conducted  under  the  second \ncomponent. The capacity-building and advisory services under the second component will be \nimplemented  over  5  years.  The  procurement  and  administrative  services  under  the  third \ncomponent will also be implemented over 5 years.  \n \n91.  Procurement Arrangements: The PMU will coordinate all procurement arrangements. \nAbout  552  person-months  of  international  consulting  inputs  and  3,401  person-months  of \nnational consulting services are expected to be needed to support PDF implementation. The \nservices required under the second and third component will be procured by the PMU soon after \nloan effectiveness. The consulting packages under the first component will be procured on a \nneeds basis, depending on the readiness of the concerned PPP projects. The procurement of \ngoods such as computer equipment and office supplies, predominantly under the second and \nthird component, will be through shopping or national competitive bidding as appropriate. \n \n92.  Safeguard  Considerations.  The  PDF  will  not  finance  any  investments  in  project \nimplementation,  as  they  will  support  only  the  preparation  of  feasibility  studies  and  PPP \nprocurement  up  to  the  signing  of  the  concession  agreement  (or  other  contractual \narrangements). Requests for any subsequent ADB financing for project investments will be dealt \nwith separately, and will be subject to all of ADB\u2019s requirements, particularly with regard to \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards.  As  ADB  financing  is  not  assumed  at  the  project \npreparation stage, the PDF will not be able to enforce ADB\u2019s detailed safeguard policies. \nHowever, the principles of these policies will be applied. Environmental and social impact \nassessment,  including  issues  of  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples,  will  be \nintegral  components  in  the  preparation  of  PPP  projects  to  be  supported  by  the  PDF.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure acceptable to ADB will be developed before \nfinancing any feasibility studies. \n \nIV.  Technical Assistance \n \n93.  In December 2005 (footnote 15) ADB approved TA to support the BAPPENAS part of \nthe KKPPI Secretariat in (i) enhancing its technical capacity, (ii) developing an overall PSO \nframework, (iii) developing a harmonized regulatory framework for the various infrastructure \nsectors, and (iv) screening and preparing projects. Subsequently, the Government has asked \nADB for TA to implement the risk management framework adopted by MOF as part of the \nIRSDP,  and  design  institutional  arrangements  for  the  various  infrastructure  financing \n   ", "30   \nmechanisms  currently  under  consideration  that  ensure  sound  fiduciary  governance  in  the \nprovision of Government support for PPP projects. \n  \n94.  The proposed TA for Enhancing PSP in Infrastructure Provision will focus on  \n \n(i)  effective implementation of the risk-management framework, leading to greater \nPSP; \n(ii)  capacity building for establishing and managing the various infrastructure funds;  \n(iii)  effective communication and social marketing of the reform agenda to a wide \nrange of stakeholders; and \n(iv)  start up activities and documentation needed to support preliminary technical \npreparations prior to the consideration of projects by the PDF.   \n \n95.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,500,000. ADB will finance $2,000,000 from its \nTA funding program, and the Government will provide counterpart support in the equivalent of \n$500,000. Appendix 9 presents details on the TA. \n  \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n96.  The key benefits expected from the IRSDP are \n \n(i)  sustained progress in meeting the Government\u2019s medium-term economic growth \nobjectives, as articulated in the RPJM for 2006\u20132009; \n(ii)  improvements in the investment climate, to be demonstrated by sound policy, \nlegal, and institutional frameworks in the infrastructure sectors; \n(iii)  greater potential for PSP, and a more systematic approach for implementing PPP \ntransactions; \n(iv)  preparation and implementation of quality infrastructure projects in a transparent \nand  expedient  manner,  resulting  in  (a)  improved  availability  and  quality  of \ninfrastructure  services;  (b)  a  boost  to  Indonesia\u2019s  competitiveness  versus  its \nregional neighbors; and (c) lower poverty incidence, through direct as well as \nindirect transmission channels; \n(v)  sustained engagement by ADB in the policy dialogue with the Government on the \ndirection  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic,  structural,  and \ninstitutional reform agenda in the broader area of investment climate; the IRSDP \nwill provide for policy continuity and consistency in areas where ADB has been \nactively involved; and \n(vi)  aid harmonization and parallel financing by the key development partners (ADB, \nGovernment of Japan, and World Bank) around a common policy framework and \ndialogue, and the positive externalities resulting from such a joint endorsement of \nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda. \n \n97.  Institutional. The IRSDP will strengthen the key institutions dealing with infrastructure \ndevelopment  in  Indonesia.  At  the  national  level,  the  KKPPI,  its  secretariat  and  the  Risk \nManagement Unit in MOF are expected to evolve into strong institutions coordinating central \nsupport for infrastructure development through greater PSP. Within each infrastructure sector, \nthe regulatory bodies will be strengthened over the medium term by making them independent, \nclarifying their mandate, and providing adequate resources for their operations. The role of \nSOEs will be redefined during IRSDP implementation. This will enhance their competitiveness \nto effectively work in an environment with much greater PSP. Overall, the capacity to prepare \nand execute bankable projects will be considerably enhanced. Supported by the planned long-\n ", "31 \nterm  infrastructure  financing  mechanisms,  the  country\u2019s  financial  institutions  will  be \nstrengthened. The roles and responsibilities of local governments as well as BUMDs will be \nclarified. \n  \n98.  Social. The IRSDP\u2019s main contribution is to improve the investment climate, and thereby \ncontribute directly to poverty reduction, through greater access to markets, and economic and \nemployment opportunities, among others. The adjustments in oil prices have already reduced \nwasteful spending considerably. The Government has utilized the additional fiscal space for \nmore pro-poor spending. The Government will review tariff policies in all sectors and adopt tariff \nregimes that are in line with cost-recovery principles. At the same time, the impact of tariff \nincreases on the poor will be mitigated through appropriate measures, and the PSO framework \nwill be strengthened to effectively deliver essential infrastructure services. The adoption of \ntransparent, market-based and competitive pricing will promote PSP, which in turn will lead to \ngreater  tax  and  non-tax  revenues,  and  additional  employment  opportunities.  The  lessons \nlearned from the post-fuel-subsidy program will be incorporated by the Government in designing \nappropriate PSO mechanisms. The Government is aware of the possible negative impact of \nexpedient approaches to land acquisition. The recently adopted Perpres 36/2005 as amended \nby Perpres 65/2006 (paras.23 and 46) attempts to bring the Government\u2019s legal framework on \nland acquisition and involuntary resettlement closer to ADB\u2019s policies. If the ongoing dialogue \naimed at strengthening the draft implementing regulations for Perpres 36/2005 and 65/2005 is \nsuccessful, the Government\u2019s legal framework will be more aligned with ADB\u2019s requirements. \nThe Government is also considering alternative approaches to provide speedy compensation \nand enhance administrative accountability through open and transparent dispute resolution \nmechanisms. Overall, the IRSDP is likely to lead to significant social benefits. Appendix 10 \npresents a summary poverty reduction and social impact analysis. \n \n99.  Economic. The nature of the IRSDP\u2014a policy reform program\u2014does not lend itself to a \nquantitative financial and economic analysis. Nevertheless, major general economic benefits will \naccrue to the entire Indonesian population through the IRSDP through the expanded scope and \nimproved quality of infrastructure services. The rigorous project preparation, screening, bidding, \nand contracting processes will enhance the direct and indirect economic impacts of project \ntransactions. Through its secretariat, the KKPPI will review the financial and economic analyses \nfor all proposed PPP projects. The IRSDP will provide support to the KKPPI Secretariat in this \nregard, and ensure that sound assessments are carried out and the economic benefits are \nhighlighted. Board documents for SP2 and SP3 will present updates on such assessments.   \n \n100.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environment. Perpres 36/2005 and Perpres \n65/2006 recognize traditional communal land ownership (Hak Ulayat) and usufruct rights.43 In \nline with the regulatory provisions, the rights of indigenous peoples will be upheld in the case of \nany  land  acquisition  involving  them.  These  provisions  are  in  conformity  with  requirements \noutlined  in  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  indigenous  peoples.44  ADB  is  preparing  an  advisory  TA  to \nstrengthen  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  for  social  assessment  and  resettlement  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring; and if necessary, to assist in strengthening the legal framework \nif the implementing regulations for Perpres 36/2005 and Perpres 65/2006 are found to be \ninadequate. Based on a desk review, the IRSDP measures are unlikely to have any adverse \nenvironmental impacts. Further, while the IRSDP facilitates the preparation and bidding of \nseveral  model  PPP  projects,  it  will  not  provide  any  investment  support  to  such  projects. \nNonetheless, the Government, through the KKPPI, will ensure that all social and environmental \nsafeguards are complied with in line with the prevailing laws and regulations. Any projects to \n                                                 \n43  Subject to the caveat in para. 98 that appropriate implementing regulations would ensure a complete alignment \nbetween what is outlined in these perpreses and ADB policies.  \n44  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila. \n   ", "32   \nreceive ADB financing must comply with all of ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguards \nrequirements. \n  \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n101.  Coordination Problems and Conflict of Interest. Progress of infrastructure reforms \nhas been impeded by poor coordination, and competing and conflicting interests of various \nstakeholders. In particular, political economy considerations and the lack of coordination and of \na  coherent  vision  to  guide  infrastructure  development  prevented  sector  liberalization  and \nrestructuring of key institutions in the past. Over 2005\u20132006, the Government, at the highest \nlevels, has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to pursue the medium-term reforms to promote \nPSP. While full and effective coordination and reforms in certain sectors may take time to evolve \nand will need significant consensus building, the essential steps taken thus far will have a \ndemonstrational effect in supporting infrastructure development in a coordinated manner.  \n \n102.  Poor Governance and Corruption. With the high stakes involved in large infrastructure \nprojects in several sectors, the IRSDP may face significant impediments in the form of weak \ngovernance, collusion, and corruption. In particular, despite the commendable rigid stance taken \nby MOF, risks of misallocation of scarce public resources could still be encountered, leading to \npublic support for directly negotiated projects or projects that do not meet all relevant criteria for \nsuch  support  during  the  transition  period.  Problems  of  a  similar  nature  have  not  been \nuncommon in the past in Indonesia. However, the Government has put in place a sound legal \nframework and a good mechanism of checks and balances. Equally important is the much \ngreater degree of transparency and public debate even on such sensitive issues, which in turn \noffers a natural firewall around the use of budget resources and ensures compliance with due \nprocesses. Further, the Government has considerably strengthened its anticorruption efforts \nover the last year.  \n \n103.  Social Tensions. Tariff reforms are sensitive in any environment, and Indonesia is no \nexception. As the country gradually moves away from the current system of administered prices \nfor infrastructure services, social tensions will be inevitable. However, the savings from the \nreduction in inefficient subsidies will enable the Government to reorient its public expenditures \ntoward poverty reduction, employment generation, and rural infrastructure development. \n \n104.  Adverse Economic Developments. Domestic macroeconomic volatility or the lack of \nsustained momentum on policy reforms, or adverse regional events that have a contagion effect \non the Indonesian economy, would impede PSP. Over the last 3\u20134 years, the Indonesian \neconomy has been quite resilient to domestic and external shocks. The Government recognizes \nand has addressed investors\u2019 concerns about policy reforms.  \n \n105.  Sectarian and Regional Conflicts, and Security Concerns. The Government and law \nenforcement authorities have taken a range of effective measures to resolve such conflicts, \nwhich could slow private investments, and to rebuild public and investor confidence.  \n  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n106.  In  addition  to  the  standards  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program loan will be used \nto finance the development needs as outlined under the IRSDP implementation \narrangements. \n ", "33 \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the date of the IRSDP loan agreement, as \ndescribed in the letter of development policy (including the policy matrix), will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of the IRSDP and subsequently. \n(iii)  The  Government  shall  cause  the  line  ministries,  contracting  agencies,  and \nregional governments to ensure that the projects financed by the PDF will be \ndesigned and implemented in strict conformity with the applicable national laws, \nregulations, and policies; competitive and transparent processes; and all relevant \nenvironmental and social safeguard standards; and that the environmental and \nsocial  assessments  are  carried  out  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures, \nincluding monitoring, are prepared and implemented. \n(iv)  The studies and technical designs prepared for the projects and other consulting \nservices  provided  will  broadly  comply  with  all  relevant  ADB  requirements, \npolicies, and guidelines. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that all necessary counterpart funds for project \nimplementation are provided fully and in a timely manner. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n107.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n(i)  the program cluster for the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \nto the Republic of Indonesia;  \n \n(ii)  the loan of $400,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 1 of the \nInfrastructure Reform Sector Development Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, with  interest  to  be  determined  in accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Program Loan Agreement presented to the Board;

Investment Requirements  \n \n1.  This  appendix  discusses  specific  issues  and  constraints  faced  in  the  various \ninfrastructure sectors in Indonesia, with a summary provided in Table A2. Figure A2 illustrates \nthe  magnitude  of  the  investment  needs  by  sector,1  with  the  outer  circle  indicating  total \nrequirements and the inner circle those that can be met by the public sector. The circles are \npositioned against each sector\u2019s potential for private sector participation (PSP) on the vertical \naxis2 and the gap between each sector\u2019s service coverage and the regional average on the \nhorizontal axis.3 In terms of unmet investment requirements, the power sector is leading, closely \nfollowed by urban services4 and roads. In terms of PSP potential, the gas sector is a front-\nrunner, with the other sectors clustered below the middle line. \n \nFigure A2: Gaps in Infrastructure Provision in Indonesia \n \n \n  Infrastructure Investment Needs Versus  \nService Coverage and Private Sector Potential \nPrivatization  High \nEquity \nInvestment  al  Gas\nti\nn\nBuilt-Operate-  e Scale: $5 Billion \nt\nTransfer  Po\nr  Power\nConcession  o\nt\nc\ne\nS\nManagement   e  Ports Airports Urban \nt\nContract  a\nv\nConstruction  PriLow Rail  Roads\n50.0  40.0  30.0  20.0  10.0  0.0 \nService Coverage (% below the regional average) \nSource: ADB staff, based on Government data.\n \n \nB.  Roads \n \n2.  Since roads account for the major share of domestic freight and interurban passenger \nland travel in Indonesia, their coverage and condition are crucial to supporting economic growth \nand social development. Yet the road density, at 0.19 kilometers (km) per square km or 1.7 km \nper 1,000 people, is among the lowest in Southeast Asia. While investments in road network \nupgrading  and  expansion  were  substantial  in  the  1980s  and  1990s,  sector  expenditures \ndecreased sharply after the Asian financial crisis, from a peak of around 22% of the overall \npublic budget in the mid-1990s to about 10% in recent years. National arterial roads are in a \nrelatively good condition, but almost half are congested, increasing costs for industry and trade, \nand the network comprises only about 600 km of high-grade toll roads. Provincial roads are \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n2  For example, the position of the power sector reflects the mix of a relatively high potential for PSP through build-\noperate-transfer projects in generation and a low PSP potential for construction in transmission and distribution. \n3  The regional average is based on data from the People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. For example, with an electrification ratio of 57%, Indonesia\u2019s power sector is 33 \npercentage points below the regional average of 85%.  \n4  Urban services include water supply and sanitation, solid waste management, and urban transport. \n   ", "38  Appendix 2 \ngenerally well preserved, but district and urban roads are in poor condition, with about 30% \nunpaved, thus restricting all-season access. In terms of spending, national arterial roads have \nbeen  fairly  well  preserved,  but  the  backlog  of  investments  in  network  improvement  and \nextension is growing. The regional situation is reversed, with underspending on preservation \nleading to greater strains than underspending in road development. Overall, of the estimated \nminimum annual funding requirements of Rp31 trillion ($3.3 billion), only Rp12 billion ($1.3 \nbillion) is currently met. This underlines the need for additional domestic and foreign financial \nresources.  \n \n3.  The current vehicle acquisition and ownership taxes, and fuel and other operational \ntaxes would cover about 70% of the necessary road maintenance costs. However, proceeds \nfrom vehicle revenues are treated as general tax revenues of the regional governments and not \ndesignated for road preservation. The potential for financing the maintenance of road assets on \na self-sustained basis is thus not utilized. Until recently, taxes imposed on road users were \ndwarfed by subsidies received in the form of low domestic prices of motor fuels. The gradual \nremoval of fuel subsidies needs to continue, with a portion of the savings redirected to road \ndevelopment. While road preservation can be fully financed domestically through restructured \nroad user charges, additional funds need to be mobilized for road development from the private \nsector and foreign borrowings. The private sector can be engaged in constructing and operating \nabout 1,500 km of high-grade toll roads to provide a complete trans-Java link and major parts of \nthe  trans-Sumatra  link,  while  foreign  borrowings  may  be  used  in  an  efficient  manner  for \nimproving and extending the national arterial road network, rather than for road preservation. \n \nC.  Ports and Airports \n \n4.  Ports and airports are of vital importance to regional cooperation and integration for \nIndonesia, an archipelago. In particular, the maritime sector comprising ports and shipping is a \nkey mode for domestic and international trade and passenger travel.5 Sea cargo traffic was only \nslightly affected by the Asian financial crisis, and is projected to grow at 6% per annum for \ninternational cargo and 4% per annum for domestic cargo. By contrast, sea passenger traffic did \nshow some decline after the crisis that is expected to continue in the next few years before slow \ngrowth at 2% per annum is resumed. \n \n5.  Deficiencies in basic infrastructure and handling equipment include draft restrictions in \nsome of the strategic ports that inhibit their ability to receive large vessels and fully participate in \nregional trade. Inadequate equipment is the main cause of generally low port productivity in \nterms of average berth occupancy rate, turnaround time, and containerization rate. Overall, \noperational  performance  and  service  provision  have  not  met  client  expectations  and \ninternational performance standards. In particular, performance in container terminal operations \nis considered unsatisfactory by port users. Port tariffs are low, allowing full cost recovery only in \nlarger ports. With the introduction of the International Ship and Port Security Code in July 2004, \nall Indonesian international ports face the challenge of implementing strict security measures; \nreceiving ports can reject docking of ships with cargo from ports that do not meet the code \nrequirements. \n \n6.  Air transport also plays a vital role for passengers, and high-value cargo and mail by \nfacilitating mobility, generating economic activity, and providing lifeline access to remote areas, \n                                                 \n5  In 2003, about 600 million tons of cargo and 10 million passengers were accommodated by 725 public and 1,478 \nprivate ports, of which 141 were classified as international ports. Twenty-five public ports designated by the \nGovernment as strategic ports providing the main gateway for passengers and cargo handle most of the container \ntraffic. \n ", "Appendix 2  39 \nthus helping integrate the islands across the country.6 The civil aviation industry suffered from \nfinancial losses after the Asian financial crisis, but has bounced back and is now carrying about \n60% more traffic than before the crisis. This is attributable to lower airfares as a result of \ncompetition in air transport and increasing geographic coverage of air transport services. Long-\nterm  projections  indicate  annual  growth  of  5%  for  domestic  passenger  traffic  and  6%  for \ninternational passenger traffic. \n \n7.  While the capacity of the airside facilities is sufficient in the main airports, terminals and \naprons are sometimes inadequate. The same is true for many secondary and tertiary airports. \nAir traffic security also needs to be addressed. Domestic airport tariffs are kept artificially low \nand do not allow cost recovery for services provided to passengers and air carriers. As a result, \nonly major airports with significant international traffic are able to break even in their operations. \nThe initiative for proposing increases in airport tariffs lies with the airport operator. However, the \noperator is required to consult with users, local governments, and the Ministry of Transportation \n(MOT). Experience with tariff increases indicates that they are difficult to implement due to \nstrong resistance usually expressed during the consultation process. As with ports, security of \nstrategic airports needs to be enhanced to deal effectively with security concerns. \n \n8.  The  current  legal  framework7  defines  the  various  categories  of  ports  and  airports; \nspecifies that management of all general ports and all airports is the responsibility of the \nGovernment, which can delegate it to a state-owned enterprise (SOE); and allows PSP only \nthrough a cooperation agreement with an SOE. Based on this framework, the Government \nidentified groups of ports and airports that are considered commercial (i.e., generate operating \nprofits or have the potential to do so), and allocated their management and development to six \nSOEs: (i) 111 ports to four Indonesian port corporations (PELINDO I to IV), and (ii) 23 airports to \ntwo airport corporations (Angkasa Pura I and II). In reality these portfolios contain a mix of \nprofitable  and  unprofitable  assets,  arranged  in  geographic  proximity,  and  with  positive \naggregate results. The SOEs exercise monopoly rights over the ports and airports in their \nportfolios, managing  all  aspects  of  operation,  development,  and  PSP.  They  also  act  as  a \nregulator  in  their  domain,  setting  tariffs  for  the  use  of  port/airport  infrastructure  and  for \nport/airport services in consultation with MOT. MOT, or Angkasa Pura I or II provide air traffic \nservices, depending on the airport. This fragmented approach presents coordination and safety \nproblems. \n \n9.  Both ports and airports have good potential for PSP, but actual PSP is low given the lack \nof a clear and predictable regulatory and investment environment, and the lack of a level playing \nfield providing equal access and opportunities to all investors. In the port sector, three of the \nfour PELINDOs have formed joint ventures with private operators. These deal structures, with \nthe PELINDOs acting as both landlord8 and operator, deter further PSP, as potential investors \nin new port terminals will not expect fair treatment from a landlord with a financial stake in an \nexisting operator. PSP in the airport sector has been very limited, and generally taken the form \nof  subcontracts  for  selected  landside  services.  Another  impediment  to  PSP  has  been \nuncertainty caused by regional autonomy legislation, which confers authority over public works, \n                                                 \n6 In 2003, aircraft movements in Indonesia\u2019s 186 airports, 24 of them international, totaled about 500,000, and air \ntraffic passengers\u2014departures and arrivals\u2014about 22 million. Three airports\u2014Soekarno-Hatta in Jakarta, Ngurah \nRai in Denpasar, and Juanda in Surabaya\u2014accounted for more than 60% of the passenger traffic. \n7 Maritime Law 21/1992, Government Regulation 69/2001, and the implementing ministerial decrees 53, 54, 55, and \n56/2002 for ports; and Aviation Law 15/1992, Government Regulation 70/2001, and the implementing ministerial \ndecrees 44,45, and 48/2002 for airports. \n8 Landlord functions in ports and airports include berth/terminal assignment, allocation of shed and warehouse space, \ncontrol of all vehicles that enter and leave the ports/airports, cleaning and maintenance of infrastructure, and \ncollection of fees. \n   ", "40  Appendix 2 \nincluding ports and airports, to local governments.9 This has created a potential for conflict with \nthe PELINDOs and Angkasa Puras. \n \nD.  Railways \n \n10.  The railway sector is very small in international terms and relative to Indonesia\u2019s size \nand population. It accounts for less than 10% of the country\u2019s total passenger traffic and less \nthan 1% of its total freight traffic. Railway operations are limited to predominantly passenger \nservices in Java and three separate networks in Sumatra that carry mainly cargo such as coal \nand cement. The total rail length is less than 6,000 km, mainly single-track route-km, of which \nabout one quarter is in a nonoperating condition. Most railway assets are old and deteriorating \n(e.g., over two thirds of serviceable rolling stock is more than 20 years old). Despite that, the \naverage utilization of labor and infrastructure is higher than in Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam.  \n \n11.  Based  on  Law  13/1992  on  Railways  and  the  related  implementing  regulations,  in \nparticular  the  Government  Regulation  69/1998  on  Train  Traffic  and  Transportation,  the \nGovernment  through  MOT  is  responsible  for  sector  policy  and  planning,  regulation,  and \nprovision of basic infrastructure such as rail tracks and signaling, while the fully state-owned \nIndonesia  Railway  Corporation  (KAI)  is  responsible  for  operating  and  maintaining  the \ninfrastructure, and providing all rail transport services. PSP is allowed through a cooperation \nagreement  with  KAI,  but  none  has  materialized  so  far.  Since  2000,  KAI  has  experienced \ndeclining and then stagnating demand due to low competitiveness of rail vis-\u00e0-vis road, air, and \nferry  services;  however  it  reports  small  profits.  Its  real  profitability  is  obscured  by  poorly \nimplemented funding arrangements, as KAI operates within a complex web of subsidies, public \nservice obligation arrangements, contracts with other SOEs, and caps on its economy-class \npassenger fares. \n \nE.  Power \n \n12.  Although the state-owned monopoly State Electricity Corporation (PLN) connected about \n32 million new customers to its system between 1974 and 2004 (i.e., an average of almost 1 \nmillion per year), the electrification ratio of 57% is still low by regional standards.10 About 90 \nmillion people lack access to electricity, and about two thirds of them live outside of Java and \nBali where the cost of power supply is substantially higher. Because of the universal tariff \nstructure  prevailing  in  Indonesia,  PLN  is  losing  money  with  every  residential  customer  it \nconnects outside the Java-Bali grid.11 Given the potentially huge number of such consumers, \nthere are limits to cross-subsidization by other consumer categories. Rural electrification thus \nruns counter to PLN\u2019s obligation as an SOE to make a profit.12 The implication is that the \nGovernment\u2019s ambitious target of providing electricity to 90% of the population by 2020 will be \ndifficult to achieve with the business-as-usual approach.13 A new rural electrification strategy \nneeds to be developed and implemented, based on innovative decentralized models for design, \n                                                 \n9  Law  on  Regional  Autonomy  22/1999,  Government  Regulation  25/2000,  and  the  revised  Law  on  Regional \nAutonomy  32/2004.  Government  regulations  69  and  70/2001  issued  to  clarify  the  responsibilities  of  local \ngovernments, PELINDOs, and Angkasa Puras have not achieved the desired result. \n10  The electrification ratio may be underestimated. Other estimates indicate 67%, but even that is significantly below \nthe regional average. \n11  Most of the off-grid regions are supplied by diesel power plants at a cost of more than Rp2,000/kilowatt-hour (kWh) \nand are dominated by small residential consumers charged less than Rp600/kWh. \n12  Law on State-Owned Enterprises 19/2003. \n13  The average annual growth rate in the number of PLN customers of 11.1% during the past 30 years has been \nimpressive. However, two different patterns of growth occurred: 15.3% per year before the financial crisis, 1974\u2013\n1997, and 6.4% thereafter. The sharply lower postcrisis growth is attributable to investment financing constraints \nand PLN\u2019s profit-making obligation. \n ", "Appendix 2  41 \nfinancing, implementation, and operation. Local development utilities, either in the form of a \ncooperative or a partnership between a local government-owned enterprise (BUMD) and a \nprivate service provider, provide a promising approach that can be best pursued through a \ncombination of centralized planning and coordination, and decentralized implementation. \n \n13.  PLN\u2019s current installed capacity of about 21,800 megawatts (MW) and the capacity of \nabout 3,400 MW contracted from independent power producers are insufficient to meet peak \ndemand outside the main grid of Java-Bali and leave an inadequate margin within it. The \noperation of the many captive, mostly diesel, power plants14 has become too costly following \nremoval of the fuel subsidy. Power demand is projected to grow at an annual rate of 6.6% \nthrough  2013.15  To  meet  the  forecast  demand,  1,000\u20132,000  MW  of  additional  generating \ncapacity needs to be commissioned annually. PLN has a sound generation expansion program, \nconsisting of five projects totaling 2,930 MW that will be commissioned during 2006\u2013200716 and \neight projects totaling 3,670 MW that are being put up for bidding in a staged manner.17 The fact \nthat all these projects except Cilegon and Musi are to be executed on an independent power \nproducer basis underlines the importance of a supportive environment for private investors. In \naddition to these capacity additions for meeting the growing demand, the Government has \nembarked on a program to install within three years another 10,000 MW of coal-fired capacity \nthrough an export-credit financed crash program to displace existing high-cost oil-based power \nplants that are the primary cause of PLN\u2019s sharply deteriorated financial position.  \n \n14.  The Electricity Law 20/2002 provides a progressive long-term vision for power sector \nrestructuring by unbundling PLN, independent regulation, competition, and PSP. However, in \nDecember 2004, the Constitutional Court annulled this law on the grounds that its provisions for \nunbundling and competition violated the 1945 Constitution. The annulment was based on the \ninterpretation  of  the  constitutional  requirement  for  state  control  of  important  branches  of \nproduction, with the Government and SOEs acting as owners and managers. The annulment \nhas  been  a  serious  setback  for  power  sector  reforms,  with  potentially  far-reaching \nconsequences for sector efficiency and financial sustainability, as well as investor confidence. A \nnew draft electricity law is undergoing a second round of deliberations in Parliament. Some \nmembers  of  Parliament,  Ministry  of  SOEs,  and  key  stakeholders  (e.g.,  industry  and  trade \nassociations, community groups, and academicians) have recommended that PLN be split into \ntwo entities and that its monopoly rights are revoked. The generally held view is that the new \nlaw should allow for more participation from regional governments (e.g., by creating municipal \nutilities), private sector, and community associations. \n \n15.  Through a series of electricity tariff increases,18 renegotiation of independent power \nproducer contracts,19 loan restructuring, government subsidies,20 and efficiency improvements, \n                                                 \n14  Approximately 10,000 companies maintain their own sources of power, mostly to mitigate the risks of grid supply \noutages. The combined installed capacity of these captive power plants is estimated at 13,000\u201315,000 MW, or \nroughly half of PLN\u2019s total capacity.  \n15  Directorate General of Electricity and Energy Utilization. 2004. National Electricity Master Plan 2004. Jakarta. \nPLN\u2019s power development plan for 2006\u20132015 is based on demand growth of 8.5% per annum.  \n16  Cilacap in Central Java (600 MW, coal); Cilegon in West Java (740 MW, natural gas, implemented by PLN with \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation financing); Tanjung Jati B in Central Java (1,320 MW, coal); Patuha in \nCentral Java (60 MW, geothermal), and Musi in Sumatra (210 MW, hydropower, implemented by PLN with Asian \nDevelopment Bank financing). \n17  Cirebon in West Java (600 MW, coal, bidding underway); Central Java (1,200 MW, coal); Pasuruan in East Java \n(500 MW, natural gas); Paiton 3 and 4 in East Java (800 MW, coal); Bali (200 MW, coal); Sibolga in North Sumatra \n(200 MW, coal); Amurang in North Sulawesi (50 MW, coal); and East Kalimantan (120 MW, natural gas). \n18  The average electricity tariff was increased by 29% in April 2000, 17% in July/October 2001, and through quarterly \nadjustments of 6% during 2002\u20132003. These increases brought the average tariff from about $0.025/kWh after the \nAsian financial crisis to $0.068/kWh in late 2003, a major accomplishment and proof of the successful socialization \nby the Government of this politically sensitive issue. Since then, the average tariff has decreased to $0.062/kWh \ndue to rupiah depreciation and changes in the consumption structure. \n   ", "42  Appendix 2 \nPLN managed to overcome the disastrous effects of the Asian financial crisis and gradually \nreduce its net operating loss from Rp5.5 trillion in 1999 until a net operating income of Rp2.6 \ntrillion was generated in 2004.21 However, the fuel subsidy removal in 2005 has had a major \nnegative impact on the financial performance of PLN, which uses diesel oil for almost 20% of its \ngeneration. Despite a massive subsidy of Rp12.5 trillion, the positive trend was reversed in \n2005, as PLN was unable to pass the sharp domestic oil price increases on to its customers. In \n2006 the subsidy is projected to more than double to about Rp28 trillion.  \n \nF.  Oil and Gas \n \n16.  Although Indonesia is the world\u2019s sixth largest natural gas producer and supplies about a \nquarter of the world\u2019s liquefied natural gas from its fields in Aceh and Kalimantan, until recently \nthe abundance of cheap oil limited the domestic use of natural gas. Moreover, lack of clarity \nregarding  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment  and  poor  incentives  in  terms  of  return  on \ninvestment  hampered  expansion in current production-sharing contracts and new gas field \nexploration.22 Several recent developments have set the stage for natural gas playing a much \nmore important role. First, Indonesia has been on the verge of becoming a net oil importer over \nthe last two years. Second, the fuel subsidy reductions in March and October 2005 have made \nnatural gas competitive. Third, the legal and regulatory framework has been strengthened. As a \nresult,  private  investors  are  poised  to  develop  new  large  gas  fields,  and  PLN  is  keen  to \nsubstantially increase the share of natural gas in its generation mix. Major pipeline projects \nand/or liquefied natural gas terminals need to be implemented to bring natural gas to the Java \nmarket. For the former, a public-private partnership project successfully completed by the State \nGas Corporation (PGN) is one possible approach.23 \n \n17.  The Oil and Gas Law 22/2001, together with the related implementing regulations,24 \nprovides a basis for gas sector restructuring by ending the monopoly of the State Oil and Gas \nCorporation  (Pertamina)  both  in  the  upstream  and  downstream  part  of  the  sector,  and \nestablishing  separate  contracting  authorities  for  these  parts  (BP  Migas  and  BPH  Migas). \nThough similar in its philosophy to the annulled Electricity Law 20/2002 (para. 14), the Oil and \nGas  Law  22/2001  was  upheld  by  the  Constitutional  Court  in  December  2005,  except  for \nprovisions related to domestic market obligations, and oil and gas pricing. The Constitutional \nCourt ruled that a minimum allocation for the domestic market should be stipulated for oil and \ngas producers, and that gas prices should be set administratively rather than be determined by \ncompetition.  \n \n                                                 \n19  The renegotiations were a complex and protracted exercise with a successful final outcome. Of the 27 independent \npower producer contracts totaling 11,300 MW, 14 contracts for 5,690 MW were continued under renegotiated \nterms, 6 contracts for 4,490 MW were terminated, 6 contracts for 900 MW were acquired by the Government and \nits SOEs, and only 1 contract for 220 MW ended in a legal dispute. \n20  The subsidies were introduced to compensate PLN for its low tariff for small consumers and amounted to Rp4.7 \ntrillion in 2002, Rp4.1 trillion in 2003, and Rp3.5 trillion in 2004. \n21  PLN\u2019s net income after interest, taxes, and foreign exchange losses was negative throughout this period, but the \nloss decreased from Rp6.1 trillion in 2002 to Rp2.0 trillion in 2004. \n22  Gas contracts signed before 1971 still account for almost 60% of Indonesia\u2019s commercial reserves, and large gas \nfields have remained unexplored. \n23  PGN created a subsidiary company for the construction and operation of the Grissik-Duri-Batam-Singapore gas \ntransmission pipelines with a combined length of about 1,000 kilometers and divested a stake in this company to a \nstrategic investor through a competitive bidding process. The project was supported by an Asian Development \nBank loan of $218 million, with cofinancing of $195 million provided by Japan Bank for International Cooperation. \n24  The  government  regulations  on  Implementing  Agency  (BP  Migas),  Regulatory  Agency  (BPH  Migas), \nCorporatization of Pertamina, Upstream Businesses, Downstream Businesses, and Appointment of the Head of \nImplementing Agency, as well as the Presidential Decree on the Establishment of Regulatory Agency, issued \nduring 2002\u20132004.  \n ", "Appendix 2  43 \n18.  BPH  Migas  has  undergone  capacity  building  to  fully  operationalize  its  downstream \nregulatory  functions.  Under  the  current  arrangements,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral \nResources is responsible for policy making, regulation of upstream activities, and together with \nBPH Migas, regulation of downstream activities.25 BP Migas acts as the contracting authority for \nupstream work and BPH Migas for downstream.  \n \nG.  Telecommunications \n \n19.  Except for a few years when the impact of the Asian financial crisis was strongly felt \nacross the country, the fixed line service has shown double-digit annual growth since 1970. The \ntotal number of fixed lines exceeds 11 million, but given Indonesia\u2019s large population, the \ncoverage is among the lowest in the region.26 A large disparity exists between urban and rural \nareas.27 As elsewhere in the region, mobile communication has enjoyed explosive growth since \n1995, reaching about 27 million mobile phone users in 2004. The density is thus more than \ntwice as high as for fixed lines.28 While the number of Internet users has also increased to about \n8 million, Indonesia lags most countries in the region.29 \n \n20.  Until  1999  the  responsibility  for  the  provision  of  telecommunications  services  was \nassigned to two SOEs. Telkom was designated as the so-called organizing body and granted \nexclusivity for domestic services (both local and long distance), while Indosat played this role for \ninternational  services.  Law  36/1999  on  Telecommunications  and  the  related  implementing \nregulations provided the basis for major sector reforms. These are outlined in the 1999 sector \nblueprint  that  envisages  a  gradual  transition  to  full  competition  by  2010.  The  Government \nremoved  the  respective  monopolies  of  Telkom  and  Indosat,  partially  privatized  them,30 \neliminated  their  cross-holdings  in  other  operators,  and  established  the  Indonesian \nTelecommunication Regulatory Body (BRTI). While competition is strong in the profitable mobile \nphone market,31 Telkom continues to monopolize the fixed-line business, using its dominant \nposition as a provider of basic infrastructure. Indosat has made little inroads in this market \nsegment, despite having a license for domestic local and long-distance services. Telkom is also \ndominant in Internet services.32  \n \nH.  Water Supply and Sanitation33\n \n21.  Among the various infrastructure sectors in Indonesia, water supply and sanitation are in \nthe  worst  technical  and  financial  condition.  Only  about  40  million  people,  or  18%  of  the \npopulation,  are  connected  to  piped  water  supply  from  regional  water  supply  companies \n(PDAMs). Even in urban areas, only 33% of people receive piped water. The remaining urban \npopulation depends on individual wells, small-scale providers, or water vendors, often at high \n                                                 \n25  The regulatory role within the ministry is exercised by its Directorate General of Oil and Gas (DG Migas). \n26  About 4 fixed lines per 100 inhabitants, compared to about 4 in the Philippines, 5 in India, 6 in Viet Nam, 11 in \nThailand, 18 in Malaysia, and more than 20 in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n27  The six largest cities\u2014Jakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, Bandung, Medan, and Denpasar\u2014with less than 10% of the \ncountry\u2019s population account for almost 50% of all fixed lines.  \n28  About 9 mobile phones per 100 inhabitants, which is well above India (2) and Viet Nam (3), but distinctly below \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (22), Philippines (27), Thailand (40), and Malaysia (45). \n29  Less than 4 users per 100 inhabitants, compared to about 2 in India, 4 in the Philippines and Viet Nam, 6 in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, 11 in Thailand, and 34 in Malaysia. \n30  The privatization started with the listing of Telcom and Indosat on the New York stock exchange in 1995 when \nabout 5% of shares were offered to the public. It continued with a few subsequent listings and partial divestments, \nwith the largest transactions undertaken in the banking subsector. \n31  Six companies have national licenses, among which Telkomsel is leading with a market share of about 50%. \n32  Of the approximately 190 licensed Internet service providers, some 35 are active. Telkom controls over 60% of the \nmarket.  \n33  Data in this subsection are derived from World Bank. 2004. Indonesia. Averting an Infrastructure Crisis: A \nFramework for Policy and Action. Jakarta. \n   ", "44  Appendix 2 \ncost. In rural areas, the situation is much worse. Only about 15% of rural households get \ndrinking water from pipe or pump sources, with PDAMs accounting for about half of it. The \nmajority of rural households still rely on shallow groundwater extraction or rainwater collection, \nor  use  surface  water  from  nearby  rivers  or  springs.  The  poor  are  affected  most  by  this \nunsatisfactory situation. Countrywide, less than 20% of the poor have access to safe drinking \nwater, compared to more than 80% of the rich. The poor pay water vendors up to five times \nmore than the rich who use piped water.  \n \n22.  Wastewater disposal is almost entirely handled by local governments. Indonesia has one \nof the lowest rates of urban sewerage coverage in Asia. Only seven cities have some form of \nsewerage networks that reach just 10% of urban residents. Over 70% of urban households have \non-site sanitation, mostly in the form of septic tanks that are not functioning effectively. In rural \nareas, less than 30% of households have toilet facilities, and only about 20% septic tanks. The \nlack of adequate sewerage systems, combined with inadequate solid waste management, has \ncaused widespread contamination of surface and groundwater. These conditions explain the \nhigh incidence of waterborne diseases. Indonesia has the highest incidence of typhoid in East \nAsia, and diarrhea is the second largest cause of death among young children. \n \n23.  The  more  than  300  PDAMs  are  under  the  jurisdiction  and  ownership  of  local \ngovernments. The majority are struggling, with their financial situation deteriorating and service \nquality falling. About 70% of the PDAMs are heavily indebted, having on their books more than \n400 outstanding loans from the Ministry of Finance that need to be restructured; almost two \nthirds are in arrears or default.34 Tariffs are well below cost-recovery levels, and often do not \neven cover costs for operation and maintenance. The PDAMs function with little autonomy from \nlocal governments, which keep tariffs artificially low and demand dividends that reduce funds for \nmaintenance and investments. Total annual PDAM losses are very high. Averaging about 40%, \nunaccounted for water is clearly excessive and loss reduction programs have been mostly \nunsuccessful. The large number of PDAMs is a concern, because many are too small to be \nsustainable. \n \n24.  The sector suffers from low investment, a situation aggravated by the Asian financial \ncrisis.  Particularly  in  sanitation,  investment  has  been  almost  negligible,  and  cost  recovery \nconsidered irrelevant. Annual investments of about $600 million are estimated to meet the \nMillennium Development Goals for water supply and sanitation.35 The bulk of financing will have \nto come from cash generated by the PDAMs and local government budgets. This calls for major \nimprovements in the self-financing capacity of PDAMs, and in the borrowing capacity and \nfinancial management of local governments. Ensuring access of the latter to long-term finance \nis particularly important. The gap between the investment needs and public sources of funds, \nincluding foreign borrowing, will have to be closed by sharply increased PSP.36 \n                                                 \n34  The money owed by the PDAMs to MOF totals about Rp5 trillion. \n35  The target is: Halving by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water, and \nsignificantly improving by 2020 the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers through improved sanitation and other \nmeasures. \n36  Except for three water supply concessions (two in Jakarta and one in Batam), PSP in the sector has been \ninsignificant. \n ", "  45\nAppendix 4   45 \nTable A2: Key Infrastructure Issues \n \n         \nSector  Legal Framework  Regulatory Framework  Financial Sustainability  Other Issues \nOil and Gas  \u2022 Oil and Gas Law 22/2001  \u2022 Operationalization of BPH  \u2022 Fuel subsidies   \u2022  Gas exploration \n(amendment)  Migas  \u2022 Domestic gas pricing  \u2022  Gas transmission \n\u2022  IRs   \nPower  \u2022 Electricity Law 20/2002  \u2022 New independent regulatory  \u2022 Electricity tariffs   \u2022 Capacity shortages \n(revision)  body   \u2022 Lifeline tariff  \u2022 Rural electrification strategy \n\u2022 Energy Law (new)  \u2022 PSO policy \n\u2022 IRs  \nRoads  \u2022  IRs for Road Law 38/2004  \u2022 Operationalization of BPJT  \u2022 Toll road fees   \u2022 Road development and \n\u2022 Road user charges  maintenance \n\u2022 Road fund  \u2022 Vehicle overloading  \n\u2022 PSO policy  \u2022 Road traffic safety \nPorts  \u2022 Maritime Law 21/1992  \u2022 New independent regulatory  \u2022 Port tariffs  \u2022 Port security \n(revision)  body   \u2022 PSO policy   \u2022 Regional autonomy \n\u2022 IRs \nAirports  \u2022 Aviation Law 15/1992  \u2022 New independent regulatory  \u2022 Airport tariffs  \u2022 Airport security \n(revision)  body  \u2022 PSO policy   \u2022 Regional autonomy \n\u2022 IRs  \u2022 Separation between airport   \u2022 Air traffic services \n  and air traffic service \noperation \nRailways  \u2022  Railway Law 13/1992  \u2022 New independent regulatory  \u2022 Railway tariffs  \u2022 Competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis \n(revision)  body  \u2022 TAC, IMO, and PSO policy  other transport modes \n\u2022  IRs \nTelecommunications  \u2022  IR on interconnection  \u2022 Operationalization of BRTI  \u2022 Telecommunications tariffs  \u2022 Duopoly structure \n\u2022 PSO policy  \u2022 Service coverage in rural \nareas  \nWater Supply and  \u2022  IRs for Water Resources Law  \u2022 Operationalization of BPP  \u2022 Debt restructuring  \u2022 Unaccounted for water  \nSanitation  7/2004  SPAM  \u2022 PDAM  consolidation  \u2022 Service coverage \n\u2022 Water and sewerage tariffs   \n\u2022 PSO policy  \nCross-Sector Issues \nPrivate Sector  \u2022 Government commitment to reform (IISs)  A\nParticipation  \u2022 PSP framework (revision of Keppres 7/1998)  p\np\n\u2022 Central level coordination (KKPPI and PPP network)  e\nn\n\u2022 Stakeholder consultations (CIIF)  d\nix\n\u2022 Land acquisition   2\n\u2022 Project preparation and execution   \n4\n5\n \n \n    \n \n ", " \n4\n6\n \nRisk Management  \u2022 Risk management policy \n\u2022 Institutional arrangements (Risk Management Committee/Unit)  A\np\np\nInfrastructure  \u2022 Pension funds and insurance  e\nn\nFinancing  \u2022 Infrastructure funds  d\nix\n\u2022 Government bond market   2\n \n\u2022 Onlending and ongranting to local governments \n\u2022 Municipal and rural infrastructure finance facility \n \nBPH Migas = Badan Pengatur Hilir Minyak dan Gas (Regulatory Body for Oil and Gas Downstream Business), BPJT = Badan Pengatur Jalan Tol (Indonesian Toll Road Authority), BPP \nSPAM = Badan Pendukung Pengembangan Sistem Penyediaan Air Minimum (National Water Regulatory Agency), BRTI = Badan Regulasi Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Indonesian \nTelecommunication Regulatory Body), CIIF = Consolidated Indonesia Infrastructure Forum, IIS = Indonesia Infrastructure Summit, IMO = installation, maintenance, and operation, IR = \nimplementing regulation, KKPPI = Komite Kebijakan Percepatan Pembangunan Infrastruktur (Committee on Policy for the Acceleration of Infrastructure Development), PDAM = Perusahaan \nDaerah Air Minum (local public water utility), PPP = public-private partnership, PSO = public service obligation, PSP = private sector participation, TAC = track access charge. \n \nSource: ADB staff. \n ", "Appendix 3  47 \nLetter of Development Policy from the Government of Indonesia \nInfrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \n \n \n \n24 October 2006 \nJakarta, Indonesia \n \n \nMr. Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident  \nAsian Development Bank \nManila, Philippines \n \nDear Mr. Kuroda:  \n \nI.  Introduction  \n1.  The Government of Indonesia (the Government) has now successfully completed almost \ntwo years in office.  With principal focus on accelerating economic growth and reducing poverty \nand regional disparities, the Government has progressed on the reform agenda against a backdrop \nof extraordinary circumstances in 2004-2006. The devastating natural disasters in several areas \nsuch as Aceh, Nias, Yogyakarta, Central and West Java and South Sulawesi, while posing \nenormous challenges, have not deterred us from moving ahead on national economic priorities. \nIn  parallel,  the  Government  has  also  made  marked  progress  on  the  governance  front,  by \nstrengthening key institutions and considerably enhancing transparency.   \n2.  The Indonesian economy grew at 5.6% in 2005 - the best performance ever since the \ncrisis. Growth in 2006, and to some extent in 2007, will be conditioned by the Government\u2019s \nbold decision in October 2005 to reduce the escalating fuel subsidies and bring domestic fuel-oil \nprices closer to international parity. For 2006, our growth projection of 5.7-5.9% hinges on \naccelerating development spending in the second half of the year. Fiscal consolidation has been \nour principal anchor in macroeconomic management, and it will continue to guide us in the \nfuture. However, recognizing that Indonesia lags behind in health and education attainments, and \nin infrastructure access, the Government is poised to scale up public spending in these areas. As \na result, we aim at a higher deficit of 1.3% in 2006 while for 2007 the deficit is projected at \n1.1%. A comprehensive community-driven development program is under preparation to scaleup \nthe provision of public services and infrastructure in the regions.    \n  \n3.  Notwithstanding the favorable macroeconomic performance, the Government is acutely \naware that the current levels of economic growth would still not be enough to create sufficient \njob opportunities, reduce employment and cut poverty levels. For the economy to generate 2 \nmillion new jobs every year and to create wealth to halve poverty to around 8% by 2010, \nIndonesia needs to grow at 7-8% every year. Investments \u2013 particularly in infrastructure \u2013 are \nvital to accelerate growth. Indonesia used to invest upwards of 6% of GDP on infrastructure prior \n ", "48  Appendix 3 \nto  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis.  Now,  with  investments  at  around  2%  of  GDP,  poor \ninfrastructure is already starting to constrain the pace of our economic growth and impact the \nquality  of  our  basic  public  services.  Since  the  crisis,  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  support \ninfrastructure development has been limited by budgetary constraints. As a result, we confront a \nsubstantial infrastructure financing gap. Indonesia is now at a critical juncture where we need to \naccelerate public spending on infrastructure, as well as to attract private sector participation \n(PSP). PSP in infrastructure is accordingly an imperative rather than an option.  \n \n4.  Enhancing  PSP  and  formulating  effective  public  private  partnerships  (PPPs)  in \ninfrastructure provision need wide-ranging sector and cross-sector reforms. We requested the \ndevelopment partners for support in articulating as well as implementing reforms following the \nJanuary  2005  Indonesia  Infrastructure  Summit.  Subsequently,  the  Government  adopted  a \ncomprehensive Infrastructure Policy Package (IPP) in February 2006 which outline the key \ninitial  actions  to  be  taken  by  the  line  ministries,  state-owned  enterprises  and  infrastructure \ncontracting agencies in 2006. The IPP benefited from inputs from development partners, under \nADB\u2019s coordination. Based on the work done over the last one-and-half years, a medium-term \nreform  program  has  been  put  together,  as  outlined  in  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector \nDevelopment Program (IRSDP). The IRSDP expands the agenda in the IPP to clearly outline \nreforms during 2005-2010, as the complex regulatory, institutional and policy changes need time \nand significant consensus building.   \n \n5.  This Letter of Development Policy is in support of our request that the ADB approve the \noverall IRSDP cluster comprising three subprograms and a $400 million loan for Subprogram 1 \nto disburse in fiscal year 2006. We have also requested the World Bank and the Government of \nJapan (GOJ) to provide co-financing support for the reforms implemented under Subprogram 1 \nof IRSDP. The Letter should be read in conjunction with the Policy Matrix (Attachment 1), and \ntogether they constitute this Government\u2019s medium-term reform commitment in infrastructure \nsectors. \n \nII.  Infrastructure  Reforms  \u2013  Achievements,  the  Road  Ahead,  and  Our  Vision  and \n  Commitment \nA.  The Challenge and Scope of Reforms \n6.   Focus on Good Governance: Since taking office in October 2004, the Government has \nfocused on ensuring good governance in public administration. We have reforms underway in a \nwide  range  of  areas  with  focus  on  preventing  corruption,  including:  procurement,  public \nfinancial management, internal controls and auditing, and gradual progress towards performance \norientation. In parallel, we have taken significant measures to strengthen our institutions such as \nthe  Anti-Corruption  Commission  (KPK),  the  Anti-Corruption  Court,  and  the  Judicial \nCommission,  among  others.  In  the  infrastructure  sectors  in  particular,  the  Government  is \ncommitted to enhancing governance along several directions which includes: policy, legal and \nregulatory  framework;  sector-level  planning  and  implementation;  and  open  and  transparent \nproject transactions. \n7.   Sector Coverage: Given the need to enhance the quality and quantity of infrastructure \nservices  across  the  board,  our  program  \u2013  as  encapsulated  by  the  IRSDP  -  covers  nine \n ", "Appendix 3  49 \ninfrastructure sectors, including land transportation, toll roads, railways, air transportation, sea \ntransportation, power, oil and gas, telecommunications, and water supply and sanitation. Such a \nwide coverage means a plethora of complex reforms. We have used the time since the first \nIndonesia Infrastructure Summit in January 2005 to draft amendments to various laws and \nregulations, strengthen institutional structures, and put in place initial sector plans and blue \nprints, to pave way for accelerating infrastructure development through public investments and \ngreater PSP. These sector plans will be updated during the course of IRSDP, as well as used a \nbasis by KKPPI for recommending Government support to the Ministry of Finance. A new roads \nlaw was enacted in 2004, and the drafts of new laws on electricity, railways, sea transport and air \ntransport are now being deliberated by Parliament.  \n8.   Access Issues: The lack of investments and the absence of an accommodative framework \nover  the  last  decade  have  prevented  Indonesia  from  increasing  access  to  infrastructure.  In \nparticular, we face serious power shortages in some regions and lack of access to adequate and \nclean water supply and sanitation facilities in general across the country. In the power sector, if \nwe take \u201celectricity for all\u201d as the goal by 2020, we need to achieve about 1 million new \nconnections in rural areas every year. At present, we are in the 200,000-300,000 range with \nregard to rural electrification. Only 18% of the country has access to safe and clean drinking \nwater supply through piped sources. Given the archipelagic nature of the country, inter-island sea \ntransportation  is  very  vital,  but  the  service  coverage  is  inadequate.  Accelerating  economic \ngrowth needs greater access to roads of high quality, an area where we need to construct at least \nabout 1,000 kilometers of new tollroad networks by 2009, not including the other national and \nlocal level highways. Our line ministries are committed to developing comprehensive sector \ncoverage strategies - building on the masterplans and blueprints developed - particularly in the \npower, roads, and water supply and sanitation sectors. In particular, through the course of \nIRSDP, the concerned line ministries and/or agencies have undertaken to: \n\u2022  Refine the Government\u2019s electricity access strategy by considering options including the \npotential  contributions  of  user  payments  and  subsidies,  the  role  of  sub-national \ngovernments, and regionally differentiated approaches to electricity access; \n\u2022  Refine  water  access  strategy  by:  (i)  setting  targets  based  on  credible  financing \narrangements;  (ii)  addressing  the  relative  roles  of  financing  through  development \nassistance, domestic borrowing, user tariffs and government subsidy; (iii) developing \ncriteria  for  access  by  regional  water  utilities  (PDAMs)  to  government  finance  that \nprovides incentives for enhanced financial performance; and (iv) developing approaches \nfor reducing the level of PDAM debt arrears. \n9.   Affordability: The present Government has been bold in sharply reducing the fuel oil \nsubsidies in March and October 2005. It has also adopted regulations in some sectors allowing \nfor cost-based tariff setting policies, for instance for water supply and toll roads. Our regulatory \nframework (elaborated below in para.17 below) provides for full cost recovery to enable greater \nPSP. However, the Government will have to balance economic growth considerations vis-\u00e0-vis \nsocial balance and equity. Our subsidy policies are gradually moving towards more equity, by \ntargeting and protecting the poor and charging progressively higher tariffs for those with greater \nability and willingness to pay.  \n ", "50  Appendix 3 \n10.   Public  Service  Obligations  (PSO):  As  we  accelerate  infrastructure  development, \nequitable access to services is an important issue to address, given the geographic spread and size \nof the country. There are significant PSOs in some sectors. Several SOEs have mandated and \nclear PSOs that they are obliged to fulfill. In some sectors, subsidized services are delivered \nthrough other modalities (including contracting out to private operators). The basic issue in such \ncases is that services cannot be provided on a full-cost recovery basis. As part of the IRSDP, the \nGovernment is committed to adopting a uniform and consistent PSO policy across all sectors. \nFurther,  each  sector  ministry  will  also  prepare  a  sector-specific  PSO  policy  and  begin  its \nimplementation during the course of IRSDP, to ensure that the PSO obligations are delivered. \nFurther, it is our view that PSO provision can also be fulfilled through greater PSP, besides \nincreasing efficiency.  \nB.  Accelerating PSP \n11.   Basics for Enhancing PSP: While we see the need for PSP, we also acknowledge that it \nwill not be easy to persuade private sector investors to meet it. As in other sectors, we understand \nthat investment decisions are taken on the basis of perceptions of risk and expectations of return. \nAnd, we are aware that risk perceptions are currently deterring many prospective infrastructure \ninvestors and lenders, or otherwise causing them to seek levels of return that are socially and \npolitically unsustainable. Thus, our ability to meet our expectations for PPPs in infrastructure \nprovision will depend in considerable measure on our ability to address risk issues. \n12.   We acknowledge, at the outset, that our initial high targets for private infrastructure \ninvestment have not been met. On the other hand, we do have to stress that we have learned \nmany important lessons as a result, and are now starting to apply these. The Government has \naccelerated reform of infrastructure sector policies, including by: \n\u2022  Establishing more transparent and predictable regulatory regimes; \n\u2022  Eliminating  inappropriate  State-enterprise  \u2018exclusivities\u2019  that  preclude  or  inhibit \ncompetition \n\u2022  Enabling improved modalities for PPPs \n \n13.   Scope  for  PPPs:  PPPs  are  not  really  new  in  Indonesia.  We  have  opened  our \ninfrastructure activities to the private sector back in the early 1990s. But, not all past experiences \ndealing with PPPs were considered a success story. Our experience in the electricity sector is \nobviously one example of bad story. That failure of implementing PPPs has not only created a \nsignificant financial cost to the Government and State Electricity Corporation (PLN) but also has \nundermined our credibility. We do not want repeat those bad experiences and we intend to adopt \nbest practices for the PPP.  \n14.   Need for Change Management: Opening the doors to private infrastructure investment \nnecessarily  requires  behavioral  and  cultural  changes  in  the  government  agencies  and  State \nenterprises tasked with project preparation, tendering, negotiation, and implementation oversight. \nWe  recognize  and  acknowledge  that  we  have  previously  underestimated  the  scope  and \ncomplexity of the needed changes. The Government is taking the following actions in order to \nreduce the resistance of the public to PPPs: \n ", "Appendix 3  51 \n\u2022  Involve stakeholders from the initial stages of PPP projects; \n\u2022  Clearly show the objective of PPP projects through proper public relations; and \n\u2022  Present and process and adequate number of model projects as showcases of PPPs. \n \n15.   Foundational Regulatory Framework for PSP: Overcoming the above problems will \nrequire strong direction and leadership, both at the political level and within the responsible \ninstitutions.  We  have  reactivated  the  National  Committee  on  Acceleration  of  Infrastructure \nDevelopment (KKPPI) \u2013 as a mechanism for driving and facilitating decision-making. One of the \nearly tasks assigned to KKPPI was to prepare an improved cross-sector regulation on PPPs. As \noutlined in the IRSDP policy matrix, the Government has taken a set of key regulatory measures \nin enhancing PSP. We have adopted Presidential Regulation No.67/2005, that defines the \u2018rules \nof  the  game\u2019  for  PSP  as  well  as  cooperation  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  in \ninfrastructure provision which is in line with international best practice. \nC.  Designing PPPs Effectively \u2013 Need for Project Preparation \n16.   We also recognize that many of the projects offered to the private sector recently, for \nvarious reasons, have not been prepared to sufficiently high standards. In particular, feasibility \nstudies  and  other  documentation  have  not  provided  adequate  information  for  prospective \ninvestors on some key risk areas. Unfortunately, time is not on our side here, and we cannot \nafford to restart the preparation process for all projects in our current pipeline. Rather, the \nGovernment is now pursuing a two-fold strategy under which we are: \n\u2022  Striving  to  improve  the  documentation  of  projects  that  are  already  far  advanced  in \npreparation; and, in parallel \n\u2022  Initiating the preparation of a carefully selected set of \u201cbest practice\u201d demonstration \nprojects, which also serve as models for the future. \n \n17.   Project Preparation: In view of the capacity constraints at national and local levels, the \nGovernment is now establishing a Project Development Facility (PDF) \u2013 included under the \nIRSDP \u2013 to ensure that adequate funding is available for the timely preparation of promising \nprojects to the exacting standards expected by prospective investors and lenders. The PDF will \nhelp develop the Government\u2019s own capacity, while at the same time building a robust pipeline \nof PPP projects. BAPPENAS is in the process of establishing a PPP Central Unit to coordinate \nthe implementation of the overall PPP framework. The PDF will be an integral part of the PPP \nCentral Unit, and its activities will be fully coordinated with that of the Unit.  \nD.  Accelerating PPPs \u2013 Need for Model PPP Transactions \n18.   Translating the good policy, legal and regulatory measures accomplished over 2004-2006 \ninto improvements in infrastructure access calls  for actual project transactions. At the first \nIndonesia Infrastructure Summit in January 2005, the Government announced a catalogue of 91 \nprojects in the various sectors. We have made some progress in the interim, with about 20 \nprojects in the power and toll road sectors in particular going through the pre-qualification or \nbidding stages. A few projects have been awarded in the gas, power and water supply sectors. \nEfforts are underway at present to achieve financial closure. Far more needs to be done.  \n ", "52  Appendix 3 \n19.   As part of the IRSDP, the Government has identified several candidate Model PPP \nProjects, which are presented in Table 1 at the end of this letter. The Government will table \ndetailed information memoranda on as many of these projects as possible at the November 2006 \nInfrastructure Conference and Exhibition. These Model PPP Projects will fully comply with \nPerpres No.67/2005 and MOF Decree No.38/2006. Their preparation will be supported by the \nPDF or other available sources. In parallel, as part of the preparatory process, the KKPPI and \nMOF will work together with the line ministry or contracting agency concerned in determining \nthe type and level of Government risk-sharing support for the projects. Once this decision is \ntaken, then the PDF or other sources will help in the bidding and transaction execution process. \nOur goal is that as many of the Model PPP Projects as possible would have reached the bidding \nstage during the course of 2007. We will also initiate preparatory work for a subsequent set of \nPPP projects to be pursued over 2007-2010. We need to adopt a gradual approach in executing \nsuch  projects.  Our  line  ministries  also  need  to  build  consensus  and,  where  applicable,  to \nconvince the concerned SOE to adopt the best possible approach from the country\u2019s point of \nview. But, we remain confident that a number of good PPP projects will be identified, prepared \nand implemented during the course of IRSDP.  \nE.  Accelerating Infrastructure Development through PPPs \u2013 Need for Prudent Risk-\n  Sharing Arrangements \n20.   Risk-Sharing Framework: The Perpres No.67/2005 framework is supplemented by the \nMinister  of  Finance  Regulation  No.38/2006  on  Implementing  Control  and  Management  of \nInfrastructure Provision Risks. This regulation highlights the need for the risk management \nprocess to support the provision of infrastructure so as to enable more rapid economic growth \nwhile ensuring fiscal sustainability. Among others, it defines: \n\u2022  The types of risk that the Government is willing to bear or share, namely certain types of \npolitical, project performance, and demand risks; \n\u2022  The types of Government contingent support that can be considered, and the criteria to be \nused in deciding the form and amount of Government support; \n\u2022  The procedures to be followed in evaluating and responding to requests for Government \nsupport, including making the needed budgetary provision; and \n\u2022  The requirements for monitoring and reporting on the evolution of project risks.   \n \n21.   Initial  Allocation  of  Resources  for  Risk  Sharing:  To  help  implement  the  risk \nmanagement framework effectively, a Risk Management Center (RMC) has been established in \nMOF. In order to help operationalize the framework, the Government has proposed that about \nRp.2.5 trillion be set aside in the 2006 and 2007 budgets for risk-sharing support. Subject to \nneeds, it is envisaged that adequate resources can be allocated in the 2007 supplementary budget, \nand 2008 and 2009 budgets. In the initial stages, tentatively July 2006-June 2007, the RMC will \nfunction with the help of consultants while at the same time building the capacity of MOF staff \nin risk assessments. The RMC will become operational with a full complement of qualified staff \nfrom mid-2007 onwards. \n22.   Institutional Arrangements for Determining Risk Sharing Support: The Government \nis close to finalizing a Government Regulation on Investment Funds under the Treasury Law \n(Law No.1/2004). This is expected to be completed and endorsed by the President before the end \n ", "Appendix 3  53 \nof 2006. In parallel, the Ministry of Finance is working with the ADB and World Bank on \nestablishing a Guarantee Fund by June 2007. The Rp.2.5 trillion that has been tentatively set \naside from the State Budget for risk-sharing purposes will be held in the Guarantee Fund, as the \nGovernment\u2019s initial contribution. In addition, we have also requested the development partners \nto support the strengthening of the Guarantee Fund through their partial credit guarantee or risk \nmanagement products. In order to ensure good governance, particularly to adhere to the highest \nprinciples of fairness and transparency, the Guarantee Fund shall be used only for those PPP \nprojects that fully comply with all the provisions of Perpres No.67/2005 and MOF Decree \nNo.38/2006.  \n23.   Overarching  Focus  on  Good  Governance  in  Determining  Risk-Sharing:  At  the \noutset, the principles that underlie our policy on risk sharing are as follows:  \n\u2022  Some Government support is necessary and should be given in accordance with the risk \nsharing framework; \n\u2022  Risk must be allocated to the party that is best able to manage it; and \n\u2022  The level of Government support will be gradually reduced along with improvements in \ninvestment climate. \n \n24.   With limited resources available and the past mixed history of Government support, it is \ncritical that we adhere to strict good governance norms. One such principle is transparency, and \nMOF has been strictly adhering to this. For purposes of determining Government support, we \nhave categorized projects into three types: \n\u2022  Category 1: Projects to be Directly Executed by the Government or Contracting \nAgencies: Given the urgent need to expand the provision of infrastructure services, the \nGovernment  plans  to  design  and  execute  infrastructure  projects  with  public  sector \nresources (including foreign loans guaranteed by the Government). An example is the \n10,000 MW crash program for electricity generation. This program will be executed by \nPLN. There may be other programs or projects of this nature emerging in the future, \nwherein our goal will be to enhance infrastructure provision.  \n\u2022  Category 2: PPP Projects (Awarded through Bidding) or Other Projects (Awarded \nthrough Direct Selection) prior to Perpres No.67/2005 and MOF Decree No.38/2006: \nFor this category we will apply all the relevant provisions of our regulatory framework in \ndetermining Government support. If the proposed projects do not meet the requirements \nof Perpres No.67/2005 and MOF Decree No.38/2006, then we will apply the principles of \ntransparency, accountability, proper risk allocation and sharing, and fiscal prudence in \ndetermining  fiscal  support  for  such  projects  through  the  general  budget  allocation \nprocess.  \n \n\u2022  Category  3:  PPP  Projects  Prepared  and  Awarded  on  the  Basis  of  Perpres \nNo.67/2005 and MOF Decree No.38/2006: Our commitment is that this is the only \ncategory of projects - which also includes the Model PPP Projects (see para.20 above) \npursued  through  IRSDP  or  other  initiatives  \u2013  that  will  be  supported  through  the \nGuarantee Fund, subject to the needs and all the criteria being fully met in a fully \n ", "54  Appendix 3 \nsatisfactory manner. Some projects may also be supported through the general budget \nallocation process, if the needs so warrant. \n25. Need for Transparency: In determining Government support, our foremost aim is to adhere \nstrictly to the principles of good governance, anchored on transparency and fiscal prudence. At \nthe same time, the Government needs to adopt a pragmatic approach, as this is the first time \nsince the financial crisis that the Government is attempting to deal in a systematic manner with \npublic support for large scale infrastructure projects. Nonetheless, from an overall resource \nallocation point of view, we will adhere to a key underlying principle that the Category 3 \nprojects should not be crowded out by support for the other categories. The Government is also \naware of the importance of open competitive selection processes and of the need for Cooperation \nAgreements to align with accepted international practices, including in particular in the area of \nrisk allocation and sharing. With this in the background, we have been working to develop \nimproved model agreements in sectors such as toll roads, power, ports, airports, railways, water, \nand gas pipelines. \nF.  Other Essential Reforms in Attracting and Implementing PPPs \n26.   Leveling the Playing Field: Our vision is to achieve clarity of institutional roles in the \nprovision of key infrastructure services, including through assigning responsibilities for policy-\nmaking,  contracting,  operational,  and  regulatory  functions  to  separate  agencies.  As  each \nperforms specific tasks, there should not be any conflict of interest in their roles. There already is \nsome  degree  of  separation  between  the  four  functions  in  particular  in  the  toll  roads, \ntelecommunications,  gas  and  water  supply  sectors.  Over  the  course  of  the  IRSDP,  the \nGovernment will continue the gradual separation of the four functions to eliminate any conflicts \nof interest and level the playing field. Though our vision is clear, the progress will be subject to \nthe relevant laws being adopted by Parliament, which is beyond the executive\u2019s authority. \n27.   Addressing  Social  Safeguards:  It  is  not  an  easy  challenge  to  balance  the  need  to \naccelerate large-scale infrastructure investments, and the need to maintain acceptable minimum \nsocial safeguards. In Indonesia, like in any other country, the issue of land acquisition is a \ncomplex subject. In 2005, Presidential Regulation No.36/2005 was adopted to replace the earlier \n1993 decree on land acquisition for public purpose. Subsequently, with a view to accelerating \ninfrastructure  investments,  we  have  further  amended  the  regulatory  framework  through \nPresidential Regulation No.65/2006. Together, we are confident that these two regulations will \nsatisfactorily resolve most of the residual problems. In particular, we believe this regulatory \nframework is a significant improvement over the previous set of regulations.  Once it comes into \neffect, land acquisition for public purposes will be more transparent and expeditious. Through \nthe IRSDP, we also commit to reducing the gaps between the Indonesian legal framework and \nthe policies of external financing partners. \n28.   Addressing  Environmental  Considerations:  As  Indonesia  moves  forward  to \naccelerate infrastructure development after the crisis, the Government is cognizant of the need \nfor stronger environmental protection policies and more effective implementation. We have \nalready taken steps to improve the overall legal and regulatory framework for environmental \nmanagement and are committed to enabling provision of adequate resources for AMDAL units \nat various levels of  \n ", "Appendix 3  55 \n ", "56  Appendix 3 \nTable 1: List of Candidate Public Private Partnership (PPP) Projects \nto be Pursued as Model PPPs \n \nProject  Key Features  Investment Line Ministry/Contracting Agency\n($ million) \nCentral Java Coal Fired Power  2X600 MW  1,200.0 MEMR/ PLN \nPlant  \nPasuruan Combined Cycle  1X500 MW  275.0 MEMR/PLN \nPower Plant \nMedan-Kuala Namu-Tebing  60 kilometers  142.0 MPW/BPJT \nTinggi Toll Road Project  \nSolo-Kertosono Toll Road  165 kilometers  928.0 BPJT \nProject  \nMargagiri-Ketapang Ferry  1.2 million  97.0 MOT \nTerminal  passengers/annum \nTeluk Lamong Seaport (Tanjung  1,280 meter berth  275.0 MOT \nPerak Port Expansion)  container terminal  \nBandung Water Supply Project  450 liters/second  26.0 Bandung Local Government/ BPP \nSPAM \nDumai Water Supply Project  500 liters/second  44.0 Dumai Local Government/BPP \nSPAM \nTangerang Water Supply Project   550 liters/second  37.0 Tangerang Local Government/BPP \nSPAM \nNational Telecommunications  30,000 kilometers of  1,500.0*  Ministry of Communications and \nBackbone Project  fiber optic network  Informatics \nTotal    4,524.0  \n \nBPJT - Indonesian Toll Road Authority; BPP SPAM - National Water Regulatory Agency; MEMR - \nMinistry of Energy and Mineral Resources; MOT - Ministry of Transport; MPW - Ministry of Public Works; \nPLN - State Electricity Corporation \n \n* - An alternative proposal has also been prepared focusing on creating a backbone network only for the \nEastern parts of Indonesia at a cost of $315 million. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 3  57 \n  POLICY MATRIX FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE REFORM SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM1   \n \nNo  Action  Output/Milestone  SP1  SP2  SP3 \nI.

Following the significant hike \nin interest rates and fuel price increases in the fall of 2005, real GDP growth slowed to under 5 \npercent in the last quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006 (y/y). However, growth picked up to \n5.2  percent  (y/y)  in  the  second  quarter,  mainly  reflecting  strong  external  demand  and  some \nacceleration in public consumption. Though still weak, private consumption appears to be picking \nup, indicating that the adjustment to the domestic fuel price hike last fall is nearly complete. \nNevertheless, unemployment is edging up and poverty rates remain high. Growth is expected to \npick up gradually over the course of 2006 and in 2007, with IMF staff projecting annual growth to \nreach 5.2 percent and 6 percent, respectively, as interest rates are reduced. Nevertheless, there are \nrisks to this outlook, most importantly a weakening of the international environment and slow \nimplementation of structural reforms.  \nInflationary pressures have been declining. Headline inflation declined to 14.6 percent (y/y) in \nSeptember, from 17.1 percent at end-2005, reflecting weak activity and some appreciation of the \nrupiah. Meanwhile, three-month annualized inflation (both headline and core) has remained below \n6 percent since the beginning of the year. On current trends, Bank Indonesia\u2019s (BI\u2019s) end-year \ntarget of 7\u20139 percent for headline inflation is well within reach.  \nThe overall banking sector continues to perform reasonably well. Partly due to reclassification, \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) increased substantially in 2005, especially at the two largest state \nbanks, but the rise in NPLs moderated in January\u2013June 2006. The sharp deceleration in credit \ngrowth in 2006, as a result of high interest rates and weak demand, will to some extent undermine \nbank profitability, but the expected reduction in interest rates should prevent excessive adverse \neffects on banks. Capital adequacy ratios remain at over 20 percent. \nExternal vulnerabilities continue to be reduced. The current account is expected to remain in \nsurplus in 2006. Foreign exchange reserves, at about $39 billion after the repayment of remaining \ndebt to the Fund of $3\u00bc billion on October 12, are equivalent to about 130 percent of short-term \ndebt. The current account is expected to move into small deficit over the medium term as imports \nrise faster than exports, financed in large part by private sector capital inflows. The ratio of \nexternal debt to GDP is expected to be reduced to below 25 percent of GDP in 2011, from 48 \npercent of GDP in 2005. Nevertheless, the market volatility experienced in May/June 2006 is a \nreminder  that  Indonesia  remains  susceptible  to  adverse  developments  in  international  capital \nmarkets. \nMacroeconomic and Structural Policies \nThe budgeted policy stance is broadly appropriate. The fiscal deficit targets of 1.3 percent of \nGDP for 2006 and 0.9 percent of GDP for 2007, as outlined in the President\u2019s budget speech in \n ", "72  Appendix 7 \nmid-August, are appropriately geared to further reducing the debt burden, to below 30 percent in \n2010  (compared  with  47  percent  at  end  2005),  while  supporting  activity  in  2006.  After \nconsiderable under spending in 2005 and the first quarter of 2006, budget execution improved in \nthe second quarter of 2006. \nMonetary  policy  continues  to  be  geared  to  reducing  inflation.  BI\u2019s  gradual  approach  to \nreducing its policy rate has helped contain inflationary pressures and increase foreign exchange \nreserves. There should be room for further gradual rate cuts given the benign inflation outlook and \nstill  large  differential  with  U.S.  interest  rates,  though  the  authorities  need  to  be  careful  that \nexcessive rate decreases do not undermine their credibility and prospects for achieving the 2007 \ninflation  target  of  5\u20137  percent.  The  clarity  and  consistency  of  statements  by  BI  officials  in \nsignaling  the  central  bank\u2019s  policy  intentions,  within  the  inflation  targeting  framework,  has \nimproved and is essential to maintaining credibility.  \nSteps are being taken to deal with NPLs at state banks. The recently signed Presidential decree \nallowing state banks to provide haircuts on loans, together with stepped-up efforts to enforce \ncollections, should help to resolve the NPL problem, and avoid erosion of bank capital. IMF staff \ncontinue to advise that medium-term strategies be adopted for the state banks, which should \ninvolve privatizing those that do not have a clear public policy objective. As regards private banks, \nsupervisors will need to remain vigilant to enforce regulations, and to monitor any deterioration in \ncredit quality.  \nThe government is proceeding on a broad range of fiscal reforms. Adoption of the tax package \nnow  before  Parliament,  along  the  lines  endorsed  by  the  business  community,  as  well  as \nmodernization of the tax department, will help enhance revenue collection while restoring investor \nconfidence.  The  government\u2019s  intention  to  better  manage  potential  risks  stemming  from  the \noperations of public enterprises and private-public partnerships is welcome. \nTo  improve  the  business  climate  and  boost  growth,  the  government  has  prepared  an \nimpressive reform agenda. Given the business community\u2019s concerns about implementation, \nsome major early reform successes are needed to increase confidence that the entire package will \nbe implemented. The government\u2019s efforts to secure early approval of customs, investment, and \ntax laws are welcome, which apart from the signaling effect would also bring immediate benefits \nfor trade and investment. \nFund  staff  recognizes  the  difficulties  of  amending  labor  legislation.  Staff  supports  the \nauthorities\u2019 intention to press ahead with the introduction of regulations that ensure a balanced \nframework for labor-business relations. The new regulations need to protect the rights of workers, \nwhile enhancing flexibility for business, in particular with regard to severance pay and outsourcing \nrequirements. More flexible labor markets will help Indonesia become more competitive vis-\u00e0-vis \nneighboring countries and should encourage employers to make hiring decisions more freely. \n ", "  Appendix 6  73 \nStatus of IMF Relations \n \n\u2022  Indonesia\u2019s  Extended  Arrangement  with  the  Fund  expired  in  December  2003.  It  was  \nfollowed by a close policy dialogue with the authorities through post-program monitoring \n(PPM) (until the recent repayment of all obligations to the Fund) and extensive technical \nassistance activities.  \n\u2022  The 2006 Article IV consultation and fifth PPM were completed on July 31. \n\u2022  The next Fund mission is scheduled for early December, and technical assistance missions \nfrom the Fiscal Affairs Department and the Monetary and Capital Markets Department will \nbe in the field during November. \n\u2022  The Fund welcomes Indonesia's early repayment of its obligations to the Fund. This is a \nreflection of the strength of the economy and especially, its balance of payments position. \nThe Fund expects to continue a constructive dialogue  with  the  Indonesian authorities \nthrough regular staff visits, technical assistance missions, and in the context of the annual \nArticle IV consultations, the next of which is scheduled for mid-2007. \n \n \n \n ", "74  Appendix 7 \nINELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n1.

Background \n \n1.  The lack of adequate preparation of public-private partnership (PPP) projects is one of the \nmost critical impediments affecting infrastructure development in Indonesia. While more than 90 \nprojects were offered to the private sector at the Indonesia Infrastructure Summit in January 2005, \nthe progress in actually implementing these projects has been disappointing. For example, no \nmore than six potential investors showed interest in any of the toll-road projects announced for \nprequalification;  frequently  the  number  has  been  between  zero  and  two.  The  absence  of \nadequate  and  reliable  technical  and  financial  information  on  PPP  projects,  particularly  any \ndetailed analysis of the various risks affecting them, has been the main reason for this low interest \nand contributed to the Government\u2019s unwillingness to provide any risk-sharing support. Without \nthe possibility of such support, reputable investors, especially international, continue to stay away.  \n \n2.  With recent enhancements to the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework introduced \nwithin the broader context of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-supported Infrastructure Reform \nSector  Development  Program,  a  more  supportive  environment  for  effective  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure development has been created. It is in particular the Presidential \nRegulation  (Perpres)  67/2005  on  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Infrastructure  Provision  that \nprovides  greater  certainty  to  private  investors  by  clearly  defining  the  rules  and  regulations. \nHowever,  large-scale  private  sector  participation  will  remain  constrained  in  the  absence  of \ncomprehensive and reliable information on PPP projects, and a clear attribution of project risks to \nparties that are most suitable to manage them. The Government\u2019s risk management framework, \nas outlined in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Decree 38/2006, deals with the latter. To address the \nlack  of  adequate  project  preparation,  which  also  hampers  effective  risk  allocation,  the \nGovernment asked ADB to support the establishment of an infrastructure project development \nfacility (PDF).1 The proposed Project has three components: \n \n(i)  PPP project preparation and transaction execution, which includes developing  \n \n(a)  a national component of the PDF (NPDF) to fund the preparation and \nbidding of large projects, mostly in power, toll-road and transport sectors; \nand  \n(b)  a regional component of the PDF (RPDF) to fund the preparation and \nbidding of smaller decentralized regional infrastructure projects.2  \n \n(ii)  technical  advisory  services  to  the  PDF  and  capacity  building  for  PPP  project \npromotion and execution; and \n \n(iii)  procurement and administrative services to the PDF.  \n                                                 \n1  The PDF will help address one of the most critical constraints. This needs to be supplemented by an effective \nenforcement of Perpres 67/2005 and other relevant regulations to create equal access for the private \nsector, and enhance judicial certainty and adherence to arbitration awards or outcomes of dispute \nresolution mechanisms. \n2  The Government\u2019s request for support dates back to 2001. A project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the \nprivate sector participation development facility was implemented from September 2002 to June 2003, the TA loan \nfact-finding and appraisal missions concluded their work in mid-2005, and all other steps were completed by October \n2005 in preparation for loan negotiations. However, in June 2006, the Government requested that the facility\u2019s focus, \nscope, and support be expanded to include the NPDF as well, and that the name of the facility be changed to \u201cRPDF\u201d \nto reflect the focus on regional decentralized projects, with the NPDF dedicated to national projects.   \n ", "76  Appendix 8 \n3.  Perpres  67/2005  provides  the  legal  framework  for  all  projects\u2014those  that  are  the \nresponsibility of the national Government, contracting agencies, and local governments. Hence, \nthe PDF will integrate the oversight, technical advisory, and procurement functions for national as \nwell as regional projects, which will result in efficiency gains and conserve resources. Based on \nthe Government\u2019s request, ADB proposes providing a loan of $30 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources. The Government of the Netherlands will provide grant cofinancing of \n$7.5 million, while the Government of Indonesia and concerned local governments will contribute \nthe remaining $7.8 million of the total cost of the PDF. \n \nB.  Project Description  \n \n1.  PPP Project Preparation and Transaction Execution \n \na.  NPDF \n   \n4.  Objective and Scope. The principal objective of the NPDF is to accelerate national PPP \nproject transactions. In line with Perpres 67/2005, the NPDF will provide funding for project \npreparation and transaction execution, leading to the conclusion of an appropriate contractual \narrangement for the project (i.e., PPP procurement).3 The subsequent project implementation will \nnot be financed from the NPDF. The NPDF will cover large national projects, with specific focus \non  the  power,  toll-road  and  selected  transport  subsectors.  The  extent  of  local  government \ninvolvement in these projects will be limited in comparison with the RPDF. Given the relatively low \naccess to infrastructure services in Indonesia, particularly of the poor, the NPDF will help the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction efforts by accelerating necessary investments and encouraging \nprivate  sector  participation,  which  in  turn  will  have  longer  term  multiplier  effects  on  poverty \nreduction. Further, the NPDF will alleviate acute capacity constraints within line ministries and \ncontracting agencies in preparing projects and selecting private sector partners.    \n \n5.  Functions. The key functions of the NPDF include \n \n(i)  providing support to the National Committee on the Acceleration of Infrastructure \nDevelopment (KKPPI) in evaluating potential PPP projects based on an objective \nidentification, screening, and prioritization system; \n(ii)  enhancing awareness of the private sector about PPP projects to solicit interest, \nestablish contacts with potential private project partners, and share information \nwith them, with the view to reducing the cost of infrastructure services through \ngreater competition; \n(iii)  contracting  out  consulting  and  PPP  transaction  advisory  services  in  an  open, \ntransparent, and competitive manner that is fully in line with the Government\u2019s \nprocurement regulations;4 \n(iv)  overseeing  the  preparation  of  prefeasibility  studies,  preliminary  design,  and \nspecifications for PPP projects;  \n(v)  providing support for the PPP procurement process, including all aspects such as \nbidding, negotiation, and contract award; and \n                                                 \n3  PPP procurement includes prequalification, bidding, negotiation, and signing of the concession agreement with the \nprivate sector partner (or other contractual arrangements such as management, leasing, and build-own-operate \ncontracts).  \n4  Presidential Decree 80/2003 on Public Procurement. The provisions of the decree, drafted under an ADB technical \nassistance, are in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Decree requires the establishment of a \nprocurement committee, which may comprise members from different line ministries and/or agencies to ensure good \ngovernance. \n ", "Appendix 8  77 \n \n(vi)  designing  a  sustainable  cost-recovery  scheme  to  ensure  that  the  project \npreparatory and transaction execution resources invested through the NPDF are \nrecouped  through  the  PPP  contractual  agreements,  and  that  a  legally  sound \ninstitutional and operational system is established for the NPDF and government \nbudget  system  to  reuse  the  recovered  resources  for  the  preparation  and \ntransaction execution of a continuing pipeline of projects. \n \n6.  Role. Project preparation and transaction advisory support will include  \n \n(i)  refining  and  strengthening  PPP  project  proposals,  and  preparing  a  project \nsummary and business plan (information memorandum) aimed at attracting private \nsector interest;  \n(ii)  identifying sources of technical services that can help prepare quality projects; \n(iii)  undertaking  a  thorough  prefeasibility  study  in  line  with  Perpres  67/2005  that \nincludes \n  \n(a)  preliminary technical design and specifications; \n(b)  analysis of PPP options leading to the optimum institutional structure to \nachieve financial closing, and to ensure successful project construction, \nmanagement, and operation; \n(c)  a comprehensive economic analysis; \n(d)  a comprehensive financial analysis, including tariff analysis and testing for \nproject robustness; \n(e)  detailed cost estimates and a financing plan;  \n(f)  design  of  a  sound  fiduciary  management  structure  for  the  project  that \npromotes transparency between the public and private partners in the PPP \ntransaction; \n(g)  a comprehensive procurement plan;  \n(h)  a  social  and  environmental  impact  analysis,  including  poverty,  land \nacquisition, resettlement, indigenous peoples, and environment; and \n(i)  assessment of any labor-related concerns or issues, particularly in the case \nof nongreenfield projects; and  \n \n(iv)  providing transaction execution services for PPP procurement including \n \n(a)  drafting or refining prequalification and bidding documents, and concession \nagreements (or other contractual arrangements [footnote 3]), which cover, \namong others, construction, input supply, output purchase, general project \nmanagement, and management and turnover of assets; \n(b)  prequalifying bidders; \n(c)  evaluating technical and financial proposals from prequalified bidders;  \n(d)  ensuring  that  principles  and  modalities  are  specified  in  the  concession \nagreement  for  arbitration  or  other  forms  of  dispute  resolution  that  are \napplicable within relevant laws to resolve any conflicts or disputes that may \narise between the contracting authority and the winning bidder; and \n(e)  undertaking  negotiations  with  the  preferred  bidder  and  finalizing  the \nconcession agreement. \n \n ", "78  Appendix 8 \n7.  Structure and Process. The NPDF will initially be established, together with the RPDF, \nas an advisory facility within the Government.5 Figure A8 presents the various steps involved in \nproject identification, prioritization, selection, preparation, and transaction execution; and shows \nhow the NPDF and RPDF are integrally involved in the process. The steps provide for adequate \nchecks and balances to ensure that BAPPENAS (the National Development Planning Agency), \nthe  Executing  Agency,  as  well  as  the  concerned  implementing  agencies  adhere  to  good \ngovernance principles in all aspects related to the PDF, including transparent decision-making on \nrequests  for  funding  from  the  NPDF  and  RPDF;  procurement  of  advisory,  consulting,  and \ntransaction-execution services; and oversight of the project preparation and transaction execution \nprocesses.  The  table  at  the  end  of  this  appendix  (Table  A8.4)  presents  a  checklist  of  the \nregulatory requirements for PPP projects. Once the decision is taken to provide preparatory and \ntransaction execution support from the national or regional component of the PDF, the checklist in \nTable A8.4 will form the basis for determining the level and scope of such support, as well as for \nthe subsequent decision-making on the PPP project by the KKPPI and MOF. \n \n8.  Project Pipeline and Selection. The KKPPI Secretariat maintains and regularly updates \na database on PPP project opportunities in the various infrastructure sectors, which represents \nthe potential project pipeline for the NPDF. In the July 2006 update, 75 national projects were \nlisted. About half were still at the preparation and prequalification stages, and hence suitable for \nNPDF funding. The other projects have already reached the bidding or contract award stage, but \nquestions on how many of these will actually materialize are being raised. The bidding was \nfrequently based on inadequate information such as outdated prefeasibility studies (or no studies \nat all), and the Government did not offer any risk sharing. For such failed projects, rebidding may \nbe needed after the project information, including risk analysis, has been improved, preferably \nwith the help of the NPDF.  \n \n9.  The power and toll-road sectors account for more than 70% of the country\u2019s infrastructure \nneeds. Yet, these are also the sectors where project preparation has not been given adequate \nresources. The NPDF is expected to finance the preparation and transaction execution for at least \n10 power, toll-road, as well as selected transport sector projects. The first two projects, preferably \none each for power and toll-roads, will be processed for the NPDF on a model basis. Lessons \nfrom other PPP projects prepared and executed outside the NPDF will be reviewed to refine the \nmodels. Parallel to that, a cost-recovery scheme may be formulated and adopted through which \nthe  Government  recoups  at  least  part  of  the  preparatory  and  execution  costs  from  project \nsponsors. Subject to the success of the cost-recovery scheme, the number of projects financed \nby the NPDF may be higher.  \n \n10.  As shown in Figure A8, the line ministries or contracting agencies will prioritize their \nprojects for funding under the NPDF. In doing so, they will use the prioritization criteria specified \nin the Government\u2019s Operational Guidelines Manual on the application of Perpres 67/2005. Given \nthe limited resources available, BAPPENAS will have to undertake the subsequent ranking and \nselection of projects for the NPDF in an objective and systematic manner, taking into account the \nfollowing: (i) inclusion of the proposed project in the concerned ministry or contracting agency\u2019s \nmaster plan and in the KKPPI database; (ii) quality of the demand forecast or other studies \nindicating the need for the project; (iii) a rapid preliminary assessment of the technical, economic, \nand  financial  prospects  of  the  project  vis-\u00e0-vis  other  candidates;  (iv)  private  sector  interest, \nincluding an assessment of the project\u2019s prospects, vis-\u00e0-vis other candidates, for attracting wide \n                                                 \n5  Law 1/2004 on the State Treasury allows the Government to establish Badan Layanan Umum or s that can act on \nbehalf of the Government.

These project selection criteria will be refined under the technical advisory \nservices and capacity-building component. \n \nb.  RPDF \n \n11.  Objective. The RPDF is to support local governments in preparing decentralized regional \ninfrastructure PPP projects effectively to increase private sector participation. The impact of the \nRPDF  will  be  improved  regional  living  conditions  and  economic  development  through  local \ninfrastructure development. The outcome will be to (i) increase private sector participation in \nregional infrastructure projects by enabling local governments to prepare bankable PPP projects, \nand (ii) disseminate and catalyze best practice in structuring and executing PPP transactions. The \nresulting projects will be ready for financing and implementation. They will also generate business \nand employment opportunities for a wide range of private sector participants across Indonesia. \n \n12.  Scope and Function. The demand assessment for the RPDF is based on 72 projects \nprioritized by financial viability and implementation capacity from 130 projects identified through \nconsultations with a number of local governments across the country. Financing structures for the \nprojects will vary but, based on experience to date, the large majority will be structured around a \nlocal investor contributing some equity, but majority-funded on a recourse basis by national \nfinancial institutions (probably commercial banks). The RPDF will facilitate linkages to investors \nand financial institutions. \n \n13.  The RPDF will provide funds to finance consulting services to help local governments \nprepare, bid, evaluate, negotiate, and award regional infrastructure PPP projects. It will support \nthe whole range of PPP options from concession, through build-operate-transfer and other forms \nof investment contracts, to management contracts. Local governments will be required to share \nthe costs of PPP project development in a manner that does not discourage initiatives in this area. \nThe  RPDF  will  only  be  available  to  local  governments  willing  to  comply  with  the  relevant \nguidelines  to  ensure  quality  transactions  that  are  prepared  efficiently  and  transparently, \ncompetitively tendered, and well implemented. Financing proportions will vary according to the \nphase of project preparation. \n \n ", "80  Appendix 8 \nFigure A8: Steps Involved in the Preparation and Execution of PPP Project \nTransactions \nProject Identification and Prioritization for  Project Preparation and Transaction \nFunding under the NPDF and RPDF  Execution \nStep 1: Project Identification and \nPrioritization (Line Ministries/Contracting  Step 5: Transaction Execution \nAgencies/Local Governments)  (Line Ministries/Contracting \n  Agencies/Local Governments) \n \n(cid:131) Identification and screening of the PPP project \n(cid:131) Public consultations in line with Perpres  (cid:131) With assistance of the PDF-funded \n67/2005  transaction advisers, bidding to select private \n(cid:131) Prioritization for preparatory and execution  sector partners, and execution of contractual \nsupport under the PDF using OGM screening  agreements \ncriteria   (cid:131) Reporting to the KKPPI Secretariat \n(cid:131) Preparation of the proposal request for the  (cid:131) Implementation of the PPP project \nsupport with detailed terms of reference for  (cid:131) Safeguards and statutory monitoring \nconsultants \n(cid:131) Submission of a funding request to the PDF for \nthe above support  \nStep 4: \nProject Preparation (Line \nMinistries/Contracting Agencies/Local \nStep 2: Assessment (PMU)  Governments with PMU Support)  \n   \n(cid:131) Review of compliance of the proposed  (cid:131) Recruitment of consultants and transaction \nPPP project with Perpres. 67/2005  advisers (can be combined or separated)  \n(cid:131) Assessment of its suitability for PDF  (cid:131) Monitoring of project preparation \nfunding, using predetermined selection  (cid:131) Quality assurance \ncriteria   (cid:131) Disbursement of progress payments \n(cid:131) Recommendation to the KKPPI Secretariat \nfor NPDF funding, subject to all selection \ncriteria met \n(cid:131) Recommendation to the working group for \nRPDF projects \nStep 3: Oversight/Approval  \n \n(cid:131) NPDF-funded projects will be approved by the deputy chairperson for infrastructure affairs of BAPPENAS, and \nreported at the next KKPPI ministerial meeting.

The sector coverage of the RPDF will include (i) water supply, (ii) wastewater treatment \nand  sanitation,  (iii)  solid  waste  management  and  disposal  facilities,  (iv)  passenger  transport \nterminals, (v) markets, (vi) regional government-owned airports and seaports, and (vii) other \nregional facilities as deemed appropriate by the RPDF steering committee. The RPDF is expected \nto finance the preparation and transaction execution of more than 40 such regional infrastructure \nprojects. Selection criteria include (i) approval of the PPP project by the head of the regional \ngovernment; (ii) demonstration of its potential to generate revenue sufficient to recover the capital \ncosts and cover all operating costs; (iii) written commitment from the regional government to \ncomply  with  applicable  national  laws,  regulations,  and  policies;  competitive  and  transparent \nprocesses;  and  all  relevant  environmental  and  social  safeguard  standards;  (iv)  written \ncommitment from the concerned regional government to provide in-kind contribution for project \npreparation  and  transaction  execution;  and  (v)  submission  of  satisfactory  evidence  that  the \nregional government\u2019s exposure to debt servicing resulting from the PPP project will be governed \nby all applicable national Government regulations. If a cost-recovery scheme is designed and \nsuccessfully implemented, the RPDF may support a larger number of decentralized projects.  \n \n2.  Technical Advisory Services and Capacity Building \n \n15.  This component will provide overall technical advisory services support to the project \nmanagement unit (PMU) (para. 21) to function effectively in operating the NPDF and RPDF. PMU \nsupport  will  include  (i)  refinement  of  selection  criteria  for  providing  funding  support;  (ii) \nassessment of requests for PDF funding from the line ministries, contracting agencies, and local \ngovernments; (iii) technical evaluation of proposals from consultants to be recruited for PPP \nproject preparation and transactions execution; (iv) linking PPP venture proponents with financial \ninstitutions  capable  of  funding  the  proposed  projects;  (v)  based  on  a  review  of  the  PPP \nprocurement  process  in  the  first  few  projects,  assessment  of  the  potential  institutional  and \ncorruption  risks  involved,  and  recommendations  on  strengthening  the  regulatory  framework, \nincluding amending Perpres 67/2005 as appropriate, to mitigate such risks; (vi) advisory support \nto  the  KKPPI  on  cross-cutting  policy  or  regulatory  measures  in  the  areas  of  anticorruption, \ntransparency, and dispute resolution that would elicit greater private sector participation; and (vii) \noverall PPP project promotion.  \n \n16.  The technical advisory services group will comprise an international PPP expert, who will \nbe recruited to provide full-time support to the PDF for 4 years. International legal expertise will be \nmobilized to support and advise the PMU on matters relating to PPP contractual arrangements \n(including  management,  leasing,  and  build-operate-transfer  contracts;  and  concession \nagreements) and transaction execution. The PMU will recruit several national experts to help with \nnational and regional PPP projects, and international experts in the sectors to be funded from the \nRPDF, such as water supply and sanitation, and small-scale regional infrastructure, to provide \nsupport to local governments. \n \n17.  Enhancing awareness of PPP projects is vital, particularly as the regulatory framework \n(Perpres 67/2006) is still relatively new. In particular, private sector participation in decentralized \nprojects  needs  to  be  promoted  for  which  most  local  governments  still  lack  the  necessary \nunderstanding. Continuous capacity building is also vital, both at the national and decentralized \nlevels. The capacity-building component will develop a training module for PMU staff, covering \nproject appraisal based on feasibility studies and other PPP project documents; and undertake \ntraining  for  stakeholders  of  regional  infrastructure,  covering  PPP  basics  and  best  practice, \npreparation of feasibility studies, guidelines for tariff setting in full cost-recovery projects, and \nfinancing  options  for  PPP  project  implementation.  The  capacity-building  component  will  also \n ", "82  Appendix 8 \nsupport advanced diploma or certificate study programs for government officials for specialized \ntraining and education opportunities in areas related to PPP projects. \n \n3.  Procurement and Administrative Services  \n \n18.  The role of this component is to help the PMU exercise its administrative and procurement \nfunctions for the PDF. The component will assist the PMU, as well as line ministries, contracting \nagencies,  and  local  governments,  in  refining  proposal  requests  (Figure  A8,  step  4).  All \nprocurement-related activities of the PMU will be handled under this component, including support \nto procurement teams formed under the NPDF and RPDF. In particular, procurement teams for \nregional projects will receive assistance in the consultant selection process. The support will also \ninclude coordinating the quality assurance process; seeking endorsement from line ministries, \ncontracting agencies, and local governments before payments are made to consultants and \ntransactions  advisers  recruited  under  the  PDF;  monitoring  and  managing  disbursements; \ndeveloping a database and information system to track all steps involved in project management, \nso that all relevant milestones and deliverables are met; monitoring and evaluating the Project; \nand managing the project funds.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n \n19.  Cost Estimates. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $38.8 million (Table A8.1). \nPPP  projects  under  the  NPDF  will  entail  a  higher  unit  cost  of  preparation  and  transaction \nexecution, given their larger scale. The allocation for RPDF would enable the preparation of a \nlarger number of decentralized PPP projects, which will be less resource intensive on a per-\nproject basis.  \n \n20.  Financing Plan. ADB will provide a loan of $26.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources. The Government of the Netherlands will provide $7.6 million in grant cofinancing. The \nGovernment of Indonesia will allocate staff and other resources in the equivalent of $4.7 million. \nTable A8.2 presents the financing plan.  \n \nTable A8.1: Cost Estimates for Project Development Facility  \n($ million) \n \nComponent and Description  Amount   %\nA.

Implementation and Procurement Arrangements \n \n21.  Implementation  Arrangements.  The  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n(BAPPENAS)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  head  of  the  Directorate  for  Public-Private \nPartnerships in BAPPENAS will be the overall project director for the PDF on behalf of the \nGovernment. The PMU to be established under the directorate will coordinate all three project \ncomponents. The PMU will be staffed by qualified personnel and host the technical advisers \nengaged under the second component who will assist in setting up and managing the PDF, \ntraining and capacity building of stakeholders, promoting the RPDF with local governments, and \nformulating a long-term strategy for the PDF. Each participating local government will establish a \nregional  unit,  which  will  be  supported  by  the  PMU  in  managing  the  RPDF-funded  project \npreparation  and  transaction  execution.  A  Project  Steering  Committee  (PSC),  chaired  by \nBAPPENAS Deputy Chairman for Infrastructure Affairs, will be established to serve as a high-\nlevel  decision-making  and  guiding  forum  for  NPDF  and  RPDF  and  will  comprise  senior \nrepresentatives of CMEA, MOF, Ministry of Home Affairs and the concerned line ministries, and a \nrepresentative of the associations of regional governments to participate as a resource person. \n \n22.  Sustainability of the PDF. Given the 5-year horizon of the PDF, ensuring continuity of the \ntechnical, procurement, and administrative support provided to the line ministries, contracting \nagencies, and local governments for project preparation and transaction execution is critical. The \nGovernment has agreed that these support functions will be gradually absorbed and continued by \nthe Central PPP Unit currently receiving assistance under two ongoing projects.6  \n________________________ \n6  ADB. 2005.  Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Support for Infrastructure Development. Manila \n(TA 4728-INO for $2 million, to be completed in late 2007), assists the BAPPENAS Secretariat of the KKPPI in a \nrange of areas including finalization and tracking of the Government\u2019s own reform program (the Infrastructure Policy \nPackage), formulating the policy framework for public service obligations, initial screening and identification of \nprojects, and preparation of information memorandums for selected projects. The World Bank loan-financed Private \nParticipation in Infrastructure Technical Assistance ($17 million, approved in 2002, to be completed in early 2007) is \nproviding advisory support on legal and regulatory issues to the KKPPI and selected line ministries, and in evaluating \nand finalizing project proposals. \n ", "84  Appendix 8 \n23.  Procurement Arrangements. The PMU will coordinate all procurement arrangements, as \noutlined in para. 91 of the main text and below (Table A8.3). The sample request for proposals \nwill be modified by the concerned line ministries, local governments, or contracting agencies and \nsubmitted for review and approval in line with the steps outlined in Figure A8.

All procurement of goods and services under the Project will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. Recruitment of consulting services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n ", "  Appendix 8  85 \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, including the use of simplified technical proposals and \nquality- and cost-based system for selection of consulting firms. \n \n25.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with \nthe Executing Agency. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and \nthe bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n26.  Disbursement Arrangements. To facilitate project implementation, the Government will \nestablish an imprest account to finance eligible small expenditures. The imprest account will be \nsolely for project purposes and will be established at Bank Indonesia (BI). The account will be \nestablished, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2001) and detailed arrangements agreed between the Government and ADB. The \nceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  $40,000  and  liquidation  will  be  carried  out  under  the \nstatement of expenditures (SOE) procedure for which the limit will be $10,000. ADB will disburse \nthe remainder of the TA loan in accordance with direct payment procedures as described in \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The Royal Netherlands Embassy in Indonesia will provide \ncounterpart funds for ADB to administer and these funds will be disbursed as described above. \n \n27.  Accounting, Auditing and Reporting. The Government will ensure the maintenance of \nrecords and accounts to adequately identify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. \nThe PMU will be responsible for the implementation of the Project including project supervision, \nmonitoring, accounting, and reporting. Based upon BI reports, the PMU will provide ADB with \nconsolidated semiannual reports on project implementation (i.e., progress on commitments and \ndisbursements, preparation status of the PPP projects, problems encountered, and actions taken \nto remedy the problems, and expected progress during the following half year). The EA will have \nimprest  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors \nwhose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB, in accordance \nwith provisions of the Loan Agreement, and as specified in the Guidelines for the Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank. \nSOE records will be audited as part of the annual audit. The PMU will submit to ADB certified \ncopies (in English) of such audited accounts and financial statements, and the related reports of \nthe auditors, within 6 months after the close of each financial year. A separate audit opinion on \nthe use of the imprest account and SOE procedures should be included in the annual report. All \nother reports will be submitted in English according to an agreed timetable. The Project will be \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s guidelines on the prevention of fraud and corruption.  \n \n28.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. To ensure that PPP projects are \nprepared effectively and that their benefits are maximized, a project performance monitoring \nsystem (PPMS) will be developed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management \nSystem (PPMS) Handbook and project objectives. The PPMS will assist the PMU in monitoring \nfacility inputs, progress in assistance, outcomes, and impacts. Indicators of capacity building and \ninformation dissemination for government agencies, financial institutions, potential investors, and \nother stakeholders will be incorporated in the design of the system to facilitate the monitoring and \nevaluation of project benefits. Data collection for the PPMS will be undertaken by the PMU and \nregional governments. \n ", "86  Appendix 8 \n29.  Project Review. ADB and the Government will jointly undertake annual reviews of the \nProject to assess progress and identify constraints and ways to address identified constraints. \nSuch reviews will commence 6 months following loan effectiveness to enable the Executing \nAgency to make adjustments in the project design and implementation arrangements as needed. \nThe review will cover the (i) status of PPP project preparation and transaction execution; (ii) \nperformance of the consultants under the three project components; and (iii) possible changes in \nproject scope, implementation arrangements and allocation of loan proceeds. A midterm review \nwill be conducted within 3 years of loan effectiveness. \n \nD.  Environmental and Social Measures \n \n30.  The PDF will not finance any investments in project implementation, as it will support only \nthe preparation of pre- or full feasibility studies and PPP procurement up to the signing of the \nconcession agreement (or other contractual arrangements). Requests for any subsequent ADB \nfinancing for project investments will be dealt with separately, and will be subject to all of ADB\u2019s \nrequirements, particularly with regard to environmental and social safeguards. As ADB financing \nis not assumed at the project preparation stage, the PDF will not be able to enforce ADB\u2019s \ndetailed  safeguard  policies.  However,  the  principles  of  these  policies  are  reflected  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  existing  procedures.  Environmental  and  social  impact  assessment,  including \nissues of involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples, will be integral components in the \npreparation of PPP projects to be supported by the PDF. For projects funded from the PDF, \nenvironmental assessments will be undertaken and review procedures developed in compliance \nwith the Government\u2019s own existing regulations, and in broad accordance with principles and \nobjectives  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  and  Operations  Manual  Section  F1: \nEnvironmental Considerations in ADB Operations. Social safeguard (involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples) assessments will be also be undertaken in accordance with the current \ngovernment regulations. In the event that ADB financing is sought for project implementation, \nadditional assessments may have to be carried out in line with the principles and objectives of \nADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples as outlined in Handbook on \nPoverty and Social Analysis, and Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. As the \nprogram loan component of the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program aims to \nreduce the gaps between the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s requirements, it is envisaged that there \nwill be convergence in the scope of the feasibility studies in these areas over the duration of the \nPDF. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  87 \nTable A8.4: Legal and Regulatory Requirements and Criteria for PPP Projects \n \nCompliance \nNo.  REQUIREMENT/CRITERION \nFull  Partial None\n  A.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Committee on Policy for the Acceleration of \nInfrastructure Development (KKPPI) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical \nassistance (TA) to increase private sector participation in the provision of infrastructure. The TA \nwill  support  MOF  in  determining  and  providing  risk-sharing  support  to  private  investors  in \ninfrastructure projects, and designing and establishing infrastructure financing mechanisms. For \nthe  KKPPI,  which  has  overall  responsibility  for  coordinating  the  preparation,  bidding,  and \ncontracting of public-private partnership (PPP) projects, the TA will provide support in effective \ncommunications on and social marketing of infrastructure reforms. The TA has four components. \n \nB.  Scope \n \n1.  Risk Management \n2.  Fiscal prudence has been the Government\u2019s overarching principle and foundation for \nmacroeconomic management since the Asian financial crisis. While this prudence has served \nIndonesia well by reducing public debt from more than 100% of gross domestic product (GDP) to \nabout 45% in 2005 and containing fiscal deficit from more than 2.5% of GDP in the early 2000s to \n0.5%, it did impede development spending. Bearing in mind the adverse outcomes of the precrisis \npractice of open-ended assurances through \u201ccomfort letters\u201d to well-connected private investors, \nthe fiscal prudence has also translated into a very cautious stance by the Government with regard \nto any fiscal support to the private sector, particularly in large and risky projects with revenue \nflows spread over a long period. With macroeconomic stability regained, the Government is taking \na more proactive stance with an increasing realization that investors will not come unless some \nform  of  assurance  is  given  by  the  public  sector.  To  attract  badly  needed  private  sector \ninvestments in infrastructure, MOF issued Decree 38/2006 on Risk Mitigation and Management in \nInfrastructure Provision that sets out the criteria for determining the Government\u2019s fiscal support, \nboth cash and noncash.  \n \n3.  The various forms of risk-sharing support that the Government could provide include \ncoinvestments in PPP projects to meet their upfront needs (e.g., for land acquisition); fiscal \nincentives such as tax-holidays or tax exemptions; subsidies; and event-dependent guarantees. \nMOF needs help in assessing the type and level of risk-sharing support required to accelerate \ninfrastructure provision.  \n \n4.  The goal of this component is to help enhance the capacity of the Risk Management Unit \n(RMU) in MOF through on-the-job training and analysis of risk-sharing support for specific PPP \ninfrastructure transactions. The tasks include the following: \n \n(i)  Determine the type of government support that should be provided at sector and \nproject levels. \n(ii)  Establish, from a prudent macroeconomic management point of view, overall caps \non the risk-sharing support that the Government can provide. \n(iii)  Evaluate specific project proposals for risk-sharing support that are passed on by \nthe KKPPI to MOF, decide whether or not to provide such support; and determine \nthe caps on its direct and contingent portions. \n ", "  Appendix 9  89 \n(iv)  Liaise with the transactions advisers appointed by line ministries and contracting \nagencies to learn the financial structure and technical details of the projects in the \npipeline that are likely to be submitted to the RMU. \n(v)  Advise the KKPPI to ensure that the Government\u2019s support is the least possible but \nrealistic enough to attract investments. \n(vi)  Based on quantitative and qualitative analyses (including evaluations of sector \npolicies  and  priorities;  demand  for  services  being  provided;  structure  of  the \nproposed transaction, etc.), recommend the type and size of the fiscal support for \neach transaction. \n(vii)  Evaluate the risk-sharing arrangements between national, provincial, and district \ngovernments, and help MOF allocate optimal sharing of overall obligations for \nhigh-priority projects. \n(viii)  Advise on the establishment and structure of a guarantee fund, and formulate the \nstandard operating procedures anchored on fiscal prudence and good governance. \n(ix)  Estimate the annual budgetary allocations required to meet the promised fiscal \nsupport, and the potential drawdown from the guarantee fund. \n(x)  Monitor and assess the overall financial obligations created by the Government\u2019s \ndecisions. \n(xi)  Support MOF and KKPPI in justifying MOF\u2019s decisions, exposure caused, and \noutcomes to other stakeholders including Parliament, and develop an effective \nstrategy for such interfaces. \n(xii)  Advise relevant MOF officials on reporting the risk-sharing support provided in line \nwith government accounting standards.  \n(xiii)  Based on these activities, advise MOF on reformulating the risk management and \noverall debt management strategy, whenever necessary.   \n \n5.  Expertise Needed and Duration of Advisory Support. This TA component has to be \nimplemented in a flexible manner, given that the need for advisory support will be contingent on \nthe pace at which project transactions are submitted to MOF. Figure A9 illustrates the expertise \nneeded and the indicative duration of support. Implementation will be divided into two phases.  \n \n(i)  Phase 1 (3 months). The experts will establish contact with officials in MOF and \nKKPPI; formulate a detailed work plan; agree with MOF officials on their functions \nand responsibilities; begin to build up basic capacity in the RMU team based on \nthe initial transactions that the team will evaluate; and demonstrate how in-depth \nassessments are made and decisions reached through actual project transactions. \nThe experts will discuss the needs for their field presence in phase 2 and work out \na clear plan for continuous remote access and interface with the relevant MOF and \nother ministry officials during their absence. \n(ii)  Phase 2 (15 months). This phase will be implemented in a flexible manner with \nregard to the retainer experts, to give time for projects to be prepared, considered \nby the KKPPI, and submitted to the RMU for risk-sharing support. The experts may \nspend part of this phase in Indonesia, while the remaining part will be spent on a \nretainer basis at their home offices or through visits to Indonesia as needed, so \nthat they can provide continuous support to government officials.     \n \n ", "90  Appendix 9 \nFigure A9: Expertise to Be Provided Under the First Component to the Risk \nManagement Unit of the Ministry of Finance \nCore Team  Retainer Team \nRisk management experts in the \nRisk management adviser and  power sector (international, 8 \nteam coordinator (international, 18  person-months intermittent; \nperson-months continuous)  national, 12 person-months) \nRisk management expert (national, \n18 person-months) \nRisk management experts in toll \nroads (international, 8 person-\nmonths intermittent; national, 12 \nRisk management legal expert \nperson-months intermittent) \n(national, 12 person-months) \n \n \n2.  Establishment of a Sound Fiduciary Framework for Fund Management  \n \n6.  The Government is contemplating establishing various funding mechanisms to support \nPPP projects, including an Indonesia infrastructure fund, a guarantee fund, and a revolving fund \nfor land acquisition. While the institutional mechanisms for these funds are being formulated, the \nDirectorate  General  of  Treasury  in  MOF  is  expected  to  oversee  their  establishment  and \nmonitoring from a fiduciary point of view. This TA component will support MOF in designing and \nestablishing a sound fund management structure. An international funds management adviser \nand a national funds management expert will be recruited on an individual basis for about 10 \nperson-months each. Their tasks will include the following: \n \n(i)  Advise the Directorate General of Treasury on the optimal management structures, \nconsistent with Indonesian regulations and international best practices, for the \nvarious funds. \n(ii)  Design the necessary monitoring, operation, and financial reporting systems within \nMOF for the various funds. \n(iii)  Formulate, in consultation with the line agencies responsible for conceptualizing or \nestablishing the funds, the standard operating procedures for interfacing with MOF.  \n(iv)  Prepare an operations manual for the various funds for use in MOF and other \nagencies concerned. \n \n3.  Reform Communication and Social Marketing \n7.  The Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program covers nine sectors, spanning \nthe jurisdiction of close to 20 line ministries, agencies and regulatory bodies, and a large number \nof state-owned enterprises, and consists of many actions and outputs. Given the complexity and \n ", "  Appendix 9  91 \npolitical sensitivity of reforms, for instance in regulatory arrangements or cost recovery, their \nrationale must be clearly communicated both within and outside the Government. Without this, the \nrisk is considerable that the reforms may not be understood well by the general public, or even \nthe  concerned  government  officials.  An  international  communications/social  marketing  expert \nengaged for 4 person-months will support the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA), \nwhich acts as the KKPPI Secretariat, in designing a communication strategy. He/she will be \nassisted by a national expert engaged for 10 person-months. Tasks will include the following: \n \n(i)  Help  the  KKPPI  identify  sensitive reform  initiatives  that  need  to  be effectively \ncommunicated to stakeholders, both within and outside the Government. \n(ii)  Design communication strategies that can be modified and replicated for different \ntypes of reforms and stakeholders, integrating lessons from other countries and \ngood communication practices adopted elsewhere. \n(iii)  Advise the KKPPI if such communication has not worked in other countries and, if \nso, explore with the concerned line ministries/agencies (through the KKPPI) what \nchanges if any can be made in modifying the presentational aspects or timing of \nthe reform initiatives.    \n(iv)  Design communication materials for at least two important and sensitive reform \nareas, and disseminate them through effective channels. \n \n4.  Support  for  Preliminary  Technical  Preparations  under  the  Project \n  Development Facilities  \n8.  The  project  loan  will help  accelerate  PSP  in  infrastructure  sectors by  supporting  the \nestablishment of an infrastructure project development facility (PDF). The PDF will alleviate one of \nthe most critical constraints impeding infrastructure development, namely, the lack of adequate \nproject preparation. This TA component will help finalize technical preparations for the PDF so as \nto ensure quality at entrance and readiness of the PDF to work effectively. An international project \nmanagement specialist and a national procurement specialist engaged for 5 months will support \nthe Directorate for Public-Private Partnerships in BAPPENAS, which acts as the overall project \ndirectorate for the PDF on behalf of the Government, in preparing start up documentation for each \nproject proposal. Their tasks will include the following: \n \n(i)  Help the Directorate conduct demand surveys for selected projects, and collect \nbaseline data for these; \n(ii)  Prepare standard (pre-)feasibility study, bidding and contract documentation for the \nPDF; \n(iii)  Develop public campaign kits and conduct public information and communication \nactivities and workshops; \n(iv)  Consult with national and local governments on the suggested implementation \narrangements for the PDF and finalize detailed arrangements thereafter; and \n(v)  Prepare the project organizational setup in BAPPENAS. \n \n \nC.  Implementation and Reporting Arrangements \n \n9.  Implementation. The executing agencies will be \n \n(i)  the RMU under the newly established Fiscal Policy Office in MOF for the risk \nmanagement component; \n(ii)  Directorate General for Treasury in MOF for the funds management component;  \n ", "92  Appendix 9 \n(iii)  CMEA represented by the deputy for infrastructure for the reform communication \nand social marketing component; and \n(iv)  Directorate for Public-Private Partnerships in BAPPENAS for quality at entrance of \nthe PDF. \n \n10.  Recruitment. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants.  Given  the  complexity  of  risk  management  and  since  the  extent  of  the \nadvisory  services  will  depend  on  the  emerging  pipeline  of  infrastructure  projects,  the \nimplementation arrangements for the first component will be kept flexible. If a firm can provide the \nretainer type of services in a flexible manner without increasing the cost significantly, then a firm \nwill be recruited. Otherwise, the core team will be recruited initially on an individual basis, and the \nteam coordinator will be responsible for recruiting the retainer team and formulating a work plan to \nutilize their services depending on the risk assessment needs for specific projects. Further, as \nsuch needs may evolve and change during TA implementation, the allocation of person-months \nfor the first component is indicative only. If the Government and ADB feel that consultants should \ninitially be recruited for a shorter duration to meet specific needs, with resources reserved for \nfuture emerging needs, such an approach will be adopted. The consultants under the second and \nthird components will be recruited on an individual basis.  \n \n11.  Reporting  Arrangements.  The  team  leaders  for  the  respective  components  will \ncoordinate the reporting arrangements. Inception, mid-contract, and final reports will be prepared \nfor all components. Emphasis will be on technical content rather than administrative aspects, \ndescribing the advice provided to the Government in simple terms. Operational guidelines or \nmanuals should be comprehensive and final versions should be prepared with stakeholder inputs. \nIn addition, technical briefs will be prepared by consultants on a needs basis. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n12.  Table  A9  presents  an  indicative  allocation  of  the  TA  resources  across  the  four \ncomponents. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,500,000. The Government has asked \nADB  to  finance  $2,000,000  on  a  grant  basis,  with  the  rest  to  be  provided  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart support by the concerned executing agencies. Most of this support is expected to be \nin the form of government staff inputs, which are already factored into the regular work plans.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  93 \nTable A9: Cost Estimates for Technical Assistance for Enhancing Infrastructure Provision \n \n    Unit Cost  Total Cost \n  Item   Unit  ($ '000) \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nInfrastructure development and economic growth are strongly linked. Greater provision of infrastructure and related \nservices has a particularly beneficial impact on the poor by, for instance, improving access to markets and areas with \ngreater economic and employment opportunities. For the poor, in particular, improved water supply and sanitation; \nrural electrification; and better community and subdistrict infrastructure can have tremendous beneficial impacts.  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s poor investment climate and major deficiencies in infrastructure provision have been identified as key \nconstraints to growth. Infrastructure progress has virtually been at stand-still since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Due \nto lack of adequate investment for maintenance, the quality of existing infrastructure has worsened. In particular, the \ndeterioration of water supply and sanitation infrastructure and transport networks (roads, railways and sea transport) \nhas led to a lower quality of life for the poor. For instance, a large majority of the population (an estimated 210 million) \nliving outside of urban areas does not have access to sewerage systems.  \n \nThe constraints that affect growth and impede poverty reduction are characterized by \n \n\u2022  poor service coverage outside of Java, in general in all infrastructure sectors; where some services are \navailable, the quality is low, disjointed, and unreliable; \n\u2022  regional disparities in the availability of public sector resources and weaknesses in legal and institutional \nframeworks curtailing investment; and \n\u2022  failure to meet public service obligations (PSOs) by many state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and lack of a \nconsistent approach across the sectors in this regard. \n \nAny tariff adjustment would inevitably have an impact on the poor. Nonetheless, tariffs must be in line with cost-\nrecovery principles to ensure adequate quantity and quality of infrastructure services. In one major area, namely oil \nprices, the Government recently reduced subsidies, as these subsidies never benefited the poor (given that the middle \nclass consumed the most). Given the large and direct impact through the general rise in inflation following the increase \nin oil prices in 2005, the Government designed and implemented a credible compensation program. A medium-term \nexpenditure program, with efficient public expenditure reorientation, is being designed. The 2006 budget already \nreflects large reallocations to pro-poor programs. \n \nAnother major constraint entails land acquisition for infrastructure projects. The Presidential Regulation (Perpres) \n36/2005, as amended through Perpres 65/2006, provides a good framework for land acquisition. Implementing \nregulations are being drafted, aimed to bring the Indonesian legal requirements on livelihood restoration, consultation, \ngrievance redressal, and rights of squatters in alignment with those of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). For the \nfinancing for land acquisition, particularly for toll-road projects, the need for the Government to provide public \ninvestment support, given the cost as well as implementation difficulties in acquiring land, is becoming clearer. A \nbalanced regulatory framework is critical to guide such public investments and safeguard the interests of those likely \nto be affected.    \n \nThe Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (IRSDP) adopts a comprehensive approach to deal with all of \nthese issues over the medium-term. Given the complexity of reforms, a program cluster framework is adopted to \nsupport infrastructure development in a phased manner. The primary objective of the IRSDP is to improve the \ninvestment climate, and thereby boost economic growth and reduce poverty.  \n \nOverall, IRSDP implementation will have a net beneficial impact on poverty reduction. Besides addressing the \nimmediate quality of life concerns (through, for instance, leveraging improved provision of water supply and sanitation \nservices), the IRSDP will enhance access and employment opportunities for the poor by 2010. Decentralized \ninfrastructure projects, particularly the model PPPs to be pursued under subcomponents 2 and 3, will help in direct job \ncreation. The proposed project development facility will have a direct positive impact by designing such projects. \n \nIn parallel with the IRSDP, the Government is implementing the Rural Infrastructure Strengthening Program (also \nsupported by ADB through the Rural Infrastructure Support Project, approved in December 2005), which gives special \nattention to infrastructure needs in poorer and disadvantaged regions of Indonesia. \n ", "  Appendix 10  95 \nB.  Poverty Analysis                              Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe IRSDP directly supports implementation of the Government\u2019s programs on poverty reduction. In particular, the \nmeasures in the IRSDP have close linkages with (i) the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS); (ii) the Poverty \nPartnership Agreement between the Government ADB, and elements of the NPRS supported under the agreement; \nand (iii) the Government\u2019s medium-term development plan (RPJM) with its clear poverty reduction targets of halving \npoverty from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% in 2009.   \n \nSome noteworthy features of the linkages between the IRSDP actions and the NPRS include the following:  \n \n\u2022  The IRSDP focuses on enhancing private sector participation in NPRS implementation through broad-ranging \nmeasures, by strengthening the overall investment climate, and other supplementary reforms that are \nundertaken in coordination with projects supported by ADB and other development partners.  \n\u2022  Measures for mobilizing public and private sector resources for immediate and long-term infrastructure \ndevelopment will have significant effects on poverty reduction. \n\u2022  The  focus  on  risk-sharing  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  will  help  meet  the  demand  for \ninfrastructure needed to provide basic services and attract productive investments to generate employment.  \n \nIndicative links between IRSDP actions and the NPRS are shown in the following table. \n \nLinks between the National Poverty Reduction Strategy  \nand the Infrastructure Reform Program  \nNational Poverty  Infrastructure Reform Program Policy Actions \nReduction Strategy  \nMacroeconomic Stability \nPrudent fiscal  \u2022  Reduce subsidies to non-poor, and evaluate administered prices. \nmanagement  \u2022  Attract PSP in infrastructure development in commercially viable sectors, and \nconserve public sector resources for increasing health and education spending. \nBasic Rights    \nBasic services such as  \u2022  Provide direct support for water supply and sanitation projects. \nhealth, education, and  \u2022  Conserve public sector resources for essential social sector needs. \nwater supply; access to  \u2022  Adopt an overall framework for public service obligations (PSOs), leading to \ndecent work; and  harmonized treatment and provisions for PSOs across all infrastructure sectors. \nreduction of regional  \u2022  Develop a clear legal framework in each infrastructure sector governing PSOs.   \ninequalities \n \nPoverty Partnership Implementation Mechanism \nPrivate sector to play a  \u2022  Provide foremost emphasis on designing and strengthening public-private \nrole in investment,  partnerships in all infrastructure sectors. \nproduction, and   \ndistribution of goods and \nservices; generate taxes; \ncreate jobs and \ninfrastructure; and \nprovide access to assets \n  and technology \nC.
