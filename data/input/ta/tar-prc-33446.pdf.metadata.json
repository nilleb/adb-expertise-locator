INTRODUCTION\n1. During the 2000 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),\nthe Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) to\nprepare national strategies for soil and water conservation. This report is based on an ADB fact-\nfinding mission that visited the PRC from 21-26 August 2000 to confirm with the Government\nthe objective, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements of the\nTA.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. In 1998, the largest floods in the past 50 years on the Nen, Songhua and Yangtze rivers\ncaused massive property damage (more than $20 billion) and extensive loss of life. Dust storms\nin April-May 2000 affected a wide area, including Beijing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Nanjing, as well as\nwide swathes of Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Xinjiang provinces. Nature and human\nexistence in the PRC are far from being in a state of benign harmony, exacerbated by a legacy\nof mismanagement of land resources. Among all the natural and manmade disasters, land\ndegradation  (including  water  and  wind  erosion,  chemical  deterioration,  and  physical\ndeterioration) is the most intractable. Of the total territorial area of 9.6 million square kilometers\nkm2, soil erosion affects 3.67 million km2, or 38 percent of the national territory.2 Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) data show a slightly higher figure (4.66 million km2) for all forms\nof land degradation in the PRC.3 Land degradation affects most provinces.4 Annual soil loss is\nestimated at 5 billion tons (t). Economic damage is difficult to estimate,5 but the annual loss from\nusing land beyond its sustainable capacity is huge.\n3. Land degradation is mostly due to poor land use decisions over a long period of time,\nrather than climate change or other natural factors. In the PRC, per capita arable land is 0.11\nhectares. The shrinking arable land area pressures farmers to extract higher yields from their\nland leading to increased soil erosion. Almost 90 percent of rural people living in poverty are\nlocated  in  areas  suffering  from  soil  erosion.  In  arid  areas,  increasing  livestock  numbers\nexacerbate the spread of deserts. Over 90 percent of the 1.3 million km2 of grasslands suffer\nfrom moderate to severe degradation, while demand for meat and other livestock products is\nrising.\n4. For the past 50 years, the Government and the people have been battling to implement\nsoil and water conservation.6 By the end of 1998, 780,000 km2 had been comprehensively\ntreated, 180,000 programs for soil and water conservation were approved, and 36,000 cases of\nviolation against soil and water conservation laws and regulations investigated. In 1999, the\nMinistry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR)  prepared  a  50-year  master  plan  for  soil  and  water\nconservation, approved by the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC), and a five-\nyear action plan (2001-2005). The national Water and Soil Conservation Law 1991 has led to\nalmost all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions issuing implementation regulations\nand instructions on collecting fees to cover the costs of erosion control facilities and works, as\nwell as appropriate institutional arrangements. National regulations also cover erosion control\n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the Internet version of the ADB Business Opportunities on 25 August 2000.\n2  The statistics are unreliable. The China Statistical Yearbook (1999) gives an equivalent figure of 1.8 million km2, but\nthis is believed to exclude wind erosion.\n3  Lynden, G.W.J. and L. R. Oldeman. 1997.

Since 1990, steps to control desertification include development of the National Planning\nProgram for the Control of Desertification 1991-2000 and the National Action Plan for the\nControl of Desertification, and establishment of the Chinese Research and Development Center\nfor Control of Desertification, as well as several training and monitoring centers. To counter\ndifferent types of desertification, the Government focused on 20 major counties, in which 9\nexperimental areas and 22 experimental and demonstration bases were established. From 1991\nto 1995, 4.29 million hectares were brought under control, of which 1.22 million hectares were\nsubject to sandy land enclosure,7 afforestation, and grass planting. Another 470,000 hectares\nwere subject to sandy land control, cultivation, and low-yield farmland transformation.\n6. In 1999, 10 cities, 100 counties, and 1,000 small watersheds were selected for soil and\nwater conservation demonstration projects. In that year, 50,000 km2 were brought under control,\nbringing the total controlled area to 830,000 km2. Despite these achievements, at the current\npace it will take 60-70 years to completely restore degraded lands throughout the PRC. More\nthan 100,000 workers, 6,000 scientists, and 100 research institutes are engaged in water and\nsoil conservation work. The 1998 National Plan on the Ecological Environment considers water\nand soil conservation as one of the main rehabilitation tasks and a fundamental measure for\nriver control. The plan\u2019s goal is to bring soil erosion under preliminary control within 15 years,\nand permanent control within 30 years. The Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001-2005) places high\npriority  on  water  and  soil  conservation,  especially  in  the  western  PRC,  which  suffers  the\ngreatest  extent  of  soil  erosion.  In  addition  to  a  nationwide  logging  ban,  the  State  Forest\nAdministration (SFA) has announced plans to double the forest coverage from 13.9 percent to\n27 percent over the next 50 years, involving 1,100 counties in 24 provinces.\n7. A wide range of externally assisted projects related to soil and water conservation have\nbeen undertaken in the PRC. Apart from ADB, the sources of external assistance include FAO,\nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  World  Bank,  and  the  World  Food\nProgramme; providers of bilateral assistance include Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, and\nUnited  Kingdom.  The  World  Bank  has  completed  the  first  Loess  Plateau  Watershed\nRehabilitation Project ($150 million) and the second phase ($150 million) is being conducted\nfrom 1998 to 2003. The China-Japan Cooperation on Combating Desertification started in the\n1980s. The German Government has been supporting the Shelterbelt Development of the\nUpper and Middle Yangtze River and the Three Norths Shelterbelt Development Programme\nsince 1995. The National Action Program to Combat Desertification has received support from\nUNDP and is now receiving support from the Global Mechanism of the Convention to Combat\nDesertification.\n8. ADB projects relevant to the TA include Northeast Flood Damage Rehabilitation in Jilin\nand Heilongjiang provinces, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region;8 Fujian Soil Conservation\nand Rural Development;9 Strategic Options for the Water Sector;10 Soil and Water Conservation\nin the Upper Yangtze River Basin;11 Monitoring and Management of Fragile Ecosystems in\nShanxi,  Shaanxi,  and  Inner  Mongolia;12  Policies  and  Strategies  for  the  Sustainable\nDevelopment  of  the  Lancang  River  Basin;13  and  Yellow  River  Flood  Management  Sector\n                                                \n7 Sandy land enclosure and sandy land control involve establishing a checkerboard pattern of trees and straw to\nreduce the wind velocity at ground level, sufficiently to allow vegetative cover to grow and persist.\n8 Loan 1685, 1686, 1687-PRC, for $330 million, approved on 22 April 1999.\n9 Loan 1386-PRC, for $65 million, approved on 28 September 1995.\n10 TA 2817-PRC, for $1,180,000, approved on 26 June 1997.\n11 TA 3069-PRC, for $99,000, approved on 16 September 1998.\n12 TA 1615-PRC, for $600,000, approved on 27 November 1991.\n13 TA 3139-PRC, for $660,000, approved on 22 December 1998.", "3\nProject.14 However, to date no external financing has been available to support development of\na national strategy for soil and water conservation.\n9. Land degradation threatens (i) the ability of the PRC to feed its population; (ii) life,\nproperty, and infrastructure from landslides, mudslides, shifting dunes, and floods; (iii) urban\npopulations and transportation from increasingly frequent sand and dust storms; (iv) reservoir\nfunctions such as hydroelectricity, irrigation supplies, and flood detention; and (v) continued\nprogress in poverty reduction, as arable land shrinks and water supplies dry up. Recognizing\nthese threats and the inadequacy of past control strategies, and encouraged by the scenario\nplanning approach adopted by TA 2817 (which recommended this follow-up TA as a priority\nproject), the Government requested ADB assistance with formulating new strategies for soil and\nwater conservation. Earlier strategy plans developed by the Government did not attempt to\nrelate possible future social, economic, and environmental conditions with the selection of\nappropriate strategies for soil and water conservation, nor did they make the explicit linkage with\npoverty reduction strategies. The TA will remedy these inadequacies.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n10. The TA will address soil and water conservation in a comprehensive manner, rather than\nthe narrow demarcations under existing institutional arrangements, and map out a strategic\napproach to control all forms of land degradation throughout the PRC. The TA\u2019s objective is to\nassist the Government in developing national strategies for soil and water conservation. The TA\nwill help to improve land and water resources management, and will contribute to poverty\nreduction and economic development. The relationships between the TA\u2019s goals, objectives,\nrisks, and assumptions are shown in the TA framework in Appendix 1.\nB. Scope\n11. The TA will identify the extent and severity of land degradation throughout the PRC,\nassess past soil and water conservation projects to determine the lessons learned, evaluate\nalternative  options  to  accelerate  rehabilitation  and  protection  of  land,  identify  appropriate\ninternational models that can be applied to soil and water conservation projects in the PRC,\nrecommend a pipeline of priority projects for future investment (studied at the prefeasibility study\nlevel), and design a progress monitoring and evaluation system.\n12. In addition to the ADB projects (para. 8), the TA will take into account the relevant\nfindings of the following ADB-funded TAs: Study on Ways to Support Rural Poverty Reduction\nProjects;15 Policy Support for the PRC 2020 Project, Phase III,16 and other relevant studies. The\nTA will be complementary to, and provide an overarching strategic framework for, simultaneous\nADB-funded TAs on (i) Combating Desertification in Asia,17 (ii) Optimization of Initiatives to\nCombat Desertification in Gansu Province,18 and (iii) GEF Operational Program 12 Partnership\non Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems.19\n13. Document current status of soil erosion and land degradation. The TA team will\ndocument  the  current  status  of  land  degradation  (wind  and  water  erosion,  chemical,  and\nphysical deterioration), consistent with international norms. Where national statistics appear to\n                                                \n14 TA 3259-PRC, for $930,000, approved on 22 September 1999.\n15 TA 3150-PRC, for $715,000, approved on 31 December 1998.\n16 TA 3648-PRC, for $900,000, approved on 14 July 2000.\n17 TA 5941-REG, for $450,000, approved on 29 September 2000.\n18 TA __PRC: currently being processed.\n19 TA __PRC: currently being processed.", "4\ndepart from these norms, the TA team will examine the basis of such estimates and attempt to\nexplain the reasons for any anomalies. The status report will be prepared on the basis of agro-\necological  zones  (thus  enabling  the  causal  relationships  to  be  identified)  as  well  as\nadministrative  zones,  which  better  explain  the  institutional  responses  and  relationship  to\npoverty. Particular reference will be made to the recently completed nationwide survey of soil\nerosion undertaken by the Institute of Remote Sensing Applications on behalf of MWR.20\n14.  Identify economic losses associated with soil erosion and land degradation. The\nTA team will systematically document the economic and financial losses associated with land\ndegradation in the PRC, with a view to justifying the necessary level of expenditure for future\ncontrol programs. The analysis will examine the extent to which such losses impact more on the\npoor and the role that land degradation plays in creating and sustaining poverty in the PRC.\n15.  Document previous control strategies and programs. The TA team will document\nthe key policies, programs, and projects undertaken since enactment of the 1991 Water and\nSoil  Conservation  Law,  as  well  as  provide  a  brief  historical  context  of  former  strategies.\nEmphasis will be placed on the role of foreign aid-assisted projects and the extent to which\ninternational best practices have influenced soil and water conservation strategies in the PRC.\nThe TA team will document both internal and external best practices, and examine the extent to\nwhich PRC officials may benefit from closer relationships with international efforts to combat soil\nerosion and desertification, such as through the United Nations Convention for Combating\nDesertification (UNCCD) regional thematic program networks.21\n16. Prepare future scenarios, alternative strategies, costs, and outcomes. The TA team\nwill attempt to predict the likely outcomes if current strategies, existing programs, and recent\nlevels of funding  (i.e., business as usual) form the basis of the PRC\u2019s future national strategy\nfor soil and water conservation. An envelope of possible scenarios and their outcomes, covering\noptimistic and pessimistic assumptions, will be presented to decision makers, so that they can\nevaluate whether any change in approach is necessary. Assuming that the current strategies\nare suboptimal, the TA team will develop alternative strategies, based on international best\npractices  (para.  15),  to  enable  the  Government  to  accelerate  control  of  land  degradation\nthroughout the PRC. The costs of implementing these accelerated strategies, as well as specific\ngoals and targets for each five-year period, will be documented. A revised set of strategies is\nunlikely to be implemented unless the key stakeholders take strong ownership of the outcomes\nand feel that they have been adequately involved in the formulation process. The TA will provide\nfor  national  and  local  level  workshops  to  engage  policymakers,  practitioners,  and  other\nstakeholders in an analysis of the alternative strategies. This participatory process will aim to\ndevelop a consensus on the optimal set of strategies accepted by all stakeholders.\n17. Recommend  strategies,  action  plan,  and  institutions.  Once  there  is  adequate\nconsensus on the preferred strategies, the TA team will compile a short-term action plan, which\nwill be presented to an international workshop for external financiers. Priority projects will be\nstudied to a prefeasibility level, and a short-term public investment plan will be developed for\nadoption  by  the  Government.  The  current  separation  of  functions  between  biological  and\nstructural measures for soil and water conservation may not be optimal. In addition, international\nexperience indicates that grassroots stakeholder partnerships with Government may be more\neffective in combating land degradation, than heavy reliance on Government programs. The TA\nwill examine alternative institutional models, evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the current\n                                                \n20As this survey has details at the county level, an extra geographic information system (GIS) coverage related to\npoverty incidence will demonstrate the assumed high correlation between poverty and soil erosion.\n21The PRC hosts the network on desertification monitoring and assessment, while India hosts the agroforestry and\nsoil conservation network.", "5\ninstitutional arrangements in the PRC, and propose future directions for institutional reform, if\nwarranted.\n18. Design  monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  Evaluation  of  former  projects  and\nprograms to determine what works best has been minimal. Nationwide surveys at 5-10 year\nintervals  do  not  provide  adequate  input  for  annual  programming.  Reports  from  grassroots\norganizations  are  constrained  by  inadequate  training,  insufficient  equipment,  and  simple\nmonitoring techniques, and often state that predetermined targets have been achieved. The TA\nwill prepare a preliminary design of a more comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system,\nbased on a nationwide network of monitoring stations and simple monitoring techniques,22\ncombined with national level remote sensing and geographic information systems.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n19. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,060,000 equivalent, consisting of $380,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $680,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance\n$800,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost plus $420,000 equivalent of the\nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA\nProgram.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $260,000\nequivalent. The Government's financing will cover remuneration and per diem of counterpart\nstaff, office accommodation and supplies, local inland travel costs, local communications and\nreports, and surveys, investigations, and plans to be carried out by local design institutes during\nthe course of the study. The cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n20. The TA will be implemented by a team of international consultants in association with\ndomestic consultants. The consultants, to be engaged through a firm, will be selected by ADB in\naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other satisfactory arrangements\nfor the engagement of domestic consultants. The methodology and terms of reference are\nspecific and clearly identified. Hence, ADB\u2019s procedure for simplified technical proposal will be\nused to select the consultants (Project Administration Instructions, 3.01). A total of 58 person-\nmonths (10 international and 48 domestic) of consulting services will be required. Outline terms\nof reference are given in Appendix 3. TA implementation is expected to commence in January\n2001 and end in December 2001.\n21. The  Executing  Agency  will  be  MWR.  A  steering  committee  will  be  established\ncomprising senior staff of MWR, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, State Environment\nProtection Administration, SDPC, and SFA. An expert panel comprising 6-8 senior academics\nand officials will provide guidance to the TA consultants. Panel members will be paid a lump\nsum honorarium.  Three workshops will be organized by, and held in, renowned PRC research\ninstitutes, and involve a wide spectrum of stakeholders to consider alternative strategies and\nreach consensus on the national strategies. The TA will also provide funding for up to five\nscientists  to  prepare  peer-reviewed,  commissioned  papers  for  publication  in  international\njournals and present them at relevant international conferences or workshops.\nIV.
